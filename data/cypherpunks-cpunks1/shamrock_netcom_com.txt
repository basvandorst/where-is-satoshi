I personally know individuals that are avoiding medical care because of

Patient records stay around for years. Who knows what the requirements will
be five years from now? It would not surprise me if individuals who have
been seeking drug treatment within the last, say, five years would have to
be reported to the Klinton Kommunal Kare agency.
To be examined by the above supervisory agency upon "reasonable suspicion",
no doubt.

@_subject: Anonymous questionnaires 
My partner is a participant in a long term psychological study. I have been
asked to fill out a questionnaire to aid in this study. Some of the
questions address issues that I would never answer non-anonymously. After
speaking with the research director, I ended up with the following problem:
is there a way that would allow the institute to
1. Correlate my answers to the answers of my partner.
2. Verify that I have indeed sent in a filled out questionnaire (and send
me a check for participating).
3. Allow a supervisory agency, such as the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, to verify that the researchers did not just make up all the
data - that is to allow an audit.
4. Protect my privacy by making it impossible to correlate my name to the
answers given.
I would very much like to help to advance medical knowledge, but am
concerned what might happen once the institute is forced to hand over all
accumulated data to the Kommunal Kare Kontrol Kommittee under the Health
Care and Crime Prevention Act of 1998.
The researchers seem to think that there is no way to satisfy all the above
criteria. I, after following discussions on this list for a long time, am
not so sure. I intend to forward any workable suggestions (if the problem
even has a solution) to the researchers. I am sure that better privacy
protection would not only increase the number of participants, but also the
quality of the data.

You can open an HTTP server using the excellent MacHTTP, a ftp site using

 I am not so sure about the keyserver, though. I suppose it might be
possible to write an AppleScript for the new scriptable versions of MacPGP

enough keyservers out there.

@_subject: McCoy is Right! New Mail Format to Start Now. 
The thread is back...
After reading many of your posts on the MIME issue, I have come to the
conclusion that you _are_ wedded to a past long gone. I have not give up
the hope that we will one day convice you stop accessing the net via the
worst possible interface, a terminal server. The way you are using the net
is through 1950's technology with 1950's results.
You say that you use stuff that is far beyond ASCII and I believe you.
However, one wouldn't know from hearing what tools you are using to access
the net. You are competent, a computer person, but still you don't seem to
understand that reading mail via a terminal server and elm is like having
an oxen pull your car.
You got Eudora. Setting up tia ($25) on your account and downloading
Newswatcher, etc. takes less than an hour. In fact, I will gladly do it for
you. After the clients are set up on your own machine, there is no reason
to go back to using the shell. I have used the shell *two* times in the
last three months. -- To change my password.
You wouldn't have to change your workhabits. You could still read news,
answer email, and surf the web all at the same time. In fact, you could do
it better and easier than you do it now.
I have AppleScript droplets on my desktop for all the people I work with.
Drag the spreadsheet icon on it. Hit "Queue". They double click on it on
their desktop. Happens every day.
This list is email and, yes, it is in ASCII. There is little reason to
change that. But that doesn't mean that most of the net is in ASCII. I
spend less than half the time that I am on the net in a pure ASCII
environment. And it is getting less every month.
I hate to break it to you, but it is no longer "most of us" who don't use
these tools. And of the ones that don't use them, only very, very, few
don't have them available.
I don't think that you are wishing for a "simpler world". I believe that
you haven't realized that the "simpler world" has long vanished in the dust
of history and that you are one of the last hold outs living in an era
past. Please don't be the last to leave.

People don't deal with MIME. Computers do. The average user shouldn't be
any more concerned with MIME info than with IP header length. That your
inadequate and buggy mailreader exposes you to the inner workings of MIME
shouldn't be held against the standard.
The two (email and web) are not alternatives, as you have stated in your
previous post. Email has gone to MIME. HTTP couldn't exist without MIME.
What on earth is your problem with MIME? Your posts read like they come
from someone who complains about 8 bit data on the net because everytime
they display it on their terminal it makes strange noises and generally
screws things up.
PLEASE stop using your VTwhatever emulator and you will find that MIME
becomes a non-issue. Out of sight, out of mind. All you will notice is that
all of a sudden you get more out of the net while finding it simpler to

I have the same type of shell account with Netcom that you have. However,
thanks to The Internet Adapter I turned that shell account into a SLIP
connection. If you have a shell account, you can convert it into a SLIP
account. It is as simple as that. Not that it mattered much for MIME email.
Eudora can handle that via dial-up just as well. Sure helps for browsers,
though. Accessing the web through Lynx is a joke. Even if you have image
loading turned off in the browser to conserve bandwidth, _anything_ is
better than Lynx.
Perhaps we can find some common ground here. You don't want to have to use
UNIX. You like your Mac, don't you? So why interact with a lousy terminal
server if you can do all the things you can do there - and more - the Mac
way? Think about it. All the benefits of a Mac interface without giving up
the benefits you get from Netcom. (No, I don't work for TIA. I am just a
VERY satisfied customer.)
Any of the mailers that you can use on a shell are oxen. Anything that can
be used over a VT100 emulator is an oxen. (At least where non-ASCII display
data is concerned).
You are fighting a lost cause and you know it. VT100 is dead. No, you are
not the last of your tribe. I should hope that you have the good sense to
come around before that happens. All your friends here sure hope for it.

All I got is 9600.
Well, perhaps I can interested you in QuickNet (16MEGAbps, thats an
Ethernet, two video channels and several phonelines, all running over the
very same 4 wires that are already in your wall) but in order for that to
become available, you have to help convince Congress that local telco
de-regulation is a Good Thing.
Seriously, how do you get 100 kbps over a 14.4 kbps line? Even with the
best compression you won't get that kind of throughput.
Whatever througput rate you get from the shell, you can get via SLIP.
Gladly :-)
Lets assume for a moment that you get much faster throughput by zmodem'ing
a file from the shell than by ftp'ing it via SLIP (some users have reported
that zmodem from the shell is faster than ftp, but the differece is
marginal at best. I have never been able to verify the claim.)
Having tia on your shell account doesn't affect your ability to use the
shell in any way. If you are so inclined, you can still download files from
the shell as you did before. You can also turn the shell into a SLIP
connection with in seconds. Nothing lost, plenty gained.
You don't have to shell out at all. If you ever need to use the shell (to
change your .profile, .plan, password, etc) you can just telnet to your
account. I usually just hang up and call via the terminal emulator the one
time per month I do that, but there really is not need to do so.
As for MIME, which started this tread, no SLIP is needed, There are several
dial-up mailers that handle MIME just fine. As for SLIP, in many areas it
has become as cheap as a shell account. In San Francisco, SLIP is cheaper
than a shell account ($15/month flat rate). For those with an overpriced
local SLIP provider, or those who also want a shell there is TIA.

I was afraid of this...
I _love_ UNIX. I do not want to see it replaced. What I claim is that 7bit
terminals and terminal emulators are a piece of history. My message is that
the use of non-ASCII displayable data on the net is growing and that
character based terminals are unable to handle the way information will
(is) be(ing) presented. UNIX can handle graphics just fine, just VT100
There can be no other lasting solution but to abandon VTwhatever in favor
of bitmaped output devices. Since running X over a dial-up connection is
rather inefficient, and considering the significant computing power of the
PC's that are now being underused as dumb terminals, processing the data
locally seems to be a sensible solution.

Re-reading the above paragraph, you know that in the long tern there is
only one answer.
There are a lot of new tools out there. Some will survive the test of time,
others won't. But if anything, there is less chaos today than there was two
years ago. Two years ago, nobody used URLs. They typically described the
location of a file as such: "You can get the file at ftp foo.bar.com, its
in the pub/mac directory, I think it's called wonder.sit."
So you hit ^Z to get out of tin, type ncftp, type all the stuff above, hope
it is right - it probably isn't - find the file, get it, type "quit", type
sz wonder.sit, get up to fetch a cup of coffee instead of just sitting
there and staring at the screen while the file is being transfered to your
machine, drink the coffee, ten minutes later you type "fg". Back to tin.
Neato, isn't it?
Today, most posters on USENET have learned to use URLs and it has become
easier to do so, because more and more programs supports them. This is how
the above exchange works today:
I read my news with Newswatcher. Someone mentions the new hot piece of
software at ftp://foo.bar.com/pub/mac/wonder.sit. I option-click anywhere
on the URL. Newswatcher passes it to Anarchie for retrieval in the
background. I read the next post.
I say, burn all the VT52 terminals of this world to fuel the fire of progress.
Toss the 2400 bps modems in there, too. I know that few folks will feel sad
over the long overdue end of the ASCII era.
I can, of the top of my head, name five friends with computers who, after
seeing the VT100 display of a shell account, refused to have anything to do
with the Internet. "You got be joking. I am not dealing with *this*." Now
years later and after much evangelizing and MacWeb demonstrations, they are
finally begining to show interest. The dialog was always the same: "I won't
have to do any work in one of those terminal windows, will I?" -- "I
promise, you won't." -- "Good, because I hate this ASCII garbage."
It typically takes me 1-2 hours to install and configure everything on
their machines. Yes, it is true, I have spent many hundered hours obtaining
the knowlege in the first place, but I am willing to share my knowledge
with anyone who asks. As for my friends, they all have been very happy with
their new tools. None of them has so far expressed any interest in the
telnet client that I have included.
Happy netting,

I don't want to restart the "If the output wont work on a stack of
Hollister cards the system sucks" thread, but Tim is here, as he is most of
the time, right. After two years, we still have not made it much simpler to
integrate PGP/whatever into a mixed OS environment.
Few readers on this list would think that Tim is not dilligent enough. A
forged message would not be able to fool us for long. The problems is that
is no simple way to integrate PGP with the many newsreaders, mailers, etc.,
that are being used on the net. This is unlikely to change until there is a
new, acceptable, RFC for mail that implements digital signatures and
encyption (if desired) without user intervention.
Yes, choice is what Cypherpunks are (I hope) about. Choice through crypto.
Unless crypto spreads we will face ever reduced choice. Crypto will not
spread unless there is a demand.
Most people, including one of (the?) leading thinker(s) of the group on the
net that most supports cryptography believe that the added security and
privacy that cryptography provides are not worth typing a few commands or
clicking a few buttons. I myself rarely, if ever, sign my post. If WE don't
even use crypto ourselves, who do you think else uses it and who do you
think will therfore care if the government chooses to outlaw it?
We don't have a motivation to use crypto. We all realize that there is
really no need to encrypt/sign the vast majority of the stuff we are
sending. There may be the occasional message that we will encrypt and we
are well aware that we encrypt that message for the very reasons that the
powers-that-be want to see encryption outlawed.
There are no better tools for integration of crypto today, because there
has been no need. The few times you actually need crypto you can punch the
commands "by hand".
I do not mean to belittle the work that has been done, but unless the
encryption is built into the mailer and using a remailer means clicking the
"use  X remailer(s)" button, and the mailer better know which ones are
working and do the PGP envelopes, it won't happen.
Hell, I have been on this list for two years and today I decided against
posting that updater everyone was begging for to USENET because I didn't
want to spend the 15 minutes it would take me to look up the address of a
mail-to-usenet gateway, find out which remailers are working, binhex the
thing, and past it into the remailer interface. Yes, I know the 3 or 4
URL's it would take to do all that.  Suppose the world will have to wait
until that computer makers's FTP site is up again.  /dev/null>
We are stuck: No need -> no development of tools -> no spreading of crypto
beyond the "hard core" -> no public resitance when crypto becomes illegal.
So how can we prevent crypto from becomming illegal? Just follow the above
chain backwards. Create a need. Create mailing lists that require signed
messages. Create ftpsites that require signed uploads or whatever. Require
the use of crypto. Not to partake in some involuntary interaction with the
government (that will happen without out help), but for some voluntary
interactions between people on the net. Sending mail to cypherpunks is such
a voluntary interaction. Requiring it here just might result in better
tools in the long run. Just an idea, if it sounds like garbage, forget
about it.

that requiring it for posting just might get people to do it.

@_subject: Introduction: Telephone traffic analysis 
I stumbled upon this great explanation of telephone traffic analysis and
thought I'd share it with the list:
Remember also, as far as security goes, that individuals always have the
ability to add their own encryption to a system.  But I would argue that
encryption is also of minimal protection against a knowledgable telephone
company or government with message traffic flow tracking capability.  This is a
capability that every phone company has since they use it to generate your bill
every month.
Consider the following:
Some undesirable activity (to the govt or phoneco) is happening.  The
govt/phoneco (govco) is able to identify one or more persons involved. (now
known as targets.)
Targets:            *1*         *2*         *3*
They track and compare the frequency of calling patterns made by the targets.
Now they know the "calling circle" of the targets.  They expand the tracking
pattern and start looking for cross overs.
Targets:            *1*         *2*         *3*
                   / | \       / | \         |
Level 1:          A  B  C     D  E  A        F
When they start to find a commonality (by Phone # or account holder(s)) they
can begin to build the list of those persons most often called within the
identified target group. In the above 'A' is common to targets *1* and *2*,
thereby implying that the "group" is composed of *1*, *2*, and 'A'.  Those most
often  called are the "key communicators", regardless of any formal or informal
organization or public presence.
By iterating this process recursively the entire organization and any
supporting sympathizers can eventually be located. Both by members of the
target group and by others outside the group who may not have any knowledge of
other members of the group or even of themselves being in a group. Further,
since all phone numbers are tied in the planning databases to physical
locations and to billing addresses, enough data can be gathered to completely
locate and identify (for further evidence research and cross referencing)
members and supporters.
Notice that this works even in those cases where no formal organization exists.
Notice that this works regardless of whether the communications in question are
encrypted or not.
Applying this means that a movement, or any organized or coordinated activity
could be disrupted by proper targeting of those who are the true key
communicators.  Actions as simple and subtle as cutting off phone service,
placing bad credit reports, starting a tax audit, getting the person a better
paying job in a different area, etc., etc. could all be just as effective as
outright arrest and harassment.  If they don't work, then things would
So consider this as well and don't rely just on encryption to keep yourself

of children abducted every year". Many parents would jump at the anything
that might increase the chance of recovering their children should they be
abducted. Just take a look at lines during "Child Fingerprint Days" at you
local mall.
The solution? Transponder implants at birth. Modern transponders can be
injected into an infant where they grow into the tissue, unable to be
removed without major surgery. If schools make implants a requirenment,
such as vaccinations are today, children can be routinely scanned when
entering kindergarden. Later in life, the same transponders can be used to
verify legal age for obtaining a driver license or purchasing alcohol. The transpoders also provide ID for the ATMs and credit card termials of
the future. No criminal can loot your account. You can leave the ATM card
at home. How convenient! How do you prevent the dead from voting? Simple. One transponder, one vote.
Even better, childmolesters, individuals out on bail or parole, and other
"security risks" can be similarily tagged to prevent escape from US
jurisdiction.  A combination metal detector/scanner for airport and border
use is just one of the obvious ideas to increase the value of this
For an example of such a transponder see
I predict that you will see the first such implants in children within
five years. An enterprising Cypherpunk who has become disillusiond that
the statists can be stopped could make a fortune by offering a "Children's

[Well done, Ian!]
Since an online clearing protocol is being used, the bank has no need to
identify double spenders. The bank will simply refuse to honor a double
spent coin. In fact, cancelling a payment in this protocol is done by just
depositing the coin yourself.
I can't help the feeling that I am missing something whenever you bring up
this question. Assuming it could be done. What would David gain? He as the
payor is anonymous to Sam either way. Sam still would have to be worried
about being identified, since if Charlie gives David access to Charlie's
wallet, it is safe to assume that Charlie will give David (and the mint)
access to his blinding factor. Which in turn would reveal Sam as the payee.
The protocol you suggest gives the parties exactly what they would have if
they just used Ecash "out of the box": full payor anonymity, no payee
anonymity. So why bother?

Absolutely. Wildcard coins are stealable in transit. However, one might

other methods.
Your analysis is correct. The good news, for the free marketers on this

Here's a question for all the gurus out there: I work for a company that
manufactures a new concept in telephony hardware. The system we developed
essentially replaces PBXs with an off-the-shelf computer, some special
cards, and some software. Our system will offer all the features that you'd
expect from current PBXs, such as least cost routing, as well as other
features that can't be provided by a standard PBX.
When a customer sets up a site, the system connects via a modem to our
server, from which the system retrieves software, routing tables, etc. We
also offer periodic software updates, and software based add-on features
for an additional free. We would like to be able to upgrade, and in some
cases control, the sites by remote and we would like the customer to be
able to purchase extra software from us via modem or over the net. We use
TCP/IP and SNMP to comunicate with the sites. We want to include strong
crypto from the begining for several purposes:
-Link encryption between the customer sites and us.
-Authentication of the upgrade software.
-Secure purchases and transmision of software both via dial-up and the Internet.
-Optional encryption of the (telephony) data carried between sites.
I understand that the last issue is somewhat different from the others, I
just mentioned it to complete the picture. For now I need a solution for
the first two or three questions. We need something that can be delivered
to the customer six months from now, not something that may make it out of
a standard comittee years from now.

one might feel when going from a typewriter to a computer with MS Works
preinstalled. But we both know that MS Work is often not the best tool for
the job. It spreadsheet pales compared to Excel, its wordprocessor lacks
features, etc. Consequently, many people that buy a computer packaged with
Works end up replacing or augmenting Works with other, specialized,
programs that do a better job at many of the tasks that Works claims to
Netscape is, in many regards, just like Works. It has a sub-standard
newsreader, a featureless mailer -- but a very nice browser. So many
people use Netscape for a browser and other programs for other tasks,
because other programs are better suited for it than Netscape.
When Robert mentioned that he was wondering how you would think about
Netscape in six months, he was perhaps thinking what most experienced Mac
using netsurfers know:
The various leading Mac Internet programs are excellent modular tools
that, thanks to cooperation between the various authors, are tighly
integrated. Often, the same key combinations that work in one progamm,
work in the other. They are small, they are fast, and they can call each
other. The only odd man out is Netscape, which tries to do it all by
itself and therefore does nothing right.
Once someone tries Anarchie for ftp, or one of the enhanced (current
leader seems to be Y.A.) Newswatchers for USENET, there is no going back
to just Netscape. I remeber writing here once that after someone tries surfing the Web with
Mosaic, there is no going back to just using lynx. The same holds true for
Anarchie, Newswatcher, Eudora -- and Netscape.

advertized. They all invariably fail to wipe the slackspace at the end of
allocated, but not fully used blocks. Consequently, several kB of data
left behind in said slackspace by previously deleted files will be missed
on your average drive.

Yes, it might, because of the strong support by vendors for voluntary GAK
or no crypto at all. Let me explain. There are a number of indicators that
show that strong crypto is losing in the global marketplace. Example: the
charter of the new IETF Internet Payment Systems working group requires
that the use of crypto be limited. In the discussion about the charter,
the near unanimous consent (with myself as the sole dissenter) was that
crypto may only be used for authentication, not confidentiality.
It is true that the prospect of loosening the rules for crypto
software/hardware implementations is a major motivator in the marketplace.
The whole development of National Semi's iPower PCMCIA card was driven by
a promise made by the NSA of high lot numbers due to (future?) relaxed
export rules. I suppose that trapdoors in hardware are much harder to find
than trapdoors in software.

A number of months ago, I discovered that various Macintosh "unused
diskspace" wipe utilities (Norton, Burn) fail to wipe the unused
slackspace at the end of the last block allocated to a file. This leaves
NumberOfFiles*512Bytes/2 = several kB of recoverable data on your average
I had assumed that this data was left there by other files previously
using the same block. This would certainly be a problem. But I discovered
that matters are much worse. The Macintosh file system will always write
an entire block. The extra data can therefore not come from an old file.
It comes from the memory space immediately following the data to be
written. This is a very serious security risk. Your decrypted secret key,
ANYTHING in memory might be written to disk and remain there, unerasable
by disk wipe utilities.
I would appreciate some comments.

So it is harder to compile dosiers on people. Big deal. The recipient can
still determine who gets the goods paied for by the "anonymous" ecash by
conventional means (hint: shipping address), so the payee anonymity is of
little value as far as protecting the privacy of the payer (most likely
the recipient of the goods) is concerened.
Ecash of course is of *no* value for the various assasination markets,
drug dealing, money laundring, etc that routinely get mentioned in the
same paragraph as Ecash. The reason is the *full traceability* of the
payee that has been deliberately built into the current version of Ecash.
A "feature" that you may rest assured will be part of all future versions
backed by anyone with even marginal reputation in the financial markets.

The former I have seen happen, the latter never.  In the former case a
tax document was "lost" by the witness's accountant who was in Moldavia
and could not be located.  The judge, reasonably, thought the witness
was full of it.  He imposed a per day fine, and after a time
incarcerated the witness before the accountant was (finally) located and
testified (by long distance telephone and intrepreter) that the
documents have been lost in a fire at the national administration
building, proof of which was entered in the form of newpaper articles.
A motion to quash the fine was granted.  The court apologized for the
incarceration.  Fines that are large and seem reasonable in the heat of
court are more likely to get quashed when a judge who wasn't there later
reviews it.  Still, this is rare.
As to the latter, that doesn't mean it won't, but seems unlikely.  You
don't usually get paid for the time you lose in court either, unless you
sue for wrongful prosecution or costs which require malicious and
wrongful prosecution.  (Unlikely, extremely hard to prove or get a court
to enforce).  Pay your own costs tends to include opportunity cost of
time in court.

Transponders will be affixed to all items of luggage and all passengers. If

Why embedding the transponder in a hand carried item, such as a card, will
not work is left as an exercise to the reader. Even an affixed device does

     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     MICRON COMMUNICATIONS, INC., ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL
     AVIATION ADMINISTRATION
     Boise, Idaho, August 2, 1996 - Micron Communications, Inc., today
     announced a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRDA)
     with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to develop a model
     Positive Passenger Baggage Matching (PPBM) system. The objective
     of this PPBM system is to automatically recognize when baggage has
     been placed on an aircraft without an associated passenger. Micron
     Communications intends to utilize remote intelligent
     communications (RIC) technology developed for its MicroStamp�
     family of products to design a security system which will enhance
     current systems and provide efficient tracking of passengers and
     baggage.
     "Micron Communications is proud to be associated with products
     that are designed to help increase the safety of airline travel,
     while providing operational benefits to the industry and
     increasing the convenience to the traveler," said John R. Tuttle,
     Chairman and President of Micron Communications, Inc. "Our
     experience in microelectronics and systems design should enable us
     to develop systems that use tomorrow's technology in finding
     solutions to these important problems."
     "Once again, an Idaho company is breaking new ground," Senator
     Larry Craig said. "As chairman of the Congressional-White House
     Task Force on Terrorism, its exciting to see this kind of
     high-tech advancement in security being developed here at home by
     Micron Communications, Inc. The Positive Passenger Baggage
     Matching system is exactly the kind of common-sense answer we are
     looking for to improve airline safety and give us all greater
     comfort when we fly in the future, " Craig continued.
     Current MicroStamp-based products include the MicroStamp credit
     card-sized device and the MicroStamp Engine� in a 20-pin,
     small-outline integrated circuit (SOIC) plastic package. Micron
     Communications believes that the MicroStamp integrated circuit is
     the first wireless communications technology to integrate a
     single-chip CMOS solution, which includes a direct sequence spread
     spectrum (DSSS) microwave-frequency radio operating at 2.45GHz, a
     microcontroller, and low-power static random access memory (SRAM).
     It also contains a synchronous serial port allowing additional
     memory expansion.
     RIC units are different from RFID tags because they have a central
     processing unit (CPU), memory and microwave on board. This
     combination allows RIC units to perform more applications than
     low-performance RFID tags that use older technology at lower
     frequencies. MicroStamp RIC units are more powerful and more
     flexible than RFID units. They are also smaller and cost less than
     other RIC units of comparable performance.
     Systems integrators, original equipment manufacturers or end users
     interested in the MicroStamp family of products should contact
     Micron Communications Customer Service department, 1-888-MSTAMP1,
     (888-678-2671).

I am glad to see some movement in this area. I designed a similar system
for a previous employer of mine. But the real choke point is the local
loop. As of this day, the local telos still have a de facto monopoly in the
local markets. The new competitors (the same old Phone Company) that we
will see in the near future seem to show no desire to deliver the really
interesting services that are now possible. They long distance carriers
about to enter the local markets plan to offer the same old stuff at a
(perhaps) somewhat lower price.
The company I used to work for has technology capable of delivering a 10
Mb/s Ethernet plus 100 ISDN B channels to your home, using the very same
wires already in your wall. Keep this in mind next time you hear what great
new services the local telcos are about to offer. Then demand better.

Thanks for kind words. I am happy to hear that your RBOC is so enlightened.
I did not mean to exclusively blame the Baby Bells. There is plenty of
blame to go around. Look at the FCC's incomprehensible decision to require
that an ISDN line be billed as two lines, arguing that it requires double
the upstream bandwidth.
I know that I am repeating myself, but here is a brief primer on telco
There is plenty of upstream bandwidth, since everything but the local loop
is already running on fiber. The problem is in the local loop. In many
cities, there is simply no room left in the ducts to run even one more
wire. Anything, such as ISDN, that can get more lines out of the same
number of wires is a Good Thing to the telcos and the consumers. The
alternative is trenching. An often prohibitively expensive proposal,
especially in a downtown area. The FCC should encourage, not discourage the
use of such wire saving technology.
Given the cost of running fiber to the home, the near and intermediate
future is definitely fiber to the curb. The technology we were developing
works beautifully with this set-up. To be more precise, the system provides
a 10Mbps Ethernet, 96 64bps ISDN B channels, a D and an M channel if using
iso-Ethernet based technology. But the key to getting all this bandwidth
isn't iso-Ethernet, it was our chip. This can be done at ~$600/home and for
a low as $100 per node. Yes, this will increase upstream bandwidth
requirements, but as I mentioned earlier, there is plenty of upstream
bandwidth. Last office I worked in was facing an alley full of loading
docks and trash binns. Six feet away from the door ran MFS's OC-48 SONET.
There are of course exceptions. If you live in a very old building, you
might have to rewire. My current apartment uses three wire cabling. I have
no idea what the third wire is good for. You can't run two POTS over three
wires. In a building like this you'd have to rewire. But few office
buildings are likely to have such lousy wiring.
Anyway, I hate to be a tease, but that's about as far as my NDA will let me go.

[Sorry, the last one went out without a subject]
HP is in the process of ramroding a pro-GAK, pro-export control resolution through CommerceNet's public policy working group.
Here are the details.
HP is marketing several DES products that currently can not be sold abroad. In order to be allowed to sell these products, HP is willing to give the USG the following in return:
1.  Support by CommerceNet to have GAK built into the (inevitable) domestic PKI. [Their presentation included the word "voluntary". When I asked what was meant by that, I got the reply "There are many interpretations of the word "voluntary"." Suffice to say there are fundamental differences in what I mean by "voluntary" and what their proposal would require the definition of "voluntary" to be.]
2.  Support by CommerceNet for export restrictions on stronger forms of crypto than DES as well as restrictions on export of crypto for products not directly related (in HP's opinion) to ecommerce, such as email.
This ill conceived attempt to use CommerceNet's clout as industry organization to liberalize export rules on HP's products, and those of a few other companies supporting HP in this effort, at a heavy cost to everybody else, must be stopped. Please let HP know how you feel about their initiative and encourage CommerceNet to adopt an anti-GAK, anti-export control position.

When Wernher von Braun (if the reader doesn't know who von Braun was, shame
on your teachers. Hint: first human on the Moon.) first became interested
in rocketry, he was a student of music. Classical piano, to be exact. He
got his hands on a book about using rockets for space exploration. To his
dismay, the book was full of mathematical equations. He went to his math
teacher, asking him for help with the equations. The teacher must have been
of help, since von Braun went on to become the single most knowledgable
person in his field. And no, it wasn't piano playing.
There is nothing like some real life challenges to spark a young person's
mind. Today, conducting the experiments that fueled von Braun's imagination
would be a felony. The mere posession of the chemicals he used in his early
twenties is illegal.
This country has set out on a project to dumb the minds of its young. With

[Sorry, I don't have the attribution for the fist quote. The remainder of

military SIGINT. He allowed me to forward it to the list.]
    Look - if it uses electricity; if there is an oscillator
    anywhere innit; if there is a ground loop in the circuit design,
    if there are make/break contacts anywhere - It will     radiate, and the amount it radiates is directly proportional
    to the basic power source ...  And circuit board traces are
    getting so damned close that engineers I know/knew were
    worried about friggin' arc-over at 3 volts.  By now, may be
    even closer and voltage worries lower...
    So we have a problem. The only computer I know of that
    is (at this date) leak-proof is the biological one
    'twixt one's ears.  And soon, maybe not even that.  Those
    who laugh at the paranoiacs who wear aluminum helmets and
    wear shoes with a static strap to the sidewalk may
    be laughing out the other side of their moufs too soon...
    As for any government directives requiring companies to make     computers leak, I know of none, but CAVEAT: I've been retired
    from source info since '91, and most of my friends/fellow engrs
    who occasionally got together for a few brewskis and BS sessions
    over in Mt. View have either gone to better jobs (more $$$),
    transferred back east, or inconsiderately died.  So, who
    knows?     And of course, the ability to detect this RF/RFI/EMI leakage        from your information processor is similarly dependent
    on the sensitivity of the equipment you're using for     detection.  I've seen absolute magic performed using     a Wullenweber antenna, and that is NOT state-of-the-art
    equipment any more (ca. 1965-70), even tho the DoD keeps throwing     money at it in upgrades (affectionately called 'the     elephant's cage' by those who worked with it).
    If you really need to keep your information processing
    "private", then you can either isolate yourself inside
    a double-shielded room of solid copper; power everything
    with batteries; have no wires leading out of that room;
    make damned sure the door has the nice secure wiping strips
    to complete the shield when you close it -- or move your
    information processor into the middle of a whole bunch of
    the same or worse RF/RFI/EMI emitters, and just _maybe_
    your data will get lost or become inaccessible because
    of the overload of the detection equipment by much larger
    interference fields.
    Or use paper, pencil, and one-time pads and burn everything
    that's done "in the clear" and really scrunch the ashes into
    dust.

It has been speculated in the past that certain crypto schemes, such as
proposed by Microsoft and Sun, using signed crypto plugins might be helpful
to the cause for strong crypto if non-US branches of US software companies
would certify foreign developed crypto software.
According to the recent proposal by Commerce, this will not happen. It will
be illegal to export the software required to sign the code. So much for
the government's claim that they make no attempt to limit the export of
signing-only software.
[Listing specific software prohibited from export]

And, btw, virus checkers are also prohibited from export. Makes you wonder.

Fellow firearms friends,
The Cypherpunks Shooting Club will meet this Sunday, 12/14/96, the day
after the monthly Bay Area Cypherpunks Meeting. From now on, we will meet
once a month, on the day after the monthly meeting.
Anyone interested in firearms is encouraged to attend. You don't need to
own a gun and you don't need to know how to operate one. Of course, if you
do, all the better. Various firearms (rifles, handguns, shotguns) will be
available. We will gladly provide safety and operations instructions.
When: 2:00 pm 12/14/96
Where: United Sportsmen Rifle Range, Ebora Road, Concord, CA, 510-676-1963
How to get there:
o From SF, Oakland, the North Bay: [Cross the bridge to the East Bay if
Take I580 to Highway 24 to WALNUT CREEK. In Walnut Creek, the 24 merges
with I680. Follow I680 NORTH. Past Concord, take Highway 4 EAST. Drive for
a few miles. Note the nuclear weapons depot on the right. Just past the
depot, exit on WILLOW PASS ROAD. Make a LEFT on Willow Pass Road. Cross
underneath the highway. At the end of the road, make a RIGHT. Drive 3/4 of
a mile. United Sportsmen is the second dirt road on the LEFT. If you
reached some homes, you went too far.
o From the Peninsula: Take San Mateo Bridge to the East Bay. Go NORTH for a
few miles. Take the freeway EAST (number?) to LIVERMORE. At the PLEASANTON
interchange, take I680 NORTH. Follow the instructions above.
Why we are meeting in the East Bay: Several regular participants are
already meeting Sunday morning in Berkeley.
What if it rains: The outdoor range is an all weather range. We will meet
unless it really pours.
Cost: $5 range fee + ammunition. $15 total should suffice for a first timer.
What to bring:
o Eye protection [mandatory]. Prescription and sunglasses meet the
requirements, though I would advise you to use something safer. Chemistry
lab glasses work great.
o Ear protection [mandatory]. If needed, you can buy some foam type ear
protection at the range. It costs less than $5.
o Any firearm you might want to bring.
Please RSVP if you plan to attend.
See you Sunday,

@_subject: New crypto regs outlaw financing non-US development 
As you know, the President has transferred most crypto from State to
Commerce. We were all waiting in anticipation for the text of new
regulations to take effect on 12/30/96. Not because we thought that the new
regs will be more favorable to industry and the individual (we know
better), but so we could assess the damage. I will try to give a brief look
at some interesting provisions in the new regs. I assume the reader is
familiar with the carrot and stick (export of single DES and key escrow)
provision of the new regs. IANAL.
This post refers to the text of the regulations available at
 and
The above URL's mirror [Federal Register: December 30, 1996 (Volume 61,
Number 251)], also available via
First the good news: the export controls mentioned in the draft of the regs
on any kind of data security software, regardless if it uses crypto or not
did not carry into the final version.
Now to the rest of the news. The GAK provisions require that the keys are made available without
knowledge of the user. This disqualifies some of the suggested key recovery
schemes alerting the user to the fact that keys are being requested.
Printed source can still be exported. Source printed in special OCR fonts
will eventually be banned.
Finally, to the big one:
IMHO, this closes the door on the foreign contracting loophole used by C2
and others. It is now illegal for US persons to finance or contract out
overseas crypto development, since doing so will obviously assist in
proliferation. While not unexpected (I offered a bet on Cypherpunks that
this would happen. Nobody took the bet.), this provision sets a dangerous
precedence. The technical assistance prohibitions of the past have been
transformed into general prohibitions against "financing, contracting,
service, support, transportation, freight forwarding, or employment".
Again, IANAL.

The language of the new regulations supports this view. It seems to me that
the USG wanted to ban easily scannable text, but wasn't sure how to best
define "easily scannable". This is a property that is difficult to define.
Once they come up with a workable definition, expect the regs to be amended.
As Michael Froomkin has noted, this will require an act of Congress. I
expect the administration to send a pro-GAK bill to Congress in 1997.

It seems to me that the authors of the regulations have come to the same
conclusion. Which is why the ban on scannable text is not in the current
version of the regs. But the regulators want to see scannable source banned
that much is clear. At the same time, they do not want to run up against
the wide ranging protections printed speech enjoys.
I expect the solution ultimately employed to use a method similar to what
is currently used in color copiers and digital audio mastering equipment.
Normal color copiers will copy just about all colors except the particular
shade of green used in US currency. Consumer digital audio recording
equipment makes use of copy protection features. Only hideously expensive
"professional" equipment has the copy protection turned off.
We might see something similar for printed source and OCR programs. Printed
source will have to be printed in a specific font. A font that OCR programs
are required to not recognize. OCR programs that do recognize this specific
font will of course be export controlled.

I just got of the phone with Bruce Kutz, Export Policy Analyst, Office of
Strategic Trade and Foreign Policy Controls. (202) 482-0092. He seems to be
the contact person for the new regs.
I pointed Mr. Kutz to the section that alarmed me:
Sec. 736.2  General prohibitions and determination of applicability.
     * * * * *
         (7) General Prohibition Seven--Support of Certain Activities by
     U.S. persons--(i) Support of Proliferation Activities (U.S. Person
     Proliferation Activity). If you are a U.S. Person as that term is
     defined in Sec. 744.6(c) of the EAR, you may not engage in any
     activities prohibited by Sec. 744.6 (a) or (b) of the EAR which
     prohibits the performance, without a license from BXA, of certain
     financing, contracting, service, support, transportation, freight
     forwarding, or employment that you know will assist in certain
     proliferation activities described further in part 744 of the EAR.
     There are no License Exceptions to this General Prohibition Seven in
     part 740 of the EAR unless specifically authorized in that part.
Mr. Kutz seemed surprised. Apparently he had not been aware that this
section was included in the new crypto regs. He then assured me that
1. Proliferation in the context of this paragraph applies only to
proliferation of
a) nuclear (bomb) technology
b) missile technology
He read to me EAR Sec. 744.6 (a) or (b), which are referred to in the
paragraph in question. Sec. 744.6 (a) or (b) seems to support this view.
However, he did not explain to me why the paragraph was included in the
crypto export regulations when it only applies to nukes and missiles.
2. The Department of Commerce has no intention of banning the financing and
contracting of non-US crypto development.
3. Technical assistance to non-US parties requires a license.
Mr. Kutz encouraged me to make use of the public comment period and ask
Commerce to clarify the section. Public comments will be accepted until
February 13, 1997. [Public comment is requested only after the new regs
took effect...]
I received the impression that Mr. Kutz genuinely believes that the section
in question does not apply to crypto. If I was concerned about potentially
violating the regulations, I would try to get a written statement from
Commerce that Mr. Kutz's view is indeed correct. As always, IANAL.

before they ran out of money. My calculations show that you can deliver
close to T1 speed to corporate customers at fraction of the cost using land
lines. In the best case scenario, you can produce the individual connection
at below $200. No land line based ISP can ever touch that. The total cost
for a land line based IPS is at least $395/T1. Set-up fee is lower too.
Best, the whole thing can be set up self financing. If I wasn't so busy

It is my understanding that you would be welcome to issue MT Ecash for USD.

You can get by with one base station per five remote receivers. This is no
different than the 5/1 to 12/1 oversale ratios common to the T1 ISP
business. As long as you prohibit resale of bandwidth and specialize in
hooking up business lans you'll have no problems with this layout. Latency,
which really is more important than bandwidth in many cases, is actually
better using wireless than using traditional T1s. The set-up costs are also
less to the customer than if they used a regular ISP. Only difference is
that by paying the set-up fees they are buying the equipment for _you_. So
once they leave your ISP, you still have all the hardware :-)
900MHz spread spectrum can get a bit crowded, but you don't need to sell
200 connections to make money. Breakeven based on competitive montly fees
(in my original calculations that ment less than the lowest priced local
ISP) is about 10 customers. Of course this is not at <$200 per customer.
That figure is the lowest possible if you max out a T3, but still, no
landline based ISP will be able to deliver bandwidth that cheap. Remember
that the fees _include_ the cost for the pipe. Breakeven based on the
set-up fees (meaning zero dollars investment by you) is about 18 customers.
All major wireless vendors offer DES encryption at about $300 per node.

Hi, David. :-]
David is correct. Strong crypto standardization and integration have made
little progress in the last two years. This is not about to change. In
fact, any standard that is likely to be widely agreed upon will be a weak
crypto standard. S/MIME with its 40 bit default key length is a prime
Meanwhile, the governments in just about any country with an Internet
connection, certainly the governments in the US, Australia, and the EC are
marching in lock step to implement global GAK. There is not a single
significant market in the western world in which GAK is not either being
proposed, studied by pro-GAK "working groups", or already implemented. We
might see GAK nearly world wide within two years. The question isn't if GAK
will happen but only when it will happen. The speed by which GAK will
become the law depends on a few factors, many of which are out of our
control. Primarily, that means number and severity of Reichstag Fires the
GAK proponents can make use of to push their cause.
The odds seem slim that we will win the race to the mythical fork in the
road at which point crypto regulations will no longer matter, because
strong crypto is too widely deployed.

Of course S/MIME will default to 40 bit RC-4 and carry the signatures outside the encryption envelope. There is little doubt in my mind that the pannel will find it much easier to support than PGP.

I agree. But it really doesn't matter. The goal of the governments is not
to stop people that are willing to operate a crypto program on blocks of
text. That goal would be impossible to achieve. The goal of the governments
is to ensure that once Joe Sixpack clicks "Encrypt Mail" in Netscape or MS
Mail, the resulting cyphertext can still be read, though not by Joe
himself. It is *because* PGP operated on blocks of text and did not provide
a decent API that Joe (and even Tim May) are still not encrypting the bulk
of their email.
PGP isn't being used, because it lacks the API. S/MIME doesn't lack the API
and is therefore being supported by all the major players.
Crypto should not be tied to specific browsers and mailers. Nor should it
be tied to a specific program such as PGP. That's why hooks and APIs are
crucial to gaining market acceptance.
Of course not. Nor do they want to. A little leakage around the edges is
fine, as long as the masses don't adopt strong crypto. And that is a given,
thanks to PGP's lack of modularity.
I am not just slamming PGP. It is not the only CP "friendly" software that
was implemented in an outdated, application-centric way. This was fine some
four years ago, when people were still using DA/Font Mover to install fonts
on their Mac, but it isn't today.
Today's realities of software development and customer expectations require
that secondary functionality (in this example, sending and receiving mail
is the primary functionality) such as encryption, message encoding, etc.
are completely transparent and fully integrate in the software that
provides the primary functionality. How many of you are still using
UUencode (the stand-alone program) when emailing someone a binary file? How
many of you are using the "Attach File" button in your mailer? How many
more people are sending binary files via email now that you can click
"Attach File" than did back when you had to use UUencode? I rest my case.

While it is true that there is a relatively small market for remailers and
therefore insufficient incentive to spend great efforts on developing
for-pay remailers, there is a relatively simple technical modification to
Ecash that might lower the development barrier to a level at which for-pay
remailers may be deployed.
Clearly, the task of designing a new remailer architecture as well as a
payment system suitable for use in such an architecture is prohibitive at
the current market size. If currently deployed remailer and payment systems
could be modified to interoperate, developing for-pay remailers would be
considerably easier.
Unfortunately, there are technical reasons that have kept the two main
contenders for building such a hybrid system, Mixmaster and Ecash, from
interoperating in a smooth fashion.
Mixmaster has certain constraints on the maximum number of bytes a
potential payment sting can have. [Note: the constraint is in the Mixmaster
header, it has nothing to do with total message size].
To stay within that limit, the client used to access the Ecash wallet would
have to be able to specify the exact denominations of coins to be used to
make a payment of a given amount. Neither DigiCash's current Ecash client,
nor the recently released official Ecash API allow for this level of
control over the composition of a payment.
When there is a fully working implementation of Ecash that allows the
detailed control required to create payment messages that Mixmaster can
incorporate in its messages, implementing for-pay remailers should be

Dear Security First customer:
With the release of Netscape Navigator 2.0, Netscape enhanced their
caching mechanism to improve the browser's performance.  As a result
of this enhancement, the Navigator was storing Security First username
and password information when entered in cleartext on a customer's
local hard drive in a file called fat.db.  Therefore, if a
knowledgeable and malicious person had access to a Security First
customer's computer, they could have potentially stolen that customer's
username and password.  To our knowledge, this vulnerability was NOT
exploited by anyone.
We were made aware of this fact in an e-mail to the bank from Lucky
Green, a frequent contributor to the cypherpunks mailing list.
Immediately upon learning of this situation, Five Paces engineers
worked closely with Netscape engineers and fixed the problem.  To

Of course these sites are in an ideal position to log their user's every
move. With so many users making all their http requests through a single
site, the commercial value of the information that could be gained by
logging traffic at the site is tremendous.
Only when a network of anonymizing sites is connected through something
like PipeNet and the users are either PipeNet nodes themselves, or at least
randomly use various PipeNet nodes for their http connections, does the
security of the user increase.
With only one hop, IMHO, the potential risk outweighs the potential
benefit. I'd advise against using such single-hop http anonymizers. YMMV.

o "Security Packages must be signed. Policy for signing is public and open."
I assume the packages must be signed by Sun. How much will it cost to have
a package signed? How do I obtain a copy of this "public and open" policy?
o "Exportable API. Exportable applications."
One code example shows performing a DES encryption. Another slide mentions
"Support for [...] RSA." This is exportable? What am I missing?

One possibility is that all crypto is done in hardware. The recent announcements by many hardware manufacturers that smartcard readers will be included in all their products (MS will put them into their keyboards) might get the necessary infrastructure deployed.
Of course, no crypto will work without the hardware token. The applications use signed code. Hardware tokens are only valid for a certain time. Making future mandatory upgrades to Fortezza, etc. a cinch.

@_subject: HP announcement 
That's my analysis as well. That, and we will see crypto strength based on the application. Credit card numbers get 3DES, email gets 40bit RC4.
The decision which type of crypto to use is not solely up to the user. If it was, a non-US user could just decide to turn on strong crypto. The Policy Token must therefore contain a field indicating GAK is "optional" or mandatory.
What does this mean? Policy tickets are served from central Policy
Servers. Foreigners only get servers that will turn GAK on by default. US
users get servers, run by an unspecified agency, that will initially send
tickets with a "GAK optional" value. This value can be changed to "GAK
mandatory" in times of national emergencies, suspected terrorist
activities, suspicious behavior, you know the drill.
Flip a central switch, and all crypto goes from "non-GAK" to "GAK". Which of course makes it GAK from the outset.

Sure. There are Nautilus and PGPFone. The problem is that software-only
solutions are unlikely to provide a sound quality that is acceptable for
everyday use over analog lines. At least not unless you have a very fast
machine and don't intend to use it for anything else than telephony. Here
is why: Computer telephony codecs are subject to a tradeoff amongst three main o Voice quality (you want to maximize this)
o Processing power required (you want to minimize this)
o Bandwidth (you definitely want to minimize this)
Imagine the three factors to form the dimensions of a cube. You can get
the choose two values, but not all three. Example: you can get good voice
quality on a machine with a (relatively) slow CPU, if you have a lot of
bandwidth. Or you can get good voice quality on a very fast machine with
little bandwidth. Of the three factors, band with is the most limiting. The best codec in the word on the fastest machine can't give you decent
voice quality on a very slow connection. So how much bandwidth do you need? An ISDN B-channel, which is designed to
carry one digital telephone conversation, is 64kbps. But a regular POTS
telephone, using an analog line, doesn't have nearly as much bandwidth to
work with. You should not expect an analog modem to link up at a speed of
more than 14.4kpbs. Some lines may link up at only 9600bps.  Forget about
the less than 10% of US phone lines that allow the use of 28.8kbps. You
can't rely on your customers to use your product only over such lines. The first problem is therefore to find a software codec that compresses your voice down to 14.4kbps. They exist, but they require a lot of computations and therefore a fast CPU.
But that's only half the problem. Next, you need to encrypt the data steam. The rule of thumb here is: the stronger the crypto, the more cycles you need. Since we are talking about strong crypto, such as 3DES, you will need _a lot_ of cycles.
Once you add the cycles needed by the codec and the cycles needed by the crypto, you will find that you, more likely than not, don't get enough cycles from your CPU. The obvious solution to this problem is to use a codec that uses lossier compression and therefore less cycles, resulting in lower speech quality.
Even after sacrificing voice quality, telephony is most likely the only task your computer will be able to do while you are on the phone. This may work for you, but it won't work for many others. After all, not
many people have a spare 200MHz Pentium sitting around that they don't need for anything else.
The alternative is to use dedicated hardware. Remember that a general
purpose CPU is just that: general purpose. If you want to use the box only
for one purpose, there is often a cheaper, better solution available in
special purpose hardware. For the price of the Pentium box, you can build
a much smaller bump-in-the-cord device that delivers great sound, over
slow links, *and* uses strong crypto.
Which is what Eric Blossom  did. And he did it extremely well, I'd like to add.
I don't want to discourage you. Try the software-only solutions and see if they work you. You can find them at

It was a good idea. It just is facing some very hard engineering challenges. Using software based voice encryption products may work for you. By all means, do give them a try. PGPfone has a codec for use with an ISDN or better. If you have such a fast line, the voice quality is fine. Note that a fast IP connection may or may not suffice. Here is why:
Other than bandwidth, the other essential property of the link is constant and preferably low delay. I did not mention this in my original tutorial, since this
1. We were assuming use over a regular POTS, which already has fairly constant delay.
2. There is nothing any codec can do to make up for variable delays.
The reason is simple. If the delay is not constant, such as if you are sending UDP packets over the Internet new problems arise. One packet may take 50ms and the next packet may take 250ms, if it doesn't just get lost along the way. Packets may also arrive out of sequence. One might think the answer to this is simply a large buffer at the receiving end. Make the buffer large enough, to be reasonably sure that the packets will all be there, say 500ms. Assuming no other delays, that would mean that you have a 1/2 second delay between the person saying a word and you hearing it. Multiply this by two, since the other side would have the same buffer, and you have 1 second delays. Too long for a conversation. And then there is echo cancellation. But I'll spare you this. ;-)

The recent posts about GPS made me research the state of the art of GPS receivers. Seems they are getting pretty good. Two pounds, sub-meter accuracy, attitude determination, all at altitudes up to 60,000 feet and speeds up to 1,000 nmph. But what really caught my eye was the fine print at the bottom of the spec sheet:
"Higher altitude and velocities up to 25,000 nautical miles-per-hour options are available in the U.S."
I gather from this that as long as you are in the US, you are welcome to use this technology for applications that require larger than 1,000 nmph Seems the software industry is not the only industry that's suffering from silly export control laws.

Public safety.
Sure. Firearms. The Gun Control Act of 1968 bans the importation of supposedly "cheap" firearms that can to this day (though this is about to change) legally be manufacturered and sold in the US. For the political novices, here is a brief explanation of the often overlooked cryptography/"munitions" connection.
A high level of firearms ownership in the population, similarly to a high penetration of crypto software, puts an upper boundary on what a government can do to its citizens. The first order of any government wishing to go beyond this border must therefore be to dramatically reduce the level of gun ownership (and crypto, but that is relatively new Consequently, one of the first laws the Fuhrer had passed was the Firearms Control Act of 1933. The USG, also intend on exceeding said boundary (to what degree remains to be seen) followed his lead in passing the Gun Control Act of 1968, copying much of the 1933 law, often verbatim. This should come as no surprise, given the fact that the author of the 1968 Act was working of a translation of the 1933 law that he requested from the Library of Congress.
Once the concept of gun control had been established, it could be expanded on in the future and has been so to this day.
What does all that have to do with crypto? It is the *same* issue. In the government's view, crypto is a danger to their future plans, just as firearms are. Do you think it is a coincidence that crypto is listed as a munition? Think about it for just a moment. Crypto is a weapon in the hands of the people. And that's what Cypherpunks is all about.
Starting from import restrictions, you will see restrictions on size of keys (=maximum rounds in the magazine, now set at 10, proposed to be lowered to six), who may own it (no felons, people convicted of certain misdemeanors), who may sell it and how it can be purchased (must provide identification, sales will be logged). I guess you can figure out the rest.

I don't know if Tim said that as well, but I certainly did. The government's move is ingenious.

Yes. What is good for the government and what is good for the people will always be opposite.

I agree that true key recovery for the corporate environment is often desirable. I do not believe that it will ever have to include an outside 'escow" agent.

While I am a peaceful, non-violent person, an ever increasing number of others feel differently. If the government continues on the course they are on - and requiring (never mind the 'voluntary') GAK is doing just that - there will be those who will feel that armed resistance is the only option left.

Below is a repost of the original PipeNet article from February, 1995. The author is Wei Dai.
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
A week ago I made a suggestion for a new protocol for untracibility,
but only got one response.  I'll try again, this time more
forcefully.  I'm not trying to convince anyone to implement this
(though of course you're welcome to!), but just to think about it and
give me feedback.
Why is another protocol needed?  Right now we have only two,
each of which has its own set of tradeoffs.  To summarize:
        Mix-Net (i.e., remailer-net): high latency, moderate bandwidth
                costs, and low complexity
        DC-Net: moderate latency, high bandwidth costs, and high complexity
While the DC-Net will probably never be widely used, the remailer-net
has a fair chance of one day
providing a way for many people to send e-mail that not even governments
can trace.  However, I don't think this is enough.  Efficient
social and business relationships require that people be able to
converse to each other in real time.  Cryptoanarchy will not come about
if people cannot do this anonymously.  How well can two pseudonymous
agents negotiate a contract if each message they send must be delayed
several hours?  The protocol I sugguested would have low latency, moderate
bandwidth costs, and moderate complexity.  It would be well suited for
people to interact anonymously in a textual environment.
Lance pointed out the chain cannot be built quickly.  This is not a problem
if servers connect to each other with relatively wide link-encrypted pipes
and multiplex your connection into these pipes.
In this system, latency would never be more than a few seconds, bandwidth
cost is N*100 cps (point to point), N being the number of links in your Implementation would probably be harder than remailers, but much easier
than DC-Nets.  The protocol would also provide both sender and receiver
untracibility without any need for broadcasting.
Wei Dai
P.S. I never gave a name for the protocol... let's call it Pipe-net.

Denmark's justice minister justice has called a summit to discuss a joint  Nordic campaign against the biker gangs whose violent confrontations are posing an increasing danger to the public
throught the region.
Bjorn Westh, who is said to be shocked and furious at the latest
violence which left 2 people dead and 19 ingured after a rocket attack in Copenhagen, will meet his cunterparts from Sweden,
Norway and Finland to consider strategies against the gangs.
A justice ministry spokeswoman said: "It will ve an exchange of ideas between the ministers. It's a very serious situation in Denmark
at the moment abd these levels of violence could easily spread to other parts of Scandanivia.  Westh is looking into the possibility
of a total ban on the gangs but his priority is to secure the
safety of civilians."
Westh's initiative follows a meeting on 7 Octobe bwtewen Danish
Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Tasmussen and Swedish Prime Minister
Goran Persson, who promised their countries would fight the bikers
Calls for concerted national and regional action against the escalating gang warfare have been mounting.  Only last week 1000

in Copenhagen's Norrebro district.  A few days later were awakened in the early morning by an anti-tank rocket exploding in the bikers'

After months of prevarication the Danes have resolved to take tough action against the gangs.
Parliament is this week rushing through legislation which will
prevent members of the feuding Hell's Angles and Banditos meeting at their clubhouses in populated areas, and a national task force has been set up to combat the gangs.
Commander Per Larsen, who is heading the new unit, said: "The new
legislation is good news for us and we are pleased with the initiatives
of the prime minuster and justiice ministers.  But we would like to
see parliament giving us further powers to bug and phone-tap suspects
and to search houses secretly."
The feud, which began in 1994, has claimed 9 lives and injured 50
people throughout the region.

Nope. It is a Cypherpunk loss.

Many PKIs will support the former type of key recovery. And for good reasons. Thanks to the brainwashers using the same term for GAK, it will now become impossible to tell from a basic description of a PKI if it supports GAK or not. Furthermore, those who oppose the latter type of key recovery (us!), will be pushed further into the fringe by the media now being able to mix up our arguments against GAK with arguing against true key recovery. [Do you notice the weird constructs I have to use to distinguish the two meanings? One of them being new...]

What's next? Thought escrow?
---- Forwarded Message from other list ------
Figured you might be interested in this.  I copied it from Nexus Oct/Nov 1996.
SOUL CATCHER IMPLANTS
British scientists are developing a concept for a computer chip which, when implanted into the skull behind the eye, will be able to
record a person's every life time thought ands sensation.
"This is the end of death," said Dr. Chris Winter of British Telecom's artificial-life team.  He predicts that within thirty years
it will be possible to relive other people's lives by playing back
their experiences on a computer.  "By combining this information with
a record of a person's genes, we could recreate a person physically,
emotionally and spiritually."
Dr Winter and his team of scientists at BT's Martlesham Heath Laboratories, near Ipswich, call the chip "the Soul Catcher."
British telecom would not divulge how much money it is investing in
the project, but Dr. Winter said it was taking "Soul Catcher 2025"
very seriously.  He confessed there were profound ethical
considerations, butr emphasised that BT was embarking on this line of
research so it could keep at the forefront of communications
Dr. Winter said "an implanted chip would be like an aircraft's black
box, and would enhance communications beyond current concepts.  "For
example, police would be able to use it to relive an attack, rape or
murder from the victims viewpoint, to help catch the criminal...  I
could even play back the smells, sounds and sighs of my holidays to
Other more frightening applications include downloading an older
person's experiences into a newborn baby by transplanting the chip.

@_subject: Eternity service proxies 
============================== START ==============================
Works for me.
This is true for some value of cheaper. The proxy framework provides
services to the proxylets. Therefore it is cheaper to write a proxylet than
it is to write a proxy. However, the advantages of using a proxy framework
to enable multiple local proxies are not limited to reducing the work
effort of the proxylet author. The framework also would provide
registration services, which are pretty much a requirement for dynamically
loadable proxylets to exist on a machine without requiring user intervention.
After all, the proxies have to operate in a certain order to be functional.
This order would be hard to achieve without the proxies knowing about each
other. And since the proxies almost by definition have no idea what is
happening on the other side of that socket (or however you want to
implement the proxy-to-proxy interface), somebody needs to watch over them
to make sure they get used in the right sequence.
To give an example of a machine with a moderate number of client side
proxies, you might have
1. A DNS resolver proxy that intercepts the *.eternity TLD's.
2. The actual Eternity proxy that builds the NNTP requests.
3. A crypto proxy that encrypts the NNTP requests between the localhost and
a suitable NNTP server.
4. An Onion Router/Pipe-net/jondo proxy that allows for anonymous access of
the NNTP server.
And that's just for the Eternity service. Add to this a POP/SMTP proxy that
automatically encrypts/decrypts all mail, an https proxy that beefs up 40
bit SSL to 128 bits, a proxy that provides for on the fly decryption of
webpages that are _stored_ encrypted, and before you know it you have ten
proxies on a machine that all have to be used in a specific order.
Ten proxies that have no way of knowing about each other. A proxy framework
soon becomes a requirement.
Sure. The user should never have to use special tools to access
information. That's the beauty of using proxies. You use a standard browser
as front end. All the rest is taken care of transparently by the proxies.

At a recent Cypherpunks meeting, I had a conversation with a person working

thousands of keys. Their strategy when faced with a subpoena is to hand
over n-m of the total n keys. (m << n) The other keys just can't be found.
After all, it is perfectly reasonable that a few keys out of several
thousand get lost. To quote: "those keys simply won't be subject to subpoena".
I do not know which type of information will be encrypted with said keys.
Of course, neither will others, since the data will remain encrypted...
Remember this the next time you hear some clueless idiot claim that
industry wants full key recovery. The last thing industry needs is access
to all their confidential information during discovery.

Of course there is another solution: legalize drugs. The reason why addicts
have to steal to support their habit is that the costs of narcotics have
been artificially inflated due to prohibition. Medical cocaine wholesales
at about $0.50 per gramm. Heroin should be in the same price range. Nobody
would have to steal to come up with a few dollars a day.
As ususal, the government created the problem and then proudly comes up
with a solution involving even more government. As the case is in
Switzerland. First they make it too expensive to buy and then they discover
they have to give it away to reduce the negative consequences of a
situation they created in the first place.

I must agree with Alex on this one. Why a person became addicted is
irrelevant. They are addicted and the question for the rest of us must
become "how can we minimize the impact their addiction has on us". It has
been shown that people usually grow out of Heroin addiction after time. The
non-black market cost of their addiction is probably less than a dollar per
day. The cost they impose on society when having to support their habit
through the black market is much higher. Even without involving government,
it would be trivial to raise the funds from donations to keep all addicts
supplied with their drugs until such time that they are capable to give up
the drugs entirely.
BTW, I just found out that William S. Burroughs died. No, he didn't grow
out of it an remained an Heroin addict until his death of old age. He must
have been well into his 80's. And he was no burden on society. The
royalties from his  works could have fed even the most severe addiction.
His writings influenced me in a big way during my youth. [This may be
off-topic, but if there is any list on which people might care about the
death a revolutionary like Burroughs, it is Cypherpunks].

I agree. A real life crack of DES can almost always assume a know plain

I have been running the distributed prime search software (see my .sig) for
about two months now. [2^1398269-1 is prime!] If you haven't tried this
software, I'd urge you to do so now. Not only because it might make you
famous, but because it will give you some ideas how a distributed DES crack
might work.
I always liked the screen saver idea, but a crack using screen savers only
works while the screen saver is active. The mersenne prime program runs on
the lowest priority thread under Win95/NT/Linux. It works even while you
are working, using all the idle cycles it can find, while at the same time
having no effect at all on any of the work you do. Install it and forget
about it. It's better than a screen saver.

down to let other lists pick up the various parts of the discussion. Hard
core crypto can go to Coderpunks, crypto and politics can go to
Cryptography. The drivel and whining can go to hell. I am willing to give
the moderation experiment a chance. If it doesn't work, I will advocate
shutting down the list.
As with every TAZ that stays up for too long, Cypherpunks eventually got
infested by vermin. Vulis, aga, et al. come to mind. In my experience, once
that happens there is only one solution: take down the TAZ and start over
somewhere else. The problem is always the same: the belief that "anarchy"
means that you have to tolerate people shitting on everybody's floor.
Anarchy means no such thing.

@_subject: Airport security [no such thing] 
I recently took a domestic flight from the Oakland, CA airport. While
waiting for the airplane, I spent some time observing the security measures
at the X-ray machine.
As most readers probably know, laptops are often subject to manual
scrutiny. From my non-representative sample, about four out of five tote
bags clearly containing laptops will be manually searched. Typically, the
attendant requires that the laptop is powered up. In none of the 20+ manual
searches I witnessed did the security personnel wait past the RAM check
before clearing the passenger. I could not help but contemplate how much of
the insides of the laptop could be replaced while still obtaining an
identical display.
Then came the big one: A man wearing a beer truck driver uniform approached
the checkpoint. On his hand truck were two kegs of beer. For those
unfamiliar with such objects, a keg of beer is a cylindrical stainless
steel container, about 1.5 feet tall with about 1 foot diameter.
I was wondering what the procedure for handling these rather large steel
containers would be.  Would they be X-rayed? How much shielding would the
steel provide for the contents? Much to my surprise, the man did not
approach the X-ray machine. Instead, he went straight for the "exit only"
walkway. The guard posted there to make sure that nobody would enter
through the exit gave the fellow only a cursory glance as he entered the
"secure" area unchallenged.
I was flabbergasted. They let a man with two *large steel containers* enter
unchecked? No asking for ID, no X-ray? I struck up a conversation with the
beer truck driver. I asked him why the kegs did not get X-rayed. He looked
at me with an expression of utter lack of understanding and answered: "They
are too heavy to be put on the [conveyor] belt."
Right... We wouldn't want to have these 50 pound steel barrels jam the
X-ray machine.

The list is currently discussing an ActiveX Ecash control. With -lucre, you no longer need to sign up with an issuer. Assuming an ActiveX control, the client software installs itself.

It tells us that the US government has found yet another sucker to support
their failed policy of bait and switch. VeriSign, just as AT&T and National
Semiconductor have discovered in the past, will discover soon that the
revenue generated by "playing ball" isn't nearly as large as promised. [How
many Clipper phones and Fortezza iPower cards were sold? Total?] In fact,
it the revenue may well prove to be in the negative digits.
Here is the straight dope on the VeriSign/MSFT/NSCP/USG deal:
If you are
1. A non US-bank (the feds decide what constitutes a bank) and promise to
be nice or
2. A US corporation with a server inside the US and thereby subject to
subpoena of all records
then VeriSign will issue you a special cert, subject to veto by the feds,
that will enable exportable Netscape and Microsoft browsers to connect to
your site with 128 bit SSL.
The cert is typically valid for a year, but is subject to revocation at any
time by VeriSign upon the USG's request. Such revocation or refusal to
issue a new cert after the first year of operation will leave the webserver
operator with a server that is no longer able to encrypt communications to
their customers in any meaningful way, thereby effectively shutting down
Internet based operations of the company unfortunate enough to invest in
such a flawed solution.
In other words, the USG now permits you to use strong crypto in web based
communications with your international customers if you agree to play by
the USG's rules and allow the feds to install a MASTER-OFF switch in the
heart of your business. What is most amusing from the government's
perspective is that once the USG flips the switch, it will be VeriSign,
Microsoft, and Netscape that take the heat for selling their customers such
a flawed solution.

@_subject: Verisign gets export approval 
True, the certs themselves are not covered by the export controls. But we
aren't talking about export law. We are talking about a four way
contract between Netscape, Microsoft, VeriSign, and the US government. Under that contract:
o VeriSign will only issue Global ID certs to US
companies with all their servers located in the US and overseas banks with
servers abroad that play by the USG's rules. Once the USG no longer approves
of the participants using strong crypto with their customers, VeriSign
will revoke the cert, disabling secure communications, and thereby severely
damaging, if not destroying, the business of the party unfortunate enough
to have relied on such a cert for their livelyhood. o Netscape and Microsoft get a blanket approval to ship their servers to non-US banks that meet the USG's criteria.
o Netscape and Microsoft also receive approval to export browsers that can use strong crypto *exclusively* with sites the USG and VeriSign approve of.
o The USG no longer has to waste time handling export applications it
doesn't mind approving anyway, such as those for US-friendly foreign banks.
And the USG no longer has to listen to US companies complain because they
are unable to provide their non-US customers with secure access to the sever located in the US.
Lastly, and most importantly, every purchaser of a VeriSign Global ID cert
allows the USG and VeriSign to install a MASTER-OFF switch in the heart of
their business. I feel sorry for the poor suckers that will lose home and hearth after subscribing to this fatally flawed solution.

[Tom, I am glad that your are adding your voice to this tread].
It is true that Communicator does not presently pull CRL's. However, an X.509 based application probably should pull the CRL, or at least verify that a cert about to be relied upon has not in fact been revoked by looking for a match in the CRL. It stands to reason that Communicator will at one point add this, IMHO proper, feature.
I also would like to mention the reader that yesterday's release of MSIE 4.0b2 *does* have the ability to check CRL's.
Even if Communicator would never check CRL's, not even in the future, the
mere fact that the Global ID cert have only a one year lifetime means anyone relying on Global ID can be held hostage by threatening to refuse to renew their cert. The reader may not be aware that unlike other certs, the Global ID certs are *only* issued by VeriSign. You can not go to a non-US CA and obtain such a cert. [Which of course would defy the whole purpose of this rather slick deal :-]
Unless VeriSign includes in the price of the Global ID cert a bond that will compensate the buyer of a Global ID based commerce system for any and all future losses caused by VeriSign either revoking or refusing to renew a cert (fat chance), anyone basing their strategy on having such a cert is at risk of losing their business.

Nothing wrong with releasing a GNU browser, but you will find it difficult

consumers will stick with Communicator and MSIE.
The Net would be considerably safer if Netscape and others would be allowed
to do as they please. Unfortunately, export laws are a reality and Netscape
and Microsoft do what they can to bring strong crypto to as many people as
possible without ending up in jail. My posts on this topic should not be
taken as bashing these software vendors for attempting to make their
products available to a larger number of customers. I certainly do not
question the integrity of people such as Tom Weinstein who have worked hard
to make the best of a shitty situation. A situation they did not create.
[That questionable honor goes to the USG].
I merely question the wisdom to rely on a solution that can be disabled at
any time, for any reason, or no reason at all, by a party outside your
company simply by revoking a single cert. One should not make one's fate
subject to the future whim of a third party.

So let us turn to the more relevant question: is it better for such bill to

years from now", but I feel that it not nearly as obvious as it seems and
in fact may even not be correct.
Ten years and a few Sarin attacks on American subways and other Reichstag
Fires later, such a bill will pass with the full backing of Joe Sixpack and

[The following post has zero crypto relevance.]
We all have heard much rhetoric concerning the Internet enabling the

potential sellers would not be able to reach a sufficient number of
potential buyers to make production of a good profitable.
But how many instances such newly created markets are you aware of? Well, I
discovered a rather sweet example.
You really like M&M's. You know: the round chocolate candy that melt in
your mouth, not in your hand. The only problem is, you don't like the
standard colors. You would much rather have all blue M&M's or, better yet,
a bag containing only teal and light pink. Since the market for teal or
light pink M&M's is marginal, the maker of M&M's does not include these
colors in the bags one can purchase at nearest corner store. What to do?
Voil�, the Internet to the rescue. Mars, the worldwide candy powerhouse and
manufacturer of M&M's, decided to tap this newly possible business
opportunity by offering custom colored M&M's through their webpage at
A Shockwave applet allows you to combine your favorite colors and order the
candy mix of your choice. Finally, teal M&M's are yours to indulge.

Let us assume that it is unethical to force children to participate  in the
production of child pornography. (For the benefit of Kent and the more
ignorant people on this list, I will state that I firmly believe this to be
true, despite the fact that doing so should be irrelevant for the argument.)
Furthermore, let us assume that there are a number of individuals who enjoy
looking at hard core child pornography.
The question then is: does going after the distributors provide a benefit
to the children being (potentially) used for such pictures?
The answer is clearly no. By limiting the distribution of an individual
picture, you increase the total number of pictures required to satisfy
market demand. That means more children will be required to meet demand.
Thus, by going after the distributors, Se7en causes more children to be
violated by child pornographers.
The only question that remains is: how can he live with this?

Given that a good number of people on this list live in CA, this might be
of interest to you. It certainly was to me. PacBell is selling flat rate 2B
ISDN Internet access at $50/month. Plus the regular home ISDN fees, but
this is still much cheaper than what I paid before. You might want to think
hard before you buy at new 56k modem that in all likelihood won't be able
to give you 56k anyway. And no analog modem will ever give you 128kbps.
Analog lines aren't made for data. They aren't particularly good for data.
That's why ISDN was designed. It didn't take off until recently, since it
was priced for business and business decided they didn't need it for
various reasons. But at these prices, you'd have to be a starving student
or nuts not to get it at home.

This is certainly true. I lived in cities most of my life and encountered a
good number of sellers of various illegal merchandise. [On 6th Street in
San Francisco, everything from crack to counterfeit subway passes is on
sale. On SSI payday, the dealers line up at 8 am right across from the
check cashing place. This is taking place two blocks away from the main
police station, the municipal court, and the county jail. The dealers
conduct their business openly in plain sight of anyone walking to the
nearby subway station. Same for the consumers smoking glass pipes in the
alley half a block away. All of this is funded by your tax dollars.]
Neither party seems to think they will be caught.
Medical cocaine wholesales in the US for $0.50 per gramm. I am told that
"street" cocaine with <50% active ingredient sells for about $50 a gramm.
That's two orders of magnitude difference between production cost and
selling price. No wonder that some of the smarter youths, the one's that
can keep track of money and understand business, choose careers as drug
dealers. What other good gives you similar profit margins? [I believe they
are missguided, but this must be hard to understand if you are 16 and can

As to the last part of the sentence, who' rights, exactly, were violated
when a pre-existing picture was scanned and posted? I assume you could say
that the child's rights were violated since it didn't sign a release. What
if its legal guardian agreed to the posting of the immage? I concur that a
child's legal guardian can not validly agree to the child being subjected
to the deranged treatment you describe, but I fail to see how the mere act
of scanning and posting the pictures is any different than scanning and
posting any other picture. Assuming the person scanning and posting is not

JavaSoft has moved into the right direction. Their JECF is largely
capabilities based and in fact, Java security in general in moving towards
capabilities. That won't help you against attacks via the underlying
insecure OS, such as Windows 95/NT, MacOS, or UN*X which the typical user
will be running, but it is miles ahead of the initial sandbox model.
I was a talk by Norm that made me see the light. Secure computing requires
capabilities. And there is anecdotal evidence that it was Norm who
indirectly pointed JavaSoft to the solution to their leaking sandbox problem.
Time for my usual plug: if you are unfamiliar with capabilities based
operating systems or don't know why they are the only currently available
solution to a whole host of computer security problems, do a search for
"KeyKOS". It should get you started.

I usually don't reply to these kind of posts, but since you have mentioned

and tried.
People won't use crypto unless it is either transparent, meaning put there

inconsequential when the objective is bringing crypto to the masses.

The reason for the lack of "refined and reviewed" code is simple. Writing
such  code is difficult and time consuming. Anybody on this list capable of
writing it probably has a 10+ hours daytime job. It is often hard to donate
the effort required into producing either a freeware system or a system
that has a shaky business model at best. Yes, the original code for type I
remailers was written in a few days. Their security is accordingly low,
interfaces were almost non-existent.
The type of software you seem to be interested in requires more than just a
single individual dedicating a few evenings to it. It requires entire
software development teams. That takes the development out of the realm of
guerilla programming and into commercial efforts. As PGP, Inc. can attest,
making money of strong crypto can be hard. That further limits the number
of players willing to dedicate time to such an effort.
While I would have to agree that FC'97 was a very worthwhile event from the
human networking perspective, I am confused by your claim that the
"toolkits"  lack the basics you need. I assume you are talking about
routines in crypto libraries here. What routines do you need that aren't in
the crypto libs available? I am not claiming that crypto libs have all the
routines one might possibly need, but I would be surprised if they didn't
have the routines you need. Perhaps it would help if you would explain what
you are looking for.
Furthermore, crypto libraries are not meant to address interface design.
The interface design is up to the application developer.
Somehow I doubt they will be developed anytime soon. Only a very small
fraction   of remailer users wants to hide the fact that they are using
remailers and not also hide the fact that they are using crypto at all.
If you only want to hide remailer use,  but not crypto use, a Pipe-net like
system should suit you fine.
I agree keylengths are an issue. An even larger issue are the properties of
ciphers. We don't know that breaking RSA is as difficult as factoring. We
just hope it is. And we definitely don't know that factoring can not be
done in polynomial time. Not to mention that we don't even know if P != NP.
Not wanting to split hairs, but 3DES is 168 bits. But it is about twice as
strong as DES, so the effective keylength does not exceed 128 bits. Still, there is good reason why so few of the many ciphers out there are
actually being used for the high security applications. No cipher has been
as thoroughly analyzed as DES. And while 3DES is often called slow (which
is irrelevant unless you have to encrypt large amounts of data), it is
generally considered secure. If you need better than 3DES, you want larger
keylength while retaining the security of using a well analyzed cipher. I
am not aware of any such cipher today. Perhaps that's why it is used so
little. :-)
I disagree. Just because Cypherpunks have not announced the releases of a
finished product, tremendous progress has been made this year alone. And we
have found new allies, such as the Onion Router team from Navy Research Lab
and the CROWDS team from AT&T.
Sure, their systems are far from perfect and require further development.
Which is why several Cypherpunks, myself included, have been busy getting
the teams up to speed, teaching them about attack methods, explaining to
them why certain attacks they discounted as unlikely are actually easy to
pull off, and generally advising these non-CP subscribers with very CP
projects about modifications that must be made to the software before it
will see widespread deployment. Understand that NRL has three scientists
working on Onion Routers a  significant part of their time. With full
funding. This is the kind of commitment it takes to make the more advanced
systems a reality. A volunteer effort is considerably less likely to be
able to come up with the resources for the many projects that need design
and implementation.
Other Cypherpunks have been busy working on advanced systems, but this
stuff takes time. Writing a crypto library is comparatively easy. If your
DES code gives the right results for a given IV, the code works. Taking
that DES code and some RSA code and turning it into an Onion Router is a
whole different challenge. And any mistakes you make are far less obvious.
No offense, but Adam's "Eternity" system doesn't come close to Ross
Anderson's original design. It is a fun weekend hack, but calling it the
Eternity Service is a very unfortunate choice of words. It isn't any more
Ross Anderson's Eternity Service than type I remailers are Chaumian mixes.
And how do you feed the base station? I believe the solution to permanent
servers is more likely to come from the IETF's mobile IP efforts (again a
project that far exceeds what a few Cypherpunks can do) and from anonymous
server designs such as recently proposed by the usual suspects and others
who wish to remain anonymous.
Clandestine anything, almost by definition, will never reach the entire
population, but only those that are willing to go out and seek it. [If it
was openly available, it wouldn't be clandestine.]
PGP became as popular as it did because it could be used with zero
investment by any two parties, requiring only minimum connectivity. Truly
secure net anonymizers will need, at least at the backbone level, multiple
dedicated machines with fat 24/7 Internet connections in multiple
jurisdictions.  That's a significant investment. Such sites are not going
to become a reality out of the goodness of somebody's heart. Even in the
unlikely event that somebody has the time to write all the code for free.

Unfortunately, Schneier doesn't do a very good job at discussing the
strength of 3DES. This probably is to be expected, since there is no fixed
effective keylength of 3DES and a more detailed discussion would likely
exceed the format of Applied Cryptography. The work factor of breaking 3DES
depends on the number of known plaintexts. At best, the effective keylength
is 112 bits. At worst (this is an unlikely, perhaps unrealistic worst) the
effective keylength is ~90 bits. Contrast this with DESX, which has been
proven to be twice as hard as DES, therefore having an effective keylength
of 112 bits.
It costs lots to develop a cipher with a larger keyspace that has a known,
or reasonably assumed, work factor of higher than 112 bits. Again, it takes
years to cryptanalyze a new cipher.
It isn't software designers that are restraining more secure
implementations. The software designers don't have any better algorithms to
work with because the theorists haven't agreed on anything better yet.

PGP crypto approved for export
By Tim Clark and Alex Lash
May 28, 1997, 7 p.m. PTThe U.S. government has granted an encryption export license to one of the biggest thorns in its side.
Pretty Good Privacy says it has won approval to export strong encryption technology overseas. The license allows PGP to export technology up to 128 bits; the government's regular licenses only allow up to 56 bits. To date, the government has only approved 128-bit encryption exports for technology that protects financial transactions but PGP technology can encrypt any kind of digital communication.
PGP was founded by cryptographer Phil Zimmermann. Zimmerman became something of a cause celebre when he posted his PGP technology on the Net in defiance of laws prohibiting international distribution of encryption technology. Zimmermann came close to going to jail before the government dropped its case against him.
The company said tonight that it counts more than half of Fortune 100 companies use its email software.
PGP still has another old foe to worry about. Encryption software giant RSA Data Security earlier this month filed a patent infringement lawsuit against PGP. The suit alleged that PGP is unlawfully using RSA technology licensed to Lemcom before its merger with PGP in 1996. PGP officials say RSA's claims are without merit.

I am somewhat surprised that you would make this claim, given that you must
have researched the situation in Europe for your article.
European style Privacy Commissioners solely limit the ability of _private_
entities to keep databases. They do not limit the ability of public
entities to keep databases. Sure, when a European government wants to bring
a new Big Brother database online, the Privacy Commissioner has to sign off
on the plan. This is typically a rubber stamp approval. Even worse, the
Privacy Commissioner rubber stamping the plan usually ends discussion,
since the government now can claim that their database is harmless because
the Privacy Commissioner has approved it.
German "dragnet investigations" and "pattern investigations" come to mind.
The German BKA (the equivalent of the FBI) keeps a giant database that
correlates "suspicious" behavior. Paying your utilities bills in cash
(unusual in GIRO-happy Germany) gets you points. If the person on the bill
isn't registered with the police at the address on the bill you get more
points. Paying your rent in cash gets you points. If they don't have a
social security record for you, more points yet. There are many other
criteria that will get you points.
If you collect enough points, the feds come by to interrogate you. Yes, the
Privacy Commissioner approved this "pattern investigation". In the interest
of space, I will spare the list what "dragnet investigation" entails.
It appears naive to claim that GAK could not happen under a Privacy
Commissioner. It could and it will.

proposals and I am not convinced that said proposals are less intrusive.
IMO the vast majority of the proposals I saw are more intrusive. One
subscriber even argued, make that screamed, that PGP 5.5 was evil because
it didn't automatically cc: the email to the corporate recovery agent. The
mind boggles.

Sometimes these guys can still surprise even me. That statement below is about as blatant as it gets:
There are a number of ways that that could be
implemented, but what we believe we need as a minimum
is a feature implemented and designed by the
manufacturers of the products and services here that
will allow law enforcement to have an immediate lawful
decryption of the communications in transit or the
stored data.  That could be done in a mandatory
manner.  It could be done in an involuntary manner.
But the key is that we have the ability.
Let me get this straight: they need *as a minimum* instant access to all cleartext. So what is the "more than minimum" they truly desire?
And the two alternatives Freeh proposes to obtain this *minimum* are either "mandatory" or "involuntary". What a choice!

Finding a judge to sign an order to decrypt the email of a suspected child
pornographer/drug dealer will take all of 30 minutes. I don't think a 30
minute delay will be of any consequence to the government's agenda. Not to
mention that Freeh lied to Congress when he claimed that they would always
use a court order. Even today, court orders are not always required for
wiretaps. This will be no different for future "mandatory" or "involuntary"
[BTW, does anybody here have any idea why Freeh might stated that he
preferred "mandatory" GAK over "involutary" GAK? Just curious...]

Of course, requiring GAK is more like requiring a remote kill switch in the

As signs in any liquor store have been informing tobacco customers for
months, new FDA regulations require stores to check the ID of any tobacco
customer under 25. This despite the fact that you are legally allowed to
purchase tobacco products at age 18. If the store fails to check the ID of
a person legally permitted to conduct the purchase but is under age 25, the
store faces hefty fines.
This is of course just another extension of the "requiring ID for
everything" long-term goal of the government. Tim recently nicely recapped
some of the transponder implant issues our society will soon face. "No

Actually, some recent FedEx packages I sent to Europe took about that long.
Add   to that the overhead of going to the mailbox and putting it up for

That depends. Some printed matter I sent to Europe not too long ago arrived
with a tag stating that diversion to certain countries would be in
violation of US export laws. I am not 100% certain, but I do not recall
that tag being on the box when it was shipped from the mailbox place. Which
suggests that somebody along the way opened the package and inspected its
contents.  When asking FedEx about this, the clerk assured me that it was
routine for US customs to inspect outgoing packages. The clerk seemed quite
confused that I was unaware of this fact.
I strongly suspect that if some Cyphercriminals were to aid in exporting
the information contained on that CDROM, they would use electronic means. I
may be wrong.
OK, I'll offer a prize: $10 in Ecash to the person that best predicts the
time it will take to export the entire contents of the Dr. Dobbs crypto CD.
The time span of interest is the average of the time during which the first
three US purchasers stating they received the CD and the time its contents
are received by a European or Asian crypto archive as determined by its

received their CD, I will use the time at which I received my CD. I am the

these wants due to propaganda is irrelevant. Congress simply reflects the
will of the People. If you doubt this fact, just conduct a poll that asks
the following question:
"Should suspected nuclear terrorists and child molesters be allowed to
engage in their activities unchallenged OR should the government be enabled

There are several fallacies in this paragraph. I'll address two of them.
First, you assume that terrorist actions are bad for the State. That is
incorrect. Terroism, unless widely supported by the population, is of great
benefit to the State. It helps to speed the passing of restrictive
legislation. If you doubt this, please do some research on the laws passed
in response to Oklahoma City in the US and the relevant laws passed
throughout the EU during the late seventies and early eighties.
Second, you assume that it would become widely know that the incriminating
message was missed by the monitors. This is also incorrect, unless the
monitors themselves choose to reveal the fact to support their future
requests for increased monitoring capablities.
The lack of positive identification of all participants on the Internet is
a displeasing hole to the surveillance state. Only an Internet driver

@_subject: DigiCash Update, part II 
As some of you may be aware of, I am involved with an effort to
acquire DigiCash. Allow me therefore to suggest that now is not a good
time to attempt to purchase a patent license directly from DigiCash.
You would most likely be paying too much.
DigiCash has for months now attempted to find a buyer for the
company's assets. Due to the expectations on the value of the assets, and
differences between this and the offers they've received, the board has
turned down these offers, including the first offer by my group. Ultimately,
differences between some of the high expectations the board has, and
the actual offers they are receiving will be worked out between higher
offers and lower expectations. Until then, DigiCash operates on a
post-bankruptcy filing bridge loan. This loan won't last forever.
Ultimately, DigiCash will be sold. But nobody wants to wait forever.
Not you, not me, not the DigiCash board. The faster DigiCash gets sold
to our group, the faster the technology will become available to all
interested parties under low cost (and in many cases free) licensing
terms. Even if DigiCash should now be willing to sell licenses to
generate cash flow or reorganize in some new plan and forestall the
inevitable sales of assets a little bit longer, the current DigiCash
is unlikely to make the licenses available for as low of a cost as our
group will make them available after an acquisition of DigiCash.
We are in a position to offer potentially significant cost
minimization to any prospective licensee of DigiCash IP. With every
additional party committing to our effort, we can reduce the cost per
license. Scott of course would be amiss of his fiduciary duty would he
not attempt to maximize the financial return to DigiCash. We have no
such constraint.   I have a lot of respect for Scott and he is trying
to do what is best for the DigiCash shareholders and debtholders (As
he should).   We on the other hand are more focused on what is best for
the technology, to ensure it is deployed widely and in all it's
various potential uses.
The more serious parties join our effort, the faster will we be able
to make another bid and the faster the DigiCash board will review and
hopefully approve our next offer. Ultimately, everybody will be happy.
The creditors will be happy since they get their money, the current
executive group at DigiCash will be happy to move on having
successfully found a palatable deal, and the licensees will be happy,
since they will be able to obtain the IP and options for support and
technology development instead of being held in limbo with the present
DigiCash situation. And of course the developer community will be
happy, since the patents will be available to all, not just to the few
to which DigiCash might license the patents to improve their
unfortunate cash flow situation. This broad availability will allow
the market to validate the technology. No single player, or even small
group of players, can make eCash a success. Only an aggressive push by
many large, small and medium sized players who are all deploying eCash
and blinded private payment systems can.
This is one of the many reasons our group has the support of several
of the larger banks in the world, banking software/EDI vendors, credit
card clearing houses, personal financial/cryptography software
vendors, global media corporations, and other players that are
required to make eCash and other DigiCash IP derived technologies
Feel free to contact DigiCash directly if you must.   We certainly
encourage people who are interested in exclusive ownership of the
DigiCash IP, and are not interested in opening up the patents or
technology to deal directly with them since this is contrary to our
goal.   But if you are interested in any one part, one use or
application or even in all of the parts in a non-exclusive way please
make sure to email me first as I believe it will benefit everyone for
a lot less money.

[Coderpunks distribution removed]
I've heard a number of descriptions of the history of Apache-SSL-US (later
Stronghold) over the years, but Anon's version of history is not supported
by the facts.
First of all, Stronghold does not use a line of Ben's Apache-SSL code.
Hasn't for years. C2Net switched to the Sioux code base when they acquired
Sioux from Thawte. Which was a long time ago.
[Out of courtesy, I won't comment on C2Net's present difficulties other than
that they have little to do with mod_ssl].
Fast forward a few years. Ralph releases mod_ssl, by all accounts a very
well done SSL integration with Apache. mod_ssl implements some much overdue
cleanups that for whatever reasons never made it into Ben's Apache-SSL. I
don't know if C2Net is moving to use mod_ssl, but given the quality of the
module, I would not be surprised. Either way, mod_ssl is under BSD-style
license and C2Net is free to use mod_ssl in their commercial products.
Meanwhile, troubles developed in SSLeay land. The entire recent discussion
about OpenSSL on the various lists must be rather confusing if one doesn't
know the current status of SSLeay. [Hint: it would be really nice if this
finally was announced by those who should be doing the announcement. Which
isn't me].
Suffice to say that it is unlikely in the extreme that SSLeay or the SSLapps
will continue to be maintained by their original development team, Eric
Young and Tim Hudson. Rather than complain about this turn of events, let's
all thank Eric and Tim for the awesome work they performed for cryptographic
freedom and the Internet community. Big thanks guys! Those that feel
inclined to complain about the situation are strongly encouraged to write an
open source software implementation of the importance, complexity, and size
of SSLeay prior to voicing their complaints.
With future SSLeay development in limbo, somebody needs to ensure continued
development. Unfortunately, the launch of such a framework was overshadowed
by Sameer and Ben slugging out their personal differences on mailing lists.
It was silly and downright rude for anyone to announce the formation of such
a group before first giving the usual suspects a courtesy heads-up. But this
too will hopefully be water under the bridge before long (just please
remember it for the next time). Meanwhile, the best of wishes for the

Of course source availablility aids greatly in evaluating the overall security of software. However, Jim was correct in pointing out that employed in crypto component freeware is counterproductive. May companies will not be able to source contaminated by GNU-style licensing restrictions. Consequently, alternatives would be found. Some of those alternatives, include using no crypto at all or using crypto written by somebody that does not understand crytography. Hardly the outcome a Cypherpunk would desire.
We should all thank Eric for making SSLeay available under a BSD-style license. The world probably would have half as many internationally available strong cryptographic products had Eric used GPL.
The bottom line is that GNU-licensing is more restrictive than BSD/SSLeay-style licensing. Hence identical freeware will see less deployment under GNU than under BSD.
Cyphpunks believe that more strong crypto is better.
The conclusion in the GNU vs. BSD/SSLeay/etc. license debate should be clear.

If any of the Bay Area Cypherpunks here know of somebody or are themselves
knowledgeable in SCSI controller firmware or design, PCI boards, or fast
embedded systems crypto, please get in touch with me for a chat.

@_subject: ArcotSign (was Re: Does security depend on hardware?) 
I am somewhat puzzled by your response. Do you assert that a software based
solution, executed on a general purpose CPU under a general purpose OS, can
afford the same protection of whatever the secret in question may be as a
hardware token, such as a smartcard? A hardware token lacking the very API
to extract the secret through software based attacks?
If so, could you please share with us the revolutionary breakthrough in
computer science that negates the effect of decompilers and runtime
debuggers on Arcot's software?
Furthermore, how do you consolidate the claim on Arcot's website that
"ArcotSignTM [...] offers [hardware solution] tamper resistance in software"
with the statement by Arcot's very own cryptographic advisor, Bruce
Schneier, that "Of course. It's less secure than hardware solutions".
Perhaps I have worked in this industry for too long to fully adjust to the
novel genius displayed in "virtual one-time pads", "virtual smartcards", and
"virtual security".
