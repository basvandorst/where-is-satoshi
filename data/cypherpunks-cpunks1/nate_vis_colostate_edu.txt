@_subject: "Big Brother Inside" logo 
I have just now finished my "Big Brother Inside" logo.  Here is a recap:
The logo was scanned in as 600dpi line-art on a Microtech scanner (logo
from an ad in Time mag.).  I then used Adobe Photoshop to change the size
to 8.667" wide and 8" tall, at 300 dpi.  At this size, I messed with the letters, and smoothed out all the aliasing bumbs that the scanner made.
Short story:  The logo is REALLY cool.  I have a 8.667" by 8" logo and a 2" by 1.8" version (for stickers) - I envision the larger one
being for T-shirts...  I am investigating having Tshirts made with
the logo on the front and a blurb about not using the Clipper (or is
it Skipjack?) chips.  Does anyone have any good ideas for what to put on the back?  so far I have this:
                     (BIG LETTERS HERE)
                     Fight the Clipper.
(Smaller letters)
   Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!     (with Tim's permission, assuming he grants it)

I am sorry for this, but I am absolutely financially strapped now.
BTW, the images names started with "BigBro" -= and if you want,
you can strip off the "Image Edited by Nate Sammons" line I dropped in the lower right corner of the large images (it was in,

Is there anyone out there thinking that in several years all of us will
be looking back on this (The Detweiler fiasco) and remarking on it
as being something of a ground-breaking flame war that would have
repercussions throughout cyberspace and the future?  I was thinking this
today, while I was working away in my Lab.  "What a funny thought!", I thought.  Someday, in the near future, all of us will be able to say
that we were part of a major breakthrough in Cyberspacial history,
the first (I am afraid it will be the first of many) McCarthy-type
witch hunts (maybe in the future we'll be accused by "legitimate" government agencies of being the Medusas behind many Tenticles,
hunted, wrongly, like dogs).

pay some service to scrounge up all the USENET posting you have made for
the last, say, 10 years, and run them through a filter to get a feel for
the nature of the posts (assuming you were too prolific to have the job-hunters read _al_ of your posts).
This really scared me, so I think I will start making more frequent
use of the remailers in the future.

writes Jordan Hayes:
I agree.  The signal to noise is high, but grep is fast and, if you were
determined many layers of filtering could be added to inhance the
"resolution" of the search.  My concern is that it is becoming more and more common for people to "grow up" on the net, many people I know of started quite young, and
a determined opponent (as I'll call the snooper) could, concieveably
search your entire posting history.
Lets say that the (kind, benevolant, of course) Government is considering
indicting you on charges of conspiracy to do something illegal, but are unsure if there is enough evidence to connect you to the crime.  Or, let's say that they believe you have had a long-involved role in inciting the breaking of a law.  They (the government, remember -- big computers, nearly unlimited people and time) could look for anything relating you to inciting or bacoming involved in things that could even
be construde as close to illegal.
Bottom line is that we need to watch our backs, but I don't want to lapse

I set PAGER to "pgp -m" (with the full path, of course) in my .mailrc,

This seems to work fine, since it leaves the message encrypted and all

@_subject: PGPcompose, a mail wrapper 
I have been looking for a good mailer lately, or at least
a mail wrapper to sign and encrypt my mail easily.  I was
not completely satisfied with the wrappers that I could find, and especially since they mostly need perl.  So,
in a fit of frustration, I did what any good CypherPunk
would do: I wrote one.  It is called "PGPcompose" and if you invoke it with a username, it will prompt for the subject, open vi for editing, then ask you if you want
to sign the message, and encrypt it (either, or both),
then it asks for the key to use for encryption (if you choose
to encrypt the message).  It will then ask if you want to send, edit, or abort the message.  it uses /usr/ucb/mail
instead of sendmail, since I could not figure out how to
parse the ~/.mailrc file, and since it took less than a few hours to hack out.  Anyway, here it is, it's free,
so do whatever you want with it.

I am working on a revision of my PGPcompose program,

to get bsd mail to call a program when it is going to
send mail (i.e. when you type 'mail user' or when
a message is replied to.)
So far, it (my app) can be called as follows:
comp -s  -c  -b  these arguments can be given in any order, as long
as the recipient is at the end.  It will prompt for the
information that is not provided at teh command line.
I just need to get mail to spit a subject and a recipient
out, so I can call this app.  it will do the rest.
Also, is there a fast and easy way to get mail to give me
the expanded version of a .mailrc alias from the command
line?  I read the man, and it does not look possible.

@_subject: PGPcompose 1.1 source 
===============  BEGIN README =============
PGPcompose 1.0
(c) 1993 Nate Sammons
PGPcompose is a C program (that needs to be compiled, oddly enough)
that is designed to allow for easy incorporation of digital signatures and encryption with PGP (from Phil Zimmerman).
It may be necessary to change some of the calls within PGPcompose,
so that it will access the right mailer (it is set to /usr/lib/sendmail)
etc...  It should be placed somewhere in your path, or that you
modify your path (in ~/.cshrc) so that it is.
I plan to expand PGPcompose's abilities so that it will be a complete
mailer package ready for use...  hopefully!  I want to add support for
replys and for mail management.
BTW, this software carries no warranty, and if in the use of it you break something, it's not my fault (this for all you legaleese-speakers
out there...)

two decryption chips (I think they used DSPs) that had a synchronized chaotic stream going between them, which they both used to [en,de]crypt

I tend to disagree strongly with this statement.  The physical export of

that supercomputers have been technically raised to 2000 MFLOPS, but that's
another story.  Getting time on crays, CMs, Paragons, KSRs, nCubes, whatever
is not extremely difficult, but it's pretty improbable that you'll get time
on the new Cray EL at the Pittsburg Supercomputing Center if you're a scientist living in North Korea (for example).  I suppose it's possible that
some very rich person (new, fully configured Cray T3D computers are $75M!)
you could set up a Center that took digicash for CPU time... not really
probable considering the upkeep on a Cray.
Anyway, I don't see the unrestricted use of true supercomputers in the near future... very powerful desktop/deskside machines are another
story.  (afterall, if you buy up a bunck of 2GFLOP machines (not considered
supercomputers for export) and string them together adequately, that's a hell

OK, first, LD is pissing me off, as, I am sure, he is doing to many others

is a very persistant pest, a fly in the ointment.  I think it is important
to remember that in every movement there are fanatics, and in the best of
intentions are those who would do harm while trying to crusade the good.
I believe that Detweiler is one such person.
He is experiencing some very serious problems with what he believes to be
a concerted effort by some devilish cabal to warp and mung his brain
through the rampant use of pseudospoofing.  OK, fine if he believes that,
I cannot keep him from thinking that some of us are emmisaries of Satan.

talk about him anymore.
On to pseudospoofing.  I think that it exists, and that it's denial is just plain naive.  The world is a non-friendly place, and there are dangers out there, and people who will exploit every aspect of the system
to trick, decieve, and mangle others.  This should not come as a shock to anyone on the list, since we are generally on (or close to) the cutting edge of new technologies and methods to use those technologies.  I, myself have never participated in any kind of conspiracy with intent
to confuse, nor have i ever posted under a name other than my own,
and my anon.penet.fi identity.  I have not posted as anyone that I am not,
and have no intention to do so.  I do not, however, object to the use of
these technologies, or to the act of pseudospoofing.  It cannot hope to
be prevented, since there are always people out there who will figure out
how to exploit the system to do their bidding.
Yes, it's true, I am coming out in favor of pseudospoofing.  I do not object to
it's use, on the premise that it cannot be stopped, and it rarely does hard,
aside from those (LD) whose minds are bent by the mere thought that it is
Enough of that.  Now onto the list.  I put some serious thought into
dropping from the list for the past week or so, and I have decided _not_
to leave bacause sometime there are bits of information that I get
from the list that are simply not available anywhere else.  Some of the members of the list are, however, pissing me off.  The list has degraded
from a band of freedom fighters with things they cared about in jeopardy
to a bunch of fucking children bickering over the most pathetic of things.
I hope that the recent barrage of postings is not indicative of what is to come.  If it is, then I may just reconsider and leave.
I think that's all I have to say for now... I just wanted to let people
know what I was thinking, and set the record straight if there are any members who think I am still on LD's side (which I was for quite
some time).

@_subject: Stupid childish crap cluttering the list 
Hello, out there?
The list is getting really badly cluttered with all this "lets rag on
LD since he doesn't agree with us" shit.  "Operation Medusa" -- come on, it was a little bit funny for a while, but I think that you can find better
things to do with your time than dedicate yourself to the annoyance
of someone, based on the fact that they hold different views about certain
topics near and dear to the hearts of some subscribers.  Some of us are here
to try and change things -  remember that clipper thing that so many (I think
it damn near all of us) of us were up in arms about?  It's still out there.
LD is not the enemy, he's just one of us who holds a different view...
So what if he thinks there should be no pseudospoofing.... let's kill him?
I think not.
I think that most of the list is in agreement with the idea of _not_
requiring signatures on messages.  Fine.  There, that's it.  Done.  Some
of us, me included, try to sign mail whenever possible.  Maybe it's
to set an example, maybe it's just to verify that we are who we say we are.
I even sign some of the mail that doesn't go to the list, just to get people
to ask what the hell it is -- it's raising the public awareness.  But,
I digress.
LD has told me that he is leaving the list.  Some of you may cheer, some
(the more intelligent of you, IMHO), will mourn the loss.  LD could,
at times, rant a bit, but he was a contributing member of the list.  He
had _many_ good things to say, and he is a very dedicated to privacy
(read the "Privacy and Anonymity on the Net" FAQ?) and changing things.
It _really_ pisses me off to see the little armchair Cypherpunks all gang
up when they see someone down.  "Oooo, oooo, LD's not in good favor
with the rest of the guys, let's lick 'em"  Sounds like a bunch of fucking
Beevis and Butthead fans (pardon my french).  Maybe if you guys were spending more time writing code or making the public more aware of what
the problem is and who's here to fix it, you wouldn't have the time to
organize campaigns for annoyance.
For a while, everyone thought that LD was objecting to people being able
to post anonymously (wheather it be through anon.penet.fi or bounced
off of a remailer)... that was not (I believe) his point.  He objected to
people posing as other people (who had established reputations, etc).
He wanted to outlaw (in a sense) this act.  I disagree with him here, since I cannot think of how to absolutely outlaw it (since saying "don't
do that, it's against the law" seldom works), but I can think of how
to prevent it.  Sign messages.  Don't do it if you don't want to, and don't
complain when people spoof as you because you don't ever sign the messages.
I agree with LD on the idea that posing as someone else with intent to
confuse (LD's "evil black posts" as he calls them) is wrong.
If you are trying to pursuade someone (or confuse them), you should
be smart enough to do it by being anonymous (again, through anon.penet.fi or
through a remailer) or by being yourself.  You should not need to hide behind someone else's identity.
Well, there's my opinion, please get off the subject of ragging on LD,
and get back on the track of changing the world.

necessarily decypherable by my secret key.  I replaced my keyrings from backups make a while ago (they're just missing most of my public
keys), and still no luck.  I get the following error:

work at teh visualization lab should be sent there.  My other addresses (nate at vis.colostate.edu, nate at lamar.colostate.edu,
nate at yuma.acns.colostate.edu, sammons at cs.colostate.edu and
ns111310 at longs.lance.colostate.edu) should still be used for
mail relating ot the Lab and my work there.
Thanks, and have fun!

Julian is the head of ACNS (Academic Computing and Network Services)
at CSU, and has no direct influence on lance, since lance (the network)
is run by Engineering.  Stew is the chief guy at ACNS, so is no help either.
Both are very powerful people, with lots of clout/respect around CSU,
but neither are in charge of LANCE.
Just fyi.

@_subject: GUI for a remailer! 
Check out:
It's a test of a remailer based in a WWW HyperText Server, coded by
yours truly.  You need a WWW client that supports "forms" to see it,
so try NCSA's Mosaic 2.1 for X. (available from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu
in /Mosaic -- they have binaries for most machines.)
Tell me if you would like to set one up for yourself, and I would
be glad to help.
Please realize that this is just a test.  Don't use it for remailing,
just for seeing if you like it.
Thanks, and have fun,

Sorry for the brevity of the announcement, I had just finished it and
needed to get to class ;-)
OK, I'll start from the beginning (pardon if this is too much info).
NCSA has a product (available for Xwindows, MS Windows, and the Mac) called
Mosaic.  It is a HyperText client (server if your in X, I suppose) that
lets the user graphically connect to Gopher, WAIS, and many other
already-established information servers (including ftp).  The big advantage, however is that it can connect to machines running a WWW server,
the most popular, and functional I might add, of these servers is the
"HTTPD" server from NCSA itself.  It's a long story, but httpd stands for
HyperText Transfer Protocol Daemon.  Anyway, check with NCSA for more info
on httpd.
HTTPD 1.0 allows the use of "forms" where I can program in (with extreme ease)
text boxes, check boxes, radio buttons, menus, selectable lists, etc.
One the other end, the client (Mosaic) interprets this, and will let
the user fill out the form and submit it.  On my end, a little program
catches a stream of data coming from the "world out there" and decodes it
so that I can pick out what the user typed into the text boxes, which
check boxes are checked, etc...  it's quite cool and very easy.  The decoding
of the data is not really difficult, especially since NCSA provides some
functions that will decode it into an array of structures with fields called "name" and "val" -- it's pretty straight forward.
My form takes what a user types into the TO: and SUBJECT: boxes, checks to
see that the TO: box is not empty and that it has a more-or-less correct
email address in it (it checks for an ' in the value).  It then creates
a temp file, writes some generic info into it, adds the text from the
text box, and makes a system call to mail off the file and destroy it.
I coded the whole thing up in about 30 minutes this afternoon.
I will be adding check boxes to bounce the mail throught remailers and
to do encryption for remailers.  I will also add the ability to send
mail through anon.penet.fi.  For the password to anon.penet.fi,
I will use a feture wchich allows the text written in a field to
show up as asterics (just for those paranoids out there ;-)  As for absolute security, you would just have to trust that I will not be archiving these messages, etc, which I will not.  Also, the Mosaic server
has the ability to log the IP address from which the connection comes,
but as yet, it has no way of figuring out the login name of the person
on the other end.
Incidently, this whold thing has some *really* cool possibilities.  The
new HTTPD (1.x) allows for user authentication via passwords -- each
directory can have an associated password and group databse... just think of having authentication systems that will let "strangers" send mail
in this manner and do all kinds of things virtually anonymously.  I really
must applaud the NCSA folks for coming up with this, as it has more
possibilities that they could have ever dreamt of (which is, I suppose,
the mark of really good software).
For people wishing to start up their own remailers, even if they don't have
access to a machine to make the server, if your site has a server,
ask your administrator about "user directories" -- this is where the server
has a specified directory that goes in a user's home directory into which
users can dump HTML documents (HyperText Markup Language)... for instance,
on my server, the directory is called "mosaic-public" so if I have a reference to " then the
server figures out that it is actually a link to the file
~nate/mosaic-public/testing.html -- very cool, and actually damn easy for
a server admin to set up.
Fee free to ask questions.

Your version of Mosaic may not support forms.  Try getting the
latest version from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /Mosaic/Mosaic-bin/something
I think the latest is either 2.1 or 2.2

Hey guys.
I have been gone for a few weeks now, taking care of lots of personal

@_subject: email file server, remailer interface, WIRED 
I would like to announce the completion of my email based fileserver,
which takes commands in the same way the remailers do:
The main commands are:
::      Sends an info file about the server, with command explanations,
help    and other goodies.
::             Of all the strange things, it sends the requested filename
send filename
::     Sends a list of all available files and their descriptions
I am running one at nate at vis.colostate.edu  try it out.
I also have a more refined remailer interface package which lets people
send mail through the remailer network with a nice WWW forms interface.
The scripts are available from my fileserver, send for a list to get
the software.
A **NON FUNCTIONAL** demo of the interface can be seen at
That document also has a link about getting the software, etc.
The interesting thing is that this interface will be featured in the
netsurf section of the August issue of WIRED magazine!

Three people named "Duncan" "Matt" and "Michael" were not able
to get filelists from my server because the script was not
looking for their address like it was supposed to.  This problem has now
been fixed, and if you could try again, I would be thankful.
