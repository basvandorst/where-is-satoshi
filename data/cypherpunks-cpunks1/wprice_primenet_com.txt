@_subject: ANNOUNCE: CryptDisk 1.2 for Macintosh 
I'm pleased to announce that version 1.2 of CryptDisk for Macintosh is now
The Winner of MacUser's 1995 Shareware Award for Personal Tools, CryptDisk
is a soft partition encryptor for the Macintosh.  It lets you create
"files" of any size which can be mounted as if they were hard drives on
your desktop.  These files are encrypted/decrypted on the fly using the
IDEA encryption algorithm.  IDEA is an internationally known algorithm that
uses 128-bit keys.  Most cryptographers consider it significantly superior
to the government's DES standard.  CryptDisk makes data security a seamless
integrated component of your desktop allowing you instant access to huge
numbers of encrypted files including the ability to play QuickTime movies
directly from CryptDisks.
IMPROVEMENTS IN 1.2:
* CryptDisks can now be used on read-only volumes allowing CryptDisks to be
mounted from CD-ROMs.  Locking a CryptDisk in the Finder will also mount it
as a read only volume.
* New interface for specifying disk sizes allows arbitrarily sized disks
from 64K on up.  CryptDisks can now be sized to take up all the space on a
floppy disk.
* CryptDisk now dynamically informs the user for each volume how much
contiguous space is available to create a CryptDisk before specifying the
* The public distribution now contains native PowerPC code for the
application itself.  Previously, only the driver was native in the public
* A serious security hole was plugged that should affect only a very small
number of users.  Please follow the release notes to make sure you are not
affected and to take appropriate steps if you are.
* CryptDisk is now much more robust about mounting disks and will inform
the user of the nature of any problems it has mounting disks.
Information on obtaining the latest version is available to US and Canadian
citizens from:
or by visiting the web page:
You may also be able to obtain it from other export controlled FTP sites
around the US as it gets distributed.
CryptDisk is shareware for $20.  The source code is also available for an
extra $20.  Registered users receive access to beta versions of CryptDisk
and are sent announcements about its status periodically.

ANNOUNCEMENT: PGPfone Beta 7 Now Available for Download
MIT has released Philip Zimmermann's PGPfone 1.0b7 for Macintosh and
1.0b2 for Windows95 or NT.  This new secure telephone product is now
available for download at the MIT PGP distribution web site:
     or:  Using PGPfone is like using a telephone, except no one else can
eavesdrop on your conversation.  PGPfone lets you whisper in someone's
ear, even if their ear is a thousand miles away.  Secure voice calls
are supported over the Internet, or through a direct modem-to-modem
connection, or even over AppleTalk networks.
PGPfone uses Diffie-Hellman public-key technology to provide encryption
keys for the user's selection of CAST, TripleDES, or Blowfish
encryption algorithms.  A unique biometric authentication feature uses
spoken words to authenticate the Diffie-Hellman key exchange allowing
easy authentication of secure calls.  This new version introduces CAST,
a fast and well-designed new encryption algorithm from Northern
Telecom.  The use of Diffie-Hellman in PGPfone allows secure calls to
parties that are not previously known to the caller -- no prior key
exchange over other channels is necessary.
PGPfone 1.0b2 for Windows is an improved version which is now on par
with the Macintosh version.  It now supports silence detection, much
improved sound quality, significantly reduced latency, completely new
interface, faster call negotiation, and some important bug fixes.
A commercial version of PGPfone will be available in the fall from
Phil's new company, Pretty Good Privacy, Inc.  The company may be
contacted at 415 631-1747, or at
