@_subject: PGP bought by McAfee 
Varous Questions, comments rants, etc.:
Does anyone know how this will affect PGP's:
security, commitment to no-GAK, Founder (P. Zimmerman), the continuation
of the PGP product line?
I heard that McAfee's PCCrypto product will still be sold by NETA as a
retail product, (are they considering incorperating the 2 together and just using PGP's team for R&D?)
