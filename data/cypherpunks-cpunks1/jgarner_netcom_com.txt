@_subject: Does anyone know of any specific cases 
Does anyone know of any specific legal cases which have tested or are testing
this issue of a conflict between the 5th amendment and Obstruction of Justice?
Seems I read about something like this recently in a California newspaper but
I cant seem to remember the case.
