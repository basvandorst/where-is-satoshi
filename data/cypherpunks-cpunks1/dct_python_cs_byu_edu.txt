@_subject: dispersed DES 
I have come up with (and implemented) a version of triple DES for true
paranoids, which I call dispersed DES.  All I do is append four bytes to
the beginning of the output files for each cycle of triple DES.  It seems
like this should provide even more security than triple DES, but I am no
expert. Any comments?  Please include "dct at newt.cs.byu.edu" in your replies,
as I am unable to maintain access to the mailing list because of volume.

Good point about the source of the appended bytes.  The reason I think it might
be more secure is that the length of the appended segment is less than the
length of the key on each pass, so it would seem to be the equivalent of a
one-time pad for those relying on the appended bytes to get the key.  That is my
only basis for not worrying about wekening effects.  Any holes?

Thanks for all the replies on Dispersed DES - a bit wiser now, I have decided
to junk that version of the idea (seeing as CBC probably provides a great deal
more protection with seemingly much lower security cost).
