@_subject: [p2p-hackers] How Piracy Will Hyperlocalize with Mesh Networks 
In how far is this geographic routing supposed to help? Finding routes to the
other end of the mesh which you do not use anyway?
Well, let's see which possibilities exist for defining addresses:
1) You have a very small address space and search the network to see if your
   randomly generated address is already in use before you use it.
2) You have a big address space and just generate an address and assume nodody
   else uses it.
3) You use public keys of a public-private key crypto to make sure nobody can
   "take over" somebody else's address.
If IPv6 can not even do 2 without any quirks it has *zero* reason for
existance in mesh networks. Not even "the outside is using IPv6" (they are
 *not*) is an argument, because you usually want to create an encrypted tunnel
to the exit node anyway.
IPv4 is *not* dead. Everybody is using it. I do not know a single ISP who
provides it to their customers. Besides IPv6 is close to being the worst you
can do from a privacy point of view. Getting rid of NAT is a very bad idea.
Having the last 64 bits globally unique no matter where you more is very bad
is well. Even privacy extensions (*if* used) are not as good, because addresses
will not get reused. Having the first 64 bits static is even worse. I seriously
doubt that it is not even necessary. Providers start implementing carrier side
NAT and if done right (with UPnP or other means of forwarding ports without
user intervention), this can be a significant privacy gain without any side
Yes I know how much application can be fingerprinted, but this does not mean
that we should constantly be adding ever more identifying information.
