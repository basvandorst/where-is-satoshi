        Well, let me eat my words.  Unless all layers turn on
encryption at the same time, and there is not predictable text
that passes from one layer to the next, adding encryption at
each layer cannot substantially improve the size of the key
space.  Consider two layers each of which has a verifiable
header and a body of encrypted text.  By "verifyable", I mean
that it contains enough redundancy to recognize a correct
decryption of the cipher added by the lower layer.  For example,
a header that included a content type field and a length field
could be examined to see if it looked reasonable, and thus
confirm a guess at the lower level's cipher.
                Plaintext-Body-1
                 Layer-1-cipher
      Header-1, Encrypted-Body-1
            Layer-2-cipher
   Header-2, Encrypted-Body-2
        To crack this system, an attacker does brute force search
of the keyspace for the layer-2-cipher, for each key check the
decrypted Header-1 value to see if it looks OK, if not, continue,
otherwise start searching the keyspace for the Layer-1-cipher
given the candidate for the Encrypted-Body-1 produced by the
guess at the Layer-2-cipher key.  Clearly, if you have several
layer 2 blocks and they all have good looking values for the
Header-1, then the Layer-2-cipher key is correct.
        The summary is that two layers of 40 bit ciphers with
the first layer adding some verifiable information, has the effect
of adding at most one bit to the effective keysize (doubling the
amount of work).  It DOES NOT increase the keysize to 80 bits.
                --Bob Baldwin
______________________________ Reply Separator
        Long ago vendors should have put encryption into network layer
products, but for a variety of reasons that effort was delayed or
discouraged.  One effect of this lack is that almost every layer of
the network stack is adding its own encryption.  For example, the
HTTP session layer added S-HTTP and the TCP transport layer added
SSL.  Soon we will have network layer encryption with IPsec.
        The vendors for each layer can export a product that uses
ciphers with 40 bit keys.  A user can then combine multiple
products to get more than 40 bits worth of security.  For example,
a web client might fetch an S-HTTP page over an SSL protected link
via a firewall that supports IPsec tunnels.  That's three 40 bit
keys protecting the data over the internet link (of course, this
may not be equivalent to a 120 bit cipher, that depends on the
details of the cipher systems and independence of the key setups).
Interesting possibilities.

This is the second time you've implied that an MD5 checksum might not be
as secure as we think.  Could you share your thinking on this?  I had
believed from reading the algorithm that it's not possible to predict how
a change in the input will affect the checksum.  Given a modified version
of netscape for example, how would you change some non-critical portion   the code to get the same checksum that the original should have.  I   that give n bits of non-critical space in the code, (non-critical meaning
that changing them will have no effect on the execution of the code, and
assuming that you don't want to change the length of the code), that you
could try all possible combinations of those bits, or 2^n trials and
see if you get the correct MD5 checksum.  If you do, then on average   actually only have to try 2^(n-1) trials. What if you don't?  What would
you do then?  MD5 produces a 128 bit output, and it would seem likely   this would be hard.  As far as I know there are no known attacks for any
MDx algorithms in spite of Ron's worries about MD4.  It's a subject of
on-going research though, and it is only "conjectured that it is
computationally infeasible to produce two messages having the same
message digest, or to produce any messages having a given prespecified
target message digest." (RFC 1321)  So, if you have newer information,
or pointers to any papers, (other than the ben Boer and Bosselaers   could you let me know?

         August 18-22, 1996, Santa Barbara, California, USA
                          CALL FOR PAPERS
General Information:
Crypto '96, the Sixteenth Annual Crypto Conference, is organized by the
International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR), in
cooperation with the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on
Security and Privacy, and the Computer Science Department of the
University of California, Santa Barbara.  Original papers are solicited
on all technical aspects of cryptology.
Instructions for Authors:
Please send a cover letter, one title page and 16 copies of an extended
abstract.  They must be received by the Program Chair at the address
given below no later than February 14, 1996 (or postmarked by February
4, 1996 and sent via airmail).
The cover letter must state: "This paper does not substantially
duplicate work that any of the authors have published elsewhere or have
submitted in parallel to any other conference or workshop that has
The title page should contain the title, the names of the authors, their
postal and e-mail addresses and the short abstract; it should be made
clear who is the author to whom correspondence should be sent.  The
first page of the extended abstract should be an informal one-page
statement (that will not be published in the Proceedings) describing the
content of the oral presentation that will be given at Crypto '96 in the
event the paper is accepted (this statement is expected to be different
from the short abstract of the paper).  This page and the extended
abstract must be ANONYMOUS, i.e., they must contain no indication
whatsoever of the identity of the author(s).  The main body of the
extended abstract should start with the title, short abstract, and list
of keywords.  This should be followed by a succinct statement
appropriate for a non-specialist reader specifying the subject
addressed, its background, the main achievements, and their significance
to cryptology.  Technical details directed to the specialist should then
Submissions are limited to 10 single-spaced pages of 11pt type, not
counting the bibliography and clearly marked appendices.  Since referees
are not required to read the appendices, the paper should be
intelligible without them.  The paper including bibliography and
appendices must run to no more than 15 pages.  These limits will be
strictly enforced.
Unfortunately, because of the burdens on the Program Committee and
the need to keep strictly to the time schedule, we will have to
summarily reject any submission not in keeping with the above
Authors are encouraged to make 2-sided copies if possible.  Please send
submissions by post; unfortunately, we cannot accept submissions by
e-mail or fax.
Notification of acceptance or rejection will be sent to authors on
April 22, 1996.
Conference Proceedings:
Proceedings will be available at the meeting.  They will be published in
the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science.  Clear
instructions about the final copy will be sent to authors of accepted
papers.  The final copies of the accepted papers will be due on June 1,
1996.  Final papers arriving too late will be removed from the main
program.  Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper
will be presented at the conference.
A limited number of stipends are available to those unable to obtain
funding to attend the conference.  Students whose papers are accepted
and who will present the paper themselves are encouraged to apply if
such assistance is needed.  Requests for stipends should be addressed to
the general chair.

I'm pleased to report that USA Today editorializes today (Tuesday, Oct.   1995) against both ITAR and GAK.
They get the chronology of the SSL brute-forcing and PRNG seed prediction
attacks on Netscape Navigator backwards, but they get many other things   in a fairly short editorial. I am certainly encouraged by this   Someone at USA Today definitely got the message that the ITAR are a large
obstacle to net security in the U.S.
Some particularly apropos quotations (from pg. 12A):
On ITAR:
 "[After the Netscape hacks] the perception of the Internet as
  insecure was indelible. That needn't be. Encryption software
  available right now is exponentially more powerful and could
  make code breaking virtually impossible. Its use is blocked
  by government export regulations that make the programs
  difficult if not impossible to market, even for domestic
  purposes."
On GAK:
 "[...] key escrow [...] may sound reasonable, but apply that
  reasoning to more mundane areas of life. What the government
  is saying is yes, you can put bars on your windows, locks on
  your doors and put your jewelry in a safe, but you have to
  give us the keys and the combination because you might be a
  crook."
That phrasing sounds rather familiar....
 "The [GAK] system -- which the FBI and the Commerce Department
  declined to defend in an opposing view to this editorial [...]"
Now I find that surprising. Since when does the FBI not even try to   Clipper and its descendants in the newspapers ?
For foreign readers, I'll note that USA Today has easily the largest
national circulation of any daily newspaper in the U.S.

We very much need a command line interface to S/MIME, to use in remailers
and also for other kinds of testing/hacking. I hope one is forthcoming
Raph does indeed have some input on the matter. I am currently rewriting
premail from the ground up, and am about 700 lines into it. One specific
design goal was the support of other types of encryption, including
Mixmaster and MOSS in the first release, and hopefully others as well.
Basically, I'm waiting on a command line S/MIME implementation as
described above, most hopefully as free software.
In any case, the new premail is _much_ more modular, so plugging in
experimental email stuff should be pretty straightforward.

Even if you assume complete independence of key setup, if a successful
decryption at each layer can be independently detected and verified
(which seems likely in your example), there're only about 3 * (2 ^ 40)
total operations in the worst case, NOT 2 ^ (3 * 40) operations needed
to expose the plaintext.  This is an effective 41.5 bits, not 120.

things I could be confused about which may make this a bit wrong..

decryption. Remailer spams have the bad effect of spwaning hundreds of
concurrent PGPs on the mailhost, bringing things to halt. Limiting
number of concurrent decryptions would help this problem.
B) A strong interaction with the UNIX shell, with the program
returning a return code based on whether or not the decryption
succeeded. (Remailers only do decryptions...) That way a remailer
could something like:
if smime -f < incoming-message > /tmp/decrypted.$$
  # Process /tmp/decrypted
rm incoming-message
rm /tmp/decrypted.$$
 The option would also be a very low-cruft-output -- there
would be none of that PGP v2.6.2 stuff that PGP sends out. Just the
decrypted output and if the message cant be decrypted, nothing gets
output. (Maybe a -q option for that..)
 I think the smime should be easily plugged into premail as
well, but I don't know premail to know what would be necessary for
that. I suspect Raph would have some input on that matter.

To All,
    A theme I have been thinking about lately is a virtual
data haven using a m from n secret splitting scheme via
a DC Net for access and hosting the entire process via HTML
and W3. The salient feature would be database objects split in such a way   sites would possess no more than 1 encrypted slice of any particular
encrypted object. Some redundancy of storage is built into the design and
participating site give up local storage to store other slices
of the datahaven. At no time is the site hosting able to
make correlations of slices to plaintext traffic because the
split is done on the users workstation and the placement of the slice
on the individual slice on the member datahaven site is accomplished with
encrypted remailer tech(probably Mixmaster 2) and CGI or java
scripts. The idea here is to be able to store ANY information on the net
not just what the local bluenoses approve of.

 Assuming you could somehow, how do you proceed to use that information    your advantage?

How would you proceed, even in principle, to    MD5? I realize I might be assuming too much when I posit that I have the
 true MD5 for the message but my understanding is that you feel that MD5
 might be vulnerable. I've given you all the known plaintexts. Is there a
 next step?

Since you asked:
It's a really complex issue.
 As a fundamental, we know that any "one-way" hash function must
be many-to-one, which means that, in practice, there are always large
numbers (2^large numbers) of sources for any given hash.  This means
that forgeries are always possible.
 I know of no way to prove that (and no convincing argument that
the workload for creating) a forgery is hard for any "one-way" hash
function.  This seems to mean that we are always betting on faith about
these things.
 The techniques that seem to be reasonably good are; modular
exponentiation in a modulus that's the product of two appropriate primes
(a.k.a.  RSA but throw out the private key when you create it); certain
classes of non-linear feedback shift registers of high degree; and some
general class of mixing algorithms like MD5.
 The RSA-type hash is slow, and some great mathematician may show
up tomorrow and lay waste to the whole thing.  Non-linear feedback shift
registers have the advantage that we don't know how to factor
high-degree equations, so we don't know how to make simple closed form
solutions to find output values.  MD5-type systems are good because they
combine diffusion and confusion and avoid a lot of the more well-known
flaws as far as we know.
 None of these reasons are particularly convincing, so I think we
have to take a risk management approach.  So the ultimate question here
is, how much are we willing to bet that nobody can break one of these in
the intended application over a particular time frame.
 I trust the RSA and NLFSR systems, if reasonably well
implemented, for a single short time-frame low-valued transaction.  For
example, pick a good pseudo-random number and create an RSA one-way hash
of 512 bits (the random number issue is of course another whole area),
encrypt the first bloack, Xor with the second block, encrypt the result,
etc.  till done, then Xor again with the original random seed, send the
file and the hash along with the one-way key, and get a confirmation
back within a few days.
 I don't trust any of them as a basis for running a major part of
an economy over open communications links, and I especially don't trust
them when combined or when the security of one depends on another.  To
run an economy, I think you need more redundancy, more personnel
security, more stop-loss capabilities, physically secure devices,
independent checks and balances, etc.
 Someone on this list mentioned that the banking system trusts
the RSA and MD5, etc.  but this seems to me to be a mischaracterization.
They trust these systems to an extent, but they have key change
requirements, regular audits, physical security, relatively secured
communications lines (when compared to the Internet), strong procedural
controls (most of the time), and other such protections, and they still
get hammered for a few million now and then.
 This is probably enough for now, since the list is probably
getting tired of my posts and I have made the major points.

Sorry abopt the above flame-war I caused.
My point was almost benign in and of itself. Yes, the Java concept is
sound, No, the currently available implementation has some real
architectural considerations that must be addressed in order that we can
build a stable and secure platform atop it.
My real issue is that there is so much time spent on this list knocking   individual spokes that make up this wheel we call Electronic Commerce,   it is more and more costly to filter out the technology from the   noise. Still because of the value of that technology, I and others are
forced to spend precious hours reviewing all that comes across our desks.

to MD5, it is worth noting that Hans Dobbertin of the German Information

allows you to generate a pair of plainexts that generate the same hash.

Ron has not mentioned such an event to me and if that were the case I   seriously doubt that he would not have been told about it. The only   generally makes is that he wrote MD5 because "MD4 was making me nervous".
Netscape do not simply use the MD5 of the message, they are using (as I
understand it) the PKCS standard for makoing the signature. If not they   probably have severe problems.
NIST and the NSA trusted MD4 sufficiently to base SHA upon it. SHA is
in many ways to MD5, it has a different approach to extending the   resist differential cryptanalysis. There is a problem with the compressor   function of MD5 which I dislike. This is fairly irrelevant though since   allows other digests to be used.

I don't believe this $250 is correct.  The only place I see such a number
is on the application form, in the following clause:
"A maintenance fee of the foreign equivalent of $10 will be imposed each
statement period if the balance in your account falls below the foreign
equivalent of $250 on any day of the period."
This is for a "WorldCurrency Access Interest Account", which I don't
think is what is used for ecash.  For ecash the account opening fee is
$11 and the per-month fee is $5.  I don't see any reference to required
account minimums.
As far as the issue of coding up a payee-blinding cash system compatible
with this ecash, I agree that it would be good to see some specs now that
ecash is for real.  IMO Chaum has been getting a free ride based on his

Proofs can help identify flaws, but they can never rule out all flaws.
That's why their name is so bogus. I wouldn't be surprised if you could
prove that the Finger daemon, which is sort of like a really low-level

Two reasons.  One, it cuts down on traffic.  Why bother to waste the
server's bandwidth on something the client can't read anyway.  The only
possible reason someone could be asking for the data is because they're
trying to compromise the key or do traffic analysis.  Why help bad
Second, there's no reason the messages need to be encrypted.  The
server can accept messages addressed to *any* string of eight hex
digits, and doesn't care about the content.  The server needn't limit
the kinds of encryption used in the actual message.  It only cares that
the recipient is "really" (in some sense) the right reciever.
The original mental prompt for the idea came from the discussion of
the "key-is-the-person" model.  I was trying to devise a scenario where
it was possible to know of an entity only through his key, and came up
with this.  I also included the idea that messages signed by the key
would be forwarded by the server after being pseudonymized to the
keyid.  That way, the user could participate in mailing lists purely
identified by the key.
