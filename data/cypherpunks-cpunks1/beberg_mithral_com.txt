There over 800 prison camps in the United States, all fully operational
and ready to receive prisoners. They are all staffed and even surrounded
by full-time guards, but they are all empty. These camps are to be
operated by FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) should Martial
Law need to be implemented in the United States and all it would take is
a presidential signature on a proclamation and the attorney general's
signature on a warrant to which a list of names is attached. Ask
yourself if you really want to be on Ashcroft's list.

"It" is not a point event. It's a long, ongoing process.
And yes, we're in it, but that is obvious to everyone. You're asking when to prepare, and the answer to that is to always be prepared.
This is a better data point...
Town makes it's own currency, wildly popular for local purchase. Most importantly (and not obvious) is that you could depeg it from the dollar the moment the shit hits the fan, and repeg it to the Canadian dollar, or something real. Merchants win even with the 10% "discount", since you avoid the visa/mastercard fees.
More of this is coming, state currencies aren't far behind.

Nice to see the phone company (read: government) is tracking us all in real time to ~3m. Damn good thing they can't find their ass with both hands, since their leader is severely retarded, or I'd be worried. Hell they can't find 15m+ illegals, so we should be safe.
I wonder how long it takes between saying "stem cell evolution" on a phone call and the SWAT team showing up? Hmmmm...

@_subject: [FoRK] New threat for UK's offshore havens: tax 
The UK is broke, no more free ride in the territories. This isn't about stopping the rich from hiding their money which is the primary function of government. For the middle class tho...
They are now opening up ALL safety deposit boxes over there, and taking whatever they want, until you can prove it's yours - which you cannot obviously. How convenient. Not as bad as what they do in California, but then again keeping your family jewels in a building that is controlled by those that will do anything to maintain power, isn't such a great idea is it.
When the drug dealer and other underground economy workers are the only ones left that have jobs, you have to do whatever is necessary to get your cut if taxes don't work, right? It's always the tax evasion that they get you for, because that is THEIR money you're not paying.
The governments are broke, and those government jobs all still need to get paid, so now we have entered the kleptocracy phase where they take stuff and print money exponentially.
Fun times, fun times...
