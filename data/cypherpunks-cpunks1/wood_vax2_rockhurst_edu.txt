@_subject: commerical busters 
dan
 Hello all,
 I have thought about this before, as usual my ideas are not new.
 My vision was like this.   1. Develop a few methods to recognize commercials through cable T.V.
 	a. The blank spaces between broadcasting?
 	b. Analysis of image information?
 	c. Analysis of sound information?
 	d. Understanding cable T.V. protocols?
 	e. etc?  2. My commerical buster would work on a delay.
 	a. The broadcast information would enter a queue.
 	b. The broadcast information would be evaulated.
 	c. If all of the tests for commericals passed, display.
 	d. If any of the tests fail, the T.V. goes blue, and
 		my CD player is served.
 	e. The time of delay is dependent on the time to analyze
 		the broadcast information.
 I wish it could happen, I hate commericals.
 Many Thanks,
