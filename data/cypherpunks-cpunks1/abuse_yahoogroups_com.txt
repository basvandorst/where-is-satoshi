@_subject: Abuse - Unauthorized Subscription  (KMM50578543V35371L0KM) 
We apologize for the unsolicited subscription, which we understand was not expected. We allow users to create email distribution and discussion
groups for free -- and a user seems to have ignored our policies and added you to his or her list without your permission.
Per your request, you have been removed from the group and you should no
longer receive messages associated with it. We will investigate the situation and take the appropriate action.  We are very concerned about preventing the abuse in Yahoo! Groups, and we will continue to evaluate any groups that violate Yahoo! Groups Terms of

   Original Message Follows: What Group are you reporting?
  Anti-Immigration
Type your feedback here:
 "Cypherpunks" is a mailing list on an unrelated topic which has been subscribed to the Anti-Immigration group. This means that everyone on the Cypherpunks list has to receive this vile irrelevant racist drivel! Surely it is against your policy to subcribe entire mailing lists to other mailing lists. Please delete this unwanted subscription immediately! Thank you.
