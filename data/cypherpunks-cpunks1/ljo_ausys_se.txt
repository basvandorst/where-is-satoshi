@_subject: VisaCash security. 
A couple of weeks ago I was giving a talk at a conferance on
computer technology in financial applications in Stockholm.
I mentioned VISA:s electronic purse 'Smart Cash' in my talk
and during the break afterwards a representative from a danish
bank told me that VISA:s 'Smart Cash' was actually bought from
the danish purse/project 'Danmont'. Does anyone know the truth
of this, please let me know.

@_subject: Timing Cryptanalysis Attack 
At first glance, smart cards would seem to be the most critical target
to Kocher's timing attack since they usually operate in on-line
However, all RSA smart cards I'm aware of stores the result of the
RSA computation (be it decryption, signing or authentication)
internally and it can only be read using a Get_Response command.
Of course this may not be satisfying since the terminal could get a
(noisy) measure of the time by repeatingly use this command to
see when the result is available.
Most smart cards does nevertheless require that the user must first
specify a PIN code before the RSA algorithms are operationable.
This implies that even if the card gets stolen can't it be attacked
with Kocher's method.

I just found this at RSA:s  home page:

When did Dr. Rivest develop this "blinding" technique?
Was it pre or post Chaum?
Perhaps Rivest himself have applied for this patent.

@_subject: (cpx) Digicash tagged with payee? 
Where have you heard that? Everything I've heard from DigiCash seems
to indicate that no such "payee encoding" is performed.
It is possible though with other (teoretical) protocols, such as Chaum,
Fiat and Naor's off-line cash scheme (briefly described in Schneirer's
book 'Applied Cryptography') and especially the (off-line) cash system,
developed by Stefan Brands.
In these systems, when Alice spends a coin at Bob's shop she has to
respond to a random challenge, sent to her by Bob. This random challenge
could possibly be a hash of Bob's identity and some other values.
My impression though is that this is not a feature of the current
implementation of ecash.
It is conceivable to think of the above mentioned methods in that way,  yes

@_subject: Info needed on observers 
The concept 'Wallet (Databases) with Observers' was introduced by
David Chaum and Torben Pryds Pedersen at Crypto '92. See the
proceedings of that conference. Put shortly, it is a method of preventing
double spending of digital cash, stored on a smart card, and still
provide full payer anonymity.
Since then, others have worked on improving the original protocol,
e.g. Ronald Cramer, Niels Ferguson and Stefan Brands. In particular
the system by Stefan Brands have drawn much attention since it was
said to offer "provable security". It is his protocol that is used in the
european project CAFE.
In CAFE, each user is thought to have a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant)
which stores the digital cash. The observer is a smart card that has to
be inserted into the PDA in order to spend that cash. I don't know how
far this project has come, implementation wise but I think another project,
called SWAP was about to test these electronic wallets in practise.
