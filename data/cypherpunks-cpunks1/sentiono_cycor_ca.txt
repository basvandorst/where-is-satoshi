@_subject: Netscape question transformed 
Yeah right. Way to go, Jeff.
You even say that OS/2 Windows better than Windows itself. Get real.
Don't you even realize that OS/2 is another OS! It has its own API. Stop treating other OS-es whose have emulator with the original one. Netscape uses some low-level MS-Windows specific API in order to run it well. How could you expect it run under emulator?
Now, wait! .. PowerPC will have OS/2 .. therefore, Netscape will say, sorry folks - you have to use Netscape for Windows .. bla-bla-bla.
Get real Jeff. Many people try to improve and make a wonderful product better, and Netscape certainly one of it. See how many people have pledge (even begged - I heard) Netscape to make Netscape for OS/2 (not to mention Amiga (oh ya, I forgot, Netscape will tell Amiga users to use Mac version because Amiga can run Mac-emulator - ha ha)).
That's true enough.

@_subject: Netscape for OS/2, when? (Re: Another Netscape Bug) 
Same here. For more information (not Netscape related), Web Explorer
1.02 for OS/2 also crashes for the long URL.
I wish Netscape will port it to OS/2 (already ask them, but no comment
from Netscape). I don't try it on Netscape 1.1N as it doesn't run
reliably under Win-OS/2 (10 min -> crash! ;)

Dear Tim,
It seems to me the sender is only *one* person who wants to agitate us. The chances for different people to send requests in sequence although being warned is very small. To maintainer, please forward me the original trace-points to trace down who is the *agitator* here.
Anyone care to track this *annoying* person down?

@_subject: OFF Topic: MS-Exchange bug (winmail.dat) 
I need help to disable the long-trailer from MS-Exchange. Everytime my friend sends me an e-mail, the "trailer" (winmail.dat)
always there. How to disable it or turn it off? I believe someone
mention about this "feature" in this mailing list long time ago, but
I can't find it in my archive. Thank you.
ps. can Winmail.Dat be considered as cryto-useless?

@_subject: www.WhosWhere.com selling access to my employer's passwd file 
I wonder how they can get the e-mail address? Our finger daemon are blocked. Many un-broadcast e-mail addresses (the account never send any e-mails to anyone) are in the database. How?
Furthermore, isn't it also privacy invasion? Would any hackers or expert people kindly to tell me how to block further threat like this? Or tell me the way they do it, and I'll try to think the way to prevent it in the future.

@_subject: Indonesia detains democracy activist after post to mailing list 
Hi there,
Just to add gasoline on the burning flame. It doesn't happen just now. It is always like that. The attention on Indonesia issues by people (western media) is too
much focus on East Timor and they forget that there are much more
severe violations happening. I just hope that this example will open people's eyes that
Indonesian's problems are not only East Timor affairs but much more.
Arrest of one mailing list's maintainer is common, you would be
surprised how many people actually 'disappear' because of this.

@_subject: Good dictionary files? 
As many people say, a good password cracker is very dependent on the
dictionary file(s). When one has a very good dictionary file(s), the
chances of password being cracked is bigger. I am wondering if
someone can tell me where I can get good dictionary file(s). Search
on the web result to nothing. I have one large dictionary file (about
14Mb) to check it, but I still not feel comfortable to say it's a
good one. This might be off topic from cryptography, but until we can reverse
engineer (decrypt the crypt or crypt(3)) functions, nothing we can do
but to rely on those good dictionaries. Thank you and I apologize for anyone who might get offended by my
