The only real legality of requiring some form of payment is that if they

have to take any form of federal reserve currency (eg the penny).  This
means that when your parking ticket says you can't pay in change, you can
still pay in change.  Legally (according to CNN anyway, i've never
bothered to actually go look it up) if you ofer to pay something in
change, and they decline, you can give them one warning, and _assuming a
debt is previously incurred (eg parking ticket, not new pants) you don't
have to pay.
Unfortunatly, they can decline cash/change completely, or decline checks,
or decline credit cards.  But if they take one dollar bills, go by the
bank first and get it in pennies.  Pay with that.

2) copy the chip.
3) now go cash both at seperate ATM machines, the same day.
4) pay off your loan. (you decided you didn't NEED a house after all)
5) move to switzerland, because this is VERY tracable.
you now have $100,000 CASH, and a small paper trail. No cryptanalisys

Good Idea, but I also like the idea of selective-duress, i.e. not
necisarily having a duress key at all.
I have several friends that this has happened to, and pretty much it goes
like this... round 7:00 AM, when your just going to bed (well, some of us
don't have jobs till nighttime.. thank god.), they knock down your doors
and windows (yes, they do come through windows), and they take the
equipment, disks, tv's, CD players (yes, i know somebody who had their CD
player taken.  And a pile of CDs. Music ones even.), clock radios, pretty
much everything electronic they can cary.  If you ever DO get any of it
back, most likely it is not the same equipment, i.e. they coppied it all
and kept the original.
I do agree that nuking the data isn't the way to go.  Most of the time if
you crypted something, you're probably gonna want it back.
There's also an Idea me and Mouse had, which is to have a fault-tolerant
duress system.  Its something like this...  You have a Duressfs and a
Non-Duressfs.  If they enter the duress key is entered wrong, but only by
a certain percentage of characters (i.e. sex instead of hex), it lets you
see the Duressfs.  If you do this too many consecutive times, it runs the
DuressNuke function (optional?).  If you put the Duress key in correctly
it runs the DuressNuke function.  If you put the secret key in, it gives
you the non-Duress version.
that way if they didn't beleive you're "near-duress" key, you can give
them the actual duress key to nuke the data.
Just an idea.

Well, I know the higher-end NorTel and Lucent switches (ah la the DMS100,
200, 250, the 5ESS and the 1AESS) there are, basicly, 5 catagories... 911, toll free (800,888,local non-metered), extra charge (900/976), and
pretty much non-metered is the only one that doesn't do the dest/src
recording (unless you've got a DNR put on your line, which usually means
the USSS/FBI are breathing down your neck.  Had it happen once. definatly
not fun.)
Of course, those switches are all programmable, so you can add more.
Only on metered calls (includeing 800/900 type) at most places.
But most of the time (ok, most numbers, not most types of numbers) it
keeps track of percentage of calls from this type of line, to this type of
line, not exact info on which lines.

Looks very nicely done.  I think you pretty much covered it... but...
Even the best cryptographers and security professionals have done this.
RSA did it with their Public Key system, which took 20+ years to break.
Throughout history, many security mechanisms, even the best ones,
including Cyphers, Locks, Firewalls, etc. have been known to go as far as
to offer prizes (some extremely high, upwards of a million dollars, some
as low as RSA's famous $100 prize)

If even that much.  Most of the "permission" i've heard of was infered at
best.  The NSA, nor anybody else, has the _legal_ power to stop you from
putting crypto on the Web, on FTP, or anywere else, so long as you do not
_willingly_ give it to foreign citizens.  If some non-citizen downloads it,
and said they were a US citizen, its not your fault. you THOUGHT you were
giving it to a citizen, which is all the law actually requires.  Of
course, if anybody like Netscape actually had the guts to take this to
court, arguing that ITAR doesn't cover Crypto, the ACLU and other such
would probably back them, and it'd stand a fair chance.  Unfortunatly,
everybody in a position to do this has decided they'd rather not risk
having presidence (sp?) that this _was_ covered under ITAR, of which there
is none.

No, he was right.  They can't prove that their system is unbreakable.
They _might_ be able to prove that their system hasn't been broken, and
they _might_ be able to prove that it is _unlikely_ that it will be, but
they *CAN NOT* prove that it is unbreakable.  This is the nature of
It is impossible to prove such a thing.  It's like saying you have proof
that you have the last car of a certain model ever to be built.  Anybody
could come along and build another, and then you don't have the last one.
There *IS NO SUCH PROOF*.  Just like you can't prove that god created the
universe, or that Oswald shot Kennedy, and so on and so forth.  It can't
be proven.  It never has been proven, and it never will be proven.  People
have new ideas, new algorithms are invented.  Someday, somebody will crack
_all_ the cryptosystems that have now been invented.
Or, better yet, release this "proof", so that we may punch holes in its
flawed logic.

Different ball game.  OTP isn't "unbreakable" .  OTPs are secure because
no matter what key you use, it _will_ decrypt, so your plaintext is still
hidden simply because it could decrypt to whatever the person trying to
decrypt it wants it to.  Its not that its unbreakable, its that its
breakable in _so many ways_.   --Deviant

a) what they're claiming is OTP isn't OTP.  They use algorithmicly

Prove it?  Thats like saying "prove that the sun is bright on a sunny
day".  Its completely obvious.  If somebody has a new idea on how to
attack their algorithm, it might work.  Then the system will have been
broken.  You never know when somebody will come up with a new idea, so the
best you can truthfully say is "it hasn't been broken *YET*".  As I
remember, this was mentioned in more than one respected crypto book,

Well, I was speaking mathematicly (sortof).  When I say "unbreakable", I
mean that you can't figure out the plaintext given only the cyphertext.
In this sence, you can't prove an algorithm "unbreakable", for the reasons
stated *so many times* on this list, and OTP is very very breakable, but
the information you get after breaking it isn't usefull to you.

As I have argued many times, that is correct.  OTP, with real random
numbers, and no-reusage, etc, etc, is the only "perfect" cryptosystem, and
even it has its problems (like key exchange, for instance).
Hrmmm... I seem to see a problem (namely Moore's first law) in assigning
anything a "minimal running time".  Perhaps "minimal instruction count"
would be more suited to your example.  Because if you're talking about
time, it essentially boils down to "the longer something takes the less
time it takes".
Never happen.  It just won't.  As a rule, there's _always_ a faster way.
Ok, now I have to pose a question: If cryptographers actually beleive
this, why continue to search for a faster one.
Again I say, there's _always_ a faster way.
Again I say, it just won't happen.  It can't, and I can't prove that for
the same reasons that it can't happen.
Yes, I must commend you on your amazing tact in asking this incredebly

One the same note, I must say that implimentation of OTP perfectly is
impossible; you can _never_ prove you have truly random numbers.  The
point is that if the numbers are reasonably independant of each other (i
know -- sortof a contradiction) then they are, as you said, good enough.

Well, call it a hunch, but i'd say the first line of cyphertext is "Here
follows a example of the encryption program.  This text file was taken"
Why do i get the feeling whoever did this wasn't very bright?
It is, however, important to note that this isn't just simple
substitution, as shown in the word 'Here', where the cyphertext version is
not 3 characters with 1 repeating.
