URL:    INFOSEC Technical Services Contract The Solution to Your    Needs Now!
   What is INFOSEC
   Information Systems Security (INFOSEC) is defined as the protection of
   information systems against unauthorized access to or modification of
   information, whether in storage, processing or transit, and    the denial of service to authorized users or the provision of service
   to unauthorized user�s, including those measures necessary to detect,
   document, and counter such threats. For operations and for    efficiencies INFOSEC is an enabling feature. It is the discipline that
   protects the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of    information assets and systems. All information is important    valuable to its users and requires some level of protection    unauthorized disclosure (confidentiality), assured access by    (availability), and protection from unauthorized change    We believe that good security is a mission enhancer, not a    detractor! Our overall approach to information systems is security is
   to PROTECT information using a layered defense based on risk
   management and cost benefit analysis. We must be able to monitor all
   our systems and networks in real time to DETECT intrusions or hostile
   actions at all levels, and then REACT to isolate the systems, correct
   the security breach, restore service to the users, and act to prevent
   future attempts.
   Center for Information Systems Security
   Background
   In July 1990, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control,
   Communications, and Intelligence ASD(C3I), started an    effort for coordinated DOD-level management of defense    initiatives. DCA, now DISA, was designated as the lead agency with
   assistance from the National Security Agency (NSA). A DISA/Center for
   Information Systems Security (CISS) and NSA plan was developed and
   approved for establishment of the Defense Information Systems Security
   Program (DISSP).
   CISS has its origin in the Defense Information Systems    Program (DISSP), a joint DISA/NSA program. Continuing as a    program office CISS�s mission is to manage, coordinate and    direct INFOSEC application support to DOD programs, develop    and protocols for INFOSEC and expedite the implementation of    command, control and communications systems for DOD. The CISS provides
   a means to fully review, coordinate, and make    concerning the implementation of policy, architecture, and products to
   support DOD objectives.
   Mission
   The Center for Information Systems Security (CISS) is a joint DISA/NSA
   organization charged with executing the centrally managed    Information Warfare (IW-D) and INFOSEC functions within DOD.
   CISS is the focal point for assuring availability, integrity, and
   confidentiality of all DII systems and information. We provide direct
   support to DOD services and agencies, and define requirements for DII
   INFOSEC standards. Additionally, CISS provides central    and reporting response to all DOD INFOSEC incidents, and    protection, detection, reaction, and vulnerability analysis to the
   DII.
   What is the INFOSEC Technical Services Contract?
   DISA awarded the INFOSEC Technical Services Contract (INFOSEC TSC) on
   12 July 1995 to two large businesses (CSC and SAIC) and one    business (MERDAN Group, Inc.). CISS, a joint DISA/National    Agency (NSA) program, has been chartered to provide INFOSEC    throughout DoD. INFOSEC support will be provided by CISS
   infrastructure resources with contractual assistance from the INFOSEC
   TSC. The primary responsibility of the joint program office is to
   assure the effective and coherent application of INFOSEC to    overall Defense Information Infrastructure (DII).
   The contract offers technical support in the areas of:
     * INFOSEC Security Policy
     * INFOSEC Requirements Support
     * INFOSEC Architecture and Engineering
     * INFOSEC Independent Validation and Applications      * INFOSEC Products and Applications DoD Goal Security        (DGSA)
     * INFOSEC Certification and Accreditation Master Transition Plan
     * INFOSEC Technology and Training Documentation, and        Information Dissemination
     * INFOSEC Multilevel Security Technology
     * INFOSEC Technical Managemet and Capabilities Planning      * INFOSEC ProfessionalizationProgram and Project      * INFOSEC Standards and Protocols
   The contract is not a Federal Information Processing (FIP) hardware or
   software procurement contract.
   All DOD departments and agencies requiring INFOSEC services    utilize the INFOSEC TSC. The contracts are Indefinite    Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with individual firm fixed price, cost plus
   fixed fee, and time and material Delivery Orders (DOs) awarded for
   each requirement. Ceiling on the INFOSEC TSC is $1.095B which includes
   authority for other Federal (non-DOD) Agency use of 10% of    contract value. An additional 10% authority for non-DOD    agencies is anticipated from GSA. There will be a 2 percent    applied to all Delivery Orders.
   Details for submitting requirements are spelled out in the �Guide for
   the INFOSEC TSC.

@_subject: [reformatted] how secure can privasoft be? 
heres a version with eighty character lines:
How Secure Can PrivaSoft Be?
PrivaSoft is a communication security product, and the user is entitled to
know how secure it is.  This document addresses the question of cryptographic strength of PrivaSoft.
Export license regulations
In some advanced countries, cryptographic products are categorized as "munitions" and their use, sale or exportation is controlled by local licensing regulations.  PrivaSoft has obtained an export license from the governments of Israel and the USA.  Licenses in other countries are obtained in coordination with the local distributors.  The typical policy is to limit the allowable cryptographic strength of commercial products to a level that is strong enough for commercial purposes.  The basic intention of this regulation is to protect the state from abuse of too strong cryptographic products by terrorists and criminals.  Some countries
do not practice such law because it is viewed as a denial of freedom of expression.  PrivaSoft willfully complies with these regulations as it is a commercial product, and it is not intended for national security applications with its current key length which is the maximum legally allowable for commercial users.
The cryptographic engine of PrivaSoft
PrivaSoft uses a pseudo-random generator that is seeded by a 9 digit number uniformly normalized from the user's secret key.  The engine is proprietary, designed according to the rules of modern cryptology to make the best use of the allowable key length.
Like other dependable cryptographic engines, the structure of the encryption software can be disclosed without compromising the security of the user.  However, the coding and specific parameters of the mechanism are considered a trade secret and will be disclosed for the purpose of cryptoanalytic validation when necessary and under an appropriate non-disclosure non-
competition agreement.
The use of default keys
When secret keys or passwords are used by laymen, there is always a conflict between security and convenience:  The user tends to use fixed, easily memorized keys again and again, while the cryptoanalyst only waits for an opportunity to see many messages encrypted by the same key.  PrivaSoft, being a secure commercial product must live in peace with both - allow the user to use a repetitive, default key, and deny the cryptoanalyst the pleasure of having many messages encrypted by one key.  This is done by using the pseudo-
random "key extension" feature which is described in the PrivaSoft user's The information contents a clear message
If a cryptographic product is properly designed, then the almost only way to crack it is to try all possible keys.  If the process is done by a computer, the "cracking"" software must be taught to tell the correct key from the wrong keys.  This can only be done if there are some properties of the decrypted message that are known a - priori.  With the PrivaSoft analogue graphical encryption, and with the naturally noisy fax images, a significant portion of the page must be reconstructed, and a significant amount of mathematical correlation must be calculated between neighboring areas of the image, before the cracking software can tell whether the candidate key is wrong.  This makes the cracking process much slower than in alphanumeric encryption of the text in a natural language.  The 9 digit key, when applied to analogue, the graphical encryption is equivalent to a much longer key applied to alphanumeric encryption.  The cryptographically oriented user can make it very much harder by some smart pre-processing of the image prior to its encryption.  A simple example:  For a short message, increasing the font size of the text by a factor of 10 will significantly increase the time required for breaking the encryption.
Customized versions of PrivaSoft
PrivaSoft is unique in being a one-stop product than can serve all types of modern correspondence, including E-mail, fax and paper printouts.  Special applications that need and can obtain a license to use non-commercial cryptographic engines can be accommodated by special versions of PrivaSoft.  The cryptographic engine can be customer-furnished and customer integrated, however - since in some areas the integration of this product with certain cryptographic engines may be considered "munitions", each customized version of the product has to be licensed separately in accordance with the laws of the territory where it was created and used.

Scientist urges action on Internet pornography
By Clive Cookson
Pornography accounts for about half of non-academic use of the
Internet, the global computer network, the British Association
science conference heard yesterday.
Prof Harold Thimbleby, professor of computing research at
Middlesex University, said most parents, politicians and
educators had no idea how easy it was to find graphic
descriptions of horrific perversions, through any personal
computer linked to the net.
"If you want to know about any perversion, you can find full
details," Prof Thimbleby said, "and they are described in
deceitful and evil ways."
He was particularly upset by Internet porn sites that
masquerade as victim support groups, such as those for child
abuse that tell paedophiles how to entrap children. "I have
found text, film and sound material that I find extremely
disturbing, for example instructions for killing minors for
sexual gratification."
Prof Thimbleby has been researching the pattern of traffic on
the Internet since the beginning of the year.
It is impossible to monitor how more than a tiny fraction of
the estimated 30m to 40m users utilise the net. But Prof
Thimbleby analysed a representative sample of "bulletin
boards" and of searches made via so-called "web crawlers"
which act like telephone directories for the World Wide Web,
the fastest growing part of the Internet.
He said his conclusion - that pornography accounted for about
50 per cent of the searches - tallied with recent US findings
about the dominance of porn on the net.
"There is no reliable way, technical or otherwise, to detect
or intercept pornography," Prof Thimbleby said.
Censorship of the Internet was impossible, because
pornographers could easily disguise their material. And
censoring programs such as SurfWatch and Internet Filter could
not cope with all the fast-changing pornographic material.
Because censorship was technically and politically
impractical, Prof Thimbleby suggested that a better response
was to dilute the pornography with other material.
"The Internet has very little interesting material for the
non-specialist user. It needs more," he said. "When it has
more, it is just possible that pornography will slip into its
statistically appropriate place, one aspect of humanity but
not the most prominent on the Internet."

FBI Probes Slant Allegations
Washington, September 14, 1995 (AP) -- The FBI says it
has reviewed more than 250 cases involving work done by
its crime lab after one of its agents alleged that his
colleagues slanted their testimony and fabricated
evidence to help prosecutors in high-profile cases.
"To date, no evidence tampering, evidence fabrication or
failure to report exculpatory evidence have been found,"
the FBI said in a statement Wednesday. "Any findings of
such misconduct will result in tough and swift action by
the FBI."
Special Agent Frederic Whitehurst, who made the
allegations and was interviewed Wednesday night on
ABC-TV's "Primetime Live" program, labeled the FBI
statement "garbage."
"I am obviously disagreeing with my superiors in this
matter. This report is garbage. ... It's garbage. I
personally know about the review of those 250 cases,"
Whitehurst said.
Whitehurst said he was under orders not to discuss
specific cases.
Defense lawyers want to call Whitehurst as a witness at
the O.J. Simpson murder trial in Los Angeles because he
has claimed that FBI agent Roger Martz, who gave
testimony damaging to Simpson, has slanted evidence in
testimony in other cases.
Asked if there had been evidence tampering at the FBI
lab, Whitehurst told ABC, "Yes, I believe there has been
evidence tampering."
He said he would testify at the Simpson trial "if the FBI
orders me to go."
Martz could not be reached for comment. There was no
answer at the office phones either Martz or Whitehurst
late Wednesday. Their home phone numbers could not be be
The FBI said Whitehurst had, over the past several years,
raised "a variety of concerns about forensic protocols
and procedures employed in the FBI Laboratory," and that
the bureau or the inspector general's office of the
Justice Department, or both, had "vigorously
investigated" his concerns in all instances and were
continuing to do so.
The FBI said its laboratory examinations at trials are
"constantly subject to extraordinarily vigorous challenge
through cross-examination and the presentation of expert
testimony by defense witnesses."
Whitehurst told ABC he was speaking out because it was
his duty as an FBI agent.
"I swore to uphold the constitution of the United States,
and I swore to enforce the law. There was no caveat in
that swearing -- if I caught persons with badges I would
turn my back. I am an FBI agent. It's my duty," he said.
Whitehurst testified last month at the terrorism trial of
Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and nine other Muslims accused of
plotting to bomb the United Nations building and other
New York City landmarks that he was pressured to distort
findings about the 1993 World Trade Center bombing to
favor prosecutors.
Citing a series of internal memos sent by Whitehurst to
his FBI supervisors, ABC said the agent listed "one
example after another of what he calls perjury, fraud,
even the fabrication of evidence" in cases at the crime
lab going back at least five years.
One of the cases, ABC said, involved a 1991 Georgia
mail-bombing that killed a federal judge and a civil
rights lawyer. It was investigated by Louis Freeh, now
the FBI director. Walter LeRoy Moody Jr. was convicted in
the deaths.
ABC said Whitehurst alleges that two agents in that case,
one of whom was Martz, slanted evidence by testifying
about tests that weren't done and scientific conclusions
they couldn't support.
The FBI lab was used to analyze blood evidence involving
Simpson. Martz, a toxicologist, was called by the
defense, but was declared a hostile witness. He testified
that blood on a sock from Simpson's bedroom and from the
crime scene showed only vague signs of a preservative.
Simpson's lawyers say the blood was planted and the
presence of the preservative proved it.
While testifying in New York Aug. 14, Whitehurst said
Martz was among several FBI investigators who concluded
the World Trade Center bomb was urea-nitrate-based even
though it was impossible to prove that scientifically
because the substance is so common.
After Whitehurst complained to his superiors, he said,
reports about the bomb were corrected. He said they were
accurate when they were introduced at last year's World
Trade Center trial, which resulted in convictions for
followers of Abdel-Rahman.
At the terror conspiracy trial, Whitehurst said when he
first told his supervisor about the errors, the
supervisor "advised us that he would now have to
embarrass his chemistry toxicology unit chief and that we
were never, ever again to do something like that to him."
Later, Whitehurst said, the supervisor told him he had
been instructed by his bosses to have Whitehurst change
his reports, and debates within the FBI about the
evidence continued throughout the year.
Whitehurst, the FBI's main explosives-residue analyst at
the time of the bombing, said he has since been demoted
and assigned to analyze paint for forensic evidence.

Or related to the NYT spin today on LEA-web-snooping:
   "We are not going to permit exciting new technology to be
   misused to exploit and injure children," Attorney General
   Janet Reno said today in announcing the arrests.
   The culmination of the inquiry by the Federal Bureau of
   Investigatlon comes at a time when the agency has needed
   some favorable attention to offset a string of incidents
   that have cast it in a negative light. Its officials have
   come under fire for their role in the siege at Waco, Tex.,
   the standoff with a white separatist in Idaho and, most
   recently, over an attempt to cover up aspects in the Idaho
   incident.
Or diversion from the allegations of Special Agent Whitehurst
that Feeb lab rats and bosses are corrupt -- tar-morphing even

   conserver la possibilit� pour la police de suivre les �changes. On
   notera que la plupart des pays comparables � la France autorisent le
   chiffrement, comme le montre l' excellente enqu�te de Sylvain Andr�
   (vous pouvez voir aussi l'�tude du gouvernement am�ricain).
   Le logiciel de chiffrement le plus connu est PGP (Pretty    Privacy). Gratuit, assez simple � utiliser, tr�s efficace,    document�, tournant sur de nombreuses plate-formes (Unix,    Macintosh), c'est un excellent outil pour l'utilisateur. Il semble que
   son autorisation en France soit hors de question. Notez que, si vous
   voulez utiliser PGP en France, vous avez deux obstacles successifs :
    1. PGP est interdit d'exportation par les Etats-Unis. Il faut donc
       r�cup�rer une des (nombreuses) versions sur un serveur
       non-am�ricain.
    2. Le chiffrement est soumis � autorisation en France. Voir
       ci-dessus.
   Certaines personnes trouvent qu'un autre obstacle � l'utilisation de
   PGP est la difficult� d'utilisation. Celles-ci peuvent lire    remarquable livre de Garfinkel :
   Simson Garfinkel
   PGP ; Pretty Good Privacy
   O'Reilly & associates
   ISBN 1-56592-098-8
   Et il existe d'autres pr�sentations de PGP comme celle    Robert (fichiers PostScript PGP.*.ps), qui existe aussi sous    d'un serveur Web.
   PGP prot�ge des fichiers, soit lors de leur transmission sur le r�seau
   (par courrier �lectronique ou autre m�thode), soit en local.    logiciels prot�gent, par exemple les connexions � distance ou le
   syst�me de fen�trage X ( SSH assure ces deux fonctions). Visitez le
   service Web "International Cryptography Pages" pour avoir tous les

Cylink Claims Right To Key Technology Involving
Sunnyvale, Calif. - A Silicon Valley company asserted a
legal claim to a key technology for protecting electronic
commerce, following an arbitration ruling.
Closely held Cylink Corp. said the ruling gave back to
the company control over two key Stanford University
patents regarding public-key encryption, a technique for
scrambling data from theft or eavesdropping. A panel of
three arbitrators, asked to settle a dispute between
Cylink and RSA Data Security Inc., dissolved a five-year
partnership between the two that pooled their encryption
RSA, a closely held company based in Redwood City,
Calif., is the dominant supplier of encryption software,
with users that include Microsoft Corp., Novell Inc.,
Netscape Communications Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and
International Business Machines Corp. The arbitrators
ruled that RSA hasn't had the right to sublicense the
Stanford patents since 1990.
Cylink said it would seek royalties from companies that
have licensed software code from RSA and are
redistributing it, arguing that they are infringing the
Stanford patents.

NY Times, Sept 21, 1995.
Fraud Can Flourish Without the Internet
To the Editor:
Your Sept. 19 front-page article on the discovery by two
University of California graduate students of a flaw in
Netscape, the software used for purchases over the Internet's
World Wide Web, raises a number of obvious questions.
First, who needs high tech to perpetrate fraud? Any
unscrupulous commercial employee could use or sell your credit
card number without employing technology.
Every time you hand your card to a waiter in a restaurant, it
disappears for several minutes. The department store clerks
and gas station attendants you deal with also have access to
your card number. How secure is that?
Ever give your credit card number over the phone to make a
purchase from a mail-order house? Or to secure a reservation
at a hotel? Who's to say that the employees you're speaking
with are honest? Or that your phone is not tapped? Or theirs?
I shop on the Internet; I may get ripped off. What's my
liability? Fifty bucks -- same as the other scenarios I've
described. That's in my credit agreement with the card issuer.
So why all the hoopla? Is credit card fraud significantly more
prevalent on the Internet than in other modes of purchasing?
Or is the banking industry whipping up hysteria among
purchasers to curb fraud losses? Was the work of those
graduate students funded by someone -- directly or indirectly?
If so, by whom? A banking consortium? A high-tech company
working on some patentable security scheme?

                          "SAIC 25 YEARS OF PROGRESS"
   Founded by a small group of San Diego scientists in 1969,    Applications International Corporation (SAIC) now ranks as    nation's largest employee-owned high-tech company. With    revenues of $1.6 billion, SAIC has almost 4,000 employees in    Diego, and about 16,000 employees at more than 250 locations
   worldwide.
    SAIC offers broad expertise in technology development and    computer system development and integration, technical    services, and computer hardware and software products. SAIC    and engineers work to solve complex technical problems in    areas that include environment, energy, health, transportation and
   space.
    Since the beginning, SAIC has been committed to making    contributions to nationally important programs. Over the past two
   decades, SAIC technical staff have contributed to clean-up efforts at
   Three Mile Island and Prince William Sound, to the success    Operation Desert Storm, and to space missions ranging from Voyager to
   the shuttle flights. The company is helping develop new technology to
   clean up hazardous waste at Superfund sites, while other    are studying global climate and oceanographic changes. In    critical area, SAIC is increasing the quality of patient care while
   lowering costs by developing an automated patient record system for
   Department of Defense medical facilities.
    Today, SAIC generates about 90 percent of its business    federal government contracts, half of which are in the    security area. The company has been transitioning its    experience in advanced defense systems and software engineering to
   benefit civilian programs. For example, SAIC networking    helps dozens of government agencies share information to fight drug
   smuggling, and integrates technology that has put a pollution-free bus
   on the road.
    Bob Beyster, SAIC's founder and chief executive officer, credits the
   success of the company to its employee ownership.
    "The hallmark of SAIC through the years has been the principle that
   those who contribute to the company should own it, with that    proportional to their contribution and performance as much    possible," Beyster says, "SAIC was designed for professional    who want to do superior scientific and technical work, who want to
   have a stake and a voice in the company's development and    and who expect fair rewards for doing excellent work."

   SAIC SHOWS CRIME-FIGHTING TECHNOLOGY
   (SAN DIEGO, CA) March 17, 1995 -- Illegal contraband hidden in trucks,
   boats and airplanes can be detected with the assistance of
   state-of-the-art technology developed by Science    International Corporation (SAIC).
    The portable system is being demonstrated Friday as part of    opening of the federal Border Research and Technology Center at the
   Otay Mesa port-of-entry. The center, which has been    through the efforts of San Diego U.S. Attorney Alan D. Bersin, will be
   the focal point for driving the design, development, manufacture and
   acquisition of specialized law-enforcement technologies. The center is
   expected to identify specific programs for development that could be
   used by a variety of law-enforcement agencies.
   Various technologies for fighting cross-border crime will be
   demonstrated during a mock Otay border crossing by a driver    to evade the law.
   San Diego-based SAIC's portable contraband detection system    inaccessible areas such as wheel wells, bumpers, boat hulls    aircraft fuselages. The system uses a micro-processor, a
   self-contained low-level radioactive sources and a sensitive    As surfaces are scanned, concealed objects including    narcotics, alcohol and explosives reflect the radiation, which is
   sensed by the detector.
   The system operator is alerted by both a backlit digital    visible in all light conditions, and an audio beeper that increases in
   rate as the contraband is detected. The handheld system's total weight
   is about two pounds.
   SAIC also will show how vehicles can be "tagged" by radio    which can provide positive identification of cars, trucks or    passing through a specific area. Already in use by several
   SAIC-equipped automated toll collection systems across the U.S, the
   transponders or "tags" are issued to specific vehicles. Attached to
   bumpers or placed on dashboards, the tags are read as the    passes near an antenna installed over or at the side of the    The signal is displayed on a computer screen, and the data is stored
   and available for further use.
   The system could be used to speed commuters or other    vehicles regularly crossing the border. Violators can be    because the "smart" system senses when a vehicle crosses without a
   tag, and can trigger alarms, crossing gates or other barriers, as well
   as recording the violator on video tape. Operators can    enhance license plate photos to be read clearly and process
   enforcement action.
   "We at SAIC are encouraged by the opening of the Border    Technology Center today. This Center will provide the opportunity to
