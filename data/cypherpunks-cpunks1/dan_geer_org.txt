Speaking for myself, when a government can no longer protect
its citizens, its last duty is to arm them.

Exactly correct.  90+% of US critical infrastructure is in private
hands.  With each passing day Internet-dependent services become
more essential to what I will for the moment call "normal life."
The USG's response to the growing pervasiveness of Internet services
held in private hands is deputize the owners of those services
against their will.  The entire imbroglio around ISPs, the NSA, and
so forth and so on comes down to that -- if the government does not
itself own the critical infrastructure, those that do own it can

of conscripts.

Those considered hard right and those considered hard left have never
been closer in outlook, never had greater congruence between their
lists of what to overturn.  Once it is both ends against the middle,
you enter a pre-revolutionary state.  That is what we have now --
growing flanks versus a contracting middle.  It is middle class that
is shrinking; it is the middle of the country that is depopulating;
the political middle is where "only the lonely" live; both farms

journalism is now advocacy journalism; middle-tier college education
is a ticket to debt and nothing else; etc.

Au contraire, Monsieur, beaucoup d'argent.
Thinking out loud, if Quality Software Services was selected
for this most visible effort, then they must have a track
record with Federal agencies.
And they do (read, they're wired).  One (only) example:
  Quality Software Services, Inc. Wins $109.93 Million Federal Contract
  for Medicare and Medicaid Services
  Jun 20 12
  Quality Software Services, Inc. won a federal contract valued at
  up to $109,926,956 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human
  Services' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Baltimore,
  for enterprise identity management services under the American
  Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
So they are in the identity management services game, which
means that they already have your number, so to speak.  And
are pre-existing contractors to Health & Human Services.
Yet more searching discovers that all the key management
personnel have TS clearances, but the firm seems to never
have had TS contracts, so one can argue that the clearances
were gifts for friends.
This is a rat hole...

Au contraire, Monsieur, beaucoup d'argent.
Thinking out loud, if Quality Software Services was selected
for this most visible effort, then they must have a track
record with Federal agencies.
And they do (read, they're wired).  One (only) example:
  Quality Software Services, Inc. Wins $109.93 Million Federal Contract
  for Medicare and Medicaid Services
  Jun 20 12
  Quality Software Services, Inc. won a federal contract valued at
  up to $109,926,956 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human
  Services' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Baltimore,
  for enterprise identity management services under the American
  Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
So they are in the identity management services game, which
means that they already have your number, so to speak.  And
are pre-existing contractors to Health & Human Services.
Yet more searching discovers that all the key management
personnel have TS clearances, but the firm seems to never
have had TS contracts, so one can argue that the clearances
were gifts for friends.
This is a rat hole...

@_subject: [cryptography] NIST Randomness Beacon 
After all that discussion of the randomness beacon, it belatedly
occurs to me to ask if anyone has ever applied, even for fun, any
of the various tests for randomness to the transmissions from the
various shortwave "numbers stations."
