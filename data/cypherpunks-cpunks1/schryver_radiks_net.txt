No there is a major difference, I feel society is served best when
each individual has the freedom to defend and protect themselves apposed
to what you want us to do in essence you want us to lay down those liberties to an outsied group who are supposed to protect us.  The internet is not a city, it is a computer network that
spans the globe.  What you are asking for in analogy is not a cop walking
a city street but fucking U.N. tanks driving through neiborhoods enforcing
rights by way of brute force. law enforcement in your techniques and attacks on others.  Often unwarranted
and justified in the name of some supposed higher ideal.

Sorry about mangling quotes. :(
This was about a year and a half ago.
I can't remember the name of it,  but this chip fab industry mag was
talking about how the NSA was obtaining out side help in fabricating what
was at the time a type of ram that did processing off chip in parrallel.
If the chip was basically routing the problem to different sectors and
the same sectors of ram did their own processing on different parts of the same problem how many powers of processing time would this increase the same amount of acerage?* * NSA term for processing. Side note: Wired just recently talked about IRAM or Intelligent ram, and how it seems to be the future of high speed computation.

NBC News at Sunrise has just announced the discovery of alien life on the planet Mars.  The lifeform that became extinct more than 2 billion years
ago was found as a fossil in a meteor that originated from mars and landed
on earth.  The fossil found was a primitive germ life form.

Since metal blocks the waves and stands out on the screen one could affectively
block its use by putting up a fine metal mesh on the interior of all walls that are exterior to the house.  The same could be said for clothing that looks normal but has a metal mesh liner, like say a trench coat.

Uh logos... Deal with it.  If I needed some one to walk me through a mailing list when it concerns constructive arguements I'd be requesting a moderated
list and since I find moderated news groups to be nonproductive affairs I tend
to find this mailing list perfect for my needs.  As for judging if Tim has advanced the arguement or not that is for each person to decide not you.

Should kids have crypto? [weapons]
Should parents teach their kids crypto at an early age?
Should kids have a right to privacy?
        If yes, should there be a limit to the privacy they hold?
Under Itar crypto is a weapon.  If a kid were to bring a disk
containing pgp to school could they be expelled for carrying a weapon?
Should children's legal rights be taught at school at an early age?

Talked with Randy of Safe Mail Corporation on the phone.  Among the stuff he claimed was that
        PGP has the secret key in its public key!
        Found out that not only does this algorithm use 22 characters.          The characters are the ones only found on the keyboard.
        SafeMail uses a proprietary Russian algorithm.
Not only is this company misquoting it's making up as it goes along. :)

Strange how religion and monetary markets work.
They both demand the suspension of fact and or physical items in favor of
some ethereal object or person's view of reality.
I'm not saying that the dollar is some object that does not physically exist,
I'm just saying that the value inherent is no longer based on a physical item.
Question. If e-cash were backed by gold would that make it more reliable than say the dollar?  PGP encrypted mail preferred.  Scott J. Schryvers -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
