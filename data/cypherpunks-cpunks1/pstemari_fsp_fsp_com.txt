@_subject: backing ecash 
Isn't there a problem with net-based distribution of ecash?  It would
seem that Eve could intercept the ecash and spend it first.  Encrypted
email return of the ecash would seem to violate the anonymity of the
ecash.  Some sort of one-time encrypted return address would seem to
be necessary, but better yet would be a vending machine that took a
floppy disk and some currency and stuck the ecash on the floppy.

Something like this should be fairly reasonable to implement in C++.
The basic concept would be to have a single public abstract class with
a static method that takes a protocol name and returns a pointer to an
encryption engine object that implements that protocol.  The actual
classes could either register themselves with the base class
statically at link time or dynamically via DLL's or equivalent and an
OS dependent config utility.
The biggest question to my mind is how to handle key management and
whether the engines should require blocks of an appropriate size (eg
encrypt(size_t blksize, const char *inbuf, char *outbuf)) or act as
pumps with user-specified data sources and sinks (eg encrypt(istream&
input, ostream& output)).

As OLE becomes more popular, this will be a bigger problem.  It's
quite possible to stick a nasty macro in an MS Word document that will
get executed when the Word document is opened for viewed.

Heh.  You mean, I assume, that such a device would, when worn by an
officer in court, essentially become a broadcast polygraph?  It would
also provide an interesting check in wrongful force cases as to
whether a cop really was in fear of his life at a given time.

My point was that essentially a (broadcast of vital signs) ==
(broadcast of polygraph).  There's some stuff that's different, but I
don't think that it's sufficient to make a real difference.
What your friends are current working on implementing, of course, is
not (yet) to this point.

What precisely would be the point of anonymously ordering PIS's (I
like that name!)?  You'd need some mechanism for anon delivery of
physical goods, unless of course what was transmitted was a recipe and
your computer was hooked up to a organic synthesis lab.

Actually, the emulation libraries will generally use the FPU if one is
available.  The Windows one runs as a DLL as I recall.

For magentic media, which includes core :), I believe the standard is
overwriting the info alternately with 0's and 1's 100x.
