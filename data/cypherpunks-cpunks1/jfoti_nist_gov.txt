@_subject: Update on NIST crypto standards 
Here is a brief update on NIST's crypto standards efforts:
1.  On January 5, 2001, we announced a Draft FIPS for HMAC (Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code) that is a generalization of HMAC as specified in Internet RFC 2104 and ANSI X9.71.  A 90-day public comment period ends April 5, 2001.  Details are available at .
2.  On January 2, 2001, we posted a white paper that discusses our plans for developing standards and recommendations for public key-based key management.  This will be a two-part process, involving the development of 1) a scheme definition document, and 2) a key management guideline.  This paper is available at .
3.  The Draft FIPS for the AES is anticipated for release for public review in the very near future.  Final approvals for the release of this document are pending.  When an announcement is made, information on the draft and for providing public comments will be available at .
Best regards and Happy New Year,
[This note is being sent to those people who have attended any of NIST's AES conferences, the Key Management Standard (KMS) workshop in February 2000, the Modes of Operation workshop in October 2000, or who have expressed other interest in our efforts.  If you would not like to receive similar notices in the future (which should be infrequent), please let me know, and we will remove you from our email distribution list.]
