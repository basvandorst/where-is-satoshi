Enabling this option will allow you to mount a file as a file system.
  This is useful if you want to check an ISO9660 file system before
  burning the CD, or want to use floppy images without first writing
  them to floppy.
  This option also allows one to mount a filesystem with encryption.
  To use these features, you need a recent version of mount, such as
  the one found at ftp.win.tue.nl:/pub/linux/util/mount-2.5X.tar.gz.
  If you want to use encryption, you might also be interested in the
  (old) DES package ftp.funet.fi:/pub/OS/Linux/BETA/loop/des.1.tar.gz.
  Note that this loop device has nothing to do with the loopback
  device used for network connections from the machine to itself.
  Most users will answer N here.
