@_subject: "Wired" has more than one cover--why? (fwd) 
They decided that West Coast covers should feature Peter Gabriel and the
East Coast covers Mitch Kapor.  Something about rock and roll playing
better on newsstands than policy everywhere but the Northeasteast corridor.
 All subscribers got the Gabriel cover.
As the Wired editor told me this split cover was a last minute decision and
a first-time experiment.  The Cypherpunks were on the cover all of copies
of issue

Announcement suitable for reposting.  Please pass this around all the usual
On Thursday, November 25th, the Nightly Business Report, which is broadcast
nationally on PBS, will feature a Thanksgiving Day special on "The
Informationm Highway".  Guests include Ray Smith, CEO of Bell-Atlantic, and
Mitch Kapor of EFF. Check local listings for times.  I taped this yesterday and think it will be worth watching.
Mitchell Kapor, Chairman                    Electronic Frontier Foundation               *** Join EFF!!!  Send mail to membership at eff.org for information ***
