Dear Cypherpunks:
I write for the New York Times Magazine. My editor wants to profile, as he put it, "a group of hackers who've gone legit" and now do consulting for corporations. Paul Kocher of Cryptography Research thought you guys might have a couple suggestions. He
mentioned a co-op in Boston, but couldn't recall their
name. Also -- anyone know what Robert Morris Jr. is up
to? Or how to contact him? Thanks very much.
Mary Roach
