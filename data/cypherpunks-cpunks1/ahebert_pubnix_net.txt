@_subject: About private networks (Was Re: NYT covers China cyberthreat) 
( Well I'm sure that there is a few hundrends of paper on this subject )
    I have a few ideas but it involve:
         .Dark Fiber;
        . All devices at FIPS 140 level;
        . Tonnes of resin;
        . Wire mesh;
        . Fiber DB monitoring;
        . Cable Shield monitoring;
        . Single Encryption Key injection for the FIPS 140 devices;
        . Central Provisioning;
        . Kill switch for suspected segments;
    And a private fab because it would not be a good idea to
sub-contract that to lets says... some Chinese outfit =D
    TLDR: Feasable, hella costly.
    PS:
    Enjoy this week end of the world news.
