to, but I need to know what ports Telnet uses for standard use.  Mainly, I implemented the Telnet bouncer program that was posted here a while back, and when trying to connect to hosts that don't require a port number it still asks me for one.
bouncer, it asks me for a port number.  When I use my standard Telnet program it will connect with just archie.sura.net as the address.  Does anybody know a site where I can find this info?  Thanx in advance and my apologies for any waste of bandwidth!
