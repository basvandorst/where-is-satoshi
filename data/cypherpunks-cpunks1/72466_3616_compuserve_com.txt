Can someone repost the email address for the White House.  I seem to have
misplaced my copy.  :(

@_subject: Remailer Abuse? 
Is someone using my remailer to send trash to innocent young girls?
I am uncomfortable to be facilitating this kind of activity.  Can anyone
offer suggestions for the ethical thing to do in this situation?
You didn't say but I assume from the context that your remailer is anonymous. If that is the case, then you have a decision to make.  You can either keep
your remailer anonymous and not be concerned about what goes thru it or you can
make it a moderated list so that you become responsible for everything that is
posted.  Which way do you want it?

@_subject: party... 
she would like to see some new faces at this party (not just the
berkeley regulars)
Does this mean that all cypherpunks live in driving distance of Berkeley?  If
so, I guess I'd better unsubscribe fast since I live in Hawaii.  Be a bit of
drive from there, eh?
