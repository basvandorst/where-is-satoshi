What I find most annoying about police entrapment is the damage to
children these police offers are responsible for.  Bob Matthews who heads
up the anti child porn squad in ontario spends most of his days raiding
the homes of potential child molesters who turn out to be kids.  Alot of
kids pretend to be much older when online and they end up being targeted
by these perverted law enforment twits who end up sending them filth
and effectively convencing our kids that this sort of thing is good.  They
are becoming the problem.

COMPUTERGRAM INTERNATIONAL: NOVEMBER 03 2000
+ Vint Cerf Says Security Crucial to Internet's Future
Vinton Cerf, one of the few men who can claim to be credited
with being the "father of the internet", yesterday warned that
security needs to tighten up in most areas if the internet is
to fully achieve its potential. Cerf, WorldCom Inc's senior
vice president of internet architecture and technology, made
his plea for tighter security at the Compsec2000 International
conference in London, UK yesterday.
Cerf, who is perhaps best known as the co-designer of the web's
TCP/IP protocols, outlined numerous areas where security could
be improved. He named cryptographic technology, network
security, host security and internet-enabled appliances among
the main candidates where improvements are needed.
First on Cerf's hit list is the problem of cryptography. Cerf
pointed to the need for a universally adopted non-proprietary
standard. While the US National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) has now accepted the Rijndael algorithm of
Belgian researchers Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen as its sole
candidate for standardization, the search for alternative
standards in both Japan and Europe threatens the possibility of
a unified approach, he said.
Cerf also criticized the slow rate of adoption of public key
infrastructure (PKI) in the public and cross enterprise arenas,
and argued strongly for the separation of identification and
authentication. Identity, he said, should just be a means of
declaring oneself for validation. Registering should not itself
confer authority. That should be left to individual entities
based on their own database rather than centralizing all
knowledge of individuals.
Cerf said there is a also a need for multiple public and
private keys to avoid people using others' public keys as
identifiers. He also argued that global verification standards
may need to relinquished in favor of using different methods
for individuals, enterprises and governments.
In terms of network security, Cerf said the internet protocol
security (IPSec) standard is well specified, giving hosts the
chance to defend themselves, but there is still a need to adopt
a common key distribution process and firewalls that defend
against internal threats. He also said there is a need for
end-to-end encryption in VPNs in order to prevent any danger
from packet leaks into other networks.
Host security is also critical, especially in a world of
increasingly distributed systems. Cerf said internal firewalls
within operating systems may be needed to overcome their
inherent security weaknesses. He also advocated mutual and
continuous authentication between devices to prevent hijacking
of IP addresses and active monitoring, for instance for virus
detection and trojan horse signatures.
Within the distributed world, internet-enabled appliances, such
as the much-hyped internet refrigerator, are likely to form the
next target for hackers, he said. As such, he said that
authentication is needed for secure device control from the net
to stop, say, the kid next door reprogramming your house while
you are away. The profusion of such devices, enabled by putting
IP into hardware, will also quickly put a strain on IP address
space, he said.

ACLU Press Release: 11-02-00 -- ACLU Charges Political Censorship,
Challenges CA's Shutdown of Votexchange.com
   ACLU Charges Political Censorship, Challenges CA's Shutdown of
   Thursday, November 2, 2000
   LOS ANGELES  The ACLU affiliates of Southern California and San Diego
   announced today that they will seek a temporary restraining order against
   California Secretary of State Bill Jones, who threatened criminal
   against a voter discussion and strategizing web site called Voteswap 2000.
   As a result of a letter Jones sent to Voteswap, that web site and two
   including the ACLU client votexchange2000.com, decided to shut down this
   rather than run the risk of being prosecuted. The ACLU is also filing the
   lawsuit on behalf of a prospective voter. The National Voting Rights Project
   joins the ACLU as co-counsel in the case.
   "Votexchange2000 and other similar web sites have a clear political
   said Peter Eliasberg, staff attorney at the ACLU of Southern California,
   that qualifies them for the highest level of protection under the First
   Amendment, whether or not Secretary Jones approves of their message or aim."
   "Jones's interpretation of this statute is so far-reaching," he added, "that
   it could encompass a vast array of voting-related behavior and speech
which we
   all recognize as perfectly legitimate, even if we don't practice them
   ourselves."
   The vote discussion and matching sites sprang up as early as October 1, and
   several were launched recently in response to an on-line opinion piece
   advocating that voters get together on-line and strategize about how to
   accomplish their shared aims. Scores of thousands of potential voters have
   visited the sites since they were launched.
   Republican Secretary of State Bill Jones cracked down on the innovative
   discussion of voting strategies, claiming that sites which host and
   such discussions violate California's Election Code � 18521, which prohibits
   offering payment or any other "valuable consideration" to people so that
   will or will not vote.
   ACLU attorneys say the law is not applicable, or, if construed to be
   applicable, that it is not, in that case, Constitutionally sound.
   "Discussing and agreeing to a co-operative voting strategy is absolutely
   distinct from offering or receiving payment for a vote," said Eliasberg.
   is not equivalent to handing someone a five-dollar bill -- it is an
   unenforceable and unverifiable personal pledge to vote in a certain way."
   "Jones's interpretation of this law could conceivably qualify any kind of
   speech as an inducement," he added. "If I promise to commend a person for
   voting in a way I approve of, is that offering an inducement?"
   Eliasberg offered the following examples of voting-related behavior and
   that Jones's interpretation of the law would make criminal:
  Two spouses discuss their vote, realize they disagree on every important
   issue, and agree that, since they're cancelling one another out, neither
   vote.
Two friendly legislators who disagree with one another's positions arrange
   not to vote on two separate occasions, when one, then the other, is absent,
   thus cancelling out the effect of their absences on the final decisions
  ; A politician such as Governor George Bush or Vice President Al Gore
offers a
   monetary inducement in the form of a tax cut to a voter.
   A politician, during tough economic times, promises "a chicken in every pot"
   if voters cast their vote for him.
    A political columnist urges voters to do exactly what the web sites in
   question urge them to do.
   "Bill Jones seems to be afraid of the Internet and the powers of expression
   and association that it gives to people," said Eliasberg. "That power of
   combining immediate association and direct speech is the reason people have
   sought to regulate the Internet more strictly than other media. I don't
   believe that Jones would have made the same threats if the same content had
   been expressed in a more traditional medium such as a newspaper column or a
   call-in radio show."
   "Jones and other government officials and agencies need to take notice,"
   Eliasberg. "The ACLU will not allow the Internet to become the First
   punching bag, to become the one medium in which we allow the government
to act
   out its habitual suspicion of public free speech and free association."
Best Regards,
I hope you're taking good notes, because history will be reported differently.

lawyers that I should be sued for something.  She blames me for scaring
off president Mubarak from the ICANN show.  The woman is unfortunately

and as a result has always been pushed to excell.  But that has not been
the case.  On a technological front she is all show - no substance.
And that show started early in life.  She herself can confirm that her
schooling at harvard was for no other purpose then socialization.  I think
meeting the right people was her angle for attendance.
I understand her venture capital positions have mainly failed, her
chairmanship of ICANN has been an absolute disaster.  She's being disposed
as the chair this november - that does not mean ICANN will be a better

John Palmer is on the right track ..
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Mr. Touton,
This is to inform you that AGN Domain Name Service, Inc is asserting legals rights to the top level domains .USA, .EARTH and .Z. We have operated a registry for these top-level domains since late 1995. If you check the famous "Postel List", you can see that we were one of the first applicants for new top level domains in late 1995. At that time, we established our registry and have been in operation since that time taking registrations in .EARTH and .USA. In March of 1997, we added the .Z top-level domain. ADNS disagrees with the direction that ICANN is taking the Domain Name System and we do not choose to participate in the ICANN process. Instead, we are
supporting alternative root server networks and will continue to do so.
Although none of our three top-level domains have been entered into the ICANN application process at this time, we would like to inform you that we are
asserting legal ownership of these top level domains. Any attempt to add them to the ICANN controlled root zone under the control and ownership of any other party will be considered by ADNS to be an infringement of our legal rights and we will take appropriate action. For ICANN to assign these
top-level domains to another party in the ICANN root would dilute our service mark and damage our company financially. In addition to this, it would also
fragment the internet as there would be two different versions of the same top-level domain.
In spite of Ms.Dyson's claim, alternative root networks take great care not to allow fragmentation by allowing competing versions of top level domains into their root zones if they are already in existence in another root zone. We would expect ICANN to take the same care and consideration to avoid fragmentation. There is room for all of us on the internet. Please respect our rights to operate our business and respect the rights of alternative root networks. If you have any questions, you can contact me by e-mail. You may consider this an "open letter" and can publish it if you wish.

Actually no - that's not the case.  The fax thing is part of legend - or
fame whatever, right.  I used to fax the government of ontario via my own
designed fax balasting facilities.  This was before the advent of email,
which I find more effecient.  Although fax is more expensive for
government.  I used to cost them about $5,000,000 $CAN per year in fax
stationary costs.  But email is more efficient.  I recently emailed the
entire US govenment expressing my concerns to the civil servants over the
US govenment action on domains (ICANN).  That went over well.  I also
emailed all of the egyptian government over ICANN and president mubarek
ended up standing them up (he was going to speak at the opeining meeting).
Now - the only court order I am under is from Judge Edmond Brown of
London.  I am under a gag order to not discuss the abuse of children in
fort lauderdale florida and cornwall ontario, including the government
coverup involved nor can I reveal the names of the senior law officers
involved both in the abuse of children and in conceilment and destruction
of the evidence.
Up here in Canada it's OK to fuck children as yonge as 8 - provided your
part of the establishment.  So that's about it for that.
No - you might be getting that confused with the Dr. baptista's Freedom
Of Information campaign which resulted in an overhaul of the entire FOIR
system in Ontario.  That one cost my governments in excess of 500 million
$CND, so they decided to stream line the system - and now our FOIR
commissioner practices interior decore in her offices.  The commissioner
who was the senior FOIR officer under my campaign ended up adjudicating tribunals for used car sales.  A great way to end ones carrer.  For
the longest time he disappeared, and we though he was dead.  You know politicians will kill each other if necessary.  If blackmail
don't work ... etc.
were a very civil society.  but canadians have been bombing politicians
recently (and for the last five years).  So who knows what's going to
happen.  There's only so much those poor canuks can get pissed on before
they hang their prime minister.

What about two 8 year olds giving it to each other up the wazoo.  Would
you consider that violent?
Should we send those kids to jail - or maybe execute the parents?
Up in my village the kids start young.  We had a vibrant community - but
all the jobs have gone and what we have left are kids as young as 8
shooting themselves up with heroin.  The average age they start is at 10
to 14 and most of them make their money off the sex trade.  Their
collective goal seems oriented at getting high and staying high.  All sex
means to them is a means to an end.  Even money is of little significance,
the main goal is getting and staying high.
Now, the one thing that really makes me sick to my stomach is the constant
jibberish I hear from people who constantly harp on about saving the
pretty little children - meanwhile I have heroin addicts as young as 8
banging each other in the park just down the street.  For all the
allegator tears I see here and elsewhere - I never see anything of value
result from it.  Could you save the 8 years olds who are banging each
other in my park?  I have no idea what they need - i'll be frank with you
there - but they need a new life, what they have now is shit.
I've noticed people will spend more time trying to silence groups like
namble instead of solving the root problem.  Kids these days are in
serious trouble.  People like those in namble are only taking advantage of
a preexiting situation.  In my town kids are easy to get into bed if you
have the right qualifications.  And unfortunately those qualifications are
not very high.  Most of these kids are from families who lost their lively
hood when the jobs flew.  If you can keep them high - you qualify.
A good example is in fact found in our town.  I call him the "morphine
nipple".  He's an old crippled man, dying of cancer, and as drunk as a
skunk.  You can always find an assortment of boys and girls hanging around
his place.  And the kids goals are basically - how much morphine can we
squeeze out of the morphine nipple.  So the boys drop their drawers and
expose their dinkys and the girls expose their twinkies and the ol
morphine nipple gets milked.
Kid's these days are pigs and any fault to be found I suggest is with
their parents.
Forget the whole concept of childhood - that's a fiction
long gone.  Based on my experience I think I'm the last person on this
planet who actually had a great childhood - and I was innocent
too.  That's rare these days.  And in my opinion an unfortunate
observation and my advantage.

law officers in Canada - how would you react to this?

Title: Uzbekistan Eyewitnesses See Dozens of US Casualties
12 December 2001 : Uzbekistan Eyewitnesses See Dozens of US Casualties
 Daily news, articles and interviews on the Jihad in Afghanistan LONDON (IWPR): The London-based Institute for War and Peace
Reporting has reported from Khanabad, Uzbekistan, that the US
air base in this city is receiving daily flights carrying dead
and injured US soldiers. Uzbek sources at Khanabad suggest
that the real figures of US casualties are far higher than the
Pentagon's official totals. Uzbek army personnel working at
the air base said scores of US casualties have been arriving
there. From November 25 to December 2, an Uzbek orderly
working with American medical staff said he had witnessed the
arrival of four to five US helicopters - carrying between them
10-15 American casualties - each day. The orderly said the US
staff he was helping confirmed the casualties coming off the
aircraft were Americans.
A reporter who managed to enter the air base with a group of
visiting Uzbek parents said that one whole floor of a building
and four large canvas tents were full of injured US soldiers,
who have suffered shrapnel and bullet wounds to the arms, leg
and head. The airport sources could not confirm how many
incoming casualties had died. One Uzbek soldier said that
since October 15 he had helped US servicemen load 20 body bags
onto American transport planes. But he could not confirm
whether they were dead US soldiers.
But there is other evidence of American fatalities. One Uzbek
officer said US soldiers had told him that four of their
comrades had died of their wounds on December 1 while being
airlifted to Khanabad. An Uzbek pilot spoke of the death last
week of an American soldier who he had become friendly with
while he was on the base. The US serviceman, he said, had died
in the attempt to end the prison riot on the outskirts of
Mazar-e-Sharif two weeks ago. "A lot of American troops died
there - it was a real battle, " the pilot said.
Uzbek army personnel say the atmosphere on the base has
changed distinctly in the last week or so. They say that in
October when the Americans began deploying at the airport,
they were gung-ho, telling their Uzbek counterparts that it
would take no more than a month and a half to defeat the
Taleban and al-Qaeda. While the Taleban appear to be on their
last legs, al-Qaeda fighters continue to resist in mountain
redoubts, with some US servicemen at Khanabad now resigned to
a long haul. Uzbek military staff say frustration at this is
noticeable. They say they have witnessed growing tensions
among American troops, often overhearing arguments and
shouting matches.
ARAB MUJAHIDEEN WITNESSED AERIAL SUPPORT FROM ALLAAH(SWT)
TORA BORA (Special Report): On Saturday afternoon after Asr
Prayers, the Eastern Shura launched a concentrated offensive
against Mujahideen positions in the Tora Bora mountains.
According to news reports from the area, it was the most
intense attack launched against them so far. Haji Qadeer's
forces had close air and armour support. The US Air Force
bombed the Mujahideen positions savegely and heavy armour was
also pitted against them. The fighting was so intense that the
Mujahideen initiated a tactical retreat to the mountains with
light weapons. They had earlier resolved to die fighting
instead of being taken prisoner. It was when they had moved
back and the forces of the Eastern Shura, supported by a heavy
detachment of US ground troops had moved forward, that bombs
began to fall on the Coalition forces from the sky, killing
300 of the enemy comprising Americans and Haji Qadeer's
This was without doubt a miracle from Allah (SWT) who had
blinded the American pilots so that they bombed their own
people. The Mujahideen counter- attacked after this incident
and killed another 300 US troops/ Alliance militia, capturing
100 prisoners. It has been reported that a joint force of 900
troops including US soldiers and Eastern Shura militia
attacked the Mujahideen who numbered around 500 troops.
This was a highly organised offensive against the Mujahideen,
which was coordinated by high-ranking US military commanders,
whose mutilated bodies littered the battlefield at the end of
the battle. It has been reported that after this major victory
for the Mujahideen, Haji Qadeer asked the Americans to deploy
more ground troops as American air support has proved to be
impotent against the Mujahideen and lethal instead to the
Americans and their agents. The Mujahideen sources claimed
that it was doubtlessly help from Allah (SWT)
AL-JAZEERA CHANNEL: AMERICAN COMMANDERS KILLED BY MORTAR FIRE
IN TORA BORA
TORA BORA (Al-Jazeera): It was one day last week when a mortar
round from the Arab Mujahideen positions in Tora Bora hit the
command center of the Eastern Alliance, while a planning
session was in progress. According to news reports, high level
US military commanders as well as Haji Qadir's top commanders
were present in the session. The command center was destroyed
by the round and the Eastern Alliance militia used excessive
force to keep the foreign journalists and TV crews from the
scene of carnage. Al-Jazeera Network speculated that this
harrassement was to cover up the heavy blow dealt to the
command structure of the US forces in the area.

Al Jazeera plans version in English By Charles Clover in Doha
(Filed: 12/11/2001) THE only television station broadcasting live from Taliban-held areas of
Afghanistan plans to introduce an English version early next year. Al Jazeera, based in Qatar, has around 15 million viewers a day in the
Arab world, including satellite subscribers in the West. But, as it
broadcasts in Arabic, it does not have the global audiences that
broadcasting in English could bring it. Clips from Al Jazeera's footage of the bombing of Kabul and the video
messages sent by Osama bin Laden to its office in Kabul have been used by
networks around the world, including the BBC, ITN, CNN and Sky News. But the station has been accused by Colin Powell, the US secretary of
state, and Tony Blair of screening broadcasts which could contain coded
messages and Taliban propaganda without a critical commentary. Ibrahim Hilal, the 32-year-old Egyptian editor-in-chief of the station,
said he was under intense pressure from managers to launch English
language broadcasts by January. He thought March was more realistic. He denies allegations of bias: "We give time to anybody in this crisis. If
the Archbishop of Canterbury has something to say he will be on my screen. We had him the other day." ) Copyright of Telegraph Group Limited 2001. Joe Baptista

@_subject: HOWTO Build a Nuclear Device 
One thing that is bothering me these days are all the reports coming out
of Afganistan that nuclear bomb making plans were found.  Big
deal.  Anyone on the planet can make a nuclear device if they have the
appropriate materials.  The hard part is staying alive due to exposure
while manufacturing the device.
If however death is not an issue then the process itself becomes easy to
 4 stainless steal salad bowls (5 - 8 inch diameter)
10 pounds of U-235 (Plutonium)
 1 containment cylinder in which to fit the salad bowls
 ? some explosives - C4 platic works best - but TNT or gun powder is
10 pounds of U-235 is required to achive critical mass.  However less will
work but you will get a sub critical mass on detonation.  The difference
is taking out an entire city as opposed to a few city blocks.
Divide the U-235 into two five pound masses.  Beat it evenly into the inside of one of your salad bowls.  U-235 is malleable like gold so you
should have no problem shaping it.  Do the same with the other U-235 mass
and shape it into the other salad bowl.
Keep the two bowls apart - you don't want an accident to cause your
project to go critical.
C4 explosives work best.  You simply mold the C4 into the other two salad
bowls.  This is the most dangerous part of the project.  Improper handling
of C4 can cause an explosion.  But gun powder is just as effective.
Now fit the U-235 salad bowls into the C4 salad bowls and place them at
each end of the cylindrical containment.  Connect your explosives to a
detonator and close off the ends of the cylynder.  Make sure the detonator
sets off both explosives at the same time.
The trick is to bring the U-235 masses together at the same time.
And thats it.  I would recommend some form of protection while building
the project.  The aprons worn by dentists will work.  They will protect
you to some degree from radioactive poisoning.  However - your life is
only being prolonged by taking such measures - you still will end up dead
due to the U-235 radiation regardless of what you do.
And thats it.
Anyone on this planet can build a nuclear device.  So the only issue in
building the device is the will to die for a cause.  And the only thing I
find unfortunate in all of this is that there are so many causes that
people are willing to die for.  And war will not make those reasons go
away - it will only encourage them.

@_subject: HOWTO Build a Nuclear Device 
Incorrect.  Uranium is an actinide series element.  It is a hard silver
almost white substance which is both malleable and ductile.  Of course
this does not imply you should use it as a replacement for duck
tape.  Also like gold it has a luster when polished.
not surprised.

@_subject: HOWTO Build a Nuclear Device 
That is the issue is it not?  The fact is the building of a nuclear bomb
and the associated risks are questionable.  Much easier to just work with
easy to find materials.
Incidentally - the process of refining U-235 from U-238 is not impossible
- and I suspect U-235 is easily available on the black market.  It's
normally distributed as little pellets.
But you are absolutly correct - much easier to just goto the local
supermarket and pick up a few sundries and bang - you've got a bomb - or
something dangerous.
My point was that it is unfortunate that humanity is so repressed that
issues exist which cause individuals or groups to manufacture such things
with the intent of committing harm.  Sept 11 is an excellent example of
this where planes became flying bombs.
And it is much easier to walk onto a plane and use it to cause harm then
building a nuclear device.

Here's a reference which should give you a good but brief outline of
Uranium and it associated properties and uses.
Incendentally this reference is taken from the CRC Handbook of Chemistry
and Physics a great reference manual.  I still have my old copy in storage
- great paper weight ;)
Now one thing I've forgotten is that uranium is also pyrophoric when
finely divided.  I wonder if that property can be capitalized on to cause
harm.  Not only could one use Uranium (235, 238 whatever) as an incendiary
device but both types of U will leave a radioactive hazard.  Of course
it's more logical to use U-238 for that.

Now - i've replied to you below - but I think were missing the point of
the post.  So i'll repeat - it's easy to do harm when you have the will to
die to rally your cause - as we have seen on sept 11.  and i find it
regrettable that conditions exist in which people use extreme methods
to focus the people of this planet on the fact that western governments
are basically evil.
Now the remainder of my reply is not much more then having a physics
discussion - which i think is not the point - but --
I said it was malleable - it can be worked.  maybe not the same way or
gold or silver - but as you can see from the periodic table it is
malleable.  I personally have never worked it.  But i have seen a few
pelets in my lifetime.
Possible - never build one myself.  I would assume that if it is harder to
work then gold - then just get very thick stanless steel bowls.  I'm sure
you'd need a few trials to figure it out.
just what it means - so your right - it shares that characteristic with
other metals.
sounds unrefined or badly oxidized.  I've never seen chunks of
uranium.  Was this in it's unrefined state.  What was it

I very much doubt terrorist would build an efficient bomb.  Non of what we
discussed is effcient.  Your pipe idea is a very interesting example.  But
I think the point is made that harm can be done.  Even if the mass does
not go critical - it still means a few city blocks that will be
inconvenienced from the resulting radiation.  You pipe certainly would not
go boom - but it would leave a mess of radioactivity in the area.

RUSSIANS UNEXPECTEDLY ARRIVE IN KABUL
FULL STORY:
   Last Updated: Tue Nov 27 22:16:38 2001    KABUL - While U.S. Marines were consolidating their bridgehead near
   Kandahar in southern Afghanistan, Russian troops unexpectedly arrived
   in Kabul.
   They set up camp on a piece of waste ground, and have so far refused
   to say what they're doing in the capital.
   Some sources said they are setting up a temporary embassy, others said
   a field hospital. But it looks like a military camp and many Afghans
   have bitter memories of the 10 years of Soviet occupation.
   "A few years ago they came here (to) Afghanistan and they fought with
   people. And they are very crude people. We don't like (them)," said
   one man. "Russians destroyed all of Afghanistan. Maybe they are now
   coming to help," said another.
   Given the Soviet occupation of this country in the 1980s, Russian
   soldiers may not be the ideal choice for a humanitarian mission. But
   Russia is a strong supporter of the Northern Alliance, which has been
   in power in Kabul for two weeks.
   Russia may be flexing its muscle as one of the regional powers in
   Afghanistan, or it may be keen to show that if Washington can put
   Marines in Kandahar, then Moscow can put troops in downtown Kabul.

AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL Latest Press Release
Amnesty International urges investigation of Ariel Sharon
Publish date: 03/10/2001
A court in Brussels will today (3 October 2001) begin to
consider arguments about whether Israel's Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon may be investigated in Belgium for alleged
war crimes committed in Lebanon in 1982 while he was
Israel's Minister of Defence.
"Amnesty International welcomes actions taken in
accordance with international law to combat impunity,"
said the organization. "We support the judicial
investigation into Ariel Sharon's responsibility with
regard to the Sabra and Shatila massacre." The complaint against Sharon was first lodged with the
Belgian Public Prosecutor's Office in June 2001. Ariel
Sharon was Minister of Defence, with overall
responsibility for the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), at
the time of the 1982 massacre of Palestinians in Sabra and
Shatila refugee camps on the outskirts of Beirut. The IDF
allowed the Lebanese Phalange militia to enter the camps
where the killing of hundreds, mostly Palestinian
refugees, continued for at least 30 hours. The
complainants, a group of 23 Lebanese and Palestinians, had
filed the case under Belgian legislation enacted in 1993
and 1999 which allows Belgian courts to prosecute
foreigners for certain offences committed abroad,
including genocide, war crimes and crimes against
humanity. However, the resulting investigation was
suspended by the investigating magistrate in early
September 2001 until doubts about the legal validity of
the procedure were resolved. Amnesty International calls on states to ensure prompt,
thorough and independent investigations wherever
allegations of crimes under international law are made. If
such an investigation shows there is enough evidence for a
prosecution, then, in accordance with international law
which allows the national courts of any state to try
people accused of such crimes, regardless of the
nationality of the alleged perpetrators or victims and
regardless of where the crimes were committed, Amnesty
International calls on states to bring the accused to
trial or extradite them to another country for trial,
provided certain safeguards are met. No one may be
extradited to a country which cannot assure that any trial
on such charges meets international standards for fairness
and does not result in the imposition of the death penalty
or other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment. The lawyer representing Israel argued that Belgium lacks
the legal authority to try Ariel Sharon on charges
relating to the 1982 massacre. Among her arguments the
lawyer stated that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has
immunity as a head of government; the case had already
been considered in Israel by the Kahan Commission of
Inquiry, which was a judicial commission; the 1993 law
cannot be used retroactively; and the case has no
connection with Belgium. A Brussels public prosecutor
rejected the defence arguments and said that the case
should go ahead. The court hearing due to start on 3
October will rule on the legality of the proceedings
against Ariel Sharon in Belgium, not on the content of the
case against him.
Amnesty International has welcomed Belgium's universal
jurisdiction laws and the 27 August 2001 statements
attributed to Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt
voicing support for the legislation and suggesting that it
be extended to the entire European Union.
The first case involving the exercise of universal
jurisdiction to come to trial in Belgium resulted in the
conviction in June 2001 of four Rwandan nationals for war
crimes committed in 1994. Amnesty International welcomed
this judgement as a significant step forward in the use of
universal jurisdiction, an essential tool in the struggle
against impunity.
A number of criminal complaints have been lodged with the
Belgian courts against leaders and prominent members of
past and present governments. In addition to Ariel Sharon,
these have included: former Chilean President General
Augusto Pinochet; former Speaker of Parliament and
President of the Islamic Republic of Iran Hojjatoleslam
Ali Akbar Rafsanjani; former Moroccan Minister of Interior
Driss Basri; former Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia
Ndombasi and several other government ministers of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo;  President Paul Kagame
of Rwanda; former President Hissene Habre of Chad; and
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
The principle of universal jurisdiction permits the
national courts of any state to try people accused of
crimes under international law, including war crimes,
crimes against humanity, and genocide as well as torture,
extrajudicial executions and "disappearances," regardless
of the nationality of the alleged perpetrators or victims
and regardless of where the crimes were committed.
In 1983 the official Israeli Commission of Inquiry into
the Events at the Refugee Camps in Beirut concluded that
Minister of Defence Ariel Sharon had "disregarded the
danger of acts of vengeance and bloodshed by
Phalangists...  failed to take this danger into account
when he decided to have the Phalangists enter the
camps...[and had not ordered] appropriate measures for
preventing or reducing the danger of massacre as a
condition for the Phalangists' entry into the camps." The
commission recommended that "the Minister of Defence draw
the appropriate personal conclusions arising out of the
defects revealed with regard to the manner in which he
discharged the duties of his office." Ariel Sharon
resigned from his position as Minister of Defence
following publication of the Commission's report in 1983.
In February 2001 Ariel Sharon was elected Prime Minister
of Israel; he took office in March.

Cyber Protests: The Threat to the U.S. Information Infrastructure
October 2001
Executive Summary
Political events and emerging international situations will
increasingly lead to cyber protests. The cyber protests that have
occurred thus far have had little impact on U.S. infrastructure. As
computing technology becomes faster and better, and hacking tools
become more advanced and easier to use, cyber protesting and
hacktivism will become more significant to U.S. national interests.
Cyber protesters are becoming increasingly more organized and their
techniques more sophisticated but, most likely, will continue to
deface web sites and perform DoS attacks. There will also be an
increase in the number of apparently unrelated hacking groups
participating in the cyber protests. National boundaries will not
always be clearly delineated in attacks on opposing organizations.
International activity will also tend to spill over into the United
States. Because the United States is a multicultural, world-leading
nation it will suffer from attacks on culturally related sites and
structures in the future.
Generally, the most popularly targeted sites are those belonging to
government, educational, commercial, and cultural institutions.
However, any site with an exploitable vulnerability will be
susceptible to a cyber attack. The infrastructure has been targeted in
other countries in cyber protests and it is expected that it will
eventually be targeted in the United States as well. Cyber protesters
certainly will target infrastructure more often and exploit
opportunities to disrupt or damage it.
Web sites that remain open to known hacking tools will have a higher
probability of suffering defacement. Network administrators must
remain educated and defenses must evolve along with the threats and
offensive capabilities. Although the cyber protests seen today have
already caused limited damage, the potential for future attacks could
bring about large economic losses as well as potentially severe damage
to the national infrastructure, affecting global markets as well as
public safety.
In the last decade, with the explosion of the size of the Internet,
protests and political activism have entered a new realm. (1)
Political activism on the Internet has already generated a wide range
of activity, from using e-mail and web sites to organize, to web page
defacements and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. (2) These politically
motivated computer-based attacks are usually described as hacktivism,
a marriage of hacking and political activism.
In addition to the consistent activity of groups devoted to a specific
long-term cause, the Internet has also seen short-term periods of
intense political activity, which can be referred to as cyber
protests. Cyber protests have become a worldwide phenomenon available
to anyone with access to computers. Unrestrained by geographic
boundaries, protesters have an enormous forum in which to be heard.
Cyber protesters have a wide range of goals or objectives. Some
hackers want to expose government corruption or fundamental violation
of human rights; others just want to hack and cause mischief for fun.
It has only been since 1998 that cyber protests have skyrocketed in
popularity and become commonplace in today's computerized world.
The most common type of cyber protest comes in the form of web page
defacements. In such scenarios, a web site is compromised through some
security deficiency and the hacker is able to alter it, many times
placing propaganda, profanity, or pornographic images on it. This can
range from being a nuisance and embarrassment for an organization to a
major economic loss for an e-commerce business.
Protests and civil disturbances are nothing new. People unhappy with
their situations have always found outlets to spread their message, be
it a peaceful sit-in, letter-writing campaign, picket march, or
violent gang fight. Now, with the advent of the Internet and the
growing number of people online, it has become easier to organize
protests. That is not to say that every web defacement is an organized
event on the part of some political organization. Many defacements are
perpetrated by lone hackers that have no political motivation other
than to create chaos. Nation-states and their respective citizens have
also been involved in cyber protests. Several countries have waged
ongoing cyber battles against each other through web defacements and
DoS attacks. Mail bombing is a popular form of a DoS attack. Massive
amounts of e-mail or web traffic are directed against a specific site,
overloading it and causing it to crash. It should be noted, however,
that some parties involved in these cyber protests are not citizens of
the respective countries. They might hold similar views or they might
be involved just to participate in hacking different sites. Alliances
can be tenuous at best for some of these groups.
Chinese Hackers
One high profile incident occurred in May 1999 after the United States
accidentally bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia during
the NATO air campaign. U.S. web sites were defaced in the name of
China and massive e-mail campaigns were executed to gain sympathy and
support for the Chinese cause. Government web sites were primarily
targeted. The U.S. Departments of Energy and the Interior, and the
National Park Service all suffered web page defacements. In addition,
the White House web site was taken down for three days after it was
continually mail bombed. This action was relatively unorganized in
fashion, short in length, and affected a small number of U.S. sites.
Pro-Chinese hackers also acted against Taiwan during the Taiwanese
presidential elections in August and September 1999. Cyber protesters
and hacktivists compromised 165 Taiwanese web sites, mainly defacing
them, over the two-month period. Their ultimate goal, as it was
stated, was to negatively affect and bring down Taiwan's
infrastructure. Among the targeted sites were electricity, economic
institutions, telecommunications, and air traffic control. Although
teams began to develop and organize near the end of the operations,
the damage was relatively light, similar to the attacks on U.S. sites
earlier in the year. Importantly, strategic targeting and some
organization of forces became accepted strategies for future protests
and hacks. These hackers are likely to become more organized and more
successful in future incidents. (3)
In late April and early May 2001 pro-Chinese hacktivists and cyber
protesters began a cyber assault on U.S. web sites. This resulted from
an incident in early April where a Chinese fighter jet was lost at sea
after colliding with a U.S. naval reconnaissance airplane. It also
coincided with the two-year anniversary of the Chinese embassy bombing
by the United States in Belgrade and the traditionally celebrated May
Day and Youth Day in China. Led by the Honkers Union of China (HUC),
pro-Chinese hackers defaced or crashed over 100 seemingly random web
sites, mainly .gov and .com, through DoS attacks and similar exploits.
(4) Although some of the tools used were sophisticated, they were
readily available to both sides on the Internet.
Many defacements of U.S. sites included posting pictures of the dead
Chinese pilot Wang Wei and profane messages calling for the downfall
of the United States. ProUnited States hackers responded with similar
defacements, messages, and damage on 300 Chinese web sites. Of
interest is that some pro-Chinese hackers violated hacker etiquette by
wiping some compromised servers. (5) The rule of thumb is to deface or
crash a web site but to leave the information intact, otherwise it is
considered bad form. (6)
Israeli and Palestinian Hackers
In October 2000, Israeli and Palestinian hackers engaged in
adversarial hacking when the prolonged peace talks between the two
groups broke down. During this difficult time, hackers seized the
opportunity to attack web sites belonging to the opposition. Starting
October 6, 2000, 40 Israeli web sites and at least 15 Palestinian web
sites suffered defacements at the hands of opposing hackers. (7) This
coincided, of course, with physical violence in the region. It was
also a problem for U.S. based web sites. U.S. web sites will often
fall victim, regardless of their lack of proximity or involvement in
the events. For example, several U.S. sites were hacked by
pro-Palestinian hacktivists, including the take down of a lobbyist
group web site. The hackers then posted group membership information
and credit card numbers. (8) This activity did little to affect the
United States as a whole although it illustrates how a seemingly
unrelated event can potentially affect U.S. sites.
The level of sophistication ranged from low-level activity using
simple defacements to coordinated, relatively sophisticated attacks
such as potential root access penetrations. Several hacking tools were
developed specifically for this engagement. Any type of attack was
considered during this time, including the perpetration of viruses,
DoS attacks with e-mail bombing, and sustained, amplified pinging
attacks. Web sites containing these various hacking tools were readily
available for download to anyone who wanted to join the action.
Pro-Palestinian hackers hit any type of Israeli sites that they were
able to compromise, many times defacing them with messages such as,
"Free Palestine" or "Free Kashmir." (9) FloodNet software was a major
tool used by the Israelis. The cyber protesters simply visited a site
and FloodNet would repeatedly send requests to the targeted server.
This type of virtual sit-in is a popular form of a DoS attack. Many of
these attacks were successful as servers were bombarded and went down
repeatedly. Targets included ethnic specific organizational web sites
and those of financial institutions to disrupt the infrastructure.
E-commerce sites crashed and there was an economic impact reflected in
the Israeli markets. It was, however, the root access attempts that
were most dangerous for the defenders. Hackers who can gain root
access to sites give them unlimited freedom to do whatever they wish.
This is the highest level of penetration possible although no
successful root access penetrations were reported.
These events attracted a wide variety of hackers eager to join the
fight. Both sides were well-organized and used reconnaissance and
intelligence gathering techniques to maximize their effectiveness.
Even outside hacking groups, such as G-Force Pakistan, joined forces
with the Palestinians to lend a helping hand. This is increasingly
common. Some outside groups join an effort because they have similar
political or ethnic motivations, however, this is not always the case.
Some groups participate in hacks simply for the desire to hack or the
publicity, not out of a sense of loyalty.
Overall it can be expected that Israeli and Palestinian hackers will
be active whenever a stumbling block appears in the road to possible
peace between the groups. On the other hand, increased hacking might
also occur when the Israelis and Palestinians are close to a peace
agreement. System administrators must remain vigilant and focused on
providing effective network security.
Indian and Pakistani Hackers
Another example is India and Pakistan engaging in a cyber protest
caused by national and ethnic differences. After a cease-fire in the
Kashmir Valley hackers took it upon themselves to continue the
hostilities. In 2000, pro-Pakistani hackers defaced more than 500
Indian web sites. Conversely, only one known Pakistani site was hacked
by the Indians. This illustrates a large difference in technical,
hacking abilities or the willingness to use the skills to strike at an
adversary. In this event the apparent level of sophistication on both
sides is relatively low. Web site defacements are the leading form of
this protest. The group G-Force Pakistan was the most active group
claiming involvement in the events. 10
Japanese Incidents
Recently, Japan has been targeted twice in online protests. During the
first week of April 2001, pro-Korean hackers attacked Japanese
organizations responsible for the approval of a new history textbook.
The textbook glossed over atrocities committed by Japan during World
War II and the occupation of China and South Korea. The perceived
reluctance of Japan to accept responsibility for its actions triggered
these events. The main participants in this incident were Korean
university students, who used e-mail bombs in a DoS attack. The
students crashed several web sites, including Japan's Education
Ministry, Liberal Democratic Party and the publishing company
responsible for the textbook." These attacks were neither long lasting
nor were they largely organized.
In early August 2001, pro-Chinese hackers targeted Japanese web sites
after Japan's Prime Minister visited a controversial war memorial, the
Yasukuni Shrine. In a brief period of time, hackers defaced several
web sites belonging mainly to Japanese companies and research
institutes. 12 This indicates the continuing willingness of
pro-Chinese hackers to use cyberspace and hacking tools as a platform
for protests and cyber civil disobedience, as well as for displaying a
strong sense of patriotic nationalism.
While the cyber damage thus far has been minimal, the infrastructure
will certainly be a target of cyber protestors and hacktivists in the
future, with the potential goal being intentional destruction rather
than public embarrassment or purely political statements. Pro-active
network defense and security management are imperative to the
prevention of more serious damage to infrastructure assets.
International cooperation and private-public cooperation within the
United States is necessary to ensure the ongoing function of the
critical infrastructure.
1. Historically, groups have never had the global platform that the
Internet provides today. Bulletin boards and group subscriber lists
were the only computerized links protestors had from the 1970s through
the early 1990s. The introduction of web browsers supporting graphics
and multimedia content and the expansive growth of the Internet,
coupled with the growing number of home computers, gave organizations
a new outlet for distributing information or disrupting events for a
political cause. The fact that many organizations have a web site has
enabled them to spread their beliefs to a wider audience. It has also
enabled other groups to target them for attack.
2. Freedom of speech is a fundamental right protected by the
Constitution of the United States of America that should not be taken
lightly. Individuals and groups generally have the right to actively
and legally support those causes in which they believe. Many
protesters and political activist groups have used cyberspace to
organize and advance their memberships and activities. Using computers
and the Internet has greatly increased protesters' effectiveness in
spreading their message and achieving their goals. This paper deals
with past incidents in which cyber protests have led to the
destruction of property and other illegal activities, citing,
specifically, foreign protests.

6. This highlights the fact that although web defacements usually
cause minimal damage, they indicate a very serious breach in security.
A web defacement is, by definition, the manipulation of a web server's
data by gaining unauthorized access to that server. It must be
determined if the hacker installed a back door, introduced malicious
code, or affected the server in any other way. A seemingly low-level
hack could result in future problems if systems administrators do not
take positive actions to stop future intrusions and restore the server
to its previous condition.

your showing a level of concern which is understandable.  but what i see
is a simple fact.  people are afraid of their governments - and we all
know governments are run by monsters these days and few people will stand
up to monsters.
i do however find it very entertaining to watch US politicians speak on
the issue.  your political infrastructure is out of control and as a
result anything significant can happen as a response to this unfortunate
act.  martial law is a definate possibility if this happens again.
now the world is a very bad place.  one thing i find insulting from all
the newscasts is us politicians claiming that freedom and democracy have
enemies - which is the ongoing retoric.  the real question is why did this
happen.  or another question is why were their celebrations on the streets
of china and most of the arab world.
i don't think the people on those plains were enemies of freedom or
democracy.  people who have freedom, liberty, and democracy do not have to
resort to suicide missions to get attention.  people who resort to these
methods have lost hope and have no other means of addressing thier
according to the fbi there were 12 to 24 people in all involved.  in my
opinion they were lost soals who appointed themselves judge, jury and
executioners.  these people yesturday delivered a verdict - which in all
amounted to the execution of 50,000 people.
now that we know the verdict the only outstand question is what were the
charges?  why did these people do this?  what was their motivation?  so far i have not figured that one out.  sure arabs are dancing in the
street - their happy - poor arafat was doing penance today by giving
blood.  and i understand the japanese red army is also being blamed for
this.  but all these claims so far amount to little frills here and their
to enhance the show.  i have yet to receive a clear explaination on what
drove these people to do this tragedy.

Well I've looked at it carefully and all I see is links to more
nonsense.  Let me explain this to you and hopefully provide you a well
earned education.
This is a picture of a child - just one out of hundreds that we evacuated
to Canada from Afganistan during the russian occupation of Afganistan.
I don't remember his name - like I said we handled hundreds of these
kids.  But this little boy is just one of many who were subjected to the
russian idea of how to win a war.  You may remember Declan that the
russians at the time were losing the war against the afganis and they
resorted to building bombs which looked like toys.
The idea was to drop these bomb-toys in the hope of maiming and injuring
afganis children with the ultimate hope of demoralizing the population
through the victimization of their children.  It did not work - but the
scars are real - and damage was done.
This child was lucky - after years of reconstructive surgery at the Hotel
Deu hospital in Kingston Ontario he was able to walk normally again.
Now I should stress the American Military at the time was instrumental in
assisting us in evacuating these children and by default we saved many
Osama Bin Ladin and the Fatwa are of no significance to what happened in
america.  They are the symbols of a struggle that has been going on for
many years.  A struggle against oppression and planned genocide in which
the United States has been a significant contributor and
supporter.  i.e. Israel's oppression of the palestinians, i.e. south
africa, i.e. east timor etc. etc. etc.
Arabs are by default very nobel, trustworthy and honourable people.  But
they are not cows.  They will not bow their heads as their civilization is
brutalized and raped.  They will fight back with the vengence that is
the holy jihad.
Kill Osama Bin Ladin and you create another arab saint and many more holy
warriors take his place.  That is the nature of the beast.
The terror we saw in new york and washington this week is the harvest of
many years of seed planting by the US government.  It represents the
response of a people who have been opressed and lied to for years by a
US government which claims to support the virtues of freedom and
democracy yet funds terror on a world wide basis for no better reason then
to make a profit.
Again I say that these men who were responsible for this terror acted as
judge jury and executioners.  And the verdict of this self appointed
inquisition was the terror we saw this week and which will be with us for
many more years.  And I still say to you that the reasons and the question
of why this was done have yet to be provided to us.

James - I find your statements incredible.  America is being attacked for
being rich and free?  I don't think so.  That is however a good argument
as to why people immigrate there - but that's the extent of it.
If these people are arabs - and i still don't have any proof of that -
then we can assume they blew up the WTC in protest of americas support of
terror and antidemocratic institutions - i.e. the palestinian israel
The jihad is an action against the fundamental laws of Allah (God) which
are more or less the same laws outlined in the holy bible - old
testament.  The jihad is an action against those who offend the word and
laws of God.
Being free and being rich is not an offense against God.  However claiming
to be the advicates of democracy and freedom while simultaneously
supporting offensive regeims is an offense against God and common sense
for that matter.
Last night I had the opportunity of watching the CBC a canadian
program.  It was a public participation forum - and i'll tell you anytime
the american advocates claimed they were bombed because it was an attack
against democracy and freedom all the canadian participants laughed.
It became ridiculous watching this.
I have many american friends who are very angry these days.  Many very
depressed.  Many have lost a great deal.  And this is fueling a potential
war which will make vietnam look like a broadway comedy.  many american
boys are going to die over this one and i find that an even greater
Don't forget James - if in fact Bin Landen is involved in this then the
facts remain that the US Government sponsored and assisted him during the
Russian occupation of afganistan.  So we can argue here that your
government not only has created arab hatred against itself by sponsoring
organizations which oppress the arabs - but the US has also been
instramental in setting up the very infrastructure Ben Laden has used to
train these "terrorists".
My greatest fear is that the american people are going to go to war.  A
war which will inevitably be imported onto US soil.  How many Timothy
Mcveis are there ticking in america.  And how many arab extremists are in
the U.S.
But in the worst case senariou maybe this has to happen.  Maybe america
need to feel the impact of terror that Israeli citizens has felt in order
for it to realize that Democracy and Freedoms are fundamental to all
citizens on this planet - and not a perk based on nationality, creed nor
color.  And I find that possibility very regretable.

Title: Orient Express
   Note: Although this article of Sept. 12 is a little outdated by
   new findings, it certainly offers food for thought!    Orient Express
   By Israel Shamir
   Like the Four Riders of the Apocalypse, the unknown kamikaze
   rode their giant crafts into the two visible symbols of American
   world domination, Wall Street and the Pentagon. They vanished in
   flames and smoke, and we do not yet know who they were. They
   could be practically anybody: American Nationalists, American
   Communists, American Fundamentalist Christians, American
   Anarchists, anybody who rejects the twin gods of the dollar and
   the M-16, who hates the stock market and interventions overseas,
   who dreams of America for Americans, who does not want to
   support the drive for world domination. They could be Native
   Americans returning to Manhattan, or Afro-Americans who still
   have not received compensation for slavery.
   They could be foreigners of practically any extraction, as Wall
   Street and the Pentagon ruined many lives of people all over the
   globe. Germans can remember the fiery holocaust of Dresden with
   its hundreds of thousands of peaceful refugees incinerated by
   the US Air Force. Japanese will not forget the nuclear holocaust
   of Hiroshima. The Arab world still feels the creeping holocaust
   of Iraq and Palestine. Russians and East Europeans feel the
   shame of Belgrade avenged. Latin Americans think of American
   invasions of Panama and Granada, of destroyed Nicaragua and
   defoliated Colombia. Asians count their dead of Vietnam war,
   Cambodia bombings, Laos CIA operations in millions. Even a
   pro-American, Russian TV broadcaster could not refrain from
   saying, `now Americans begin to understand the feelings of
   Baghdad and Belgrade'.
   The Riders could be anybody who lost his house to the bank, who
   was squeezed from his work and made permanently unemployed, who
   was declared an Untermensch by the new Herrenvolk. They could be
   Russians, Malaysians, Indonesians, Pakistanis, Congolese, as
   their economy was destroyed by Wall Street and the Pentagon.
   They could be anybody, and they are everybody. Their identity is
   quite irrelevant, but the Jews already decided: it has to be
   Arabs.
   One would think, after Oklahoma, we should become less hasty
   with our conclusions. But my countrymen, Israeli politicians are
   impatient folk. The flames in Manhattan did not die out yet,
   they started political profit taking. Mr Ehud Barak came live on
   BBC, and said `Arafat' within three minutes flat. On CNN, his
   twin Bibi Natanyahu appropriated the blame to Arabs, Muslims,
   Palestinians. Shimon Peres, an old wizened wizard, spoke against
   suicide as a psychiatric adviser, reminding his audience of
   Palestinian attacks. He looked worried: it is hard to enslave
   people who are not afraid to die. This old killer of Kana even
   mentioned Gospels. Density of Israelis on the air approached the
   saturation point. They insinuated and incited, pushing their
   shopping list into a chalk-white face of shell-shocked America:
   please, destroy Iran! And Iraq! And Libya, plees!
   The first twenty four hours of maximal exposure were utilised by
   the Jewish propaganda machine to its utmost. Not a single fact
   was yet known, but racist anti-Arab slurs became a commonplace.
   While we Jews quite reasonably object to any reference to the
   Jewishness of a bad guy, we really do not mind producing
   revolting racist drivel of our own. A good Jewish-American
   activist, James Jordan, warned in al-Awda: "Making broad,
   all-inclusive statements and insinuations about "Jews"
   completely marginalizes and discredits your organization". But
   how come the endless stream of 'broad, all-inclusive statements
   and insinuations', about 'the Arabs' did not 'completely
   marginalized and discredited' the Jewish organisations and media
   who practice it? Apparently, it is a Jewish right to decide who
   will be marginalized in America and who will not.
   The connection was in the minds. The American Jewish
   supremacists want to turn all the world into Palestine, where
   the natives will enjoy harsh local rule and limited local
   rights, while the master race will have a rather different level
   of life. Israel is just a small-scale model of their new brave
   world of globalisation.
   As there were no hard facts against Palestinians, the Israelis
   made their damnedest from the scenes of joy shot in East
   Jerusalem. It is a rather weak point, and I'll tell you why. In
   Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express, her favourite
   detective M. Poireau encounters an unusual complication: all
   passengers on board the train have had a good reason to bump off
   the unpleasant old lady. My dear American friends, your leaders
   placed your great country into the old lady's shoes.
   Israelis used the event to the max. They even killed some ten
   Palestinians and destroyed five Goyiish houses in Jerusalem. The
   reports were rather gleeful, in the style `we told you', and the
   experts of Israeli TV concluded by one o'clock, the attack `was
   good for the Jews'. Why? It would strengthen American support of
   Israel.
   The kamikaze attack could do exactly that. America could enter a
   new cycle of violence in its troubled relations with the world.
   Revenge will follow revenge, until one of the sides will be
   obliterated by nuclear blast. It appears president Bush prefers
   this course. He declared war on his and Israel's adversaries.
   Bush did not even understand that the war was declared by the US
   many years ago, only now it started to come home. So many people
   are sick of America's ham-fisted approach, that the countdown
   for the next attack began.
   Alternatively, America could see this painful strike at her Wall
   Street and her Pentagon, as the last call to repent. She should
   change her advisers, and build her relations with the world
   afresh, on equal footing. Probably she should rule in the
   domination-obsessed Jewish supremacist elites of Wall Street and
   media, part company with the apartheid Jewish state. She could
   become again the universally loved, rather parochial America of
   Walt Whitman and Thomas Edison, Henry Ford and Abe Lincoln.

HEADLINE: America Unites
How Should the U.S. Bring Terrorists to Justice?
GUESTS: Sam Husseini, Francis Boyle
BYLINE: Bill O'Reilly
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM
AND MAY BE UPDATED. O'REILLY: While most Americans are united in their support of
President Bush and the desire to bring Osama bin Laden and other
terrorists to justice, there are some differing voices. Joining us now from Washington is Sam Husseini, the former spokesman
for the Arab Anti -- American Anti-Discrimination Committee, and
from Urbana, Illinois, is Francis Boyle, an international law
professor at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign..........  ....  O'REILLY: Cut his mike. All right, now, Mr. Boyle, Professor Boyle,
let's have a little bit more of a rational discussion here. That was
The United States now has to take action against certain segments in
this world who we know have been harbouring people like Osama bin
Laden. That's going to happen. How will you react to that?
FRANCIS BOYLE, LAW PROFESSOR: Well, first I think you have to look
at the law involved. Clearly what we have here, under United States
domestic law and statutes, is an act of international terrorism that
should be treated as such. It is not yet elevated to an act of war. For an act of war, we need proof that a foreign state actually
ordered or launched an attack upon the United States of America. So
far, we do not yet have that evidence. We could...
O'REILLY: All right, now why are you, why are you, why are you
taking this position when you know forces have attacked the United
States. Now, maybe they don't have a country, but they are forces.
They have attacked the United States, all right? Without warning,
without provocation. Civilian targets. They've done everything that
an act of war does. So, I'm saying that because we live in a different world now, where
borders don't really matter, where terrorism is the weapon of
choice, that you would declare war -- if I were President Bush, I
would declare war on any hostile forces, notice those words,
professor, hostile forces to the United States. I would have a
blanket declaration of war so I could go in and kill those people.
Would I be wrong? BOYLE: Well, Bill, so far you'll note Congress has been unwilling to
declare war. And indeed, this matter is being debated right now.
Right now, it appears that what they are seeking is not a full
declaration of war, but only what we law professors call an
imperfect declaration, which means a limited use of military force
under the War Powers Resolution of 1973. Precisely for the problem that we don't know if any state was
involved and we still do not know who was responsible for this
undoubted terrorist attack upon the United States of America. O'REILLY: All right, but we have the secretary of state saying that
Osama bin Laden now has been linked into and, you know, we don't
have all the intelligence information, as President Bush said today.
He's not going to give us, and he shouldn't, the people of America
all the information that they have. But when the secretary of state
gets up and says, look, we know this guy was involved to some
extent, I believe him. And he's a wanted man, professor. He's been wanted for eight years.
The Clinton administration didn't have the heart to get him and in
the first few months the Bush administration didn't either. We now
know, and you just heard the FBI agent say that Afghanistan has been
involved for years harbouring and training these kinds of people.
Certainly, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Iran, Iraq, those five
countries, certainly have been hostile to the United States and
given safe harbour to these terrorists. That's a fact. BOYLE: Well, let me point out, the secretary of state was very
careful in the words he used. He said Osama bin Laden was a suspect.
He did not accuse him. And, again, under these circumstances... O'REILLY: No, he didn't use the word suspect. He used another word. BOYLE: The account I read in, just off the wire service, said
suspect. But let me continue my point. Under these circumstances,
where we have 5,000 Americans dead and we could have many more
Americans killed in a conflict, we have to be very careful, Congress
and the American people and the president, in not to over-escalate
the rhetoric, here. We have to look at this very rationally. This is a democracy. We
have a right to see what the evidence is and proceed in a very slow
and deliberate manner. O'REILLY: No, we don't. We do not, as a republic, we don't have the
right to see what the evidence is if the evidence is of a national
security situation, as you know. Now, I'm trusting my government to do the right thing, here. I am
trusting. But I think it's beyond a doubt right now, beyond a
reasonable doubt, which is, as you know, a court of law standard,
that there are at least five, North Korea you could put in to, six
states in the world that have harboured continually these
terrorists. Now, we know that this was a well-coordinated effort. Our initial
intelligence shows that some of the people that have been arrested
have ties to Osama bin Laden. We know, as you just heard the FBI
agent say, that the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center was tied
in to a guy who knew bin Laden. So, bin Laden -- I agree with you,
that you don't want to be a hothead. You don't want to overreact.
You don't want to lob a missile at the pharmaceutical plant in the
Sudan, which was terrible, and that was the one good point, or fair
point, that Mr. Husseini made, you don't want to do that. But, on the other hand, professor, I think Americans are rightful,
are right, to demand action against states that we know in the past
have harboured these individuals and there's a warrant out for Osama
bin Laden's arrest. So, if he is in Afghanistan, I would give that
government a couple of days to hand him over, and if they did not,
I'd go in. BOYLE: Well, again. The American people are right. We need to see
the evidence. I remember people saying a generation ago, during the
Vietnam war, I trusted my government. And I think people of my
generation found out that that was wrong. We needed more evidence. O'REILLY: All right. Professor, let me stop you there, though. This
is another point that Mr. Husseini tried to make. Just because the
United States of America has made mistakes in the past, does not
mean that we cannot defend ourselves now. This is a unique situation in history. We have now been attacked by
forces without borders, OK? We've been attacked. And it hasn't been
a military attack, it's been an attack on civilians. The reason, the
sole reason a federal government exists is to protect the people of
the United States. And as I said in my "Talking Points" memo, they
haven't really done the job, for political reasons. But now's the time to correct those things. So, there's going to be
a reckoning, Professor. You know it's going to happen. I know it's
going to happen. And it's going to come down on Osama bin Laden
first and maybe some of these rouge states later. Will you support
that action? BOYLE: Before I support a war that will jeopardize the lives of tens
of thousands of our servicemen and women, I want to see the evidence
that we are relying on to justify this. So far, I do not see it. I
see allegations. I see innuendo. I see winks and I see nods, but I
do not see the evidence that you need under international law and
the United States constitution so far to go to war. Maybe that
evidence will be there, but it is not there now. My recommendation to Congress is to slow down, let's see what
develops and let's see what this evidence is before we knowingly go
out and not only kill large numbers of people, perhaps in
Afghanistan and other countries, but undoubtedly in our own armed
forces. 58,000 men of my generation will killed in Vietnam because of
irresponsible behavior by the Johnson administration rushing that
Tonkin Gulf resolution through Congress, exactly what we're seeing
now. And we need to pull back and stop and think and ask the hard
questions and demand to see the evidence first, before we march off
to war. O'REILLY: All right, so it's not enough that people arrested in the
bombings of the embassies in Africa testified in court that Osama
bin Laden was behind and financed and coordinated those bombings.
That evidence is not enough for you? BOYLE: Well, Africa is a very is a very different story than what
happened in the World Trade Center. O'REILLY: No, it's not. He's wanted, he's wanted in the United
States for the bombings of those two embassies. Is that evidence
enough for you, professor, for the United States to go in and get
this man? Is it enough? BOYLE: That, that matter was treated and handled as an act of
international terrorism in accordance with the normal laws and
procedures of the United States of America as a question of domestic
and international law enforcement. And I am suggesting that is the
way we need to proceed here... O'REILLY: Well, wait. You're dodging the question professor. BOYLE: ... unless we have evidence that... O'REILLY: Wait, professor. Professor. This is a no spin zone. Hold
it. Hold it. Even out in Urbana Champagne, the no spin zone rules.
You're dodging the question. There is an absolutely rock solid
arrest warrant out for this man. Evidence in court, testimony by
people who did the bombings that this man was behind it. Is that
enough evidence for you to have the United States go in and get him
now? Is it enough? BOYLE: The United States has been attempting to secure his
extradition from Afghanistan. I support... O'REILLY: Yeah, that's long enough. BOYLE: I support that approach as international... O'REILLY: Come on already, I mean, eight years, we've been
attempting to extradite this guy. Now's the time to tell the Afghans
you've got 48 hours or 72 hours to turn him over. You don't turn him
over, we're coming in and getting him. You try to stop us, and
you're toast. Enough is enough, professor. BOYLE: That's vigilantism. It is not what the United States of
America is supposed to stand for. We are supposed to stand... O'REILLY: No, what that is is protecting the country from terrorists
who kill civilians. BOYLE: ... for rule of law. O'REILLY: It's not vigilantism. BOYLE: We are supposed to stand for rule of law, and that is clearly
vigilantism. There is a Security Council, there is Congress, there
are procedures and there are laws, and they are there to protect all
of us here in the United States as well as... O'REILLY: So, you're telling me... BOYLE: ... as well as our servicemen and women. Look, Bill, if we
allegedly, as you put it, go in, you are not going in, I am not
going in. It's going to be young men and women serving in our armed
forces... O'REILLY: And that's their job. To protect us. But, professor, let
me, you know, what you're saying is, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold it. Hold
it. Hold it. Hold it. B0YLE: ... with the constitution and the laws of the United States. O'REILLY: We're not violating any laws here, professor. No one is
going to violate the law. There is going to be a state of war
induced against states, states, terroristic states, who have
attacked us. And what you're saying is, though, and correct me if
I'm wrong, you're saying that even though there is a legitimate
warrant out for Osama bin Laden's arrest, and even though most
civilized nations would honor that warrant and turn him over to us,
extradite him to us, the vast majority of nations on earth would do
that, you still are opposed for the United States to demand that the
Taliban government arrest this man and turn him over? You are
opposed to that? BOYLE: During the Gulf War, President Bush's father, who has far
more experience that the current president Bush, got a Security
Council resolution authorizing the United States of America to use
force to expel Iraq from Kuwait. Second, President Bush's father got
a War Powers Authorization Resolution from Congress that gave him
the constitutional authority to use military force to enforce that
Security Council resolution. What I'm calling for here is the same adherence to international law
and the United States constitution that the first President Bush
adhered to in dealing with Iraq. O'REILLY: Well, you'll get that, professor. That's just a formality.
There -- nobody on Capitol Hill right now, they're not going to --
there's no profile of courages up there anyway, usually. They're
going to give President Bush what he wants. If he wants a War Powers
Act, they're going to give it to him. He wants a declaration,
they're going to give it to him. BOYLE: Actually, they're arguing about it right now... O'REILLY: They're going to give it to him. But I'm not interested in
that, because it's going to happen. It's going to happen. BOYLE: The reports -- no, the reports I read was that this President
Bush initially asked for a blank check, and Congress balked because
they had been suckered once before... O'REILLY: All right, I'm not -- speculation is not what I'm in --
all right, professor. I don't want to speculate. I'm just going to
say in my opinion he's going to have the authority to go in and get
Osama bin Laden and his pals, wherever they are. He will get that
authority, whether it takes a day or a week, he'll get it. And once
he gets it, now, that's what I want to talk about here. Once he gets
it, are you and others like you going to say, oh, no, we shouldn't
do this, even though we have proof of the man's -- masterminded the
bombings in Africa and the Cole,testimony in Yemen, are you going to
still say, even after the authority is granted by Congress, which it
will be, no, don't do it, let Afghanistan handle him? Are you going
to still do that, professor? BOYLE: Second, like his father, his father also got authorization
from the United States, the United Nations Security Council under
chapter seven of the United Nations charter... O'REILLY: Oh, you want to go to U.N. now? You want the U.N. involved
now. BOYLE: Is exactly what his father did... O'REILLY: So what? BOYLE: And that's exactly right. O'REILLY: His father made a huge mistake by not taking out Sadam
Hussein when he could of. BOYLE: His father adhered to the required procedures under the
United States constitution and the United Nations charter that is a
treaty and the supreme law of our land. I expect the current
President Bush to do exactly what his father did before he starts
engaging in a massive military campaign in Iraq or against other
countries... O'REILLY: All right, I don't know whether he's going to go -- I know
he's not going to let the U.N. dictate. He might go for a consensus.
He's already got it with Putin and all of our NATO allies, he's
already go that.  Whether he goes -- I think it would be a mistake
to let -- empowering the U.N. in this situation. BOYLE: Then why did his father do this? O'REILLY: I'm going -- we're going to wrap this up with this. I'm
going to give my last summation and then you can give yours, I'll
give you the last word on it. This is a fugitive we're dealing with here. He has now been tied in
by U.S.  intelligence agencies, according to Attorney General
Ashcroft and the secretary of state, tied into this horrendous
bombing here in New York. The United States must make a response to
this, and I am agreeing with you in a sense, it can't be a
knee-jerk. It's got to be done in a methodical way. Congress will go along, they may debate it or whatever, but they
will go along in either a War Powers, special War Powers Act or a
declaration of war against forces hostile to the United States. Then
they will go in and they will take him. This man you're looking at
on the TV screen is a dead man. He should be a dead man. You don't
do what he did and be allowed to walk around this earth. Now, I'm distressed, professor, by your reliance, reliance on the
strict letter of propriety, when we've got 10,000 people laying in
the street about 22 miles from me right now. I want deliberation. I
want methodical discipline, but I also want action. We know who this
guy is. We know the governments that are protecting him. We know the
other rouge states that have terrorist camps there. They all have to
be dealt with, in my opinion. I'll give you the last word. BOYLE: Sure, I agree with you, Bill. He is a fugitive from justice
and this should be handled as a matter as other fugitives from
justice of international law enforcement. If indeed there is
evidence that a foreign state orchestrated and ordered an attack
against the United States then clearly that is an act of war that
should be dealt with as such... O'REILLY: What about harbouring? BOYLE: Right now... O'REILLY: Is harbouring an act of war? BOYLE: In my opinion, no. And under the current circumstances, I
don't see it. O'REILLY: All right, professor. BOYLE: I think there is a distinction here. O'REILLY: OK, all right, wrap it up, if you would. BOYLE: I agree -- I agree that the -- if we go to war in a hasty
manner here, we could see thousands of U.S. military personnel being
killed without proper authorization by Congress or by the United
Nations Security Council. O'REILLY: OK. BOYLE: Our founding fathers decided that the most awesome decision
we would ever make would be to go to war, and we have to be very
careful in making that decision. O'REILLY: All right, professor, I appreciate it very much. Thank you
for your point of view. BOYLE: Thank you, Bill. Francis A. Boyle Law Building 504 E. Pennsylvania Ave. Champaign, IL 61820 USA 217-333-7954(voice)  217-244-1478(fax) fboyle at law.uiuc.edu

@_subject: Robert Fisk on Suicide Bombers (fwd) 
Email: Nader Hashemi Title: Robert Fisk on Suicide Bombers
The Independent Thursday, September 13, 2001 They can run and they can hide. Suicide bombers are here to stay
By Robert Fisk
Not long before the Second World War, Stanley Baldwin, who was
Britain's Prime Minister, warned that "the bomber will always get
through". Today, we can argue that the suicide bomber will always
get through. Maybe not all of them. We may never know how many
other hijackers failed to board domestic flights in the United
States on Tuesday morning, but enough to produce carnage on an
awesome, incomprehensive scale. Yet still we have not begun to
address this phenomenon. The suicide bomber is here to stay. It is
an exclusive weapon that belongs to "them" not us, and no military
power appears able to deal with this phenomenon.
Partly because of the suicide bomber, the Israelis fled Lebanon.
Specifically because of a suicide bomber, the Americans fled
Lebanon 17 years earlier. I still remember Vice-President George
Bush, now George Bush Senior, visibly moved amid the ruins of the
US Marine base in Beirut, where 241 American servicemen had just
been slaughtered. "We are not going to let a bunch of insidious
terrorist cowards, shake the foreign policy of the United States,"
he told us. "Foreign policy is not going to be dictated or changed
by terror." A few months later, the Marines upped sticks and ran
away from Lebanon, "redeployed" to their ships offshore.
Not long ago, I was chatting to an Indian soldier, a veteran of
Delhi's involvement in the Sri Lanka war now serving with the UN in
southern Lebanon. How did the Tamil suicide bombers compare those
of the Lebanese Hizbollah I asked him? The soldier raised his
eyebrows. "The Hizbollah has nothing on those guys," he said. "Just
think, they all carry a suicide capsule. I told my soldiers to
drive at 100 miles an hour on the roads of Sri Lanka in case one of
them hurled himself into the jeep." The Hizbollah may take their
inspiration from the martyrdom of the prophet Hussain, and the
Palestinian suicide bombers may take theirs from the Hizbollah.
But there is no military answer to this. As long as "our" side will
risk but not give its lives (cost-free war, after all, was partly
an American invention) the suicide bomber is the other side's
nuclear weapon. That desperate, pitiful phone call from the
passenger on her way to her doom in the Boeing 767 crash on the
Pentagon told her husband that the hijackers held knives and
box-cutters. Knives and box-cutters; that's all you need now to
inflict a crashing physical defeat on a superpower. That and a
plane with a heavy fuel load.
But the suicide bomber does not conform to a set of identical
characteristics. Many of the callow Palestinian youths blowing
themselves to bits, with, more often than not, the most innocent of
Israelis, have little or no formal education. They have poor
knowledge of the Koran but a powerful sense of fury, despair and
self-righteousness to propel them. The Hizbollah suicide bombers
were more deeply versed in the Koran, older, often with years of
imprisonment to steel them in the hours before their immolation.
Tuesday's suicide bombers created a precedent. If there were at
least four on each aircraft, this means 16 men decided to kill
themselves at the same time. Did they all know each other?
Unlikely. Or did one of them know all the rest? For sure, they were
educated. If the Boeing which hit the Pentagon was being flown by
men with knives (presumably, the other three aircraft were too)
then these were suicide bombers with a good working knowledge of
the fly-by-wire instrument panel of one of the world's most
sophisticated aircraft.
I found it oddly revealing when, a few hours later, an American
reporter quizzed me about my conviction that these men must have
made "dummy runs", must have travelled the same American Airlines
and United Airlines scheduled flights many times. They would have
to do that at least to check the X-ray security apparatus at
airports. How many crew, the average passenger manifest, the
average delays on departure times. They needed to see if the cabin
crew locked the flight deck door. In my experience on US domestic
flights this is rare. Savage, cruel these men were, but also, it
seems, educated.
Like so many of our politicians who provide us with the same tired
old promises about hunting down the guilty and, Mr Blair's
contribution yesterday, "dismantle the machine of terror". But this
misses the point. If the machinery is composed of knives and
box-cutters, Mr Blair is after the wrong target. Just as President
Ronald Reagan was in the hours before he ordered the bombing of
Libya in 1986. "He can run, but he can't hide," he said of Colonel
Muammar Gaddafi. But Colonel Gaddafi could hide, and he is still
with us.
Instead of searching for more rogue states, President George W
Bush's reference to those who stand behind the bombers opens the
way for more cruise missiles aimed at Iraq or Afghanistan, or
wherever he thinks the "godfathers of terrorism may be". The
Americans might do better to find out who taught these vicious men
to fly a Boeing 767.
Which Middle East airlines train their pilots for this aircraft?
Indeed which nations are generous in their pilot-training schemes
for Third World countries? I recall one of Iran's best
post-revolutionary helicopter pilots telling me he was given a full
course on the Bell Augusta (the Vietnam-era gunship) by the
Pakistan air force, which itself paid retired American pilots to
teach them.
And if Osama bin Laden is behind the New York massacre, it's worth
remembering one of his aims: not just to evict the US from the
Middle East but to overthrow the Arab regimes loyal to Washington.
Saudi Arabia was top of the list when I last spoke to him, but
President Hosni Mubarak's Egypt and Jordan, ruled by King Abdullah
II, were among his other enemies. He would keep talking about how
the Muslims of these nations would rise up against their corrupt
rulers. A slaughter by the US in retaliation for the New York and
Washington bloodbaths might just move the Arab masses from stubborn
docility to the point of detonation.
Within the region, the suicide bomber is now admired. Not because
he is a mass killer but because something invincible, something
untouchable, something that has always dictated the rules without
taking responsibility for the results, has now proved vulnerable.
It was the same when the first suicide bombers struck in Lebanon.
The Lebanese could scarcely believe that Israeli soldiers could die
on this scale. The Israeli army of song and legend had been brought
low. So, too, the reaction when the symbols of America's pride and
power were struck. The vile, if small, Palestinian "celebrations"
were a symptom of this, albeit unrepresentative. They matched the
"bomb Baghdad into the Dark Ages" rhetoric we heard from the
American public a decade ago.
In the Middle East, Arabs now fear America will strike them without
waiting for proof, or act on the most flimsy of evidence. For it is
as well to remember how the US responded to the 1983 Marine
bombings. The battleship USS New Jersey fired its automobile-sized
shells into the Chouf Mountains, killing a couple of Syrian
soldiers and erasing half a village. The arrival of US naval craft
off the American East Coast yesterday was a ghostly replay of this
impotent event.
But to this day, the Americans have never discovered the identity
of the man who drove a truck-load of explosives into the Beirut
Marine compound. That was in another country, in another time.
Today's suicide bombers are a different breed. Nurtured in whatever
despair or misery or perhaps even privilege, in 2001, the suicide
bomber came of age.

Stern-Intel (Canada). A US military intelligence source revealed
details of an internal intelligence memo that points to the
Israeli Mossad intelligence service having links to the World
Trade Center and Pentagon attacks. The intelligence source, who
requested his name be withheld, confirmed the internal US
intelligence memo circulated four weeks ago described information
that pointed to the threat of a covert Israeli operation on US
soil to turn mass public opinion against Palestinian Arabs via an
apparent terrorist attack on US interests that would give Israel
the green light to implement a large scale military onslaught
against the Palestinian Arab population.
The 11 September attack has been described by experts as being too
sophisticated for a lone terrorist group to execute. This attack
required a high level of military precision and the resources of
an advanced intelligence agency. In addition, the attackers would
have needed to be extremely familiar with both air force one
flight operations, civil airline flight paths and aerial assault
tactics on sensitive US cities like Washington, Stated David Stern
an expert on Israeli intelligence operations.
The attacks targeted the Pentagon, World Trade Center towers, with
the white house and air force also being targets according to the
The attacks have certainly turned US public opinion firmly back
in Israel's favor after 11 months of Palestinian uprising, heavy
criticism of Israel
over war crimes allegations and racism by a UN conference in
Durban. The attacks serve no Arab group or nations interests but
their timing came in the midst of international condemnation of
Israel for its policy of death squad assassination of Palestinian
political and police figures, added Stern.
If verified, the news of Israels involvement in the US attack
will come as no surprise to intelligence experts. The state of
Israel has a long history of covert operations against Western
targets with attacks on the King David Hotel, USS Liberty, murder
of a Scandinavian UN envoy as well as espionage against the US
during the Jonathan Pollard case.
On Wednesday the US defense department issued a warning to its
officials to halt the leak of information on the investigation
which it says is happening on a daily basis since the attacks

for the soviets during their occupation and the exact same will apply to
any american action there.
US military advisors have already made this clear.

It seems you have alot to say - unfortunately no knowledge of what you are
talking about.
As I made clear to Declan - I was there from the beginning of the Soviet
invasion.  I was there when the americans began active sponsorship of the
various mujahadin - including our evacuation of children maimed by the
soviets.  An evacuation which was mainly supported by the US military.
Ben Laden was in fact there at the begining and he was actively supported
by the US Military.  They were the best of friends at the time.  The
support was in weapons and included strategic assistance against the
soviet red army.
Laden does not hate freedom - he was a "freedom fighter" and has an
excellent reputation in the arab world as being a freedom fighter.
Your military analysis of the Soviets is also out to lunch.  The soviets
expended a considerable number of military resources and were rewarded
with lots of body bags in return for their efforts.
Nikolai Kovalyov, the former head of the Russian FSB security service, has
just warned the US that an attack on Afghanistan would fail to capture
Osama bin Laden, and would backfire on the US. "In Afghanistan's mountainous terrain it takes a trainload of explosives to destroy three militants," he said. "The chance of hitting bin Laden is zero."
So in short James - if the U.S. invades - get the body bags ready.
I find it insulting James that you would argue from an ignorant position
and just say things off the top of your head without any idea of the
consequences involved.  As I have said before, the only way to win a war
in afganistan is to nuke it.  And I predict that will bring the nukes to
american soil - if they are not there already.
This is a serious situation james.  Alot of boys are going to die as a
result of this invasion and it's ignorant people like yourself who fuel
the fires of victory which some day like vietnam will end up bringing
shame to the american public.  This is not a game james - this is
reality.  A harsh reality that if ignored will result in more pain and
suffering in america.

I just received an urgent message from Mr. Fred Leuchter, who has traveled the nation for many years as a consultant for execution methods.  His job is to review and improve the instruments by which the death penalty is imposed in each state.
If you are like me, you probably wonder why a person would concentrate his life on instruments of death when he doesn't even believe in the death penalty.  I asked Mr. Leuchter that question and he replied that, but since we insist on employing state sanctioned murder, at least we should be as humane as possible about it.
He's very concerned about an upcoming electrocution in Ohio.  The electric chair there is defective and the death of John Byrd Jr will be exceptionally horrible unless the defects are corrected before the execution.
If you have media and authority contacts in Ohio, get this message to them!

Dear Kay, I have been in touch with Attorney Richard Vickers of the Ohio Public Defenders office in Columbus.  He represents John Byrd, Jr. who is about to  be electrocuted in a chair with defective electrodes and voltages which are too low.  His blood will boil while he is conscious, almost like being burned at the stake in the chair. I have sent him a sworn opinion as to the problems with the chair.  In the meanwhile, a legislator has filed emergency legislation to eliminate the chair entirely.  He can use all the help he can get.  If you can advise your Ohio subscribers to contact their reps and senators to support the legislation it would be helpful.  The Attorney is Richard Vickers, Esquire

long before George Bush became president with his forceful in-your-face,

"DOES TERRORISM REVEAL OUR OWN BARBARISM?"
By Firoze Manji, Fahamu - Learning For Change
Publication of this weeks newsletter was delayed because of the tragedy
that took place on Tuesday in US. All of us were deeply shocked by the loss
of innocent lives by sickening acts of terrorism. Our thoughts are with the
families and survivors of this tragedy whose pain and grief must be immense.
But we also feel a deep sense of unease that the horrors of war and of state
sponsored terror in the south, and especially in Africa, that claim millions
of lives each year, somehow do not register in the same way. Is the
overwhelming response to the current tragedy, then, an expression of shock
that such an event could take place at the heart of the most powerful state
in the world? Or is it that different values are given to human lives
depending on their geography and closeness to capital?
Terrorism always plays into the hands of the Right. It justifies hysteria,
prejudice, bigotry and even the use of terror against sections of humanity
in the name of vengeance rather than justice. The shock, horror and anger at
the attacks in the US is understandable. There is equal anger and despair
amongst the survivors of massacres in Africa  only they are denied the
voice to make their anguish heard.
What is frightening about the reaction in the USA is that these acts of
terror are being used to justify vengeance against the perceived
perpetrators. It took less than a millisecond to point the finger at Islam.
As we go to press, there is still no clarity about who the perpetrators
were. A climate is growing where very soon anyone who is, or ever has been,
a member of an Islamic organisation will be viewed with suspicion and fear.
Such prejudice will be given a boost if it turns out that Bin Laden or some
other extremist Islamic terrorist group was responsible for the attacks in
the USA. Somehow that is seen as understandable. But why is it anymore
understandable than writing off all whites or Christians as potential
terrorists after the Oklahoma bombing?
The US and NATO have declared the attack on the World Trade Centre and the
Pentagon as acts of war. The response, in their view, should be retaliation,
not bringing the perpetrators to justice. But will bombings or invasions of
Afghanistan or Iraq or Sudan or wherever really diminish the potentials of
further acts of terrorism against the US and its allies? Will taking out
what the US believes to be rogue states really diminish the risks? Or will
they only fuel the already burning fires. Can terrorism be countered by
state-sponsored terror without leading to a vicious spiral?
Outside of the US, few are really surprised that the US has become the
target of terrorist attacks. For many, the real rogue state is the US.
American foreign policy, its collusion with and financing despotic and
totalitarian regimes and dictators, its disregard for international
treaties, and, through the international financial and trade institutions,
its profiteering at the expense of the poor  these are really the real
causes of the latest round of attacks on the US. If America is serious about
declaring war that will minimise the threat of further terrorism, then it is
against these causes that it must act. There are severe consequences of US
retaliation that could lead to general destabilisation, especially in the
Middle East, with implications for north Africa and the horn of Africa. The
impending global recession could have serious implications for developing
economies; and further degeneration of international relations. This could
be an opportunity for the west to begin to attend to the causes of such
acts, but are they likely to take it up?
The last decade has seen the rich get richer while the poor get poorer.
While the average income of the top 20% of the world's population was 30
times that of the bottom 20% in 1960, by 1990 it was 60 times, and by 1997,
74 times that of the lowest fifth. By the late 1990s, 20% of the worlds
population had 86% of the world GDP, while the bottom 20% had 1% The assets
of the top 3 billionaires are more than the combined GNP of all least
developed countries and their 600 million people. Nearly one quarter of the
world's people have an income that is less than $1 a day - a proportion that
is rising. The UN Development Programme calculates each year the human
poverty index based on a series of measures including the prevalence of
illiteracy, life expectancy, degree of malnourishment, and access to health
services and safe water. In 1996 over a billion people fell below this
measure, the position worsening in 30 countries - the worst figures since
UNDP began calculating the index in 1990. Unless concerted action is taken
against the growing impoverishment of the majority, then desperation and
frustration will inevitably result in violent reactions such as US has
witnessed these last couple of days.
Terrorism in all its forms must be opposed. But that applies as much to
state-sponsored terrorism as it does to terrorism of armed groups. Last week
saw the conclusion of the World Conference Against Racism that spawned its
own set of contradictions. Why, for example, should the genocidal terror
carried out by Europe during the Slave Trade during which tens of millions
of African were uprooted or killed be viewed as acceptable just because the
perpetrators declare that the act was legal at the time? The whole
Colonial ravage of Africa was little other than legitimised terrorism. Why
was it so difficult at the World Conference on Racism to declare outrage and
condemnation of these vast acts of terrorism in Africa, but so easy to find
our humanity when the act is carried out in New York and Washington?
Does terrorism have the effect of revealing not only the barbarism of the
perpetrators but also of our own value systems?

mata means to kill in spanish and portugese.  your playing around here
with word tenses.  and matar does in no way mean murder.  it does mean
to kill, or to slay.  mata is not an acceptable word usuage in spanish with respect to the process of killing or slaying - it is however in
common usage.  In both languages it is considered a slang term when used
alone.  it can mean murderer or assasine when used as a noun -
i.e. matador.
now i have no idea where you are coming from in your claims that mata has
anything to do with plants.  i suspect many portions of the old spanish
empire may have mutated their language usage where mata has some reference
to plants - but i doubt it.
I think what you are doing here is confusing spanish with portuguese.  In
portuguese mata can in fact refer to a forest, woods or a jungle area.  and in association with other common terms can mean various things.  i.e. mata + borrao = paper blotters, rato(s) derived from rat =
arsenic, virgem = virgin or primeval forest.  I think thats where your
confusing your spanish definition of mata that it has some association
