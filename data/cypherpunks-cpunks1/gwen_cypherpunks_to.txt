@_subject: Just to make your life more paranoid:)  Re: Surreptitious Tor 
Troll Mode on:
TOR was originally developed as a result of CIA/NRL funding:)
compile your own client and examine sources if you have this particular brand of paranoia(I do)
change to an OS which makes this easy ...
BTW running TOR makes you very visible that you are running tor even as a client.. its quite a noisy protocol
Troll Mode off:

@_subject: Human scum in the crypto/security industry industry 
lots of Human scum, snake oil peddlers etc in my industry,
back at Sunsoft in 1994 I used to have to work with
 as he was writing the initial
versions of Firewall-1(was being done on Solaris 2.4 at the time).
He had a desk in Bldg 5 at Sunsoft also
Gil as Wikipedia states( and as
Bamford writes was a member of the Mossad linked Unit 8200.  He was
extremely eager to get FW-1(which Sun had NO source to at that time)
into the hands of Sun Customers.. LOTS of SUN customers.
And given what I was doing at the time for the 5 Sun Companies, I was a
Sun Industrial Relations 'skunk' as in skunkworks there was a bit of
pressure for me to use Fw-1 at my offsite lab(s) and my home lab(NOT), I
already had alternatives.
Fortunately as I was also working with SunLabs we had internally
developed alternatives which we did control all sources for
ie Sunscreen-1, unfortunately there was an insistance we use BSAFE(which
I ALWAYS had a LOT of resistance to) for the SKIP crypto tunnels, as we
are coming to find out..  there were evil reasons for this. Skip had
some internal defenses against such skulduggery such as rapidly
switching out keys.. use of DH.. and both Ashar Aziz and Whit Diffie had
their hand in the design. But if there were flaws in the random number
gen that were not known to us then this puts a whole different light on
things like none of the defenses mean anything when keys were predictable.
     and I used to think John Young had finally skipped over the edge
John My apologies..
      Fucking SNAKE OIL salesmen
       gwen
ps its becoming VERY obvious to me that RSA Inc. and Jim Bidzos were
filthy from the start. I thought an AG-Crypto was being run on us but I
was told I was being overly paranoid and to take off my tin foil hat(NOT).

@_subject: Boycott the RSA Conference - List of Honor 
Well Kids,
    the RSA Conference is coming to the Bay area yet again,
So far F-secure is worthy of Honor they have chosen to boycott the
conference, as EVERY HONEST security and crypto firm/personnel should
 do.. the next few months will tell both us and the public who we can
start to put on the naughty or nice lists..
Bravo to F-Secure and  Mikko Hypponen, the beginning of Honest security
consulting firms..
 his reason quoted below
“I don’t really expect your multibillion dollar company or your
multimillion dollar conference to suffer as a result of your deals with
the NSA. In fact, I'm not expecting other conference speakers to cancel.
Most of your speakers are american anyway – why would they care about
surveillance that’s not targeted at them but at non-americans.
Surveillance operations from the US intelligence agencies are targeted
at foreigners. However I’m a foreigner. And I’m withdrawing my support
from your event.”
And Trevor Pott Journalist from the Register is also boycotting..
Let the honor roll grow!!
