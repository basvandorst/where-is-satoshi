@_subject: "Unbreakable Crypto" announcement?? 
Who would have guessed that a journalist would so grievously misrepresent
the claims of a soberly presented scholarly report? The title of the
technical paper is: "A Practical Public Key Cryptosystem Provably Secure
against Adaptive Chosen Ciphertext Attack". The only new claim is security
against a chosen ciphertext attack, not "unbreakable". The specific
internet angle is that an attacker might have access to a "decryption
oracle" due to the nature of high volume anonymous transactions. If one
could slip through a few million adaptively chosen ciphertexts, current
systems could leak enough information to compromise themselves. The
reported results are for a new proposed system that is not vulnerable to
this sort of attack.

@_subject: DES Ecryption 
This may not be the absolute best place to start but it is certainly current:
This describes the efforts made to show why a 56 bit key for DES is just
too short for many purposes. You can probably branch out from links you
find there to get more details about S-boxes and other topics.

@_subject: Matt Blaze arrested??? 
Not a important question but isn't this the sort of message that would
benefit most from a PGP signature? I checked on the certserver and it did
locate a 512 bit key RSA key from 1993. I don't routinely sign or encrypt
my email but I remain curious about decisions others make. In a program on
NPR a few years ago I recall a few luminaries were ardently discussing the
issues involved in encryption but when asked late in the program how they
used encrryption themselves they all quickly said that it was just too

@_subject: Web TV with 128b exported 
This announcement seems to be getting a lot of this sort of reaction but I
don't see quite why the news is greeted with such animosity. If a duly
authorized search warrant is required in order to obtain information that
represents a potential world of difference from having unrestricted ability
to monitor all communications.

@_subject: FYI: More on WebTV security 
Has anyone hacked WebTV to enable a terminal to connect to a plain vanilla
ISP (or better yet a local ethernet) or is it inexorably tied to their
network of proxy servers? I get the impression that like a Newton or any
other graphically limited device a WebTV browser would have to be aided by
a proxy server that translates the content to more amenable form before it
can take a crack at it. If it were possible to divorce it from their
service it might be a nifty device for less than $100. This would become
especially appealing if 128 bit crypto were thrown into the bargain.

@_subject: Is it true that PGP 5.X is not secure? 
Why pay attention to ill-supported rumors? The source code is publicly
available at  If there is a security issue then it can be
critiqued with reference to the places in the source code that are the
cause of the problem. If someone has done this, I haven't been paying close
enough attention and I apologize for ranting. If not, then I would dismiss
such claims as almost certainly baseless.

@_subject: Bits are Bits 
Another weird twist in this topic is the "distinction" that is made between
video games for consoles and the same games for computers. It is legal to
rent a PSX title such as Tomb Raider but the same title ported to the PC is
not legal to rent. I read about this a few years ago in an article by Trip
Hawkins, CEO of 3DO, so maybe this information is out of date. But I have
not yet seen CD-ROMs for rent or even available to check out for home use
from the public library. I think this distinction is sometimes confused
because a publisher can choose to allow a CD-ROM title to be rentable but
has to explicitly sanction that. But a publisher of game console CD's
cannot prevent its products from being rented.

They have CD-ROM's at our local public library but only for use at the
library. It isn't possible to check them out for use at home. I don't know
if this is a legal issue or just a matter of policy but it is annoying.

@_subject: Clinton's fake apologies (fwd) 
I know it's a mistake to reply to this stuff but it would be nice for
someone to maintain the context. Clinton was on trial for sexual
harrassment. When giving testimony under oath he chose to lie in order to
cover his own ass. I don't much care about the private lives of politicians
but I do care how they behave in public places like courts of law. That is
what he is trouble for, not for his filandering proclivities which were
public known before he became president. Just to help the Clintonites
understand: "It's about perjury, stupid!"
