WikiLeaks R Us
We can't put the Internet genie back in the bottle.
By DANIEL HENNINGER
There is one certain fix for the WikiLeaks problem: Blow up the Internet.
Short of that, there is no obvious answer.
This summer I was in a movie line behind two guys, and one said: "I hate
Facebook. I wish it had never been invented. But I can't live without it."
Welcome to the WikiLeaks problem, which was born along with the Internet
itself. What we can't live without may kill us.
In October, the Secret Service arrested a Malaysian man in New York who
had 400,000 bank-card numbers. He'd hacked them out of the Cleveland
Federal Reserve and other financial institutions. Last year a contractor
remotely inserted a potentially destructive "logic bomb" on Fannie Mae's
servers that could have erased a lot of its data.
What about your co-worker? Two years ago, a worker in the City of San
Francisco's technology department created a password that let him access
virtually all the city's files and business on its FiberWAN network, while
blocking access to everyone else. They caught him, but for a while he held
the city hostage, refusing to give up his key to the city.
Can Bank of America say with certainty they haven't been robbed of the
data Julian Assange claims to possess? No, they can't. Once you input
anything into the digital ethers, it will never be "safe" or "private."
Sun Microsystems' co-founder Scott McNealy famously said: "You have zero
privacy. Get over it." We know that. What we don't know, or won't admit,
is that the idea of confidentialityState Department cables, the design
for weapons systems, health recordshas eroded, perhaps permanently.
We can't put the Internet genie back in the bottle.
Everyone from Hillary Clinton on down is "shocked" at the cables dump. But
if last year one had polled experts on the architecture of data systems
about the probability of this event, most would have said it surely would
happen, eventually.
The Government Accountability Office has released survey after survey on
this problem, all singing the same song printed on the front of this
June's report: "Cybersecurity: Key Challenges Need to Be Addressed."
Congress has thrown dozens of bills at cybersecurity.
Is WikiLeaks Obama's fault? No. You could throw the entire IQ capacity of
Google's work force at the problem. They might devise a solution, but it
wouldn't be the answer. Like the Web itself, it's complicated.
Private companies already offer solutions to protecting data systems.
"Data-at-rest" and "data-in-motion" programs look for anomalies in emails
and other data moving through networks or resting on hard drives. SIM
(security information management) software tracks network intrusions. It's
pretty good, the way climatology is pretty good.
But there's a maddening paradox that this technology poses to any
organized group of people trying to use it for good ends: How to set up
protocols that will haul in the bad guys without hampering the creative
work of everyone else?
If the U.S. (or Europe) has one big comparative advantage left, it is an
information advantage. Out of the organized serendipity of many smart
people bouncing information-laden ideas off each other, good things happen
here. Whether workers in a knowledge society are creating advances on
cancer or software for the pilotless drones killing our worst enemies,
they need lots of information, need it now, and need to "talk" about it on
the network with colleagues. That means "odd" but legitimate events are
going to occur on one's data network. Separating all the odd from one bad
is hard.
China's security solution is to suppress the flow of information, let
creativity be damned, and steal from us. (The New York Times's Thomas
Friedman yesterday asked: "What if China had a WikiLeaker?" The three-word
answer: They'd execute him.)
The Pentagon, State Department and our banks are at risk because it is
hard to define who or what should be monitored. Then each institution
would have to create an Orwellian "monitoring" office. Oh wait, we already
did thatthe Department of Homeland Security. Problem solved.
After 9/11, non-communicating, "stove-piped" federal agencies emerged as a
top problem. To open the cross-agency information flow of classified
information they created SIPRNet. Now the State Department has pulled the
plug on SIPRNet. Ponder this: The CIA never joined SIPRNet and took heat
for that. Count me as glad that Assange doesn't have access to data on the
agency's anti-Taliban drone program.
Two big things transformed the postwar world: nuclear fission and the
Internet. Nuclear fission gave us clean energy and the atomic bomb. The
Internet? With WikiLeaks, we arrive at the Internet version of putting the
nuclear genie back in the bottle.
There may be no obvious fix for the paradoxes of this inherently
vulnerable technology. But we also can't survive in a digital state of
nature. The Internet "A-bomb" will go off eventually. Here's a thought for
our befuddled national leadership: The first time humans concluded that
they needed to deter bad people from taking advantage of civilization,
they set common rules. If people broke them, they put them away.
Pfc. Bradley Manning, charged with downloading all that data for Assange,
is sitting in a Quantico jail. He could get 52 years. He should. And
that's just for starters, if we hope to live with the Internet genie.

Website for Leaked Data Shines Spotlight on WikiLeaks
By JEANNE WHALEN
WikiLeaks publishes top-secret documents about government and corporate
Then there is John Young, who publishes documents about WikiLeaks.
architect, computer buff and self-described "cypherpunk" runs a website,
 that seeks to hold accountable the site that boasts
of holding others to account.
Mr. Young said his scrutiny is meant not to undermine WikiLeaks, but to
harden it for battle. "Doing what they're doing," he said in a telephone
interview, "they have to be just as tough as nails. And they can't get
tough by having people praise them. They can only get tough by having
people attack them."
WikiLeaks has posted hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. military
documents about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with the most recent
trove released last weekend. Among the posts on Mr. Young's sitewhich
covers a broad range of subjectsare internal WikiLeaks emails showing the
group debating strategy for attracting funds and supporters. The Cryptome
posts have provocative labels such as "wikileaks-fear," "wikileaks-snitch"
and "WL Hate."
In a July item titled "wikileaks-buck," Cryptome published an anonymous
letter from someone claiming to be a WikiLeaks insider, who complained
that WikiLeaks provides "absolutely no accounting" of funds it receives
and spends. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange disputes that claim, and says
all the alleged "insider" posts on Cryptome are fakes.
In an email, Mr. Assange called the "insider" posts on Cryptome
"fabricated from top to bottom." He declined to elaborate, or to comment
further on Cryptome.
Mr. Young said he receives some documents anonymously, through an
encrypted submission system. Asked whether some might be fake, Mr. Young
said he was "agnostic on issues of fakeness."
"There's no way to tell the difference between a real one and a fake in
general," Mr. Young said. "So let people decide for themselves."
After WikiLeaks' weekend publication of 400,000 documents about the Iraq
war, Cryptome has been busy. In an Oct. 23 item, Mr. Young posted a
variety of barbs about WikiLeaks, including an accusation that it holds
"dramatic, rigged, press shindigs" to announce its leaks.
Cryptome isn't the only one watching the watchers. A cottage industry
based on scrutinizing WikiLeaks has sprung up in recent years.
Wikileak.orgsingular, no "s"opines on WikiLeaks' tactics and links to
articles about WikiLeaks. Wikileads.net offered "WikiLeaks buzz, news and
analysis" before petering out in 2008. Media blog Gawker also posts
information about Mr. Assange and company on the site wikileakileaks.org.
Mr. Young founded Cryptome in 1996 as one of the Web's first repositories
of leaked documents and top-secret information, publishing documents such
as lists of alleged British spies and the alleged site of former Vice
President Dick Cheney's famed "undisclosed location" following the Sept.
11, 2001, terror attacks on New York and Washington.
Like WikiLeaks founder Mr. Assange, Mr. Young crusades for full disclosure
but is stingy with details about his own life. He grew up in Texas but
won't say exactly where, and declines to give his age.
Mr. Young said he generates some material for Cryptome by filing Freedom
of Information requests about WikiLeaks. On Aug. 9, he posted on the site
a letter he said he sent to the Central Intelligence Agency "requesting
information or records on Wikileaks.org, Julian Assange and others unknown
associated with Wikileaks and its affiliates." The CIA couldn't
immediately confirm receipt of the FOIA request.
In the mid-1990s, Mr. Young said, he became acquainted with Mr. Assange
through the "cypherpunks" movement, which united programmers, hackers and
others interested in Internet privacy. The movement draws its name from
the word "cipher," which means, among other things, a system of writing in
secret code.
Mr. Young said in 2006 Mr. Assange asked him to become the public face of
WikiLeaks in the U.S., where he was supposed to register the wikileaks.org
domain in his name. But a few months later Mr. Young fell out with the
group, alleging that its goal of raising $5 million was excessive and that
such sums "could not be needed so soon except for suspect purposes."
Mr. Young sent a heated farewell message to a WikiLeaks Internet mailing
list: "Wikileaks is a fraud: F your cute hustle and disinformation
campaign against legitimate dissent. Same old s, working for the enemy,"
he wrote. Then he posted the messageand a stream of WikiLeaks insider
emailsto Cryptome as a leak.
It was the first of dozens of WikiLeaks items he has posted, their number
intensifying in recent months as WikiLeaks has attracted more attention.

The Legislation That Could Kill Internet Privacy for Good
By Conor Friedersdorf
The Atlantic, Aug 1 2011,
An overzealous bill that claims to be about stopping child pornography
turns every Web user into a person to monitor
Every right-thinking person abhors child pornography. To combat it,
legislators have brought through committee a poorly conceived, over-broad
Congressional bill, The Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers
Act of 2011. It is arguably the biggest threat to civil liberties now
under consideration in the United States. The potential victims: everyone
who uses the Internet.
The good news? It hasn't gone before the full House yet.
The bad news: it already made it through committee. And history shows that
in times of moral panic, overly broad legislation has a way of becoming
law. In fact, a particular moment comes to mind.
In the early 20th Century, a different moral panic gripped the United
States: a rural nation was rapidly moving to anonymous cities, sexual
mores were changing, and Americans became convinced that an epidemic of
white female slavery was sweeping the land. Thus a 1910 law that made it
illegal to transport any person across state lines for prostitution "or
for any other immoral purpose." Suddenly premarital sex and adultery had
been criminalized, as scam artists would quickly figure out. "Women would
lure male conventioneers across a state line, say from New York to
Atlantic City, New Jersey," David Langum* explains, "and then threaten to
expose them to the prosecutors for violation" unless paid off. Inveighing
against the law, the New York Times noted that, though it was officially
called the White Slave Traffic Act (aka The Mann Act), a more apt name
would've been "the Encouragement of Blackmail Act."
That name is what brought the anecdote back to me. A better name for the
child pornography bill would be The Encouragement of Blackmail by Law
Enforcement Act. At issue is how to catch child pornographers. It's too
hard now, say the bill's backers, and I can sympathize. It's their
solution that appalls me: under language approved 19 to 10 by a House
committee, the firm that sells you Internet access would be required to
track all of your Internet activity and save it for 18 months, along with
your name, the address where you live, your bank account numbers, your
credit card numbers, and IP addresses you've been assigned.
Tracking the private daily behavior of everyone in order to help catch a
small number of child criminals is itself the noxious practice of police
states. Said an attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation: "The data
retention mandate in this bill would treat every Internet user like a
criminal and threaten the online privacy and free speech rights of every
American." Even more troubling is what the government would need to do in
order to access this trove of private information: ask for it.
I kid you not -- that's it.
As written, The Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of
2011 doesn't require that someone be under investigation on child
pornography charges in order for police to access their Internet history

Foreign activists stay covered online
Mass group's software helps avoid censorship
A Walpole-based group of Internet activists known as Tor is playing a key
role in helping Egyptians get around Internet censorship during this
current political turmoil.
Over the last three days, 120,000 people - most of them Egyptian - have
downloaded Tor software, which helps activists protect their identity from
surveillance by repressive regimes and get around blocked sites, according
to Andrew Lewman, executive director of Tor, which provides the software
for free.
"We saw this huge amount of traffic,44 said Lewman, who said the group
normally gets about 20,000 downloads a day worldwide. "We started looking
at what was going on and the Internet service provider called us and said,
`You are getting a huge amount of requests from Egypt.4 It didn4t look
like an attack. It looked like a flash crowd.44
Most of the downloads occurred just before the Egyptian government ordered
a near-total block of the Internet on Thursday night, but usage remains
high through the few pathways to the Internet that remain.
It is not the first time that Tor, which was formed in 2001 after two MIT
students developed the anonymity software with a US Navy laboratory, has
found itself in the center of a political uprising.
Iranian activists downloaded its software en masse during the massive
protests after the contested 2009 presidential elections, and China has
repeatedly tried to block Tor downloads and denied visas to Tor4s
activists, who have trained people from over 20 countries, including
China, at workshops in Hong Kong and Europe.
"It is plain that tools like Tor can be enormously value,44 said John
Palfrey, co-director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at
Harvard University, who did a study of software that activists use,
including Tor. Since only the most tech-savvy know how to use such
software, "there is enormous value in trainings and they pay dividends in
crisis moments like this,44 he said.
The group, which employs about 10 people, runs a network of about 2,500
computers around the world manned by volunteers who help the anonymous
network run. It registered as a nonprofit in 2006 and receives about 75
percent of its funding from the US government.
About a year ago, Tor set up a special system just for Tunisian activists
to protect their identity. So when the Tunisian government began
monitoring Facebook pages and Twitter accounts during the recent uprising
in Tunisia, "those people were already protected,44 Lewman said.
In December 2009, Jacob Appelbaum, one of Tor4s main software developers,
traveled to Cairo and held workshops for human rights activists on how to
use the software to avoid surveillance on the Internet.
The workshop appears to have paid off. As protests swelled in Egypt in
recent days, so many people rushed to download Tor that one of its servers
crashed on Thursday. They managed to keep their service up and running,
but the downloads from Egypt plummeted Thursday night after the government
apparently ordered a near-total block on Internet service.
An estimated 91 percent of routes to the Internet in Egypt were down in a
matter of hours, according to Andree Toonk, the Dutch founder and lead
developer of BGPMon.net, which monitors the Internet and routing.
But a few paths to the Internet have remained, and those who use them are
continuing to use Tor, creating a spike in use despite the near-blackout
in online communication.
One Internet service provider, a company called Noor, was left unaffected
perhaps because it services banks or the Egyptian stock market, Toonk
said. That means that it is probably being closely scrutinized by the
Egyptian intelligence service, making anonymity software all the more
crucial, Tor activists said.
"People in Egypt right now that are using the Internet really need to
cover their tracks,44 said Appelbaum by telephone from Seattle. "Let4s
pretend that the government doesn4t fall. . . . We don4t know if they have
analysts working in real time to try to find activists, and we are trying
to make sure that people have access to Tor, so that people aren4t hunted
down in the streets.44
Appelbaum, who also works with WikiLeaks, suggested that the Internet
activists in Egypt who are using Tor to conceal their identities are not
merely organizing meetings in the streets, but may also be engaging in
on-line resistance activities, such as disrupting the Egyptian stock
market or banking activities.
"One of the ways to hit the Egyptian government where it hurts . . . is to
target the stock exchange, knock it off line or disrupt its activities, as
a method of protest,44 he said.
He said he is not involved in such activities, but that he witnessed
online discussions among Egyptian activists talking about taking such
Appelbaum is also part of a separate group of activists that is trying to
establish a satellite link to Egypt.
Steven A. Cook, a specialist on democracy movements in the Middle East who
just returned from Cairo, said that the Egyptian government4s
unprecedented attempt to shut off the Internet had done little to quell
the protests.
"Shutting off the Internet has done nothing to prevent the world from
seeing what is going on,44 he said. "It didn4t matter anymore because
people were coming out into the streets regardless.44

Counter-terrorism tools used to spot fraud
By Richard Waters in London (Dec 13, 2012)
JPMorgan Chase has turned to technology used for countering terrorism to
spot fraud risk among its own employees and to tackle problems such as
deciding how much to charge when selling property behind troubled
The technology involves crunching vast amounts of data to identify
hard-to-detect patterns in markets or individual behaviour that could
reveal risks or openings to make money. Other banks are also turning to
bbig datab, the name given to using large bodies of information, to
identify potential rogue traders who might land them with massive losses,
according to experts in the field.
bTheybre trying to mine not just trading data, but also emails [and] phone
calls,b said David Wallace, an executive at SAS, a US data analysis
company. bTheybre trying to find the needle in the haystack.b
Guy Chiarello, JPMorganbs chief information officer, said the bank was
mining massive bodies of data in ba couple of dozen projectsb that
promised to have a significant effect on its business, although he refused
to give further details.
According to three people familiar with its activities, JPMorgan has used
Palantir Technologies, a Silicon Valley company whose technology was honed
while working for the US intelligence services, for part of its effort. It
first used the technology to spot fraudsters trying to hack into client
accounts or ATMs, but has recently started to turn it on its own
250,000-strong staff.
In another aspect of its big data work, the bank is drawing on large
amounts of highly diverse information about local economies where it has
troubled real estate loans, two of these people said. The information is
being used to set prices for property sold before a loan goes into
default, in an attempt to reduce the social disruption caused by the
troubled loans.
Other technology companies are also finding new purposes for
number-crunching techniques used in intelligence to bring new
data-intensive approaches to risk management, credit assessment and
marketing activities. Quantifind, a tech start-up that has worked with the
CIA to identify aliases used by terrorists, was called in by JPMorgan to
explain how its technology could be applied to its credit card business,
said Ari Tuchman, chief executive.
Some of the same technologies revolutionising risk-management in banks,
meanwhile, are being used to break down barriers in the financial services
business and let start-ups compete head-on with large institutions.
Larry Summers, former US Treasury secretary, predicted that this would
lead to a wave of new technology-based companies in the consumer lending
and investment fields.
bWebve had a generation where financial innovation was found in large
institutions for the benefit of large pools of capital,b he told the FT.
bI think the next generation of innovation will be more for consumers.b
Mr Summers on Thursday joined the board of Lending Club, a Silicon Valley
start-up that lets individuals invest directly in pools of consumer loans
it generates over the internet. The company has been able to take a large
slice out of the funding and operating costs of a traditional bank and
offer better terms to borrowers and lenders, said RenaudLaPlanche, Lending
Clubbs chief executive.

Minister: Iceland refused to help FBI on WikiLeaks
Posted Friday, Feb. 01, 2013.
By RAPHAEL SATTER
(Associated Press)
LONDON ? Iceland's interior minister said Friday that he ordered the
country's police not to cooperate with FBI agents sent to investigate
WikiLeaks two years ago, offering a rare glimpse into the U.S. Department
of Justice's investigation of the secret-busting site.
Ogmundur Jonasson told The Associated Press that he was upset when he
found out that FBI agents had flown to the country to interview an
unidentified WikiLeaks associate in August 2011.
"I, for one, was not aware that they were coming to Iceland," he said in a
brief telephone interview. "When I learned about it, I demanded that
Icelandic police cease all cooperation and made it clear that people
interviewed or interrogated in Iceland should be interrogated by Icelandic
Jonasson said that Icelandic diplomats protested the FBI's trip to their
U.S. counterparts.
"We made clear to the American authorities that this was not well-seen by
us," he said.
The exact purpose of the FBI's trip to Iceland isn't clear - the U.S.
Embassy in Reykjavik referred questions to the FBI, and the bureau did not
immediately return an email seeking comment - but the tiny north Atlantic
nation has been a key hub for WikiLeaks and its supporters.
In 2010 WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange helped craft Iceland's
journalist-friendly media law, and WikiLeaks payment processor, DataCell,
is based in Reykjavik. Several key allies, including lawmaker Birgitta
Jonsdottir and WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson, are also from the
country. Hrafnsson said in a telephone interview that he believed the
target of the FBI's trip might have been a former WikiLeaks volunteer,
whom he declined to name.
Regardless of what the target was, the minister's account of the FBI's
trip opens a window into a sensitive inquiry which has so far remained
largely under wraps. The U.S. Department of Justice has been investigating
WikiLeaks since it began pouring classified U.S. documents into the public
domain, but officials have refused to reveal almost any information about
the size, scope, or nature of their inquiry, citing national security
