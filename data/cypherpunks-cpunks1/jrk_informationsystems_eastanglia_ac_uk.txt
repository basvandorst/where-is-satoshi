I have seen mentioned in sci.electronics (not recently) that true random
number generator chips are available off-the-shelf.  Texas Instruments was
mentioned as one source, but I don't remember details.

Pardon a perhaps clueless question from a foreigner, but how much control
does the US president actually have over a potential bunch of zealous
authoritarians elsewhere in the administration, especially in super-secret
places like the NSA?  How much control is it even possible for one person
to hold?

How do you know that these numbers aren't already in use as a code system,
under the control of someone who may not have your interests at heart? Mafia numbers indeed!

It would seem in keeping with the spirit of alt.whistleblowers for the
newgroup to be performed anonymously.  Does anon.penet.fi support the
control newsgroup? :-)  More seriously, why doesn't everyone who knows how
and wants the group created simply forge an anonymous creation message?
