Is it just me, or does this come up every few months?
They are already there - in elm and pine, as well as many others.
No need to kludge anything.  Take a good look at the PGP docs - they will
let you do exactly what you want.
I'm running Linux here, and have run it both as static/dynamic SLIP, and hung
(well!) off a T1 line.
This last one is really the only advantage to running cfs, IMO.
Here's the set of scripts I use here.  Others use more sophisticated ones, but
I'm not into shell programming ;}
pgpview will decrypt to the screen, vie will edit then encrypt, vis will edit
then sign.  They are intended to be used from within elm.

# 2. Save the resulting text in a file.
# 3. Execute the file with /bin/sh to create:

@_subject: crypto for porno users 
Very true.  Authentication, whether strong or weak, merely says that you are who you say you are -
totally different from this "web of trust" I keep hearing about - and that is *it*.  Do you trust me
any more now than before I started signing my postings? It's well-known that most revelations of encrypted information come from "humint", not from mathematical finesse with the encryption scheme.  I especially love Oracle's idea of security - when submitting SQL to the Oracle back-end, to automate the process, you feed it your user ID and password IN THE CLEAR, ON THE COMMAND LINE.  Any weenie can run "ps -ef/ps -ax" and pipe it to grep.  The fact that Larry Ellison wont do anything about it seems to me to be idiocy of the first order, and that Oracle doesn't know what it's doing.  It's not even a good database product.  Deity only knows why people keep buying it, although that's rather off-topic ;)

@_subject: Netscape flaw hits the big time 
Just heard on the CBS hourly radio news that Netscape will release a new version on Wednesday correcting a flaw that would "allow hackers access credit card numbers."
As usual, they got it all wrong, but what do you expect?

@_subject: "random" number seeds vs. Netscape 
I tested for randomness by looking at the distribution of random numbers over the range I was drawing random numbers from.  If it didn't look random, it wasn't ;)
