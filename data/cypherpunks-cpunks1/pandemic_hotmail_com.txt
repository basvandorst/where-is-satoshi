@_subject: Distributed data havens? 
Is anything new on the distributed data haven front? Many apologies if
I'm retreading scorched earth, but I've been out of touch with the world
for the past, oh, twelve weeks. In particular, it would be interesting
to know if
* there are any lists currently extant relating to datahavens (I've
changed e-mail addresses and can't recall the subscription address for
* anyone has created working or in-progress code to play with. Doesn't
have to be "distributed", supported, or documented particularly well. * there are archives of relevant papers or talks avaliable. I've found a
few archives for cryptography and stego, but nothing specific just yet
(unless you count the discussions of anon remailers). Anyone still interested? "Deities do not fall ten floors to the basement" - Willis/PKD

that I accept its terms and conditions.
What I write in snail mail, however, may also be used in a court of law
to show that I actually thought or wrote whatever it was I wrote. Why
would e-mail be any different? That's the rub about nailing down identity...there's no such thing as
plausible deniability anymore.
In a court of law, assuming you could prove to a judge and jury that
digi sigs establish identity beyond a reasonable doubt, I'd imagine
that  anything signed, law or no law, would be legally binding insofar
as you actually wrote it.
I think I'm missing something...?
