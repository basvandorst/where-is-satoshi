No, the "-------- Forwarded Message Follows ------" line is before the PGP

Subj: GoodBye PublicData.com
Dear Friends, It is with mixed emotions that I bring you news as to the future of
PublicData.com.  First let me tell you that we appreciate all of the
letters of support that you have sent.  During the many days of
confusion, your kind letters help us to remain focused on the tasks at
hand. Our company ShadowSoft, Inc. publishes Public Records CDs and we
specialize in consulting or contracting with databases (preferably
large databases).  ShadowSoft was approached around the end on 1996
and was asked if we could place our public records databases on the
Internet.  After a little bit of tinkering the basic model that you
see at PublicData.com was developed. ShadowSoft is staffed with the best technical people in the  industry but we don't have skills in the area of marketing. It has been our desire all along to simply be the technical and database contractor for someone who wished to run the business  of marketing and merchandising PublicData.com.  A law passed by the Texas legislature this year banning the distribution of public
data records over the Internet has made finding a merchandiser
difficult and has made us re-think our position.  I have made the
decision that ShadowSoft shall cease operating PublicData.com on
August 31, 1997. Because of my own personal belief that keeping public records  available to the public in a free society is critical and essential to
keeping our country free, ShadowSoft has sold PublicData.com to a
company based in Anguilla, British West Indies.  The company which is
named PublicData.com.ai Ltd. has purchased all of the programs that
ShadowSoft developed which gives you access to the information over
the Internet.  In addition, ShadowSoft will  consult for
PublicData.com but our data was not sold to them  as a part of our
deal.  Instead, PublicData.com has purchased another copy of the same
databases and should be able to provide uninterrupted service to you
after September 1, 1997. The new owners of PublicData.com should be sending you a note very soon.  Thanks again for all of your support and please consider keeping a subscription with PublicData.com. Sincerely, Bruce President ShadowSoft, Inc.

@_subject: Netscape Crypto 
Netscape3 export version usually uses RC4 with a 40 bit shared key.
Key sizes are not a very meaningful indicator of security, which is a
holistic thing.
I think that security in that respect probably has much more to do with
the security of the server which receives your information, than with the
cypher used in transit.  Assure yourself that the person you send the
information to is trustworthy and knows how to secure a computer system. Even weak HTTPS encryption will make it somewhat difficult for people to
grab your information out of a proxy cache or log and similar trivial
Compared to what?  More secure than unencrypted, less secure than
strongly-encrypted. More secure than Internet Explorer, less secure than
Lynx.  Probably.
You'll probably only lose the $50 credit-card excess at most: I'd trust
that to Netscape, if I was sending it to a reputable party.  There's
plenty of information I wouldn't trust to it.
Doubled punctuation is too bad.

 * (now, with legal B.S. out of the way.....)  *  * This routine gathers environmental noise from device drivers, etc.,
 * and returns good random numbers, suitable for cryptographic use.
 * Besides the obvious cryptographic uses, these numbers are also good
 * for seeding TCP sequence numbers, and other places where it is
 * desirable to have numbers which are not only random, but hard to
 * predict by an attacker.
 *
 * Theory of operation
 * ===================
 *  * Computers are very predictable devices.  Hence it is extremely hard
 * to produce truly random numbers on a computer --- as opposed to
 * pseudo-random numbers, which can easily generated by using a
 * algorithm.  Unfortunately, it is very easy for attackers to guess
 * the sequence of pseudo-random number generators, and for some
 * applications this is not acceptable.  So instead, we must try to
 * gather "environmental noise" from the computer's environment, which
 * must be hard for outside attackers to observe, and use that to
 * generate random numbers.  In a Unix environment, this is best done
 * from inside the kernel.
 *  * Sources of randomness from the environment include inter-keyboard
 * timings, inter-interrupt timings from some interrupts, and other
 * events which are both (a) non-deterministic and (b) hard for an
 * outside observer to measure.  Randomness from these sources are
 * added to an "entropy pool", which is mixed using a CRC-like function.
 * This is not cryptographically strong, but it is adequate assuming
 * the randomness is not chosen maliciously, and it is fast enough that
 * the overhead of doing it on every interrupt is very reasonable.
 * As random bytes are mixed into the entropy pool, the routines keep
 * an *estimate* of how many bits of randomness have been stored into
 * the random number generator's internal state.
 *  * When random bytes are desired, they are obtained by taking the MD5
 * hash of the contents of the "entropy pool".  The MD5 hash avoids
 * exposing the internal state of the entropy pool.  It is believed to
 * be computationally infeasible to derive any useful information
 * about the input of MD5 from its output.  Even if it is possible to
 * analyze MD5 in some clever way, as long as the amount of data
 * returned from the generator is less than the inherent entropy in
 * the pool, the output data is totally unpredictable.  For this
 * reason, the routine decreases its internal estimate of how many
 * bits of "true randomness" are contained in the entropy pool as it
 * outputs random numbers.
 *  * If this estimate goes to zero, the routine can still generate
 * random numbers; however, an attacker may (at least in theory) be
 * able to infer the future output of the generator from prior
 * outputs.  This requires successful cryptanalysis of MD5, which is
 * not believed to be feasible, but there is a remote possibility.
 * Nonetheless, these numbers should be useful for the vast majority
 * of purposes.
 *  * Exported interfaces ---- output
 * ===============================
 *  * There are three exported interfaces; the first is one designed to
 * be used from within the kernel:
 *
 * 	void get_random_bytes(void *buf, int nbytes);
 *
 * This interface will return the requested number of random bytes,
 * and place it in the requested buffer.
 *  * The two other interfaces are two character devices /dev/random and
 * /dev/urandom.  /dev/random is suitable for use when very high
 * quality randomness is desired (for example, for key generation or
 * one-time pads), as it will only return a maximum of the number of
 * bits of randomness (as estimated by the random number generator)
 * contained in the entropy pool.
 *  * The /dev/urandom device does not have this limit, and will return
 * as many bytes as are requested.  As more and more random bytes are
 * requested without giving time for the entropy pool to recharge,
 * this will result in random numbers that are merely cryptographically
 * strong.  For many applications, however, this is acceptable.
 *
 * Exported interfaces ---- input
 * ==============================
 *  * The current exported interfaces for gathering environmental noise
 * from the devices are:
 *  * 	void add_keyboard_randomness(unsigned char scancode);
 * 	void add_mouse_randomness(__u32 mouse_data);
 * 	void add_interrupt_randomness(int irq);
 * 	void add_blkdev_randomness(int irq);
 *  * add_keyboard_randomness() uses the inter-keypress timing, as well as the
 * scancode as random inputs into the "entropy pool".
 *  * add_mouse_randomness() uses the mouse interrupt timing, as well as
 * the reported position of the mouse from the hardware.
 *
 * add_interrupt_randomness() uses the inter-interrupt timing as random
 * inputs to the entropy pool.  Note that not all interrupts are good
 * sources of randomness!  For example, the timer interrupts is not a
 * good choice, because the periodicity of the interrupts is to
 * regular, and hence predictable to an attacker.  Disk interrupts are
 * a better measure, since the timing of the disk interrupts are more
 * unpredictable.
 *  * add_blkdev_randomness() times the finishing time of block requests.
 *  * All of these routines try to estimate how many bits of randomness a
 * particular randomness source.  They do this by keeping track of the
 * first and second order deltas of the event timings.
 *
 * Ensuring unpredictability at system startup
 * ============================================
 *  * When any operating system starts up, it will go through a sequence
 * of actions that are fairly predictable by an adversary, especially
 * if the start-up does not involve interaction with a human operator.
 * This reduces the actual number of bits of unpredictability in the
 * entropy pool below the value in entropy_count.  In order to
 * counteract this effect, it helps to carry information in the
 * entropy pool across shut-downs and start-ups.  To do this, put the
 * following lines an appropriate script which is run during the boot
 * sequence:  *
 *	echo "Initializing random number generator..."
 *	# Carry a random seed from start-up to start-up
 *	# Load and then save 512 bytes, which is the size of the entropy pool
 * 	if [ -f /etc/random-seed ]; then
 *		cat /etc/random-seed >/dev/urandom
 * 	fi
 *	dd if=/dev/urandom of=/etc/random-seed count=1
 *
 * and the following lines in an appropriate script which is run as
 * the system is shutdown:
 *  *	# Carry a random seed from shut-down to start-up
 *	# Save 512 bytes, which is the size of the entropy pool
 *	echo "Saving random seed..."
 *	dd if=/dev/urandom of=/etc/random-seed count=1
 *  * For example, on many Linux systems, the appropriate scripts are
 * usually /etc/rc.d/rc.local and /etc/rc.d/rc.0, respectively.
 *  * Effectively, these commands cause the contents of the entropy pool
 * to be saved at shut-down time and reloaded into the entropy pool at
 * start-up.  (The 'dd' in the addition to the bootup script is to
 * make sure that /etc/random-seed is different for every start-up,
 * even if the system crashes without executing rc.0.)  Even with
 * complete knowledge of the start-up activities, predicting the state
 * of the entropy pool requires knowledge of the previous history of
 * the system.
 *
 * Configuring the /dev/random driver under Linux
 * ==============================================
 *
 * The /dev/random driver under Linux uses minor numbers 8 and 9 of
 * the /dev/mem major number (  So if your system does not have
 * /dev/random and /dev/urandom created already, they can be created
 * by using the commands:
 *
 * 	mknod /dev/random c 1 8
 * 	mknod /dev/urandom c 1 9
 *  * Acknowledgements:
 * =================
 *
 * Ideas for constructing this random number generator were derived
 * from the Pretty Good Privacy's random number generator, and from
 * private discussions with Phil Karn.  Colin Plumb provided a faster
 * random number generator, which speed up the mixing function of the
 * entropy pool, taken from PGP 3.0 (under development).  It has since
 * been modified by myself to provide better mixing in the case where
 * the input values to add_entropy_word() are mostly small numbers.
 * Dale Worley has also contributed many useful ideas and suggestions
 * to improve this driver.
 *  * Any flaws in the design are solely my responsibility, and should
 * not be attributed to the Phil, Colin, or any of authors of PGP.
 *  * The code for MD5 transform was taken from Colin Plumb's
 * implementation, which has been placed in the public domain.  The
 * MD5 cryptographic checksum was devised by Ronald Rivest, and is
 * documented in RFC 1321, "The MD5 Message Digest Algorithm".
 *  * Further background information on this topic may be obtained from
 * RFC 1750, "Randomness Recommendations for Security", by Donald
 * Eastlake, Steve Crocker, and Jeff Schiller.

For what it's worth, we use Stronghold and are very happy with it.
They ship almost all the code, and they provide worthwhile crypto
outside of the States.  Being based on Apache it has a fairly vibrant
development community, so you can obtain modules to do Java servlets,
inline Perl, access to various DBs, and so on, and participate in the
development of those modules.  It's moderately easy to install,
configure, and customize, although you'd probably want a little bit of
Unix sysadmin experience.  I believe an NT port is in alpha.
Criticism?  A few times I've run into SIGSEGV's in the crypto
libraries.  To be fair, the problems are only visible when you plug in
third-party modules, there are workarounds, and they may in fact be
not Stronghold's fault.  Also, their manual seems to have been out of
print for months -- not such a problem because there's an online
version, but still a bit annoying.
UKWeb's technical support are quite good and compare extremely well to
that of some large organizations.
I have no evidence in support or rebuttal of C2Net's alleged
harrassment of Dr Vulis, so I won't comment on that.

There's a huge difference between people talking about fucking little
boys, and people actually doing it.  The latter is certainly rape, and
perpetrators should certainly be jailed at the very least.  However, for
all that it may be offensive, data doesn't hurt children, except in that
it records previous crimes, or foreshadows future ones.  Even if we were to admit some of this information constitutes a thought
crime there's still no shortage of far more important physical crimes
against children for our protectors to deal with. Read some de Sade from your local library.  For many liberal people, it

@_subject: cryptographic anecdotes -- GPS and 
Do you know the timeslot yet?
"Java Network Services" (I forget the exact title) from Prentice Hall has
a case study about interfacing Java to GPS hardware.  The introduction to
the chapter provides some very interesting information about GPS which,
like crypto, is a "dual use technology".  It's not exactly the same, of
course -- GPS is about people getting information that the state would
like to keep secret, not vice versa -- but it's still interesting.
("Location escrow" is a nice phrase.)
If the book is correct, then the system was originally designed to
introduce errors into the part of the time signal decypherable by civilian
users that would produce positional uncertainty of about 100m.  The
complete signal, available (in theory) only to US or US-sponsored forces,
allowed positions to be calculated to within an accuracy of about 1m.
However, hackers being what they are ;-), somebody realized that since the
same errors were observed by all receivers, one could compensate for them
to some extent.  Specifically, one has a base station somewhere whose location you know
very accurately by other means.  This station continuously subtracts it's
known position from the position calculated by it's civilian GPS hardware,
and broadcasts the difference over the pager network or some other public
medium.  (The math is not quite that simple, I imagine, but conceptually
that's what you do.)  Combining this information with the satellite signals
allows civilian GPS hardware to improve it's accuracy by an order of
magnitude to about 10m of uncertainty, which could make all the difference
in, say, a search-and-rescue situation.  This technique is called,
obviously enough, "differential GPS". Even more interesting is that the DOT is apparently negotiating with the
DOD to make full GPS publicly available, presumably because it would sell
more cars.  (Just what the world needs...)  Quite possibly there will be
export restrictions, of course.  The similarities to commerce vs TLA
concerns in encryption are obvious.  I don't know the outcome of the
negotiations, but I got the impression it was more likely than not. The book was not immensely technical, so some (or all) details may be
Assuming you're talking about Australian RN, then comparisons to the
