@_subject: Jim Bell Justified??? 
During my PreTrial InFarceRation, at a time when the Federal GovernMint was attempting to pressure me into giving up my right to an extradition hearing, Linda Lou informed me that Jeff Gordon had asked her to tell me that if I waived extradition, that I would be able to get proper medical treatment once I was extradited to Washington.
This, of course, turned out to be a BaldFacedLie, but regardless, one has to ask oneself what kind of LowLifeBottomSuckingScum would attempt to pressure a citizen into giving up one's legal rights by suggesting that relief from medical torture and abuse is conditional upon making one's prosecution, and unavoidable conviction, easier for the GooberMint.
There is a reason that the Feds object to the Citizens paying too close a scrutiny to them personally.  It is because Federal Employees who use their positions to ShitOnTheConstitution and commit Ethical Atrocities understandably live in Fear of the Citizens.
Jim Bell's prosecution did not reflect his danger to anybody, but his danger to the Fears of the Justice Criminals who recognize that, according to the Values&OR&Ethics of the Founding Fathers, THEY [TM] would be Targets...
In Reality, THEY [TM] Prosecute Only ThemSelves...

@_subject: Let's Attack The Irish White Christian Terroroists... 
Of course we're not attacking a Religion or a Country's 'people'...
So let's prove it by launching Air Strikes against the Irish Republican Army Terrorists and the Irish Government entities that give them aid and support.  Lets launch Air Strikes against the homes and families of the SeanPennSeanFeind Irish Politicians who support terroroism.
I'm certain that there are plenty of Arab/Islamic nations that would be more than happy to join in a ColdItion to launch Murderous Military Strikes against White Christian Terrorists and the governments and political parties which support them...and if not...then we could Pressure them into supporting it, using threats of embargos and financial sanctions.
I'm not really up on current events.  I've spent a lot of time during the last three years being chained in my own shit and piss by the American Justice System as Puni$hMint for being DisAbled, so I am wondering if there are any other WhiteChristianTerrorists and U.S.-Allies that need to be Attacked and Murdered in order to emphasize to the World that we are not just using our MilitaryMight to fuck with Islamic SandNiggers and their UnApproved Governments (that we used to support and probably put in power in the first place, but now that they no longer serve our purposes, we intend to Murder&OR&Depose them...)
While we're at it, let's launch an AirStrike against TheSingleInnocentChild [TM] that U.S. politicians use as an excuse to take away all of our Civil Liberties...

        Why France lived in fear of 'Londonistan'
        By Sean O'Neill
        Terrorist recruitment and fundraising by Islamic militants centred
on a London mosque were ignored for years by the British security services,
a former Special Branch informant claimed yesterday.
Naturally, the British security services will be using the current
climate of terror to cry out for even more intrusive powers to
spy on goDog&EveryBody, in order to gather an even larger
database of information to ignore until it is too late...

@_subject: Muslims and Christians Stand United 
We can't think about the deaths at the WTC in NYC without also thinking about the murder of Muslims in Pakistan   Our prayers for the mercy of Allah and his blessings should be upon them, along with our prayers for the mercy of God and his blessings on New York's Christian victims.    We received with great sorrow the news of the murder of some of the Muslim brothers in Karachi while they were expressing their opposition to the American crusade forces and their allies on the lands of Muslims in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Will Allah accept them as martyrs and include them with prophets, their followers, martyrs, good doers and the like and ask that their families be gifted with patience and consolation, and bless their children and money, and reward well for their Islam, just as we expect God to do for the Christians in New York City?   Whoever of them left children behind, they are our children, and we are their caretakers, God and Allah willing.   It is no wonder that the Muslim nation in Pakistan would rush to defend its Islam, since it is considered the first line of defense for Islam in this area, just like Afghanistan was the first line of defense for itself and for Pakistan before the Russian invasion more than 20 years ago, and like Christianity was the main line of America's defense against GodLess Communism during the Cold War.   These brothers are considered among Muslims to be among the first martyrs in Islam's battle in this era against the new Christian-Jewish crusade led by the big crusader Bush under the flag of the Cross, just as the dead WTC and 747 Christian Americans are considered to be martyrs and heros as targets of the crusade led by Muslim-Arabian crusader Bin Laden.   The Arabs will undoubtedly incite their Muslim brothers in Pakistan to give everything they own and are capable of to push the American crusade forces from invading Pakistan and Afghanistan. just as Americans are wholeheartedly behind their Christian Avengers readying to do the Retributive Invading. The Prophet, Peace Be Upon Him, said: Whoever didn't fight, or prepare a fighter, or take good care of a fighter's family, Allah will strike him with a catastrophe before Judgment Day. And God Almighty, an Exactly Equal Amount Of Peace Be Upon Him, as well, used a GoodPortion of His GoodBook to Sing the Praises of His PreChristian Jewish Soldiers for using the JawBones of Asses to Kick the Asses of the NonChosen, and putting His DesertWandering Curse upon them if they fell short of dispensing his Vengance upon the Heathens.   Osma Been Bomb'in has announced to his beloved Muslims brothers that they are steadfast on the path of Jihad for the sake of Allah, following the example of the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him), with the heroic, faithful Afghan people, under the leadership of our fighter emir, who is proud of his religion, the prince of the faithful, Mullah Mohammed Omar. Uncle Sam has announced to the Sacred Defenders of the U.S. version of freedom, following the example of the Christian Prince of Peace [the version with the DoubleEdged Sword...], with the heroic, faithful American people, under the leadership of our fighter president, who is proud of Billy Graham's religion...   The Muslims ask Allah to make them victorious over the forces of infidels and tyranny, and to crush the new Christian-Jewish crusade on the land of Pakistan and Afghanistan, while the Christians ask God to make them victorious over the forces of fanatics and terrorism, and to crush the Muslim-Arab crusade on the land of Palestine and Israel.   If Allah makes you victorious, none will defeat you and if He fails you, who after Him will make you victorious and on Allah the faithful shall trust...   If Jehovah makes you victorious, none will defeat you and if He fails you, who after Him will make you victorious and on Jehovah the faithful shall trust...   Your brothers in Islam and Christianity,   Osama bin Mohammed bin Laden   and   Ahma gonna'be Bomb'in bin Laden

Micro$not, hoping that QuadRuple/NoScruple Felons who have been Convicted of sending !!!DEATH THREATS!!! to ABillionaire2BeNamedLater might be diverted from their past fixations by being provided with *Fresh Victims*, have included Spying&OR&Stalking Features in their OutLook eMail SnoopWare.
ForNoApparentReason, I seem to be getting Return Receipts from my eMail messages, INFORMing me who is reading the messages I send, who is deleting them, and RoadMaps to their Homes and WorkPlaces...
(OK, I just made the last part up, eh?)
Thus I am INFORMed,
Your message

  Sent:    Wed, 26 Sep 2001 07:01:01 -0400
was read on Wed, 26 Sep 2001 08:47:37 -0400
and now know who I can contact for help and support the next time that I am forced into hiding for engaging in criminal activity.
I have also been INFORMed,

so that if Osma bin Laden inquires as to whether or not I know of any individuals who are not showing proper concern for the issues that are important to him, I now have some names to provide to him.
I was also INFORMed,
This is a Return Receipt for the mail that you sent to
bwphilli at cisco.com.
piolenc at mozcom.com.
Note: this Return Receipt only acknowledges that the message was
displayed on the recipient's machine. There is no guarantee that the
content has been read or understood.
so that if they ever GetInMyFace, I can reply, "Hey! You're so FuckingSTUPID that your own computer doubts whether you can even read, or understand diddly, even if you can read..."
And an AutoResponse Return Receipt INFORMs me,
Will return on 10/11.  Check with Kevin Deeley if you need an immediate response
so that if I suddenly get the Irresistable Urge to [Imaging *Your* WorstNighMare Here], I know that I will either have to wait for Martin's return date, or [I*Y*WNH] Kevin...
OfCourseOfCourse [TM], this SpyStalk Feature of Micro$not'S eMail product will provide PerseProseCuting Attorneys with ValuableEvidence in Court Cases where RealEvidence is lacking, but this is of little import in light of the fact that CyberStalking Laws will no doubt soon be in place that make sending or receiving email a Federal Crime.
(Don't worry, I'm sure they'll only prosecute the *BAD* guys, eh?)
