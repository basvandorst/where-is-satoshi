How do I know PGP IS secure? I don't. That doesn't mean I don't use it or don't trust it. PGP was designed and written by a human, who by it's nature
is NOT infallable. The name says it all.... PRETTY GOOD; not REALLY GREAT or UNCRACKABLE, just pretty good. I think the simple fact that I am not in jail (Knock on wood....) attests to the fact that the algorythm, RNG, works Pretty Good. (There's them there words again)

This Foster (And other conspiracy) BS is totally boring and old. I joined this list to learn from people how to use PGP and other crypto. I would just LOVE to learn how to setup PGP on WIN NT and WIN `95 for all my buddies so we can work towards MASS DEPLOYMENT. ANYONE who wants to talk about THAT can e-mail me at:
 ericande at linknet.kitsap.lib.wa.us
O.K. I'll admit that conspiracies ARE fun party talk, but jeez! people, it is getting MORE than a little stale.
P.S. Why don't we just quit monkeying around W/ this "Export PGP 3 lines at a time" stuff?  Just do what I do: Get  a fakename acct. @ your local library, UUencode the PGP.ZIP file and send it to ANYONE with a foreign net.tag at random. I've been doing this for about 6 weeks now and I've probably gotten 5 or 6 hundred copies out by now.

I wouldn't register my keys and I don't think ANY of us should either.
If they threatened me W/ RICO, I would probably register *A* key but certainly not one I EVER indended to actually use.
In a case like this I think massive civil disobediance would be a good I would like to see a campaign of sending PGP to random Euros or whoever has a foriegn tag through anon. remailers.Like this UU encode it and daisy
chain it to whoever.
How's that sound?

@_subject: write some code 
Sorry to revive such an old and tired thread, however I found the idea quite inspiring and went out and bought a C programming primer that comes W/
a complete tutorial and Borland's turbo C++ Lite compiler.
You people have had a *VERY* profound impact on me and that is what set me on this course. I have just written my first program; the mandatory
"Hello world" bit.
Can someone point me in the direction of a mailing list about C programming?
I have been reading the various comp. newsgroups, but I want to join a list on the subj. and make some more friends.
