In Italy, a law (well, not exactly, a decree by the telecommunication
authority, AGCOM) about an IP blacklist for file sharing websites is
being discussed. A final decision was supposed to be made in July, but
was finally delayed, probably till next November. Some links in English
that discuss it:
Because of this, many links and short guides to Tor are being posted
around, mostly by inexperienced users that do not warn about the
potential security problems, and are in generally quite misleading as to
what Tor actually is and how it works. In this context, the idea that an
unofficial, and apparently badly built Tor bundle might be out there
only makes sense.
