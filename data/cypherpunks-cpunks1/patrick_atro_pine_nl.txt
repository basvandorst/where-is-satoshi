Is this what the cypherpunks list has become ? Discussions about religion ?
If so, I am out of here...

Yeah right,
I subscribed to this list again after I met some cypherpunks
at HIP'97, as they told me it's still interesting.
AFAIK this list is about cryptography, privacy and security.
But hey, I just killfile everyone that discusses religion :)

I wrote two remailer programs, I ran several remailers, and I am working
on bugfixes for replay. I couldn't care less about your founding
fathers who killed the native americans and raped their women.
Killing virtually unarmed  people with guns is an act of cowardice.
Flaming me through a remailer is the equivalent of shouting 'hey asshole!' and then running away. Children do it often.
I also cannot reply to you privately, so all other members of
this mailinglist have to suffer our private flamewar.

Patrick Oonk stuttered and drooled:
  Did you shut down those "several remailers" out of...cowardice?
  Sorry to hear you have such a low opinion of those who use
anonymous remailers. Is your work on remailers an 'ego' thing,
or are you a cop?
  You want to "hide behind" private email? Ashamed of your beliefs
and don't want them made public?
  When did this become a "private" flamewar, shit-for-brains? Are
you under the mistaken impression that your public post to this
list has drawn negative replies from only a single anonymous
  My heart, also, bleeds purple piss for the poor, fragile young
cypherpunks who will suffer needlessly, perhaps being traumatized
for life, by exposure to negative energy and obscene words like
"dumbass." However, some of the older, more experienced members
of the cypherpunks list have long ago learned to make the best
of a bad situation, and amuse themselves by using their dick to
press the  key.
  So spam me, big boy. Spam me.

You can't read, obviously. What I said was that it's a bit lame to flame me
and call me names, without giving me  the oppportunity to mail you directly, w/o bothering the other people on this list.
You twist my words around.
By the way, where did your wig-wearing faggot founding fathers of you suddenly go ?
Start coding, instead of just flaming people.
Post-natal abortion would have been a good solution for you.

I am a cop, but it boosts my ego too.
Definitively. I am full of shit.
I am pretty sure there is only one person as sad as you are.
(Except me of course).
Let the pros stick to that.

Maybe for the simple reason that some people might not have the money to
defend themselves ?

I am glad I live in the Netherlands, where there's at least of bit
of social consciousness left.

Well, the program didn't work at all (at least here, Sun Solaris 2.5.1 Sparc, Perl 5.003) and now
it does. Before it only connected to one of the numbers
in the hosts file, now it does to all of them.
One problem left is that it only works with ip-numbers,
as it does not resolve them. I might fix this too.

There were several problems. One of it still remains, it does not resolve FDQN's, so you have to use IP-numbers in
the hosts file.
