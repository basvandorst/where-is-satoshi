What interests me the most about this (and similar proposals) is who will
be signing up to test this baby on their own computers.  Oh well, I guess
that's what employer's hardware is for :-)

The real question is, what attorney jokes do *you* know?  Do you tell
programmer jokes?

@_subject: Macintosh System 7 Pro, e-mail, encryption 
I installed Macintosh System 7 Pro (7.1.1) onto my PowerBook today.  I'd
heard that e-mail was part of the new package, but I was amazed to see how
integral it is.  When you start up for the first time you are asked for a
userid and a password to protect your "PowerTalk Keychain".
A mailbox and a "catalog" appear on your desktop; the latter is a list of
entries in different domains (like AppleTalk, EtherTalk, etc.) so that you
can authenticate yourself on all the places you exist with one login. E-mail comes free with the system and works automagically when multiple
users install the new system.
I haven't used a lot of this system since it's so new, but I sent this
message because it heralds a new era of turnkey mail/network-identity.  I'm
investigating how this works with AppleEvents to see how PGP can be
seamlessly integrated.
A friend of mine went to the product launch at Apple and got a free
"signed" RSA user identification voucher.
I'd be very interested in hearing from others who have a clue about this stuff.

Argh!  I'm using a new mailer that copies *everyone* to the reply field,
which I've noticed only after investigating (prompted by someone's gentle
I'm sending this apology to the list because I'm sensitive to preserving a
high signal-to-noise ration, and I understand that my exchange of attorney
and programmer's jokes with Mike @ EFF should be private mail.  I'll me
more mindful in the future.  Sorry.
Now let me try and make this message add something.  I love the idea of
implementing a digicash system monitored by the list server even though we
haven't finished discussing whether it's play money, or how to charge
exactly.  Getting it up and running and generating usage statistics so we
can see the flow of digicash.
Again, I aplogize for having my private email replies leak onto the list.

Your presentation is interesting, but I believe your conclusion is based
upon a majority sharing your beliefs.  You are in good company.  The
architect of our country, Thomas Jefferson, based his plans on an informed
and educated citizenry.  What we have, however, is a poorly-educated,
easily-swayed populace that considers TV Guide a magazine, makes Married
With Children a hit, and only voted Ronald Raygun / George Bush out of
office only because they saw all their jobs dissapearing (and not even then
understanding it's because of unrestrained spending).

This kind of knee-jerk reaction dismays me.  My response *was* about
cryptography.  Perhaps the following test would prevent you from (1)
wasting bandwidth and (2) turning off people who are trying to put the
flood of crypto info into perspective:
   "Does this email add any value to the discussion?"
Give the rest of us a break; your usual postings are worth reading.

I can barely believe *I* am saying this, given my penchant for nibbling on

Since it seems to have degenerated into a "is not, is too" exchange between

@_subject: Shocked at my reaction 
The following has nothing to do with writing code, but hopefully posting
this will get me back on track....  I wrote this several weeks ago and have
been sitting on it ever since.
L. Detweiler's contributions of late have made me re-examine my feelings on
a variety of email- and cyberspace-related issues.
I very strongly believe that everyone has an inaliable right to express
themselves, as long as that expression doesn't harm others or impede their
ability to express *themselves*.
Up to now the amount of trash-mail (as I determine it) has been less than
ten percent of my mail, an amount I equate with the real-world equivalent
of billboards and junk-mail.  L. Detweiler's uncanny ability to craft
flame-bait and get the CypherPunks to respond has increased the trash-mail
percentage to the point where it's entered my awareness.
Torn between respect for someone who has a reputation for having made
contributions, worry about someone who seems to have a slim grasp on the
reality I'm experiencing, and annoyance at getting scores of ranting
incoherent messages, I've made a decision that I've never made before: to
put someone (L. Detweiler) into my kill-file.  This bothers me a great
But there it is.
To L. Detweiler:  I'm sorry, but your style, content, and quantity values
have gotten to the point where it seems unrewarding to deal with you.  The
decision to banish you bothers me a great deal, but not as much as reading
your mail does.  If you're sincere about the biblical amount of pain you
are in, I gently suggest (in my capacity as an EMT with some
crisis-intervention experience) that you talk about your pain to a
qualified person, perhaps an MFCC.  If you're doing all this to get a
reaction (for maybe a book) like Don Novello's Lazlo character of the last
three decades (and several books), then congratulations.

I just don't get what the big deal is, he seems to be providing info that's
publically available but not trivial to get.  I'm a computer consultant;
that's exactly what *I* do to pay the bills.

@_subject: Codes, ciphers, and ham radio 
And now for something different regarding crypto:
In studying for my FCC Technician's license I ran across FCC 97.113
(Sub-part 113 of Part 97 of Title 47 Code of Federal Regulations), which
prohibits the use of codes or ciphers to obscure the meaning of a message.
Besides preventing me from using Pig Latin in voice communications, this
*seems* to prohibit the use of any deliberate encryption (as opposed to
compression) of data transmitted via radio, such as the computer packet ->
radio -> Internet gateways.
The data highway may be encryption-tolerant today, but the off-ramps are murder.

@_subject: I'm leaving cypherpunks 
I'm very sorry to see you go.  I certainly agree that the list has been
annoying of late, but I disagree that cpunx is a controlled environment,
nor should it be.  I believe that leaving is no solution, but making
heart-felt comments and contributions on one hand and ignoring and
kill-filing obnoxious posters on the other hand is IMHO the most direct
path to a future we are comfortable in.
Again, I'm sorry to see you go.  It feels like a victory for the dark side.

I have a real problem with the attempted marriage of anarchy and the
Bill of Rights.  I'm interested in the issue of privacy not because I want
to screw our government out of my taxes, but because I want to have
the ability to communicate with any of you in private.  At different times
in our history certain opinions have been suspect for what we now consider
no good reason.  If I'm a homosexual, I want to be able to communicate with
others without worrying that my employer will monitor my email and fire
me for being homosexual.  If I'm Jewish, and I work in the deep south...
Privacy is the ability to keep and communicate thoughts without worrying
about someone using them against you.  I'm offended to be clumped in with
anyone who advocates selling privacy to get away with something.

I'm not one to snivel about bandwidth ('cause I think the Internet can
deal with a lot more text messages from us to ourselves), but the
kind of thing that's gotten Perry in the state he's in reminds me of a
time-honored way of dealing with trivial, nonsensical, toxic waste
messages: IGNORE THEM AND THEY'LL GO AWAY.  It's the attention
that's craved.
We now return you to your insightful cypherpunks list, already in

PRZ has specifically said that it is his intention to have no difference
between the output of the PGP and ViaCrypt so that users of the
free-ware version can't be ferreted out.
