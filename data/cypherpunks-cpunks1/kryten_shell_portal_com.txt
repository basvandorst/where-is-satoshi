@_subject: Port Watson 
Anyone who is intrested in T.A.Z should also check out a short story from the
Science Fiction anthology Semiotext SF,"Visit Port Watson".It's wierd how much
the story resembles T.A.Z.The mythical Port Watson is located on the real islandof Sonsorol in the South China Sea,about 400 miles from The Philippines.The Portis a free enclave,a enclave with no laws of any kind.The inhabitants of the island recieve dividends from a bank who has only virtual money.Each citizen recieves and equal share of the dividends which is calculated by computer based on money made by investors.The Bankers are "libertarian computer hacks and anarcho-capitilists".Sounds like CypherPunk Nation to me.Here's the bibiliography info;
 Semiotext(E) SF Copyright 1989 Autonomedia,New York.Ed.Peter Lamborn Wilson andRudy Rucker.

@_subject: REAL WORLD ENCRYPTION 
My Real World intrest in crypto is in preserving my freedom of speech and action in the face of a government who continues to try and deny those rights to me.
 As many on the list have said,we cannot always trust the government to uphold the rights granted in the constitution.With crypto,I hope a measure of self-gurantee will come about so we won't have to rely on government trust.Freedom of
speech is a real world thing,we use it everyday.Any crypto product that enhancesthat use and protects it,I would use.In addition,economic freedom is something
I would be intrested in using(as i watch more of my cash go to government).

@_subject: Source Level 
Eric,
 In your idea to give usenet users a chance to have competing moderated groups
with unmoderated ones.Don't you think that the large numbers who want a moderated group will kill all demand for the unmoderated ones?Then we would be
left with only moderated groups,who grated would have more signal to noise but
less lively debate.People post so much to groups because they know they can in
a free manner,moderation would slow the onslaught of banal posts and plenty of
posts from folks who think thier ideas too wild for the moderator.Remember the
root of moderator is moderate.As in,"This food is moderately good."

@_subject: Other Spy Agencies 
We have talked plenty on the list about the NSA.What about the spy agencies of
other nations?What do they have to offer in the way of crypto roadblocks.Maybe
an exchange of crypto ideas could turn up intresting info from foreign agencies
 But I can picture life in San Quentin for espinoge.I can see the scene now,
 "Im in for triple murder,how about you? I got 40 years for telling the Swedes
about RSA so don't screw with me pal!Crypto huh,your one sick con."
