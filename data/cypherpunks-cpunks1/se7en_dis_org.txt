@_subject: Email Bombing 
Two messages were sent from my account to dc-stuff having me taking credit for email bombs against certain people, namely: Jeff Slaton, Captain Crunch and the Cyberangels.
I first became aware of these emails after receiving a message from Emmanuel Goldstein asking about who was doing this, as his email box was being slaughtered at that very moment.
I *DID NOT* email bomb anyone. This is going to be hard to believe since those mentioned as targets of annihilation were people I have fucked with in the past very openly on dc-stuff. This combined with the current "blame everything on se7en" attitude makes it very hard for anyone to take this professed innocence seriously.
I called my SysAdmin this morning at 4:00 AM PST and he ran through the logs of my account. The emails did in fact come from my account, but, the logs show unusual activity which can't be accounted for by either side. Fortunately, the logs show that the actual bombing was not done from my I was on IRC for several hours talking to trusted friends while this all happened. Whoever penetrated my account knew what the hell they were doing in respects to log modification. A re-install is in process as well as a tightening of overall site security, especially my account.
I am not really upset other than my email account was used to take credit for something I didn't do. My account could have been used for more nefarious purposes; it wasn't. Veterans of dc-stuff know I am not afraid to take credit for the things I do. I did not do this. But I will also not lose any sleep over the Spam King being hit. Captain Crunch: well, after all is said and done, he is harmless. Same with the CyberAngels: they can talk the talk, but can't walk the walk. I have proved that many times. In the end, they are harmless also. Hitting them wouldn't accomplish anything tangible.
At this time, the initial mail headers show the attack was launched via sun.dmci.com from either a netcom.com or an io.* domain. No doubt the account used to launch the attack was hacked. The identity of the bomber may never be known. All I know is that it wasn't me. Take it for what's it worth. Time will vindicate me, as time always does. I just hope it's sooner than later. Hold your judgement of me until such time.
And while dis.org has been recently compromised, I wouldn't be so quick to blame this on the same people. I have had intermediary contact with Galf sufficient for me to believe he made his point and has moved on, having not been responsible for this latest wave of email impersonation. Recent logs have shown that a kind of "open season" has been declared upon dis.org by every newbie out there that has heard of recent events. I say newbie because none of the recent attempts to gain access have proved I used to laugh about email bombing. But when it happens and you are caught up in it, it is not funny. If any of you out there think it is, wait until you find tens of thousands of messages in your inbox and an incoming rate of 750 per minute, every minute. Scripts will not save you.

@_subject: Travelling With Laptops/PGP 
I will be spending a couple of months chilling out in Barcelona, Spain.
I will have a local Internet account/dial-up in that city, and will use it to telnet into my various US-based accounts. This is how I plan to keep in touch with various people while I am gone.
1 - Is the importation of two laptops and it's various peripheral devices by a US citizen into Spain going to be a problem? I know it is in some European countries.
2 - Will having PGP 2.6.2, with 2048-bit keys, or any key length for this matter, installed on these two machines, cause a problem?
3 - What about having SSH and ESM installed on the laptops? Will this set off red flags as well?
Now, I see a work around if this is a problem, but would like advice on this also:
If I generate a temporary PGP key, and distribute it prior to my departure,
and then store it on the US-based server (not a good idea, but it is a temporary key, and if it is not a problem in Spain, SSH and ESM would be in use) then bouncing out of Spain via telnet into US-based computers to process encryption/decryption, key management, etc, any encryption would never actually take place on servers outside of the US. Would this be a viable workaround? Or should I just say fuck it, and just disavow myself of any reason/need for PGP for the duration of my stay? If this is gonna be a problem, I'll just forego anything requiring encryption while I am in Spain.
I have no interest in smuggling crypto in, or defying international law just to use PGP for personal use. If it's not allowed, I simply won't use it. But, I MUST be able to bring my laptops into the country. That HAS to My Research: I tried to find these answers myself via conventioanl methods, and either there was no information available, or the embassy people I spoke to weren't sure. (Go figure!) So now I ask for your opinions.

@_subject: Addendum 
For those who may bring this up, my questions are in relation to Spain's view of my problems, not the US view, as I can bring PGP out of the US In February 1996, the ITAR rules were amended as regards personal use of
cryptography. Temporary export of products for personal use is exempted from the need of a license, provided the exporter takes normal precautions to ensure the security of the product, including locking the product in a hotel room or safe. The product must not be intended for copying, demonstratrion, marketing, sale, re-export, or transfer of ownership or control. In transit, the product must remain with the exporter's accompanying baggage. The exporter must keep records of each export for five years. Export to certain "dangerous" countries (e.g., Cuba, Libya, Syria) is prohibited. See the text of the amendment.

The taped interview lasted more than two hours, with only five minutes airing, so a lot of statements from our mouth is still out of context.
As far as your learning suggestions, I have over 17 years of experience in this "underground community", have owned every type of machine available, can safely guess I have written a large amount of source code equivelent to some of the best, always give it away, and can definitely say I have made more a contribution than you could ever hope for in your wildest dreams. :)
Dealing with the media is a double edge sword. They contacted me, gaveme their bent, and tpaed with me. You can figure out of two hours of tape, that with five minutes showing, vaery mnay important points got left out which would have put aired statements into context. You never know what they, and their editors, ultimately put in the story, for which I have yet to see due to my presence at Defcon.

@_subject: MasterCard Seeks Revision in On-Line Bill 
A MasterCard International official told a congressional committee Wednesday that encryption technology is "vital to the development and security" of a number of its products, including its smart card program.
Joel Lisker, MasterCard International senior vice president for security and risk management, testified in support of the "Promotion of Commerce On-Line an the Digital Era Act" bill.
But he urged that the legislation be amended to address security concerns arising from the resale and reexportation of encryption technology.
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., would allow the unrestricted exportation of mass-market or public-domain encryption programs and permit the exportation of encryption technologies if similar programs are available outside the United States.
Encryption permits a message to be changed into a code that will keep information inaccessible to persons not authorized to have that information.
The bill would promote "cryptographic competition" by making it easier for U.S. companies to export encryption technology and remain competitive with foreign firms that can sell their products freely here, Mr. Lisker But Mr. Lisker urged that the bill be amended to increase the penalties for the rexportation and resale of this technology to questionable buyers, including criminals. "Modernizing the federal regulatory approach to encryption technology must be accomplished without weakening the ability of law enforcement agencies to pursue criminal activity," he Also submitting testimony at Wednesday's hearing before the Senate Subcommittee on science, technology, and space were representatives from Lotus, Netscape, Electronic Data Systems Corp., and America Online.

V-One Corp. said it will be supplying a key security component to the smart card identification and transaction system that Florida State University is developing.
When the system, SmartWorld, is deployed later this year, students will gain access through the Internet to a host of applications touching on many aspects of campus life. Electronic financial transactions over the network will be secured through mutial authentication and encryption aided by the smart card.
V-One said it will provide its SmartGate "middleware," which allows virtually any application to run securely on public networks like the Internet. The agreement also provides for cross-training between V-One and Florida State personnel, and V-One technology will be incorporated in demonstrations that Florida State's Card Application Technology Center makes in marketing its system to other universities and colleges, government agencies, and other organizations.

@_subject: Science Lessons in the Mountains of New Mexico 
Cryptography may not academic science's only contribution to making business work in an unpredictable, technology-driven world. If a growing community of natural scientists, social scientists, and business theorists are right, then the cryptographic algorithms taht make electronic transactions secure will soon seem downright prosaic.
This unusual admixture of pure researchers and real-world practitioners tends to congregate around research institutions in New Mexico, which has been a scientific hotbed ever since the atomic bomb project of the 1940s.
The current thinkers are looking into not just mathematical complexity, but complexity itself. Complexity theory. Complex systems of any definition--the weather, perhaps, or the human immune system, or the organizational behavior of insects--and how their workings and adaptations might hold lessons for other fields, not least business.
It all comes together at the Santa Fe Institute, at a hilltop cul de sac just far enough removed from the New Mexico tourist mecca to give a small community of visiting researchers the distance and quiet they need to contemplate anything from the microbial to the cosmic.
The Santa Fe Institute was founded in 1984 on the idea that molecular biologists, cosmologists, and virtually any other specialists could make interdisciplinary breakthroughs through shared perspectives. "Putting people together from different fields is what we do," said institute vice president L.M. "Mike" Simmons. "The theme is multidisciplinary research on complex systems."
"This is a place where people can get away, exchange ideas, and learn from each other--to harness creativity boundries between fields."
In a classic example, immune-system research cross-pollinated with computer science and produced a computer security technique that protects against viruses and other attacks.
Business and economics are very much in the mix with earth sciences, genetics, and advanced products of computer science like adaptive computation, machine learning, and artificial life. Software guru Esther Dyson, retired BankAmerica Corp. chairman Leland Prussia, and Stewart Brand of Whole Earth Catalog fame are institute trustees.
Kenneth Arrow, the Stanford University economist and Nobel Prize winner, sits on the institute's science board. The board's co-chairmen are trustees Murray Gell-Mann, a Nobel Laureate in physics from California Institute of Technology, and John Holland, a leading complexity theorist from the University of Michigan.
Prof. Gell-Mann happens to be "in residence" on the subject of "complexity, entropy, and teh physics of information."
In 1994, Santa Fe Institute launched a Business Network for Complex Systems Research. The more than 25 members include Allied/Signal, Boston Consulting Group, John Deere, Ernst & Young, McKinsey & Co., Pacific Bell, Shell, and one financial services representative--Citicorp.
The members each pay $25,000 a year to support the institute's complex systems research. In return, they have access to the research and the scientists, meet periodically to pursue and share lessons, and nad send representatives to summer school to rub shoulders with doctoral fellows.
Citicorp has sadi little about its involvement or what it gets out of it. "They've been a big supporter since our first economics program in 1987," Mr. Simmons said. "I can only conclude that they support the mission of pure research."
Citicorp has gone so far as to endow a Santa Fe Institute professorship, held by Stanford economist Brain Arthur, who directs the program on "The Economy as a Complex Adaptive System." Mr. Arthur has done some deep thinking about how knowledge- and information-based economic forces turn the iron law of diminishing returns on its head. His notion of "increasing returns"--defined by Wired magazine as "the more you sell, the more you sell"--influenced the Justice Department in its decision to block the proposed Microsoft-Intuit merger last year.
Mr. Arthur presumably has influenced Citicorp's strategic thinking. Colin Crook, the bank's chief technology officer, quotes him liberally in campaigning for a more "adaptive" organization and culture.
Meanwhile, the Citicorp-Santa Fe axis is spawning synergistic byproducts of its own.
The Financial Services Technology Consortium, a group of 14 mostly large U.S. banks that Citicorp organized to explore and test emerging payment and communications technologies, has worked closely with the Department of Energy's national research laboratories. Santa Fe is conveniently situated between two of them--Sandia, to the south in Albuquerque, and Los Alamos, a half-hour drive northwest--and many consortium meetings have been held in the area on such subjects as data security, biometric identification, and fraud control. Plenty of Los Alamos brainpower--Mr. Simmons himself spent much of his career there--is now concentrated at the Santa Fe Institute.
The Smart Card Forum, another initiative of Mr. Crook's Citicorp technology office, has parallel Santa Fe connections that may be getting stronger. Catherine Allen, the former Citibank vice president and founding chairman of the Smart Card Forum, has settled in New Mexico to launch a consulting firm, the Santa Fe Group. She expects to keep working for the forum and on card-technology advances while pursuing new ideas and business opportunities in emerging management and complexity theories.
Ms. Allen has developed close ties to the Santa Fe Center for Management Strategy, which has been trying to link the Santa Fe Institute principles with business problems in a seminar series called "Complexity and Strategy in Action." The collaboration may result in one or more ongoing forums to expose business people from various industries and disciplines to the new ideas. The management center was organized by Howard Sherman, a successful franchising enteprenuer, one-time philosophy professor, and member of the Santa Fe Institute's business network, whose intellectual quest runs from Plato and Aristotle through Kant to Einstein and Brian Arthur.
"Brian Arthur has said that all business problems and failures are cognitive problems and failures," Mr. Sherman said. "I am interested in the impact of complexity on what he and I call "the cognitive."

While this article is not recent, it is still very interesting.
Because of the size, I have not posted it here. It can be found at:

The question list is:
1. Has the NSA ever imposed or attempted to impose a weakness on any cryptographic code to see if it can thus be broken?
2. Has the NSA ever imposed or attempted to impose a weakness on the DES or DSS?
3. Is the NSA aware of any weaknesses in the DES or the DSS? The RSA?
4. Has the NSA ever taken advantage of any weaknesses in the DES or the
5. Did the NSA play a role in designing the DSS? Why, in the NSA's analysis, was it seen as desirable to create the DSS when the apparently more robust RSA already stood as a de facto standard?
6. What national interests are served by limiting the power of cyptographic schemes used by the public?
7. What national interests are served by limiting the export of cryptographic technology?
8. What national interests are at risk, if any, if secure cryptography is widely available?
9. What does the NSA see as its legitimate interests in the area of cryptography?  Public cryptography?
10. How did NSA enter into negotiations with the Software Publishers Association regarding the export of products utilizing cryptographic techniques? How was this group chosen, and to what purpose? What statute or elected representative authorized the NSA to engage in the
11. What is the status of these negotiations?
12. What is the status of export controls on products uing cryptographic techniques? How would you respond to those who point to the fact that the expot of RSA from the U.S. is controlled, but that its import into the U.S. is not?
13. What issues would you like to discuss that I have not addressed?
14. What question or questions would you like to pose of your critics?

merchant software. Terms of the deals were not disclosed.
A third piece of Verifone's electronic commerce offering, VWallet, will be available once the MasterCard-Visa Secure Electronic Transactions protocol for credit card payments on the Net is adopted.
Banks can use the Verifone technology to deliver private-labeled Internet

Paymentech join a user list that includes Wells Fargo & Co., Royal Bank of
Canada, and Hitechniaga/MBf Group of Malaysia.
BankAmerica's merchant services unit, which recently announced an initial public offering as a stand-alone business, processes credit and debit card sales for more than 150,000 merchants. First USA Paymentech ranks third in the merchant business. Its credit card issuing affiliate, First USA Bank, is one of the largest.
Roger Bertman, a vice president at Verifone, said the reason these banks "are
investing heavily in building the infrastructure" is because "the credit card will be the preeminent [on-line] payment instrument."

that if one has administrator access to the 'NT box' than she could
decrypt the passwords because of NT's lax cryptography. When asked about
the possibility that her exploits come out of other areas, such as
bugtraq or dcstuff, Meinel replied with "Oh, I'd say I only get %5 from
the other lists." When asked again, she came back with "Ok, well about

x-ploit in NT that should be fixed."

than decryption is not possible. If you look at the NT manuals, you will
notice that they have always cautioned to use really big passwords.

@_subject: My War 
Way back when in 1995 when I stopped lurking on this list and became a regular poster, one of the things I quickly became known for was my on-line harrassment of those who had stepped over the line in one manner or another in a way that would ultimately hurt us as a group overall.
Many old-timers here will remember my harrassment of Curtis Sliwa and Colin Hatcher of the Cyberangels (a.k.a. Guardian Angels). These were the fools who organized a worldwide volunteer police-wannabe force that searched out indecency (in the generic and ill-defined sense of the term) on the net, which when one dug further into their agenda, found it was just a ploy for funding and political power. My incessant harrassment led to the revelation of many things, most importantly that their leader had never ever been on the WWW, stating that he didn't have time to do so. This despite the fact he had time to organize a police force to patrol it.
There have been many others since then, most not as evil as the Cyberangels. They each had their own reasons for harrassment. Among some of them have been Carolyn Meinel, O.J. Simpson, Captain Crunch, and As many of you know, I make a living as a professional speaker, with federal government, military and intelligence communities as my core audience. Let me put any fears anyone may have to rest: my work concentrates in Information Technology more than anything else, and if I get into hackers and hacking, it is more pro-hacker than anything else. I am working to improve our image as a community of talented individuals.
I recently went off on a serious rant with three different audiences on a topic I felt was seriously exaggerated/over-hyped/fearmongered/bullshit. That topic was child pornography on the Internet. If you believed the press, child pornography was all over the Internet and easy to get. This brought about even more press and some action by our legislators to crack down on the Internet.
I conducted an eight-week long search for child pornography late last year in the middle of this hype. I searched for, followed literally tens of thousands of links and hacked into pay/private porno servers all over the world. My opinion based on my results, which were not having found a single picture of child pornography anywhere, was that this whole topic was a bunch of bullshit.
Well, that all changed a few days ago. I had asked for a software crack in a public USENET forum to override the NT4.0 Server 120 day time limit. While never receiving the crack, some idiot from an anonymous address sent me a child porn .jpg file. Trust me when I say it was child porn; the girl was no older than four years old and was very graphic. I immediately deleted all trace of the message/attachment. I was also very pissed to say the least that some asshole sent me this.
I looked around on IRC on  and by whois'ing several operators, found more insidious channels. Among them are:
There are many others. I joined several of these channels and found that upon entering each one, I was auto messaged about special kiddie porn servers dedicated to trading, e.g.,
PreTeenSexPics - FTP at 130.67.80.230 l/p ncc/ncc [|]
I logged onto several of these servers, and upon doing an ls-la found directories dedicated, among others, to child pornography. CD'ing into these directories listed several hundreds of files such as:
These are some of over several hundreds of files in a single directory on a single server. There were dozens of servers. I learned the protocol to download on these servers was to uplaod pictures you owned and then the operator would give you "credits" of various ratios for downloading, i.e., upload two pictures, you get credit to download one picture. I uploaded generic garbage pics off of a commercial adult web site, and recived credit to download three pics. What I saw wanted to make me physically vomit (yes, these pics are long since overwritten with 1's and 0's and destroyed). To put any doubts at rest, the material was real and fit the names of the files mentioned above.
I was also actively sent private messages by those looking to trade. I asked what they had, and the usual response was "anything and everything." Some of the more common messages were:
"I have 4-12 year old girls both action or pose."
"I have little boys and girls alone or together."
"I specialize in adults with 4-8 year old girls."
I started logging the channels. I wanted to silently gather IP addresses and email addresses. These people needed some genuine hacker terror. Among some of the more active and persistent traders were:
(*denotes server in operation)
* SylphFox has a ftp at 206.246.162.183 1:2 ratio, anon login
* *  name: Lewis Johnson
 name: Tuyen Ha
This log was generated in thirty minutes on  If their email address appears above, it indicates they were actively offering trades or had servers in operation. These people listed above *were not* passive participants in the rooms. This represents only a small sampling of the overall people in the room at the time. Average number of people in each room varies, but seems to number about 40 people per room.
I logged out of IRC, and then went to USENET, in such rooms as:
There I found several hundreds upon hundreds of .jpg files of real child pornography. Several messages also pointed to some WWW sites, such as:
For someone who took a virtual tour of the kiddie porn world for only one day, I had the opportunity to download enough files to fully max out an IOmega 100MB ZIP disc. **This is not an exaggeration.** Imagine how much could be, and has, been downloaded by those who are regular participants in this activity.
Well, this whole situation is unacceptable. First, I would like to apologize to all those who have hired me in the past, and were subject to my emotional rants about how the whole subject was bullshit and not real. It is very real. It is disgustingly real. It is so real it will make you want to throw up, and I actually, physically did throw up last night.
Second, in reference to previous conversation over the years on this list, and in the hacking community in general, I know this type of activity is not tolerated by us. I have given you enough information above to start identifying the players in this and the places they congregate. It would be my sincere hope that hackers of all abilities would spend a few moments each day and put their talents to use against these people.
Yes, I am advocating malicious, destructive hacking activity against these people. Who are they going to run to? The police? "They hacked my kiddie porn server and rm -rf'd my computer!" Right...the police will be so anxious to lock us up left and right.
These people need to be eradicated from the Internet. While that may never happen completely, enough harrassment will send a message that engaging in this type of activity in very dangerous, and can result in serious harrassment, public embarrassment and computer destruction.
This is my war. It will be a public war. I don't care what happens to me by their community or by law enforcement. I feel secure enough that no jury in the world will convict me for taking these people out. I feel secure enough that no law enforcement agency will ever take action that would place me in front of a jury. And if by some chance I do end up being prosecuted, I know what I did was right.
So, now start the logs of the channels and the actions of those in it. Now starts the public postings of these logs in various places on the Internet. Now starts the harrassment. Now starts the malicious hacking. Now starts the war.
I don't expect people to join me here on this. If you do, you have enough information to start. I caution you to log what is going on, and to make sure you are hitting the guilty, so no innocent people get annihilated in the process. Make damn sure you know who you are hitting and why, and be able to back it up with the idea of having to justify your actions in front of a jury.
And make *REALLY SURE* that if you do come across files of child pornography, that you *OVERWRITE AND DESTROY* these files immediately! You wouldn't want to be the one who ends up being prosecuted for being in possession of this type of material. I would also recommend getting an anonymous email account, such as juno.com, mailmasher.com, hacked, etc., so that you can conduct your activities without fear of the inevitable retribution of those who actively trade this shit when the heat starts getting applied to them.
Of all the people who can help stop this, it is us...hackers. Not law enforcement, not the government, not the media. Not anyone. Just us, hackers who have the talent to do what no one else can.

@_subject: Response to "My War" 
I have been away for most of the day, and came home to see I hit a sensitive spot in one way or another with many people. I tried to respond to many people who sent me private messages, but for some strange ass reason all of my mail is bouncing as "host unknown." I am quite sure aol.com exists. So I am going to try and respond to much of it here. In my long rant, I realized the message was getting too long, and paraphrased some of my larger thoughts. I figured everyone would know what I was trying to get at, but I was wrong. To clarify a few points, before I get to the debate:
I was not advocating the destruction of servers that are used by large numbers of people. I was thinking of the terminology used by the people trading...fserv/ftp servers, many of which are virtual to their desktops which can be shut on and off at will by them as desired. My reference to destruction of servers fit this definition. I don't want to affect large numbers of innocent users to get the few scumbags out there. That is not acceptable. Precision strikes yes, not mass strikes for the "greater good." That is asinine.
Nor was I attempting, as some did point out, to be some sort of "ring leader" in this crusade. I do not plan to organize some large anti-kiddie porn team. I plan on spending a few hours a week, on my own, identifying active participants in this activity. I plan on gathering logs of various types of activity to justify my actions. I plan on taking action which will affect only these individuals. I will make public postings on my own accord to various places on the Internet (dc-stuff WILL NOT be one of these These are things I am doing on my own. If others would like to join the effort, I would ask they do the same thing. Spend a few hours a week in their world to identify the traders and do what you do best to either wreck them or make things a serious hassle for them to continue. I do not want a personal strike team to organize and manage.
As far as freedom of speech goes, sorry guys, it does not cover activities which violate the rights of others. Someone does not have the right to fuck a four-year-old girl in the ass, take pictures of it, and then scan it and upload it to the Internet. No one has the right to force a six year old girl to suck his dick until cum is running down her face, take pictures of the whole thing, and, once again, upload it to the Internet. This is not covered. Go back to school if you think it is.
Anyone who thinks this doesn't affect the young children, you are wrong. I doubt these children consented to the sexual activity. I doubt they consented to being photographed. I doubt they consented to the pictures being distributed to others. I am sure this affects the emotional/psychological state of the child victim in many ways beyond what most of us can understand. I think we can all agree that is creates a less-than-optimal psychological state in the children.
I know my actions are themselves illegal. I am not going to try to morally justify it with comments such as "It's for the greater good," or "What they are doing is more illegal than hacking." I know my actions against these people are illegal, and many for good reason. It is destruction of property. I am honest enough to admit I will be breaking laws. At least I don't try to rationalize it behind some strange, twisted sense of logic. I am not here to force my morals on anyone. If you agree with me, fine. If you have the ability to do something about it, fine. If you disagree, fine. I have had some disagreements against my email/plan/whatever. I have read evry single one of them. I do not hate those who disagree with me. I see the logic in their arguments. I actually encourage it, as it helps me to define what I plan to do better. Everyone has the right to say what they want, whether they agree or not. That includes me, that includes you. This, of course, as long as it doesn't violate the more fundamental rights of others. Agree with me? Yes. Disagree with me? Yes. Distribute child porn. No!
On an interesting note, in instances where I have talked one-on-one with law enforcement agencies in the past, I have thrown several hypothetical cases their way to judge their reaction: (A small glimpse of my Defcon speech)
ME: "If I entered a system without authorization and poked around a left, would you arrest me?"
THEM: "No. We don't have the time or resources for that. We aren't interested in the people who look around without causing damage despite what everyone thinks."
ME: "If I entered a system without authorization and destroyed it, would you arrest me."
THEM: "Most definitely." ME: "If I was at Defcon and entered a system without authorization that was dedicated to the distribution of child pornography and destroyed it, and you were looking over my shoulder the whole time and saw what I did, would you arrest me?"
THEM" "I would turn around and walk away."
