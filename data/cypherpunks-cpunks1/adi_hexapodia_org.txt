Security doesn't work that way.  Keeping your system secure is like
walking a tightrope across a gorge filled with ravenous tigers every
morning.  There are a billion ways to fuck up and get owned/eaten by the
tigers, and asking someone who's successfully walked the tightrope every
day for 40 years "tell me your secret?" completely misses the point.
The expert can share advice and point out when you're about to step off
the tightrope, but no kind of advice can substitute for your own caution
and experience.  Pretending that a magic balance bar, or a magic
technique that can be applied without careful thought, or a magic shoe
that will make you stick to the rope, will save you is the kind of thing
that works in a fairy tale but not in real life.
The analogy breaks down, though, because in fact you can get totally
owned, through and through; exfiltrated, impersonated, and strung up
by a prosecutor before a secret grand jury before you even learn that
your security has failed.  At least the tiger has the courtesy of giving
you pain when you fail.

I believe that there's no law or regulation preventing anyone from
writing open source implementations of GSM in the US.
However there definitely are regulations preventing the sale or
operation of unlicensed intentional emitters, and the FCC definitely
cares about the GSM bands.  Getting a license for an open source
implementation of GSM would likely be a large expense, which AFAIK no
open source implementor has even started to try to undertake.
There is also federal law prohibiting the sale of equipment which can
intercept wireless telephony communications.  Many scanners have
filters or programming/configuration jumpers which prevent reception of
the specific frequencies covered by the law.  Depending on the reading
and the zealousness of the prosecutor, such a law might be seen to be
relevant to an open source GSM platform.

@_subject: [cryptography] Which encryption chips are compromised? 
I believe it's just a guess based on fit.
Suppose I'm the manager writing this document, reporting the expected
accomplishments of my group.  We do cryptanalysis.
If we're projecting success against FooBarCo chips' encryption sub-core,
and everybody knows FooBarCo chips are used in both encryption and
non-encryption products, it makes sense to cite the specific
applications where FooBarCo chips are used.  So "for FooBarCo chips used
in VPN and SSL" makes sense, even if FooBarCo chips are not *solely* VPN
and SSL.
However, in "for FooBarCo encryption chips used in VPN", the
"encryption" seems to me to denote a special purpose chip, rather than a
general purpose chip with an encryption sub-core.  I've seen worse
manglings of language in similar documents, though, so I would not put
it past said middle manager to write "for Intel Ivy Bridge encryption
chips used in VPN and SSL", even though that's a bit of word salad to
anyone who knows the technology.
"Cavium Networks" or "Cavium Nitrox" are approximately the right length
to fit.  Other vendors that might be interesting include F5, Barracuda,
Riverbed, Cisco SCA 11000, Radware (an Israeli/American company), and
everybody listed on The document looks like Word and appears to be fully justified; anyone
with that software want to match the fonts and try out various
substitutions to see what fits best?

are perfectly aligned, to the sub-pixel antialiasing limit; while

non-flatbed scanner; there is significant vertical slew across the line

for both, an enterprising DTP jockey could use -clean-1.pdf to tune the

better unredaction matches.

In reply to Declan tweeting about this discussion (shame on you, Declan,
if you're reading this and trying to take the discussion to the public),
Kevin Poulsen points out
that the Times' comment on this redaction appears to imply that the
redacted text names two chips:
    Large Internet companies use dedicated hardware to scramble traffic
    before it is sent. In 2013, the agency planned to be able to decode
    traffic that was encoded by one of these two encryption chips,
    either by working with the manufacturers of the chips to insert back
    doors or by exploiting a security flaw in the chips' design.
VPN gear lasts in the field for 2-5 years post roll-out.  Design wins
into large provider's hardware will often see the same chip being
manufactured for 2-5 years after it ceases being available at retail.
(ark.intel.com has an "embedded option available?" field to denote the
chips they support this for.)
"Complete Enablement" is jargon with a specific meaning.  I'm not
certain I understand it, but I *think* it means "we have plaintext
access on any targeted session".  I don't think it means "we can get
plaintext for an arbitrary previously recorded session" and I don't
think it means "we automatically get plaintext for every session we can
hear".  Suppose a NSA chip backdoor receives its triggering command by a
specific sequence of TCP retransmits (dropped packets) and after being
triggered, leaks the key by varying the timing or ordering of outbound
packets.  By my reading, this would count as "complete enablement" even
though a session which was not triggered would not be eavesdroppable.
To specifically respond to your point, "Complete enablement" is also
time dependent.  Productionizing a timing side channel attack could
result in complete enablement only for new flows and would still be
complete even though there was no enablement before the attack was

convinced you're right.  "Intel and AMD" is about the right length...

Unlikely; not impossible, but I doubt it was actual retaliation.  Bruce
denies it:
    Schneier told The Register this evening of his departure: "This has
    nothing to do with the NSA. No, they [BT] weren't happy with me, but
    they knew that I am an independent thinker and they didn't try to
    muzzle me in any way. It's just time. I spent seven years at BT, and
    seven years at Counterpane Internet Security, Inc before BT bought
    us. It's past time for something new.
    As to the future: Answer, cloudy; ask again later." Circa 2009 Bruce had some amusing off-the-record stories of previous
interactions with the BT hierarchy.  Bruce at BT was never a clean fit,
but BT profited greatly by, as they say in the article's leaked email,
having someone who can challenge their expectations.
Staying at a single gig for 14 years is quite remarkable in the tech
All that said, there are still things that one Cannot Say when one has
$CORP on one's business card.  Just as a simple example, the doctrine
of "judicial notice" means that if an officer of a corporation makes a
public statement about something and the corporation does not publish a
correction, a court can assume that the statement is true in a later
civil proceeding.  The company can counter the presumption or clarify
the necessary context by presenting evidence, but it's expensive and
means you're burning minutes/pages on refuting nonsense.  So execs need
to be careful not to say, for example, that "$CORP has poor network
security" because that's food for a nuisance lawsuit.
I hope Bruce can use his newfound free time to do additional reporting
on the docs.  Good news!

Silent Circle has some significant credibility gaps.  They repeatedly
claimed, and AFAIK continue to claim, to be "open source", but the
source isn't even available for inspection under restrictive license,
much less actually open source per OSI or DFSG or common sense
guidelines.  They haven't justified or explained this gap in any of
their statements I've seen.
They're trading very heavily on the excellent pedigrees of their
principals, while making outlandish and unsupported claims to credulous
mainstream journalists.
Your participation in their marketing interviews makes you complicit in
this problematic enterprise, Chris.
I think it's incredibly unfair of you to attack Nadim for pointing out
the flaws in this system without addressing your role in those flaws.
We all want privacy and security for users.  Silent Circle's
misappropriation of the "open source" label and hagiographic mainstream
press treatment in advance of actual public review, abetted by a wide
variety of experts and public voices, is deeply problematic for the
liberation technology community's role in civil society.
Silent Circle may be an excellent privacy app.  It might not have any
significant security problems.  It might even do a good job of
mitigating important platform-based attacks and supporting important new
use cases (the "burn after reading" feature).  When it's actually open
source I'll take a look and if it is good, I'll recommend it to users.
Until that open review happens, I think it's inappropriate for voices in
our community to commend or recommend such a proprietary system.  Each
person makes their own choices, of course, and nobody should base their
actions solely on what *I* think is right, but I hope you can hear my
concerns and consider the outcomes of your actions.
