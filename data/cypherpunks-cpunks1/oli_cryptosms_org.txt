@_subject: [liberationtech] jamming satellite phones in Homs 
according to:
"But communication with residents in the district was difficult.
Electricity and phone lines have been cut off, and an activist from the
Syrian Network for Human Rights told Al Jazeera that the government was
using a new technology to jam satellite phone signals."
Anyone any ideas what this "new technology" is?
