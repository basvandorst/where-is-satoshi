@_subject: Filing FOIA Requests 
out exactly what the cheeseballs over in Intelligence, Inc. have on
file about us. Does anyone have handy the details necessary to file a
Freedom of Information Act request for your own file? Do y'all have
some hints so that we can expect the best possible yield?
stories about what you found out when you got your file?
Thanks in advance for the info,

@_subject: DTI Pointers? 
college and into the big wide world, and have decided to educate my
class on the controversy surrounding the Digital Telephony Initiative.
I need hardcopy to make my TA happy, and after an (admittedly quick)
browsing of the archives, I wasn't able to find much in the way of
hard information. Are there any good pointers, especially to the
recent Lehman version of the bill and the controversy that now
surrounds the EFF?
Thanks in advance for your help,

much of Bo, _I'd_ ridicule Bo Gritz if I were on the NYT editorial
staff. If you ever get a chance to see him speak live, do it. He's
definitely the Real Deal. Conspiracy theories, thinly veiled racism,
violence poking from everywhere -- why is this kind of personality so
attracted to Idaho?
into family values / universal military training / trade protection
for United States industries. He falls very close, ideologically,
alongside the state "militias" out in this part of the country. Those
groups also profess libertarianism while also advocating extremely
draconian Christian social programs.
