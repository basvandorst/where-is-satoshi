@_subject: Cypherpunk forgery. 
I just got word from one of my buddies that someone has been forging
my e-mail to cypherpunks talking about the pederast organization
NAMBLA.  The guys at Penn State where the forgery came from have
started to investigate and will bring the perpetrators to a discip-
linary hearing.
Thank you for your co-operation.
BTW:  Below is my real .Sig
