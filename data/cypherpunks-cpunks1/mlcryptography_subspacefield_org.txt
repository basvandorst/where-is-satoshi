Quantum cryptography broken
KurzweilAI.net, April 20, 2008
Two Swedish scientsts, Jorgen Cederlof, now of Google, and Jan-Ake
Larsson of Link In a paper published in IEEE Trans. Inf Theory, 54:
1735-1741 (2008), they point out that an eavesdropper could gain
partial knowledge on the key in quantum cryptography that may have an
effect on the security of the authentication in the later round.
By accessing the quantum channel used in quantum cryptography, the
attacker can change the message to be authenticated (since the message
is influenced by attacker-initiated events on the quantum
channel). This, combined with partial knowledge of the key
(transmitted on the quantum channel), creates a potential security
gap, they suggest.
Their proposed solution: simply transmit an extra exchange of a small
amount of random bits on the classical (Internet) channel.

Reading really old email, but have new information to add.
There was an interesting article in 2600 recently about ATA drive
It's in Volume 26, Number 1 (Spring 2009).  Sorry that I don't have an
electronic copy.
The relevant bit of it is that there are two keys.  One key is for the
user, and one (IIRC, it is called a master key) is set by the factory.
IIRC, there was a court case recently where law enforcement was able
to read the contents of a locked disk, contrary to the vendor's claims
that nobody, even them, would be able to do so.  The man in question
had his drives sized by the FBI and they read the drives, uncovering
emails between the man and his lawyer.  He was suing the manufacturer
for false advertising.
Here are the links from the 2600 article:
