Some folks have asked that the network redirector, driver, and file system source files from CompuServe be made available via ftp. Two of them, cramdi.zip and rdcf2.zip may not be public domain. I've ftp'd the others to soda.berkeley.edu, as well as rdcf.zip, a public domain earlier version of rdcf2.zip. I'm sure Eric will have them visible soon.
I'll contact the authors of cramdi and rdcf2.

Ok, PKP now effectively has a monopoly. Is an antitrust action The timing of this announcement, just after Clipper got set back hard, may be significant. It would have raised far fewer suspicions to put the license out to bid and then make sure PKP got it. My partner, who rejects conspiracy theories out of hand, described the action as "stupid". The folks at Meade may be running scared.
The announcement is viewed by some as unnecessarily verifying PKP as a previously hidden asset. If someone is overreacting, perhaps those fighting for freedom are getting to them.

Sure is; but patents are intended to convey a sharply limited monopoly. I seem to remember Judge Green expressing intense dissatisfaction with interlocking patents used to control an entire industry.
We need info from someone who knows. Mike, are you listening, and are you familiar with antitrust law?

Pure bull puckey. First, they could have let DSA die. The commercial sector, particularly banks, would have come up with alternatives we could trust.
Second, they could do what competent engineers have done for many decades: designed around inconvenient patents. Third, if they knew they weren't up to it, they could have asked for public help in that design.
Fourth, they could have challenged PKP's patents on their merits.
Fifth, they could have worked to get those patents declared void in the public interest. I personally don't support this one until PKP is shown to be primarily government controlled.
They did none of these things. Why?

This statement keeps showing up. If there is any support for it I'd like to hear it.
We know it was not true as far back as twenty years ago, from July 1, 1969 to October 1973.  For details on the MINARET Charter see page 150 of "The National Security Agency and Fourth Amendment Rights", and pages 323 and 324 of "The Puzzle Palace".
NSA has a long history of ignoring whether they are chartered for an activity, of course.
