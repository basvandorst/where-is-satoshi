@_subject: [ZS] Re: Quantified Prestige 
A very interesting read, I feel like it is a very promising idea. I have a few nitpicks with the documents and some more serious intrinsic questions about Fluido. I feel the idea behind Prestige is sound though.
Minor points:
- I am pleased to see that it only implements positive reputation to avoid "karmic bankruptcy", could there be a brief explanatory note about this?
- You mention on page 30 about prestige allocation being optionally fractional, but apart from a throwaway comment about positive rational numbers being the amount for the prestige allocation allowed to a user, it doesn't appear until here. Could one of the examples produced use a fractional amount to clarify this?
- In section 4.3 (p16) the example uses a trust rating of 0.5 but the description of trust levels imply they should be from the naturals, was my reading of this wrong or is the example wrong?
- When talking about allocators in section 2.2.4 (p9) you mention that the creator of the group is the only one with the power to hire/fire managers of the group. I believe that ownership should be transferable, perhaps this should be rephrased as owner of the user circle, or maybe superuser? More substantial questions
- Is the web of trust standard to use unconnectedness except through k? How does this work in mature groups where there is a large amount of connectedness? I'm thinking more where it would be used as a local, restricted reputation model rather than a global one as that would imply a substantially different shaped network.
- Fluido seems, especially when taken as the continuous system seems like it would be particularly susceptable to falling into a trap of metaphorical thinking as a renewable energy source. What implications could this have?
