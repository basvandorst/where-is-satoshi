Data Lock itself may be useful, but its greater value lies in the fact that it
is written more to be used as a function library for people who want to
incorporate encryption into other applications.
The only change from MPJ2 to the Diamond Encryption Algorithm is that the key
expansion mechanism now distinguishes between keys of different lengths.  For
example, the keys "aaaaaaaa" and "aaaaaaaaaaaa" would have been equivalent in
MPJ2, but are not in Diamond.  Diamond Lite is just the logical contraction of
Diamond from a 16 byte (128 bit) block to an 8 byte (64 bit) block.  Even
though "Lite" is in the name, it yields better security for small numbers of
rounds because of the faster avalanche effect (1 bit to 64 in just 2 rounds
instead of 1 bit to 128 in 5 rounds).  MPJ2 and Diamond are derived from the
MPJ encryption algorithm, invented in 1989, but use an improved key scheduling
algorithm that eliminates the slight bias in the way the substitution arrays
were filled.
The following is a comparison of some of the symmetrical key ciphers available
to the general public today.  Included is a (somewhat subjective) strength
comparison to give a general idea of how Diamond and Diamond Lite compare:
ALGORITHM    BLOCK KEY      ROYALTY ECB   RELATIVE  APPROXIMATE WORK FACTOR
NAME         SIZE  SIZE     FREE?   MODE  SPEED     TO BREAK log base 2 of
             BITS  BITS             OK?             number of operations
DES          64    56       YES     YES   MEDIUM    43
3DES         64    112-168  YES     YES   SLOW      64-168
DIAMOND      128   variable YES     YES   MEDIUM    128-key size
DIAMOND LITE 64    variable YES     YES   VERY FAST 64-key size
BLOWFISH     64    variable YES     YES   VERY FAST 64-key size?
SHA-CFB      160   variable YES     NO    VERY FAST 80-160
MD5-CFB      128   variable YES     NO    VERY FAST 64-128
REDOC II     80    160      NO      YES   FAST      80-key size
REDOC III    64    variable NO      YES   VERY FAST 64-key size
KHUFU        64    512      NO      YES   ?         64-512
IDEA         64    128      NO      YES   FAST      64-128
MMB          128   128      ?       YES   FAST      128?
The "work factor to break" column is somewhat subjective, and is based on the
best attacks that I have knowledge of (hardly an exhaustive list), combined
with a GUESS at what attacks might succeed.  They also assume that the key
length is at least as long as the numbers indicated when the key length is
variable.  You should decide for yourself what you will believe. Don't put all
your eggs in one basket.
Besides those things listed above, some distinguishing characteristics of
Diamond and Diamond Lite include:
      * They can easily and securely take a pass phrase directly as a key.
      * They can be extremely fast when implemented in hardware.
      * They allow you to perform some security vs. speed and size tradeoffs.
      * Key setup is designed to make brute force attacks very costly.
OK, this is where I put my money where my keyboard is.  If you are the first
one to correctly decipher my challenge text (CHALLENG.ENC in DLOCK.ZIP),
enciphered with DLOCK.EXE, before midnight UTC, 29 April 1997, and follow the
redemption instructions contained within the challenge text, then I will send
you US$271.82 of my hard-earned money.  You must (1) reveal to me how you did
this, and (2) not break any laws in the process to collect the prize.  I know
that this isn't enough to justify much serious cryptanalysis, but it should
demonstrate that such a challenge is beyond the reach of the average hacker.

@_subject: MacPGP and AOL 
Not to worry, if the check was made to Philip Dubois and marked as going to Philip Zimmermann's legal defense fund, it will be used as advertised.  I have personally met both of these people, and trust them to do what they promised.  Phil Zimmermann is still a free man (last I checked), but being the target of a grand jury investigation has already cost Phil more than sleep and peace of mind.  He has had his lawyer interceding on his behalf as much as possible to prevent an actual indictment, and this does cost money.
Peace to you.

@_subject: fake pgp messages 
What better way than to generate real pgp messages that encrypt noise files?
Just generate pseudorandom binary data of pseudorandom length (biased toward the length of real messages), and encrypt with pgp, using the public key of some person's key from a public server, selected at random.  If you want to be able to spend less cpu time, you could hack a copy of pgp to simulate doing this, of course, using the symmetric key cipher (idea) in a stream cipher mode.
Peace to you.

WHERE TO GET THE PRETTY GOOD PRIVACY PROGRAM (PGP)
(Last modified: 11 August 1994 by Mike Johnson)
WHAT IS THE LATEST VERSION?
There is more than one latest version.  Pick one or more of the following
that best suits your computer, patent restrictions, and export restrictions.
Some countries (like France) may also restrict import or even use of strong
cryptography like PGP.
Note:  there are other versions available, but these are either old, or
outside of the mainstream PGP project.  Look for new versions from one of
three sources:  Viacrypt (Commercial), MIT (North American freeware), or
mathew at mantis.co.uk (the unofficially non-designated holder of the unofficial
international version that parallels what Philip Zimmermann and the rest of
the PGP development team is doing in the USA.
Note that the MIT PGP 2.6 is illegal to export from the USA or Canada, but
using it outside of the USA and Canada for noncommercial use is not illegal
in most countries.  In spite of the best efforts of MIT and the other primary
developers and distributors of PGP not to violate the International Traffic
in Arms Regulations, MIT PGP 2.6 is available on some of the same sites
listed for PGP 2.6ui, below.  The noncommercial use restriction comes from
both the RSAREF license and the patent on the IDEA cipher in Europe and North
WHAT IS ALL THIS NONSENSE ABOUT EXPORT CONTROLS?
For a detailed rant, get ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/cryptusa.zip
The practical meaning, until the law is corrected to make sense, is that you
are requested to get PGP from sites outside of the USA and Canada if you are
outside of the USA and Canada.  If you are in France, I understand that you
aren't even supposed import it.  Other countries may be worse.
WHAT IS THE "TIME BOMB" IN MIT PGP 2.6?
As a concession to the RSA patent holders (in return for endorsement of the
legality of the freeware MIT PGP 2.6), MIT placed an inducement in MIT PGP
2.6 to encourage upgrade from the alledgedly patent-infringing PGP 2.3a to
the MIT version.  The nature of this inducement is a change in a packet ID
byte that causes PGP 2.3a and earlier to reject messages created by MIT PGP
2.6 after 1 September 1994.  Altering MIT PGP 2.6 to bypass this annoyance
(though technically an easy change to the LEGAL_KLUDGE), invalidates the
blessing of Public Key Partners on the licence of MIT PGP 2.6.  Therefore, it
is a bad idea.  On the other hand, it is trivial to hack PGP 2.3a to accept
these packets, and that (plus a few other bug fixes) is essentially what PGP
2.6ui is.  None of the versions of PGP greater than 2.3 have problems reading
the old packet ID values, so for maximum compatibility, the ideal is to write
the old value and accept either value.
Unfortunately, this time bomb has a negative effect on Viacrypt PGP 2.4, as
well, which never infringed on anyone's patents.  Viacrypt's solution was to
issue PGP 2.7, which, by default acts just like MIT PGP 2.6, but has a
config.txt option (explained in the release) that allows compatibility with
both PGP 2.4 and PGP 2.6.  Naturally, this also allows compatibility with PGP
The time bomb is annoying for those who still wish to use PGP 2.3a, and for
those who use Viacrypt PGP 2.4 and don't want to spend US$10 to upgrade to
Viacrypt PGP 2.7, but considering the magnitude of the concession made by
Public Key Partners in legitimizing the freeware PGP for use in the USA, it
was worth it.
ARE MY KEYS COMPATIBLE WITH THE OTHER PGP VERSIONS?
If your RSA key modulus length is less than or equal to 1024 bits (I don't
recommend less, unless you have a really slow computer and little patience),
and if your key was generated in the PKCS format, then it will work with any
of the mainstream PGP versions (PGP 2.3a, Viacrypt PGP 2.4, MIT PGP 2.6, PGP
2.6ui, or Viacrypt PGP 2.7).  If this is not the case, you really should
generate a new key that qualifies.
Philip Zimmermann is aware of the desire for longer keys in PGP by some PGP
fans (like me), but wants to migrate towards that goal in an orderly way, by
first releasing versions of PGP in for all platforms and for both commercial
(Viacrypt) and freeware (MIT) flavors that ACCEPT long keys, then releasing
versions that can also GENERATE long keys.  He also has some other neat key
management ideas that he plans to implement in future versions.
WHAT ARE THE KNOWN BUGS IN PGP?
These are the most annoying:
MIT PGP 2.6 -- the function xorbytes doesn't.  Replace the = with ^= to fix
               it.  The effect of this bug is that RSA keys aren't quite as
               random as they should be -- probably not a practical problem,
               but worth fixing if you are going to compile the code
               yourself.
MIT PGP 2.6 -- DON'T SET PGPPASS when editing your keys, because if you do,
               and if you don't change your pass phrase, the key is lost.
               (If this happens, rename your backup keyring files to the
               primary files before you do anything else).
PGP 2.6ui --   Conventional encryption -c option doesn't use a different IV
               every time, like it is supposed to.  (PGP 2.3a had this
               problem, too).
WHERE CAN I GET VIACRYPT PGP?
Versions are available for DOS, Unix, or WinCIM/CSNav
Commercial software.  Call 800-536-2664 to order.
If you are a commercial user of PGP in the USA or Canada, contact Viacrypt in
Phoenix, Arizona, USA.  The commecial version of PGP is fully licensed to use
the patented RSA and IDEA encryption algorithms in commercial applications,
and may be used in corporate environments in the USA and Canada.  It is fully
compatible with, functionally the same as, and just as strong as the freeware
version of PGP. Due to limitations on ViaCrypt's RSA distribution license,
ViaCrypt only distributes executable code and documentation for it, but they
are working on making PGP available for a variety of platforms.  Call or
write to them for the latest information.  The latest version number for
their version of PGP is 2.7.
Upgrade from Viacrypt PGP 2.4 to 2.7 is free if you bought version 2.4 after
May 27, 1994, otherwise the upgrade is US$10.
Viacrypt's licensing and price information is as follows:
ViaCrypt PGP for MS-DOS             1 user        $  99.98
ViaCrypt PGP for MS-DOS             5 users       $ 299.98

WHERE CAN I GET MIT PGP?
MIT PGP is Copyrighted freeware.
Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu, log in as getpgp, answer the questions, then ftp
to net-dist.mit.edu and change to the hidden directory named in the telnet
session to get your own copy.
MIT-PGP is for U. S. and Canadian use only, but MIT is only distributing it
within the USA (due to some archaic export control laws).
1.  Read ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/mitlicen.txt and agree to it.
2.  Read ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/rsalicen.txt and agree to it.
3.  Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu and log in as getpgp.
4.  Answer the questions and write down the directory name listed.
5.  QUICKLY end the telnet session with ^C and ftp to the indicated directory
    on net-dist.mit.edu (something like /pub/PGP/dist/U.S.-only-????) and get
    the distribution files (pgp26.zip, pgp26doc.zip, pgp26src.tar.gz,
    MacPGP2.6.sea.hqx, and MacPGP2.6.src.sea.hqx).
    If the hidden directory name is invalid, start over at step 3, above.
File names (shortened file names are for DOS BBS distribution):
pgp26doc.zip - documentation only
pgp26.zip    - includes DOS executable & documentation
pgp26src.zip - source code
pgp26src.tar or pgp26src.tar.gz - source code release for Unix and others
macpgp26.hqx or MacPGP2.6.sea.hqx - Macintosh executable & documentation

pgp26os2.zip - OS/2 executable (may not be on the MIT archive)
RSA and IDEA algorithms licenced for personal and noncommercial use.
Uses RSAREF, which may not be modified without RSADSI permission.
Contains "time bomb" to start generating messages incompatible with PGP 2.3
and 2.4 on 1 September 1994 as an incentive for people to not use PGP 2.3a in
the USA, which RSADSI claims infringes on their patents.  Mac versions are
not yet Applescriptable.  This version is not intended for export from the
USA and Canada due to the USA's International Traffic in Arms Regulations and
Canada's corresponding regulations.

    The NCSA Forum sysops have a library that is available only to people who
send them a message asserting that they are within the U. S. A.  This library
contains PGP.  I have also seen PGP 2.6 in some other places on Compuserve.
Try searching for PGP26.ZIP in the IBMFF forum for up-to-date information on
PGP in selected other areas.  The last time I tried a search like this, PGP
2.6 was found in the PC World Online forum (GO PWOFORUM) new uploads area,
along with several PGP shells and accessories.  I've also heard that
EUROFORUM caries PGP 2.6ui, but have not confirmed this.
Compuserve file names are even more limited than DOS, so the file names to
look for are PGP26.ZIP, PGP26S.ZIP (source code), and PGP26D.ZIP
(documentation only).

PGP26.ZIP is being distributed on FIDONET.
WHERE CAN I GET PGP FOR USE OUTSIDE OF THE USA?
The latest for outside the USA is the "Unofficial International" PGP 2.6 for
most platforms, MacPGP 2.3aV1.2 for the Mac (although 2.6ui is under
development and should appear very soon), and 2.3a.4 for the Amiga.  The
latest amiga version is fully compatible with MIT's PGP 2.6.
Copyrighted freeware.
Version 2.6ui released by mathew at mantis.co.uk.
Amiga version 2.3a4 released by Peter Simons These versions do NOT use RSAREF.  No RSA patent problems outside the USA, but
this version is not legal for commercial or extensive personal use in the
USA.  IDEA licensed for presonal use only in countries where the IDEA patent
The freeware version of PGP is intended for noncommercial, experimental, and
scholarly use.  It is available on thousands of BBSes, commercial information
services, and Internet anonymous-ftp archive sites on the planet called
Earth.  This list cannot be comprehensive, but it should give you plenty of
pointers to places to find PGP.  Although the latest freeware version of PGP
was released from outside the USA (England), it is not supposed to be
exported from the USA under a strange law called the International Traffic in
Arms Regulations (ITAR).  Because of this, please get PGP from a site outside
the USA if you are outside of the USA and Canada.  Even though the RSAREF
license associated with PGP 2.6 from MIT no longer prohibits use outside the
USA, it still carries the not-for-profit restriction that the original RSA
code in PGP 2.6ui doesn't have.  On the other hand, patents on the IDEA
cipher may limit PGP use in your country to nonprofit applications, anyway.
Indeed, I understand that there are some countries where private electronic
mail is not legal, anyway.
These listings are subject to change without notice.  If you find that PGP has
been removed from any of these sites, please let me know so that I can update
this list.  Likewise, if you find PGP on a good site elsewhere (especially on
any BBS that allows first time callers to access PGP for free), please let me
know so that I can update this list.

If you find a version of the PGP package on a BBS or FTP site and it does not
include the PGP User's Guide, something is wrong.  The manual should always
be included in the package.  If it isn't, the package is suspect and should
not be used or distributed.  The site you found it on should remove it so
that it does no further harm to others.

@_author: Michael Paul Johnson 
@_subject: The Sapphire Stream Cipher 
THE SAPPHIRE STREAM CIPHER
The Sapphire Stream Cipher is designed to have the following properties:
 * Be useful for generation of cryptographic check values as well as
   protecting message privacy.
 * Accept a variable length key.
 * Strong enough to justify _at least_ a 64 bit key for balanced security.
 * Small enough to be built into other applications with several keys active
   at once.
 * Key setup fast enough to support frequent key change operations but slow
   enough to discourage brute force attack on the key.
 * Fast enough to not significantly impact file read & write operations on
   most current platforms.
 * Portable among common computers and efficient in C, C++, and Pascal.
 * Byte oriented.
 * Include both ciphertext and plain text feedback (for both optimal data
   hiding and value in creation of cryptographic check values).
 * Acceptable performance as a pure pseudorandom number generator without
   providing a data stream for encryption or decryption.
 * Design in a little extra strength where there is doubt about what attacks
   might be a threat.
HISTORY AND RELATED CIPHERS
The Sapphire Stream Cipher is very similar to a cipher I started work on in
November 1993.  It is also similar in some respects to the alledged RC-4 that
was posted to sci.crypt recently.  Both operate on the principle of a
mutating permutation vector.  Alledged RC-4 doesn't include any feedback of
ciphertext or plain text, however.  This makes it more vulnerable to a known
plain text attack, and useless for creation of cryptographic check values. On the other hand, alledged RC-4 is faster.
The Sapphire Stream Cipher is used in the shareware product Quicrypt, which
is available at ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/qcrypt10.zip and on the Colorado
Catacombs BBS (303-772-1062).  There are two versions of Quicrypt:  the
exportable version (with a session key limited to 32 bits but with strong
user keys allowed) and the commercial North American version (with a session
key of 128 bits).  A variant of the Sapphire Stream Cipher is also used in
the shareware program Atbash, which has no weakened exportable version.
I don't recall ever reading anything about using a stream cipher like this
for the generation of cryptographic check values, but it seems like it should
be a fast technique compared to some existing hash functions.
The Sapphire Stream Cipher is based on a state machine.  The state consists
of 5 index values and a permutation vector.  The permutation vector is simply
an array containing a permutation of the numbers from 0 through 255.  Five of
the bytes in the permutation vector are moved to new locations (which may be
the same as the old location) for every byte output.  The output byte is a
nonlinear function of all 5 of the index values and 7 of the bytes in the
permutation vector, thus frustrating attempts to solve for the state
variables based on past output.  On initialization, the index variables are
set (somewhat arbitrarily) to 1, 3, 5, 7, and 11.  The permutation vector
(called the cards array in the source code below) is shuffled based on the
user key.  This shuffling is done in a way that is designed to minimize the
bias in the destinations of the bytes in the array.  The biggest advantage in
this method is not in the elimination of the bias, per se, but in slowing
down the process slightly to make brute force attack more expensive. Eliminating the bias (relative to that exhibited by RC-4) is nice, but this
advantage is probably of minimal cryptographic value.
KEY SETUP
Key setup (illustrated by the function initialize(), below) consists of three
    1.  Initialize the index variables.
    2.  Set the permutation vector to a known state (a simple counting
        sequence).
    3.  Starting at the end of the vector, swap each element of the
        permutation vector with an element indexed somewhere from 0
The keyrand() function returns a value between 0 and some maximum number
based on the user's key, the current state of the permutation vector, and an
index running sum called rsum.  Note that the length of the key is used in
keyrand(), too, so that a key like "abcd" will not result in the same
permutation as a key like "abcdabcd".
Each encryption involves updating the index values, moving (up to) 5 bytes
around in the permutation vector, selecting an output byte, and adding the
output byte bitwise modulo-2 (exclusive-or) to the plain text byte to produce
the cipher text byte.  The index values are incremented by different rules. The index called rotor just increases by one (modulo 256) each time.  Ratchet
increases by the value in the permutation vector pointed to by rotor. Avalanche increases by the value in the permutation vector pointed to by another byte in the permutation vector pointed to by the last cipher text
byte.  The last plain text and the last cipher text bytes are also kept as
index variables.  See the function called encrypt(), below for details.
PSUEDORANDOM BYTE GENERATION
If you want to generate random numbers without encrypting any particular
ciphertext, simply encrypt 0.  There is still plenty of complexity left in
the system to ensure unpredictability (if the key is not known) of the output
stream when this simplification is made.
Decryption is the same as encryption, except for the obvious swapping of the
assignments to last_plain and last_cipher and the return value.  See the
function decrypt(), below.

GENERATION OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC CHECK VALUES (HASH VALUES)
For a fast way to generate a cryptographic check value (also called a hash or
message integrity check value) of a message of arbitrary length, simply
generate a set of 20 bytes (160 bits) by encrypting zeroes.  The output so
generated is the cryptographic check value.  To generate a cryptographic
check value when message integrity is desired but encryption is not (for
example, as part of a digital signature process), either use a "standard" key
(like four bytes of zero) or simply bypass the "card shuffling" part of the
key setup (for even more speed).  The plain text is still fed to the encrypt
function, but the ciphertext is discarded until the check value is generated.
SECURITY ANALYSIS
There are several security issues to be considered.  Some are easier to
analyze than others.  The following includes more "hand waving" than
mathematical proofs, and looks more like it was written by an engineer than a
mathematician.  The reader is invited to improve upon or refute the
following, as appropriate.
KEY LENGTH
There are really two kinds of user keys to consider: (1) random binary keys,
and (2) pass phrases.  Analysis of random binary keys is fairly straight
forward.  Pass phrases tend to have much less entropy per byte, but the
analysis made for random binary keys applies to the entropy in the pass
phrase.  The length limit of the key (255 bytes) is adequate to allow a pass
phrase with enough entropy to be considered strong.
To be real generous to a cryptanalyst, assume dedicated Sapphire Stream
Cipher cracking hardware.  The constant portion of the key scheduling can be
done in one cycle.  That leaves at least 256 cycles to do the swapping
(probably more, because of the intricacies of keyrand(), but we'll ignore
that, too, for now).  Assume a machine clock of about 256 MegaHertz (fairly
generous).  That comes to about one key tried per microsecond.  On average,
you only have to try half of the keys.  Also assume that trying the key to
see if it works can be pipelined, so that it doesn't add time to the
estimate.  Based on these assumptions (reasonable for major governments), and
rounding to two significant digits, the following key length versus cracking
time estimates result:
    Key length, bits    Time to crack
    ----------------    -------------
                  32    35 minutes (exportable in qcrypt)
Naturally, the above estimates can vary by several orders of magnitude based
on what you assume for attacker's hardware, budget, and motivation.
In the range listed above, the probability of spare keys (two keys resulting
in the same initial permutation vector) is small enough to ignore.  The proof
is left to the reader.
INTERNAL STATE SPACE
For a stream cipher, internal state space should be at least as big as the
number of possible keys to be considered strong.  The state associated with
the permutation vector alone (256!) constitutes overkill.
PREDICTABILITY OF THE STATE
If you have a history of stream output from initialization (or equivalently,
previous known plaintext and ciphertext), then rotor, last_plain, and
last_cipher are known to an attacker.  The other two index values, flipper
and avalanche, cannot be solved for without knowing the contents of parts of
the permutation vector that change with each byte encrypted.  Solving for the
contents of the permutation vector by keeping track of the possible positions
of the index variables and possible contents of the permutation vector at
each byte position is not possible, since more variables than known values
are generated at each iteration.  Indeed, fewer index variables and swaps
could be used to achieve security, here, if it were not for the hash
CRYPTOGRAPHIC CHECK VALUE
The relatively large portion of the state altered with each byte encrypted
(relative to alledged RC-4) contributes to a rapid avalanche of generated
check values -- probably more than is needed.  A single bit change in a
message causes a radical change in the check value generated (about half of
the bits change).  This is one good feature of a cryptographic check value.
Another good property of a cryptographic check value is that it is too hard
to compute a message that results in a certain check value.  In this case, we
assume the attacker knows the key and the contents of a message that has the
desired check value, and wants to compute a bogus message having the same
check value.  There are two obvious ways to do this attack.  One is to solve
for a sequence that will restore the state of the permutation vector and
indices back to what it was before the alteration.  The other one is the
so-called "birthday" attack that is to cryptographic hash functions what
brute force is to key search.
To generate a sequence that restores the state of the cipher to what it was
before the alteration probably requires at least 256 bytes, since the index
"rotor" marches steadily on its cycle, one by one.  The values to do this
cannot easily be computed, due to the nonlinearity of the feedback, so there
would probably have to be lots of trial and error involve.  In practical
applications, this would leave a gaping block of binary garbage in the middle
of a document, and would be quite obvious, so this is not a practical attack,
even if you could figure out how to do it (and I haven't).  If anyone has a
method to solve for such a block of data, though, I would be most interested
in finding out what it is.  Please email me at m.p.johnson at ieee.org if you
find one.
The "birthday" attack just uses the birthday paradox to find a message that
has the same check value.  With a 20 byte check value, you would have to find
at least 80 bits to change in the text such that they wouldn't be noticed (a
plausible situation), then try the combinations until one matches.  2 to the
80th power is a big number, so this isn't practical either.  If this number
isn't big enough, you are free to generate a longer check value with this
algorithm.  Someone who likes 16 byte keys might prefer 32 byte check values
for similar stringth.
OTHER HOLES
Are there any?  Take you best shot and let me know if you see any.  I offer
no challenge text with this algorithm, but you are free to use it without
royalties to me if it is any good.
LEGAL STUFF
The intention of this document is to share some research results on an
informal basis.  You may freely use the algorithm and code listed above as
far as I'm concerned, as long as you don't sue me for anything, but there may
be other restrictions that I am not aware of to your using it.  The C++ code
fragment above is just intended to illustrate the algorithm being discussed,
and is not a complete application.  I understand this document to be
Constitutionally protected publication, and not a munition, but don't blame
me if it explodes or has toxic side effects.

WHERE TO GET THE PRETTY GOOD PRIVACY PROGRAM (PGP)
(Last modified: 13 December 1994 by Mike Johnson)
WHAT IS THE LATEST VERSION?

WHERE CAN I GET THE PGP VERSION DIRECTLY FROM PHILIP ZIMMERMANN?
This is the MIT version.  For several good reasons, Phil is releasing the
main line freeware PGP through MIT, at net-dist.mit.edu.  See a list of sites
that also carry this version, below, or use this WWW URL:
    WHAT IS PGP 2.6.i?
Stale Schumacher  released an international version of
PGP built the "right way."  By "right way," I mean that it uses the latest
MIT code, but uses a different rsaglue.c to use the mpilib instead of RSAREF
for RSA calculations, thus including all the latest bug fixes and features in
the main freeware PGP code line, but frees non-USA persons from the
limitations of the RSAREF license.  This release has been as strongly
endorsed by Philip Zimmermann as he can do without incriminating himself.
Naturally, by not using the RSAREF code for RSA calculations, this version is
not legal for use in the USA (other than limited research, etc.), but is fine
anywhere else (like Canada) were RSA patents don't hold.
Note that the latest version of Stale Schumacher's PGP is 2.6.i, 2.6i
(without the second .) was a beta test version that has been superceded.
WHAT IS PGP 2.6ui?
The "unofficial international" versions are really just PGP 2.3a, modified
just enough to make it compatible with MIT PGP 2.6, but do not include all of
the fixes in MIT PGP 2.6 and MIT PGP 2.6.1.  They have a "ui" somewhere in
their file names.  I recommend the use of the "ui" versions only if you are
using a platform for which there is no Viacrypt or MIT PGP that works
properly.  For a version that doesn't use RSAREF, PGP 2.6.i from Stale
Schumacher is a better choice, because it is more up-to-date.
WHERE CAN I GET VIACRYPT PGP?
If you are a commercial user of PGP in the USA or Canada, contact Viacrypt in
Phoenix, Arizona, USA.  The commecial version of PGP is fully licensed to use
the patented RSA and IDEA encryption algorithms in commercial and government
environments in the USA and Canada.  It is fully compatible with, functionally
the same as, and just as strong as the freeware version of PGP. Due to
limitations on ViaCrypt's RSA distribution license, ViaCrypt only distributes
executable code and documentation for it, but they are working on making PGP
available for a variety of platforms.  Call or write to them for the latest
information.  The latest version number for Viacrypt PGP is 2.7.
Here is a brief summary of Viacrypt's currently-available products:
1. ViaCrypt PGP for MS-DOS.  Prices start at $99.98
2. ViaCrypt PGP for UNIX.  Includes executables for the following
   platforms:
     SunOS 4.1.x (SPARC)
     IBM RS/6000 AIX
     HP 9000 Series 700/800 UX
     SCO 386/486 UNIX
     SGI IRIX
     AViiON DG-UX(88/OPEN)
   Prices start at $149.98
     Executables for the following additional platforms are
     available upon request for an additional $30.00 charge.
     BSD 386
     Ultrix MIPS DECstation 4.x
3. ViaCrypt PGP for WinCIM/CSNav.  A special package for users of
   CompuServe.  Prices start at $119.98

WHERE CAN I GET THE FREEWARE PGP?
These listings are subject to change without notice.  If you find that PGP has
been removed from any of these sites, please let me know so that I can update
this list.  Likewise, if you find PGP on a good site elsewhere (especially on
any BBS that allows first time callers to access PGP for free), please let me
know so that I can update this list.  Because this list changes frequently, I
have not attempted to keep it complete, but there should be enough pointers
to let you easily find PGP.
There are several ways to get the freeware PGP:  ftp, WWW, BBS, CompuServe,
email ftp server, and sneakernet (ask a friend for a copy).  Just don't ask
Philip Zimmermann directly for a copy.
FTP SITES IN NORTH AMERICA
There are some wierd hoops to jump through, thanks to the U. S. Department of
State and the ITAR, at many of these sites.
Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu, log in as getpgp, answer the questions, then ftp
to net-dist.mit.edu and change to the hidden directory named in the telnet
session to get your own copy.
MIT-PGP is for U. S. and Canadian use only, but MIT is only distributing it
within the USA (due to some archaic export control laws).
1.  Read ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/mitlicen.txt and agree to it.
2.  Read ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/rsalicen.txt and agree to it.
3.  Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu and log in as getpgp.
4.  Answer the questions and write down the directory name listed.
5.  QUICKLY end the telnet session with ^C and ftp to the indicated directory
    on net-dist.mit.edu (something like /pub/PGP/dist/U.S.-only-????) and get
    the distribution files (see the above chart for names).
    If the hidden directory name is invalid, start over at step 3, above.
You can also get PGP from:
    ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/pgp/
    See ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/README.MPJ for the ???????
    See ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/help for more help on negotiating this site's
    export control methods (open to USA and Canada).

    See ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/mp/mpj/help for more help on negotiating this
    site's export control methods.
    TO GET THESE FILES BY EMAIL, send mail to ftp-request at netcom.com
    containing the word HELP in the body of the message for instructions.
    You will have to work quickly to get README.MPJ then the files before
    the ??????? part of the path name changes again (several times a day).
    Follow the instructions found in README.Dist that you get from one of:
    ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/Net_info/Tools/Crypto/README.Dist

WORLD WIDE WEB ACCESS
                        The NCSA Forum sysops have a library (Library 12: Export Controlled) that is
available only to people who send them a message asserting that they are
within the U. S. A.  This library contains PGP.  I have also seen PGP in some
other places on Compuserve.  Try searching for PGP262.ZIP in the IBMFF forum
for up-to-date information on PGP in selected other areas.  The last time I
tried a search like this, PGP was found in the PC World Online forum (GO
PWOFORUM) new uploads area, along with several PGP shells and accessories.
I've also heard that EUROFORUM carries PGP, but have not confirmed this.
Compuserve file names are even more limited than DOS (6.3 instead of the
already lame 8.3), so the file names to look for are PGP262.ZIP, PG262S.ZIP
(source code), PGP262.GZ (Unix source code) and PG262D.ZIP (documentation

IS MY COPY OF PGP GOOD?
If you find a version of the PGP package that does not include the PGP User's
Guide, something is wrong.  The manual should always be included in the
package.  PGP should be signed by one of the developers (Philip Zimmermann,
Jeff Schiller, Viacrypt, Stale Schumacher, etc.).  If it isn't, the package
is suspect and should not be used or distributed.  The site you found it on
should remove it so that it does no further harm to others.  To be really
sure, you should get PGP directly from MIT or check the signatures with a
version of PGP that you trust.  The copies of PGP on ftp.csn.net/mpj,
ftp.netcom.com/pub/mp/mpj, and the Colorado Catacombs BBS are direct copies
of the ones on MIT, except that the ones on the BBS include a BBS
advertisement (automatically added by the system when it virus scans new
files) in the outer .zip files.

   PGP is rather counter-intuitive to a Mac user. Luckily, there's a
   guide to using MacPGP in

WHAT IS ALL THIS NONSENSE ABOUT EXPORT CONTROLS?
For a detailed rant, get ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/cryptusa.zip
The practical meaning, until the law is corrected to make sense, is that you
are requested to get PGP from sites outside of the USA and Canada if you are
outside of the USA and Canada.  If you are in France, I understand that you
aren't even supposed import it.  Other countries may be worse.  Make sure you
follow the laws of your own country.  If you want to officially export PGP,
you may be able to get permission in limited cases and for a fee.  Contact
the U. S. Department of State for information.
WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST IN THE USA?
MIT PGP is only for personal, noncommercial use because of restrictions on
the licensing of both the RSA algorithm (attached to RSAREF) and the IDEA
algorithm.  PKP/RSADSI insist that we use RSAREF instead of the mpi library
for reasons that make sense to them.
For commercial use, use Viacrypt PGP, which is fully licensed to use both the
RSA and IDEA algorithms in commercial and corporate environments (as well as
personal use, of course).
Another restriction is due to an exclusive marketing agreement between Philip
Zimmermann and Viacrypt that applies to the USA and Canada only.  Viacrypt
has exclusive rights to market PGP commercialy in this area of the world.
This means that if you want to market PGP commercially in competition with
Viacrypt in the USA or Canada, you would have to create a new implementation
of the functions of PGP containing none of Philip Zimmermann's copyrighted
code.  You are free to modify existing PGP code for your own use, as long as
you don't sell it.  Phil would also appreciate your checking with him before
you distribute any modified versions of PGP as freeware.
"PGP", "Pretty Good Privacy" and "Phil's Pretty Good Software" are trademarks
owned by Philip Zimmermann.  This means that if you modify an older version of
PGP that was issued under the copyleft license and distribute it without
Phil's permission, you have to call it something else.  This avoids confusing
all of us and protects Phil's good name.
WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST IN CANADA?
MIT PGP is only for noncommercial use because of restrictions on the
licensing of the IDEA algorithm.  Because the RSA algorithm isn't patented in
Canada, you are free to use the mpi library instead of RSAREF, if you want
to, thus freeing yourself of the RSAREF license associated with the RSAREF
copyright, which is valid in Canada.
For commercial use, use Viacrypt PGP, which is fully licensed to use the IDEA
algorithm in commercial and corporate environments.
The exclusive marketing agreement with Viacrypt also applies in Canada.  See
the section on USA intellectual property restrictions for more details.
WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA?
MIT PGP is only for noncommercial in areas where there is a patent on
software implementations of the IDEA algorithm.  Because the RSA algorithm
isn't patented outside of the USA, you are free to use the mpi library
instead of RSAREF, if you want to, thus freeing yourself of the RSAREF
license restrictions.  The RSAREF copyright holds outside of the USA, even
though the RSA patent does not.
The IDEA conventional block cipher is covered by US Patent 5,214,703 and
European patent EP 0 482 154 B1.  IDEA is a trademark of Ascom-Tech AG.
Commercial users of IDEA (including commercial use of PGP) may obtain
licensing details from Ph. Baumann, Ascom Tech Ltd., IDEA Lizenz, Postfach
151, CH-4502 Solothurn, Switzerland, Tel ++41 65 242828, Fax ++41 65 242847.
WHAT IS COMMERCIAL USE?
Use some common sense.  If you are running a business and using PGP to
protect credit card numbers sent to you electronically, then you are using
PGP commercially.  Your customers, however, need not buy the commercial
version of PGP just to buy something from you, if that is the only commercial
use they make of PGP (since they are spending, not making, money with PGP).
If you are just encrypting love letters or other personal mail (for which you
don't get paid) on your own personal computer, that is not commercial.  If
you are encrypting official business mail on your for-profit corporation's
computer with PGP, that is commercial use.
Note that there are some gray areas not covered above, and the patent owners
of RSA and IDEA may differ from my interpretation in the areas not covered
above, so if you are in doubt, you should consider the licensing of Viacrypt
PGP (or outside of North America, direct licensing of IDEA) to be cheap legal
insurance.  Indeed, the license fee is probably a lot cheaper than a legal
opinion from a lawyer qualified to make such a judgement.  Note that I am not
a lawyer and the above is not legal advise.  Use it at your own risk.
WHAT IS THE "TIME BOMB" IN MIT PGP 2.6?
There was a version byte change in MIT PGP 2.6 as of 1 September 1994.  See
ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/pgpbomb.asc for details.
ARE MY KEYS COMPATIBLE WITH THE OTHER PGP VERSIONS?
If your RSA key modulus length is less than or equal to 1024 bits (I don't
recommend less, unless you have a really slow computer and little patience),
and if your key was generated in the PKCS format, then it will work with any
of the current PGP versions (MIT PGP 2.6, PGP 2.6ui, or Viacrypt PGP 2.7). If
this is not the case, you really should generate a new key that qualifies.
MIT PGP 2.6.2 should be able to use 2048 bit keys.  Generation of 2048 bit
keys is supposed to automatically be enabled in PGP 2.6.2 in December, 1994.
By then, hopefully, most people will have had a chance to upgrade to a
version of PGP that can use them, so longer keys won't be a big problem.  On
the other hand, 1024 bit keys are probably beyond the reach of most criminals
and spies to break, anyway.

your key.  You could add it to some of your postings.  No matter which way you
do it, you should have your key signed by someone who verifies that your key
belongs to you, so that you don't have someone else generating a key that has
your name on it, but that isn't yours.

WHERE CAN I LEARN ABOUT PGP?
First, get a copy and read the instructions that come with it.  There are
also at least two books on PGP.  I've read the following and think it is
pretty good:
Protect Your Privacy: A Guide for PGP Users
William Stallings
Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-185596-4, $19.95, 300 pages
is available at most technical bookstores and many general bookstores
such as Barnes and Noble. If you order it from National Computer Security
Association (74774.1326 at compuserve.com) they will donate $1 of the price
to Phil Zimmermann's legal defense fund.
WHERE CAN I GET THE PGP VERSION DIRECTLY FROM PHILIP ZIMMERMANN?
This is the MIT version.  For several good reasons, Phil is releasing the
main line freeware PGP through MIT, at net-dist.mit.edu.  See a list of sites
that also carry this version, below, or use this WWW URL:
    WHAT IS PGP 2.6.i?
Stale Schumacher  released an international version of
PGP built the "right way."  By "right way," I mean that it uses the latest
MIT code, but uses a different rsaglue.c to use the mpilib instead of RSAREF
for RSA calculations, thus including all the latest bug fixes and features in
the main freeware PGP code line, but frees non-USA persons from the
limitations of the RSAREF license.  This release has been as strongly
endorsed by Philip Zimmermann as he can do without incriminating himself.
Naturally, by not using the RSAREF code for RSA calculations, this version is
not legal for use in the USA (other than limited research, etc.), but is fine
anywhere else (like Canada) were RSA patents don't hold.
Note that the latest version of Stale Schumacher's PGP is 2.6.i, 2.6i
(without the second .) was a beta test version that has been superceded.
WHAT IS PGP 2.6ui?
The "unofficial international" versions are really just PGP 2.3a, modified
just enough to make it compatible with MIT PGP 2.6, but do not include all of
the fixes in MIT PGP 2.6 and MIT PGP 2.6.1.  They have a "ui" somewhere in
their file names.  I recommend the use of the "ui" versions only if you are
using a platform for which there is no Viacrypt or MIT PGP that works
properly.  For a version that doesn't use RSAREF, PGP 2.6.i from Stale
Schumacher is a better choice, because it is more up-to-date.
WHERE CAN I GET VIACRYPT PGP?
If you are a commercial user of PGP in the USA or Canada, contact Viacrypt in
Phoenix, Arizona, USA.  The commecial version of PGP is fully licensed to use
the patented RSA and IDEA encryption algorithms in commercial and government
environments in the USA and Canada.  It is fully compatible with, functionally
the same as, and just as strong as the freeware version of PGP. Due to
limitations on ViaCrypt's RSA distribution license, ViaCrypt only distributes
executable code and documentation for it, but they are working on making PGP
available for a variety of platforms.  Call or write to them for the latest
information.  The latest version number for Viacrypt PGP is 2.7.
Here is a brief summary of Viacrypt's currently-available products:
1. ViaCrypt PGP for MS-DOS.  Prices start at $99.98
2. ViaCrypt PGP for UNIX.  Includes executables for the following
   platforms:
     SunOS 4.1.x (SPARC)
     IBM RS/6000 AIX
     HP 9000 Series 700/800 UX
     SCO 386/486 UNIX
     SGI IRIX
     AViiON DG-UX(88/OPEN)
   Prices start at $149.98
     Executables for the following additional platforms are
     available upon request for an additional $30.00 charge.
     BSD 386
     Ultrix MIPS DECstation 4.x
3. ViaCrypt PGP for WinCIM/CSNav.  A special package for users of
   CompuServe.  Prices start at $119.98

WHERE CAN I GET THE FREEWARE PGP?
These listings are subject to change without notice.  If you find that PGP has
been removed from any of these sites, please let me know so that I can update
this list.  Likewise, if you find PGP on a good site elsewhere (especially on
any BBS that allows first time callers to access PGP for free), please let me
know so that I can update this list.  Because this list changes frequently, I
have not attempted to keep it complete, but there should be enough pointers
to let you easily find PGP.
There are several ways to get the freeware PGP:  ftp, WWW, BBS, CompuServe,
email ftp server, and sneakernet (ask a friend for a copy).  Just don't ask
Philip Zimmermann directly for a copy.
FTP SITES IN NORTH AMERICA
There are some wierd hoops to jump through, thanks to the U. S. Department of
State, at many of these sites.  This is apparently because the U. S.
Department of State wants to make it easier for people outside of North
America to develop, distribute, use, or sell strong cryptographic software
than people inside of the USA and Canada -- at least that is the effect of
their rules.
Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu, log in as getpgp, answer the questions, then ftp
to net-dist.mit.edu and change to the hidden directory named in the telnet
session to get your own copy.
MIT-PGP is for U. S. and Canadian use only, but MIT is only distributing it
within the USA (due to some archaic export control laws).
1.  Read ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/mitlicen.txt and agree to it.
2.  Read ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/rsalicen.txt and agree to it.
3.  Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu and log in as getpgp.
4.  Answer the questions and write down the directory name listed.
5.  QUICKLY end the telnet session with ^C and ftp to the indicated directory
    on net-dist.mit.edu (something like /pub/PGP/dist/U.S.-only-????) and get
    the distribution files (see the above chart for names).
    If the hidden directory name is invalid, start over at step 3, above.
You can also get PGP from:
    See ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/README.MPJ
    See ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/mp/mpj/README.MPJ
    Follow the instructions found in README.Dist that you get from one of:

MACPGP OPTIONS
There are multiple parallel efforts to write an up-to-date MacPGP.  See the
following for the latest MacPGP beta stuff. Zbigniew Fiedorowicz
 has updated his MacPGP to support Apple
events, and his distribution comes with complete source code. Grady's netcom
directory contains a different version, about which he says "This latest bug
release beta 1.23 fixes several relatively minor bugs.  Source to this
version is NOT available, so its use should be restricted to experimentation
PGP FOR WINDOWS, WINDOWS NT, AND WINDOWS 95
There isn't one, yet, that I know of (at least not a true native Windows
application).  There are several good shells that call the DOS PGP for the
actual work, though.  I use Viacrypt's, but there are others available as
shareware or freeware at most of the sites listed above for PGP itself.
IS MY COPY OF PGP GOOD?
If you find a version of the PGP package that does not include the PGP User's
Guide, something is wrong.  The manual should always be included in the
package.  PGP should be signed by one of the developers (Philip Zimmermann,
Jeff Schiller, Viacrypt, Stale Schumacher, etc.).  If it isn't, the package
is suspect and should not be used or distributed.  The site you found it on
should remove it so that it does no further harm to others.  To be really
sure, you should get PGP directly from MIT or check the signatures with a
version of PGP that you trust.  The copies of PGP on ftp.csn.net/mpj,
ftp.netcom.com/pub/mp/mpj, and the Colorado Catacombs BBS are direct copies
of the ones on MIT, except that the ones on the BBS include a BBS
advertisement (automatically added by the system when it virus scans new
files) in the outer .zip files.

WHAT IS ALL THIS NONSENSE ABOUT EXPORT CONTROLS?
For a detailed rant, get ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/cryptusa.zip
The practical meaning, until the law is corrected to make sense, is that you
are requested to get PGP from sites outside of the USA and Canada if you are
outside of the USA and Canada.  If you are in France, I understand that you
aren't even supposed import it.  Other countries may be worse.  Make sure you
follow the laws of your own country.  If you want to officially export PGP,
you may be able to get permission in limited cases and for a fee.  Contact
the U. S. Department of State for information.
WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST IN THE USA?
MIT PGP is only for personal, noncommercial use because of restrictions on
the licensing of both the RSA algorithm (attached to RSAREF) and the IDEA
algorithm.  PKP/RSADSI insist that we use RSAREF instead of the mpi library
for reasons that make sense to them.
For commercial use, use Viacrypt PGP, which is fully licensed to use both the
RSA and IDEA algorithms in commercial and corporate environments (as well as
personal use, of course).
Another restriction is due to an exclusive marketing agreement between Philip
Zimmermann and Viacrypt that applies to the USA and Canada only.  Viacrypt
has exclusive rights to market PGP commercialy in this area of the world.
This means that if you want to market PGP commercially in competition with
Viacrypt in the USA or Canada, you would have to create a new implementation
of the functions of PGP containing none of Philip Zimmermann's copyrighted
code.  You are free to modify existing PGP code for your own use, as long as
you don't sell it.  Phil would also appreciate your checking with him before
you distribute any modified versions of PGP as freeware.
"PGP", "Pretty Good Privacy" and "Phil's Pretty Good Software" are trademarks
owned by Philip Zimmermann.  This means that if you modify an older version of
PGP that was issued under the copyleft license and distribute it without
Phil's permission, you have to call it something else.  This avoids confusing
all of us and protects Phil's good name.
WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST IN CANADA?
MIT PGP is only for noncommercial use because of restrictions on the
licensing of the IDEA algorithm.  Because the RSA algorithm isn't patented in
Canada, you are free to use the mpi library instead of RSAREF, if you want
to, thus freeing yourself of the RSAREF license associated with the RSAREF
copyright, which is valid in Canada.
For commercial use, use Viacrypt PGP, which is fully licensed to use the IDEA
algorithm in commercial and corporate environments.
The exclusive marketing agreement with Viacrypt also applies in Canada.  See
the section on USA intellectual property restrictions for more details.
WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA?
MIT PGP is only for noncommercial in areas where there is a patent on
software implementations of the IDEA algorithm.  Because the RSA algorithm
isn't patented outside of the USA, you are free to use the mpi library
instead of RSAREF, if you want to, thus freeing yourself of the RSAREF
license restrictions.  The RSAREF copyright holds outside of the USA, even
though the RSA patent does not.
The IDEA conventional block cipher is covered by US Patent 5,214,703 and
European patent EP 0 482 154 B1.  IDEA is a trademark of Ascom-Tech AG.
Commercial users of IDEA (including commercial use of PGP) may obtain
licensing details from Ph. Baumann, Ascom Tech Ltd., IDEA Lizenz, Postfach
151, CH-4502 Solothurn, Switzerland, Tel ++41 65 242828, Fax ++41 65 242847.
WHAT IS COMMERCIAL USE?
Use some common sense.  If you are running a business and using PGP to
protect credit card numbers sent to you electronically, then you are using
PGP commercially.  Your customers, however, need not buy the commercial
version of PGP just to buy something from you, if that is the only commercial
use they make of PGP (since they are spending, not making, money with PGP).
If you are just encrypting love letters or other personal mail (for which you
don't get paid) on your own personal computer, that is not commercial.  If
you are encrypting official business mail on your for-profit corporation's
computer with PGP, that is commercial use.
Note that there are some gray areas not covered above, and the patent owners
of RSA and IDEA may differ from my interpretation in the areas not covered
above, so if you are in doubt, you should consider the licensing of Viacrypt
PGP (or outside of North America, direct licensing of IDEA) to be cheap legal
insurance.  Indeed, the license fee is probably a lot cheaper than a legal
opinion from a lawyer qualified to make such a judgement.  Note that I am not
a lawyer and the above is not legal advise.  Use it at your own risk.
WHAT IS THE "TIME BOMB" IN MIT PGP 2.6?
There was a version byte change in MIT PGP 2.6 as of 1 September 1994.  See
ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/pgpbomb.asc for details.
ARE MY KEYS COMPATIBLE WITH THE OTHER PGP VERSIONS?
If your RSA key modulus length is less than or equal to 1024 bits (I don't
recommend less, unless you have a really slow computer and little patience),
and if your key was generated in the PKCS format, then it will work with any
of the current PGP versions (MIT PGP 2.6, PGP 2.6ui, or Viacrypt PGP 2.7). If
this is not the case, you really should generate a new key that qualifies.
MIT PGP 2.6.2 should be able to use 2048 bit keys.  Generation of 2048 bit
keys is supposed to automatically be enabled in PGP 2.6.2 in December, 1994.
By then, hopefully, most people will have had a chance to upgrade to a
version of PGP that can use them, so longer keys won't be a big problem.  On
the other hand, 1024 bit keys are probably beyond the reach of most criminals
and spies to break, anyway.

majordomo at c2.org with "subscribe pgp-public-keys" in the body of the message.
Another way is to upload it to the PGP public keys area of the Colorado
Catacombs BBS (303-772-1062).  Another way is to just send it to your
correspondents.  You could add it to your .plan file so that finger returns
your key.  You could add it to some of your postings.  No matter which way you
do it, you should have your key signed by someone who verifies that your key
belongs to you, so that you don't have someone else generating a key that has
your name on it, but that isn't yours.

WHAT IS THE LATEST VERSION?
There is more than one latest version.  Pick one or more of the following
that best suits your computer, patent restrictions, and export restrictions.
Some countries (like France) may also restrict import or even use of strong
cryptography like PGP.
Note:  there are other versions available, but these are either old, or
outside of the mainstream PGP project.  Look for new versions from one of
three sources:  Viacrypt (Commercial), MIT (North American freeware), or
mathew at mantis.co.uk (the unofficially non-designated holder of the unofficial
international version that parallels what Philip Zimmermann and the rest of
the PGP development team is doing in the USA.

WHERE CAN I GET VIACRYPT PGP?
Versions are available for DOS, Unix, or WinCIM/CSNav
Commercial software.  Call 800-536-2664 to order.
If you are a commercial user of PGP in the USA or Canada, contact Viacrypt in
Phoenix, Arizona, USA.  The commecial version of PGP is fully licensed to use
the patented RSA and IDEA encryption algorithms in commercial applications,
and may be used in corporate environments in the USA and Canada.  It is fully
compatible with, functionally the same as, and just as strong as the freeware
version of PGP. Due to limitations on ViaCrypt's RSA distribution license,
ViaCrypt only distributes executable code and documentation for it, but they
are working on making PGP available for a variety of platforms.  Call or
write to them for the latest information.  The latest version number for
their version of PGP is 2.7.
Upgrade from Viacrypt PGP 2.4 to 2.7 is free if you bought version 2.4 after
May 27, 1994, otherwise the upgrade is US$10.
Viacrypt's licensing and price information is as follows:

WHERE CAN I GET MIT PGP?
MIT PGP is Copyrighted freeware.
Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu, log in as getpgp, answer the questions, then ftp
to net-dist.mit.edu and change to the hidden directory named in the telnet
session to get your own copy.
MIT-PGP is for U. S. and Canadian use only, but MIT is only distributing it
within the USA (due to some archaic export control laws).
1.  Read ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/mitlicen.txt and agree to it.
2.  Read ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/rsalicen.txt and agree to it.
3.  Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu and log in as getpgp.
4.  Answer the questions and write down the directory name listed.
5.  QUICKLY end the telnet session with ^C and ftp to the indicated directory
    on net-dist.mit.edu (something like /pub/PGP/dist/U.S.-only-????) and get
    the distribution files (pgp26.zip, pgp26doc.zip, pgp26src.tar.gz,
    MacPGP2.6.sea.hqx, and MacPGP2.6.src.sea.hqx).
    If the hidden directory name is invalid, start over at step 3, above.
File names (shortened file names are for DOS BBS distribution):
pgp26doc.zip - documentation only
pgp26.zip    - includes DOS executable & documentation
pgp26src.zip - source code
pgp26src.tar or pgp26src.tar.gz - source code release for Unix and others
macpgp26.hqx or MacPGP2.6.sea.hqx - Macintosh executable & documentation
macpgp26.src or MacPGP2.6.src.sea.hqx - Macintosh source code
mcpgp268.hqx or MacPGP2.6-68000.sea.hqx - Macintosh executable for 68000
pgp26os2.zip - OS/2 executable (may not be on the MIT archive)
RSA and IDEA algorithms licenced for personal and noncommercial use.
Uses RSAREF, which may not be modified without RSADSI permission.
Contains "time bomb" to start generating messages incompatible with PGP 2.3
and 2.4 on 1 September 1994 as an incentive for people to not use PGP 2.3a in
the USA, which RSADSI claims infringes on their patents.  Mac versions are
not yet Applescriptable.  This version is not intended for export from the
USA and Canada due to the USA's International Traffic in Arms Regulations and
Canada's corresponding regulations.

    The NCSA Forum sysops have a library that is available only to people who
send them a message asserting that they are within the U. S. A.  This library
contains PGP.  I have also seen PGP 2.6 in some other places on Compuserve.
Try searching for PGP26.ZIP in the IBMFF forum for up-to-date information on
PGP in selected other areas.  The last time I tried a search like this, PGP
2.6 was found in the PC World Online forum (GO PWOFORUM) new uploads area,
along with several PGP shells and accessories.  I've also heard that
EUROFORUM caries PGP 2.6ui, but have not confirmed this.
Compuserve file names are even more limited than DOS, so the file names to
look for are PGP26.ZIP, PGP26S.ZIP (source code), and PGP26D.ZIP
(documentation only).

development and should appear very soon), and 2.3a3 for the Amiga.  The
latest amiga version is fully compatible with MIT's PGP 2.6.
Copyrighted freeware.
Version 2.6ui released by mathew at mantis.co.uk.
Amiga version 2.3a3 released by Peter Simons These versions do NOT use RSAREF.  No RSA patent problems outside the USA, but
this version is not legal for commercial or extensive personal use in the
USA.  IDEA licensed for presonal use only in countries where the IDEA patent
The freeware version of PGP is intended for noncommercial, experimental, and
scholarly use.  It is available on thousands of BBSes, commercial information
services, and Internet anonymous-ftp archive sites on the planet called
Earth.  This list cannot be comprehensive, but it should give you plenty of
pointers to places to find PGP.  Although the latest freeware version of PGP
was released from outside the USA (England), it is not supposed to be
exported from the USA under a strange law called the International Traffic in
Arms Regulations (ITAR).  Because of this, please get PGP from a site outside
the USA if you are outside of the USA and Canada.  Even though the RSAREF
license associated with PGP 2.6 from MIT no longer prohibits use outside the
USA, it still carries the not-for-profit restriction that the original RSA
code in PGP 2.6ui doesn't have.  On the other hand, patents on the IDEA
cipher may limit PGP use in your country to nonprofit applications, anyway.
Indeed, I understand that there are some countries where private electronic
mail is not legal, anyway.
These listings are subject to change without notice.  If you find that PGP has
been removed from any of these sites, please let me know so that I can update
this list.  Likewise, if you find PGP on a good site elsewhere (especially on
any BBS that allows first time callers to access PGP for free), please let me
know so that I can update this list.

If you find a version of the PGP package on a BBS or FTP site and it does not
include the PGP User's Guide, something is wrong.  The manual should always
be included in the package.  If it isn't, the package is suspect and should
not be used or distributed.  The site you found it on should remove it so
that it does no further harm to others.
ARCHIE WHO?
There are many more sites.  You can use archie and/or other "net-surfing"
tools to find a more up-to-date listing, if desired.

@_subject: Gore's "new and improved" key escrow proposal 
Good point.  The line between storage and transmission gets kind of fuzzy, however, if transmitted messages get stored in encrypted form.  I think that if I were designing an encryption system to be used for both in my own business, I would probably consider a compartmented escrow system for both kinds of messages, with a different escrow public key for each department.  That is would be a good balance between two evils:  unauthorized disclosure of proprietary communications, and loss of encrypted data due to loss of a key or loss of an employee.  Naturally, this would not be as convenient for law enforcement agents and spies, but I suppose that my own escrow data base would still be subject to the same subpoena process as the rest of my records, but I would be more likely to know when information was being leaked.

WHERE TO GET THE PRETTY GOOD PRIVACY PROGRAM (PGP)
(Last modified: 27 June 1994 by Mike Johnson)
WHAT IS THE LATEST VERSION?
There is more than one latest version.  Pick one or more of the following
that best suits your computer, patent restrictions, and export restrictions. Some countries (like France) may also restrict import or even use of strong
cryptography like PGP.
Note:  there are other versions available, but these are either old, or
outside of the mainstream PGP project.  Look for new versions from one of
three sources:  Viacrypt (Commercial), MIT (North American freeware), or
mathew at mantis.co.uk (the unofficially non-designated holder of the
unofficial international version that parallels what Philip Zimmermann and
the rest of the PGP development team is doing in the USA.
WHAT IS ALL THIS NONSENSE ABOUT EXPORT CONTROLS?
For a detailed rant, get ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/cryptusa.zip
The practical meaning, until the law is corrected to make sense, is that you
are requested to get PGP from sites outside of the USA and Canada if you are
outside of the USA and Canada.  If you are in France, I understand that you
aren't even supposed import it.  Other countries may be worse.
WHERE CAN I GET VIACRYPT PGP?
Versions are available for DOS, Unix, or WinCIM/CSNav
Commercial software.  Call 800-536-2664 to order.
If you are a commercial user of PGP in the USA or Canada, contact Viacrypt in
Phoenix, Arizona, USA.  The commecial version of PGP is fully licensed to use
the patented RSA and IDEA encryption algorithms in commercial applications,
and may be used in corporate environments in the USA and Canada.  It is fully
compatible with, functionally the same as, and just as strong as the freeware
version of PGP. Due to limitations on ViaCrypt's RSA distribution license,
ViaCrypt only distributes executable code and documentation for it, but they
are working on making PGP available for a variety of platforms.  Call or
write to them for the latest information.  The latest version number for
their version of PGP is 2.4.  Prices shown include release of version 2.7
if you buy your copy after May 27, 1994 (otherwise the upgrade will be about

WHERE CAN I GET MIT PGP?
MIT PGP is Copyrighted freeware.
Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu, log in as getpgp, answer the questions, then ftp
to net-dist.mit.edu and change to the hidden directory named in the telnet
session to get your own copy.
MIT-PGP is for U. S. and Canadian use only, but MIT is only distributing it
within the USA (due to some archaic export control laws). 1.  Read ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/mitlicen.txt and agree to it.
2.  Read ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/rsalicen.txt and agree to it.
3.  Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu and log in as getpgp.
4.  Answer the questions and write down the directory name listed.
5.  QUICKLY end the telnet session with ^C and ftp to the indicated directory
    on net-dist.mit.edu (something like /pub/PGP/dist/U.S.-only-????) and get
    the distribution files (pgp26.zip, pgp26doc.zip, pgp26src.tar.gz,
    MacPGP2.6.sea.hqx, and MacPGP2.6.src.sea.hqx).
    If the hidden directory name is invalid, start over at step 3, above.
File names (shortened file names are for DOS BBS distribution):
pgp26doc.zip - documentation only
pgp26.zip    - includes DOS executable & documentation
pgp26src.zip - source code
pgp26src.tar or pgp26src.tar.gz - source code release for Unix and others
macpgp26.hqx or MacPGP2.6.sea.hqx - Macintosh executable & documentation
macpgp26.src or MacPGP2.6.src.sea.hqx - Macintosh source code
mcpgp268.hqx or MacPGP2.6-68000.sea.hqx - Macintosh executable for 68000
pgp26os2.zip - OS/2 executable (may not be on the MIT archive)
RSA and IDEA algorithms licenced for personal and noncommercial use.
Uses RSAREF, which may not be modified without RSADSI permission.
Contains "time bomb" to start generating messages incompatible with PGP 2.3
and 2.4 on 1 September 1994 as an incentive for people to not use PGP 2.3a in
the USA, which RSADSI claims infringes on their patents.  Mac versions are
not yet Applescriptable.  This version is not intended for export from the
USA and Canada due to the USA's International Traffic in Arms Regulations and
Canada's corresponding regulations.

WHERE CAN I GET PGP FOR USE OUTSIDE OF THE USA?
The latest for outside the USA is the "Unofficial International" PGP 2.6 for
most platforms, MacPGP 2.3aV1.2 for the Mac (although 2.6ui is under
development and should appear very soon), and 2.3a3 for the Amiga.  The
latest amiga version is fully compatible with MIT's PGP 2.6.
Copyrighted freeware.  Version 2.6ui released by mathew at mantis.co.uk.
Amiga version 2.3a3 released by Peter Simons These versions do NOT use RSAREF.  No RSA patent problems outside the USA, but
this version is not legal for commercial or extensive personal use in the
USA.  IDEA licensed for presonal use only in countries where the IDEA patent
The freeware version of PGP is intended for noncommercial, experimental, and
scholarly use.  It is available on thousands of BBSes, commercial information
services, and Internet anonymous-ftp archive sites on the planet called
Earth.  This list cannot be comprehensive, but it should give you plenty of
pointers to places to find PGP.  Although the latest freeware version of PGP
was released from outside the USA (England), it is not supposed to be
exported from the USA under a strange law called the International Traffic in
Arms Regulations (ITAR).  Because of this, please get PGP from a site outside
the USA if you are outside of the USA and Canada.  Even though the RSAREF
license associated with PGP 2.6 from MIT no longer prohibits use outside the
USA, it still carries the not-for-profit restriction that the original RSA
code in PGP 2.6ui doesn't have.  On the other hand, patents on the IDEA
cipher may limit PGP use in your country to nonprofit applications, anyway. Indeed, I understand that there are some countries where private electronic
mail is not legal, anyway.
These listings are subject to change without notice.  If you find that PGP has
been removed from any of these sites, please let me know so that I can update
this list.  Likewise, if you find PGP on a good site elsewhere (especially on
any BBS that allows first time callers to access PGP for free), please let me
know so that I can update this list.

If you find a version of the PGP package on a BBS or FTP site and it does not
include the PGP User's Guide, something is wrong.  The manual should always
be included in the package.  If it isn't, the package is suspect and should
not be used or distributed.  The site you found it on should remove it so
that it does no further harm to others.
ARCHIE WHO?
There are many more sites.  You can use archie and/or other "net-surfing"
tools to find a more up-to-date listing, if desired.

WHERE TO GET THE PRETTY GOOD PRIVACY PROGRAM (PGP)
(Last modified: 2 May 1994 by Mike Johnson)
The latest commercial versions are 2.4 (both Viacrypt and BSAFE versions).
The latest freeware Mac version is 2.3 or 2.3a, depending on the variant.
The latest Amiga version is 2.3a2
The latest freeware version for all other platforms is 2.3a
If you are a commercial user of PGP in the USA or Canada, contact Viacrypt in
Phoenix, Arizona, USA.  The commecial version of PGP is fully licensed to use
the patented RSA and IDEA encryption algorithms in commercial applications,
and may be used in corporate environments in the USA and Canada.  It is fully
compatible with, functionally the same as, and just as strong as the freeware
version of PGP. Due to limitations on ViaCrypt's RSA distribution license,
ViaCrypt only distributes executable code and documentation for it, but they
are working on making PGP available for a variety of platforms.  Call or
write to them for the latest information.  The latest information I have from
them on compiled versions are:
    MS-DOS 2.4
    Unix 2.4 (several different platforms)
    WinCIM CSNAV 2.4
    Mac version expected late this summer.

PGP 2.3A has been posted to the FidoNet Software Distribution Network and
should on most if not all Canadian and U.S. nodes carrying SDN software.  It
has also been posted on almost all of the major private North American BBS
systems, thence to countless smaller boards.  Consult a list of your local
BBSes; most with a sizeable file inventory should carry the program.
If you find a version of the PGP package on a BBS or FTP site and it does not
include the PGP User's Guide, something is wrong.  The manual should always
be included in the package.  If it isn't, the package is suspect and should
not be used or distributed.  The site you found it on should remove it so
that it does no further harm to others.
Here is the result of an archie search for "pgp" on 4/27/94.  More sites
would show up if you performed a case-insensitive search for file names
containing "pgp", but such a search takes a long time, and is probably not
necessary.  Note that archie will not find some sites, like the one at
csn.org//mpj properly, due to the export control nonsense, but it does find
the directory where the PGP documentation is kept.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
WHERE TO GET THE PRETTY GOOD PRIVACY PROGRAM (PGP)
(Last modified: 3 May 1994 by Mike Johnson)
The latest commercial versions are 2.4 (both Viacrypt and BSAFE versions).
The latest freeware Mac version is 2.3 or 2.3aV1.1, depending on the variant.
The latest Amiga version is 2.3a2
The latest freeware version for all other platforms is 2.3a
If you are a commercial user of PGP in the USA or Canada, contact Viacrypt in
Phoenix, Arizona, USA.  The commecial version of PGP is fully licensed to use
the patented RSA and IDEA encryption algorithms in commercial applications,
and may be used in corporate environments in the USA and Canada.  It is fully
compatible with, functionally the same as, and just as strong as the freeware
version of PGP. Due to limitations on ViaCrypt's RSA distribution license,
ViaCrypt only distributes executable code and documentation for it, but they
are working on making PGP available for a variety of platforms.  Call or
write to them for the latest information.  The latest information I have from
them on compiled versions are:
    PGP 2.4 for MS-DOS
    PGP 2.4 for Unix (several different platforms)
    PGP 2.4 for WinCIM CSNAV
    Mac version expected late this summer.

The freeware version of PGP is intended for noncommercial, experimental, and
scholarly use.  It is available on thousands of BBSes, commercial information
services, and Internet anonymous-ftp archive sites on the planet called Earth.
This list cannot be comprehensive, but it should give you plenty of pointers
to places to find PGP.  Although the latest freeware version of PGP was
released from outside the USA (New Zealand), it is not supposed to be
exported from the USA under a strange law called the International Traffic in
Arms Regulations (ITAR).  Because of this, please get PGP from a site outside
the USA if you are outside of the USA.
This data is subject to change without notice.  If you find that PGP has been
removed from any of these sites, please let me know so that I can update this
list.  Likewise, if you find PGP on a good site elsewhere (especially on any
BBS that allows first time callers to access PGP for free), please let me
know so that I can update this list.  Thanks to Gary Edstrom and Hugh Miller
for providing part of this data.

@_subject: Where to get PGP 2.3, 2.3a, 2.4 and 2.5 
WHERE TO GET THE PRETTY GOOD PRIVACY PROGRAM (PGP)
(Last modified: 3 May 1994 by Mike Johnson)
The latest BETA TEST version for DOS and Unix is 2.5 (Uses RSAREF 2.0 for
    U. S. Patent compliance, even though the original RSA code written by
    Philip Zimmermann runs faster).
The latest commercial versions are 2.4 (both Viacrypt and BSAFE versions).
The latest freeware Mac version is 2.3 or 2.3aV1.1, depending on the variant.
    (Location of the source code for 2.3aV1.1 is a mystery to me).
The latest Amiga version is 2.3a2
The latest fully released freeware version for all other platforms is 2.3a
WHERE TO GET VIACRYPT PGP
If you are a commercial user of PGP in the USA or Canada, contact Viacrypt in
Phoenix, Arizona, USA.  The commecial version of PGP is fully licensed to use
the patented RSA and IDEA encryption algorithms in commercial applications,
and may be used in corporate environments in the USA and Canada.  It is fully
compatible with, functionally the same as, and just as strong as the freeware
version of PGP. Due to limitations on ViaCrypt's RSA distribution license,
ViaCrypt only distributes executable code and documentation for it, but they
are working on making PGP available for a variety of platforms.  Call or
write to them for the latest information.  The latest information I have from
them on compiled versions are:
    PGP 2.4 for MS-DOS
    PGP 2.4 for Unix (several different platforms)
    PGP 2.4 for WinCIM CSNAV
    Mac version expected late this summer.

WHERE TO GET THE BETA TEST PGP 2.5 FROM MIT (USES RSAREF 2.0)
MIT-PGP 2.5 is for U. S. use only (due to some archaic export control laws),
but interoperates with PGP 2.3 and 2.3a.
*** To Get PGP2.5: The directory where PGP2.5 is located is hidden.  To get
it you need to telnet to "net-dist.mit.edu" and login as getpgp.  You will be
asked to confirm that you will abide by the terms and conditions of the
3/16/94 RSAREF 2.0 license. The license is in the file "license.txt" in the
same directory as this file.  You will then be disconnected and you can ftp
the software from the indicated hidden directory.
You can also get PGP 2.5 from the Colorado Catacombs BBS (303-938-9654). Other BBS and ftp sites will no doubt pick it up rapidly after the beta test
is completed.
Please send bug reports to pgp-bugs at mit.edu.
If you obtain a copy of this beta release code, please keep checking
 for the announcement of the final release, so that
you can update your copy of PGP2.5.  We expect the final release to
occur within a week.
WHERE TO GET PGP 2.3a (RELEASED FROM NEW ZEALAND)
The freeware version of PGP is intended for noncommercial, experimental, and
scholarly use.  It is available on thousands of BBSes, commercial information
services, and Internet anonymous-ftp archive sites on the planet called Earth.
This list cannot be comprehensive, but it should give you plenty of pointers
to places to find PGP.  Although the latest freeware version of PGP was
released from outside the USA (New Zealand), it is not supposed to be
exported from the USA under a strange law called the International Traffic in
Arms Regulations (ITAR).  Because of this, please get PGP from a site outside
the USA if you are outside of the USA.
This data is subject to change without notice.  If you find that PGP has been
removed from any of these sites, please let me know so that I can update this
list.  Likewise, if you find PGP on a good site elsewhere (especially on any
BBS that allows first time callers to access PGP for free), please let me
know so that I can update this list.  Thanks to Gary Edstrom and Hugh Miller
for providing part of this data.

    This information From: jim.wenzel at grapevine.lrk.ar.us (Jim Wenzel)
PGP 2.3A has been posted to the FidoNet Software Distribution Network and
should on most if not all Canadian and U.S. nodes carrying SDN software.  It
has also been posted on almost all of the major private North American BBS
systems, thence to countless smaller boards.  Consult a list of your local
BBSes; most with a sizeable file inventory should carry the program.
If you find a version of the PGP package on a BBS or FTP site and it does not
include the PGP User's Guide, something is wrong.  The manual should always
be included in the package.  If it isn't, the package is suspect and should
not be used or distributed.  The site you found it on should remove it so
that it does no further harm to others.

Here is the result of an archie search for file names containing "pgp" (not
case sensitive) on 5/2/94.  The search was limited to 300 matches, because,
as you can plainly see, lots of people value their privacy.  Note that archie
will not find all relevant files at some sites, like the one at csn.org//mpj
properly, due to the export control nonsense, but it does find the directory
where the PGP documentation is kept.

WHERE TO GET THE PRETTY GOOD PRIVACY PROGRAM (PGP)
(Last modified: 12 May 1994 by Mike Johnson)
WHAT IS THE LATEST VERSION?
The latest BETA TEST version for DOS and Unix is 2.5 (Uses RSAREF 2.0 for
    U. S. Patent compliance, even though the original RSA code written by
    Philip Zimmermann runs faster).
The latest commercial versions are 2.4 (both Viacrypt and BSAFE versions).
The latest freeware Mac version for which source code is available is 2.3
The latest freeware Mac version (source code not public) is 2.3aV1.1
    (written by Christoph_Pagalies at hh2.maus.de)
The latest Amiga version is 2.3a2
The latest fully released freeware version for all other platforms is 2.3a
WHERE CAN I GET VIACRYPT PGP?
If you are a commercial user of PGP in the USA or Canada, contact Viacrypt in
Phoenix, Arizona, USA.  The commecial version of PGP is fully licensed to use
the patented RSA and IDEA encryption algorithms in commercial applications,
and may be used in corporate environments in the USA and Canada.  It is fully
compatible with, functionally the same as, and just as strong as the freeware
version of PGP. Due to limitations on ViaCrypt's RSA distribution license,
ViaCrypt only distributes executable code and documentation for it, but they
are working on making PGP available for a variety of platforms.  Call or
write to them for the latest information.  The latest information I have from
them on compiled versions are:
    PGP 2.4 for MS-DOS
    PGP 2.4 for Unix (several different platforms)
    PGP 2.4 for WinCIM CSNAV
    Mac version expected late this summer.

WHERE CAN I GET THE BETA TEST PGP 2.5 FROM MIT (USES RSAREF 2.0)?
MIT-PGP 2.5 is for U. S. use only (due to some archaic export control laws),
but interoperates with PGP 2.3 and 2.3a.  This is the right version to use if
you want to use it for personal (not for services you get paid for)
electronic mail privacy in the USA and Canada.  To get it from the source at
1.  Read ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/license.txt and agree to it.
2.  Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu and log in as getpgp.
3.  Answer the question and write down the directory name listed.
4.  QUICKLY end the telnet session with ^C and ftp to the indicated directory
    on net-dist.mit.edu (something like /pub/PGP/dist/U.S.-only-????) and get
    the distribution files (pgp25.zip, pgp25doc.zip, and pgp25src.tar).
    If the hidden directory name is invalid, start over at step 2, above.
You can also get PGP 2.5 from:
    ftp://csn.org/mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/pgp/pgp25.zip
    ftp://csn.org/mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/pgp/pgp25src.tar
    See ftp://csn.org/mpj/README.MPJ for the ???????
    See ftp://csn.org/mpj/help for more help on negotiating this site's
    export control methods.
    ftp://ftp.netcom.com/mpj//I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/pgp/pgp25.zip
    ftp://ftp.netcom.com/mpj//I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/pgp/pgp25src.tar
    See ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/mpj/README.MPJ for the ???????
    See ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/mpj/help for more help on negotiating this     site's export control methods.
    TO GET THESE FILES BY EMAIL, send mail to ftp-request at netcom.com
    containing the word HELP in the body of the message for instructions.      You will have to work quickly to get README.MPJ then the files before     the ??????? part of the path name changes again (several times a day).
    Follow the instructions found in README.Dist that you get from one of:
    ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/Net_info/Tools/Crypto/README.Dist

    Free access to PGP.  If busy or no answer, try again later.
    Log in with your own name, or if someone else already used that, try
    a variation on your name or pseudonym.  You can request access to     crypto software on line, and if you qualify legally under the ITAR,
    you can download on the first call.

    (303) 678-9939 (Longmont, Colorado number)
    Verified: This morning.
Other BBS and ftp sites will no doubt pick it up rapidly after the beta test
is completed.
Please send bug reports concerning PGP 2.5 BETA to pgp-bugs at mit.edu.
If you obtain a copy of this beta release code, please keep checking
 for the announcement of the final release, so that
you can update your copy of PGP2.5.
WHERE TO GET PGP 2.3a (RELEASED FROM NEW ZEALAND)
The freeware version of PGP is intended for noncommercial, experimental, and
scholarly use.  It is available on thousands of BBSes, commercial information
services, and Internet anonymous-ftp archive sites on the planet called Earth.
This list cannot be comprehensive, but it should give you plenty of pointers
to places to find PGP.  Although the latest freeware version of PGP was
released from outside the USA (New Zealand), it is not supposed to be
exported from the USA under a strange law called the International Traffic in
Arms Regulations (ITAR).  Because of this, please get PGP from a site outside
the USA if you are outside of the USA.
This data is subject to change without notice.  If you find that PGP has been
removed from any of these sites, please let me know so that I can update this
list.  Likewise, if you find PGP on a good site elsewhere (especially on any
BBS that allows first time callers to access PGP for free), please let me
know so that I can update this list.  Thanks to Gary Edstrom and Hugh Miller
for providing part of this data.

  MACPGP 2.3
   A slightly souped-up port of PGP to the Mac. Has help menus and other
   goodies, but is still not a real Mac application. However, it works.
   Note that the version 2.3 release of MacPGP contains the major bug-fix
   which was later added to UNIX/DOS PGP 2.3. There was therefore no need
   for a MacPGP 2.3A release; version 2.3 already had the bug fix by the
   time it was released. There is no MacPGP 2.3A.

    This information From: jim.wenzel at grapevine.lrk.ar.us (Jim Wenzel)
PGP 2.3A has been posted to the FidoNet Software Distribution Network and
should on most if not all Canadian and U.S. nodes carrying SDN software.  It
has also been posted on almost all of the major private North American BBS
systems, thence to countless smaller boards.  Consult a list of your local
BBSes; most with a sizeable file inventory should carry the program.
If you find a version of the PGP package on a BBS or FTP site and it does not
include the PGP User's Guide, something is wrong.  The manual should always
be included in the package.  If it isn't, the package is suspect and should
not be used or distributed.  The site you found it on should remove it so
that it does no further harm to others.
ARCHIE WHO?
Here is the result of an archie search for file names containing "pgp" (not
case sensitive) on 5/2/94.  The search was limited to 300 matches, because,
as you can plainly see, lots of people value their privacy.  Note that archie
will not find all relevant files at some sites, like the one at csn.org/mpj
properly, due to the export control nonsense, but it does find the directory
where the PGP documentation is kept.

WHERE CAN I GET THE PGP VERSION DIRECTLY FROM PHILIP ZIMMERMANN?
This is the MIT version.  For several good reasons, Phil is releasing the
main line freeware PGP through MIT, at net-dist.mit.edu.  See a list of sites
that also carry this version, below, or use this WWW URL:
    WHAT IS PGP 2.6.i?
Stale Schumacher  released an international version of
PGP built the "right way."  By "right way," I mean that it uses the latest
MIT code, but uses a different rsaglue.c to use the mpilib instead of RSAREF
for RSA calculations, thus including all the latest bug fixes and features in
the main freeware PGP code line, but frees non-USA persons from the
limitations of the RSAREF license.  This release has been as strongly
endorsed by Philip Zimmermann as he can do without incriminating himself.
Naturally, by not using the RSAREF code for RSA calculations, this version is
not legal for use in the USA (other than limited research, etc.), but is fine
anywhere else (like Canada) were RSA patents don't hold.
Note that the latest version of Stale Schumacher's PGP is 2.6.i, 2.6i
(without the second .) was a beta test version that has been superceded.
WHAT IS PGP 2.6ui?
The "unofficial international" versions are really just PGP 2.3a, modified
just enough to make it compatible with MIT PGP 2.6, but do not include all of
the fixes in MIT PGP 2.6 and MIT PGP 2.6.1.  They have a "ui" somewhere in
their file names.  I recommend the use of the "ui" versions only if you are
using a platform for which there is no Viacrypt or MIT PGP that works
properly.  For a version that doesn't use RSAREF, PGP 2.6.i from Stale
Schumacher is a better choice, because it is more up-to-date.
WHERE CAN I GET VIACRYPT PGP?
If you are a commercial user of PGP in the USA or Canada, contact Viacrypt in
Phoenix, Arizona, USA.  The commecial version of PGP is fully licensed to use
the patented RSA and IDEA encryption algorithms in commercial applications,
and may be used in corporate and government environments in the USA and
Canada.  It is fully compatible with, functionally the same as, and just as
strong as the freeware version of PGP. Due to limitations on ViaCrypt's RSA
distribution license, ViaCrypt only distributes executable code and
documentation for it, but they are working on making PGP available for a
variety of platforms.  Call or write to them for the latest information.  The
latest version number for Viacrypt PGP is 2.7.
Here is a brief summary of Viacrypt's currently-available products:
1. ViaCrypt PGP for MS-DOS.  Prices start at $99.98
2. ViaCrypt PGP for UNIX.  Includes executables for the following
   platforms:

     IBM RS/6000 AIX
     HP 9000 Series 700/800 UX
     SCO 386/486 UNIX
     SGI IRIX
     AViiON DG-UX(88/OPEN)
   Prices start at $149.98
     Executables for the following additional platforms are
     available upon request for an additional $30.00 charge.

WHERE CAN I GET THE FREEWARE PGP?
These listings are subject to change without notice.  If you find that PGP has
been removed from any of these sites, please let me know so that I can update
this list.  Likewise, if you find PGP on a good site elsewhere (especially on
any BBS that allows first time callers to access PGP for free), please let me
know so that I can update this list.  Because this list changes frequently, I
have not attempted to keep it complete, but there should be enough pointers
to let you easily find PGP.
There are several ways to get the freeware PGP:  ftp, WWW, BBS, CompuServe,
email ftp server, and sneakernet (ask a friend for a copy).  Just don't ask
Philip Zimmermann directly for a copy.
FTP SITES IN NORTH AMERICA
There are some wierd hoops to jump through, thanks to the U. S. Department of
State and the ITAR, at many of these sites.
Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu, log in as getpgp, answer the questions, then ftp
to net-dist.mit.edu and change to the hidden directory named in the telnet
session to get your own copy.
MIT-PGP is for U. S. and Canadian use only, but MIT is only distributing it
within the USA (due to some archaic export control laws).
1.  Read ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/mitlicen.txt and agree to it.
2.  Read ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/rsalicen.txt and agree to it.
3.  Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu and log in as getpgp.
4.  Answer the questions and write down the directory name listed.
5.  QUICKLY end the telnet session with ^C and ftp to the indicated directory
    on net-dist.mit.edu (something like /pub/PGP/dist/U.S.-only-????) and get
    the distribution files (see the above chart for names).
    If the hidden directory name is invalid, start over at step 3, above.
You can also get PGP from:
    ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/pgp/
    See ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/README.MPJ for the ???????
    See ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/help for more help on negotiating this site's
    export control methods (open to USA and Canada).
    ftp://ftp.netcom.com/mp/mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/pgp/
    See ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/mp/mpj/README.MPJ for the ???????
    See ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/mp/mpj/help for more help on negotiating this
    site's export control methods.
    TO GET THESE FILES BY EMAIL, send mail to ftp-request at netcom.com
    containing the word HELP in the body of the message for instructions.
    You will have to work quickly to get README.MPJ then the files before
    the ??????? part of the path name changes again (several times a day).
    Follow the instructions found in README.Dist that you get from one of:
    ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/Net_info/Tools/Crypto/README.Dist
    gopher.eff.org, 1/Net_info/Tools/Crypto
    gopher://gopher.eff.org/11/Net_info/Tools/Crypto
    ftp.csua.berkeley.edu (for U. S. or Canadian users)
    /pub/cypherpunks/pgp/
    /pub/crypto/software/dist/US_or_Canada_only_XXXXXXX/PGP
    (U. S. and Canadian users only)
    See /pub/crypto/software/README for the characters for XXXXXXXX
    This site has all public releases of the freeware PGP.
WORLD WIDE WEB ACCESS
                        The NCSA Forum sysops have a library (Library 12: Export Controlled) that is
available only to people who send them a message asserting that they are
within the U. S. A.  This library contains PGP.  I have also seen PGP in some
other places on Compuserve.  Try searching for PGP262.ZIP in the IBMFF forum
for up-to-date information on PGP in selected other areas.  The last time I
tried a search like this, PGP was found in the PC World Online forum (GO
PWOFORUM) new uploads area, along with several PGP shells and accessories.
I've also heard that EUROFORUM carries PGP, but have not confirmed this.
Compuserve file names are even more limited than DOS (6.3 instead of the
already lame 8.3), so the file names to look for are PGP262.ZIP, PG262S.ZIP
(source code), PGP262.GZ (Unix source code) and PG262D.ZIP (documentation

IS MY COPY OF PGP GOOD?
If you find a version of the PGP package that does not include the PGP User's
Guide, something is wrong.  The manual should always be included in the
package.  PGP should be signed by one of the developers (Philip Zimmermann,
Jeff Schiller, Viacrypt, Stale Schumacher, etc.).  If it isn't, the package
is suspect and should not be used or distributed.  The site you found it on
should remove it so that it does no further harm to others.  To be really
sure, you should get PGP directly from MIT or check the signatures with a
version of PGP that you trust.  The copies of PGP on ftp.csn.net/mpj,
ftp.netcom.com/pub/mp/mpj, and the Colorado Catacombs BBS are direct copies
of the ones on MIT, except that the ones on the BBS include a BBS
advertisement (automatically added by the system when it virus scans new
files) in the outer .zip files.
OTHER PGP DOCUMENTATION
   PGP is rather counter-intuitive to a Mac user. Luckily, there's a
   guide to using MacPGP in
   ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/qw/qwerty/Here.is.How.to.MacPGP.
   There is a Frequently Asked Questions document in
   ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/gb/gbe/pgpfaq.asc
   For more information on the "time bomb" in PGP, see
   ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/pgpbomb.asc
   More PGP details are at

WHAT IS ALL THIS NONSENSE ABOUT EXPORT CONTROLS?
For a detailed rant, get ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/cryptusa.zip
The practical meaning, until the law is corrected to make sense, is that you
are requested to get PGP from sites outside of the USA and Canada if you are
outside of the USA and Canada.  If you are in France, I understand that you
aren't even supposed import it.  Other countries may be worse.  Make sure you
follow the laws of your own country.  If you want to officially export PGP,
you may be able to get permission in limited cases and for a fee.  Contact
the U. S. Department of State for information.
WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST IN THE USA?
MIT PGP is only for personal, noncommercial use because of restrictions on
the licensing of both the RSA algorithm (attached to RSAREF) and the IDEA
algorithm.  PKP/RSADSI insist that we use RSAREF instead of the mpi library
for reasons that make sense to them.
For commercial use, use Viacrypt PGP, which is fully licensed to use both the
RSA and IDEA algorithms in commercial and corporate environments (as well as
personal use, of course).
Another restriction is due to an exclusive marketing agreement between Philip
Zimmermann and Viacrypt that applies to the USA and Canada only.  Viacrypt
has exclusive rights to market PGP commercialy in this area of the world.
This means that if you want to market PGP commercially in competition with
Viacrypt in the USA or Canada, you would have to create a new implementation
of the functions of PGP containing none of Philip Zimmermann's copyrighted
code.  You are free to modify existing PGP code for your own use, as long as
you don't sell it.  Phil would also appreciate your checking with him before
you distribute any modified versions of PGP as freeware.
"PGP", "Pretty Good Privacy" and "Phil's Pretty Good Software" are trademarks
owned by Philip Zimmermann.  This means that if you modify an older version of
PGP that was issued under the copyleft license and distribute it without
Phil's permission, you have to call it something else.  This avoids confusing
all of us and protects Phil's good name.
WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST IN CANADA?
MIT PGP is only for noncommercial use because of restrictions on the
licensing of the IDEA algorithm.  Because the RSA algorithm isn't patented in
Canada, you are free to use the mpi library instead of RSAREF, if you want
to, thus freeing yourself of the RSAREF license associated with the RSAREF
copyright, which is valid in Canada.
For commercial use, use Viacrypt PGP, which is fully licensed to use the IDEA
algorithm in commercial and corporate environments.
The exclusive marketing agreement with Viacrypt also applies in Canada.  See
the section on USA intellectual property restrictions for more details.
WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA?
MIT PGP is only for noncommercial in areas where there is a patent on
software implementations of the IDEA algorithm.  Because the RSA algorithm
isn't patented outside of the USA, you are free to use the mpi library
instead of RSAREF, if you want to, thus freeing yourself of the RSAREF
license restrictions.  The RSAREF copyright holds outside of the USA, even
though the RSA patent does not.
The IDEA conventional block cipher is covered by US Patent 5,214,703 and
European patent EP 0 482 154 B1.  IDEA is a trademark of Ascom-Tech AG.
Commercial users of IDEA (including commercial use of PGP) may obtain
licensing details from Ph. Baumann, Ascom Tech Ltd., IDEA Lizenz, Postfach
151, CH-4502 Solothurn, Switzerland, Tel ++41 65 242828, Fax ++41 65 242847.
WHAT IS COMMERCIAL USE?
Use some common sense.  If you are running a business and using PGP to
protect credit card numbers sent to you electronically, then you are using
PGP commercially.  Your customers, however, need not buy the commercial
version of PGP just to buy something from you, if that is the only commercial
use they make of PGP (since they are spending, not making, money with PGP).
If you are just encrypting love letters or other personal mail (for which you
don't get paid) on your own personal computer, that is not commercial.  If
you are encrypting official business mail on your for-profit corporation's
computer with PGP, that is commercial use.
Note that there are some gray areas not covered above, and the patent owners
of RSA and IDEA may differ from my interpretation in the areas not covered
above, so if you are in doubt, you should consider the licensing of Viacrypt
PGP (or outside of North America, direct licensing of IDEA) to be cheap legal
insurance.  Indeed, the license fee is probably a lot cheaper than a legal
opinion from a lawyer qualified to make such a judgement.  Note that I am not
a lawyer and the above is not legal advise.  Use it at your own risk.
WHAT IS THE "TIME BOMB" IN MIT PGP 2.6?
There was a version byte change in MIT PGP 2.6 as of 1 September 1994.  See
ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/pgpbomb.asc for details.
ARE MY KEYS COMPATIBLE WITH THE OTHER PGP VERSIONS?
If your RSA key modulus length is less than or equal to 1024 bits (I don't
recommend less, unless you have a really slow computer and little patience),
and if your key was generated in the PKCS format, then it will work with any
of the current PGP versions (MIT PGP 2.6, PGP 2.6ui, or Viacrypt PGP 2.7). If
this is not the case, you really should generate a new key that qualifies.
MIT PGP 2.6.2 should be able to use 2048 bit keys.  Generation of 2048 bit
keys is supposed to automatically be enabled in PGP 2.6.2 in December, 1994.
By then, hopefully, most people will have had a chance to upgrade to a
version of PGP that can use them, so longer keys won't be a big problem.  On
the other hand, 1024 bit keys are probably beyond the reach of most criminals
and spies to break, anyway.

your key.  You could add it to some of your postings.  No matter which way you
do it, you should have your key signed by someone who verifies that your key
belongs to you, so that you don't have someone else generating a key that has
your name on it, but that isn't yours.

WHERE CAN I GET VIACRYPT PGP?
If you are a commercial user of PGP in the USA or Canada, contact Viacrypt in
Phoenix, Arizona, USA.  The commecial version of PGP is fully licensed to use
the patented RSA and IDEA encryption algorithms in commercial applications,
and may be used in corporate and government environments in the USA and
Canada.  It is fully compatible with, functionally the same as, and just as
strong as the freeware version of PGP.
Orders may be placed by calling 800-536-2664 during the hours of 8:30am to
5:00pm MST, Monday - Friday.  They accept VISA, MasterCard, AMEX and Discover
credit cards.
If you have further questions, please feel free to contact viacrypt at acm.org.
WHERE CAN I GET THE FREEWARE PGP?
There are several ways to get the freeware PGP:  ftp, WWW, BBS, CompuServe,
email ftp server, and sneakernet (ask a friend for a copy).  Just don't ask
Philip Zimmermann directly for a copy.
FTP SITES IN NORTH AMERICA
Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu, log in as getpgp, answer the questions, then ftp
to net-dist.mit.edu and change to the hidden directory named in the telnet
session to get your own copy.
MIT-PGP is for U. S. and Canadian use only, but MIT is only distributing it
within the USA (due to some archaic export control laws).
1.  Read ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/mitlicen.txt and agree to it.
2.  Read ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/rsalicen.txt and agree to it.
3.  Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu and log in as getpgp.
4.  Answer the questions and write down the directory name listed.
5.  QUICKLY end the telnet session with ^C and ftp to the indicated directory
    on net-dist.mit.edu (something like /pub/PGP/dist/U.S.-only-????) and get
    the distribution files (see the above chart for names).
    If the hidden directory name is invalid, start over at step 3, above.

WHAT IS ALL THIS NONSENSE ABOUT EXPORT CONTROLS?
The U. S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations claim to prohibit export
of PGP from the USA without a license, except to Canada.  Canada has similar
rules.  Therefore, if you are outside of North America, please get your copy
of PGP from a site outside of North America.
WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST IN THE USA?
MIT PGP is only for personal, noncommercial use because of restrictions on
the licensing of both the RSA algorithm (attached to RSAREF) and the IDEA
algorithm.  PKP/RSADSI insist that we use RSAREF instead of the mpi library
for reasons that make sense to them.
For commercial use, use Viacrypt PGP, which is fully licensed to use both the
RSA and IDEA algorithms in commercial and corporate environments (as well as
personal use, of course).
Another restriction is due to an exclusive marketing agreement between Philip
Zimmermann and Viacrypt that applies to the USA and Canada only.  Viacrypt
has exclusive rights to market PGP commercialy in this area of the world.
This means that if you want to market PGP commercially in competition with
Viacrypt in the USA or Canada, you would have to create a new implementation
of the functions of PGP containing none of Philip Zimmermann's copyrighted
code.  You are free to modify existing PGP code for your own use, as long as
you don't sell it.  Phil would also appreciate your checking with him before
you distribute any modified versions of PGP as freeware.
"PGP", "Pretty Good Privacy" and "Phil's Pretty Good Software" are trademarks
owned by Philip Zimmermann.  This means that if you modify an older version of
PGP that was issued under the copyleft license and distribute it without
Phil's permission, you have to call it something else.  This avoids confusing
all of us and protects Phil's good name.
WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST IN CANADA?
MIT PGP is only for noncommercial use because of restrictions on the
licensing of the IDEA algorithm.  Because the RSA algorithm isn't patented in
Canada, you are free to use the mpi library instead of RSAREF, if you want
to, thus freeing yourself of the RSAREF license associated with the RSAREF
copyright, which is valid in Canada.
For commercial use, use Viacrypt PGP, which is fully licensed to use the IDEA
algorithm in commercial and corporate environments.
The exclusive marketing agreement with Viacrypt also applies in Canada.  See
the section on USA intellectual property restrictions for more details.
WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA?
MIT PGP is only for noncommercial in areas where there is a patent on
software implementations of the IDEA algorithm.  Because the RSA algorithm
isn't patented outside of the USA, you are free to use the mpi library
instead of RSAREF, if you want to, thus freeing yourself of the RSAREF
license restrictions.  The RSAREF copyright holds outside of the USA, even
though the RSA patent does not.
The IDEA conventional block cipher is covered by US Patent 5,214,703 and
European patent EP 0 482 154 B1.  IDEA is a trademark of Ascom-Tech AG.
Commercial users of IDEA (including commercial use of PGP) may obtain
licensing details from Ph. Baumann, Ascom Tech Ltd., IDEA Lizenz, Postfach
151, CH-4502 Solothurn, Switzerland, Tel ++41 65 242828, Fax ++41 65 242847.
WHAT IS COMMERCIAL USE?
Use some common sense.  If you are running a business and using PGP to
protect credit card numbers sent to you electronically, then you are using
PGP commercially.  Your customers, however, need not buy the commercial
version of PGP just to buy something from you, if that is the only commercial
use they make of PGP (since they are spending, not making, money with PGP).

WHERE TO GET THE PRETTY GOOD PRIVACY PROGRAM (PGP)
(Last modified: 7 September 1994 by Mike Johnson)
WHAT IS THE LATEST VERSION?
There is more than one latest version.  Pick one or more of the following
that best suits your computer, patent restrictions, and export restrictions.
Some countries (like France) may also restrict import or even use of strong
cryptography like PGP.
Note:  there are other versions available, but these are either old, or
outside of the mainstream PGP project.  Look for signatures from one of three
sources:  Viacrypt (Commercial), jis at mit.edu (North American freeware), or
mathew at mantis.co.uk (the unofficial international version source).  The
"unofficial international" versions are really just PGP 2.3a, modified just
enough to make it compatible with MIT PGP 2.6, but do not include all of the
fixes in MIT PGP 2.6 and MIT PGP 2.6.1.  They are named pgp26ui* or have a
"ui" somewhere in their file names.  I recommend the use of the "ui" versions
only if:
        (1) You are using a Macintosh;
        (2) You are using a platform for which there is no Viacrypt or MIT
            PGP;
        (3) You are outside of North America, and can't obtain Viacrypt or
            MIT PGP; or
        (4) You need to use a key longer than 1024 bits (i. e. a 1264 bit
            key generated with PGP 2.3a or PGP 2.6ui).
WHERE CAN I GET VIACRYPT PGP?
If you are a commercial user of PGP in the USA or Canada, contact Viacrypt in
Phoenix, Arizona, USA.  The commecial version of PGP is fully licensed to use
the patented RSA and IDEA encryption algorithms in commercial applications,
and may be used in corporate environments in the USA and Canada.  It is fully
compatible with, functionally the same as, and just as strong as the freeware
version of PGP. Due to limitations on ViaCrypt's RSA distribution license,
ViaCrypt only distributes executable code and documentation for it, but they
are working on making PGP available for a variety of platforms.  Call or
write to them for the latest information.  The latest version number for
their version of PGP is 2.7.
The Windows version is anticipated to ship by (or before) September 15, 1994;
the Macintosh version is expected to ship in early October.  The formal
announcements will go out about one week prior to first ship dates.  The
Windows version is a high grade Visual Basic front end with the DOS program
in the back end. It is a point-and-click, drag-and-drop operation.
Here is a brief summary of Viacrypt's currently-available products:
1. ViaCrypt PGP for MS-DOS.  Prices start at $99.98
2. ViaCrypt PGP for UNIX.  Includes executables for the following
   platforms:
     SunOS 4.1.x (SPARC)

WHERE CAN I GET THE FREEWARE PGP?
These listings are subject to change without notice.  If you find that PGP has
been removed from any of these sites, please let me know so that I can update
this list.  Likewise, if you find PGP on a good site elsewhere (especially on
any BBS that allows first time callers to access PGP for free), please let me
know so that I can update this list.  Because this list changes frequently, I
have not attempted to keep it complete, but there should be enough pointers
to let you easily find PGP.
There are several ways to get the freeware PGP:  ftp, WWW, BBS, CompuServe,
America Online (maybe), email ftp server, and sneakernet (ask a friend for a
copy).  Just don't ask the author directly for a copy.
FTP SITES IN NORTH AMERICA
These sites generally have some mechanism to (1) discourage export of PGP and
violation of the ITAR, (2) protect the site operators from harrassment by the
Federal Government, and (3) still allow automated distribution of PGP as far
as is allowed under all applicable laws.
Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu, log in as getpgp, answer the questions, then ftp
to net-dist.mit.edu and change to the hidden directory named in the telnet
session to get your own copy.
MIT-PGP is for U. S. and Canadian use only, but MIT is only distributing it
within the USA (due to some archaic export control laws).
1.  Read ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/mitlicen.txt and agree to it.
2.  Read ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/rsalicen.txt and agree to it.
3.  Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu and log in as getpgp.
4.  Answer the questions and write down the directory name listed.
5.  QUICKLY end the telnet session with ^C and ftp to the indicated directory
    on net-dist.mit.edu (something like /pub/PGP/dist/U.S.-only-????) and get
    the distribution files (see the above chart for names).
    If the hidden directory name is invalid, start over at step 3, above.
You can also get PGP from:
    ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/pgp/
    See ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/README.MPJ for the ???????
    See ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/help for more help on negotiating this site's
    export control methods (open to USA and Canada).

    See ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/mpj/help for more help on negotiating this
    site's export control methods.
    TO GET THESE FILES BY EMAIL, send mail to ftp-request at netcom.com
    containing the word HELP in the body of the message for instructions.
    You will have to work quickly to get README.MPJ then the files before
    the ??????? part of the path name changes again (several times a day).
    Follow the instructions found in README.Dist that you get from one of:
    ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/Net_info/Tools/Crypto/README.Dist
    gopher.eff.org, 1/Net_info/Tools/Crypto

    See /pub/crypto/software/README for the characters for XXXXXXXX
    This site has all public releases of the freeware PGP.
WORLD WIDE WEB ACCESS
        The NCSA Forum sysops have a library (Library 12: Export Controlled) that is
available only to people who send them a message asserting that they are
within the U. S. A.  This library contains PGP.  I have also seen PGP in some
other places on Compuserve.  Try searching for PGP261.ZIP in the IBMFF forum
for up-to-date information on PGP in selected other areas.  The last time I
tried a search like this, PGP 2.6 was found in the PC World Online forum (GO
PWOFORUM) new uploads area, along with several PGP shells and accessories.
I've also heard that EUROFORUM caries PGP 2.6ui, but have not confirmed this.
Compuserve file names are even more limited than DOS (6.3 instead of the
already lame 8.3), so the file names to look for are PGP26.ZIP, PG261S.ZIP
(source code), PGP261.GZ (Unix source code) and PG261D.ZIP (documentation

IS MY COPY OF PGP GOOD?
If you find a version of the PGP package that does not include the PGP User's
Guide, something is wrong.  The manual should always be included in the
package.  PGP should be signed by one of the developers (Philip Zimmermann,
Jeff Schiller, Viacrypt, etc.).  If it isn't, the package is suspect and
should not be used or distributed.  The site you found it on should remove it
so that it does no further harm to others.  To be really sure, you should get
PGP directly from MIT or check the signatures with a version of PGP that you
trust.  The copies of PGP on ftp.csn.net/mpj, ftp.netcom.com/pub/mpj, and the
Colorado Catacombs BBS are direct copies of the ones on MIT, except that the
ones on the BBS include a BBS advertisement (automatically added by the
system when it virus scans new files) in the outer .zip files.

ARCHIE WHO?
There are many more sites.  You can use archie and/or other "net-surfing"
tools to find a more up-to-date listing, if desired.
WHAT IS ALL THIS NONSENSE ABOUT EXPORT CONTROLS?
For a detailed rant, get ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/cryptusa.zip
The practical meaning, until the law is corrected to make sense, is that you
are requested to get PGP from sites outside of the USA and Canada if you are
outside of the USA and Canada.  If you are in France, I understand that you
aren't even supposed import it.  Other countries may be worse.
It is illegal to export PGP from the USA to any country except Canada, even
if that version of PGP originated outside of the USA.  Don't do it.  Don't
ask me to do it.  The law is not rational, but it exists, and the Federal
Government has no sense of humor.  On the other hand, if you should discover
a copy of PGP in some place other than the USA, then you are bound by the
laws of both that country and your own country with respect to what you can
do with it, not necessarily by U. S. Law.  Your laws may be more or less
restrictive, and may possibly refer to U. S. Law through some sort of treaty.
If you live in a place where you can freely distribute and use PGP, then I
applaud your government.
In spite of the best efforts of MIT and the other primary developers and
distributors of PGP not to violate the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations, MIT PGP has been observed to migrate to many foreign sites.
Whoever is responsible for this export is responsible for their own actions
and is not encouraged or endorsed by myself, Philip Zimmermann, or MIT.  This
doesn't necessarily mean that we agree with the law, or even that the law
itself is Constitutional.  It just means that becoming a test case is not
WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST IN THE USA?
MIT PGP is only for noncommercial use because of restrictions on the
licensing of both the RSA algorithm (attached to RSAREF) and the IDEA
algorithm.  PKP/RSADSI insist that we use RSAREF instead of the mpi library
for reasons that make sense to them.
For commercial use, use Viacrypt PGP, which is fully licensed to use both the
RSA and IDEA algorithms in commercial and corporate environments.
WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST IN CANADA?
MIT PGP is only for noncommercial use because of restrictions on the
licensing of the IDEA algorithm.  Because the RSA algorithm isn't patented in
Canada, you are free to use the mpi library instead of RSAREF, if you want
to, thus freeing yourself of the RSAREF license.
For commercial use, use Viacrypt PGP, which is fully licensed to use the IDEA
algorithm in commercial and corporate environments.
WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA?
MIT PGP is only for noncommercial in areas where there is a patent on
software implementations of the IDEA algorithm.  Because the RSA algorithm
isn't patented outside of the USA, you are free to use the mpi library
instead of RSAREF, if you want to, thus freeing yourself of the RSAREF
For commercial use, you cannot buy Viacrypt PGP, but you can arrange to
license your use of IDEA directly from ETH Zurich.  If software
implementations of IDEA are not covered by a patent in your country, then you
can use the freeware versions of PGP, provided that you compile it with the
mpi library instead of RSAREF.
WHAT IS THE "TIME BOMB" IN MIT PGP 2.6?
As a concession to the RSA patent holders (in return for endorsement of the
legality of the freeware MIT PGP 2.6), MIT placed an inducement in MIT PGP
2.6 to encourage upgrade from the alledgedly patent-infringing PGP 2.3a to
the MIT version.  The nature of this inducement is a change in a packet ID
byte that causes PGP 2.3a and earlier to reject messages created by MIT PGP
2.6 after 1 September 1994.  Altering MIT PGP 2.6 to bypass this annoyance
(though technically an easy change to the LEGAL_KLUDGE), invalidates the
blessing of Public Key Partners on the licence of MIT PGP 2.6.  Therefore, it
is a bad idea.  On the other hand, it is trivial to hack PGP 2.3a to accept
these packets, and that (plus a few other bug fixes) is essentially what PGP
2.6ui is.  None of the versions of PGP greater than 2.3 have problems reading
the old packet ID values, so for maximum compatibility, the ideal is to write
the old value and accept either value.
Unfortunately, this time bomb has a negative effect on Viacrypt PGP 2.4, as
well, which never infringed on anyone's patents.  Viacrypt's solution was to
issue PGP 2.7, which, by default acts just like MIT PGP 2.6, but has a
config.txt option (explained in the release) that allows compatibility with
both PGP 2.4 and PGP 2.6.  Naturally, this also allows compatibility with PGP
The time bomb is annoying for those who still wish to use PGP 2.3a, and for
those who use Viacrypt PGP 2.4 and don't want to spend US$10 to upgrade to
Viacrypt PGP 2.7, but considering the magnitude of the concession made by
Public Key Partners in legitimizing the freeware PGP for use in the USA, it
was worth it.
For more information on the time bomb, see ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/pgpbomb.asc
ARE MY KEYS COMPATIBLE WITH THE OTHER PGP VERSIONS?
If your RSA key modulus length is less than or equal to 1024 bits (I don't
recommend less, unless you have a really slow computer and little patience),
and if your key was generated in the PKCS format, then it will work with any
of the current PGP versions (MIT PGP 2.6, PGP 2.6ui, or Viacrypt PGP 2.7). If
this is not the case, you really should generate a new key that qualifies.
Philip Zimmermann is aware of the desire for longer keys in PGP by some PGP
fans (like me), but wants to migrate towards that goal in an orderly way, by
first releasing versions of PGP in for all platforms and for both commercial
(Viacrypt) and freeware (MIT) flavors that ACCEPT long keys, then releasing
versions that can also GENERATE long keys.  He also has some other neat key
management ideas that he plans to implement in future versions.
These are the most annoying:
MIT PGP 2.6 -- the function xorbytes doesn't.  Replace the = with ^= to fix
               it.  The effect of this bug is that RSA keys aren't quite as
               random as they should be -- probably not a practical problem,
               but worth fixing if you are going to compile the code
               yourself.  Fixed in 2.6.1.
MIT PGP 2.6 -- DON'T SET PGPPASS when editing your keys, because if you do,
               and if you don't change your pass phrase, the key is lost.
               (If this happens, rename your backup keyring files to the
               primary files before you do anything else).  Fixed in 2.6.1.
PGP 2.6ui --   Conventional encryption -c option doesn't use a different IV
               every time, like it is supposed to.  (PGP 2.3a had this
               problem, too).  Fixed in 2.6 and 2.6.1.
HOW DO I PUBLISH MY PGP PUBLIC KEY?
There are lots of ways.  One way is to use a key server.  Send mail to one of
these addresses with the single word "help" in the subject line to find out
how to use a key server.
        pgp-public-keys at pgp.iastate.edu

        pgp-public-keys at fbihh.informatik.uni-hamburg.de
        There is also an experimental public key server at
        Another way is to upload it to the PGP public keys area of the Colorado
Catacombs BBS (303-772-1062).  Another way is to just send it to your
correspondents.  You could add it to your .plan file so that finger returns
your key.  You could add it to some of your postings.  No matter which way you
do it, you should have your key signed by someone who verifies that your key
belongs to you, so that you don't have someone else generating a key that has
your name on it, but that isn't yours.

The Ruby Block Cipher has just been published.  It is not a general block
cipher in that it cannot be used in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode.  It is
more like a cryptographic hash function with a block size of only 64 bits. Of
course, 64 bits is too short for a cryptographic hash function intended for
digital signature use, but it is just fine for a quick block cipher.

something better than common weak encryption methods in use in the software

@_subject: Weak keys in Diamond Encryption Algorithm fixed. 
There is a class of weak keys in the Diamond Encryption Algorithm.  These are
the ones that result in all of the individual substitution arrays being the
same.  This has a probability of about 2^-40 of happening, and is not the
basis of a practical attack, but it is interesting, anyway.  Thanks to
Colin Plumb for pointing this out. This weakness has been eliminated in the Diamond2 Encryption Algorithm.
See ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/public/diamond2.ps.gz for details.  If you are in
the USA or Canada, there is a reference implementation (as well as the above
document) in
where the ??????? is revealed in ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/README along with
an export warning.
I've also put an updated description of another algorithm, the Sapphire II
Stream Cipher, in ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/public/sapphire.ps.gz and a reference
implementation in
DLOCK2.ZIP and SAPPHIRE.ZIP are also on the Colorado Catacombs BBS at
You are invited to review the above algorithms and let me know if you find
any weakness in them.
These are not commercial products, and this is not an advertisement.  This
is an electronic publication for the enjoyment of people who are interested
in cryptography for constructive purposes.

Prentice Hall PTR             O'Reilly & Associates, Inc.
ISBN 0-13-185596-4            ISBN 1-56592-098-8

If you order Stallings' book from National Computer Security Association
(74774.1326 at compuserve.com) they will donate $1 of the price to Phil
Zimmermann's legal defense fund.
WHERE CAN I GET THE PGP VERSION DIRECTLY FROM PHILIP ZIMMERMANN?
Get the MIT version.  See  WHAT IS PGP 2.6.i?
Stale Schumacher  released an international version of
PGP built the "right way."  By "right way," I mean that it uses the latest
MIT code, but uses a different rsaglue.c to use the mpilib instead of RSAREF
for RSA calculations, thus including all the latest bug fixes and features in
the main freeware PGP code line, but frees non-USA persons from the
limitations of the RSAREF license.  This release has been as strongly
endorsed by Philip Zimmermann as he can do without incriminating himself.
Naturally, by not using the RSAREF code for RSA calculations, this version is
not legal for use in the USA (other than limited research, etc.), but is fine
anywhere else (like Canada) were RSA patents don't hold.
Note that the latest version of Stale Schumacher's PGP is 2.6.i, 2.6i
(without the second .) was a beta test version that has been superceded.
WHAT IS PGP 2.6ui?
The "unofficial international" versions are really just PGP 2.3a, modified
just enough to make it compatible with MIT PGP 2.6, but do not include all of
the fixes in MIT PGP 2.6 and MIT PGP 2.6.1.  They have a "ui" somewhere in
their file names.
WHERE CAN I GET VIACRYPT PGP?
Contact Viacrypt in Phoenix, Arizona, USA.  The commecial version of PGP is
fully licensed to use the patented RSA and IDEA encryption algorithms in
commercial and government environments in the USA and Canada.  It is fully
compatible with, functionally the same as, and just as strong as the freeware
version of PGP. Due to limitations on ViaCrypt's RSA distribution license,
ViaCrypt only distributes executable code and documentation for it, but they
are working on making PGP available for a variety of platforms.  Call or
write to them for the latest information.  The latest version number for
Viacrypt PGP is 2.7.
Here is a brief summary of Viacrypt's currently-available products:
1. ViaCrypt PGP for MS-DOS.  Prices start at $99.98
2. ViaCrypt PGP for UNIX.  Includes executables for the following
   platforms:
     SunOS 4.1.x (SPARC)
     IBM RS/6000 AIX
     HP 9000 Series 700/800 UX
     SCO 386/486 UNIX

WHERE CAN I GET THE FREEWARE PGP?
These listings are subject to change without notice.  If you find that PGP has
been removed from any of these sites, please let me know so that I can update
this list.  Likewise, if you find PGP on a good site elsewhere (especially on
any BBS that allows first time callers to access PGP for free), please let me
know so that I can update this list.  Because this list changes frequently, I
have not attempted to keep it complete, but there should be enough pointers
to let you easily find PGP.
There are several ways to get the freeware PGP:  ftp, WWW, BBS, CompuServe,
email ftp server, and sneakernet (ask a friend for a copy).  Just don't ask
Philip Zimmermann directly for a copy.
FTP SITES IN NORTH AMERICA
There are some wierd hoops to jump through, thanks to the U. S. Department of
State, at many of these sites.  This is apparently because the U. S.
Department of State wants to make it easier for people outside of North
America to develop, distribute, use, or sell strong cryptographic software
than people inside of the USA and Canada -- at least that is the effect of
their rules.
Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu, log in as getpgp, answer the questions, then ftp
to net-dist.mit.edu and change to the hidden directory named in the telnet
session to get your own copy.
MIT-PGP is for U. S. and Canadian use only, but MIT is only distributing it
within the USA (due to some archaic export control laws).
You can also get PGP from:
    See ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/README.MPJ
    See ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/mp/mpj/README.MPJ
ftp.netcom.com/pub/gr/grady/PGP (U. S. and Canada only).
    Follow the instructions found in README.Dist that you get from one of:
    ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/Net_info/Tools/Crypto/README.Dist
    gopher.eff.org, 1/Net_info/Tools/Crypto
    gopher://gopher.eff.org/11/Net_info/Tools/Crypto

WORLD WIDE WEB ACCESS

Compuserve file names are even more limited than DOS (6.3 instead of the
already lame 8.3), so the file names to look for are PGP262.ZIP, PG262S.ZIP

MACPGP OPTIONS
There are multiple parallel efforts to write an up-to-date MacPGP.  See the
following for the latest MacPGP beta stuff. Zbigniew Fiedorowicz
 has updated his MacPGP to support Apple
events, and his distribution comes with complete source code. Grady's netcom
directory contains a different version, about which he says "This latest bug
release beta 1.23 fixes several relatively minor bugs.  Source to this
version is NOT available, so its use should be restricted to experimentation
PGP FOR WINDOWS, WINDOWS NT, AND WINDOWS 95
There isn't one, yet, that I know of (at least not a true native Windows
application).  There are several good shells that call the DOS PGP for the
actual work, though.  I use Viacrypt's, but there are others available as
shareware or freeware at most of the sites listed above for PGP itself.
IS MY COPY OF PGP GOOD?
If you find a version of the PGP package that does not include the PGP User's
Guide, something is wrong.  The manual should always be included in the
package.  PGP should be signed by one of the developers (Philip Zimmermann,
Jeff Schiller, Viacrypt, Stale Schumacher, etc.).

WHAT IS ALL THIS NONSENSE ABOUT EXPORT CONTROLS?
For a detailed rant, get ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/cryptusa.zip
WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST IN THE USA?
MIT PGP is only for personal, noncommercial use because of restrictions on
the licensing of both the RSA algorithm (attached to RSAREF) and the IDEA
algorithm.  PKP/RSADSI insist that we use RSAREF instead of the mpi library
for reasons that make sense to them.
For commercial use, use Viacrypt PGP, which is fully licensed to use both the
RSA and IDEA algorithms in commercial and corporate environments (as well as
personal use, of course).
Another restriction is due to an exclusive marketing agreement between Philip
Zimmermann and Viacrypt that applies to the USA and Canada only.  Viacrypt
has exclusive rights to market PGP commercialy in this area of the world.
This means that if you want to market PGP commercially in competition with
Viacrypt in the USA or Canada, you would have to create a new implementation
of the functions of PGP containing none of Philip Zimmermann's copyrighted
code.  You are free to modify existing PGP code for your own use, as long as
you don't sell it.  Phil would also appreciate your checking with him before
you distribute any modified versions of PGP as freeware.
"PGP", "Pretty Good Privacy" and "Phil's Pretty Good Software" are trademarks
owned by Philip Zimmermann.  This means that if you modify an older version of
PGP that was issued under the copyleft license and distribute it without
Phil's permission, you have to call it something else.  This avoids confusing
all of us and protects Phil's good name.
WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST IN CANADA?
MIT PGP is only for noncommercial use because of restrictions on the
licensing of the IDEA algorithm.  Because the RSA algorithm isn't patented in
Canada, you are free to use the mpi library instead of RSAREF, if you want
to, thus freeing yourself of the RSAREF license associated with the RSAREF
copyright, which is valid in Canada.
For commercial use, use Viacrypt PGP, which is fully licensed to use the IDEA
algorithm in commercial and corporate environments.
The exclusive marketing agreement with Viacrypt also applies in Canada.  See
the section on USA intellectual property restrictions for more details.
WHAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS EXIST OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA?
MIT PGP is only for noncommercial in areas where there is a patent on
software implementations of the IDEA algorithm.  Because the RSA algorithm
isn't patented outside of the USA, you are free to use the mpi library
instead of RSAREF, if you want to, thus freeing yourself of the RSAREF
license restrictions.  The RSAREF copyright holds outside of the USA, even
though the RSA patent does not.
The IDEA conventional block cipher is covered by US Patent 5,214,703 and
European patent EP 0 482 154 B1.  IDEA is a trademark of Ascom-Tech AG.
Commercial users of IDEA (including commercial use of PGP) may obtain
licensing details from
Ph. Baumann, IDEA Lizenz
Ascom Tech AG
Postfach 151
CH-4502 Solothurn
Tel ++41 65 242828, Fax ++41 65 242847.
WHAT IS COMMERCIAL USE?
Use some common sense.  If you are running a business and using PGP to
protect credit card numbers sent to you electronically, then you are using
PGP commercially.  Your customers, however, need not buy the commercial
version of PGP just to buy something from you, if that is the only commercial
use they make of PGP (since they are spending, not making, money with PGP).
If you are just encrypting love letters or other personal mail (for which you
don't get paid) on your own personal computer, that is not commercial.  If
you are encrypting official business mail on your for-profit corporation's
computer with PGP, that is commercial use.
Note that there are some gray areas not covered above, and the patent owners
of RSA and IDEA may differ from my interpretation in the areas not covered
above, so if you are in doubt, you should consider the licensing of Viacrypt
PGP (or outside of North America, direct licensing of IDEA) to be cheap legal
insurance.  Indeed, the license fee is probably a lot cheaper than a legal
opinion from a lawyer qualified to make such a judgement.  Note that I am not
a lawyer and the above is not legal advise.  Use it at your own risk.
ARE MY KEYS COMPATIBLE WITH THE OTHER PGP VERSIONS?
If your RSA key modulus length is less than or equal to 1024 bits (I don't
recommend less, unless you have a really slow computer and little patience),
and if your key was generated in the PKCS format, then it will work with any
of the current PGP versions (MIT PGP 2.6, PGP 2.6ui, or Viacrypt PGP 2.7). If
this is not the case, you really should generate a new key that qualifies.
MIT PGP 2.6.2 should be able to use 2048 bit keys.  Generation of 2048 bit
keys was supposed to automatically be enabled in PGP 2.6.2 in December, 1994,
but a bug caused the actual key limit to be 2047 bits.

        There is also an experimental public key server at
        There is an excellent commercial key certification and publication service,
too.  For $20/year or so, you can have your key officially certified and
published in a "clean" key database that is much less susceptible to
denial-of-service attacks than the other key servers.  People need not pay
any fees to retrieve keys so published.  Send mail to info-pgp at Four11.com for
information, or look at You can also mail your key to pgp-public-keys at c2.org, and it will be posted
to the subscribers of that mailing list, sent to the keyservers, and posted
to alt.security.keydist.  To subscribe to the mailing list, send a message to
majordomo at c2.org with "subscribe pgp-public-keys" in the body of the message.
Another way is to upload it to the PGP public keys area of the Colorado
Catacombs BBS (303-772-1062).  Another way is to just send it to your
correspondents.  You could add it to your .plan file so that finger returns
your key.  You could add it to some of your postings.  No matter which way you
do it, you should have your key signed by someone who verifies that your key
belongs to you, so that you don't have someone else generating a key that has
your name on it, but that isn't yours.

be corrupt if made by any version of PGP released prior to May
1995.  To fix this in the source code, change the line in
function make_signature_certificate in crypto.c from

byte inbuf[MAX_BYTE_PRECISION], outbuf[MAX_BYTE_PRECISION+2];
WHERE CAN I GET VIACRYPT PGP?
Viacrypt has versions of PGP complete with licenses for
commercial use of the RSA and IDEA encryption algorithms.
Viacrypt PGP comes in executable code only (no source code),
but it is based on (and just as secure as) the freeware PGP.
Viacrypt PGP for Windows is the only real Windows PGP (and even
it is partially a quickwin executable that looks like a DOS
port).  Still, it is much better from an interface standpoint
than all the others.
Please contact ViaCrypt for pricing (about $100 up), the latest
platforms, and availablity at 800-536-2664 8:30am to 5:00pm

WHERE CAN I GET PGP LANGUAGE MODULES?
These are suitable for most PGP versions.
IS PGP LEGAL?
Pretty Good Privacy is legal if you follow these rules:
Don't export PGP from the USA except to Canada, or from
Canada except to the USA, without a license.
If you are in the USA, use either Viacrypt PGP (licensed
for commercial use) or MIT PGP using RSAREF (limited to
personal, noncommercial use).  Outside of the USA, where
RSA is not patented, you may prefer to use a version of
PGP (2.6.i) that doesn't use RSAREF to avoid the
restrictions of that license.
If you are in a country where the IDEA cipher patent
holds in software (including the USA, Canada, and some
countries in Europe), make sure you are licensed to use
the IDEA cipher commercially before using PGP
commercially.  (No separate license is required to use
the freeware PGP for personal, noncommercial use).  For
direct IDEA licensing, contact Ascom Systec.
Ascom Systec has taken over the distribution of IDEA
licenses effective April 1, 1995. Erhard Widmer is the
person responsible for the sales aspects, and Peter
Hartmann is responsible for the technical aspects. They
can be reached as follows:
Erhard Widmer,  Ascom Systec AG, Dep't. CMVV      Phone  ++41 64 56 59 83

e-mail:         IDEA at ascom.ch
Mail address:   Gewerbepark, CH-5506 Maegenwil (Switzerland)
Don't sell PGP based on Philip Zimmermann's source code in
North America unless you are reselling for Viacrypt (because
they have an exclusive marketing agreement on Philip
Zimmermann's copyrighted code). (Selling shareware/freeware
disks or connect time is OK).  This restriction might be
lifted with PGP 3.0, since it is a complete rewrite by Colin
Plumb.  Distribution and use restrictions on that version are
still to be determined.
If you modify PGP (other than porting it to another platform
or adapting it to another compiler), don't call it PGP (TM)
or Pretty Good Privacy (TM) without Philip Zimmermann's
WHAT IS PHILIP ZIMMERMANN'S LEGAL STATUS?
Philip Zimmermann is under investigation for alledged violation
of export regulations, with a grand jury hearing evidence.
There is speculation that the Feds are trying to make an
example of Phil by with prolonged and expensive legal
proceedings, thus reaping a reward of Fear, Uncertainty, and
Doubt to discourage development and use of strong crypto in the
Even though people in this country are considered innocent
until proven guilty, there is a problem with the system in that
it can take lots of money for innocent folks to defend
themselves.  Because of the broad implications for freedom,
privacy, and the First Amendment of the U. S. Constitution in
this case, I implore all of you who can to help out with Phil's
rather significant legal and travel expenses involved in his
defense.  Phil is a nice guy with a wife and two children to
support, and he has done a great deal in his PGP social
activism to help all of us.
To send a check or money order by mail, make it payable, NOT to
Phil Zimmermann, but to "Philip L. Dubois, Attorney Trust
Account."  Mail the check or money order to the following
Philip Dubois
2305 Broadway
Boulder, CO USA 80304
(Phone  303-444-3885)
To send a wire transfer, your bank will need the following
Bank: VectraBank
Routing  107004365
Account  0113830
Account Name: "Philip L. Dubois, Attorney Trust Account"
To contribute using your credit card (secured with PGP), simply
compose a message in plain ASCII text giving the following: the
recipient ("Philip L.  Dubois, Attorney Trust Account"); the
bank name of your VISA or MasterCard; the name which appears on
it (yours, hopefully :-)); a telephone number at which you can
be reached in case of problems; the card number; date of
expiry; and, most important, the amount you wish to donate.
(Make this last item as large as possible.) Then use PGP to
encrypt and ASCII-armor the message using Phil Dubois's public
key, distributed with PGP 2.6.2.  E-mail the output file to
Phil Dubois (dubois at csn.org).
Please be sure to use a "Subject:" line reading something like
"Phil Zimmermann Defense Fund" so he'll know to decrypt it
right away.

All comments on it for the PGP 3.0 API Team should be sent to:
pgp at lsd.com
WHAT OTHER FILE ENCRYPTION (DOS, MAC) TOOLS ARE THERE?
PGP can do conventional encryption only of a file (-c) option,
but you might want to investigate some of the other
alternatives if you do this a lot.  Alternatives include
Quicrypt and Atbash2 for DOS, DLOCK for DOS & UNIX, Curve
Encrypt (for the Mac), HPACK (many platforms), and a few
Quicrypt is interesting in that it comes in two flavors:
shareware exportable and registered secure.  Atbash2 is
interesting in that it generates ciphertext that can be read
over the telephone or sent by Morse code.  DLOCK is a no-frills
strong encryption program with complete source code.  Curve
Encrypt has certain user-friendliness advantages.  HPACK is an
archiver (like ZIP or ARC), but with strong encryption.
A couple of starting points for your search are:
(see ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/README for the ???????)
HOW DO I SECURELY DELETE FILES (DOS)?
If you have the Norton Utilities, Norton WipeInfo is pretty
good.  I use DELETE.EXE in del110.zip, which is really good at
deleting existing files, but doesn't wipe "unused" space.
WHAT DO I DO ABOUT THE PASS PHRASE IN MY WINDOWS SWAP FILE?
The nature of Windows is that it can swap any memory to disk at
any time, meaning that all kinds of interesting things could
end up in your swap file.
WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO PGPfone(tm)?
It is still in the design stages, with a release target of August 1st.
Get Nautilus, instead, for now.
WHERE DO I GET NAUTILUS?
Bill Dorsey, Pat Mullarky, and Paul Rubin have come out with a
program called Nautilus that enables you to engage in secure
voice conversations between people with multimedia PCs and
modems capable of at least 9600 bps.
The Colorado Catacombs BBS 303-772-1062
HOW DO I ENCRYPT MY DISK ON-THE-FLY?
Rather than manually encrypting and decrypting files, it is
sometimes easier (and therefore more secure, because you are
more likely to use it) to use a utility that encrypts or
decrypts files on the fly as you use them in your favorite
applications.  This also allows you to automatically encrypt
temporary files generated by your applications if they are on
the encrypted volume.

EMAIL/PGP LINKS
 (EMACS LISP)
WHERE IS PGP'S COMPETION?
RIPEM is the second most popular freeware email encryption
package.  I like PGP better for lots of reasons, but if for
some reason you want to check or generate a PEM signature,
RIPEM is available at ripem.msu.edu.  There is also an
exportable RIPEM/SIG.
HOW DO I PUBLISH MY PGP PUBLIC KEY?
Send mail to one of these addresses with the single word "help"
in the subject line to find out how to use them.  These servers
sychronize keys with each other.

WHERE CAN I GET VIACRYPT PGP?
Viacrypt has versions of PGP complete with licenses for
commercial use of the RSA and IDEA encryption algorithms.
Viacrypt PGP comes in executable code only (no source code),
but it is based on (and just as secure as) the freeware PGP.
Viacrypt PGP for Windows is the only real Windows PGP (and even
it is partially a quickwin executable that looks like a DOS
port).  Still, it is much better from an interface standpoint
than all the others.
Please contact ViaCrypt for pricing (about US $100 up), the latest
platforms, and availablity at 800-536-2664 8:30am to 5:00pm
MST, Monday - Friday.  They accept VISA, MasterCard, AMEX and

WHERE CAN I GET PGP LANGUAGE MODULES?
These are suitable for most PGP versions.
IS PGP MORALLY RIGHT?
PGP itself is morally neutral.  What you do with it is not.  Protecting
privacy, prevention of criminal theft, and taking due diligence to
protect certain business information (like credit card numbers,
customer lists, etc.) are good uses for PGP.  Concealing criminal
or other immoral activity is wrong.  You can fool the police some
of the time, but you can't fool God.

Pretty Good Privacy is legal if you follow these rules:
Don't export PGP from the USA except to Canada, or from

WHAT OTHER FILE ENCRYPTION (DOS, MAC) TOOLS ARE THERE?
PGP can do conventional encryption only of a file (-c) option,
but you might want to investigate some of the other
alternatives if you do this a lot.  Alternatives include
Quicrypt and Atbash2 for DOS, DLOCK for DOS & UNIX, Curve
Encrypt (for the Mac), HPACK (many platforms), and a few
Quicrypt is interesting in that it comes in two flavors:
shareware exportable and registered secure.  Atbash2 is
interesting in that it generates ciphertext that can be read
over the telephone or sent by Morse code.  DLOCK is a no-frills
strong encryption program with complete source code.  Curve
Encrypt has certain user-friendliness advantages.  HPACK is an
archiver (like ZIP or ARC), but with strong encryption.
A couple of starting points for your search are:
(see ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/README for the ???????)
HOW DO I SECURELY DELETE FILES (DOS)?
If you have the Norton Utilities, Norton WipeInfo is pretty
good.  I use DELETE.EXE in del110.zip, which is really good at
deleting existing files, but doesn't wipe "unused" space.
WHAT DO I DO ABOUT THE PASS PHRASE IN MY WINDOWS SWAP FILE?
The nature of Windows is that it can swap any memory to disk at
any time, meaning that all kinds of interesting things could
end up in your swap file.
WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO PGPfone(tm)?
PGPfone is in beta test for Macintosh users.  A Windows 95 version
is being developed.
WHERE DO I GET NAUTILUS?
Bill Dorsey, Pat Mullarky, and Paul Rubin have come out with a
program called Nautilus that enables you to engage in secure
voice conversations between people with multimedia PCs and
modems capable of at least 7200 bps (but 14.4 kbps is better).
The Colorado Catacombs BBS 303-772-1062
HOW DO I ENCRYPT MY DISK ON-THE-FLY?
Rather than manually encrypting and decrypting files, it is
sometimes easier (and therefore more secure, because you are
more likely to use it) to use a utility that encrypts or
decrypts files on the fly as you use them in your favorite
applications.  This also allows you to automatically encrypt
temporary files generated by your applications if they are on
the encrypted volume.
Secure File System (SFS) is a DOS device driver that encrypts
an entire partition on the fly using SHA in feedback mode.
Secure Drive also encrypts an entire DOS partition, using IDEA,
which is patented.
Secure Device is a DOS device driver that encrypts a virtual,
file-hosted volume with IDEA.
Cryptographic File System (CFS) is a Unix device driver that
uses DES.

WHERE IS PGP'S COMPETITION?
RIPEM is the second most popular freeware email encryption
package.  I like PGP better for lots of reasons, but if for
some reason you want to check or generate a PEM signature,

exportable RIPEM/SIG.
HOW DO I PUBLISH MY PGP PUBLIC KEY?

@_date: 1996-01-06 08:52:10
@_author: Michael Paul Johnson 
@_subject: Ruby Block Cipher Mark 5 
The Ruby Block Cipher, Mark 4, had some problems with slow avalanche with a
worst-case input, as well as some really amateurish reference code bugs that
I apologize for.  The good news is that these things have (I hope) all been
corrected in the Ruby Block Cipher, Mark 5.
The biggest change to the algorithm is that the "family key" is no longer
simply added (modulo 2) to the input blocks, but is used in add and multiply
steps to eliminate the old worst case avalanche patterns.
The Ruby Block Cipher is not a general block cipher in that it cannot be used
in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode.  It is a cryptographic hash function with
a block size of only 64 bits. Of course, 64 bits is too short for a
cryptographic hash function intended for digital signature use, but it is
just fine for a quick block cipher.
This may be a good reference for those folks who want a quick & easy
encryption algorithm that need not withstand nuclear attack but can provide
something better than common weak encryption methods in use in the software
industry.  The small amount of code, fast operation, and lack of the need for
a lengthy key setup time are definite advantages where computing resources
are at a premium.  On the other hand, fast key setup time substantially
reduces the cost of a brute force attack on the key, so use of the full 64
bits of the key is essential.
Your comments and suggestions on this rather strange little cipher are
welcome and encouraged.  I'm particularly interested in any ideas as to how
many rounds (the STRENGTH constant in the source code) are appropriate for
well-balanced security.
Information on the Ruby Block Cipher is available as
ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/public/ruby_m5.ps.gz or
and, if you are in the USA or Canada, a reference implementation and a sample
file encryption program with free source code is in
where the ??????? is revealed in
ruby_m5.zip is also available on the Colorado Catacombs BBS at 303-772-1062.
I urge caution in using such a new cipher in actual applications, but if you
feel the need to, you might consider asking me if any known weaknesses have
been reported before you do.
Note: this is not a product for sale (it is free and probably worth at least
as much as you pay for it).  It is also not a prepublication (it is THE
publication in electronic form with no paper publication anticpated in the
near future).

IS PGP LEGAL?
Yes.  See ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/getpgp.asc for some of the issues.
WHAT IS PHILIP ZIMMERMANN'S LEGAL STATUS?
Philip Zimmermann was under investigation for alleged violation of export
regulations, with a grand jury hearing evidence for about 28 months, ending
11 January 1996. The Federal Government chose not to comment on why it
decided to not prosecute, nor is it likely to.  The Commerce Secretary stated
that he would seek relaxed export controls for cryptographic products, since
studies show that U. S. industry is being harmed by current regulations.
Philip endured some serious threats to his livelihood and freedom, as well as
some very real legal expenses, for the sake of your right to electronic
Although there was no direct and open legal battle, there was a lot of behind
the scenes work by Phil's legal team, headed by Philip L. Dubois
(dubois at dubois.com). GREAT JOB!  If you ever are in the situation of needing
a good lawyer to help you with similar Federal harassment, consider yourself
fortunate if Mr. Dubois will take your case.
Philip Zimmermann is breathing more easily these days, still a free man and
able to work to support his family.  The battle is won, but the war is not
over. The regulations that caused him so much grief and which continue to
dampen cryptographic development, harm U. S. industry, and do violence to the
U. S. National Security by eroding the First Ammendment of the U. S.
Constitution and encouraging migration of cryptographic industry outside of
the U. S. A. are still on the books.  If you are a U. S. Citizen, please
write to your U. S. Senators, Congressional Representative, President, and
Vice President pleading for a more sane and fair cryptographic policy.

WHERE CAN I GET VIACRYPT PGP?
Viacrypt has versions of PGP complete with licenses for commercial use of the
RSA and IDEA encryption algorithms. Viacrypt PGP comes in executable code
only (no source code), but it is based on (and just as secure as) the
freeware PGP. Viacrypt PGP for Windows is the only real Windows PGP (and even
it is partially a quickwin executable that looks like a DOS port). Still, it
is much better from an interface standpoint than all the others.
Please contact ViaCrypt for pricing (about US $100 up), the latest platforms,
and availablity at 800-536-2664 8:30am to 5:00pm MST, Monday - Friday. They
accept VISA, MasterCard, AMEX and Discover credit cards.
Viacrypt is currently working on preparing the release of version 4.0
(personal) and version 4.0 (business).  The business edition adds a few extra
key management features (like master keys) that are of use to businesses, but
not really useful for persnal email.

      This is a good technical manual for PGP for most users, and makes a
      better reference than the "official" documentation that comes with PGP.
      I recommend it highly.

WHAT OTHER FILE ENCRYPTION (DOS, MAC) TOOLS ARE THERE?
PGP can do conventional encryption only of a file (-c) option, but
you might want to investigate some of the other alternatives if you do
this a lot. Alternatives include Quicrypt and Atbash2 for DOS, DLOCK2 for
DOS & UNIX, Curve Encrypt (for the Mac), HPACK (many platforms), and a
few others.
Quicrypt is interesting in that it comes in two flavors:
shareware exportable and registered secure. Atbash2 is interesting in
that it generates ciphertext that can be read over the telephone or sent
by Morse code. DLOCK is a no-frills strong encryption program with
complete source code. Curve Encrypt has certain user-friendliness
advantages. HPACK is an archiver (like ZIP or ARC), but with strong
encryption. A couple of starting points for your search are:

HOW DO I SECURELY DELETE FILES (DOS)?
If you have the Norton Utilities, Norton WipeInfo is pretty good. I use
DELETE.EXE in del110.zip, which is really good at deleting existing files,
but doesn't wipe "unused" space.
WHAT DO I DO ABOUT THE PASS PHRASE IN MY WINDOWS SWAP FILE?
The nature of Windows is that it can swap any memory to disk at any time,
meaning that all kinds of interesting things could end up in your swap file.
WHERE DO I GET PGPfone(tm)?
PGPfone is in beta test for Macintosh users. A Windows 95 version is
being developed.
WHERE DO I GET NAUTILUS?
Bill Dorsey, Pat Mullarky, and Paul Rubin have come out with a program called
Nautilus that enables you to engage in secure voice conversations between
people with multimedia PCs and modems capable of at least 7200 bps (but 14.4
kbps is better). See
The Colorado Catacombs BBS 303-772-1062
HOW DO I ENCRYPT MY DISK ON-THE-FLY?
Rather than manually encrypting and decrypting files, it is sometimes easier
(and therefore more secure, because you are more likely to use it) to use a
utility that encrypts or decrypts files on the fly as you use them in your
favorite applications. This also allows you to automatically encrypt
temporary files generated by your applications if they are on the encrypted
Secure File System (SFS) is a DOS device driver that encrypts an entire
partition on the fly using SHA in feedback mode.
Secure Drive also encrypts an entire DOS partition, using IDEA, which is
Secure Device is a DOS device driver that encrypts a virtual, file-hosted
volume with IDEA.
Cryptographic File System (CFS) is a Unix device driver that uses DES.

WHERE IS PGP'S COMPETITION?
RIPEM is the second most popular freeware email encryption package.
I like PGP better for lots of reasons, but if for some reason you want
to check or generate a PEM signature, RIPEM is available at
ripem.msu.edu. There is also an exportable RIPEM/SIG.
HOW DO I PUBLISH MY PGP PUBLIC KEY?
Send mail to one of these addresses with the single word "help" in the
subject line to find out how to use them. These servers sychronize keys with
each other.

For US $20/year or so, you can have your key officially
certified and published in a "clean" key database that is much less
susceptible to denial-of-service attacks than the other key servers.
