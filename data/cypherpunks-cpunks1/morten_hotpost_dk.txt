@_subject: Osama is Jesus 
He can't be a new Islamic prophet, as Mohammad was the last prophet, and
all prophets after him are false.
Or so I read some years ago in a book by some mullah.
I think Osama seen as the anti-Christ is nice. :-)

@_subject: stupid anthrax q: would microwaving your snail mail help? 
In labs an autoclave is used to sterilize everything.
Autoclaves are basically pressure cookers, high pressure steam at 121
deg. Celsius and ~2 Bar kill everything.
The effectivity of autoclaves is tested with spores from Bacillus
stearothermophilus, which is some of the most resistant there is, and I
suspect B. anthracium is quite heat resistant too, as most other Bacillus
But I'd use a pressure cooker to kill the spores if I had the need (and
didn't have an autoclave, that is).
The paper probably wouldn't fall apart, though the ink might not be
readable after having been wet.
These things I know from having worked as a lab technician in a
microbiological lab once.
Have a nice day

It does! It's the heat *and* saturated steam atmosphere.
You can dry-sterilize things at normal atmospheric pressure using (AFAIR)
~160C for 4-8 hours.
Have a nice day

@_subject: Why Plan-9? 
In 3.0 (out around Dec. 1st) you have jakarta-tomcat and jserv ports
that might be what you need. I don't use it myself though, so I don't
know how well it works, or how easy it is to configure.
I think Linux is better at this.
What about  Works best on linux it seems.
I'll play around with it sometime during the next two weeks when I get
the new SuSE Linux.
Plan 9 looks really, really cool too, though. ;-)
Have a nice day

@_subject: Why Plan-9? 
In our local Linux User Group we tried setting it up 2 years ago, and it
was quite easy, and really funny to see how the jobs were shufled
It worked very well, but (at least back then) there were no crypto in
it, only a distributed filesystem, but we didn't try that.
Have a nice day

@_subject: openbsd encrypted fs 
I also think it's important to remember that OpenBSD is quite
conservative in many ways, it's a part of the security philosophy.
But I agree, a stable and functional encrypted FS would fit right in.
(Maybe I should learn to code :-)
Have a nice day
