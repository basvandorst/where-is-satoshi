We are living a fantasy when we expect the government (who ever/what ever it's
supposed to be) not to dictate our lives when we live in fear of retaliation
for not paying our big brother royalties by way of taxes; not to mention there
are undisclosed means of taxation.
But let's not worry so much of differences in power, for the poor and peace
makers will inherit the world. -somewhere in the Bible-

Thanks for getting back on this issue.
However materially or epistemologically contaminated the world becomes, the
meek are the most in number today and historically. Take a look at the third
world, it lives on charity and contamination in great numbers.
Indeed, if there is a world to inherit and the human race is not destroyed as
you say by a nuclear furnace, it looks to me the meek will inherit the world.
That is my view and try projecting it without value judgments.

You have made a point, I share your view.
That's the focal point to power struggles.
You want it all but nature does not allow it all.
To me the question is,
what are the protocols under which a dynamic stability can
be achieved that goes beyond the design of an encryption protocol?

Before you can judge an act to be a crime against humanity.
I'd like to know what acts can be identified as crime,
where is humanity and how are both these ideas brought together.
This is not to question the merit of such an enterprise but to
question the means of it's corruption.

Encryption is used in economic policy,
without it a minority wouldn't be so lucky over the stock markets
and the majority wouldn't have consistent bad luck over it.
Forget General Dynamic, General Electric or NBC.

-what is property?
-how can I appropriate of the cleanest air this world has to offer?
-what property will give me quality of life and not take it from me?

I agree with your response to the first question,
the next two questions are absurd questions suggesting
a simple repudiation to them and by that means,
a simple repudiation to a clear concept of property.
You interpreted the third question right.

The punishment has been justified but is unjust,
it lacks cognitive coherence.
For all the good deeds taxes are justified to exist,
they are not sustained under close scrutiny;
not the scrutiny under which a court decides over
physical restraint of a "tax evader".
All things being equal, these people are slaves of
a new master, a government with the spirit of a ghost.

It's all in the timing.
If the censors are the last to judge,
they self proclaim the right to punish
or take corrective action.
So justice is held in a pyramid scheme
where those not fortunate or not able to be
on top are by definition the only liable to
be judged by terrestrial powers.
The odd thing about this is judgments
are punitive in nature, so those at the bottom
slip further down; distancing the judging party
from the judged. Kind of a reinforcing cycle.
Can you think of mechanisms to trigger this cycle Jim?

With all due respect,
you are not being very constructive.
If I didn't know you better,
I'd say you are loud-mouthing to identify
those not contempt with the current system.
Could you be a legislator/policeman?
The system legitimizes its existence with
destructive/ambiguous comments like the one you've made.
Try changing the system with pro-positive thinking.
