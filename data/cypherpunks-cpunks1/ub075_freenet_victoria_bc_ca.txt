@_subject: Questions.. 
First off, anyone notice how quiet it is in here without LD?
There used to be 30-40 messages a day, now I only see about 15
(Or so.. no KF)
 Second, what size should a remailer key be? Is there really any
need for military grade encryption on a remailer that might have
3 or 4 nested messages, each encrypted?

Not always. If your anon ID has a password set, your message
will just be returned to you, with an error message.. Assuming:
1. The person has an anon ID in the first place.
2. You have a password set on your anon ID. I don't
   really see why you wouldn't.

What happens if I already have an encrypted reply address? What happens
if I already have SIX encrypted reply addresses? Which one is used? Or is *another* one created?

@_subject: New Remailer 
With a fair number of remailers down lately, I thought that I'd announce
my remailer. It's been running for a long time now, and I still haven't got PGP to work. The remailer is rperkins at nyx.cs.du.edu. No logs are kept by me of this service. Aburt, the operator does not know
about the remailer, but if he asks me to remove it, I will.

Couple other things. Mail to rperkins at nyx10.cs.du.edu and rperkins at nox.cs.du.edu will work too.
It supports the " paste header, and will strip all lines after
a "." on the first column of a line.

The other problem with encrypting while drunk, is that the cleartext
is impossible to decrypt, because it doesn't make any sense in the first
place... even with the right key, it looks something like this:
