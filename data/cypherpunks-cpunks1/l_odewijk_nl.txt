with BTC the better it was. Same will go for "it is undermining
governmental authority and putting civilians at risk".
So what is the marginal cost of mining Bitcoin?
The cost is not marginal. The performance of the network exceeds even
SETI at Home. It is the largest distributed computing effort ever done by
end-users (supercomputernetworks for the LHC for example are still bigger).
It would seem you're taking this the wrong way around. If the Bitcoin rises
in value the mining increases with it. If there's money to be made with
mining it is done right away and thus the amount of money made is lowered.
On the other hand no miner will sell for underneath the mining cost. The
50% premium may well be the cost of running hardware at the current risk
Nevertheless the cost of mining Bitcoin knows no upper bound. If Bitcoin
would break 1000$ mining will cost right around there. The two prices push
and pull eachother.
Be carefull not to confuse money theory with practical considerations or at
least do so conciously. GPU/FPGA/ASIC doesn't matter when we talk about
mining as we do now.

Upon more review of the website I'd say it's some solar panels (the thin,
10% efficiency type) some sort of e-paper like display (like on
calculators, lack of product pictures makes it hard to say) and a flex-PCB
with a radio segment, extremely small battery and microcontroller on it.
It's a smartcard with energy efficient display, antenna, capacitor and
solar panels. My guess is the radio distance will in practice never make
the 300m and if it does it wouldn't for very long (think <1m bursts). I
also don't think it'd last very long without sunlight (which is not widely
available in my wallet). Then again I don't think it'll actually do that
much. It'll basically be a nearly passive radio and run arduino like
On the subject of mesh networks, they can be done in a lightweight manner.
They just can't be done right like that. If you'd run a generic mesh of
this thing it won't be secure and robust IOW: won't be useful. I doubt it'd
do consistent addressing in a true-p2p manner. It looks like it's intended
more for burst bitcoin transaction flooding, nothing more. And flooding can
be done without addressing so that's good. It also makes sense that they'd
have "gateways" and that tracking would be helped so much.
Fun but site is build to hype it up. (someone referenced Apple, very
justified) It's a BITCOINcard, make no mistakes. I actually do think it's
quite awesome for Bitcoin transactions, and the formfactor makes more sense.

1) Never may the recording of an event be illegal in and of itself.
This is a "self governance" law. Limiting the governement and police's own
power. It mustn't be too powerfull as to prevent people claiming access
2) Any person, legal or otherwise, must make available it's survailance

Meaning that if I do record something I must make it publicly available on,
say, a distributed open file network. Usenet would be the inadequate
present day example. In whatever format and form is common at the time.
Freely effectively bans propriatary formats and prevents copyright-ish laws
from securing it. Untarget recordings mean survailance style always-on

@_subject: [ZS] BTC over 100 EUR 
I'm thinking this won't crash anytime soon either. Unless some early-on
bitcoiner wants to check out hard. Even if that happens the recovery will
be quick enough. And why would mister early bitcoiner check out now? That'd
be stupid.
Regarding LTC/PPC/MC2:
2) memory-hard/anti-dedicated circuit algorithms:
Who are you shitting here? Right now mining is dominated by those whom
invested specifically into Bitcoin mining. That's good, they're heavily
vested exclusively in Bitcoin. Who are you helping with this? Not the
layman, he still can't compete with the pro's (that will revert to just
buying specialized PC's). Instead the botnet owner is made happy, the
botnet will do comparatively a lot better than it does now (note: this is
bad). I appreciate the notion of making coin generation more distributed,
but it is fundamentally incompatible with anonymity and therefore with
digital cash.
also 2) (numbering error caused by self-publishing) PoS (Proof of Stake)
Given 2 removed proof of work as proof of stake, we now introduce some
bullocks that will favor people that already have money through a
really nontransparent scheme. The idea being you should get money if you
have money. This PoS will cause a bloated blockchain that improves it only
through some diversity of Proof mechanisms. Additionally it promotes
hoarding coins even more than Bitcoin (and friends) already does. Did I
mention it isn't very transparent why one would want this? (don't get me
wrong, it has some interesting factors. But it just isn't a good idea to
require coin for these transactions. It's oligarchical in nature.)
3) About block rewards
Block rewards in Bitcoin are used as a trick to mint coins. Mining
incentive should switch mostly to transaction fees. Although I think too
that they can be used to affect the system positively, it is hard to make
sure it is a positive influence. It has already been extremely
controversial, even though it is so simple. Someone even went so far as to
say that not halving the block rewards causes Bitcoin to "stop being
The control over inflation given here is.. Bullshit. Again. The inflow rate
decreases 8% per bityear until after 27 (why 27?) years after which it will
be up to 1% increase or 1% decrease in inflow. Somehow the author thinks
anyone that mines (is invested or has coin) will vote to have less inflow
(thus causing said miner/coin owner to earn less next year given most
people don't mine or own a lot of coins).  Why is 1% a limit either way?
It's insignificantly small. The author also says this amounts to a
"democratic" system, whilst it is a totally elitist's vote.
There is absolutely 0 reasons to believe this is the next Bitcoin. I
predict proof of stake will never make it to the mainstream. I also predict
that whatever alternative follows Bitcoin, it will not lower the value of
Bitcoin significantly. Bitcoin will become the gold standard. Just as it
has been designed. And it fits its role because it's design is free of
additional rubbish, less is more. And less takes a lot of effort.

Else you'll always have a centralized something that can get broken.
The alternative answer is that you're dealing with two problems. Political
problems, from gag-order-ish affairs to licenses to prevent you from doing
it, and operational problems, the implanted code, the coerced backdoor.
Political problems call for political solutions. Distributing everything is
an approach to evade them. Just like we can write code we can write a legal
structure for our entities. Mega is  doing just that. Put the right thing
in the right country, evade certain punishable things but deal with their
use cases. Basically you're looking at a system of laws, and you're
programming a way to not be subject to them. You musn't forget that laws
move, however slowly. (like dealing with changing APIs)
Operational problems are historically dealt with by controlling the people
working on the project. You should get those with iron loyalty and
confidence in the greater good you're doing. That's nearly impossible to be
sure about and NSL-type-things make it excruciatingly hard for them. Then
layering, rounds of approval, people approving in different nations, etc.

I'm pretty sure that ATM it is unfeasible to produce code that doesn't
contain backdoors. Formal proofs are touchy and hard to read. Code gets
complicated and large. Backdoors are elaborate and sneaky. But the
political problems can be dealt with. And minimizing the code that can
contain backdoors is also a good idea.
You could also go for the never-done-in-production testing method where you
have two (or more) distinct implementations of the same thing, and you see
if the results are totally correct. That way someone would have to hide two
backdoors, for two different programs, in the same payload without breaking
the program the backdoor is not meant for.
There's ways. It's a lot of work.

only costs you whatever you add to it).
Better yet: force existing pool owners a: out of business, b: to support
Better yet: subvert pool managing computers! Make the machines support you!
Or do MITM attacks to get the shares instead of the pools!
Maybe just subverting the developers (enough are US based, hint hint) to

will also cause a rather big stir. A small division breaking into
bitcoin-accepting services and selling the bitcoins will lower the price
directly and decrease trust significantly.
Visa and Mastercard not providing services to Bitcoin accepting customers
would also be quite effective.
Bascially, the cost is lower legally than it is otherwise. And a 51% attack
can be solved with a trust model, should people wish to do so.
Lastly you must imagine there's plenty of computing power available to most
governments on that list. Temporarily using that power for the time of the

The alternative answer is that you're dealing with two problems. Political

Political problems call for political solutions. Distributing everything is

I'd suggest replacing the default keyboard drivers with your own special

The lamer method would be getting some malware for Mac and some for Linux
and placing everything in the right folders. Similar but different.

You could instead target only BIOSs or UEFIs. Your choice.

I disagree with the walking a thin bar analogy.
The problem with security is that if it's open it's really open. I think
it's better to compare the security with the skin. The more skin you hide
the less easily it'll get poked through, but if you miss some spots you can
still get all the blood unless you have something to keep it in.
I suppose an analogy to the human body is the server is more explanatory.
So I tend to want to ask "are there any holes anywhere" or "where is my
armor the thinnest?". And I've found that "other person software" is the
mayor hole in everything. Honestly, it's hardly ever the code you write
yourself that's the problem. Also because hard lifting is done for you, but
the point remains that there's something about big-kernels and systems
packed with bulging software packages are just.. It's hell. So much skin.

I know my government keeps this data. That's why I thought it's probably an
intelligence community wide secret. And now it turns out it totally is.
This is like the soldiers having marched in our streets since years and
years and our government isn't even worried about it. We're no longer the
actual owner of our country, because another country has had a soldier
passively stalking every person in it. If you do something wrong the
soldier will attack. The laws are not fixed, nor are they coherent per se,
as any three-letter-org may at some point gain "lawfull" access to the
knowledge gathered and blackmail you with it or, worse, manipulate you with
it. Say hello Thought Police.
If it's "just Internet traffic" then many people think "I don't do anything
important on the Internet" (they do, but they don't think so). But now
it's *their
every move*. Without a hint of sarcasm it means they are followed within
their houses, on vacation, doing whatever. My government, my country, my
laws, democratically chosen for my and by my nation (let's suppose ;(  )
state CLEARLY that this is *completely* illegal. There is absolute no legal
basis whereupon the American nation is allowed to break the law on our
ground, on our hardware or even just on our people.
Why is my nation so unaware of this invasion upon our grounds? Why doesn't
it take protective action to the fact that an act of crime or war is taken
upon all it's citizens? How come I can see what those capable of doing
something about it can't? Why isn't there a chilling cold schock running
down their spines when they finally read this sort of articles and realize
they have been partially responsible too?

It's pretty common for opposing parties to have respect for one another. To
joke, too, isn't peculiar. They aren't bad people, they simply have
different approaches. Disagree yet strive for admirable goals all the same.
They do also enable eachother's existence. Without the fight for privacy we
wouldn't need the warriors.

@_subject: Replacing corporate search engines with anonymous/decentralized 
I'd like to ask people to wonder what Search Engines really do for us.
Where is the catalog? Where is the cultivated list of good resources?
Do search engines provide the same level of guidance to its users that a
written overview can?
Why don't we create a distributed website catalog? It's harder, as
anti-spam is the core feature. But competing with Google seems rather
foolhardy at the moment.
Maybe the word catalog isn't right, catalogs are too static and not
discovery targeted at all.
Maybe a Yahoo! answers type of tagging/cataloging would work rather well.
Anyway: think about it guys! I'm sure there's a better way than "this
keyword is also in this page which links to other good pages"!

Came to my mail client just to post this.
I know my government keeps this data. That's why I thought it's probably an
intelligence community wide secret. And now it turns out it totally is.
This is like the soldiers having marched in our streets since years and
years and our government isn't even worried about it. We're no longer the
actual owner of our country, because another country has had a soldier
passively stalking every person in it. If you do something wrong the
soldier will attack. The laws are not fixed, nor are they coherent per se,
as any three-letter-org may at some point gain "lawfull" access to the
knowledge gathered and blackmail you with it or, worse, manipulate you with
it. Say hello Thought Police.
If it's "just Internet traffic" then many people think "I don't do anything
important on the Internet" (they do, but they don't think so). But now
it's *their
every move*. Without a hint of sarcasm it means they are followed within
their houses, on vacation, doing whatever. My government, my country, my
laws, democratically chosen for my and by my nation (let's suppose ;(  )
state CLEARLY that this is *completely* illegal. There is absolute no legal
basis whereupon the American nation is allowed to break the law on our
ground, on our hardware or even just on our people.
Why is my nation so unaware of this invasion upon our grounds? Why doesn't
it take protective action to the fact that an act of crime or war is taken
upon all it's citizens? How come I can see what those capable of doing
something about it can't? Why isn't there a chilling cold schock running
down their spines when they finally read this sort of articles and realize
they have been partially responsible too?

The next step is where the federal government declares all state's grounds
to be in full ownership of a private company, so that all land is now
effectively foreign and no citizen's rights apply to citizens anymore. An
American abroad is not an American. That's an official view.
