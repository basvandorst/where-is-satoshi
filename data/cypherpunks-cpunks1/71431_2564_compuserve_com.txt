@_subject: Digicash question 
Forgive me for a newbie question.  Why wouldn't the following inelegant
idea work?
X gives $101 to First Digital Bank, which gives X a PGP-signed password
representing a claim on $100 (or maybe they would do this just for the
"float").  X gives the $100 password to Y, in exchange for a narco-terrorism
decoder ring.  Y, being a cautious soul, calls First DigiBank immediately and gives it the password.  DigiBank pockets $1 and issues Y a new signed password good for $99.  Note that DigiBank (1) doesn't need to know who Y is and (2) ensures that a given money-password is only spent once.  By the
same method, Y can pay Z and Z can deposit the credit in BillnHill's S&L for
settlement.  Or the money can keep floating around until DigiBank gets it all, which is what usually happens now ;-)
Of course, you have to trust the bank - but you have to now, also.
Don't abuse me too much.  Just point me to the right FAQ (...cowering...)

Re. responses to my digicash proposal:
* The bank system (& feds) will know the original and ultimate
True, but they can (& do sometimes) track this with the green pieces of
paper we use now.  With the system I propose, "they" cannot know anything
about all the (potentially many) transactions in between the original and ultimate recipients.
* Example about Alice getting digicash, paying Bob who pays Carol.  Alice
then "respends" the digicash password elsewhere before Carol can deposit
it.  That's why each non-trusting recipient calls the bank to verify that
the password is still valid.  The non-trusting recipient then anonymously
receives a new password representing a claim on the money, preventing respending by a prior link in the chain.
Note that, if the payee *trusts* the payor, he can silently accept and pass on  ("spend") the claim password to another person - but he does so at his
own risk.
* Concerns that Escobar, Jr. could create a digi-bill, spend it, and the
feds might come claim the money from the ultimate recipient.
Escobar would want to use digi-bills already in circulation.  That way no one
could show they came from him.  Of course the government still could say that
the original recipient of the bill was a bad fellow and the ultimate recipient
(or intermediate posessor) should surrender the money.  Having the original and ultimate accounts in banks somewhere other than the U.S. would help.  Having a non-fascist government would help, too.
* bank employee honesty problems
I don't see that this is more or less of a problem here than elsewhere.

I am one of those evil troglodyte NRA members mama Janet warned about.
Along with my ignorant red-necked bretheren, I have protested increasing encroachment on my right to keep and bear arms.  The standard pattern of the encroachment has been for our philosopher-kings to publicize incidents wherein something bad occurred involving a firearm, followed up by
rules infringing upon our rights in the name of public safety.
Lately the philosopher-kings have discovered the internet.  Today, the FBI
has announced that an evil bomber may be using it.  I fully expect to hear soon that bad people may be using crypto on the net for nefarious purposes,
and that crypto should be outlawed.  It's deja vu all over again.

Does it concern anybody besides me that the CIA [with a bunch of underemployed manpower] is jumping into bed with the FBI [whose
spokesman recently testified to Congress that they didn't have enough manpower to enforce the Crime Bill on us]?
Does it make anybody nervous besides me that this is occurring at the same time that the 2ond and 4th amendments are being dispensed with?  While the Clipper chip and digital telephony
bill are being foisted on us?
Is there a trend here?

@_subject: 6/6 New Yorker anti-crypto propaganda 
Highlights of "My First Flame", an article by John Seabrook in the
6/6/94 _New Yorker_ which explains why we need a benevolent government to help regulate the internet (a very sophisticated piece of
propaganda, IMHO):
I got flamed for the first time a couple of months ago. [...]  I had recently published a piece about Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft,
about whom this person has also written, and as I opened his E-mail to
me it was with the pleasant expectation of getting feedback from a colleague.  Instead, I got:
  Crave THIS, asshole:
  Listen, you toadying dipshit scumbag... remove your head from your
  rectum long enough to look around and notice that real reporters
  don't fawn over their subjects [...]  One good worm deserves   another.
My flame marked the end of my honeymoon with on-line communication. It made me see clearly that the lack of social barriers is also what is appalling about the net.  The same anonymity that allows the twelve-year-old access to the professor allows a pedophile access to
the twelve-year-old.  [...]  I sent E-mail to CompuServe, which was the network that carried my flame to me, to ask whether their subscribers were allowed to talk to each other this way. [...]
...[S]ince this person was a respected author, with a reputation to
consider, I thought someone might be electronically impersonating him ... so I settled on a simple, somewhat lame acknowledgment of
the flame [...]
In a few days, I received a reply from the writer, asking when my new column, "Pudlicker to the Celebrated," was going to start.
[...] And many of the [new internet] users are not the government
officials, researchers, and academics for whom the net was designed;
they're lawyers, journalists, teen-agers, scam artists, lonely hearts, people in the pornography business, and the faddists who
were buying CB radios in 1975.
[Lots of incoherent concerns that the vile e-mail might have
infected his computer with a `worm'.]  [...]
The table of contents for alt.pagan FAQ reads: [...]
20 NIGGER JOKES [...]
I suppose you could choose not to double-click on NIGGER JOKES,
but it's harder than you think.  This is the biggest drawback
of the way newsgroups are set up: a really interesting post
that enriches your understanding of a subject is next to a post
that is appropriate only for the space above the urinal. [...]
I considered posting a query about my worm in the newsgroup comp.virus, and I lurked around there for a while, but didn't post, because I was worried that my assailant might hear that
I was posting queries about him in a public spaces - it's difficult to keep secrets on the net - and devise some even more elaborate torture to inflict on my computer, or begin spoofing me in some diabolical fashion.  I had already seen how the net
could be used to hurt someone's reputation.  One day, as I was
wandering around inside the Electronic Frontier Foundation
discussion space, which is one of the most interesting news-
groups on the net, I came upon a subject line that said, "Ralph
Berkeley made homosexual advances toward me."  Ralph Berkeley
(I'm not using his real name) is a regular participant in
discussions of net policy, who appears, on the evidence of his
posts, to be an articulate and thoughtful man, and often takes
the postition that completely unrestricted speech might not be
such a good idea [...]
[Discusses his pain with a net.friend and she replies: ] Imagine these geeks, suddenly afraid that their magic treehouse
[the internet] was about to be boarded by American pop culture.
And you don't have to be responsible for what you say [on the
internet].  The great question for the future of the net is:  To what extent will this extraordinary freedom be allowed to remain in the hands of the people, and to what extent will it
be limited and regulated?  The Internet is not the information
highway, but it might become part of the information highway.
In order for this to happen, though, the Internet will have to be "civilized" - a word that gives many net users the willies.
The net is, fundamentally, about free speech, while the I-way
is about commercial and civic transactions:  it's a route for delivering videos, newspapers, and catalogues into people's
home computers, for filing taxes on-line, eventually for voting on-line. Completely unrestricted speech, which is desirable in a free exchange of ideas and data, is less vital
when you're talking to a business competitor or to your congressman.  The net poses a fundamental threat not only to the authority
of the government, but to all authority, because it permits
people to organize, think, and influence one another without
any institutional supervision whatsoever.  The government is
responding to this threat with the Clipper Chip [...]
[Discussion about why we need Clipper and why good encryption
is bad.]  The obvious danger in supplying people with encryption is that encryption makes it easier to keep secrets,
which makes it easier for people to commit crimes.  With powerful encryption, the net would become an ideal place for criminals to organize conspiracies. [...]  Dr. Clinton C.
Brooks, the N.S.A.'s lead scientist on the Clipper Chip project, told me, "You won't have a Waco in Texas, you'll have a Waco in cyberspace.  You could have a cult, speaking to each
other through encryption, that suddenly erupts in society -
well programmed, well organized - and then suddenly disappears
again."  Therefore, in an effort to balance the good and bad
sides of encryption, the United States government has proposed
that people use a brand of encryption that the government has
designed, which is powerful enough to take care of everybody's
legitimate encryption needs but has an electronic "back door"
that law-enforcement agencies could use, with a court order, to listen to the conversations of people they suspect of being
criminals.  This brand of encryption is inside the Clipper [...]  In the future, somebody will develop encryption that
the N.S.A. won't be able to crack, and smart criminals will be able to talk without being overheard. [...]
[Author describes meeting he had with John Norstad of Northwestern University to ask about his "worm".] "Do I recognize the right of this person to flame me? Yes, I do. Do
I celebrate his right to flame me?  I'm not sure.  Do I
recognize the right of this person to send me a worm? Definitely
not.  But at what point does a flame become a worm?  I mean, can
a virus be a form of free speech?  In other words, could a combination of words be so virulent and nasty that it could to
property damage to your head?"  [Norstad reassures author by telling him that most people on the
net "don't have a life."]

@_subject: How to control the Internet. 
That's the way it's supposed to be.  What happens in practice - not
specifically with Microsoft or McCaw [I don't want to hear from the
platoons of lawyers. ;-)] - is that the big guys run down to Washington, pull a few strings, make a few contributions, and ask the government to use its resources and force to ensure that the corporate-desired outcome results.
I remember when patents and copyrights were _privileges_ granted to
encourage creativity and there was no such thing as "intellectual
I remember a time when the idea of a royalty-tax on blank tapes to pay for presumed copyright infringement was regarded as crazy.

There are things about the impending PGP ban in the Netherlands which
I can't understand.
I lived in Wolfheze, The Netherlands, much of last year.  The Dutch
like to think of themselves as an open, tolerant society.  In many
ways, they are.  Where they are not, they are usually subtle.
This time, they are hardly being subtle.
I don't know what that means.
