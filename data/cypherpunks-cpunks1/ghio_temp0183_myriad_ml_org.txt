Rotate the six faces of the cube so that the squares fit inside, and then
unfold it when you're done.  Possibly you could build two cubes at once,
then have the cube break open and the two 'babies' come out.
I think the toughest thing would be to maintain vacuum inside after you
assemble the new cubes.  Maybe you could launch them out of the atmosphere
instead - It'd be a cheap way to build a lunar colony. :)
