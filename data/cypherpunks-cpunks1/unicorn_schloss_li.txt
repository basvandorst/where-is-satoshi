Obviously it was significant enough to take.  It was also a perfect opportunity for Netscape to express concerns about the future of the technology, which is in netscape's interest.  The astute deal maker would be happy to work with the NSA on his own terms.  Instead, it would appear that Netscape is working FOR NSA on their terms.
I'd be interested to know what a 'government liason person' is.  It sounds to me like an 'in house lobbist.'  There is an old joke in the beltway about in house lobbists.
I also would like to know why you are actively lobbying for 'claification' rather than 'modification' of the current policy.
Netscape seems to be taking the position, "We'd love it if you'd let us do X, but we are happy to roll over for whatever."  and  "By the way, what is the rule on exporting software again?"
I am impressed that some effort is being made.  I think it in the form of 'too little, too late.'  But hey, who am I?

Worked great in France, right?  No terrorist problems there or anything.
Mr. or Ms. Anonymous here has hit on the nose what irritates me about Netscape's attitude.  For them opposing GAK is not voluntarily installing it into their software, sending a lackey (who may or may not know squat about how to schmooze washington and beltway fever types) to babble at a conference, and generally snowjobbing the educated portions of the marketplace by claiming to be on their side in opposition to GAK.
I am reminded of a certain dictator of a certain canaled nation who's anti-drug rhetoric was the strongest voice in Central and South America for a time.
I think it's more about laziness actually.  Netscape would (should) see quite quickly that key escrow is going to hurt them in the foreign market, and to some extent in the United States.  One would expect them to discover this and be screaming bloody murder.
As I have said before, as I will repeat, I'm sure the list is tired of my babbling, Netscape has a voice.  If Netscape were to scream and yell that GAK is unacceptable, people would take notice.  What does Netscape have to lose exactly?  If they still make GAK the law of the land, Netscape is, of course, probably going to comply.
_What does that have to do with trying to prevent it from ever being made the law of the land?_
I am saddened that the company which has so much power today to further the technology, the freedom and velocity of information, and privacy, is such a bowl of pudding.
Which is a silly objective considering the inviability of a NSA designed escrow system in any foreign market.
Determining the falsehood of this statement is left as an exercise for the Why any company would model their efforts after the French government is a complete mystery to me.
Here comes the snow job.
It's going to be a white christmas honey.
Did you buy road salt?
Gee, let's make sure they can do it for Netscape too!
Wow.  Where did you learn your economics?
In the alternative, where did you learn your propaganda skills?
This sounds like School of the America's Stuff.
In fact, if Netscape really wanted to do well, they should be promoting their product, which I might add has a strong showing in the 18-24/5 bracket- precisely that bracket likely to fret over government involvement,
as "Crypto so strong, it is banned in (x) countries!"
WOAH!  Now I'm REALLY pleased I sold my stock.
They bloody well SOUND like the NSA.
Perhaps, perhaps not.  It sure seems to represent the attitude we can expect even from the 'pro crypto' types in Netscape.  If this is the limit of your potential....
Jim, and Netscape in general, simply has no idea what-so-ever what kind of sword they are carrying.  Someone needs to give them a shot of The way you are going, you will.  Why, as you sound so upset about this, aren't you DOING something?  Why aren't you out behind a podium pounding your shoe with:
"We will not accept GAK, it is wrong, we will bury you."

You can be a supporter of strong crypto, and be in it for the money.  I do not believe you can be a supporter of strong crypto and not fight GAK tooth and nail, which I just don't see you doing.  Sure, you will obey the law, but will you do anything to influence it's development.

I think it's clear what you will say at NIST, and exactly what is has to do with Netscape's real position on the issue.
What you have ignored, and ignored in other places, is the fact the Netscape has a good deal of clout today.  If you were really for strong crypto, why aren't you using it, why isn't Netscape using it, to cripple GAK, and entirely doable endeavor, rather than just seeking some redundant 'clarification' of the current law, (which even it it's most mild intrepretation is below the threshold of acceptable to any strong crypto advocate)?
More to the point, why are you telling us what a strong crypto supporter you are instead of SHOWING us?
I find it very amusing and clever.  I just don't think it's a title you   Your suggested

Again, you miss the point.  Again, you twist the issue.  I didn't say they were actively supporting GAK.  I said they were not opposing it with anything like vigor.
Show me now where I assert that "they are really supporting GAK."
I see.  You cannot say that I said that, so you simply assert it?
Uh... sure buddy.
Let's not forget something here.  Netscape is not removing itself from the role of crypto developer.  Quite the reverse.  They have purposefully included crypto in their product.  They claim to be for strong crypto.  I want to see more than words on that point.
When I said waiting for someone else to do something was useless, I was refering to Netscape's "allow others to oppose GAK actively while we do a lot of hand wringing" attitude.
You, unlike me, are willing to let that be enough.  I will believe it when I see it.
This basically amounts to "at some point in the 'near future' I will tell you what we will do in the 'near future after the near future.'"

Again, you have missed the target, and the barn.
I don't care about contradictory statements as much.  I care about a lack of demonstrated effort.  I have pointed to the absence of any single fact or statement that shows Netscape is really interested in trying to derail GAK, or promote strong crypto in anything like an active way.

I am more concerned about what Netscape is NOT doing.  How this has anything to do with what the lawyers (none of whom to my knowledge are lobbists) think?
A cute speech.  Still doesn't change the fact that a little fluff seems to have quite effectively taken you in.
Netscape was never my ally.  They looked like a company worth investing in.  For the time I held stock, they were.  Their morass on this issue, and my general dislike for overhyped firms, made the investment less and less worth it to me.
Netscape did about what was par for the course, include crypto in a product that is likely to be used for financial information.  You think this is some great accomplishment?
You only strengthen my view that you are easily impressed.
I don't CARE what Netscape's past is.  I care what Netscape is doing with the signifcant power and voice they have.  I wonder if Netscape is selling out.
Now you need to read your answers more carefully.  Look up 11 lines.

Tell me it included discussion about the future of the technology, and that at some time during the negotiations the prospect of GAK and netscape's concern over the direction of it was discussed.  In the alternative, shut up.
It doesn't take a legal genius to figure out what went on in these negotiations.  I've been there.  I know what the agendas are, and it's clear GAK was not one of them.  Either show me otherwise or sit down.
(And by the way, to brag and make you eat crow, I have seen portions of the agreement, and your legal staff is as full of leaks as the titanic.  You
would be wise to pull that card only when you are sure it's not been exposed.
Your agreement is another reason I pulled my stock.  My biggest regret is that I don't trust my anonyminity enough to publish the portions I have).
At no time in here do I hear that you will be actively taking an 'anti-GAK' position.  That is, that GAK is counterproductive, against the interests of the industry and that Netscape is going to take a stand on GAK because it is wrong for the industry as a whole.
I don't care what your position is on GAK, I've already sold my stock in your spineless company.  What I care about is exactly what kind of snowjob you are perpetrating after the fact while claiming to be one of us.
You seem to think the only options are:
1. Roll over.
2. Break the law.
This is where you fail.
The other option is active work to discourage a GAK system on the whole as a farce, and unenforceable, thus a waste and a burden to the industry (which in my view, it is).
Unfortunately, Netscape is too interested, clearly, in not rocking the boat while the gold is on board.  Again, this is fine, so long as you don't come to us claiming to be the peacemaker.  That's crap.
No apologies necessary.
No.  I don't care what is.  As long as it is not "we know strong crypto is inevitable, and thus we cannot hope to enforce a lesser standard," then it is clearly unacceptable -  (See Bill Gates, who despite my provincial mac preference, has earned my investment dollar ten times over on
ethics issue v. netscape.  I hope you realize exactly what that means).
All the smallest violins in the world are, I am sure, playing for you.
You'd make a difference if you would evolve to the point where you have a backbone.  Given your position in the short lived 'hype' of the high tech market, I would think you would make as much of your time in the spotlight as you could.  Especially if the market ever wises up to the snowjob you are doing.  (I speak of the company, if not the individual, not that I doubt either of the capacity individually).

I'm afraid you have missed the point too.

I am most distressed because of what I see as a snowjob.
"We are anti-GAK"
Great, tell me what you have done to prevent GAK from proliferating.
In the absence of an answer to that challenge, I have to question the first statement as fluff or PR.
This has nothing to do with Netscape sharing my opinion, or not sharing my view on the evil of GAK.  It has to do with putting up or shutting up.  I have been told that Netscape agrees with me, or will agree with me, I just don't know that I believe it yet.
Uh... read the above again real carefully.  Think real hard about what you have said.
Isn't that what happens every day?  Or did something go anarchy while I wasn't watching?
And this is what I am talking about.  Statements from Netscape and her employees are beginning to look more and more like mere fluff, lies, and time-buyers based on the belief that this kind of psycho babble is the way to conduct your affairs.
I know of no country that forbids private parties (cypherpunks list) from pointing out flaws and concerns with a product.  (accepting of course those countries which lack the basic free speech, or where the government owned industry is being commented on).  Your complaint about the potential liability of such statements was in reference to the cypherpunks, or at least a few on the list, being 'negative' about Netscape.  A private action for that, when based on fact, isn't actionable anywhere I know about.
Its the angry customer who walks out and takes his consumer cash elsewhere.  It amazes me how content everyone is to limit themselves.
I don't have a problem with the company that is money grubbing until they try to convince me that they are not and then fail utterly to back it up.
One might even say that's a form of fraud.
Except try and educate the common man.  Look like anything that has been going on here on the list?  Duh.
And griping and moaning isn't educating the common man because...?

It would be if there were not some context here.  For example:
Yet I've not heard anyone else arguing, e.g., that you have done more to promote anti-war ideals than anyone else. (A case that was made for Netscape and crypto)  I have also not heard you assert that you are actively lobbying against war.  (As employees and others have argued Netscape is doing)  I have also not heard you flip flop on your position.  (Which in my view, and other's, Netscape has).  Were you in a position where you had a great deal of infulence over war policy, I think you would agree that others asking 'what exactly have you done to eliminate war' is not quite as alien to the context of your example.
In short, your example is argumentation by reduction.
Their employees have also asserted that they are working actively to discourage GAK, that they are lobbying to get it (insert ambigious words here) and on every attempt to get some clairification I have seen hedging, assertions that quickly dissolved under the mildist prodding, and snowjobbing.
It certainly doesn't make them active "anti-GAK" either.  Netscape needs to realize that the sword they carry is sharp.  If they choose not to use it, I want to know why.  Actually, even if I don't know why, I don't care, so long as they don't lie or decieve, throwing up thin veils to conceal their lack of organization, appreciation of their position, or simple laziness and lack of concern.

I read it quite carefully.  I just was not as easily taken in by the double speak as you were.
Hoping others will do something is about as useful as sitting on your thumb.
Netscape is in a position to make some policy impact here.  If they insist on going another way, I want to hear why, not that they are all on our side and we should be nice because really we're all in this together, and afterall, Netscape isn't such a bad lot.
They can support whoever they like.  I just want to hear WHY.  More importantly, I don't want to be snowed with some horse hockey answer.  It insults my intelligence.  Yours was obviously unaffected.
I believe you actually think you are teaching me something here.
I said before, and I will say again.  If Netscape is against GAK, then let them be AGAINST GAK.  If they are just going to try and finesse their way into the market without making to many waves, let's hear it that way instead of some crap about how they are 'lobbying actively against GAK' (Which I might point out, is an assertion that fell apart at the most basic prodding).
I really think you are pompus enough to think you are teaching people things they don't know here.
I invite you to re-read the entire conversation and discover, as an exercise, that the issue is not what the government is or is not doing, but what netscape is or is not doing.  I could care about Netscape's loose-lipped lawyers.

Your ignorance is assuming that the options you present are the only options available.  JW made the same mistake.  In logical discourse this is called "narrowing the field."  It's a version of the 'straw man' and a classic flaw in logical argument.
This has got to be the most ironic of signatures I have ever seen.
Why don't you begin to apply the cute quotes you put in your .sig to real life and tell Netscape to grow a backbone and say 'No.' to GAK?

@_subject: Is there a lawyer in the house? 
Yes.  Unless it could be shown there their was an expactation of privacy in the transfer, or that there was an understanding that you intended this to be a confidential matter.  Or in the alternative, that the relationship between you and the third party is suggestive of such a confidence on its face.  Remember this is a ex post ruling.  The police will just come in and take the information, you have to fight it AFTER the fact.  It sounds fine in e-mail to ask the question "How will they get in" but in real life it becomes a much less realistic proposition.
Yes.  I have seen holdings which indicate that information given to an employer, where there was no obvious expection that it be kept confidential, estopped 4th amendment protections to its introduction when obtained without a warrant.
Hardly.  See above.  It hinges on the nature of the relationship and how it bears on the expectation of privacy.  The supreme court has ruled that the relationship with the phone company does not meet such a standard, and one can assume ISP's apply the same way.  I could go on spilling out holdings if there is enough interest.
Again, because of the nature of the relationship.  There is an expectation that a conversation with an attorney is one of the most private exchanges you can engage in.  As for rare exceptions, I'm not so sure I would term them rare.
It essentially prevents you from claiming you really had a demonstrated privacy interest in it, unless there are other circumstances to indicate such an interest.  Think of the court as saying "How the hell is this private if you told maggy and fred?"
I don't know where you came up with the lawyer example.  I don't know that anyone was claiming that one could break the attorney client trust on this basis.  However, I think, as a tangential matter, a court will examine very closely a claim that keys protected by such a trust can not be used as evidence.  To hold this so broadly would be to tell the criminal he merely needs to give the weapon used in a crime to his attorney to prevent its introduction.
You also need to make a distinction between a 4th amendment matter (which is the issue at hand) and the seperate and distinct protection of the attorney client relationship.
"A person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parites."  _Smith v. Maryland_, 442 U.S. 735 (1979); _California v. Greenwood_, 486 U.S. 35 (citing Smith) (1988).

The real concern is this:
Bob gives his key to alice.
The cops walk into alice's place and 'convince' alice to turn the key over whithout a warant.  Perhaps alice is more susceptible to persuasion because of some external reasons.  Alice does, Bob has no privacy
interest in the key, Bob can no longer argue that it is protected under the 4th amendment.
Now let's get more sinister.
The cops mysteriously 'find' the key somewhere without a warrant.
Bob cannot argue that the key should be surpressed on the basis of the 4th amendment because he gave it to Alice, and thus clearly it's not information he was interested in protecting.  (This is assuming the cops didn't violate other areas, or break into a house or something, or that if they did, that the court will find out about it).
That's the rationale.

There are MANY circumstances where a presence may be searched without a search warrant per se.  For example, a search of the premises incident to a lawful arrest.
Which point?  If you mean that the key is your property and not violable simply by virtue of that fact, then I have to tell you that you are over estimating the amount of protection you have.  You have to demonstrate a definate expectation of privacy in the key first.  Giving it to Alice tends to weaken your case in that regard.
Does the fact that you have given your key to Alice mean that the police can violate OTHER protections that the 4th amendment provides, of course not.  The police cannot just break down your door because you gave your key to Alice and it happens to be in your house.  Alice has nothing to do with the expectation of privacy you have in your house.  However, once they have their hands on the key, warrant or not, if you have not demonstrated an expectation of privacy in the item, you're not going to get Fourth amendment protections.
If I am talking in the wrong direction, present me with a direct question and I will try to confine my musings to it's precise context.

Then as a defense attorney, I would argue that Bob had an obvious expectation of privacy with Alice, and that the fact that he relayed this key to Alice only under those circumstances represents a definite expression of his intent to keep the key private, thus triggering 4th amendment protections.  My view is that this would be a very strong argument.

This becomes highly speculative.
My inclination is to say that it would hinge on the conditions under which you tendered the key to the legal department of your employer.  This is a question of law, and would probably depend as much on the judge as on the circumstances.  Remember, 4th amendment rulings AGAINST the prosecution are very tough for a judge to make, because they usually mean excluding evidence key to the prosecution's case, and most often they arise in circumstances where the defendant looks guilty as sin.

You've taken the narrow answer I was trying to give out of context.
As for fifth amendment questions, That's another discussion entirely.  If this was not an error, then you have still taken the question way beyond the
narrow scope I was addressing.
I was answering only as to how the manifestation of Bob's privacy
interest might impact the argument that the key was no longer a protected interest acording to the Smith v. Maryland ruling, and thus unprotected by the fourth amendment on those grounds.  (Assuming it would even be
applied to the Bob - Alice relationship in terms of crypto keys).
Your statement "Bob's Fourth Amendment rights are not triggered by his contract with Alice."  Is probably correct in the event the key is obtained from Alice.  It may not be if the key is obtained by electronic measures or otherwise without a warrant and then the argument is made after the fact that Bob has exerted no expectation of privacy over the key.  This is the key question which bears on the key escrow's effect on Bob's protection (Alice in that example being the escrow agent).  Clearly Alice in that circumstance is unlikely to give up the key without a warrant.  The real worry is that the authorities are given free reign to obtain the key by other methods from Bob, or Bob's communications without a warrant by the mere fact that Bob has "tendered" the information to Alice (the escrow agent).
Again, I'm addressing the narrow issue of voluntary surrendering of key information to an escrow agent and it's effect on the 'third party' rule in Smith v. Maryland, not the eventual outcome of an exclusionary My prefered and soon to be permanent e-mail address: unicorn at schloss.li

And later.
The term 'pressing a defendant for a plea' came from the practice of piling heavy weights on a defendant and 'pressing' him into the very floor of the court. (As defendants who did not admit a plea would save their family from being held accountable to judgment, the incentive to remain silent was high).  Often weight was piled atop the hapless defendant until he or she expired, having refused to enter a plea.

This is not strictly true.
The Chinese are widely reputed to have penetrated both Japanese and Russian services quite completely.  Their industrial espionage has been far reaching (United States, U.K., Germany) and their political disruptive and fund raising activites have included fully funding arms dealers in California and all over the western United States.
In the mid 80s several "former" Chinese intelligence officers appeared in California and opened gun shops.  Their prices on Chinese made weapons were so low that compeditors couldn't figure out how it was done.  Finally someone did some poking around and found that the Chinese government was literally giving the weapons to the agents, allowing them to keep something like 80% of the profits.  Really quite a clever (and typically communist) scheme.
"The capitalist pigs will destroy themselves with our guns and pay us for the favor.  Muahahah!"

@_subject: So, what crypto legislation (if any) is necessary? 
Now, if this is your postion, let's see some support.
If you're trying to tell me that your going to see some mass uprising of the baby ISP's just because compelled discovery orders leave a sour taste in Mr. Bell's or anyone else's mouth, I just think you are a fool.
Compelled discovery orders work because they are backed with the very credible threat of financial and custodial sanctions.  Obstruction, or conspiracy is a crime, and in the case of the FBI, a federal crime of some magnitude.
While some ISP's may indeed feel they are able to resist the whims and enforcement powers of the United States, they are likely to be offshore, small, and viewing themselves as out of the reach of U.S. jurisdiction.  With the scope of U.S. jurisdiction for compelled discovery, however, I think that most ISP's will find themselves in for significant surprises.
Mr. Bell somehow assumes that smaller ISP's will be less vulnerable.  I believe this in error.  Smaller ISP's won't even have the financial wherewithall to fight a compelled discovery order properly, much less actualy prevail in court where it is firmly estlablished that compelled discovery orders will be enforced and enforced with vigor, and that judicial review will be a waste of time.
Part of Mr. Bell's error lies in his basic assumptions about the political makeup and convictions of the general business community, even the small business community.
Mr. Bell, as demonstrated by his belief that small ISP's and other service providers will risk freedom, fines, and asset forfeiture, seems to think that the rumblings of a grass roots revolution are in the wind.  Why Mr. Bell thinks this, other than the fact that it seems his personal fantasy, is without explanation.
It is worth bearing in mind that subpoenas are not the only tool that authorities can use to affect compliance.  In many cases authorities simply seize the equipment and hold it for the statuatory period before which  they are required to file charges in.  The Ripco BBS in Chicago, victim of the Sun Devil raids, is a prime example.  In that case the equipment was seized (via sealed warrant which later proved to authorize seizure of "computer or other electronic equipment of any nature."  and in actuality resulted in the seizure of everything from disks to printers to telephones), and held for five years before finally being returned.  Clearly it was obsolete by this time.  No charges have been filed.
While I'm sure Mr. Bell would sacrifice hardware, freedom, cash, (though I'm sure he would insist on representing himself), and time to fight the tyrany of the FBI, I don't see every ISP suddenly turning into a Montana freemen armed standoff with the authorities, which is what it would practically take to resist such warrants and exercise of authority, even by preemptive or malicious encryption or disposal of data.
In short, welcome to the real world, Mr. Bell.
In practice many ISP's or phone co's will not have the opportunity to defend the matter in court without their services and equipment being forcibly seized preemptively.
So the ISP sues their client to notify them of the wiretap?  Or the ISP sues the FBI and then draws the client into the suit?  I'm not sure what you mean here.  In any event it's a totally meaningless point as ongoing investigations could easily be blinded and the ISP or telco charged with willful obstruction or conspiracy to destroy material evidence to a crime, accessory after the fact in effect.
What you have described is a crime.  Your "clever" lawsuit isn't going to fool any judge, or anyone else.
Wrong.  See above.
This argument relies heavily on the absence of other persuasion to comply with wiretaps, which, as I have demonstrated, exist in abundance.  Thus the thing falls in upon itself.
Significant precedent exists, see my note.
You're claiming that a court is going to distinguish the case where a small ISP/telco refuses to comply with a compelled discovery order from a case where a large telco typically complies with a discovery on the basis that the large company complies only under compulsion or in self interest?
This amounts to "A obeys the law because he wants to.  B doesn't want to obey the law, therefore B need not."
The "attorney" who makes this argument will be laughed out of the courtroom.
As I have tried to explain to Mr. Bell before, the days of legal formalism are over.  Substance over form prevails today.  The substance of this transaction is to inform the client that an investigation is ongoing.  This is a major no-no, whatever Mr. Bell thinks he knows.
As I explained before, contracts are void to the extent they are illegal.  Mr. Bell's response?  "Well, then we'll kill him and enforce the contract that way."
Your use of the word "indirect" is stretching the bounds of the imagination.  A judge, unless sleeping through argument, would see through this like glass.
Incorrect.  They have been challenged time and time again in the context of compelled discovery.  Time and time again compelled discovery has been required, TRO's forbidding the destruction of documents and other evidence issued, search warrants and seizure effected in place of subpoena.
The telco in past has not complied with such orders because of some grand government conspiracy, although I realized Mr. Bell finds such things immensely sexy.  It has complied because its officers faced criminal and financial sanctions for non-compliance.
There are ways to resist compelled discovery.  These are not they.

I'm not sure an appeals court will be particularly receptive to this argument.  I'll do a little research on the issue next week but I suspect that appeals courts will be reluctant to overturn contempt charges on this basis.  Firstly, appeals courts generally do not do their own findings of fact, but take the lower courts findings for granted.  Secondly, in the absence of serious error, higher courts are unlikely to give their fellows a hard time.  The culture of the jurist as it In the case where one appeals on the basis that the data cannot be retrieved because of cryptographic protections, an appeals court is unlikely to disturb the lower courts implicit finding that the data is recoverable.  "Why would our esteemed member of the bench below impose such sanctions if he did not believe they might shake loose the very evidence he seeks?"
Not impossible that it would come out the other way, but I suspect it would have to be a really obvious error on the part of the court below.
I might add that the Cayman Islands are full of trust companies with provisions which forbid the disclosure of data to a client who is coerced.  A law on the books refuses to recognize "consent" orders made under judicial compulsion.  This would give the appearance of total unavailability of evidence and suggest the futility of contempt charges.  Yet courts have still, and with no small measure of success, imposed sanctions on witnesses so protected.

Unicorn is fine, don't be snide.
I don't provide legal "advice" on the list.
If you mean, as I believe you do, that there is or can be a manner of "unofficial" expiration, I am in agreement with you.
This is about exactly correct.  While occassionally actual sentences are passed down, this is rare and contempt generally falls into the bucket of "until the witness becomes more cooperative."
The above is essentially correct.  The variable of the most consequence in such cases is the judge however.  One must convince the judge that no further incarceration will prove effective.  A witness' attorney could make showings to the court until he was blue in the face about the unavailability of the data because of cryptographic protocol.  He could even be right, but unless he convinces the judge, the witness is still going to be subject to the whims (yes, Mr. Bell, I do mean whims) of the judge.  Appealing contempt orders can be frustrating.  Most jurisdictions I've worked in use the "clear error" standard, which is difficult enough to beat in itself, and nearly impossible when the subject of the ruling before an appeals court is a fellow member of the bench.
To me this entire thread has threatened to suggest to people that they need only thumb their noses at the authorities, be it by cryptographic protocol or otherwise, and sit back in their easy chair and smile to themselves.  Practically speaking security is a self assured right in this regard.  Depending on anyone, be it your ISP, your attorney, or the constitution, is a foolish measure.  Mr. Parekh hit the nail on the head.  No ISP in its right mind is going to ask for trouble.  If I'm a prosecutor and I suspect that the ISP may be complicit in hiding evidence, I'm going to ask for a search and seizure warrant (a la sun devil) and just walk in and take the equipment I believe the data to be on and then satisify myself that it's unattainable.  In effect even some kind of insurance pool, or professional group of ISP's will have to provide for replacement of seized equipment to effectively prevent harm from government intervention.  This gets expensive real fast and as risk can only be assessed by the stated policy of the ISP with regard to resisting government, it will be the active resisters who find themselves with the whopping size premiums.
I understand that direct confrontation with government is appealing to the authority hater.  (I happen to be one).  Overt resistance, however, of the character suggested by Mr. Bell and others, is going to cause problems in two ways.  Firstly, its going to cause the individual resister a good deal of headaches.  Secondly, its going to make bad law The solution is more about protocol than anything else.  I'll be interested to see what courts come up with when it becomes clear that offshore and properly protected data is impossible to obtain with the current tools available to the judiciary.  I suspect that if enough big cases get stung by the crypto bee, someone is going to try and invent a bug lamp.

Instead I'm going to ask the author to look up "taxable event."  Seems Mr. Bell now has an LL.M. in taxation.
This assumes that the e-cash is never converted into anything other than more e-cash.  It also assumes that the IRS will not assess taxes on currency held in a foreign denomination by converting it (theoretically) to U.S. currency values first.  In fact this is precisely what is done.  If the e-cash you are holding in your pocket, or whatever, changes dramaticaly in value because of a change in currency rate, then that's If Mr. Bell's supposition were true I could make 20 million dollars speculating on DM or SwFr and never pay the IRS so long as I didn't convert the currency to U.S. denominations.
I hope Mr. Bell is correct in this, but the battle is not over yet.
U.S. banks will almost certainly not participate in a totally anonymous e-cash scheme any time in the next pair of decades.  Offshore banks will be the key.

What this has to do with Mr. Bell's  position, that citizens as a whole had grown so discontented in the United States that they were prepared to rebell actively in large numbers, is unclear.  In fact the Spooner quote adds more to my position than Mr. Bell's:
"if allowed the ballot, would use it, if they could see any chance of thereby meliorating their condition."  Seems that even according to Spooner, the citizens of the U.S. aren't hopeless yet.
In fact there is ample evidence that citizens who have come to believe that a sovereign is beyond redemption refuse to participate in the political process any longer.  Iran, Iraq, the former Soviet Union, Turkey, the Baltic States are all examples.

Gains on currency 'speculation' (which this example is, even in the absence of intent to profit) are most certainly included in income for the purposes of U.S. tax.  Moreover, they are not capital gains income in the case of short term transactions like this.  As a result, instead of the lower rate on capital gains, they will be taxed at normal graduated rates.
In addition, to prevent funds from being removed to non-resident aliens or foreign entities where tax enforcement and collection is difficult, there is a 30% withholding requirement in the event the payee is not a U.S. citizen or resident (for tax purposes).  Note that this requirement is imposed on the paying entity regardless of the disposition of the funds.  That would mean that if the e-cash bank were to pay profits to a foreign payee without withholding, the IRS would hold the bank itself liable and let the bank deal itself with collecting the tax from the account holder on its own time and after paying the IRS.

I was asking for you to support your position that my 'assumption' that "this reaction" will continue (i.e. that telecos and ISP's would cooperate with investigations), was false.  What the history of wiretaps has to do with this, except that it supports my position the government has enough intimidation power to bully their way, is not clear.
Uh huh.  Ok.
Actually, this is not reasonable to assume, mostly because it's false.  While some very small number of illegal wiretaps might have involved phone company complicity, the vast majority of illegal wiretaps were of the alligator clip vareity and require little if any phone company assistance.  This is why Digital Telephony was such a big deal.
   What happened in 1968 This is indeed a creative intrepretation.
  But them's the details.  I don't follow.  Phone company does outrageous things to help feds, so it's safe to assume that they would do less?
And appeals come after equipment has been seized.
I have never offered the view that these things are not distasteful.  You see inconsistancies in my view because you have assigned that position to me.  The reality is that all court rulings require a bit of whim.  We differ in that I don't suggest killing judges is the way to deal with it.
Change the sentence above to indicate that I take the position that is it "difficult in the extreme to prevail in court against those actions." and you have hit my position on the head exactly.
Again, you find this amazing because you have attributed to me an approval of this status quo which I do not have.
I find it interesting that Mr. Bell, who demands formalism as a rule when reading the bill of rights, is so quick to condemn officials to death without their right to due process.
How is this a contradiction?
Service providers can expect to have their equipment preemptively seized if there is reason to believe the data might be destroyed (this is the sun devil example) and as such if you want to resist compelled discovery as an ISP, an open policy that you will assist the account holder in thawarting the authorities is not the way to do it.
Ripco BBS and Steve Jackson Games both contested their seizures with passion.  It didn't get them their equipment back any sooner.
The result will simply be resort to seizure warrants to get the equipment, followed by contempt charges for refusal of the account holder or ISP to reveal the key.
You can fight this, sure, but it's only going to do you any good if you win.  In any event the ISP will be out the equipment for the duration.  Prosecutors are not going to take these developments sitting down.
And so how is B less required to comply with the law, including cooperating with lawfully issued search and seizure warrants executed by duly appointed law enforcement officials, appearing to testify at the request of the court and complying with court orders?
Study your history.  Card catalogue under "Schools of American Legal I thought it might be easier for you to understand.  Clearly this was my Mr. Bell proves that no knowledge is a dangerous thing.
It was Mr. Bell's position that an ISP would provide warning to an account holder, and if it refused it would be subject to the consequences of breeching some agreement.  This was how he 'got around' the problem of the authorities compelling the ISP to cooperate in their investigation.  To do so, he argued, would expose the ISP to contractual liability.
A clause in a contract which reads, and to be clear would have to read, "ISP shall send regular certifications until such time as law enforcement officials, civil litigants, or other parties unrelated to the account holder enquire as to or require disclosure of account holder's personal information or data."
Now, please tell me how this clause, and the warning therein, is passive I merely acknowledge that government centric enforcement is the status quo.  Any approval thereof is your imposition.
And there we differ.
I can't comment as to ISPs.  BBSs have been a frequent victim of compelled discovery and preemptive seizure.  Why precisely you think that court's will make a distinction must be an interesting chain of logic.
Compelled discovery is a wide judicial tool.  I don't know what the circumstances under which it would be ruled illegitimate would be.  I am almost positive that these circumstances would not include an uncooperative and or obstructive (legal or illegal) ISP.
Well I'm afraid you'll have to back this up with more than assumptions and the encyclopedia.
The only trap I fell into was bothering to respond to you.

Agreed, but with qualification.
Most, but not all, tax treaties include provisions limiting or eliminating the foreign soruce withholding tax.  Note, however, that these are typically only treaties that also provide for information sharing and enforcement of foreign tax judgments.  Offshore jurisdictions which do not permit information sharing, jurisdictions without mutual legal assistance agreements, and offshore jurisdictions which do not have treaties at all with the United States (i.e. jurisdictions where one would want to actually hold assets and feel them secure) are going to expose the payee to this liability.
It's a trade off unless one finds a jurisdiction without such a treaty which is  at the same time unwilling to cooperate and withhold the taxes.  Even in the event this jurisdiction is used, if the payor has assets in the United States they will be attachable to satisfy the payee's 30% withholding tax.
In my view it is best to opt for banking secrecy jurisdictions and financial entities that hold no significant assets in the United States.

@_subject: What can the judge do to me? 
An unnamed cypherpunk asked:
c'punks -
I've been involved in a private discussion with a list reader about the extent to which courts can impose contempt fines and sanctions.  I thought I would post the results to the list as many have expressed interest in the ways that courts might try to compel production of crypto keys or compel offshore e-cash institutions.  The bulk of my answer follows.
The key to limiting the ability of a court to summarily enter contempt sanctions has always been the classification of the sanctions.  "Criminal" sanctions, may entitle the witness to a trial by jury. "For 'serious' criminal contempts involving imprisonment of more than six months, these [procedural] protections include the right to jury trial. "  International Union, United Mine Workers of America, et al. v. Bagwell et al., 114 S. Ct. 2552 (1993)(hereinafter, International Union)(citing Bloom, 391 U.S., at 199; Taylor v. Hayes, 418 U.S. 488, 495, 41 L. Ed. 2d 897, 94 S. Ct. 2697 (1974)).  "Civil" sanctions do not require such protections and can be imposed on the spot and without review.  "...civil contempt sanctions, or those penalties designed to compel future compliance with a court order, are considered to be coercive and avoidable through obedience, and thus may be imposed in an ordinary civil proceeding upon notice and an opportunity to be heard. Neither a jury trial nor proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required."  International Union, supra.
The court in International Union also makes a distinction between "direct" and "indirect" contempts.  "Direct contempts that occur in the court's presence may be immediately adjudged and sanctioned summarily."  International Union, supra.  These would certainly include refusing to reveal non-privileged information on the stand, and may include the refusal to reveal the passphrase to a crypto key while on the stand.
The court also recognizes that the indefinite confinement option is available to judges.  Specifically, "[t]he paradigmatic coercive, civil contempt sanction, as set forth in Gompers, involves confining a contemnor _indefinitely_ until he complies with an affirmative command such as an order "to pay alimony, or to surrender property ordered to be turned over to a receiver, or to make a conveyance." International Union, supra (emphasis added)(citing Gompers, 221 U.S., at 442).  See also, McCrone v. United States, 307 U.S. 61, 64, 83 L. Ed. 1108, 59 S. Ct. 685 (1939) (failure to testify).  Shillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, 370, n. 6, 16 L. Ed. 2d 622, 86 S. Ct. 1531 (1966) (upholding as civil "a determinate 24 month sentence which includes a purge clause").
My favorite language from the court defining such sanctions is this:  "In these circumstances, the contemnor is able to purge the contempt and obtain his release by committing an affirmative act, and thus "carries the keys of his prison in his own pocket."  International Union, supra (citing Gompers, 221 U.S., at 442, quoting In re Nevitt, 117 Fed. 451 (1902)).  The court goes on:  "A contempt fine accordingly is considered civil and remedial if it either 'coerces the defendant into compliance with the court's order, [or] . . . compensates the complainant for losses sustained.'"  International Union, supra (quoting United States v. United Mine Workers of America, 330 U.S. 258, 303-304).  And, "Where a fine is not compensatory, it is civil only if the contemnor is afforded an opportunity to purge."  International Union, supra, (citing Penfield Co. v. SEC, 330 U.S. 585, 590, 91 L. Ed. 1117, 67 S. Ct. 918 (1947)).
And on per diem fines, "Like civil imprisonment, such fines exert a constant coercive pressure, and once the jural command is obeyed, the future, indefinite, daily fines are purged."  International Union, The court makes a point to justify severe sanctions where testimony is sought, or the proceedings are threatened.  "The necessity justification for the contempt authority is at its pinnacle, of course, where contumacious conduct threatens a court's immediate ability to conduct its proceedings, such as where a witness refuses to testify, or a party disrupts the court... [t]hus, petty, direct contempts in the presence of the court traditionally have been subject to summary adjudication, 'to maintain order in the courtroom and the integrity of the trial process in the face of an 'actual obstruction of justice.'"  International Union, supra (quoting Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, 418 U.S., at 513 and citing numerous other sources).
Most interesting to the crypto crowd:
"Contempts such as failure to comply with document discovery, for example, while occurring outside the court's presence, impede the court's ability to adjudicate the proceedings before it and thus touch upon the core justification for the contempt power....  Similarly, indirect contempts involving discrete, readily ascertainable acts, _such as turning over a key_ or payment of a judgment, properly may be adjudicated through civil proceedings since the need for extensive, impartial fact-finding is less pressing."  International Union, supra (emphasis added).
Hence, International Union preserves very broad contempt sanctions which can be imposed without much review provided they fall into a rather wide "civil" categorization, rather than a "criminal" one.
I think it's clear, the court literally spells this out, that holding a witness indefinitely until he complies with court orders is within the discretion of a judge.  Compelling through sanctions the production of a "key" (though I'm not sure a crypto key is directly contemplated) is likewise clearly permitted.

@_subject: So, what crypto legislation (if any) is necessary? 
The work I posted discusses many and weighs their strengths and weaknesses.
Generally, and not that I would support the obstruction of justice, the key to resisting any coercion is not to leave anything valuable in the reach of the coercer.
As an example, if you live in the U.S., and your freedom is valuable to you, you're vulnerable.
If you own a house in the U.S., if you hold accounts in your real name in the U.S., if you work for an employer who is in the jurisdiction of the U.S., or if you have assets or an employer in any jurisdiction which has judicial recognition or information shring treaties with the U.S., you're Shooting judges, if the above aren't satisified and if you're in a jurisdiction which extradites for murder, is only going to get you in deeper.
I might add that U.S. courts won't refuse to subject you to process because you were brought into the U.S. against your will, or in violation of international or local law.  Even non-cooperative jurisdictions won't always save you.  (Don't fly over or sail into international airspace/waters either).
There was a great article in Fortune about a historic tax fugitive that can show you how the U.S. can "getcha."  If your interested, I'll dig up a pointer.
Generally speaking, if you really need significant asset and judgment protection, seek the advice of a professional.  Professionals may be expensive, but if they will be cheaper than asset forfeiture consider consulting them.
I cannot recommend that you venture out on asset concealing or protection schemes without professional advice, no more that I could suggest you do your complicated tax work without professional advice.
I'll remind everyone that tax evasion and money laundering are illegal in the United States.

@_subject: Any examples of mandatory content rating? 
Well, my examples aren't all going to be in the United States, or strictly intellectual property, or 'age' based, but here:
Age rated, I don't think there are many examples.  General ratings exist. The best place to look for this kind of thing is e.g., FAA safety
ratings on potential aircraft/aircraft part designs.
While at first it may seem a bad example, these ratings are generally mandatory if you wish to market things as aircraft parts/related.  They are implemented in much the way I envision mandatory Internet ratings being implemented.  (e.g., executive Agency created to define standards and execute ratings system as well as enforce infractions by the removal of whatever largess the FAA provides.  It might also be noticed that this is right in line with the conflict of interest trend in government of allowing the same entity define and enforce standards of conduct/manufacture/design).  It might further be noticed that the FAA rating for parts increases their cost several-fold over non rated parts, even if non-FAA rated parts are literally identical.
Mandatory labelling or mandator rating?  I think this is an important distinction.  Most of the mandatory _ratings_ I can think of (FAA stuff included) are implemented in a round-a-bout way.  (i.e. "If you want to market this as X (bear a label) you must comply with Y, Z and U.")  I can't think of strict examples of mandatory "Labels" (i.e. "If you want to sell X, it must say Y, Z and U.") where a product simply must bear a quality rating symbol or something.  Voluntary systems are many.
The green "point" is a german example.  (Products wanting to market themselves as environmentally "safe" have to pass certain standards and then can bear the "green point" label.  This is still in the 'voluntary' labeling class in my view.  It might be noted, however, that if you are selling a food like product without the green point and you have even one compeditor who has it, you're not going to sell a single jar in germany).
The other German example is the Reinheitsgebot (Beer purity law, struck down as violating Article 30 of the ECC Treaty in Commission v. Germany, Case 178/84, [1987] ECR 1227).  Briefly, the word 'bier' could only be used on beverage products produced with only malted barley, hops, yeast and water.  Said the court (translated from the French)  "It must be added that such a system of mandatory consumer information must not entail negative assessment for beers not complying with the requirements of the Laws on the mandatory use of the words "Sekt," "Weinbrand," "Branntwein aus Wein," and "Shaumwein" were struck down in Commission v. Germany, Case 12/74, [1975] ECR 181.  Taken as a whole, the German scheme could be viewed as a mandatory ratings system on type and quality of alcoholic beverages.  (The German argument for preservation of the Reinheitsgebot was that it prevented consumers from being taken in by producers who were using additives.  The Sekt, Wienbrand etc. laws were defended on similar grounds).  Granted all of these shy away from Mr. May's "intellectual property" qualification, but only insofar as we ignore the fact that what is really being regulated is a production process.
I suppose milk dates are "mandatory" and can be considered a "rating" in so far as they represent percieved quality/freshness.
Still, governments are quite talented at making ratings schemes look voluntary when practically speaking they are not.
I think it will end up much like motion pictures.  The net will be asked to regulate itself under the threat of government regulation, which might be an empty threat if the First Amendment rights are applied.  Most people will comply, it being easier than making a fuss.
The real concern, if you believe as I do, that some form of internet rating standards are unavoidable, is allowing the same agency to make and enforce the standards.  IRS, SEC, FDA, FAA, FCC are all examples of where and how this can go wrong.  For a detailed discussion of the problems of government largess in the context of conflicts of interest, See Reich, The New Property; Reich, The New Property after 25 Years.  (Harvard Law Review, I forget the precise cite, but I will dig it up if anyone cares).

I will not, of course, reply to Bell's reply.
Are you planning on affording them due process rights?  What about other rights generally?  At least the U.S. government attempts to do
this.  How about a trial, or does it merely take a single bidder with money to have someone offed?  Sounds like tyrrany of the rich to me.  I might add that if this is the way things were the richest would be the survivors, able to kill their enemies, protect themselves better, and deploy their own agents.  Jim Bell would be uni's first victim methinks.  Sure, implement this policy, I'd love it.  I'm not sure there would be many people standing in the end, but the wealthy would be the last of them.  You're merely replacing the leaders with even more despotic types and without any constitutional protections.
(BTW, read it closely, I said they DON'T play fair.)
I think the U.S. government does a much better job at this than almost any other sovereign excepting perhaps the U.K., which has still had its share of self contradiction.
Really Mr. Bell has recognized something important, though I'm not sure even he realizes it.  Specifically, that when his allies are so few in number he must resort to general terrorism and low intensity conflict to have any hope of success at all.
I don't believe anyone has any special dispensation.  It's all a question of who can get away with it.  For all your moaning and whining, you are still less able to get away with it than agents of the CIA and the men on top.  It must be killing you.  I can feel the way the knife twists in you with the realization that you are another small gear in the machine.
You and the Unabomber.  Horrified at the thought that you might be insignificant.  Driven by the need to be important, noticed.
Some people work to change the system by developing structures to work within it, or around it.
You call for the assassination of (not even particularly important) public officials on the whim of the individual who happens to have cash.
You're a one trick pony and it's getting boring fast.

Uni, can you forward this to the c-punks for me?
PEP: Pretty Easy Privacy, a set of scripts for OneClick that integrate
Eudora and MacPGP are now available in the latest Button Circle release at:
PEP is designed to provide features similar to the UNiX premail program on
the Macintosh. It handles encryption, decryption, signing, verifying,
anon.penet.fi remailing and cypherpunk remailing.
PEP uses OneClick to place a button bar in Eudora, from which the user can
select privacy functions. Buttons pop-up menus of encryption targets,
signature keys and cypherpunk remailers.
Q: What do I do about the rest of MacPGP's interface?
A: PEP is not designed to replace MacPGP, just to provide easier access to
it from within Eudora. For a full featured MacPGP GUI replacement with
added features, try Raif Naffah's MacPGPControl application.
Q: Isn't the name 'PEP' pretentious and derivative?

@_subject: [Political Rant] Was: examples of mandatory content rating? 
I tend to disagree.  Ratings are generally consumed by parents and otherwise custodial entities.  The largest and richest market anywhere has always been the 18-25 range, or 18-30 depending on who you talk to.  I don't have figures, but I think that internet users probably prodominantely fall into 18-25/18-30.  This age group generally could care less.  It's much easier to search by subject or key word than by paying attention to ratings in any event.  There is no real market for ratings.  If there were a strong market incentive for it, there would be no need for government intervention, which there clearly is.  Sure some schools will purchase the services, maybe some parents, but this is a long leap from major market and industry making entities.
And like any ratings system, it relies on the raters subjective judgement.  Not a very market stable or market wise system.  Tell me who would pay extra for a movie that had a rating on it.  No reason to bother.  People don't like the movie, they can leave.  Instead they pay for the newspaper that has the review of the movies subject matter.  No one much cares about the motion picture rating in any event.  Parents perhaps, and children, to the extent that 'R' and 'NC-17' films are mystified and thus interesting.  I can't even think of what the rating of the last film I saw was.  I simply don't care.
Does anyone honestly think that you're going to walk to a movie booth and drop $7.50 instead of $7.00 to get a look at the film's rating before you go in?  Put two box offices side by side with and without this policy and tell me where the line is going to form.
Like the "hot sites" on Netscape's home page, or Alta Vistas?  Or the "site of the day" stuff?  Note that all this is free today.  Again, they all rely on the ratings judgement of the rater.  Given that most of these services are funded by advertizing sales rather than user cost, I think it's fairly clear that users wouldn't bother to pay for them.  They might pay in increased costs for products because of advertizing expenses, but actually paying someone is too much trouble.  I might add that Yahoo is about to go public despite the fact that it charges end users nothing.
That's a far cry from rating.  That's simple exclusion.  There is no discussion of the reasons and rationale for excluding, merely the exclusion.  This is the cypherpunks lite example.  Will there be a place for content/subject based news review, yes.  But it will be much more interactive than ratings made by a central authority.  It will, I hope, consist of software agents which allow each user to personalize his or her tastes (WOW!, that new compuserve deal is selling custom news selection I believe).  Given the option of that kind of control, who the hell wants a centralized rating system?  I can perhaps see that there may be serach fields which include ratings on content, much like there are search fields in library databases that permit you to find all the books over 200 pages on the planet, but that these of themselves are going to be significant I very much doubt.
I believe this wrong.  Neither copyright or selection are going to be viable businesses without advertizing.  I don't know where copyright is going to go precisely, aside perhaps from shareware (which is what it is now essentially, as the only people who pay for intellectual property are those who want to).  Particularly so in the context of audio, textual (Information Liberation Front) and software piracy markets.  Copyright will or will not eventually be saved by trade secret style withholding.  Creators of intellectual property will just have to be paid larger up front purchase fees for release as royalities become impossible to collect.  There will certainly still be collections of articles, information, software which will be paid for by people who need it NOW, but those who are willing to wait will just be patient as the material filters down through the underground markets.  Creators will be paid by compliers, who will be paid by advertizers who are banking on the readers who purchase compilations (magizines, software packages, etc.) because they are looking for undefined new material in a known area and specific searching will not be effective in giving it to them.
Given that agents will be software as well, even these will be paid for only by those who bother to obey the law out of charity.
There has been much talk lately about a move back to the centralized computing model.  Put the software on the server and let users buy dumb terminals and share the software.  The personal computer market was made overnight because this is exactly the opposite of what people want.  People want individual control.  People want to customize the software they run, and they want to have it at their disposal immediately, not by the graces of a provider.  This is literally carved in the philisophy of all the personal computer producers marketing tactics.  "Macintosh:  The power to be your best."  "Radius: How the best get better."  "Dayna: No bounderies, no limits."  "Word Perfect for Macintosh: The power to express yourself."  I think you can even show that those marketers who have failed to account for user customization have failed horridly and their products are the legends of failure.
Who is going to bother with centralized ratings when customized ratings are a few keystrokes away.  The basic premise that people will prefer to have material selected for them rather than select it themselves is, in my view, fatally flawed.
You really think central authority rating a la TRW is a "good thing"?  I submit you've never had to deal with TRW.
You are also ignoring the fact that if such an industry ever does exist, there will be a free market of raters.  Those that don't end up fitting users wants will be discarded.  You can't please all of the people all of the time.  Custom agents can.  A centralized and standardized ratings system is going to be an economic flop.
In the future?  They do that now.  What do you think Alta Vista is?
Alta Vista in its purest form, cataloging, is by no stretch of the imagination a ratings system.  It's also free.  So much a for massive retail ratings industry.
Its interesting to me that you can be both so freedom of information oriented, and central authority obsessed at the same time.
I said interesting, not surprising.

@_subject: What can the judge do to me? 
Mr. Bell amuses me because he can never decide if he's a constitutional formalist, as above (all things the government does must be explicitly justified in the constitution) or a pragmatist, as when he is defending his murderous proposals (we can ignore the due process clause of the constitution and order assassinations anonymously because due process rights are vaguely defined in the constitution and we should look to the concepts of other nations in quashing the U.S. version).
I will discuss the rationale the courts use in making the distinction, and discuss the constitutional issues briefly, as I did before.  Mr. Bell will, as always, impute some express or implied approval of some policy that appears nowhere in my writings.
(a) A criminal contempt fine is punitive and can be imposed only through
criminal proceedings, including the right to jury trial. A contempt fine is
considered civil and remedial if it either coerces a defendant into compliance with a court order or compensates the complainant for losses sustained. United States v. United Mine Workers of America, 330 U.S. 258, 303-304, 91 L. Ed. 884, 67 S. Ct. 677. Where a fine is not compensatory, it is civil only if the contemnor has an opportunity to purge, such as with per diem fines and fixed, suspended fines.  Id.
(b) Most contempt sanctions share punitive and coercive characteristics, and
the fundamental question underlying the distinction between civil and
criminal contempts is what process is due for the imposition of any particular contempt sanction.  Direct contempts can be penalized summarily in light of the court's substantial interest in maintaining order and because the need for extensive factfinding and the likelihood of an erroneous deprivation are reduced.  Greater procedural protections are afforded for sanctions of indirect contempts.  Certain indirect contempts are particularly appropriate for imposition through civil proceedings, including contempts impeding the court's ability to adjudicate the proceedings before it and those contempts involving discrete, readily ascertainable acts.  For contempts of more complex injunctions,
however, criminal procedures may be required. Id.
Because civil contempt sanctions are viewed as nonpunitive and avoidable, fewer procedural protections for such sanctions have been required.
To the extent that such contempts take on a punitive character, however, and are not justified by other considerations central to the contempt power, criminal procedural protections may be in order.  International Union.
The justification for the contempt charges are on the proper administration of justice, to which every citizen is entitled.  While I'm sure Mr. Bell would like it if he could just flip off a court, as with most self centered types, I don't think he has considered the ramifications of this kind of impunity in the aggregatre.
Mr. Bell claims this is a new tyrranical development.  Mr. Bell is incorrect.
In re Nevitt, 117 Fed. 451 (1902) (upholding the contempt power of courts).
(94 years ago).
Ex parte Robinson, 86 U.S. 505, 19 Wall. 505, 510, 22 L. Ed. 205 (1874) (contempt authority is vital to the administration of justice).
(122 years ago).
Courts must be "vested with the power to impose silence, respect, and decorum, in their presence, and submission to their lawful mandates, and . . . to preserve themselves and their officers from the approach and insults of pollution." Anderson v. Dunn, 19 U.S. 204, 6 Wheat. 204, 227, 5
L. Ed. 242 (1821).
(175 years ago).
The contempt power is a power "necessary to the exercise of all
others." United States v. Hudson, 11 U.S. 32, 7 Cranch 32, 34, 3 L. Ed. 259
(184 years ago).
One might also remember where the term "pressing the defendant for a plea" originated.  Contempt sanctions are nearly 500-600 years old and are a response to the need to effect compliance with orders and summons.
You mean an answer that argues semantics and devolves into your Yadda Yadda Yadda stuff.
I suppose you don't think anyone need serve on juries?  Or appear before a court when summoned?  Or testify if its inconvenient?  Your absoluteism betrays a grave ignorance and sheltered view of the world.
Huh?  Ever hear of late filing fees?  Administrative fines?  Taxes?  How many examples do you want where government can impose costs on persons without a fully jury trial?  Even contracts are in the end enforced by government in the United States.
Look, Mr. Bell.  I don't know where you get this stuff, but you really need to take a few classes in jurisprudence.  You need to learn what life would really be like if the strict reading of the constitutional you urge was followed, and you need to transcend your political Yaddaing into a set of criteria which resemble something like earthbound possibilities.
By 'wrong' you mean doesn't agree with you.  I'm sure precident and it's rationale means little to you.
Opinions are like rectums....
Apply to law school.  The questions you are struggling with will be answered in your first year readings.  I'm hardly going to type in all of Ernst on property or Goldman on constitutional law for your benefit.  Time to start doing your own homework.

@_subject: What can the judge do to me? 
Thanks for taking the time to tell me so.
It's muddled.
The key seems to be the nature and purpose of the sanctions.  (And mostly the purpose).
As a very general rule of thumb (as these tend to be case by case analysis) when the sanctions are punative, intended to punish past conduct and not influence future conduct, contempt sanctions are "criminal" and require due process and other protections.
Where contempt sanctions are intended to effect compliance with court orders, or are the result of disruptive or destructive behavior that interferes with a court's proceedings (withholding testomony, outbursts or insulting behavior in the court, withholding evidence, refusal to appear), contempt sanctions are civil, and can be leveled on the spot without any protections or review.
Historically, and in my experience, criminal defendants are given a lot more leeway.  No judge is going to push constitutional rights with contempt sanctions.  If, however, in the judge's view there are not constitutional rights which apply, defendant's are just as likely to get smacked.  (One example that comes to mind is where the defendant waived his Fifth Amendment rights, then refused to testify anyhow.  Prosecution objected and asked for contempt sanctions [for which there was a very good argument, the waiver was quite explicit and the prosecution had based a good deal of argument on it and defendant's existing testomony already.]  The judge refused to level contempt, prosecution appealed the decision immediately and we went all the way to oral argument before the appeals court upheld the judge's decision.  The appeals court judge cited specifically the importance of leeway in criminal cases and refused to find clear error).
These are generally only after an explicit waiver of fifth amendement rights, or when they clearly, quite clearly, do not apply.  I'll dig up cites if there is enough interest.
To trigger Fifth amendment rights, an act must be testimonial, and incriminating.  I discussed it a bit in my note on asset concealing.  I've reproduced the passage below:
The cases following In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 814 F.2d 791 (1st
Cir. 1987) demonstrate how the fifth amendment has been eroded or
eliminated in application to this problem.  In the In re case the
defendant was directed by the district court to sign a consent form
permitting the disclosure and production by a financial institution of
documents protected by Singapore banking secrecy law.  On refusing to
sign, the defendant was held in contempt.  The investigation alleged
reporting and currency violations.  The defendant appealed to the
First Circuit which held the signature as both "testimonial" and
"self-incriminating."  The court reasoned that the consent form
"amounts to an assertion" that the bank customer consented to
production of the requested records and that it was "self-
incriminating" because it could be used to demonstrate incriminating
facts (e.g., that the accounts in the witness's name existed and were
within the witness's control).  Even at the time, however, this
decision was in conflict with the Second, Fifth and Eleventh circuits,
which have held such an order does not violate the fifth amendment.
(Typically on the grounds that the forms signed were non-testimonial).
Lately, clever prosecutors and private litigants have evaded the
testimonial hitch entirely by phrasing their consent forms in the
hypothetical, and not naming specific account names or numbers.  The
Supreme Court upheld the order of contempt for a defendant refusing to
sign such a document.  See, Doe v. United States, 108 S. Ct. 2341
(1988).  The Court noted that the form was carefully drafted not to
make reference to a specific account, but only to speak in the
For more examples See also, United States v. Davis, 767 F.2d at 1040
(holding any problem of testimonial self-incrimination is solved by
such an order precluding use of directive as admission); In re Grand
Jury Proceedings, 814 F.2d at 795 (expressly approving of reasoning in
Davis); United States v. A Grand Jury Witness, 811 F.2d 114, 117 (2d
Cir. 1987); United States v. Cid-Molina, 767 F.2d 1131, 1132 (5th Cir
1985); United States v. Ghidoni, 732 F.2d 814, 818 (11th Cir.), cert.
denied, 469 U.S. 932 (1984); United States v. Browne, 624 F. Supp.
245, 248 (N.D.N.Y. 1985); United States v. Quigg, 48 A.F.T.R.2d 81-
5953, 5955 (D. Vt. 1981).
If there is enough interest, I will do a small note on the distinctions that have been important to courts in compelling production of potentially incriminating evidence.
I have seen a court compell the production of safety deposit box keys in a
criminal case when those boxes were suspected to hold the fruits of a crime and the court had acknowledged the defendant's possesion of the key, and ownership of the box as well as the potential incriminating nature of the boxes contents.  A per day fine was imposed.  If you want specifics I'll attempt to get a waiver from the client and pass them on.

Even if that could be enforced in civil proceedings, it would hardly encourage litigants to just come to court instead of shooting themselves.

Currently, no better than the United States.
First, the Cayman Islands law refers primarily (if not exclusively) to financial information.  Second, the judicial blocking provisions in the Caymans have been much reduced by the U.S. Mutual Legal Assistance treaty that penetrates banking secrecy when it is interfering with a criminal investigation involving money laundering or a series of other crimes.
Third, even in the event your escrow information was protected the court would be much more successful simply by trying to compel the defendant through contempt sanctions.  (It's not always enough to put data overseas, particularly where you're still sitting in the U.S. or otherwise within the court's jurisdiction).
Fourth, prosecutors don't typically bother to try and compell [escrow] agents, but instead seek "consent orders" from defendants instructing the agent to release the information.
So, in sum, the Caymans law doesn't have anything to do with non-financial information safekeeping.  Even if it did, a criminal investigation that would be interesting enough to try and seek non-tax and non-financial information from an agent in the Islands would almost certainly trigger the secrecy penetration clauses of the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty.  And finally, the fact that they cant get your data is not going to protect you from a major main in the rump.
The large article I posted to the list goes into these points in detail in the context of protecting financial information and assets.  If you would like another copy, please let me know.

I would use it to show the judge that she is obstructing and concealing her conduct and motion for all manner of annoying and intrusive discovery procedures as well as use it to show malice of intent.

Perhaps Mr. Bell would have been happier if I had said "bring forth a motion calling for measures to deal with the defendant's supposed conduct in bad faith in answering the discovery requests presented by the plaintiff."  Somehow, however, I doubt it.
Like I told Mr. Bell before, when he starts paying my hourly rate, I will copyedit all my posts.
This requires the assumption that all the data is already encrypted, not an assumption a prosecutor or private litigant is about to make.  The case will then become one of a defendant with a reputation for concealing or otherwise destroying evidence, and a private litigant would be quite justified in calling for measures to preserve what evidence might have thusfar survived encryption.
 If anything, it would make the data permanently Well then, next time I am involved in a civil or criminal case I will just suggest that the defendant simply encrypt all his documents, burn the paper and then turn over the cyphertext to the plaintiff to comply with discovery.  Now the plaintiff will be powerless to touch us.  In a criminal case, the defendant will be protected completely from prosecution by the Fifth Amendment.  I will win _every case_, I will be famous!  They will call for me all over the world.  I will then use my profits to buy a massive ice maker, and freeze the planet's water supply.

Prediction:  During the terms negotiation phase much backpeddling by Mr. Bell will be seen.  This will include a narrowing of the geographical scope of the wager, a revival of the debate as to when a new century actually begins (00:00:01 Jan 1, 1900 or 00:00:01 Jan 1, 1901), endless hand wringing about what exactly an "exemplar" is, and whether he has to pay US$ 50,000 on losing, or the amount representing its depreciation from the time I made the wager.  (US$ $49,999.997?)
The reality is that Mr. Bell, more often than most people, is speaking before thinking.  He pulled his claim right out of the air, which is generally the substance of the support for his works.  He does not bother to research, (except to cite the constitution) or ground any of his discussion in anything like reality.  He backs his claims instead with posture and bluff ("How much do you want to bet that...")  This is smoke he hopes will solidify into substance for those too lazy to check up on him.  (It is worth noting that Mr. Bell has gotten into disputes with 4 people (by my limited count) who actually seem to have a clue about the subjects they discuss.  Every one of these has been in the context of a correction to Mr. Bell's facts or assumptions.  The irony is that occasionally he has some good points, which are simply decimated by the Yadda Yadda Yadda portions of his work.
All this said, I find Mr. May's and Mr. Sandfort's criticism stinging.  Mr. Bell, and my response to him, manages to sap a great deal of time and effort from myself and others for no gain aside draining his (and to some extent my) reputation capital.  These disputes serve little purpose otherwise.  It's clear to me, if not everyone else, that Mr. Bell simply fabricates his positions, evidence, and persuasion out of the mist.
I will waste no more time on him unless he makes the most offensive errors in legal fact.
He is still quite welcome to stand by the original statement that promoted my wager.  I still await an apology for being compared with the Nazi oven workers.
With my apologies to the list for not restraining myself sooner -

Were that true they would have to move out of Virginia.
What you are refering to is the provision in their charter
(basically) forbidding intelligence activities in the United States.
The National Security Act of 1947 defines the duties of the CIA.  It does
so primarily in terms of "intelligence" or "intelligence relating to the
national security."  Legislative history indicates that the intent of
Congress was to grant a mandate for Foreign intelligence.  Consider also
the provision:
"the Agency shall have no police, subpoena, law enforcement powers, or
internal-security functions,"  50 U.S.C. section 403(d)(3).
It was contemplated that the CIA would be limited to foreign intelligence
operations and conduct very few of its operations in the United States.
The Agency was specifically permitted to be headquartered in the United
States and conduct what acts may be necessary to administer that facility.
"In public and private it was generally agreed among legislators and
representatives of the Executive that the CIA would be 'confined out of
the continental limits of the United States and in foreign fields,' that
it should have no 'police power or anything else within the confines of
this country,' and that it was 'supposed to operate only abroad.'"  Select
Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence
Activities, Foreign an Military Intelligence, S. Rep. No. 755, Book I,
94th Cong., 2d Sess. 136-139 (1976); See Also, Stephen Dychus et. al.,
National Security Law (1990).
The CIA has relied in past on section 102(d)(3) to authorize its limited
activities in the United States.  (Generally charging the Director with
the protection of sources and methods).

Now you have to get into the question of who is a trained virus handler.
This is a subjective analysis.  The court is going to have to do this case
by case.  And below in your message its clear you do not hold everyone to
the same standard.  The virus/CPR expert is held to a different standard
in your example.  It is the same standard in that you punish everyone if
they "Do something stupid."  But "stupid" is different for each person.
I indicated only that the standards you had for trained and untrained
virus writers were different.
See my above position.  Three standards.  One for those with training,
one for those without and some kind of standard for determining what is
'enough' training.  Given the traditional institutional costs of courts,
particularly their 'catch up' chase with technology, I don't think I'd
want courts doing these calculations.
But the other argument goes that we have to give the people who know what
they are doing more leeway because they will be judged by people who don't
know about the subject and because if we want to encourage good samaritans
the way to do it is not by increasing their liability.  (You effectively
do increase their liability above by implying that you would like to
impose a stricter negligence standard for trained CPR types).
Keep in mind that doing the "wrong" thing isn't always negligence either.
Doing the wrong thing because you were careless, that's negligence.
Also note that you can be negligent without harming anyone.
It could be argued that it's folly to impose a lower standard on the CPR
'idiot' and thus encourage him to run out and do CPR.  One can imagine a
scene where the CPR trained fellow pulls an idiot out of the crowd and
gives instructions for the idiot to preform the CPR so as to take
advantage of both his increased knowledge and the idiot's limited
liability (reasonable person standard, not reasonable CPR expert
That probably includes not trying to preform CPR... no?
This begins to look like the partial abortion debate, where the argument
goes something like this:
Yes, it's criminal to preform the procedure, but you can absolve yourself
after the fact by showing us (medical morons) that the mother's life was
in danger.
That's not encouraging in the least to doctors.  (Which in the abortion
example, is precisely the point).
The trick is in your concept of "and you do it right."  That's a
subjective analysis.
This makes it REALLY tough.  Reckless usually means extensive punative
damages are on the way.  Simple negligence doesn't always trigger them.
By using these terms on the same facts the idiot gets simple negligence,
the expert gets expanded liability and potential punative damages.
Because the expert will be at significant disadvantage at trial (if he's
an expert, if he knew what he was doing, why did the victim get hurt) what
you've done is moved closer to the realm of strict liability for all
experts. (Strict liability simply eliminates the negligence calculation.
If you were doing the activity, (CPR) and someone got hurt, you're liable.
Period.  No calculation of fault).  What this system does is create
something like a rebuttable presumption of negligence on the expert.  That
starts to look like strict liability.
It creates systemic problems though.  (Like the burden of overcoming the
assumption that the expert must have erred).
In an economic sense you want a negligence rule that balances a few
interests.  First, you want to either encourage or discourage the
activity.  (Virus work or CPR by the side of the road have different
calculations).  Second, you want to give injured persons the chance to
recover damages.  Third, you want to decrease the total number of
accidents or injuries as much as possible.
A lot of the decision whether to apply strict liability or negligence is
going to be based on where you believe the costs should be shifted.
Strict liability shifts the costs onto the person engaging the activity.
The actor will increase his own costs to the extent he can still conduct
the activity and still reduce the number of times he is called into court
and damages are awarded against him.  He will, of course, take no more
care than his damages might be.  If the largest ever award for a CPR
related injury is $500,000, no one is going to spend more than that
in increased care.  The same calculation will be made with negligence, but the costs will more often be shifted to the victim.  "The defendant
will just take those precautions that minimize the sum of accidents and
the costs of their prevention, whether negligence or strict liability is
in place."  Epstein, Torts 5d., 166 (1990).
What you really want to do, economically, is shift the cost onto the party
most able to bear the cost.  ("Least Cost Avoider").  This will allow the
return of damages with the least economic impact after the fact, and
increase the amount of care exerted by the next Least Cost Avoider ex
It's interesting to note the argument that in the age of insurance, it
really makes no difference who you put the costs on as society as a whole
ends up footing the bill anyway.
While holding experts to a higher standard makes some sense where experts
are holding themselves out to be experts for marketing and reputation,
when they are preforming acts like CPR and such you have to consider the
possibility that a careless expert is better than a competent layman.

non-expert) and one of negligence (for the expert).
Other way around.  Negligence is milder.  Negligence is merely the absence
of due care.
Recklessness:  The state of mind accompanying an act, which either pays no
regard to its probably or possibly injurious consequences, or which,
though forseeing such consequences, persists in spite of such knowledge.
Recklessness is a stronger term than mere or ordinary negligence...
Black's Law Dictionary 6d., (1990).
Ok.  The standards you have created for knowledgeable and unknowledgeable
people are different.  My key objection to your position was your view
that it was 1> an objective determination and 2> a single standard.  It is
Adequate for who?  You've already said that the court has to determine if
someone is knowledgeable first.  (And thus in your test bypass the
automatic finding of liability).  This is a very complicated test you're
Above you say "Someone with training ought to be expected to do the
'right' thing."  That sounds like a stricter standard on CPR types.  i.e.,
someone without training ought not to be expected to do the right thing.
In this good faith helper at the side of the road example, do you want to
punish the CPR type for doing his best despite his ignorance?  (You might,
I'm just trying to clarify your position, which seems internally
inconsistant to me).
I didn't know you ment willfully.  I don't see that anywhere.
No.  Not exactly.  It's more of a "wrong without a remedy" deal.
Both of those are crimes today.
The point is that allowing that disparity seems silly.
But under your test it doesn't matter.  He didn't know how to attempt CPR,
he's liable.
And in your test there is a presumption of fault on the non-expert.  If he
did everything right purely by accident or from what he saw on "baywatch"
and the victim dies anyway, under your test he's cooked.
Woah.  Ok.  So you want a reasonable person determination of the activity
and if the activity falls within a dangerous defintion.  (This is called
ultrahazardous activity in tort law).  Then you want strict liability on a
non-expert who engages in that activity, and a "reasonable expert"
standard on the expert who engages in that activity?
Putting aside for a moment my already voiced concerns, doesn't the idea of
having a "reasonable person" standard on the classification of an
ultrahazardous activity seem silly?  Does nuclear physics seem dangerous
to Joe Sixpack?  What about Cold Fusion experimentation?  Microwave
repair?  Seems there's a tremendous opportunity for error in that kind of
standard.  It also has the effect of making the scope of the definition of
"ultrahazardous" very large.  The larger it is, the more interference and
common law regulation you're going to have on the economy.  _Particularly_
so where you are imposing a strict liability standard.
Just legally, an objective standard is when you hold everyone to a
reasonable person standard.  Everyone is Joe Blow.  Would Joe Blow have
done this that or the other thing.  As soon as you start talking "experts"
you're out of the objective field.
Then why impose it without an examination into fault on non-experts?  In
your test the non-expert bears the burden of showing he's an expert if he
wishes to prevail.  The victim need only say "He was doing CPR, I got
hurt, he's a non-expert."  Wham, liability under your test.  That's not a
burden at all.  It's certainly not a burden of showing negligence.
Or under your test, liable until proven expert.
As for faulty assumptions, go to court someday.  They are common.
In designing systems one _must_ assume them.

 Colombia,
Do not travel to or use Colombian banks for your financial needs.
Columbia is essentially lawless outside of the tourist areas and the
concentration on drug investigations combined with the presence of the
military for the purposes of law enforcement makes banking secrecy a near
impossibility.  Given a moderate budget I could have the banking
information of any depositor in Columbia in short order.  So could you.

Banking secrecy is dependent on connections with local officials or
'corrupt' bankers.  I don't find that Venezuela properly protects banking
secrecy from a statuatory prespective.

Better, but still subject to some criminal investigations and limited
statuatory protection.
In general adding a country to the money laundering offender list is a
political decision and NOT demonstrative of a country's actual money

@_subject: US law - World Law - Secret Banking 
It amazes me that this is new news.  I've been watching this since the mid
The earliest of these decisions dates back to the 60s.  Good morning
reporters.  Have a nice nap?
What has consistently alarmed me is the United States trend of extending
her own moral and ethical standards world wide.  Granted the United States
is the foremost world economic power, but the power to control markets and
the political power to invade the sovereignty of other states are two
distinct issues.  The United States is, in one form or another, attempting
to homogonize the legal systems of the world to comply with her own
concept of what is "right" or "fair."  This is disturbing.
I will not go so far as to propose that this is some grand conspiracy or
some "one world government" plot.  I will comment, however, that what
started with concepts of anti-trust, and progressed into the field of
securities regulation, has (publically) become an issue of banking
secrecy and cryptography.
By no means are the states of the world united on the meaning of
anti-trust, the appropriate levels of regulation therein, or the manner in
which to enforce these segments of the law.  That the United States should
seek to impose her own will and concepts on foreign states strikes me as
the antithesis of this once noble power's call, indeed the central focus
of her foreign policy, for the self determination of all nation states.
One sees a larger trend.  The dream of European unification, many
times attempted attempted militarily (France, Napoleon, Germany), then
politico-economically (The European Union) has become a global legal
financial reform effort led by the United States.
While from the prespective of the United States, the position seems
rational, what is constantly ignored is the imposition on foreign states,
particularly those with a long culture of independent and unintrusive
legal regimes.  (Switzerland, Austria, Sweden have all felt the pressure
from the United States of late).
Perhaps unwittingly, under the guise of protecting her shores from 'Money
Laundering,' 'Narco-Terrorism,' Terrorism and any number of international
criminal problems, the United States appears to be a united front for
worldwide financial legal reform.
It is my prediction that this policy, which ignores the international
comity between nations, will severely disadvantage the country in the
years and decades to come.
Mr. May (I believe) on this list predicted the inevitable clash between
strong cryptography and the technologies and capacities it creates and
statist trends.  I join in his assesment.
Private banking in cyberspace is in its infancy.  At the moment
institutions are identified, have a geographical base, and depend on the
graces of a single host state to exist.  Many or most institutions hold
significant assets within the borders of the United States, and still
others derive a large portion of their income from U.S. branches.  These
days will not last forever.
The introduction of a geographically diverse, multi-jurisdiction, crypto
and secret sharing institution with completely blinded assets assured and
accountable merely through blind digital signatures is around the corner.
Such an institution will be impervious to the whims of the United States
or any other power.  She may even hold stock secretly in U.S.
institutions, offer mutual funds investing in U.S. stocks, and yet remain
beyond the reach of the legal systems and intelligence apperatus of the
western world.
It is my vision to create such a system.
Any individual understanding the jargon of intelligence will appreciate
the meaning of this statement.  What is being called for here is the application of the full brunt of intelligence assets and even covert
actions to enforce that which cannot be enforced by law alone.
As do tax attornies, multi-national corporations, wealthy individuals, and
import-export traders.  The United States has become expert in the process
of criminalizing the act of being a criminal.
A dangerous, frightening concept.  Akin to worldwide application of the
RICO act.
And that prudent banker might have been told by the CIA to shut up or take
a walk.
BCCIs problem was that the prosecutors in Miami and the Federal system
never bothered to do any work until the Iran Contra scandal.  This despite
constant allegations and indications of major frauds.
BCCI is a poor example because it involved corrupt bankers who formed the
bank with the intent of defrauding depositors and investors, not a bank
which was merely annoying to the tax authorities of the United States.
Which reality?  That the United States wants access to the financial
records of anyone and everyone on the planet?
Neither are walls, envelopes, whispers or any other manner of secret
keeping.  Correct?  Haven't we seen this before?
If prosecutors would do their job and concentrate on the crimes themselves
as opposed to reforming the entire international financial system to make
their work a bit easier, noone would be concerned.
Financial investigations are a crutch for poor prosecutors.
Jurisdiction over the Manhattan bank, fine.  What are you going to do?

Your observation about the primary point of the list is incorrect in my
view and even if it were correct, you overlook several aspects of the U.S.
taxation system when you class all efforts to reduce or otherwise mitigate
taxation as "tax evasion."
First of all, and as one of the only western powers to do so, the United
States taxes its citizens on _worldwide income_.  While this in itself,
with a proper foreign tax credit system, is not offensive, when the Unites
States adds to this a very wide scope of extraterratorial jurisdiction and
compelled process, it becomes more than tax.  Further, the United States
implements policy it cannot directly legislate constiutionally through
Now, all of the above might not be unusual, but when it is combined with
proposals like the expatraition tax (leave the country and pay a tax for
doing so- and by the way, there is a form of this on the books and
applicable today in the US) and strict money laundering regulations you
approach something like currency controls.
It is also worth noting that your notion of tax evasion is by no means
universal.  Switzerland, Liechtenstein, the Cayman Islands, France, the
United Kingdom, all define tax evasion differently.  Who are you, or
anyone else, to say what tax evasion is, especially when it regards income
derrived outside of the geographical and economic boundries of the taxing
The United States has asked for this problem by imposing a regime of
worldwide taxation on income.  I, for one, am not particularly
Unfortunately, and if you stick with the list long enough and absorb the
ramifications of some of the technology, I think the government has a
losing battle.  At the moment it is estimated that 10% of tax evaders in
the United States are ever caught.
It is partly the arrogance of many U.S. citizens, and the view that their
government knows the one single way to conduct economic and foreign
affairs, that empowers the United States to impose her tax and
economic policy on unconnected sovereigns thousands of miles away.
I think you have a rather narrow view of the list in any event.
Cypherpunks are about much more than the ramifications of new technologies
on the tax systems of the world.  But, if it's sexy to demonize the list
by calling us all tax evaders, feel free.

@_subject: CryptoAnarchy: What's wrong with this picture? 
Well, this is merely one aspect of what I consider "crypto-anarchy" to
Now, how are you going to impose taxes on heads if it becomes impossible
to track down a person?  You have to find them to tax them.  With secure,
anonymous communications, people can exist without giving away their
location, business interests, property holdings, etc...etc...  Travel
taxes?  Well, that's equally difficult to enforce.  Particularly in large
states.  Consider the difficulty of charging $1 for crossing the
Mexican-U.S. border.  Any guesses as to compliance rates there?
The only option for government becomes forcible seizure of land and or
persons to enforce taxation.  Note that even today property in
the United States owned by tax evaders is difficult to seize if
one cannot prove tax evasion.  (Taxation is merely one example of
regulations that become difficult to enforce with proper cryptography in place by the way).
This being so I think it obvious that a manner of market economy among
political systems will emerge.  Some nation states will participate in
what liberal-economists call a "race to the bottom" where they will
continue to reduce regulations and so forth to attract businesses and thus
income.  Those on the far left somehow count this a _bad_ thing, citing typically environmental issues.  It never ceases to amaze me that they
don't get the message when 20% of the corporate population departs and they still don't realize that just raising taxes won't solve the problem.
Essentially this is what the expatriation tax is.  Money is fleeing
because taxes in the United States are offensively high in the view of the
citizens.  I know!  Let's impose regulation forbidding these traitorous
deserters and increasing taxes on them!  Uh huh.  Sure.  I invite those
considering expatriation to consult with me.  While I won't encourage tax
evasion, I can show you, for academic purposes, how impractical the
expatriation tax is to enforce.
Short of closing the economic and physical borders, I'm not quite sure
what you can do.  (Closing the borders is hardly a viable option either).
Much as secret banking emerged, I think it fairly obvious that some nation
states will recognize that they have an interest in deregulating and
charging nearly no tax.  Many already have.  It should come as no
surprise to you that the United States considers these jurisdictions
a threat.  (Note that compliance in low tax jurisdictions approaches
100%).  They will also recognize that they can attract several wealthy
citizens to their shores who will invigorate their local economies if they
pass laws with strict assurances of property rights.
Force is only the answer so long as the population has no other option.  I
think it's fairly clear that nation-states who insist on using draconian
means to enforce taxation in some last ditch effort to bail out their
sinking boats will find their borders are leaking wealth to capital flight
like screen doors.  The only populations left to oppress and collect from
will be those who cannot afford to flee.  Not much left to collect, in
other words.  Not much to collect, a poor and disgruntled population
probably nearing homicidal tendencies (especially in the U.S. example
where a culture of freedom of spirit is less likely to foster much
subserviance to a military type crackdown).  More and more problems at
home, less and less money to deal with it.  Sound like disaster to me.
Now, I don't think its going to happen quite that way.  I think your
assumption that draconian measures are going to be employed so easily is a
incorrect one.
Still, let's assume your correct for a moment.  Are YOU going to stick

It's an informational issue, not a logistical problem.  This much is true.
But think of it this way.  Joe Blow's house burns down, taking with it all
his documentation.  Even Joe Blow has to be able to replace it all even
with no credentials.  So what makes you and Joe Blow distinct when you're
standing in line to get those credentials?  That should give you some idea
of the (lack of) difficulty.
I challenge this assumption.
I applaud your efforts, but the 'one good administrator' can only do so
much.  In the end if people want privacy they have to work for it
themselves.  The goal in my view is to promote an atmosphere where that
kind of self-insurance is possible, not one that puts the responsibility
in the hands of government, or the system administrator.
The nice thing about paranoids, and other privacy invaders, is that when
they have an answer to a question they usually stop looking.  Provide them
with an answer.

@_subject: My nym: Statement 
I thought I would take a moment to discuss my nym, given the Web of Trust
issues floating about right now.
When I developed this nym I hoped to merely avoid connecting my political
views with my real life persona.  Generally speaking many of my
associates, my family and what clients I still serve would find my
political views somewhat distasteful.  It was with a view to prevent this
connection that I originally created the nym on cypherpunks.
As time went by I found it useful for other reasons involving my
previous employer which I won't go into in detail.
Some on the list have met me, either at the cypherpunks meeting in D.C.
when the clipper issue was emerging, or relating to ongoing and emerging
projects.  Others have spoken to me on the phone extensively or briefly.
Really I preserve the nym for reputation capital more than anything else.
I serve the list best with my input (whether you agree with it or not)
when there is some reputation context attached.  Hopefully the majority of
it relates to the perception that I post 'good' material or that I 'have a
clue.'  With any luck some of you are not so quick to delete messages that
bear my address as you would be to delete something from
"nobody at whereever.com."  By the same token, certainly some of you are
burning up the "D" key when I post a lot.  If nothing else a consistant
address helps in filtering.  Those generally interested in my subjects of
expertise and interest will have an extra bit of filtering information
(1=is a black unicorn post) as will those who find my posts annoying.
When I communicate securely it's generally with people who I have some
business or personal dealings with.  This tends to eliminate the need for
me to be extensively interwraped in the web of trust.  Those who don't
know me would be as unwise to send me sensitive mailings as they would be
to cc: fbi.gov.  (At least until "is not a fed" signatures start to become
Because most of my encrypted traffic is of a financial and business nature
I like the overkill of a 2048 bit key.  I also want a published 2048 bit
key in the event it becomes difficult to publically distribute keys in the
The man in the middle problem with my nym is not really an issue as far as
I can tell.  I suppose someone might argue that they wouldn't want to mail
me anything asking for legal advice for fear it might be intercepted and
returned to them with disinformation attached.  As these are people I
generally don't know, it's equally likely to them that I am simply an
agent provocateur who has no man in the middle problems.
- From my end, man in the middle attacks are difficult to use against me
because those with whom I have extensive business and personal
communications know me well enough to permit end to end verification
through seperate secure channels.  (I use secure telephones regularly, and
this permits voice recognition).
"But you could be more than one person..."
So?  Do you like this group's legal and political views?  Then who cares
how many people I am?
I suppose if it makes people happy I will get 10 signatures binding me
strongly to the larger web of trust.  It's never seemed worth the effort

@_subject: CryptoAnarchy: What's wrong with this picture? 
While generally I agree with you, I believe Esper Sata, Gerald Bull and
Pablo Escobar might have more specific disagreements.
While strong cryptography is powerful, and secure communications
liberating, unplugging the phones would about cripple that 'weapon' for a
while.  Any group rebelling based only on high technology communication is
an extremely vulnerable group, both to widespread denial of service, and
more specific 'surgical' attacks.  (Motorola stock anyone?)
Firstly, uprising, even kicking people out of power might take only a
small investment in time and money, but consolidating a new system (even a
decentralized one) will be extensively expensive and time consuming.
To the extent that a successful uprising depends on organizing the new
power structure, I can't see how a successful popular uprising can be
In addition I believe the assumption that a few, even several official
deaths will cause mass resignations ignores history.  See e.g., Columbia,
South Africa, and any number of other examples.
While I understand the point, I think that a slim efficient government is
much better able to resist "contraction."  The most effective covert
action/terrorist/political agitation groups have all been small and
closely held.  It's easier to control all aspects of operation and a
greater concentration can be put into internal security concerns as
government shrinks.  Obviously there is a critical mass, but I don't think
you will see the "runaway refrigerator" effect with government shrinkage.

@_author: Black Unicorn 
@_subject: Attorney-Client / Nyms 
Proposed FRE 503 probably has the best codification of the prevailing
common law on the subject.  I reproduce it in part below.  Typos are mine.
(a) Definitions.  As used in this rule:
(1)  A "client" is a person, public officer, or corporation, association,
or other organization or entity, either public or private, who is rendered
professional legal services by a lawyer, or who consults with a lawyer
with a view to obtaining progessional legal services from him.
(b) General rule of privilege.  A client has a privilege to refuse to
disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosing confidential
communications made for the purposes of facilitiating the rendition of
professional legal services to the client, [between the attorney and the
client directly or indirectly].
(c) Who may claim the privilege.  The privilege may be claimed by the
client [or his agents or assigns etc.]  The person who was the lawyer at
the time of the communication may claim the privilege but only on behalf
of the client.  His authoriety to do so is presumed in the absence of
evidence to the contrary.
(d) Exceptions.  There is no privilege under this rule:
(1) Furtherance of crime or fraud.  If the services of the lawyer were
sought or obtained to enable or aid anyone to commit or plan to commit
what the client knew or reasonably should have known to be a crime or
fraud; or
(2) Claimants through the same deceased client.  As to communication
relevant to an issue between parties who claim through the samed deceased
client, regardless of whether the claims are by testate or intestate
succession or by inter vivos transaction; or
(3) Breach of duty by lawyer or client.  As to a communication relevant to
an issue of breach of duty by the lawyer to his client or by the client to
his lawyer; or
(4) Document attested by lawyer.  As to a communication relevant to an
issue concerning an attested document to which the lawyer is an attesting
witness; or
(5) Joint clients.  As to a communication relevant to matter of common
interest between two or more clients if the communication was made by any
of them to a lawyer retained or consulted in common, when offered in an
action between any of the clients.
Generally speaking the particulars of attorney-client relationships are
regulated by state statute, though some states define the provisions through common law.
Note the confidentiality requirement.  A client is estopped from claiming
privilege if he discloses the content of the communication to a third
party not connected to the attorney-client relationship.
The identity of the client and the existance of the attorney client
relationship are not confidential.  There are some exceptions.
Physical evidence is generally not protected by attorney client privilege
unless it is a manifestation of communications between attorney and client
(letters, documents etc.)
Communications regarding future crimes or frauds are not protected.
What I think you will be most interested in, however are the exception for
stolen property and destruction of evidence.  Stolen property may be held by an attorney for a reasonable time for
inspection purposes, but must be returned to the rightful owner or the
attorney will be a receiver of stolen goods and participating in an
ongoing crime.  Privilege will thus not apply.  In re Ryder, 263 F.Supp.
360 (E.D.Va 1967).  (Some courts will permit the attorney to refuse to
disclose the source from which he obtained the property, however).
Consider this in the context of trade secrets.
All states have laws against destroying or concealing evidence.  The
attorney who advises his client to destroy evidence is a co-consiprator.
Privilege does not apply.  Clark v. State, 261 S.W.2d 339 (Crim. App Tex.
1953).  (Interesting to wonder if advising a client to encrypt evidence is
'concealing' it).
I suggest you use a forwarding service, sign up with your nym name, and
provide the address of a P.O. box for them to forward to, also in the name
of your nym.

Uh.  Hmmmmm.
I refer you to section 877 of the current tax law.
(a)  In General.- Every nonresident alien individual who at any time after
March 8, 1965, and within the 10 year period immediately preceding the
close of the taxible year lost United States citizenship [unless he shows
non-tax avoidance intent with the burden on taxpayer to make such showing]
shall be taxable for such taxable year in the manner provided in
subsection (b)...
(b) Alternate Tax:
[Imposes the larger of normal taxation calculation and the calculation
with the source rules in (c)].
(c)  Special Rules of Source.- For purposes of subsection (b), the
following items of gross income shall be treated as income from sources
within the United States:
[Sale of real property or stocks and debt obligations]
In other words, you get taxed on capital gains and sale of stock or
property as well as real income for 10 years after your expatriation if
you cannot show you renounced citizenship for non-tax purposes.

The reality is that not much will be done, aside some form letters from

you please change it. I suppose that you might have to give it to the IRS if you want a refund,
but why to your employer?  Why not give your employer the wrong number
and correct it directly to the IRS when the IRS complains?
Ditto for your bank.
Almost no one can actually get the number related to your name, only
verify if the number you are using has been issued.
I am continually amazed at the number of people who surrender this number
simply because someone tells them that they have to or the sky will fall

First, Mr. Cate, I appreciate your service, and I think it's a step in the
right direction.  The way that I see it your service is focused on
providing a degree of regulatory arbitrage.  It also seems that the
service is designed, and defended with those purposes in mind.  As far as
I can tell you did and do not intend Offshore Information Services to be a
"Data Haven" in the strict sense of the word.  I recall you stating that
rather specifically, but I may have missed attributation somewhere.
Members of the list should try to take note of this.
Mr. Cate is running a Regulatory Arbitrage Internet Service Provider
(RAISP) not a Data Haven.  To me the distinction is this:
An RAISP seeks to avoid the application of undue reglation by locating in
a jurisdiction where regulation is more limited.
A Data haven seeks to avoid the application of any regulation by
maintaining such secrecy and instant mobility so as to continue to operate
even if authorities bring all their power to bear.
Mr. Cate clearly is in a sensitive position that does not give him the
instant mobility to just jump ship.  He is at the mercy of the authorities
(even if they are laxer than those say in the United States) to the extent
he has no backup plan.  This, by the way, is not a criticism.  This is
entirely consistent with his purpose.
For the RAISP operator, the words "My lawyer tells me that's illegal here"
is the end of the argument.
For the Data Haven operator, the word "My lawyer tells me that's illegal
here" prompts the command "Prepare to make the jump into cyberspace."
I would suggest members of the list reconsider the value of the service
provided by, and the limitations imposed on Mr. Cate.

@_subject: "Utilization Review" 
I listened with horror this evening to a radio program which discussed the state of medical record privacy today.
In one segment a doctor (psychologist) described an experience she had after a session which was covered by the patient's insurance plan.
The doctor in question received a phone message with a 1-800 number and the request to return the call.  On returning it she was connected with a very polite representative of the insurance company (who apparently had some experience in mental health, but not a M.D.) who proceeded to ask the most sensitive questions about the patient's session in order to conduct a "utilization review to determine medical necessity."  Most alarmingly, the representative could be heard typing on a computer during the entire review.
The program went on to indicate that among the provisions in the most recent health insurance reform bill there was a provision for information sharing among insurance companies to facilitate the transfer of insurance policies when the insured switches jobs.  Among the more alarming suggestions in the legislation is the use of a "unique medical identifier."  Many of you will see this coming.  One of the currently proposed "identifiers" is the Social Security Number.
Members of the list might also wish to consider that companies which self insure their employees for health benefits are entitled to all their medical records directly.
The prospect of cradle to grave medical files as an everyday reality in the United States is but around the corner.
In my view it is time for the foundation of an offshore insurance company which recognizes the basic tenant that client medical records are the property of the client, used in a license capacity at the pleasure of the insured, and not an entitlement to which the company is automatically privy.

@_subject: Discussion: The Digital Commerce Clause [Long] [Was: Re: The Commerce Clause and the Crypto Issue] 
Mr. May is fairly close.  If the commerce clause can not be used to
suppress speech it is because there is a constitutional amendment
protecting it.
Practically speaking, the commerce clause is boundless in its grant.
The evolution of Commerce Clause use is one of the most interesting
examples of creeping statism in a western nation that I know of.
Consider the classic view of the Commerce Clause a la Gibbons v. Ogden, 22
U.S. 1 (1824).
[Robert Fulton and Robert Livingston were granted exclusive rights to
operate steamboats in New York waters by the New York Legislature.
Steamboats were a new technology, and the legislation was intended to
encourage investment in the boats.  Fulton and Livingston licensed Ogden
to run a ferry service to New Jersey and Gibbons began to compete.
Gibbon's's ferries were licensed as "vessels in the coasting trade" under
a 1793 piece of legislation enacted by Congress.  Ogden obtained an
injunction in New York, Gibbons appealed.]
Chief Justic Marshall for the majority:
"The subject to be regulated is commerce, and our constitution being, as
was aptly said at the bar, one of enumeration, and not of definition, to
ascertain the extent of the power, it becomes necessary to settle the
meaning of the word.  The counsel for the appellee would limit it to
traffic, to buying and selling, or the interchange of commodities, and do
not admit that it comprehends navigation.  This would restrict a general
term, applicable to many objects, to one of its significations.  Commerce,
undoubtledly, is traffic, but it is something more: it is intercourse.  It
describes the commercial intercourse between nations, and parts of
nations, in all its branches, and is regulated by prescribing rules for
carrying on that intercourse.  The mind can scarcely conceive a system
for regulating navigation, which shall exclude all laws concerning
navigation... and be confined to prescribing rules for the conduct of
individuals, in the actual employment of buying and selling or of
It is not intended to say that these words comprehend that commerce,
which is completely internal, which is carried on between man and man in a
state, or between different parts of the same states, and which does not
extend to or affect other states. [sic]  Such a power would be
inconvenient, and is certainly unnecessary.
Comprehensive as the word 'among' is, it may very properly be restricted
to that commerce which concerns more states than one.  The phrase is not
one which would probably have been selected to indicate the completely
interior traffic of a state, because it is not an apt phrase for that
Justice Johnson:
[Who discusses the history of the state powers over commerce where states
were complete sovereigns and the portion of that power which is delegated
to the federal government.]
[A]n absolute control is given over state legislation on [commerce], as
far as that legislation may be exercised, so as to affect the commerce of
the country.
So as it stands in the day, commerce seems to include buying selling
bartering and transporting good or services between states.  It is the
interaction between states which defines commerce, and the authority to
regulate it stems from the need to prevent one state from "affect[ing] the
commerce of the country."
This is the classic, and (in my view) fairly rational analysis of the
commerce clause.
Use of the commerce clause before the nineteenth century to actually
regulate interstate commerce was limited.  Insteaed Congress concentrated
on programs and legislation to promote economic growth, taking steps, for
example, to create the Bank of the Unted States, transfer public lands to
private citizens, and providing for the national defense.
Some authors note that the aftermath of the Civil war created many of the
circumstances which made a more expansive view of the commerce clause
appealing.  For example, it is argued, the increasing success of the
national economy made it more obviously interdependent and that localized
problems increasingly became national problems.  One might consider the
period of Reconstruction, where the rights of newly freed slaves were not
adequately protected by southern state governments.  The case for national
intervention was fairly compelling in this example.  Theories of
federalism began to emerge which expanded the role of the federal
government and balloned the catagories of issues which fell into the
definition of "nationally impacting."  Many theorists use the Civil War
itself as a vindicating example of the concept that national power could
be used to "enforce" freedom.  (For larger views of these theories and the
historical context often used to support them, See Generally, H. Hyman, A
More Perfect Union (1973); R. Harrison, The Weakened Spring of Government
Revisited: The Growth of Federal Power in the Late Nineteenth Century, in
The Growth of Federal Power in American History (R. Jeffreys-Jones & B.
Collins eds. 1983).
Some of the period's legislation reflects the new attitude, the
Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 and the Sherman Antitrust act of 1880 are
classic examples.  These more active measures of regulation did, however,
produce a growing group of citizens sensitive to the growing national
powers.  Many commentators note that the groups objecting to national
legislation could provide very concrete examples why the congressional
acts hampered freedom and economic growth, while proponents of the acts
were limited to untested concepts of national economy, and theory.
Federalist based objections to these legislative inititives forced the
development of legal theories to address the concrete examples.  Note that
this period also began the currently obvious trend of promoting social
goals viewed "as valuable wholly apart from their relation to economic
These approaches are generally lumped into the "formal" and "realist"
realms.  Consider first, United States v. E.C. Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1
[The United States used the Sherman Act to set aside the acquisition by
the American Sugar Refining Company of four competing refineries.  The
aquisition left only one independent refinery in operation which produced
2 percent of the sugar refined in the country.  Chief Justice Fuller held
that the Sherman Act did not reach this monopoly because the Constitution
did not allow Congress to regulate "manufacturing."  The government had
argued that such concentrated manufacturing power constituted a monopoly
over a necessity of life which was enjoyed by a large population of the
United States which necessarily required resort to interstate commerce.
Fuller replied that "this argument cannot be confied to necessaries of
life merely, and must include all articles of general consumption.
Doubtless the power to control the manufacture of a given thing involves
in a certain sense the control of its disposition, but this is a
secondary and not the primary sense; and although the exercise of that
power may result in bringing the operation of commerce into play, it does
not control it, and affects it only incidently and indirectly.  Commerce
succeeds manufacture, and is not a part of it.
In Fuller's view, it would be "far-reaching" to permit a federal action
"whenever interstate or international commerce may be ultimately affected.
The fact that an article is manufactured for export to another state does
not of itself make it an article of interstate commerce, and the intent of
the manufacturer does not determine the time when the article or product
passes from the control of the state and belongs to commerce."  Fuller
continued, noting that a monopoly in manufacture might restrain interstate
commerce but that this was an indirect result and therefore American
Sugar's action "bore no relation" to interstate commerce.
Justice Harlan dissented, arguing that a monopoly that "obstructs freedom
in buying and selling articles" to be sold outside of the state of
manufacture "affects, not incidently, but directly, the people of all the
States."  In Harlan's view, "Whatever improperly obstructs the free course
of interstate intercourse and trade, as involved in the buying and selling
of articles to be carried from one state to another, may be reached by
congress."  To Harlan congress was merely, "prevent[ing] the coming into
existence of combination, the purpose or tendency of which was to impose
unlawful restraints upon interstate commerce."
E.C. Knight Co. through Fuller, demonstrates nicely the "formal" view.
The line of interstate commerce is drawn quite finely.  Indirect effects
are ignored.
The realist view, as expressed by Harlan, looks instead to the effect on
economy, the actual impact, or the intent of congress.
Concepts like the "stream of commerce" (Congress may regulate an activity
if it affects interstate commerce.  Taft in Stafford v. Wallace, 258 U.S.
495 (1922)., and the "current of commerce" (Swift and Co. v. United
States 196 U.S. 375 (1905)), began to form to facilitate the expansion of
the reach of the commerce clause in the early 1900s.
The court was a bit muddled about its approaches from the 1890's or so
until the 1920's but the result was a great deal of flexibility in
assessing the constitutionality of congressional statutes by the time the
1930's arrived.
In 1933 Franklin D. Roosevelt took office.  Addressing the crippled
economy, the new president fostered a host of legislation, unprecidented
in number and power.  Enter: The New Deal.
Consider the comments of one scholar: "Much of the legislation interfered
with what many had come to regard as the prerogatives of private property,
and, incidently, the proper domain of the states.  The New Deal statutes
were sure to generate challenges to their constitutionality.  Supporters
could draw on a complex, well-developed, and not entirely coherent body of
law regarding the extent of Congress's power to regulate interstate
Some of the first challenges arrived in the mid 1930's in the form of
Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502 (1934); Norman v. Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad, 294 U.S. 240 (1935) (upholding the repudiation of contractual
duties to repay debts in gold) and Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S.
388 (1935).  Only Panama Refining succeeded as a challenge to legislation,
invalidating portions of the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933
which some commentators consider the conceptual centerpiece of the New
More blows to the New Deal followed in the form of A. L. A. Schecter
Poultry Corp v. United States 295 U.S. 495 (1935); Carter v. Carter Coal
Co., 298 U.S. 238 (1936).
At the time of the Schecter decision, the act in question was about to
expire, and the administrative approach to its enforcement was becoming
less and less popular.  Schecter was, therefore, probably more important
for its approach than its actual result.  Consider Justice Hughes, for the
"The undisputed facts thus afford no warrant for the argument that the
poultry handled by defendants at their slaughterhouse markets was in a
'current' or 'flow' of interstate commerce and was thus subject to
congressional regulation.  The mere fact that there may be a constant flow
of commodities into a states does not mean that the flow continues after
the property has arrived and has become commingled with the mass of
property within the state and is there held solely for local dispotion and
"If the commerce clause were construed to reach all enterprises and
transactions which could be said to have an indirect effect uipon
interstate commerce, the federal authority would embrace practically all
the activites of the people and the authority of the state over its
domestic concerns would exist only by sufference of the federal
government.  Indeed, on such a thoery, even the development of the
state's commercial facilities would be subject to federal control.
"If the federal government may determine the wages and hours of employees
in the internal commerce of a state, because of their relation to cost and
prices and their indirect effect upon interstate commerce, it would seem
that a similar control might be exerted over other elements of costs, also
affecting prices, such as the processes of production and distribution
that enter into cost could likewise be controlled.  If the cost of doing
an intrastate business is in itself the permitted object of federal
control, the extent of the regulation of cost would be a question of
discretion and not of power."
So we find the court rejecting a strictly "realist" approach and guarding
certain "wholly local" activites from the reach of congression regulation
by insisting on a "formalist" reading.
One may note the attitude of the majority in Carter as demonstrative of
the protectiveness the court was showing toward local activity.  Consider
Justice Sutherland for the majority:
"Every journey to a forbidden end begins with the first step and the
danger of such a step by the federal governmnet in the direction of taking
over the powers of the states is that end of the journey may find the
states so despoiled of their powers, or-- what may amount to the same
thing-- so relieved of the responsibilities which possession of the powers
necessarily enjoins, as to reduce them to little more than geographical
subdivisions of the national domain."
These cases, along with United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1 (1936);
Morehead v. New York ex rel Tipaldo, 298 U.S. 587 (1936), and the
landslide victory by FDR hatched a cunning plan.  Thwarted by the Supreme
Court in serious ways, FDR proposed certain "changes" in the structure of
the court.  Essentially Roosevelt proposed that one justice be added for
each justice over 70 who refused to resign or retire.  This would bring
the number of justices up to fifteen, and secure a safe majority on the court for the New Deal supporters.
The rational was the the older justices were increasing the workload on
the younger justices because they were unable to properly see to their
During debate on the proposal Justice Van Devanter left the Court and the
Court upheld a state minimum wage state in West Coast Hotel Co. v.
Parrish, 200 U.S. 379 (1937).  Justice Roberts, formerly a New Deal
opponent had switched his vote in West Coast.  This last minute alteration
was dubbed "The switch in time that saved Nine."
It should also be noted that the majority leader of the Senate, Joseph
Robinson, exerted a great deal of pressure on the Senate and personal
pressure on individual Senators and was believed by many to have
accumulated the required votes for the court packing plan.  Robinson died
of a heart attack however before the vote was taken and the plan was
rejected.  Personally, I am amazed that conspiracy buffs have not latched
on to this piece of history.  See Generally, Leuchtenberg, The Origins of
Franklin D. Roosevelt's Court Packing Plan, 1966 Sup. Ct. Rev 347.
One might also want to take into account the increasing power communists
were showing in the United States.  Several commentators have pointed out
that without the "concessions" of The New Deal, the United States might
well have faced a sudden and potent turn to socialism or communism
The result, however, was a suddenly pro-New-Deal court.  Witness Justice
Hughes in NLRB v. Jones and Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1 (1937):
"Although activites may be intrastate in character when separtely
considered, if they have such a close and substantial relation to
interstate commerce that their control is essential or appropriate to
protect that commerce from burdens and obstructions, Congress cannot be
denied the power to exercise that control."
and the outer limits of the commerce clause:
Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942)
[The Agricultural Adjustment Act allowed the Secretary of Agriculture to
set a quota for wheat production.  Each wheat grower was given an
allotment.  Filburn was a dary farm owner in Ohio.  He also raised small
amounts of wheat for his livestock and for making flower at home, for seed
purposes, and for sale.  His quota was 222 bushels, but he instead yielded
461 and was fined $117.  Fulburn sued to enjoin enforcement arguing,
among other issues, that his entiely local use and consumption of wheat
for his own family use was beyond the reach of Congressional Legislation.]
Justice Jackson:
"The Court's recognition of the relevance of the economic effects in the
application of the Commerce Clause has made the mechanical application of
legal formulas no longer feasible.  Once the economic measure of the reach
of the power granted to Congress in the commerce clause is accepted,
questions of federal power cannot be decided simply by finding the
activity in question to be "production," nor can consideration of the
economic effects be foreclosed by calling them "indirect"...
...even if appellee's activity be local and though it may not be regarded
as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by congress if
it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce and this
irrespective of whether such effect is what might at some earlier time
have been defined as "direct" or "indirect..."
That appelee's own contribution to the demand for wheat may be trivial by
itself is not enough to remove him from the scope of federal regulation
where, as here, his contribution taken together with that of many others
similarly situated, is far from trivial."
Now we see the extreme edges of the commerce clause.  Even individual
acts, which alone are not sufficent to impact interstate commerce, may in
their aggregate be seen to impact it.  Congress thus can reach the most
local acts.
As a result, the commerce clause has become a quick and easy clause to
rely upon when congress is attempting to impose its rule over what may
appear to be "local activities."  Civil rights legislation rested on the
commerce clause as its authority, typically by arguing that privately
owned estlablishments affected interstate commerce by e.g., their
proximity to an interstate and the interstate makeup of their clients.
It is worth noting that since the Wickard case, and until the year before
last, no challenge based on commerce clause authority has suceeded.  (The
only case I know of involves the regulation of firearms possession in
school zones and spurred some news stories last year).
Without a doubt.
Extremely difficult.
As you can see, the commerce clause is deeply entrenched.  Direct and
indirect effects on commerce between the states are easily enough to reach
the questioned activity.
I think there is no doubt in the world that digital commerce will DIRECTLY
impact interstate and foreign commerce from a legal point of view.  If my
growing wheat in my back yard does, you can bet the farm that new means of
conducting business and making transactions across state boarders will.
I hate to differ with Mr. May, but I think that deflecting or derailing
this aspect of congressional authority to regulate is all but hopeless in
light of cases like Wickard and that our efforts are best directed
Now I know some list member will mail me asking how I can support the
crushing grip congress has on the citizens of the United States and the
States themselves.  I do hope that member will re-read my post carefully
before pecking out that letter.
I believe the answer to preserving the purity of digital commerce is to
form it in such a way so as to make regulation impossible, because in my
view the constitution no longer provides citizens with the protection or
freedom to progress.  I feel the same way about privacy.  All the
constitutional arguments in the world mean little today.  A systematic
approach which makes violations of personal rights impossible whether
constitutional or not is the answer.
I see digital commerce burdened by regulations possessed of the character
of money laundering, reporting requirements and due dilligence statutes.
All of these are already entrenched, and there is literally ZERO chance of
prevailing in a challenge based on the illegitimacy of the commerce clause
in these cases.
("The cash is dead, long live the king.")
Cypherpunks should do what cypherpunks do best.  Write code, implement big
brother proof systems and make them entrenched before they are legislated
away.  There are always creative ways to make laws which take away rights.
You can't, however, legislate away mathamatics.

I was quite serious.  I find it immensely entertaining and valueable.  Mr. Metzger in many ways, perhaps unwittingly, perhaps by design, forces the list to evaluate and consider how wide the scope of crypto actually reaches.  Everytime he asks "what does this have to do with crypto" he tends to be responded to with some quite creative and original connections (and some not so creative or original).  Everytime Mr. May points out arguments for wider topicality the reverse is true for the code purists.  Discourse.  Extremely valuable in my view.  I'll refrain from commenting on Mr. Hettinga's comment.
Mr. May takes my point the wrong way.  Again, I was quite literal.  I think the conflict is the best thing since crosstalk.  It hits right on the money as to what this list is about from two extremely opposed parties, one with a more liberal (literal, not political) view as to what is on topic, and one with a more conserative (again, literal, not political) view.  As to my own Netscape rantings, well, I'll leave that without comment too.
As I state above, I think the argument is a long running theme for which Mr. May and Mr. Metzger are the opposing camp figureheads.  I wouldn't call your discussions "flame wars" (with the possible exception of the occasional low barb by Mr. Metzger) at all.
Again, I was pointing out the value and interest of the specticle, not its lack of merit.  It is my view that empassioned discourse is among the most devine of human expressions, but then, legal education tends to indoctrinate that view.

This method is so dependent on the uniformity of the initiator (the cap in this instance) as to be nearly useless.  Normal blasting caps do not detonate with the uniformity required to initiate each of the tube paths at the same time.  In the off chance that you contemplated surrounding the cap with liquid explosive of a sufficent type, (which still wouldn't assure proper uniformity with any certainty as the liquid explosive is as likely to detonate slightly off left to right as up to down) you still have extremely difficult problems to overcome.
1>  Interference from the milling shape and accuracy of the openings to the tubes containing the liquid explosive.
2>  Mild to obscure impurities in the liquid explosives causing differences in velocity with respect to other tubes.  Even small changes in pressures within the tubes might cause enough timing problems to make uniform initiation of the primary high explosive assembly impossible.
3>  Interference from the milling shape and accuracy of the terminus of the tubes containing the liquid explosive.
4>  Overpressure in the device causing premature detonation of the near portion of the high explosive assembly.
All of these might cause enough timing error to prevent uniform pressure and thus prevent uniform compression and make supercriticality impossible.
Remember, kryonic switiches are necessary even when dealing with the speeds of electric conductivity.  The velocities of even hydrazine based explosives are signigicantly lower.  The margin for error is similarly lower.
Plutonium gun is still the easiest method for the home grown nuclear device, even if it requires more fissile material.

Way off topic, still....
[easy nuclear initiation device described, key in design are:]
To which I reply:
You, quite inadvertantly I am sure, managed to ignore the following:
And thus boast:
Actually, your design still is vulnerable to my objection, as my objection was specifically to your intermediary chamber concept.
Your intermediary chamber, if surrounding the blasting cap, is likely to detonate to one side first, at a right angle to the axis of the chamber to the explosive assembly.  Blasting caps tend to rupture their casings on one side before the other.  In this case you will have a left to right detonation in the intermediary chamber, as I indicated.  If you have your tubes spun off the chamber like a starfish, your initiation times will vary, probably significantly.  In the worst case, the duration determined by diameter of chamber/velocity of detonation.  In the event your chamber is 1/5 of the length of the tubes themselves, you will have one side of your explosive assembly detonating when another tube has 1/5 a length to go.  As you have not specified any of the dimentions of your chamber or tubes, or the exact liquid explosive you intend to use, the delay is impossible to quantify exactly.  Attempting to mitigate the delay by shortening the tubes brings the explosive assembly closer to the intermediary chamber, with associated hazards.  Most problematic, disruption of the reflector orientations.
Also note, that if starfished, the worst possible timing error will occur, that being, the tubes with the most extreme difference in initiation time will be those at opposite poles of the quasi-sphere of the explosive assembly.  Bad news for uniform compression.
If you intend to run the intermediary chamber into a funnel before seperating into your individual tubes, you have the same problem as if you never had a chamber at all, namely the initiation of one or the other tubes before the rest.  While the funnel may limit the effect of radial differences in initiation timing, it complicates things by requiring very precise milling of the connections of the tubes to the intermediary chamber as well as such milling at the ends which meet your explosive Clever question given that I am without any information as to the exact shape of your tubes, if they are bowled down towards the explosive assembly, or what their exact width (excepting your vague 1mm figure) might be.  You make some guesses as to material, but these two are fairly flimsy even by your own admission.
All you need to realize to appreciate the problem is that if you do not have a precisely milled end, with a precise depth into the compressing high explosive outer face, you have differences in how and when the various faces of the explosive assembly are going to initiate.  If you make your tubes narrow, it becomes very hard to mill the ends of your tubes, and if you widen the tubes, it exagerates the distortive effect of irregularities in the tube ends.
It's very simple, if you don't have a precisely flat end of tube, you have a shaped charge in effect.  On the other end, you have problems with easy of initiation.
  (Hint:  If you seriously I'm not in the business of designing nuclear initiators.  I expose poorly thought out explosive engineering as a hobby.  Your best solution is to mill each tube exactly alike, right down the the degree of bend and slope of arc as well as shape of either end.  But you could have figured that out without me spelling it our for you.
Hard to prevent with a hydrazine explosive.  Hydrazine based explosives may vary as much as 10-15% in velocity of detonation with mere .1% changes in pressure and 1% changes in temp.  I don't know how impurity comes into play exactly, but I suspect they are very sensitive to such changes as well.
What is the mass of your subcritial material?  What shape are you using?  Simple sphere or multifaceted polygon?  What is the thickness of your compressive explosive?  What kind of explosive is it?  How deep are the initiators inserted into the compressive explosive?  What is the material of your tubes?  Glass or metalic?  (Metalic will be force conductive before failure, glass will merely shatter, the difference in initiation points in the compressive explosive will be equal to the depth of the tubes when comparing glass and metalic tubes.  Glass is likely to initiatite at the surface, metalic tubes at the point of tube terminus.
You might have signifincantly different characteristics in the initiation of your compressive explosive.  As I said before, anything but a precisely milled flat end on your tubes will effectively be a shaped charge.
The effects of various shapes at the ends of tubes are left as an exercise for the reader.
Quite.  It was a big problem in the first compressive devices.  Some early experimentation produced mushroom like shapes in the compressed material (inert for experimentation) because one side of the compressive explosive was initiated by presure of the impact of the casing itself.  Supercriticality would not have been achieved in these instances of Further experimentation attempted to rectify the problem by placing the entire inner chamber at .25 of an atmosphere.  I think their eventual solution got around overpressure initiation in a simplier way, but I don't recall what it was.  (Might have been new explosives for the compression phase)
But they don't.  The timing problem is quite significant.  Why do you think high speed and superaccurate switches are so well guarded?  There isn't an easy grassroots substitute, if there were, the switches would be fairly useless.
Again, I don't know what your dimentions are.  Hydrazine explosives tend to detonate around 8500-10000 m/s.  The speed of transmission of electric impulses through a given conductive medium is certainly much higher.
You are correct this time.  My fault.  Uranium should have been in there.  Typo on my part.  Doesn't change the fact that it's much easier as an initiator.
Hey, be my guest.  If you had a critical mass worth of plutonium you're playing around with the wrong list, and, I might add, wasting your time with anything but the black market for the material.

This will be my last reply on the subject.
Then you still have the problem of the connection of the exceedingly thin tube to your starfish/wagon wheel where the individual tubes branch off to the compressive explosive assembly.  This puts you right back to square one, the need to mill these connections with exceedingly close Considering that you never discussed the specifics of blasting caps or the manner in which they might influence your design, I think the safe assumption is that you never thought of it.  Your paragraph above is poor spin control in that regard.
This is name dropping.  The reader will notice the need to bolster credibility by association with a "big" name.  The conclusions are obvious.
I decided The reader will notice now how the author has gone from associating with the "big" name to being superior to the "big" name.  The intent is to bolster holed credibility even further.  This tactic will be recognized by the astute political observer as "link and exceed."  (Most often used with our favorate "big" name, JFK.
Without more on your shape and size of the core, its essentially impossible to say what timing difference will be debilitating.  I did infact give an example related to fractions of the branch tube lengths.  Without more from you, the supposed originator of the idea, no one can tell you how much timing error is enough.  The answer in general form is:  Enough to cause the center shape to displace enough of it's mass away from the direct brunt of force from the opposed charge.  Most excessively, some of the branch tubes might fail to initiate all together.  The quantity of all this depends so specifically on the type of explosive used for the compression, the exact density of your core, the number of facets you use in your compressive assembly and the location of initiation on the facets so as to be entirely useless without precise details.  What I can tell you is that it's enough of a problem to make high speed precise switches necessary.  Be real, if the timing problem was enough to make even normal resistance matching a problem, how the hell are you going to solve it with a much more volitle and violent initiation method?
[additional paranoid rantings intended to bolster the authors image by substitute knowledge deleted]
I did that with the example related to tube length. (Which you quite cleverly deleted)  I'm hardly going to sit down and do models of shaped explosive dynamics and hydraluic shock analysis simply to tell you you're way off.  If your so interested, examine the problem yourself.
  Again, the fact that you have never What you were and are aware of is a matter for significant speculation, complicated by your characterization of shape charge analysis (especially with liquid explosive) as "rudimentary analysis."
But since you haven't tested it, and don't plan to, we can't know can we?  Moreover, since your design was only marginally if ever interested in these problems, one has to assume you're way off the ball.  Your 10ns accuracy figure is pulled right out of the air and in no way represents a figure you know you can obtain.  I don't believe such accuracy can be obtained with this kind of physical inititation.  I'm not telling you to stop trying, you can do what you like.  I will, however, expose your oversights in order to facilitate reputation capital distribution by the list.  (To which I now apologize for the massive spam).
[You keep saying that, (I already anticipated this.) I'm not quite sure you know how much you sound like an apologist]
  If it's the Oh, whatever.  Get a grip.  These paranoid rantings intended to deflect and distract from the main failings in your design are more than obvious.
No, they are just the simpliest liquid explosives to obtain and make, and happen to have the highest detonation velocities.  I assumed you would be using them.  Perhaps I overestimated the depth of your thought on this When I make them, I admit them.
As I said before, the degree of your expertise and wisdom is the primary issue in debate.

No.  It was not assumed that the victim would take special notice of the phone call, or certainly not enough to bother to try and track the signal realtime BEFORE accepting the phone.  Hence, crypto is serious overkill.
The phone was given to a trusted traitor, a call comes in, trusted agent tells hapless victim that he should talk to this person, caller estlablishes that this is the target by voice or otherwise, then hits e.g., the pound key, which triggers the explosive concealed in the battery.
The charge was shaped to deliver the most available force into the ear.  Not much explosive is required for such an application.
DTMF dialing.  It may also have been a special frequency not available from the keypad, but I don't believe so.

Unfortunately what he did was take the emphasis away from personal empowerment and personal responsibility for privacy and put it at the mercy of some creed or moral stand which had:
1> No common calling or degree of obervance in the population, or the intelligence communities at the time.
2> No structure, legal or otherwise, to provide for its enforcement.
3> The rather disturbing impication that no one need take pains to hide their private exchanges because a moral standard would protect them.
Instead, at least I always thought, cypherpunks stand for the personal empowerment and personal assurance of privcacy.
Indeed everything I can think of discussed here seems to revolve around a single goal-  making it easier, and simpler for a person to protect him or herself from unwanted intrusion into data he or she wishes to protect.  In fact, some goals, especially where transparency is concerned, seem to take the even more cynical view that the general population would be better off protected by crypto whether they know it or not.
Making crypto widely available to the general population, reviewing crypto for its implementation, basic skepticism about the protection afforded by new systems, basic skepticism for systems produced for commercial gain, basic skepticism for government produced systems, arguments for the lessening of government involvement in crypto, crypto standards, and a powerful dislike for the regulation of communication in all forms.  Perhaps most importantly, the production, review and discussion of "grass roots" crypto and communications security code.
All these, common themes on the list in my view, push us away from some blind notion that all is well in the world, and that man is basically good and will not intrude on his fellows.  All these insist that man is curious, probing, and that information is by its very nature nearly impossible to restrain without powerful methods.  All these insist that information will be exposed, be it by accident, malice, theft, by hook or by crook, or even well intentioned discourse, unless protected.  Isn't this the objection to ITAR?  It is folly to try and restrain information by legislation.
It should be clear that it is dangerous to depend on anything, be it government, industry, Lotus Notes, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, your best friend's promise, your wife's pillow talk, and least of all a misplaced faith in the decency of the common man, when your sensitive data is at issue.
In short, crypto helps those who help themselves to crypto.
I have no sympathy what-so-ever for those who lose the privacy of their data through negligence.  I believe they should be estopped from all complaint.  I believe they are great fools.  Moreover, I note that almost without exception, they try to place the cost of their missteps on the world at large, and the responsibility for policing privacy in the hands of others.  "It was not my fault that I left the letter sitting on my desk knowing that the spy convention was about to walk in," they whine, "Someone should DO something about all this immoral letter reading.  There ought to be a LAW.  How can >I< be expected to stop all these spies?"
Is it not clear that allowing this mentality to persist is an unwise and  dangerous thing?
"Gentlemen do not read other's mail," while noble, clever, and a wonderful bit of public relations, ignores the basic reality of the modern age.  There are few gentlemen anymore, and even those occasionally stumble upon something they might not be entitled to examine.
Not only is crypto smart, but it distributes the (increasingly small) costs of protecting data properly.  It puts the burden on the least cost avoider, and the individual with the best access to full information.  "What is this data worth?  What would exposing it cost me?  How much is it worth to spend protecting this data?"  Who better to answer these questions than the owner of the data?  How easier to protect it than by the negliagable cost of encrypting it?
Not only does placing the burden of data protection on Government or society at large miscalculate and misplace the incentives for the protection of the data, it also places the selection of degree and method of protection on the wrong party as well.
In the end it also causes an undue amount of waste.
When Mr. May indicates that he does not use PGP very often because he finds it too much trouble to use for most mail, he is part of a process that in the aggregate must save millions of hours and dollars.  He is making a decision that data X is only worth an expenditure of Y to protect, and that PGP represents an expenditure higher than Y.  Expenditure Y is thus saved, as would be unlikely in a government program.
Who among us would argue that government, the phone company, or the church would better make this judgment?
I would bemoan a world where gentlemen actually never read each other's mail.  Such a world would be so vulnerable to the "first market entry" into the business of mail reading as to be almost beyond salvage.  A certain First Minister of France comes to mind who, by his non-observance of the religious restricitons of the day and his alliance with traditional enemies of the Church, reduced Germany to 250 years of fragementation and assured that, for a time, France was the greatest power on earth.  "If there is a God," it was said of him, "the minister has much to account for.  If not, well, he had a good life."
The evil snooping man is hero from one perspective.  He is the incentive to be risk averse.  He is the skeptic who says that the market is not efficient and bets against it and so makes it efficient once more.  Moral utopia of the kind that would see no peeping tom's is a fantasy, and the evil man a-plenty saves us from Germany's fate.
So then we should brand Mr. Stimpson as a fool, and a liar.  Or at best, perhaps a convert who realized quickly (or not so quickly) the error of his ways and fell into proper line in his later embrace of signals intelligence.
At the very least we might apply a less optimistic creed.

Given the cost of high bandwidth connections and the practical necessity
of surrendering control of the actual machine on which the server resides
to have a decent connection at all, it seems to me that this possibility
should be very seriously considered.
It will allow virtual anonyminity of browsing and (with cooperative ISPs)
allow anonymous maintaince of a page itself.
The other alternative (maintaining control of the server and machine
itself) requires substantially more work to foil traffic analysis and
jurisdictional savvy employment to achieve the same effect.
As usual, the mathamatic defense vastly exceeds the utility of the
physical defense.
To what extent will it be possible, e.g., to run a financial services web
page from a server and still keep the server staff from knowing what the
page is?
It provides the ISP providing the server with liability protection, and
presents many more anonymous possibilities.
This, clearly, must be the best answer to turning web pages and WWW
transactions into the kind of personal and private exchanges that PGP
affords e-mail today.

@_subject: anonymous mailing lists 
I think that traffic analysis can be best defeated by powerful filtering
rather than any kind of multiple sending.
Eventually, (as the number of messages to a particular party increases
beyond the number of distractor messages sent with each mailing) it will
be possible to note the statistical difference in the number of messages
send to the random 20 people and the actual recipiant.  A mail bombing
will still reveal the true identity of the addressee as the 20 distractor
address will be randomly selected each time, and the addressee will not.
Instead, one might suggest, the same 20 people should be sent to as
distractors.  Unfortunately this leaves the actual addressee open to
disclosure when he/she responds to alpha forwarded messages (you were
assuming all internet traffic would be monitored, thus the response timing
would be a major clue).
I think the real answer to this is going to be open access pools.  All
encrypted messages will be left in a collective pop account, accessable by
anyone at all.  An agent could easily be written to poll the pop account,
download the entire queue of messages and locally decode and make
available only the ones addressed to the addressee.
I suspect the best policy would be to purge the pop account once a month
of messages older than 2 months.
Traffic analysis will reveal who polls the pop account, but not much else.
I suppose this could even work today if someone wrote a clever agent to
poll alt.anonymous.messages.

Careful, the FBI only does counter-intel in this context.
Again, why was the FBI putting the informant into Intel?  It was almost
100% certain to be related to a criminal or counter-intel matter.  The
fact that the informant may have appropriated information in the process
and sold it to the highest bidder is a rebuke against the FBI's informant
selection process, not against economic or industrial espionage, which the
FBI does not do.
It has gained a great deal of notice, you just have to know where to look.
I suggest looking over e.g., the economist, foreign affairs, foreign
policy, the international journal of intelligence and counterintelligence,

"ecspionage" (A silly and non-sensical term even if you were constructing
it correctly here).
See my comment above.

@_subject: What remains to be done. 
Because I am not myself much of a programer, and because I have to find
excuses to feel useful, I thought I would annoy everyone with my ideas
about where c'punks might want to direct their efforts at encryption
Of course any suggestion at direction tends to require a disclosure of the
assumptions one is working from.  The following are mine:
1.  The most interesting crypto uses and implementations seem to come from
grassroots programers, not large organizations.
Remailers, PGP, Curve Encrypt, Private Idaho, mixmaster, premail, and
magic money all were the results of "grassroots" efforts.  None of these
have been produced from massive corporate R and D programs, and most have
been the result of predominately a single programmer's efforts.
2.  The most useful crypto applications out there have tended to survive
by using crypto that looks forward, not to the past, or the present.  This
is generally manifest in the inclusion or easy use of multiple methods.
Zimmerman's selection of IDEA over DES, PGP's multiple key sizes, Curve
Encrypt's 3DES/IDEA option, are all examples of an effort to design
systems which will be useful tommorow, not just today.  PGPlib seems to
pick up this trend where PGP 2.x went awry.
3.  In so far as proliferation is important, the impact of crypto
applications and implementations is directly tied to ease of use.
If PGP has failings, one must be that it can be immensely intimidating to
the novice.  4.  Increasingly cryptography is defying attempts at conventional
5.   will eventually spur sovereigns to rather drastic methods to defy
6.  Secure Communications, and transparent crypto are a Good Thing.
Assuming the above, I think it is apparent that crypto development should
be focused on a few general points and a few key areas.
As to general points, I think the clear concentrations include:
A.  Increasing the ease of use.
Perhaps I should have put this as  because really among those things
which I suggest in this post, I think this is of primary importance.  It
cannot be stressed enough that encryption must be transparent, easy to
use, but at the same time make its presence just apparent enough to
encourage its use, and to make users note its absence.
Crypto will have its most significant impact, its most liberating results,
and be self assuring only to the extent that it is not a novelty, but an
Please, authors, coderpunks, make crypto easy to use, but flexible enough
so that adept and expert users can modify functional aspects.  (Key
generation, key size, exponent size, algorithm selection, level of
verbosity and suchlike should find their way into an expert menu
B.  Multiple encryption method support/larger key sizes.
While I may be more paranoid than some, or even most, I think it is
crucial to provide for the possibility that strong encryption may one day
face a total ban in more countries.  To avoid the chilling effect that
this would certainly have on development, it is of key importance to
permit applications and implementations to nexus with several methods, and
to allow what may today seem like extrodinarily large key sizes.  (256
bits would not be unreasonable in my view, particularly so where the user
was given the option of selecting a ~128 or so bit method like IDEA or
3DES at their option (consistent with A. above).
C.  Anonymous communication.
I'm not sure this needs much explanation.
D.  True stego.
Today it is a simple matter to identify encrypted traffic.  This is the
key flaw in what I will call (at risk of sounding like a white paper) the
NEI (National Encryption Infrastructure).  It subjects users to very
effective and easy to implement traffic analysis.  While I understand the
temptation to use checksum like methods to speed the key checking process,
at some point I am of the view that this convenience will come back to
haunt crypto.
Given these areas, what specific applications might be the best to look
into for the grassroots crypto advocate/coder?
A.  Methods to run secure websites on insecure servers.
A thread on 'punks last month, I am of the view that local decryption of
web pages is essential to the development of coercion free web pages.
Estlablishing a truely secure web page today requires the server to be
extra-terratorial, in a secure physical location, and requires such
lengths to defeat traffic analysis (which lengths must be applied to the
actual network logistics, rather than the software logistics) so as to be
impractical to all but institutional resources.  The best effort I have
seen is in European Union Bank ( or ( [neither of
which I recommend you use for deposits] and it still falls quite short.
A software solution which permits local decryption makes traffic analysis
less useful, presents the opportunity to use front end and disposable www
pages on domestic ISPs while imposing no liability on the ISP itself, and
opens several more effective traffic analysis deterants.
Ideally, both web proxies (for servers as well as clients) and local
decryption will be written allowing both server and user a degree of
double blind operation as well as easy disposability of front ends.
A Netscape plugin for local decryption of web pages and proxy forwarding
of WWW form submissions to the server is a MUST.
Is anyone considering work on these?
B. More effective message pools.
Really this is the only practical and most effective method to defeat
traffic analysis of e-mail communications.  Why do you think it is that
informants always communicate with the FBI in the classified ads?
This has been discussed again and again, yet I am aware of no serious
effort to construct an effective server or client to implement it more
effectively than USENET (which seems to be hopelessly slow and prone to
drop postings regularly)
I am encouraged by the new mixmaster model, but I have yet to read the
entire abstract carefully.
If the goal is, as I believe it should be, to make encryption accessible
and understood by, if not everyman and joe sixpack, joe digitalsixpack,
then it strikes me that the focus should be on WWW browsers and servers,
(Netscape like material), popular mailing programs (Eudora), and the
building blocks of the network, the point of origin, and the point of
final destination.
Point to point, grassroots plug ins to existing de facto standards, and
ease of use, ease of use, ease of use.

@_subject: What remains to be done. 
I was concerned with an entirely different problem really.
Given the assumption that you and three of your best friends wish to use
WWW to share information, how can you do so without exposing the page
to the ISP?
Today, as far as I know, if you wish to hide what you have on a page you
have to control the server.  If you wish to try and deter traffic analysis
you have to own the servers in front of the server.  Cumbersome,
expensive and still not entirely effective.
If instead you could prevent the owner of the server from reading the
stuff in the first place, while allowing it to be read at leasure by the
It would also be much easier to construct remailer type proxies in that
each server in the chain would be denied the content of data passing
What I am hoping can be done is to stretch the points in "point to point
encryption" out past the ISP.
Now, if your concern is exposure by a member you have given access to the
webpage, the discussion becomes an issue of certification, and signatures.
An important point, but something of an overkill where the ISP has full
access to your webpage whatever your passwords might be.
Create a page where the data is locally encrypted, and which only accepts
connections from valid certificates and you go a long way to being able to
communicate via WWW securely even over insecure channels.  You also free
up the method to those who don't have time, or cannot afford to run their
own WWW server.
If the location of your page is exposed, so what?  Spend the $11 a month
to open a page on another ISP.  In the "island on the net" example, you
have to reroute the entire deal.
In addition, you have now eliminated what must be the number 1 problem in
running an "iffy" page.  ISP intereference.  You have removed their
liability.  How were they supposed to know what it was you were doing?
They don't have the keys.
Now if you really wanted to be slick about it, you would use a form of
encryption to multiple users option and encrypt the page to the public
keys of individuals.  Sure, they could release the keys and spill the
beans, but they would be compromising their own keys in the process.
Mileage on this deterant will vary according to what they may have done
with the key beforehand, and it requires a multiple purpose to those keys
(as with PGP).

The deciding factor is the court's determiniation of whether the information was "material non-public information."  As the question of materiality is vague, subjective and subject to whim, even a low level employee is risking time and fines.  Often materiality has exactly zero to do with what effect it may have on stock price.
There is a simple solution to avoiding liability.  Don't trade in your own company's stock.
You make the case that it is somehow shocking to think that an employee wouldn't be able to buy stock in their employer.  Such restrictions have existed for decades.  Why are you so stunned?

Both points conceeded.
For facinating discussions of why insider trading is actually good for the market, See e.g., Henry Manne, Insider Trading and the Stock Market (1966); Michael P. Dooley, Enforcement of Insider Trading Restrictions, 66 Va.L.Rev 1 (1980); James D. Cox, Insider Trading and Contracting: A Critial Response to the "Chicago School," 1986 Duke L.J. 628 (1986); Kenneth E. Scott, Insider Trading: Rule 10b-5, Disclosure and Corporate Privacy, 9 J. Legal Stud. 801 (1980); Dennis W. Carlton & Daniel R. Fischel, The Regulation of Insider Trading, 35 Stan.L.Rev 857 (1983).
I'll sum up the general arguments for and against insider trading if there is enough interest.

If it's in relation to a tender offer, they are in deep.  (As, for example, if they were hiking up price to deter a hostile aquisition).
I direct you to Dirks v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 463 U.S. 646 Specifically footnote 14:
"Under certain circumstances, such as where corporate information is revealed legitimately to an underwriter, accountant, lawyer, or consultant working for the corporation, these outsiders may become fiduciaries of the shareholders....  When such a person breaches his fiduciary relationship, he may be treated more properly as a tipper than a tipee...."
This circumstance is classically refered to as a "footnote 14 insider."
It has been held to apply to lower level employees within the corporation who "knowingly trade based on material non-public information acquired by virtue of their position within the company."
After 1983, Mr. May may have committed a crime.
The case against Mr. May would be strengthened if a court were to accept a misappropriation theory.  (In short, that the employee used information intended for corporate purposes [development, etc.] in order to trade stock for his gain).  Misappropriation theory, where it is accepted, fills in the needed "fraud" element in rule 10b-5 which would impose liability on a trader and which is otherwise absent in the case of an employee trading as Mr. May has indicated.  While misappropriation theory is waning, it is not entirely dead.
Remember that restrictions on senior management as per trading in the company's stock are to prevent director and corporate liability.  No one cares much if a lower level employee gets zapped because it doesn't open the door for greater corporate liability like it would for senior management.  Further, you don't want to have to circulate a memo to the whole company as to when trading is restricted.  That would be asking for Be sure to distingiush between corporate policy with regard to employee trading and legality.
Or if they were artifically hiking up the price to defend against or interefere with a tender offer.

@_subject: Electronic Signature Act Of 1996 
Section 2-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provides:
(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing sufficent to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party aginst whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent or (3) A contract which does not satisify the requirements of subsection (1) but which is valid in other respects is enforceable:
(a) If the goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer and are not suitable for sale to others in the ordinary course of the seller's business and the seller, before notice of repudiation is received and under circumstances which reasonably indicate that the goods are for the buyer, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement; or
(b) If the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in his pleading, testomony or otherwise in court that a contract for sale was made, but the contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond a qualtity of goods admitted; or
(c) With respect to goods for which payment has been made and accepted or which have been received and accepted (See section 2-606).
Note:  This only applies to the sale of GOODS.  Not all states follow the UCC exactly.  Note also that the term "good" is a term of art which has a complex and non-intuative meaning.
Is it a sale of goods?  (If yes, has the forum adopted the UCC?  If no, then is there a state Statute of Frauds to look to?)
If it's not a sale of goods, well, then you have piles of contracts reading to do.
In short:  While it is safest to provide for contracts larger then $500 in writing, there are many ways that contracts can be formed for millions of dollars without a drop of ink or scrap of paper.  (Promisory Estoppel comes to mind).

I'm not sure where you got this quote.  Probably a commentator who knows jack about securities regulation.  They reversed because the SECs conclusion was expansive even with respect to Chiarella, which it implied it was following:  "Where 'tippees' - regardless of their motiviation or occupation- come into possession of material 'information that they know is confidential and know or should know came from a corporate insider,' they must either publically disclose that information or refrain from trading"  21 SEC Docket 1401, 1407 (1981).
I'm not sure I agree with your read of the facts here at all.
You failed to mention that Dirks called the Wall Street Journal with his
findings in an effort to expose the massive frauds at three times and was ignored each time.  (William Blundell was the Journal reporter).
Dirks began to tell everyone under the sun about his own first hand investigations (he visited Equity Funding in LA and talked to officers and employees) only after he was repeatedly ignored by the Journal and other publications (which refused to believe that Equity was twisted as a pretzel).  Neither Dirks nor his firm ever held interests in Equity Funding.
As word spread of the fraud, Equity funding lost half its value in two weeks.  California impounded Equity's records and revealed the fraud officially.  Finally, the SEC (who Dirks had also yelled at and been ignored by) filed a complaint (3 weeks later) and the Journal Published a story (front page April 2, 1973).
It was then, and amid criticism of the SEC, that a complaint was filed against Dirks and the SEC found Dirks had aided and abetted violations of section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, rule 10b and 10b-5 among others.  After a massive stink, the SEC backed off and stated that Dirks "played an important role in bringing [Equity Funding's] massive fraud to light," 21 SEC Docket at 1412.  The SEC elected to drop charges, and only censured Dirks.
Dirks wasn't buying this bill of goods (it seemed to have the tendency to repeatedly destroy his career) and instead and appealed to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to clear his good name.  (No fines or restrictions were imposed on Dirks, they merely held him out to be a crook in public).  The District Court entered against Dirks and he appealed to the Supreme Court which reversed.
Easy to demonize the defendant when you don't have all the facts.
Apology accepted.
An odd analysis considering both Chiarella and Dirks simply refine the defintion of insider instead of allowing the SEC to designate it.

Hearings on the hill over the child pornographer horseman:
"Morphing" seems to be the latest buzzword for putting childrens faces on the bodies of adult models in sexually explicit poses and seems to have attracted enough attention to warrant congressional attention.
Interesting that the media is playing this up as a "net" deal.  (As if somehow it were impossible to do without the all powerful and evil internet.
I'd like to see exactly how they word the proposed prohibitons.  What constitutes "child" when the face painted on is pure artistry?  Will we see a simple and strict prohibition over modifiying sexually explicit pictures to make them appear to be of younger models (whatever their apparent age may be)?  Will we see a subjective test as to what is "child looking" enough?
Silliness.  All silliness.
Prediction:  Some manner of law will be on the books (Or perhaps passed, but unsigned) before the election attempting to prohibit some form of this activity.  Certainly Clinton is not going to veto such a bill before the election, which is doubtlessly when the right is going to try to push it through.  (Can they streamline it enough to get a vote in time?)

You're lucky I even bothered to take the two minutes it required to do
Any approach to "cryotrography" [sic] which includes absolute statements
about unbreakability (like your quote above) betrays such ignorance about
the nature of the science as to render it a literal glowing neon brand on
your forehead reading :DO NOT PURCHASE CRYPTO FROM THIS MAN: and
accompanied by a loud speaker repeating same at 100dB.
Using cow feces to encrypt messages is also a brand new approach which no
one else has thought about doing.  That hardly means it is worth more than
the feces itself.
It means I consider your product dirt.  Cryptography is about economics.
I'm not going to spend time teaching you the tenants of the science
itself though it is clear you need such a lecture.  Try reading "Applied
Cryptography" for starters.
Calling a given cypher "uncrackable" is simple fiction or ignorance.
I might add that I am an attorney licensed to practice in the District of
Columbia, among other jurisdictions.  Having looked at your web page and
the comparisons you make to PGP I can tell you without much qualification
at all that it is at worst defamation and fraud.  I would not at all be
surprised to find that each sale of product you make constitutes a count
of wire fraud (18 U.S.C.A. sections 1341, 1343) and a count of mail fraud
if the product is shipped via the mails.  I also believe that ViaCrypt and
whoever else may have claim to the rights to market PGP commercially has a
clear action of defamation, tortious interference with contract and
depending on the state, unlawful sales interference.  The fraud element
would activate punative damages provisions.
Should any of these parties come to me asking for advice I would direct
them immediately to the nearest courthouse.
Tell me, is your "corporation" licensed to do business in any state?  Is
it licensed as a corporation?  Limited Liabiltiy? Many states impose
sanctions, including administrative disolution and fines, for the use of
misleading corporate forms or names while conducting interstate commerce
(which you are clearly doing).
Mr. Estridge, were I your attorney, and I thank my lucky stars that I am
not, I would suggest that you post a retraction immediately, and forward a
very polite letter of apology to ViaCrypt and perhaps Mr. Zimmerman.
Maybe they are too busy to sue you, report you to the better business
bureau, the FTC, or the state attorney general and the postmaster.

My issue was with your application of the cite and decisions to the pending bill.  (Perhaps if you are not qualified to make your own comments about court cases, and limited to citing the critiques of others, you should refrain from making inferences as to their likely or unlikely application to other legal issues).
My issue was, again, with regard to your choice of cites, the way you chose to apply them to represent a general (and flawed) attitude toward statuatory construction, and the manner in which you try to mold all of the above in a way suggesting it has the least bit to do with the bill in But, for the sake of equality, let's examine some of your legal assertions.  Or, more accurately, legal conclusions.  (BTW, where is your J.D. from?)
1> In fact, I would argue that a remailer operator will actually be considered MORE responsible, legally, than Mrs. Bennis:
2> I argue that a person who runs an anonymous encrypted remailer could be
clearly claimed to be  "entrusting" that "property" to someone else, under
the meaning of the above paragraph.
The "above paragaph," incidently, doesn't even rise to the level of court dicta, but is a abstract of dicta by a court commentator.  Using such authority to back a legal conclusion (especially when applied to an entirely seperate legal area) is twisted at best, and dangerous at worst.
3> At least, that is the position the prosecutors could surely take, especially given this Supreme Court decision.
Uh huh.  They might also take the position that the defendent is ugly, and should be convicted.  That doesn't make it a legally viable argument.
I'm not going to delve into semantics or be distracted by a war of the dictionaries.  You proport to be knowledgeable in these areas, and yet say nothing of value.  Your appeal (what of it there is) is based entirely on skewing meanings, using critiques of dicta, and generally applying inflamatory language taken out of context in a manner which suits you.  I don't think I'm off base calling it "twisted."
Perhaps you should have.  It would have set of the alarm bells of others who might have been looking at your work with anything like a critical eye and saved them the time of reading the trash.
Again, its application to the bill is what I question.  All of which throws your understanding of law, dicta, holdings, jurisprudence, and rhetoric into question.  What you should have cited was some statuatory construction and legislative history cases, not forfeiture law.  But how could you be expected to know this?
I delete fluff from my postings as a matter of courtsey to the readers.  This is a habit you do not seem to share with me.
  This seems to be a pattern: I guess I'm not the only one who thinks your prose has the bouquet of rotting herring.
I do not know Mr. Peterson, nor am I familiar with his works.  I deleted a bunch of useless gibberish, commenting in the process on its general unsuitability in the context of the post.
Distribution of reputation capital (or in this case, negative reputation capital).  I believe I also wanted to make a point (in 1,200 bytes) about the utility (or lack thereof) of your article (10,500 bytes) on this list.
Perhaps in the process I might save a newcomer from the unfortuante and embarassing fate of actually lending some authority to anything you have to say.

This will be my last comment on this thread.
Why not tell me why you didn't cite rules of statuatory construction, or the merit of looking at legislative history?  I'm hardly going to spend 4 hours of legal research to rebuke what is a patently flawed "legal" opinion.  Long time members of the list will know already that I am quite generous with my legal research when a legitimate legal problem arises.  My patience does not extend to upstarts who's knowledge of law is limited to complaining about how legal scholars and Supreme Court Justices have their head up their asses.
You dismiss 7 learned people quite quickly.  I know it's tempting to be superior to them, but as far as I can tell, you haven't even taken a judicial process class in undergrad.
This illustrates my problem with you, and your writings to the list.  This isn't the opinion of a noted legal scholar.  It's not the opinion of a renound attorney, or court observer.  It's not even the opinion of a law student.  The bottom line is that you just don't know what you're talking about.  You are wasting the list's time, my time, and, incidently, your time.
Excepting 5 surpreme court justices, the prosecution, and hundreds of years of American Jurisprudence.  Sure, you're a more legitimate judge of decisions.  Really it's just that you don't like the decision, and have latched on to anything to justify your dislike with the illusion of intelligence and knowledge, including a newspaper article in a local paper.
  And George What the hell does this have to do with your long stretch in applying it to the Leahy bill?
Wrong.  The assumption is that the rules of statuatory construction and a long history of weighing legislative history will be used in intrepreting the statute.
I could go on for paragraphs about how this basic error on your part demonstrates your misunderstanding of the divisons of labor between the Legislative and Judiciary, and that your really calling for an active Judiciary that disregards law and imposes its own view in the face of obvious legislative intent, and go on longer about the importance of using cannons of construction to insure consistancy, but none of that would change the basic fact that you just don't know what you are talking about, and that arguing with you is like talking to a soap box preacher.  You don't really care for logic.
  If Your "logic" has become a campaign speech.
No, I just feel it's probably beyond someone who couldn't name 2 cannons of statuatory intrepretation to rant on for paragraphs about the impact of a supreme court decision on a pending statute.
I'm not the one calling the Supreme Court a pile of idiots.
I'm not defending the decision at all.  Simply pointing out that it's connection to the Leahy bill is non-existant, and that you are a non-entity
when it comes to legal analysis.
I'm not interested in the opinion, or Will's explanation of what it meant.  I am interested in bringing some sanity to the list by filtering out the fluff and bullshit that results when people who know nothing about legislation or lawmaking proport to be experts.
I'm sure you, however, would be quite willing to allow a pre-med student preform your bypass operation.
Considering you have never read the opinion, or the briefs of the respective parties, and are relying on only the (perhaps legal, perhaps not) opinion of a newspaper writer, I think you're on fairly thin ice even without my help.
 as well You assume I support the Leahy Bill.  Quote me.  Where do you find my support?  Because I think you should be taken with the grain of salt your legal ignorance obviously deserves?  I could care less which side you are on, but I'm hardly going to let your ignorance be taken for anything but what it is.
1>  I have often lent my legal expertise to the list.
2>  I don't care what you or George Will think the seizure decision means, only that it has nothing to do with the Leahy bill.
3>  Challenging you is like falling off a log.
Why not demonstrate you're right first Mr. Bell?  Tell us all how the latest decision will impact Leahy bill in terms a bit more specific than "The supreme court is stupid, so you're going to get screwed."  Cite provisions.  Show us why the dicta you use is important rather than fluff.  What was the holding in the seizure case?  Do you even know?
It's easy for me to say "The latest Supreme Court Decision is going to make currency ILLEGAL!  LOOK OUT!  HIDE YOUR DOUGH!"  However, this does not mean I can expect every legal expert on the list to spend hours going over the opinion, and refuting endlessly the raving antics of my lunacy.  The burden is on the presentor to make the connection.  You're logic seems to look mostly like this.
There was a court decision.
Mr. Will is a popular newspaper writer.
therefore Mr. Will is qualified to intrepret the decision.
Mr. Will says some disparaging things about the decision.
threfore The Decision is BAD.
The decision has to do with seizure of jointly owned property.
Remailer messages are jointly owned property.
therefore the decision must apply to remailers.
Since the property in the decision was seized,
and since the Leahy bill has something to say about encryption,
and since the seizure decision means that the supreme court has their head up their ass,
therefore remailer messages and remailers WILL BE SEIZED.
If there is a more logical chain here, I'd love to hear it.

Careful here.  Note exactly what the bill says:
wire and electronic communications necessary to provide for
public safety and national security should also be preserved;
SHOULD ALSO be preserved.
Typically this means that it's not going to be funded by this bill, and that this is just a bit of extra hint as to legislative intent.
I will grant you that it's not a nice bit, but it could easily have said "WILL be preserved."
Note this clause also does not assign the authority to any agency, or suggest how it might be accomplished.  It's a good indicator of where things are going, but in itself, it implements nothing.
(Disclaimer: I haven't read the entire bill yet).

This is getting out of hand.
There's a distinct difference between tolerating prostitution and actively supporting it.
Your example lacks facts (as usual) which I'm sure you will fill in at your next opportunity with a load of dung you pull out of the air.
In the event a hotel knowingly supported prostitution, charged by the hour only to prostitutes, paid off police to avoid their notice, was owned by those connected with the illegal enterprise of prostitution and otherwise supported an ongoing criminal enterprise actively and directly, of course it will be seized.  This, as far as I can tell, has almost nothing to do with Mr. May's example which proffered a passive role, a tacid understanding and looking the other way by the hotel management.  A judge who upheld such a seziure would be asked, probably less politely than my last example, to leave the bench.  That a hotel is being seized, absent any showing of reason or circumstance, has so little to do with this point as to be amusing.  I cannot say, however, that I am If there is enough interest, outside of you Mr. Bell, I will post a summary of asset forfeiture requirements under RICO and common law to the Mr. Bell, your chronic out of context examples, stuffing of words into other peoples mouths (or posts), ignorance, and flatulant expositions have easily qualified you, in my book, as the most annoying and useless poster on the list.

@_subject: [Noise] Jim Bell: Legal Reformer 
This I never denied.  I agree with Mr. Stewart, it's unfortunate that the law is so complex sometimes.  Unfortunate also is the fact that there is no solution.  "Thou shall not kill,"  while simple in concept, and generally understood, lacks specificty.  Kill what?  Do animals count? Define kill?  Does self defense apply?  What about suicide?  Is the self included in the realm of those not to be killed?  (Incidently, the common understanding is incorrect in any event, the closer translation is "Thou shall not commit Murder.")
As legal jurisprudence moved from legal formalism (apply the letter of the law, and only the letter of the law, and damn the result, even if unjust or beyond the intention of the legislature) moved into legal realism, and progressive legal thought, it became more and more difficult to predict what the results of litigation might be.  This is because judges were no longer, at least to the extent they were in the early 19th and late 18th centuries, simple clerks who read the law and enforced it, but rather individuals who intrepreted the intent of the law makers, and applied the law with a mind to avoiding injustice.
The "Seal" is a classic example.  At one point, if your name was on a contract, that was it, you were bound by it.  Seems ideal in some ways, but what if you were intoxicated, or couldn't read?  What if you were told that the contract was a lease, and only after signing it did you discover it was a contract for your endentured servitude?
Legal formalism says:
"Is this your name here?"
"Yes, but-"
"Judgement for the plaintiff."
Well now.  How do you write a law that expresses the will of the lawmakers on a complex subject with the added twist of judicial intrepretation?  Judges are people too.  Some judges look at the congressional record to see what it was congress was trying to do exactly, some believe legislative history is a bunch of hooey.  Mr. Bell, apparently, thinks he can do a better job.  I'd like to seem him try.
I don't want to be an apologist for attorneys, I have a lot of problems with the legal profession in general.  This doesn't change the fact that not everyone on the planet can read a bill and a complicated supreme court decision and apply them together to an entirely unrelated area.  In fact, most lawyers will have problems too.  If not, then there would never be court cases.  The parties to litigation would already know the outcome, and fighting it would be pointless.  Do you really think this is ever going to happen?
Someone with almost no legal experience, on the other hand, is simply out of their league.  Mr. Bell, this means you.  I'm sorry we can't all run like Carl Lewis, I know that would be a perfect world, well in some people's view anyhow.  But this kind of finger pointing, and name calling, and cries of "elitist" it begins to look like the kind of left-speak that argues that everyone has the same potential in life.  Mr. Bell's opinion aside, (I already know what he thinks) I'd have to be an idiot to go to law school for 3 years plus post grad work and still come out knowing no more than someone who looks at lexis a lot.  Sorry, if that makes me elitist, so be it.  (I happen to be elitist for other reasons, but that's beside the point).
Can the average person read a criminal statute and tell how old a sexual partner has to be to avoid statuatory rape charges in their state?  Sure.  That's easy.  That part of the law is fairly available.  Now take the same person and ask them what the supreme court case ruling that parents can sue a man for "corruption of a child" (taking her viginity) even after the pair is legally married means in their specific case.  Not so easy anymore.
Point being, it's easier to look at criminal law and decide what it is you are not supposed to do (because such statutes are fairly specific about the conduct they are trying to restrict, and need very little complexity) than it is to apply complex regulatory statutes to asset seizure cases and entirely distinct fields.  Mr. Bell seems to think that because he knows when he will get a parking ticket, he's qualified to render his legal opinions to the list as if they were gospel, and no one is entitled to question his qualifications.
That's Mr. Black Unicorn to you.
1) You wouldn't know reasoned argument if it bit you on the ass.
2) My position (Which I am assuming you are even intrepreting correctly) is hardly odd or uncommon.  I would say it's fairly common knowledge that you will be in better shape if you e.g. hire a lawyer to do your will than if you do it alone.  I would say you'd have to be an idiot to even try to represent yourself in the most simple criminal case for assault.
And thus were patently inflexible.  That's legal formalism.  I might add that laws were not always so written.  Nero posted all the laws publically, and wrote them clearly.  At the same time, he posted them at the top of the columns in the senate, so no one could read them.  Writing law so it's accessible to the common man is not an easy thing.  One could easily make the arguement that laws were never accessible in that way, Mr. Bell's unsupported assertion aside.
See my contract example above as to why this is complete ignorance and Simplicty and fair law simply do not go together.  If the elitists have had their way for so long, perhaps you should look to the electorate who continually sends them to the capitol.  I might add that I have never seen simple legislation in the way that you mean it from the law makers that have never even been to law school either.  (There are plenty of them too).
I don't believe this is obvious at all.  First, what does my acknowledgement of the complexity of law, and the need for a profession to intrepret it have to do with my contribution of the problem?
Second, you say:
Forgive me, Mr. Bell, but isn't this exactly what you are accusing me of saying?  "Ordinary people can't understand the law," is your point, yes?  Why then aren't you part of the problem?
Or is it just when ">people like "Black Unicorn" claim that ordinary people [can't understand the law]" that there is a problem?  Your entire point hinges on your personal dislike of either me, or lawyers, as you have said exactly the same thing I have said all along.  Law is so complicated, you need a lawyer to figure it out.  Funny, that's precisely what I was trying to get at in telling you to stop posting to the list your ravings about Supreme Court cases because you had no idea what you were talking about.  Seems you've conceeded my point.  I may be elitist, but even you, in your own words, admit that my ilk is necessary.
I'm sure this has something to do with the point at hand.

@_subject: RICO and remailers (brief treatment, if long) 
Several people expressed interest in a small treatment of seizure law jurisprudence, and the Bennis case (seizure of an automobile used for soliciting prostitution was upheld even where one of the owners knew nothing about its use for a crime and which Mr. Bell has relied on fairly heavily in pointing out that the Supreme Court has its "head up its ass.")
I want to point out that I'm not being paid for this.  As a result anyone who takes this like legal advice, rather than what it is, i.e. an academic examination, does so at their own peril.
I cover RICO because it's a popular prosecution tool, because it is the predominate vehicle for seizure and forfeiture in federal cases (of which remailer and encryption issues are likely to arouse) and because it represents a codification of the approach most courts take when dealing with seizure cases.  In a very real way, RICO represents the outer extremes of seizure cases in the United States, and is probably, given the complexity of many state laws, the simplest way to "grab" something.  It also has civil provisions which make "private prosecutors" out of you and me.
Generally speaking, after its passage (1970) RICO was ignored.  (Interested readers might look to Bradley, Racketeers, Congress and the Courts: An Analysis of RICO, 65 Iowa Law Review, 837 (1980). for a detailed review of its early development).  It was "rediscovered" some years later, and grew in popularity because of the civil provisions for divestiture, dissolution, reorganization, and restrictions on future activites as well as treble damages under 18 U.S.C. 1964.
Generally speaking, in order to secure a conviction with RICO, one must prove the existance of an "enterprise" and a connected "pattern of racketeering activity."  RICO prosecutions are generally triggered by predicate acts, listed specifically in the statute.  The statute lists these in the definitions section.  (Section 1961)  I reproduce some below to give the reader a feel for what is anticipated:
As used in this chapter--
(1) "racketeering activity" means (A) any act or threat involving murder, kidnaping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, dealing in obscene matter, or dealing in a controlled substance or listed chemical (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substance Act), which is chargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year; (B) any act which is indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States Code: [bribery, sports bribery, counterfeiting, theft from interstate shipment, embezzlement from pension or welfare funds, extortionate credit transactions, mail fraud, transmission of gambling information, wire fraud, financial institution fraud, obscene matters, obstruction of justice, tampering with witnesses, informants or victims, money laundering, monetary transactions with respect to property derived from unlawful activity, sexual exploitation of children, white slavery, (some deleted)]  (18 U.S.C. 1961)
The activities specifically prohibited by RICO are also statuatorily defined.  Specifically:
(a) It shall be unlawful for any person who has received any income derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of racketeering activity... in which such person has participated as a principal within the meaning of section 2, title 18, United States Code, to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part of such income, or the proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any interest in, or the estlablishment or operation of, any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce....
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.
(c) It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of an unlawful debt.  (Section 1962)
(d) [or to conspire to do any of the above]
The seizure provisions are contained in 18 U.S.C., Section 1963:
(a) Whoever violates any provision of section 1962 of this chapter shall be [fined and imprisoned or both] and shall forfeit to the United States, irrespective of any provision of State Law--
(1) any interest the person has acquired or maintained in violation of section 1962;
(2) any --
(A) interest in;
(B) security of;
(C) claim against; or
(D) property or contractual right of any kind affording a source of influence over;
[the enterprise violating section 1962]; and
(3) any property constituting, or derived from, any proceeds which the person obtained, directly or indirectly, from racketeering activity or unlawful debt collection in violation of section 1962.
(b) Property subject to criminal forfeiture under this sections (1) real property, including things growing to, affixed to, and found in land; and
(2) tangible and intangible personal property, including rights, privileges, interests, claims and securities.
The lead case generally used to outline the overall principals of RICO is United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576 (1981).
Most of the defining litigation surrounding RICO involved refining the definitions of "enterprise" and "pattern" of racketeering.  Turkette indicates in part that:
Section 1962(c) makes it unlawful "for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt."  The term "enterprise" is defined as including "any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity."  (Turkette)
Of primary importance, and the key issue in Turkette, is the fact that "There is no restriction upon the associations embraced by the definition: an enterprise includes any union or group of individuals associated in fact." Id.
Both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises qualify.  United States v. Hartley, 678 F.2d 961 (11th Cir. 1982) applied RICO to an otherwise legitimate corporate defendant.  On the subject of passive involvement of a defendant in criminal activity the court in Haroco Inc. v. American Nat'l Bank & Trust Co. 747 F.2d 284 (7th Cir. 1984) ...the defendants are surely correct in saying that the corporation enterprise should not be liable when the corporation is itself the victim or target or merely the passive instrument for the wrongdoing of others... The liable person may be a corporation using the proceeds of a pattern of racketeering activity in its operations.  This approach... makes the corporation enterprise liable under RICO when the corporation is actually the direct or indirect beneficiary of the pattern of racketeering activity, but not when it is merely the victim, prize, or passive instrument of racketeering.  This result is in accord with the primary purpose of RICO, which, after all, is to reach those who ultimately profit from racketeering, not those who are victimized by it. (This preference for enterprise liability has been followed by other courts. See e.g., Schreiber Distributing Co. v. Serv-Well Furniture Co., 806 F.2d 1393 (9th Cir. 1986); Commonwealth of Pa. v. Derry Construction Co., 617 F.Supp 940 (W.D.PA 1985).  See generally, First, Business Crime, 1990)
And Ravens v. Ernst and Young, 113 S.Ct. 1163, refines the definition of "conduct or participate" thusly:
Once we understand the word "conduct" to require some degree of direction, and the word "participate" to require some part in that direction, the meaning of section 1962(c) comes into focus.  In order to "participate, directly or indirectly in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs," one must have some part in directing those affairs.  Of course, the word "participate" makes clear that RICO liability is not limited to those with primary responsibility for the enterprise's affairs, just as the phrase "directly or indirectly" makes clear that RICO liability is not limited to those with a formal position in the enterprise, [note 4] but some part in directing the enterprise's affairs is required.  The "operation or management" test expresses this requirement in a formulation that is easy to apply... In sum, we hold that "to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs," one must participate in the operation or management of the enterprise itself.
Let us assume for a moment then that the worst conspiracy one can imagine, involving all of the horsemen of the infopocalypse, uses a remailer to conduct its activities.  Absent a showing that the conspiracy is involved, participating, or directing the operation of the remailer, or that the conspiracy used proceeds to support the remailer, it is pretty clear that the remailer, and the operator are a "passive instrument" of the conspiracy.
One might also look to the Justice Department Guidelines for the use of RICO as a prosecutoral tool:
"...it is not the policy of the criminal Division to approve "imaginative" prosecutions under RICO which are far afield from the Congressional purpose of the RICO statute.... Further, it should be noted that only in exceptional circumstances will approval be granted when RICO is sought merely to serve some evidentiary purpose, rather than to attack the activity which Congress most directly addressed- the infiltration of organized crime into the nation's economy."  (9-
110.200, RICO guidelines preface).
One might also look at the second circuit in Huber:
"We further note that where the forfeiture [under RICO] threatens disproportionately to reach untainted property of the defendant... section 1963 permits the [court] a certain amount of discretion in avoiding draconian (and perhaps unconstitutional) applications of the forfeiture provision."
In sum, provided no statute exists expressly felonizing the operation of e-mail forwarding or encryption, I wouldn't much worry about RICO.  It is possible, I suppose, to construct a creative (very creative) argument that mere operation of a remailer is wire fraud, and thus triggers RICO and allows seizure, but I find this fairly unlikely. I might add that future legislation prohibiting "furtherance of a felony via encryption" or some such is almost certain to have a scienter requirement making innocent forwarders of such information  who did not know they were furthering a felony immune from the statute, and thus RICO.
The Michigan Case, and why it has absolutely nothing to do with Mr. Bell has made a great to-do about the Bennis case (seizure of automobile absent showing that co-owner knew of criminal use of same).  His connection of the case to remailers is surrounded by a good deal of imagination, myth, and outright fabrication.  I thought I would take a closer look and see what was to be found.  That done, let me then dispel some of the myths.
Myth   This holding means that any property can be seized for any crime and the owner placed at the mercy of the state at a whim.
Totally false.  The Michigan law is specifically written to allow property seizure in the specific instance of prostitution or gambling.  Many states have forfeiture laws, but they are an extreme resort, and typically bear only on very narrow activities.  Michigan, further, is at the draconian side of the spectrum.  Michigan also has some of the toughest state drug laws in the country (Automatic life sentence without parole for mere possession without intent to distribute, of more than 650 grams of cocaine)  Consider the Michigan law used in Bennis, reproduced below.
Section 600.3801 of Michigan's Compiled Laws. states in pertinent part: "Any building, vehicle, boat, aircraft, or place used for the purpose of lewdness, assignation or prostitution or gambling, or used by, or kept for the use of prostitutes or other disorderly persons... is declared a nuisance... and all... nuisances shall be enjoined and abated as provided in this act and as provided in the court rules.  Any person or his or her servant, agent, or employee who owns, leases, conducts, or maintains any building, vehicle, or place used for any of the purposes or acts set forth in this section is guilty of a nuisance."
Section 600.3825 states in pertinent part:
   "(1) Order of abatement. If the existence of the nuisance is established in an action as provided in this chapter, an order of abatement shall be entered as a part of the judgment in the case, which order shall direct the removal from the building or place of all furniture, fixtures and contents therein and shall direct the sale thereof in the manner provided for the sale of chattels under execution . . . .
"(2) Vehicles, sale. Any vehicle, boat, or aircraft found by the court to be a nuisance within the meaning of this chapter, is subject to the same order and judgment as any furniture, fixtures and contents as herein provided."  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. @ 600.3825 Myth  This means that if your property is seized, you can never make an innocent owner defense to the seizure.
Again, false.  Many statutes allow innocent owner defenses and some courts will assume the availability of such a defense in absence of express intent by the legislature to the contrary.  In this case there was such an expression.  Namely:
"Proof of knowledge of the existence of the nuisance on the part of the defendants or any of them, is not required." Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. @ 600.3815(2) (1987).
Myth  If your car is stolen, and it is used in the sales of drugs, its gone baby.
False.  Most states recognize that use of property without the owner's consent insulates the property from seizure.  Michigan is no exception.  Note the Supreme Court's Comment in the Bennis Case:
The Michigan Supreme Court specifically noted that, in its view, an owner's interest may not be abated when "a vehicle is used without the owner's consent." Id., at 742, n. 36, 527 N.W.2d at 495, n. 36.
Myth   This is a new and outlandish holding by the Supreme Court.  Nothing like this has ever been seen before.  It represents a turn to fascism.  The current Supreme Court has its head up its ass.
False.  The history of allowing seizure of property not taken without the owners consent, even if the specific use of the property was indeed without the owners knowledge, goes back more than 150 years and can be traced to Britain's own practice (maintained to this day).  Take the Supreme Court's comment again in the Bennis Case:
Our earliest opinion to this effect is Justice Story's opinion for the Court in The Palmyra, 25 U.S. 1, 12 Wheat. 1, 6 L. Ed. 531 (1827). The Palmyra, which had been commissioned as a privateer by the King of Spain and had attacked a United States vessel, was captured  [*10]   by a United States war ship and brought into Charleston, South Carolina, for adjudication. Id., at 8. On the Government's appeal from the Circuit Court's acquittal of the vessel, it was contended by the owner that the vessel could not be forfeited until he was convicted for the privateering. The Court rejected this contention, explaining:
"The thing is here primarily considered as the offender, or rather the offense is attached primarily to the thing." Id., at 14.
Myth   This means that if someone drives my car to the city, and then blows up a building and flees via subway, my car is history.
False.  In order to allow seizure, the property seized must typically be an "instrumentality" of the crime.  Granted this is a bit of a obscure distinction at times, even to supreme court justices:
The limits on what property can be forfeited as a result of what wrongdoing--for example, what it means to "use" property in crime for purposes of forfeiture law--are not clear to me. See United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U.S., ___ (1993) (slip op., at 2-5) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). But it's fairly clear that this is a significant defense to seizure, and one which was never raised by the defense in Bennis:
It thus seems appropriate, where a [challenge] by an innocent owner is concerned, to apply [the instrumentality] limits rather strictly, adhering to historical standards for determining whether specific property is an "instrumentality" of crime. Cf. J. W. Goldsmith, Jr.-Grant Co., supra, at 512 (describing more extreme hypothetical applications of a forfeiture law and reserving decision on the permissibility of such applications).The facts here, however, do not seem to me to be obviously distinguishable from those involved in Van Oster; and in any event, Mrs. Bennis has not asserted that the car was not an instrumentality of her husband's crime. (Bennis)
After getting the government's brief by fax this afternoon, it became fairly clear why the non-instrumentality defense was not made:
After John Bennis was seen stopping and allowing Ms. Polarchio to enter his car, the Police followed him to a residential area, midway in the block, where his car stopped and the lights were turned off. (TR-63-65) After the police stopped behind the Bennis' auto, two heads were seen: a female on the right, a male on the left. Seconds later, the female head went down, disappearing toward the drivers side. (TR 65-66)
When the officer observed John Bennis and Kathy Polarchio engaged in fellatio in the Bennis' car, John Bennis had his pants pulled down. (TR-67)  (Bennis: Brief for the Government)
It's pretty hard to argue that the automobile was not an instrumentality of the crime when it was used to pick up, transport and conceal, indeed make possible the very illicit sexual practices of the defendant which are at issue.  (i.e. public solicitation of prostitution and lewd conduct on a public street within the car itself, conduct probably not possible in this form without the automobile).
Myth  The court just doesn't care about property rights.
False.  The court spends a great deal of time thinking about the parties rights, and even suggests a different ruling had the car not be co-owned by the perpetrator of the crime.
First, it bears emphasis that the car in question belonged to John Bennis as much as it did to Tina Bennis. At all times he had her consent to use the car, just as she had his. (Bennis)
It also considered what Mrs. Bennis would actually gain from a ruling in her favor from a practical standpoint:
Th[e] court declined to order a division of sale proceeds, as the trial judge took pains to explain, for two practical reasons: the Bennises have "another automobile," App. 25; and the age and value of the forfeited car (an 11-year-old Pontiac purchased by John and Tina Bennis for $ 600) left "practically nothing" to divide after subtraction of costs. See ante, at 3 (majority opinion) (citing App. While it is tempting to damn the decision after listening to the sound bytes, there is much more going on here than a mere seizure.
Remailer operators shouldn't be concerned (at least with regard to these cases) overmuch until a local state statute addressing remailers specifically is passed in a jurisdiction where the innocent owner defense is not permitted, or in any jurisdiction where such statute forbids resort to the innocent owner defense.  I will, however, note that this is only about 3 hours work, and I wouldn't go betting the farm on it.

You know, the more I read, the more I understand why the United States is a declining power.  The education in this country must really be slipping.
Who cares what the chairman of the committee who forwarded the bill thought?  He is but one member who voted or declined to vote for the The view that he has any more authority than any other member who supported the bill is a silly one.  Indeed, he may have had LSD out of mind when he wrote the bill, but unless you poll every member of congress as to their understanding of the bill, this means little if anything at all.
If a bill passes that says "All discharging of firearms within the District of Columbia is illegal."  Who cares if the chairman of the judiciary says (after the fact incidently) that he didn't think of handguns when he wrote the bill.  Obviously congress has passed an ambigious statute.  They could very easily have clarified the statute and applied the correction retroactively.  This they did not do, (despite the fact that they have often done so before, and that the court often invites congress to revisit an issue and make a correction, and congress often does).
You mean, help a lot of convicted drug felons.  And even if they are deserving of help (I personally could care if people use drugs as long as they don't operate heavy machinery in public areas thereafter) where is the congress leaping to the rescue and writing an amendment to apply a corrective act retroactively?  (Which, incidently, is arguably beyond the power of the supreme court to do).  One might also note that the district court and the circut court came to the same conclusion in reading the intent of the statute.  You think those judges had their heads up their asses too?  You're talking now about 15 people who all came to the same conclusion.  Who's wrong?  These Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Georgetown and Stanford educated legal professionals, or you?
And you think that instead we should have two legislative branches second guessing one another?  What the hell is the law supposed to be if congress can't write it properly?  And if the manner of its application offends congress so much why has it not been corrected retroactively?  Kennedy in this respect is acting as one of the more rational justices.  It is the activist justices that go crazy and stretch the law beyond the bounds of its intent.
Sure, it's easy enough to appeal to the libertarian in everyone by citing a supposedly silly result in a drug case, but you are fighting with smoke and mirrors here.  The real issue is one of seperation of powers.
It never ceases to amaze me how smart "commentators" like this think they are when they makes grand denouncements of the system.  It never ceases to amaze me that almost every single one of these "commentators" knows so little about the way the system really works that it's a wonder they passed the constitution test in 8th grade.  (Was it required when you were in school?  Probably not).
The more they talk, the more they prove my point.
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.
A little legal knowledge is lethal.

Uh, I'm not sure what this sentence means.
When it can be directly applied to your opinion that the Bennis case has anything to do with remailers, sure.
[Whining about how a supreme court decision upholding the use of acid measurements including the weight of blotter paper as a guide to sentencing was really unfair deleted.]
Actually, the decision was in line with a long history of precident.  That fact that you personally don't like the result has little to do with the legitimacy of the decision, or its fairness under law and the Precisely.  This is called the seperation of powers.  It is the responsibility of the judicary to apply and intrepret the law, not make it.
Actually, if a decision is so damaging, congress is always free to change it.  The major whine you and your anonymous friend have [i.e. that the Supreme court refused to apply the change in sentencing measurement of weight for LSD convictions] is entirely out of place.  If you took the time to look at the retroactivity issue, you would know that it was not applied retroactively because congress did not indicate that it should have been, (which congress was quite free to do, and has done before).  Retroactivity in relation to a change in law by the legislature is NOT within the ambit of the court.  Congress simply refused to apply the sentencing changes retroactively.  If the court had done so, it would be making law.  This is not the function of the court.
Further, what the hell does any of this have to do with your former moronic claim that the Bennis case impacted remailers?  The claim that this is a statuatory construction case is rather far fetched.  It's a basic seperation of powers case, and it was decided correctly.
Unfortunately, subjecting the supreme court to the short term whims of political fad would be devestating.  Making supreme court justices into elected officials is about the stupidist thing I've ever heard.  I won't even go into the kind of decisions you might get if this horridly reckless idea were implemented.
I think you need to crawl back under the rock from whence you came.
Really you and your anonymous friend have said nothing.  You don't like a pair of supreme court decisions, the basic premises and reasonings of which you couldn't recite if someone held a gun to your head and insisted.
I suggest you try and break the ego-centric pre-school mentality you have.  An eternity with satan himself and all of his devilish instruments of torture would be a walk in the park compared to five minutes in a dictatorship under you and anonymous.

However, there is a case to be made that a basic difference between a magazine, in this example, and source code exists.
The magazine itself is the instrumentality.  When it's mailed to you, you can give it to whomever you like.  The pages and paper are your property, along with the ink.
In the case of the code, it is itself the instrumentality.  Handing it out for free (unsolicited and without a binding NDA) might render the item itself (the code) public domain.  (Or more accurately, the act of so distributing it renders it defacto in the public domain).  Especially in the context in which this code was released.
I'm not sure it's a compelling argument in and of itself, but in the context of the manner of distribution, and the major goof on the part of IDG in releasing the material generally, I would suspect no one has much to worry about.  Asking for a public review of material, and then enforcing "copyrights" when that review releases some of, perhaps even all of the material is rather silly.  I'd be surprised if a court paid much attention.

@_subject: Leahy Bill: Conspiracy, or Predictable Legislation? 
Leahy had his own opinions about the issues to begin with.  Leahy has taken an interest in all these matters since and before the Clipper hearings.
Your fault here is assuming that "we" are the only ones who know anything about the crypto issue.  "We" represent only a portion of those in the field who know what they are talking about.
John Podesta is a good example.  Podesta could care less what anyone on this list has to say, but he was fairly key in designing DigiTel clauses, and was deeply involved in development of Clipper as well.  Podesta knows the issues without being on this list at all.  Now how exactly it was that you came to the conclusion that someone told Leahy "what we want" (as if there was some meaning to "we" and, accordingly, as if "what we want" could even be defined) is a bit of a mystery to me.  Legislators are not the morons you seem to take them for.  This is conspiracy buff flaw   (There is a huge and silent set of people who think exactly as I do.  Because they are not heard, they must be oppressed or made to be silent).
Being a member of the cypherpunk list is not a requirement to know the issues.  Part of your problem is basic arrogance.  Many conspiracy buffs share this flaw.  The legislator's staff (who are paid quite handsomly to be in the know, and often hired based on their expertise in the first place) don't really need much help in pinning down the issues.  This is why I say that pointing to the legislators and yelling "they must have had help!  Someone in here is in cahoots with them!" is the height of arrogance.  (Conspiracy buff flaw Further, who cares who contributed to the bill?  Hundreds of people with basic roles in creating legislation are forgotten every day.  So?
I'm lazy.  But if someone sends me the bill in full via e-mail, I'll do an analysis for the list.
I disagree.  If Denning wasn't in on the development of the bill to begin with, then how is it you think she is going to be crowned with some glowing mystical authority when she does or does not complain?  Even assuming she was given such authority, negative barometer to who?  Denning is well respected in the field by "those who matter," (a subset in which your "WE" seems to be poorly represented) and as such I can't imagine how you think that her approval would in any way be the "kiss of death."  This is a combination of conspiracy buff flaws  (arrogance: because "we" dislike Denning, everyone else must, or if Denning spurred "us" into action, the bill surely would be dead), and conspiracy buff flaw   ("Our" "enemy" is already so demonized, they could never agree with us).
Ok.  Who's "we?"  (Flaw  all over again)  And who says that you can't re-write the bill?  Be my guest.  You seem to be able to type line after line of dribble.  One would think you'd be a good legislator.  Certainly for all the credit you give lawmakers, your mastery of the legislative process, your expertise in predicting and observing the Supreme Court, one would wager you're just the person.
I'm sure you'll have no trouble passing a basically liberal bill that the FBI will scream bloody murder about through a "law and order" republican congress in the middle of an election year and in the wake of a democratic president's public relations coup in dealing with international terrorism.  Sure the republicans will look soft for supporting the bill, but at a time like this, security is unimportant to them, right?
And this part I love: "and condition our support on that edited bill."  Flaws number 1 and 2 all over again.  You think Leahy needs our support?
Go ahead, Mr. Bell.  Rewrite the bill, send it to Leahy.  Let me know what he says.  FDR couldn't pass a bill like that today.
Really I've never understood Leahy's position to be a strongly free-speech one in the first place.  While at the Clipper and DigiTel hearings, it was fairly clear to me that both Leahy and Specter were uninterested in the free speech issues, (aside a few needed sound bytes) and rather the stagnation of the technology sector of the U.S. economy through export regulation.  (The strength and growth in this sector and the phrase "leader in the world" was mentioned several times).  Specter cared less so even about this at the time.  Even in a public hearing I recall his concern was lackluster.  Recall also that Specter chairs the Select Committee on Intelligence.  Hardly a free speecher in any shape, even though many on this list hailed him as an provisional ally after the Clipper hearings.
here.  Leahy's bill, what of it I see, addresses his main concern, exports and U.S. technology growth.  Specter was never much on our side to begin with.
In many ways a lot of the attitudes from those yelling "traitors" here are the height of hypocracy.
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend." (of Specter and Leahy)
"Once an enemy, always an enemy." (of Denning)
The proper course to take would have started with a more accurate assessment of the allies of strong and unescrowed encryption.  Counting on Leahy and Specter was a major mistake.  Industry has always been the way to go (A little back patting here, I said as much at the D.C. cypherpunks meeting back when in the midst of Clipper, no one listened to me then either).  This is the reason I was so enraged with netscape.  People listen to large, publically traded companies, most of whom are content to take their licks and move on right now.  Netscape was about the only one who could have put a foot in the door and given people a taste of what they were missing.
I find your assessment optimistic in the extreme.
I believe the concentration should be more in the direction of developing crypto tools that have long "half lives," stealth properties, and generally prepare for the regulation or ban of strong crypto without escrow.
I've called for this before, I call for it again.
Where are more effective (and multiplatform) Stealth PGP versions?  4096 bit RSA type keys?  256 bit conventional cyphers?
This political climate is more fear and fourhorsemen driven than anything else.  In the face of a democratic shift to law and order, and a matching republican shift even further in the same direction, the First Amendment, which is generally applied to public speech in any event, is unlikely to provide much protection here.

I'm not sure anyone will bother brute forcing or anything else given your approach.  Many c'punks take offense at being used like unpaid crypto consultants.  A good portion of people on this list bill hefty fees for their time (or should).
This is not freecryptanalysis at toad.com.
I think, should you have the right attitude, many people here will be happy to review your source code, given some pre-conditions.  Mr. May summed these up quite well only days ago in the IDG (or whatever) snakeoil thread.  I would suggest you take a gander at his post on the subject.  Briefly, (and I hope I'm not butchering his points to bitterly), he indicated that unless you had hit on most of the basic source material to begin with (applied cryptography for example), and really knew a bit about the subject, most people wouldn't much care to pay attention to you.
I think, however, that if you know your stuff, and you release the source code to the list, many people here will be open minded enough to take a good look, give you some pointers, perhaps even improve your work.
I know, however, that almost no one is going to go for that "crack this for me please" crap unless there is a bonded cash award attached.
To much time, nothing in it for us.
Take a look at Mr. May's cyphermonicon, (anyone have the URL/FTP handy for our new friend?)

I suggest instead that everyone be nice and quiet.  If they get busy enough, this issue might not rear its ugly head for a few terms.

@_subject: So, what crypto legislation (if any) is necessary? (Was List O' , shame) 
This kind of legislation would be painfully unenforceable.  How do you know if crypto was used in the commission of a crime unless you can offer the plaintext to show that the content was criminal or in furtherance of a criminal act or conspiracy, >and< that the content was encrypted?
This kind of statute nearly requires escrowed encryption or the old standby, stupid crooks.  I'd be happy to see this pass alone because I think it would placate some of the screaming crypto-frady-cats on the hill much the way the cosmetic assualt "looking" weapons ban did, but I think this unlikely.
It's like criminalizing the destruction of bodies in furtherance of murder.  What's the point?  Just use obstruction of justice.
After doing some work in a somewhat related area (I'm about to release the workproduct to the list), I am more and more dubious as to the protections the 4th and 5th amendments will provide in these instances.
I think many people on the list here had the right idea generally.  No legislation is good legislation for crypto.  Really the ITAR applications are beseiged right now, and will probably fizzle out of their own accord, not to mention the fact that they are de facto moot.
In practice it is trivial to subvert ITAR for the purposes of worldwide crypto availability.
Someone just needs to get a foreign entity producing strong hardware encryption in Estonia (hardware IDEA would be nice) to capitalize on the markets in the U.S. and non-escrow jurisdictions in Europe and Asia.
If we have no-legislation and a foreign producer of strong crypto soft and hardware for the next 3 years, I think we are way ahead of the game.
Unfortunately, I think some version of crypto legislation is going to see passage in the next pair of years.  Leahy certainly isn't going to give up, and he may have a bit more momentum after an election year runs its Whoever wins the election, I think you can expect to see even more aggressive bills from congress on the subject.
All it would take is one anti-trust case with encryption as a concealing method and people would be busting down doors at night looking for PGP.

Let's put this to bed.  The bill isn't going to pass.  Let's PRETEND it gets sent to the Select Committee on Intelligence, which would be it's most favorable Committee speed wise (I seem to remember it got sent to commerce instead?), they have about 30 days to hash it through and spit it out.  That leaves 10 or so days to work out the bugs and pass the bill and then some 5 days to rectify with the house version?  Puhleeeease. Except that no one is going to fix it, and no one is going to support it if fixed in the way that Mr. Bell proposes.  In other words, everything is wrong with 'fixing it.'
Leahy is about as far left on technology as they come. (One of 4-5 (I forget) who actually opposed Exon).  I spoke with legislative counsel today and brought up the issue.  The bill is dead.  Even Dole, who's on as a sponsor, has no idea what's in the text.  He signed on to look connected and on the cutting edge for the upcoming election.  The slightest pressure from Specter and the Powerful Intelligence Committee (which you can count on), will send Dole running for cover quite quickly.  (Dole then will be able to claim techno-savvy as well as law and order headcracking).
Your tax dollars at work.  More useless legislative rambling to make Mr. Bell happy.  If the bill isn't adopted this session, nothing but a full rewrite is likely to revive it.  That rewrite is going to be next session and go to the right, not the left.  Mr. Bell persists in demanding a politically unviable re-write.  To Mr. Bell I say: "Write your Senator.

Phew.  I thought for a moment you meant legal problems.
Yes, I concede, there are significant logistical hurdles confronting the multi-jurisdictional crypto project.  One assumes, however, that the initial capital investment will be somewhat offset by the first in market advantage of the position.
Further, a entirely foreign production, say for chip manufacture, would probably make things easier.  I had specifically contemplated hardware applications.  Indeed, there are problems with both, but they don't stem from ITAR.
Are you talking specific licensing provisions, or implementation.  I don't follow.  (Though I'm fairly sure I'm missing something obvious).

You're talking about the 6th amendment confrontation clause.  Really, that's unrelated to requests for production of documents via the subpoena process, which is more related to the due process clause.
Like I said in a related message, I have seen fines of $75,000 a day leveled against "bad faith" third parties for not complying with grand jury subpoenas for documents.
Unfortunately, this is incorrect.  Subpoena power is immensely potent in the United States, and is arguably the most violent extraterratorial exercise of American sovreignty there is.
It's no different than a safety deposit box.  The bank is hardly going to endure prosecution and significant for withholding lawful access to a defendant's safety deposit box.
And Ohio never joined the union and thus is a tax haven, yadda, yadda, yadda.
They are as "subpoena-able" as the escrow agent is unwilling to bear the burden of multi-million dollar fines and the defendant unwilling to bear the burden of incarceration.

@_subject: What backs up digital money? 
[Excellent points about gold's practical use, good timing, and industrial value countered by the current lack of industrial value.]
I was with you until this.  In fact diamonds are anything but rare.  Their value is the result of the most exceptional marketing by DeBeers, and the very tight restrictions on supply.  I might note that the restrictions on supply are even somewhat tangential.  DeBeers has created one of the most historic, long standing and impressive market distortions anyone has ever seen.
Of course this only goes to further the argument (which I think you are adopting) that it is fairly simple to estlablish a commodity of "value" regardless of intrinsic worth)
Even gem quality stones are relatively abundant believe it or not.
Again, even absent the intrinsic value of the substance it seems that marketing and perception will dictate "effective value."
This is precisely the point, and why, while I agree with your comments about gold today, I think the most important issue is the long term solvency of a commodity.  As you have noted, anyone can make a substance worth something in the short term.  (Tulips)  The challenge, and the goal in my view, is to create a currency based on a backing which endures the long term, and the unthinkable (collapse of a major government or some such).
When the value of the intrinsic worth of a commodity in question does become apparent is in periods of transition, flux, disorder, or strife.  The security of a currency is going to be a major factor, especially immediately following introduction, to its popularity- except in unusual circumstances (tulips, market distortions, etc.)
I'm not sure this is precisely true.  While gold itself might not be the best choice, the general principal that a commodity based currency is less secure or trustworthy than a government backed one (even a powerful and imposing government) is not one I'm prepared to endorse without I believe this correct.
Just like diamonds.
Again, while the commodity itself (gold) may not be appropriate, I don't believe this ends the argument.
Which suggests that private currencys must utilize e-cash (if at all) merely as monetary instruments which continue to look much like what exists today.  (e.g., drafts, checks, bonds...)
I concur.
I concur again.
Yet here I must differ.  I'm still not convinced that a legitimate commodity somewhat resistant to the market distortions you cite does not exist.  Don't ask me what it is yet, I'll have to give it some thought.

So are bearer bonds, stock warrants, coupons...
  It is untraceable; there is no way to
Ditto above.
There are any number of bearer instruments that are not "currency."
Not technically true unless it is specifically structured this way.  It's more of a bearer draft.  Because digital cash is a token used by the bank to represent currency, which is backed by a government, digital cash, in it's current form, is a second tier bearer instrument.
This is so of checks too, but the processing time gets in the way.
See above.
Ditto uncashed checks.
Actually, it looks more like circulating dcash is a subset of outstanding obligations.  Same as, e.g., letters of credit.
Making a check payable to "cash" makes it, for practical purposes, a bearer But instead of backing in gold, or some tangible asset, dcash is still ultimately backed by the full faith and credit of the government who's currency the dcash is denominated in.
I still think the essential issue here is the manner in which the ecash is based.  If it is based on government currency, the U.S. dollar, then it is still just a second tier bearer instrument.
I think that the diet coke backed cash I tried to promote back when was closer to a "currency" than d/ecash issued by a bank and drawable on government currency.  (Maybe this is why no one was interested?)
Real solid ecash, and the kind of cash I would like to see out there, would be limited to a non-dilutable one time issuance and backed in some precious commodity held on reserve.  A closed-ended share of a stock of gold, for instance.  That would require no intermediation of a "currency" based on the full faith and credit of an issuing sovereign.
Private currencies are not private currencies at all if they have to be linked to a government issued denomination.

You clearly don't understand.  You are an ass making an assumption that a court cares or believes that the witness can actually produce the requested information or not.  Fines tend to be imposed regardless.
Contempt charges do operate world wide.  The reach of U.S. jurisdiction is very extensive and the United States generally doesn't care what the foreign jurisdiction thinks of it.
See my large note on asset concealing.
The same way no one creates Panamanian companies with their own name.  So what?  Third parties are still fined heavily.
 It would be a simple And simpler for courts to fine them out of existance (which happened to several banks, trust companies and agents in Cayman and Panama).
   Even They need only suspect or have reason to suspect it might be exculpatory.
Practically speaking this means convincing a judge.  Not hard when the words "offshore holding company" are mentioned in a brief or hearing.
In short, go to law school, then try to talk about legal issues.
Without getting into semantics, and "efficient identification system" implies one that identifies people efficently.  Blocking government use, or limiting it to certain circumstances is not efficiency.
Opinions are like assholes....

This will be my last comment on this thread.  Mr. Bell is beginning to lapse into the "yadda yadda yadda" phase.  Constructive progress becomes nil at this point typically.
My judgment is not important.  What I have seen courts do is.
I never claimed anything so broad.  I pointed out that the examples you gave (tipping off the offender that he was being investigated, creating provisions to destroy or otherwise make unavailable evidence material to a criminal or civil investigation), were going to have to confront these Mostly because there is no distinct line.  You make your argument to the judge, he makes his ruling based on his perceptions and bias.  Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.  When "offshore holding agent" or "trustee" is mentioned in the context of "unavailable" evidence, judges are not very patient.  Of course, your only response to this is "so kill them."  Unfortunately, in the absence of your system, that's not much of an option.
I don't talk to feces on the sidewalk either.
No, that's not the question.  This question you just invented.  The question was, and specifically in reference to your "rosebud" tip-off scheme, can an escrow agent warn the principal of an impending investigation with the intent of facilitating the destruction or diversion of material evidence.
Of course, having this scheme debunked forced you to alter the facts, yet again, to favor you.
Again, you have to convince the judge of all this, and even if it is true, he doesn't have to buy it, can still impose fines, and can still jail the third party until he is convinced he/she is either telling the truth, or is very determined no to release the information at any cost to Even if you can show that the third party is faultless, the principal is probably going to suffer the same fate.
The only way to do anyhting about the "current problems" in society is to kill and threaten?  Move to East Turkey.

I thought I would take the time to let everyone know that this is baseless as well.  Most jurisdictions forbid third parties to reveal prosecution inquries to the principal for which they are holding documents or other information.  A VERY few have laws on the books that require this disclosure.  Switzerland is no longer one of them.
Even if a judge was convinced by the defense not to levy heavy fines against a third party who pleaded that he or she was simply unable to comply, informing the principal would literally assure such fines would be imposed regardless.  Criminal charges of obstruction could easily attach.  Obstruction in connection with narcotics cases or other major felonies are generally extraditable offenses as well.
Once again Mr. Bell pulls legal analysis out of his rectum rather than basing it in fact or research.

While direct crypto relevance is limited, I thought that this work might interest many on the list and so I decided to post it in any event.  The sections on fourth and fifth amendment protections, or lack thereof, for banking documents might shed some light on the eventual disposition of crypto keys under the same circumstances.
This text represents a sanitized and >heavily< modified version of scholarly work I recently published.  I should also mention that portions of the original work have been subjected to official review prior to publication.  For the purposes of posting to the list, and to conceal my identity, I changed the note to approach things from the perspective of the asset concealer.  Although this wouldn't have gone over well when submitted for a scholarly publication, it better represents the way I think about these issues.  Given the nature of the "legitimate" scholarly work that predates it and its subject matter, this note seemed the logical extension, and I found myself a bit carried away with it before I was done.  In this regard the below is a more honest and complete picture of asset protection than the scholarly work, or probably than any other publication floating about right now.
And it's just for you cypherpunks, for the moment.
Unfortunately, after completing the work I began to realize that many sections were inappropriate for general release.  As a result several source cites that survived review have been removed, but I have tried, where able, to keep the majority of the substantive material present.  When I felt the need to remove substantive portions it was either to prevent exposing what I believe to be novel methods, because I consider the sections work product which I would like to continue utilizing effectively, or to protect those methods I know to be utilized by my associates.  To prevent misunderstandings, where large portions (more than a few lines) or crucial elements have been removed, I have so indicated with empty brackets. ("[]" and "[...]").
I've segmented the note.  I'll consider posting the second, third and forth volumes if there's enough interest.  As they involve some of the more sensitive issues, I'm not sure yet if I'm willing to release them generally, with more deletions, or at all.
If it gets to you garbled, mail me, I'll send you another copy.

I.  Introduction
While there has been much writing on "tax shelters," money laundering, and the use of the international business corporation to "judgment proof" assets, I've seen little discussion of the practical considerations in shielding assets effectively, especially for the United States resident.  With all the seminars, and "insider's guides" to the various jurisdictions and their incentives, there exists a significant amount of disinformation floating about.  I thought I would take the time to dispel some of the rumors and myths about asset protection and try to give a practical view that is sorely lacking in any of the common or scholarly literature on the subject.  The following work will examine these issues in more detail.  Part II will examine very briefly the uses of the offshore "tax haven."  Part III will consider some of the legal aspects confronting the asset concealer.  Part IV will examine some of the more esoteric issues and attacks on the asset concealer. Part V will take a closer look at some jurisdictions.  Part VI will draw some conclusions, provide a step by step guide for constructing asset concealing organizations and make some predictions for the future.
II.  Use of the Offshore Haven
Most people assume that the amount of the underground economy is fairly small and that offshore banking is entirely too complicated for the everyday person to deal with.  This is patently false.
Even as early as 1979 estimates of illegal money flowing through the Caribbean tax havens alone was in excess of fifty billion dollars a year.  The Use of Offshore Tax Havens for the Purpose of Evading Income Taxes: Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Oversight of the House Committee on Ways and Means, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (1979).  One estimate at the time attributed $25 billion a year to the Bahamas alone.  Illegal Narcotics Profits: Hearings Before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 474 (1979) (Exhibit No. 33, Offshore Banking: Issues With Respect to Criminal Use, Submitted to the Ford Foundation, Nov. 1979, by Richard Blum and John Kaplan).  In 1978, the Bahamas held $95.2 billion in foreign assets, a mere $1.8 billion of which was used to finance foreign trade.  Douglas J. Workman, The Use of Offshore Tax Havens for the Purpose of Criminally Evading Income Taxes.  Today the Cayman Islands have a population of 30,000, over 500 banks and some $415 billion of assets on deposit.
All one must do to take advantage of an offshore tax haven is get the money offshore and design a vehicle to use it where you live.  The techniques used to accomplish these goals are as varied as the creativity of the asset concealer.  Even so, and while any treatment of this subject must almost by definition be incomplete, some of the more apparent aspects and methods are touched on below:
A) Moving money offshore:
Obviously, a cash producing business could easily stream funds overseas without much auditing liability.  Follow this simple 1. Put cash in pocket.
2. Get on plane to offshore jurisdiction.
3. Deposit cash.
4. Return.
Or in the case of non-cash businesses:
American Business ("Biz") is owned by U.S. Citizens 1-3.  Business "expenses" for Biz are paid to a foreign corporation ("For1"), and deducted from Biz's corporate taxes.  While an audit might disclose these payments to the foreign corporation, it is fairly easy to shield them within the cost of goods sold.  If pressed, it is easy for Biz to claim that For1 and Biz are unrelated, and produce canceled checks and/or receipts to effect such proof.  For1 retains 10% of the payments from Biz, and passes the remainder to another foreign corporation ("For2").  An auditor will now have no direct access to records of the payments from For1 to For2, and indeed, the records may not even be in the country.
Biz could also claim to be paying for services rendered under contract by For1, where in actuality said services are being performed by Biz and claimed by Biz as business expense deductions.
B)  Bringing the money back.
Assume For2 is owned by a foreign offshore trust ("Trust") the beneficiaries of which are citizens 1-3.  Any investigation would be tasked to reveal the existence of this relationship or the flow of funds back to the citizens.  While for technical purposes these funds are held offshore, their presence in a U.S. bank in the name of Trust is certainly possible.
Wiser still, For2 could direct Trust to make a third foreign corporation ("For3") the 100% beneficiary, invest in U.S. securities through For3 (the capital gains of which are not technically taxable to foreign entities not connected to the United States).  Repatriating the assets is a simple matter accomplished either by situating For3 in a jurisdiction with a treaty waiving the withholding tax on dividends and interest (in past this has been the Netherland Antilles) or by drawing directly on the foreign accounts of For3 in such a way so as not to draw undue attention.
In past if Citizen 2 had some appreciated securities he would have sold them to Trust in return for an annuity with a carryover basis, or as an installment sale.  Citizen 2 would recognize only the annuity gain on the transaction because the gain will be realized by the offshore entity.  Obviously, the capital gain can be repatriated in the same way as above.
Citizen 3 lives and spends a great deal of money in the United States, but is already the subject of several large judgments in the country.  She instructs Trust to lease a new Ferrari, and obtain a secured Gold Mastercard in the trust's name from the bank administering Trust.  Citizen 3 can enjoy the fast life, draw massive cash advances as well as purchase anything she likes without income accountability.
Various complications can be included in any liberation/repatriation Tainted funds can be exchanged for large denomination bank notes in varied currencies, the notes exchanged for bank checks, bearer credit, or bearer bonds/certificates of deposit, or any liquid monetary instrument easy to travel with. (Uncut diamonds, precious metals or securities are all quite popular).  The goods are then transferred into another country and liquidated or stored.
While many of the legal loopholes have been filled with regard to the more public transactions, it becomes increasingly clear that asset concealing is an informational issue.  The more difficult one makes it for investigators to discover assets, trace their movement, or to attribute any of these things to the depositor, the more effective the asset concealing endeavor will be.  Asset concealing thus becomes a question of economics.  How much can the prosecuting authorities spend, how much time do they have, and is there any degree of suspicion to begin with?
     What to Look for in an Offshore Haven
III.  Legal Considerations for the Asset Concealer
     U.S. Discovery
       Compelled Consent Orders
Many people believe that foreign and domestic banks, particularly those situated in jurisdictions that criminalize such disclosure, will never release depositor's account information, assets, or related This too is patently false.  In fact, the United States has gone to lengths to make it difficult for foreign banks and fiduciaries to withhold such items from U.S. litigants.  Typically, heavy fines are imposed on banks refusing to comply with court orders compelling discovery of financial documents, even those located in foreign jurisdictions and where the disclosure imposes criminal and civil penalties on the disclosing bank.  Fines of $2 million are not without precedent.  (Unites States v. Bank of Nova Scotia, 740  F.2d 817, 832 (11th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1106 (1985)(upholding $25,000/day fine totaling $1,750,000 for failing produce documents located in the Cayman Islands under grand jury subpoena duces tecum; Marc Rich & Co., A.G. v. United States, 707 F.2d 663, 670 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1215 (1983)($50,000/day against Swiss corporation for noncompliance with subpoena duces tecum demanding documents located in Switzerland).  It should be very apparent that U.S. courts are not shy about imposing potent sanctions, even upon third parties, in order to facilitate plaintiffs and prosecutors access to documents and evidence.
On international discovery, See Generally, Note: Ordering Production of Documents from Abroad in Violation of Foreign Law, 31 U. Chi. L. Rev. 791 (1964); Note: Recent Developments in the Law Concerning the Foreign Illegality Excuse for Non-Production, 14 Va. J. Int'l L. 747 (1974); Note: Foreign Nondisclosure Laws and Domestic Discovery Orders in Antitrust Litigation, 88 Yale L.J. 612 (1979); Limitations on Concurrent Jurisdiction -- U.S. Court May Order Discovery of Foreign Documents, Notwithstanding Foreign Law, If Discovery Will Support National Policy, Is Vital to the Litigation, and May Be Accommodated by the Foreign Sovereign, 20 Va. J. Int'l L. 925 (1980); Rosdeitcher, Foreign Blocking Statutes and U.S. Discovery: A Conflict of National Policies, 16 N.Y.U. J. Int'l L. & Pol. 1061 (1984); Robinson, Compelling Discovery and Evidence in International Litigation, 18 Int'l Law. 533 (1984).
       Local Illegality
This puts many banks in dire straits as local jurisdictions can in turn impose powerful sanctions for complying with court ordered discovery in the United States.  See e.g., Bank and Trust Company Regulation Act of 1965, @ 10(3) (amended 1980)(Bahama Islands)(fine up to $ 15,000, prison term up to two years, or both); Art. 47, Bank G. (Switzerland)(fine up to $ 50,000 or prison term up to two years, fine to $ 30,000 for negligence); Montserrat Ordinance, No. 5 Section 5 (1980)(The Confidential Information Ordinance)(fine up to $ 5,000 and prison term up to two years for "nonprofessional person," fine up to $ 10,000 and prison term to four years for "professional person"); The Bank Secrecy Act, Art. 2 (Greece)(minimum of six months imprisonment with no possibility of suspended sentence, or imposition of fine).
is not only banks that can be fined for failure to disclose financial information.  Accountants, clerks, corporations, or literally any fiduciary, are subject to significant fines and incarceration in the United States for failing to comply with court ordered discovery.  Many of these "secondary" participants are targeted and, as often they have shallower pockets, are less able to bear the legal costs of defending against these powerful fines and, unlike banks, have less to lose in the way of reputation and client goodwill if they comply and disclose.  Given the lower fines and the infrequency with which criminal penalties are imposed on professionals so compelled, it is often to the advantage of the foreign document or evidence holder to disclose and risk the ire of local authorities rather than the notoriously vigorous U.S. courts.  Some U.S. courts have gone so far to indicate that banks unwilling to submit to the will of one or the other sovereign should "cease operation of the foreign branch."  See e.g., First Nat'l City Bank v. IRS, 271 F.2d 616 (2d Cir. 1959); United States v. First Nat'l City Bank, 396 F.2d 897 (2d Cir. 1968).  At least one court has not only acknowledged this dilemma, but wielded it as a policy measure, "...the defendant should feel the full measure of each sovereign's conflicting commands and so choose between laws of those two sovereigns."  Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Rio Algom, Ltd., 480 F. Supp. 1138 (N.D. Ill. 1979).
Generally speaking, there is little guidance for federal district courts, in which most of the litigation arises, as the only solid Supreme Court authority is Societe Internationale pour Participations Industrielles et Commerciales, 357 U.S. 197 (1958).  Courts, while a bit shifting in their doctrine, have tended to apply a few common considerations.  Factors indicating the United States interests at stake and the foreign entity's good faith attempts to comply with the court's order will both, almost without exception, be considered in reviewing the need for sanctions against foreign entities.  See Generally, Mark Brodeur, Note: Court Ordered Violations of Foreign Bank Secrecy and Blocking Laws: Solving the Extraterritorial Dilemma, 1988 U. Ill. L. Rev. 563.  What is concerning for the asset concealer is the meaning of the latter.  Good faith attempts to comply with a U.S. court order do not typically include refusal, however apologetic, on the grounds of local illegality or violation of general privacy considerations of the fiduciary's client.  In practice the balance between U.S. interests rarely, if ever, weighs in favor of the party resisting disclosure.  United States v. Davis, 767 F.2d 1025 (2d Cir. 1985); Bank of Nova Scotia I, 691 F.2d 1256 (11th Cir. 1982); Bank of Nova Scotia II, 740 F.2d 817 (11th Cir. 1984); United States v. Vetco Inc., 644 F.2d 1324 (9th Cir. 1981); State of Ohio v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 570 F.2d 1370 (10th Cir. 1978); United States v. Field, 532 F.2d 404 (5th Cir. 1976); Garpeg Ltd. v. United States, 583 F. Supp. 789 (S.D.N.Y. 1984); Compagnie Francaise D'Assurance pour le Exterieur v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 105 F.R.D. 16 (S.D.N.Y. 1984); Banca Della Svizzera Italiana, 92 F.R.D. 111 (S.D.N.Y. 1981)(All resulting in findings of bad faith on the part of the custodial agent).
       Foreign Offshore Jurisdictions Respond
Many foreign states have sought to eliminate the dilemma by enacting laws ("blocking statutes") re-enforcing banking secrecy.  Blocking legislation usually takes two forms.  Judgment blocking, which indicates that the enacting nation will simply not recognize certain foreign judgments, and discovery blocking, which prohibit disclosures for certain discovery requests.
It is interesting to note that much of the disagreement surrounding the efficacy of judicially compelled extraterritorial disclosure seems to revolve around a basic difference in approach for foreign states and U.S. Courts.  Mr. Brodeur, notes that foreign states usually find themselves concerned with the applicability of U.S. jurisdiction in their state and questions of sovereignty, where U.S. courts tend to feel that the "pertinent legal conflict" revolves around the general legitimacy of the compulsory disclosure orders themselves.  While the perspective of the United States is understandable, foreign states have a point.  Rare indeed is the U.S. court that bothers to assert jurisdiction based on the 'required' finding for extraterritorial extension of jurisdiction that the foreign entities activities have sufficient "effects" within its borders.  Brodeur notes further that there is little precedent in international law for compelled discovery orders and that many states protest such orders consistently.  See, International Law Association, Report of the Fifty-First Conference 407 (1964), documenting the protests of, e.g., Denmark, the United Kingdom, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Greece, and the Netherlands.  Most foreign states view their active resistance to U.S. policy as a preservation of their own sovereignty and policy.  See, Rosenthal & Yale-Loehr, 16 N.Y.U. J. Int'l L. & Pol. 1075, 1080 (1984); Comment: Foreign Blocking Legislation: Recent Roadblocks to Effective Enforcement of American Antitrust Law, ARIZ. ST. L.J. 945 (1981).
Given the above, the asset concealer will want to select an entity located in a jurisdiction with strict banking secrecy law and, ideally, one which has enacted legislation blocking compelled discovery.  Such legislation will give the investor an idea of the local policy and posture vis-a-vis the United States and compelled discovery generally.  Lists of such jurisdictions are somewhat difficult to come by but the generally accepted (if dated) authority on the subject is E. Chambost, Bank Accounts -- A World Guide to Confidentiality 93-259 (1983).  Chambost lists comprehensive treatments of 44 countries that provided banking secrecy in 1983.  More recent publications include Grundy's Tax Havens, Tolley's Tax havens, and the superior Practical International Tax Planning by Marshall Langer.  This publication is updated quarterly and if a comparable alternative exists publicly, I am unaware of its existence.
Among the more robust of the listed countries are Great Britain, South Africa, Australia, Germany, France, Italy, Denmark, Japan, Portugal, Sweden, Belgium, Spain, Finland, Mexico, Norway, the Netherlands, Andorra, Bahrain, Hong Kong, the British Virgin Islands, Guernsey, Luxembourg, Isle of Man, Russia, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Vanuatu, Panama, Singapore, Switzerland, Lebanon, Malaysia, Nauru, Austria, Costa Rica, Klienwalsertal, Jungholz, St. Vincent, the Turks and Caicos Islands.
The surest and longest standing banking secrecy jurisdictions have historically been Austria, The Cayman Islands, The Bahamas, Switzerland, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Liechtenstein, and Panama.  Unfortunately, with the growing EC/EU membership, Austria and Switzerland have begun to lean away from their strict banking secrecy and I personally find these jurisdictions to be a bit risky, especially given Switzerland's recent legislation and adoption of the latest round of banking reform treaties with the United States, which I will treat later.  While the treaty is not in full release as of this writing I am able to disclose that it deals, among other things, in detail with Banking Secrecy compromises.
Jurisdictions in which I found significant discovery blocking statutes include: The United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, South Africa, Sweden, and Switzerland.
Jurisdictions with judgment blocking which I consider sufficient include the United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and South Africa.  The most powerful blocking statutes, (as in the United Kingdom) provide for the private recovery against the disclosing party of funds lost as a result of violation of the statute.  The cautious asset concealer will seek such a jurisdiction.  It is wise to keep in mind, however, that many jurisdictions do not have explicit blocking statutes on the books and yet are as secretive, or indeed, more secretive than those which do.  Vanuatu is a good example of such a jurisdiction.
Still other jurisdictions find their basis for banking secrecy in common law.  Hong Kong: based on, Tournier v. National Provincial & Union Bank of England, 1 K.B. 461 (C.A. 1924); Anguilla, Antigua, Barbados, Bermuda, Montserrat, St. Vincent, the Turks and Caicos Islands, (Fedders, Waiver by Conduct -- A Possible Response to the Internationalization of the Securities Markets, 6 J. Comp. Bus. & Cap. Market L. 1, 30 (1984) are among these.
The dedicated asset concealer will take note that discovery and judgment blocking statutes, unlike banking secrecy laws, are not waivable by banking customers.  If placed in custody by local authorities to effect compliance, the depositor will be unable to effect his or her own release by instructing the foreign institution to surrender the requested documents or information.  Almost all such blocking statutes require express governmental authority for disclosure.  The hard core concealer will recognize, however, that many judges will be more sympathetic to the defendant who is unable to comply, even in good faith, and may refuse to impose incarceration for contempt as a result.  While a factor, relying on the good graces of the judge overseeing a proceeding involving the magnitude of assets likely to be present is probably ill advised.  Some jurisdictions refuse to acknowledge the instructions of asset holders held against their will.  Others will refuse to acknowledge judicially compelled consent orders.  (The Cayman Islands).  Still others will refuse to release documents or funds unless the asset holder or fiduciary signs a form personally in the offshore jurisdiction (which does not have extradition treaties).
An array of anti-duress, coercion and compulsion provisions are available from the more creative fiduciaries.  For example, duress code words triggering the transfer of assets to a separate random jurisdiction at the trustee's discretion, or into the care of a unnamed third trustee.  In the latter instance, the first trustee can plausibly deny any knowledge of the assets disposition.  One arrangement I am fond of is illustrative of the range of options available to the innovative designer.  Client A expects difficulties with local law enforcement.  If Client A's attorney learns of his arrest or detention, he is instructed to call the trustee managing A's assets.  The trustee, when notified, would collect the documents from his office, walk across the street and deposit the documents in a drop box at a neighboring trust company.  The trustee would then phone the neighboring trust company and notify one of the managers of the document deposit.  The manager of the neighboring trust company would select a nominee at random and instruct him to assume the duties entailed by the documents in the drop box.  In this way, even if traced to the original trustee the assets are now managed and assumably have been transferred by an entirely different trustee who is unknown to the first.  In the event A is released, he need only accompany the original trustee to the neighboring trust company to reclaim his assets.
Those countries which have statutes that U.S. courts have recognized as criminalizing disclosures tend to represent the most stringent tested blocking law examples.  These include Mexico, (Securities & Exch. Comm'n v. Minas de Artemisa, S.A., 150 F.2d 215, 218 (9th Cir. 1945) and Panama, In re Chase Manhattan Bank, 297 F.2d 611, 612-13 (2d Cir. 1962).  After 1962, most courts refused to take judicial notice of the legality of disclosure in the foreign jurisdiction as it is currently considered irrelevant to the proceedings.
While many of the statutes enacted to counter aggressive United States discovery practices are based on the increasing anti-trust litigation in the 1970's, anti-trust law is beyond the scope of this note.  For a detailed treatment See e.g., I E. Nerep, Extraterritorial Control of Competition Under International Law 54-162 (1983).
The most important distinction in the appellate cases which have denied motions to compel discovery of foreign documents in the face of the foreign states criminalization of such disclosure, e.g., Ings v. Ferguson, 282 F.2d 149 (2d Cir. 1960) First Nat'l City Bank v. IRS, 271 F.2d 616 (2d Cir. 1959) is that in both of these instances the entities holding the documents or discovery information were not themselves were not parties to the litigation.  See, e.g., Ings at 152 (citing fact that custodian of records was not a party to the litigation as a prominent factor in its reasoning).  The astute asset concealer will not use his concealing bank to, e.g., trade securities illegally, and thus involve the concealing bank in the litigation.  Still, it should be noted that the existence of an agency relationship provides an easy out for courts determined to compel discovery and the easiest way to assure that ones concealing institution is not named in a suit is to conceal the identity of the institution in the first While jurisdictions which have active blocking statutes requiring governmental authority for a financial institution to release depositor information or documents are probably safest, courts at one time held that compelling a defendant depositor to actually instruct a bank to disclose his financial records violates his fifth amendment rights.  See In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 814 F.2d 791 (1st Cir. 1987).  Fifth amendment rights will be discussed more fully below.  Generally speaking, the asset concealer should avoid relying on the fifth amendment absent extraordinary circumstances.  For a full and detailed treatment of the fifth amendment non-applicability in cases involving judicially compelled document production, See Gordon Hwang, Note: Fisher v. United States: Compelled Waiver of Foreign Bank Secrecy and the Privilege Against Self-Incrimination, 56 Fordham L. Rev. 453 (1987)(Concluding that "the act of producing a consent directive... does not violate a witness' fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination").
     Are High Profile Offshore Centers to be Avoided?
Further considerations for the U.S. asset concealer relate to the Cayman Islands and like jurisdictions.  For some time American citizens traveling frequently to the Cayman Islands have experienced increased law enforcement and tax scrutiny.  While I won't speculate as to the existence of a "black list," the glorious war on drugs has assured that The Cayman Islands and her visitors have, on occasion, attracted more law enforcement attention than the prudent asset concealer would want to endure.
In addition, both the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands have signed Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties ("MLATS") with the United States.  Though the Bahamian and Cayman MLATs both have important restrictions on information relating to tax matters, the Bahamian treaty, requires assistance in tax matters where the "offense" involves narcotics, theft, violence, or dual crimes.  The Cayman MLAT excludes tax and currency offenses not relating to another criminal matter.
An excellent source for current high profile banking secrecy jurisdictions can be the periodic study by the Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, "Use of Offshore Banks and Companies."
     The Goals of the Asset Concealer and Selection of Jurisdiction
       Tax Cases
The reason for secrecy is terribly important in deciding jurisdiction.  Of course, most litigation on the subject is with reference to taxation actions.  Jurisdictions with favorable laws for the "tax problem" depositor have traditionally included Switzerland, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Bahrain, and Hong Kong.  See Generally Crinion, Information Gathering on Tax Evasion in Tax Haven Countries, 20 Int'l Law. 1209 (1986)(analysis of law and practice of obtaining evidence from abroad in IRS investigations).  Switzerland, however, has leaned away from providing shelter to U.S. depositors accused of tax evasion.  While in practice Switzerland has been reluctant to disclose the information of depositors engaged in tax litigation with the United States and other nations, pressure from the U.S. has moved Switzerland, grudgingly, to comply in many of these cases.  Banking secrecy in Switzerland remains more stringent in other areas, but her deference to the United States is disturbing.
       Securities Issues
Securities litigation is probably the next most frequent category of case involving international discovery and the compelled discovery of documents.  Blocking and secrecy laws of those countries with robust legislation will protect the asset concealer concerned with this area.  Many countries which have signed agreements with the United States, notorious for its excessively energetic securities regulation, still have found ways to avoid complete compliance through treaty loopholes.  Of particular note, with my previously expressed reservations about newly emerging agreements, is the Swiss accord, The United States-
Swiss Treaty on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters 27 U.S.T. 2019, T.I.A.S. No. 8302 (1977) which is fairly typical of such agreements.  Because the Swiss agreement requires that the alleged acts which are the subject of the litigation spurring discovery be illegal in Switzerland as well as the prosecuting nation, and because some U.S. and other securities violations do not expressly "contravene" Swiss law, the Swiss treaty is, in extremely limited circumstances, an open tunnel for non-disclosure.  See Generally, Brodeur supra.
Offshore entities are particularly useful in active trading for the asset concealer anticipating securities regulation problems.  Problems with the SEC's Enforcement of U.S. Securities Laws in Cases Involving Suspicious Trades Originating from Abroad, H.R. Rep. No. 1065, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 2-6 (1988).  The sheer volume of international trading on the large U.S. markets provides an excellent opportunity for securities traders to become a "drop in the bucket."  Reported purchases of stock in the United States by foreign entities were $41.8 billion as early as 1982.  Swiss banks alone may account for as much as 20% of the trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange.  Siegel, United States Insider Trading Prohibition in Conflict with Swiss Bank Secrecy, 4 J. Comp. Corp. L. & Sec. Reg. 353, 357 (1983).  Because the enforcement of securities laws within the United States has been so dependent on disclosure and the open identity of the traders, many have used this "weak link" to avoid unwanted attention by trading from anonymous or nearly anonymous accounts abroad.
Some jurisdictions continue to provide a measure of safety against outside investigation of fraudulent and illicit trading through blocking and privacy statutes, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Luxembourg, and the Cayman Islands are the best examples. See Generally, Rochelle G. Kauffman, Note, Secrecy and Blocking Laws: A Growing Problem as the Internationalization of Securities Markets Continues, 18 Vand. J. Transnat'l L. 809, 819-26 (1985)(discussing countries with blocking statutes and the effect  of these laws on the SEC); Yvonne G. Grassie, Recent Development, Foreign Bank Secrecy and Disclosure Blocking Laws as a Barrier to SEC Policing of Transnational Securities Fraud, 65 Wash. U. L.Q. 259 (1987)(discussing judicial and administrative efforts to deal with blocking statutes).
Occasionally, where suspicious trading originates from a country such as Panama, Luxembourg, or Liechtenstein with blocking or secrecy statutes and no bilateral agreements with the United States, the SEC takes no investigative action.  See Grassie. at 11 (statement of Mr. Mountjoy).  Where a bilateral agreement exists, the Commission is often reluctant to invoke less it "wear out its welcome" with the host country.  Id. at 12-13 (investigation into suspicious trading through Swiss banks in which conclusive indications that U.S. securities laws had been violated existed still resulted in no request information to the Swiss authorities).
Identifying foreign owners can be virtually impossible when ownership must be traced through bearer shares, such as those issued by Liechtenstein Anstalts,  or when ownership is held through accounts in jurisdictions with iron clad bank secrecy laws.  See, e.g., Ingo Walter, The Secret Money Market 185-237 (1990) (emphasizing use of secrecy jurisdictions as means of avoiding detection and enforcement); Marc C. Corrado, Comment, The Supreme Court's Impact on Swiss Banking Secrecy: Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatialle v. United States  District Court, 37 Am. U. L. Rev. 827, 829-31 (1988)(reviewing Swiss domestic policy rationales for bank secrecy); Michael Getler, Europe's Ultimate Tax Haven, Wash. Post, Jan. 15, 1978, at H5; Liechtenstein; Coming Clean, The Economist, Apr. 26, 1980, at 59; Steve Lohr, Where the Money Washes Up, N.Y. Times, Mar. 29, 1992, at 27 (Magazine); John Wicks, A Tax Haven Where Companies Outnumber the Population, Fin. Times, Aug. 24, 1984, at 8.  To deal with the challenges posed by foreign ownership and trading, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has negotiated an intricate web of treaties and memoranda of understanding.  See, e.g., Richard M. Phillips & Gilbert C. Miller, The Internationalization of Securities Fraud Enforcement in the 1990s, 25 Rev. Sec. & Commodities Reg. 119 (1992).  Switzerland now often conditions permission to trade on U.S. securities markets with a waiver of secrecy.

@_subject: So, what crypto legislation (if any) is necessary? 
(Snore)  How many cases do you want me to cite that hold that the disclosure of an inquiry with the intent of evasion is conspiracy and entails criminal charges?
Do you honestly think you can evade prosecution for suborning the destruction of material evidence in a criminal trial?
Unfortunately, by the time (in the case of domestic investigations, and foreign investigations in more compliant jurisdictions) it gets to the point where authorities are checking about, they will have walked into the ISP and personally requested the information with subpoena in hand.  Perhaps the ISP with the nerve to destroy material evidence in the presence of law enforcement exists, but I sincerely doubt this ISP will escape serious prosecution for doing it.  At the very least the employees of the ISP will have knowledge of this practice.  Unless it's a single person run ISP, I doubt you're going to be able to keep everyone from testifying.  What you propose is a crime in the United States, and in many foreign jurisdictions.
I have often noted that the best defense is the lack of detection in the first place.  Unfortunately this is the oft denounced "security through obscurity."  Look, I know it's fun to imagine you can thwart the authorities with impunity within the United States.  Unfortunately it is a fantasy.  The system you propose requires someone to be present in the ISP 24 hours a day.  It requires some method of getting word to the operator who will trigger the alarm both that an investigation is looming, and who it entails.  It requires someone to talk to the authorities and stall them while the message is sent.  It requires you to be sitting at the screen when the message is received (perhaps this isn't a problem for Mr. Bell), or to get home before the law enforcement officials get a 2 hour warrant and open your door.
  Don't underestimate the significance of such Your last resort in all of your arguments seems to be murder, extortion, the threat of bodily harm, arson or assault, or destruction of private No.  I speak from experience when I say that "proof" of complicity is rarely a requirement.  The judge need only suspect wrong doing.  It's easy to levy contempt fines, and very hard to overturn them.  The standard in most jurisdictions is "clearly erronious."  Tough stuff.
Unfortunately, fines and penalities are imposed every day based on assumptions by the trier of fact.  Go watch a major court case some time.
And will.  I've seen this happen.  Trustee refuses to produce documents, court imposes compelled discovery, documents burn or are lost or have been stolen, trustee (who can be assigned no direct evidence of complicity) is fined heftily.  A case I was not personally involved in saw the judge jail the trustee for 4 months.
Attorneys are likely to lose their licenses, same with trustees.
See above.  Happened.  Been there.  Seen that.
Yadda yadda yadda.
So again, we see Mr. Bell in his basic form.  Violent offender.  He will obtain by force that which he cannot argue into his hands.

Ok, forget "entails" try "is a crime."
As for strong arming, ever see a search warrant served at a law firm or a trust company, or a bank?
What you miss are provisions for the preservation of evidence called for in the order during the hearing process.  The fact that you can fight a subpoena has no bearing what-so-ever on the fact that its a crime to destroy the evidence until the court rules that its non-material or otherwise quashes the subpoena.
I grow tired of being the source of your continuing legal education.
Anyone who knows me knows I spend all my days end arounding the U.S. government.  The reason you can't see that is because I don't threaten to murder officials, but choose the intellectual detour around the myopic laws instead.  I realize that, lacking the facilities to pursue the latter, you must resort to the former.
See above.  Has no bearing on the willful destruction of evidence.
What is the function of your elusive super-secret "rosebud" warning then?  To tell the account holder to get a cup of coffee and call the prosecutor to arrange for the delivery of the sought information?
Subjecting the target to compelled discovery orders $50,000+/day fines, contempt charges, and incarceration for non-compliance.  This, by the way, regardless of the "incriminating" nature of the evidence.  Fines are not going to be refunded if the data/evidence is later proved immaterial.
Again, this still subjects the account holder to fines etc.  God help him if he can't produce the desired information.  He's likely to spend quite a long time in jail until the judge is convinced that he's telling the truth when he says "I threw away the key."
I don't dread it at all.  I simply recognize the limited protection it affords the evidence concealer.
I certainly won't endorse moronic schemes that are so out of touch with practical and legal reality so as to be laughable.  I will certainly not keep quiet when I see, yet another, misleading out-of-rectum-pulled plan to evade all liability in the most pervasive and coercive jurisdiction in the world.
Word to the wise reader:  If you're considering asset / informational protection from discovery or attachement, by all means consult a professional.  Mr. Bell's disinformation and illusions are dangerous in the extreme.
The what's the purpose of your secret-super-duper "rosebud" warning?  In the absence of evidence/information availability to law enforcement at the ISP, the account holder will be directly accountable.  Is this a better solution?
You've now changed the structure of your "protection" scheme four times to duck my criticisms.  This was the same with your inventive but impractical nuclear detonation scheme, and your kill-the-pigs "dead pool" On the part of the ISP, this is possible.  A secret "rosebud" tipoff is not the way to do it.  Your constant encryption option is a bit better, but still subjects the account holder to an investigation where the ISP is compelled to cooperate with the authorities in secret and intercept or record the computing session in real time.  Your fourth scheme is thus reliant on the trust-worthiness of the ISP, which I have indicated, and you have acknowledged by your constant ranting about the abuses of the justice system, is dubious at best.
Unfortunately, records can only be completely destroyed in a pre-emptive way when they are of no use any longer.  This, again, ignores the possibility of real-time investigation or informers.
  While courts will look askance Once suit is filed there is.
No, instead, knowing of this provision, any plaintiff or prosecutor will apply for a TRO to preserve evidence before ever filing for a warrant.  Review: Fines and contempt that can be leveled for non compliance on third parties.
This argument will go over real well in court.
Uh, not precisely so.  Lots of circumstances exist where your home can be searched without a search warrant.  Search of premises incident to a lawful arrest is just one of them.
Yadda yadda yadda.
I don't like it because it's not a solution, because it's not novel, and because courts, law enforcement, prosecutors and private litigants have thought of it already and created provisions to prevent it.
[description of problems with Mr. Bell's scheme removed]
You told me nothing.  You hedged, changed your scheme, altered the portions I attacked and revered to a previous scheme I had already decimated.
And you made several legal analysis errors, as usual, in the process.
So you might as well murder a few people.  Why not?
Contracts are void to the extent they are illegal.  Obstruction is illegal.  Destruction of material evidence to a crime is illegal.  Conspiracy to obstruct justice is illegal.
Yadda yadda yadda.
Who said I didn't oppose it?  I just don't kill people, or call for their death (other than by suicide) to accomplish my goals.
My note contains many.  Consider a pair:
Unites States v. Bank of Nova Scotia, 740  F.2d 817, 832 (11th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1106 (1985)(upholding $25,000/day fine totaling $1,750,000 for failing produce documents located in the Cayman Islands under grand jury subpoena duces tecum; Marc Rich & Co., A.G. v. United States, 707 F.2d 663, 670 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1215 (1983)($50,000/day against Swiss corporation for noncompliance with subpoena duces tecum demanding documents located in Switzerland).
In both cases the documents were not shown to be material evidence when the fines were imposed and the judge was merely assuming they would be I don't name specific cases I have been involved in without client waiver, but I have myself seen larger fines for less in white collar crime cases.
Yadda yadda yadda.

My hostility is for a system that allows mob mentality and murder run the streets like a bad day in Beruit.
Again, I don't consider fines assessed to deal with obviously complicit third parties to be abuse.  Your problem is you can't deal with authority without calling for murder.  Become an expatriate if you don't like the U.S.  Move to e.g., East Turkey.

@_subject: What backs up digital money? 
The solution is a series of a "coupon/token exchange."  One can imagine a service which does nothing but exchange all forms of coupons/tokens or, indeed, provides a fluid market for them a la "Idea Futures."
If a given coupon/token issuer wanted complete fluidity, he has merely to offer the coupons/tokens on the coupon/token exchange.  After a basic finding, the market will take care of the rest, including valuation.
This gives the individual issuer exchangability, to the extent the market percieves his coupons to be worth something.  Individuals not interested in their 'currency' being public could refuse to offer them on the exchange, or offer them on the exchange "blindly" without a description of their terms of redemption, and thus maintain an underground market in the tokens or coupons, used, one would assume, only by those who were familiar with the terms of redemption.
With an offshore exchange, this becomes almost a non-issue.  Particularly if encryption is used to mask exchanges.
Again, if you had an offshore entity which provided easy convertability to, e.g., e$ dollars, this becomes impossible to eliminate.
Anyone have the idea futures URL available?  The author should take a look at it.  Briefly, by offering "futures" contracts on ideas (queen mother dies by year 2000), one can get a market valuation of the legitimacy or likelihhood of this claims truth.
In the same way, a liquid exchange of tokens or coupons would provide fairly accurate valuations of the instruments.
All the exchange would have to do is provide token or coupon convertability into it's own tokens (exchange tokens, "etk"s) and then permit purchases of all the trading coupons or tokens in terms of exchange tokens.
e.g., assume currently one e$ is trading at 1etk.  Those wishing to buy "tacky tokens" with e$ need only purchase 1etk, then run their cursor down to the tacky token field and see that two tacky tokens are trading at 1etk.  Send the exchange their etk and get two tacky tokens.  (Of course, the exchange would be best off in demominating things in etk100,000's so as to collect a small exchange fee in their own currency The result might even be active trading in etk's.  Get an offshore bank involved, and you have real interesting stuff.
What I've proposed is just a local common exchange of sorts.  But it's only limited in so far as there are active users of the exchange.
The void to be filled will be as individuals see the advantages of minting their own currency.  My brain's tired.  Anyone want to spit some of these out?

@_subject: Note: Problems Confronting the Asset Concealer [Part 2 of 2 of Volume I] 
(Volume I - Part 2 of 2)
     The Constitution is of No Help.
The asset concealer who hopes to rely on the constitution to protect him might wish to consider the view of one noted scholar:
"The Constitution provides little protection for account holders.  Courts describe the interest of the United States in enforcing its laws as overwhelming and the ability of prosecutors to uncover evidence of criminal conduct as essential.  That interest usually overwhelms any possible constitutional right of a bank customer.  United States v. Miller rejected the Fourth Amendment's Search and Seizure Clause as a basis for a privacy right in bank records."  (Todd Jones, Compulsion Over Comity: The United States' Assault on Foreign Bank Secrecy, 12 J. Intl. L. Bus. 454), and cases since have followed this holding almost religiously.
As discussed briefly above, it is likewise unlikely that the fifth amendment will protect the asset concealer to any degree of certainty.  Several cases have held that fifth amendment rights do not apply to banking records or financial information.  Zicarelli v. New Jersey State Comm'n of Investigation, 406 U.S. 472, 478 (1972)(Banks and other institutions cannot invoke the self incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment); Braswell v. United States, 487 U.S. 99, 102 (1988); Bellis v. United States, 417 U.S. 85, 89-90 (1974).  On the fifth amendment concerns See Generally, Comment: Sidestepping Foreign Bank Secrecy Laws: No Sanctuary in the Fifth Amendment and Little in the Interest of Comity, 10 Hous. J. INT'L L. 57, 57 n.1 (1987).
Corporate entities have no Fifth Amendment protection at all by virtue of their agent status, Bellis v. United States, 417 U.S. 85, 89-90 (1974), and more and more such protection is withheld even if the corporate entity is a co-defendant.  Braswell v. United States, 487 U.S. 99, 102 (1988).  Exceptions may exist for those entities which are operated as sole proprietorships.  Braswell at 104 citing United States v. Doe, 465 U.S. 605 (1984).
The cases following In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 814 F.2d 791 (1st Cir. 1987) demonstrate how the fifth amendment has been eroded or eliminated in application to this problem.  In the In re case the defendant was directed by the district court to sign a consent form permitting the disclosure and production by a financial institution of documents protected by Singapore banking secrecy law.  On refusing to sign, the defendant was held in contempt.  The investigation alleged reporting and currency violations.  The defendant appealed to the First Circuit which held the signature as both "testimonial" and "self-incriminating."  The court reasoned that the consent form "amounts to an assertion" that the bank customer consented to production of the requested records and that it was "self-
incriminating" because it could be used to demonstrate incriminating facts (e.g., that the accounts in the witness's name existed and were within the witness's control).  Even at the time, however, this decision was in conflict with the Second, Fifth and Eleventh circuits, which have held such an order does not violate the fifth amendment.  (Typically on the grounds that the forms signed were non-testimonial).
Lately, clever prosecutors and private litigants have evaded the testimonial hitch entirely by phrasing their consent forms in the hypothetical, and not naming specific account names or numbers.  The Supreme Court upheld the order of contempt for a defendant refusing to sign such a document.  See, Doe v. United States, 108 S. Ct. 2341 (1988).  The Court noted that the form was carefully drafted not to make reference to a specific account, but only to speak in the hypothetical.  Compare the unconstitutional language of the In Re Grand Jury form:
"I [witness], consent to the production to the [District Court and Grand Jury] of any and all records related to any accounts held by, or banking transactions engaged in with, [bank X], which are in the name of, or on behalf of: [witness], if any such records exist."
with the now constitutional:
I, [witness], of the State of New York in the United States of America, do hereby authorize and direct any bank, trust company, or other financial institution located outside of the territorial United States at which I have or have had an account of any kind, or at which any corporation has or has had an account of any kind upon which I am or have been authorized to draw, to disclose all information and deliver copies of all documents of every nature in the possession or control of such bank, trust company, or other financial institution which relate to any such accounts, together with a certificate attesting to the authenticity of any and all such documents, to any agent or employee of the United States Government who presents a copy of this Consent Directive which has been certified by the Clerk of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York to such bank, trust company, or other financial institution, and this Consent Directive shall be irrevocable authority for doing so.  United States v. A Grand Jury Witness, 811 F.2d 114 (2d Cir. 1987).
For more examples See also, United States v. Davis, 767 F.2d at 1040 (holding any problem of testimonial self-incrimination is solved by such an order precluding use of directive as admission); In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 814 F.2d at 795 (expressly approving of reasoning in Davis); United States v. A Grand Jury Witness, 811 F.2d 114, 117 (2d Cir. 1987); United States v. Cid-Molina, 767 F.2d 1131, 1132 (5th Cir 1985); United States v. Ghidoni, 732 F.2d 814, 818 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 932 (1984); United States v. Browne, 624 F. Supp. 245, 248 (N.D.N.Y. 1985); United States v. Quigg, 48 A.F.T.R.2d 81-
5953, 5955 (D. Vt. 1981).
Even more importantly, the character of the "documents" themselves, public or private, electronic or paper, would seem to be a factor courts will refuse to consider.  Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 410-11 (1976) rejecting both an analysis based on the nature of documents and privacy as the policy supporting the fifth amendment.
Some protection still exists.  Many jurisdictions refuse to recognize "consent" orders signed under judicial compulsion.  See, In re ABC Ltd., 1984 C.I.L.R. 130 (1984) (Grand Court of the Cayman Islands)(Consent directives compelled under threat of contempt sanctions do not constitute consent under Cayman Bank Secrecy Law); In re Confidential Relationships (Preservation) Law, Law 16 of 1976, Cause No. 269 of 1984 (Grand Ct. Cayman Islands July 24, 1984).
IV. Esoteric Considerations
     Intelligence threats:
The asset concealer should note that financial institutions have increasingly become the target of foreign intelligence operations.  The IRS has conducted intelligence operations against foreign banks extensively in past and the scope of such operations in the present is unclear.  From 1965-1975 the intelligence division of the IRS's Jacksonville, Florida district conducted operations named "Tradewinds" and "Havens."  Both operations were designed to gather intelligence on American investors in offshore banking entities, and expose potential tax evasion and criminal activity.  Several IRS agents testified on the operations before the House Committee on Government Operations in the First Session 94th Congress, 1975.  In 1965, when the Bahamas enacted its bank secrecy legislation criminalizing the release of banking information, the IRS turned to paid informants within the banking community to elicit information about the banking activities of U.S. citizens, a tactic that violated Bahamian law.  The most dramatic of these was the "briefcase caper," wherein a female IRS informer "entertained" a Bahamian banker while her accomplice photocopied the contents of his briefcase. United States v. Payner, 434 F. Supp. 113 (N.D. Ohio 1977), rev'd, 447 U.S. 727 (1980)  The IRS finally ceased the operation in 1975 when it admitted that it had obtained information in violation of federal law.
The IRS has also shown a propensity for illicit information gathering from the mails.  time in the late 1960s, the IRS combed through mail to identify those U.S. citizens who received mail from Swiss Banks.  Though most Swiss banks at the time mailed their customers using unmarked envelopes, the IRS aggressively pursued traffic analysis in the mails.  Agents from the IRS mailed inquires to several Swiss banks and recorded the number of the postal meters used to respond.  These collected numbers were matched against international mails using high speed copiers at the port of entry and those matching the postal meter numbers were audited at "random."  The practice was later upheld in United States v. Leonard, 524 F.2d 1076, 36 (2nd Cir. 1975) cert. denied, 425 U.S. 958 (1976), and some 150 taxpayers were prosecuted.  Generally speaking, the Supreme Court has upheld the use of illegally obtained information in tax cases in United States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727 (1980).
Given the success of the IRS operations ($52,000,000 at a cost of $1,500,000 according to the hearings on Tradewinds and Haven) it is difficult to imagine that these methods have been entirely abandoned.  Moreover, the asset concealer should recognize that today private litigants have access to the most professional intelligence services themselves.  Organizations like The Investigative Group, Inc., Kroll, Pinkerton, and Control Risks, Inc. have recruited former investigative and intelligence professionals aggressively and offer their services to private litigants as a matter of course.  Given the forgoing the private banking option, below, becomes more and more attractive.
Pressure from the IRS alone is not the only concern that asset concealers might wish to consider.  Congress has more than once called for sanctions against banks that do not bow to the wishes of the United States.  Staff of Senate Subcomm. On Narcotics, Terrorism and International Operations, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., Drug Money Laundering, Banks and Foreign Policy 32 (Comm. Print 1990)  Given this, the serious asset concealer should consider using banks that hold no assets in the United States, and which do not conduct normal banking business in the United States, as these assets, or the banking charter generally, could easily be suspended, frozen, or revoked.
     The Anatomy of a Money Laundering Investigation
     Private banks
The asset concealer may also wish to consider the option of a private bank.  Private offshore banks provide individuals or small groups of investors with their very own financial institution.  This, of course, reduces the number of individuals with access to banking information, allows for the more direct control of records, and all but eliminates the potential for coercion of a large banking parent.  In addition, private banks create a captive source of loans for investors, provide additional funds at interbank rates, allow the payment of interest tax free, the participation in tax free international underwriting, assist clients in international trusts and corporation formation, and eliminate many overhead costs of banking.  If one can balance the costs and government fees of forming such a bank, they are the most secure and direct method of asset concealing.
Asset concealers who wish to pursue this option would do well to keep in mind that their choice of corporate form for their financial institution will impact their fifth amendment protections.  Braswell v. United States, 487 U.S. 99, 102 (1988)(Normal rule stripping fifth amendment protections from financial institutions refusing to comply with compelled discovery orders even when named as co-defendants may not apply for those entities which are operated as sole In the cases of securities related charges, where at one time charges could be filed solely on the basis of the defendants invocation of the fifth amendment in reference to questions about the existence of foreign bank accounts of financial dealings, in the absence of a direct connection, such an assertion alone is no longer enough to warrant an action.  See Comserv Corp., 698 F. Supp. at 789. (Absent other evidence assertion of Fifth Amendment privilege is "not a sufficient basis for the SEC's action." Id. See also Pagel, Inc. v. SEC, 803 F.2d 942, 946-47 (8th Cir. 1986)(citing Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 317 (1976)).
Until around 1965, establishing banks in the Bahamas and other islands was simple.  Forming a normal corporation and granting it banking powers was about the extent of the efforts required.  The Bahamas eventually tightened restrictions and while there are still over 350 banks on the island, establishing new entities is more difficult today.  The Cayman Islands followed suit in 1966, enacting legislation virtually identical to that of the Bahamas.  Additional legislation passed in 1989 modifies some of the 1966 rules.
While a "bank" is nearly impossible to organize in Bermuda today, finance companies can be organized to conduct some quasi-banking activities.  The most attractive, and least regulated of the major jurisdictions today are Turks and Caicos, and Vanuatu.  Turks and Caicos, while regulating "banks" a bit more strictly, allows almost unregulated formation of trust companies.  Vanuatu permits the formation of exempted banks, making it perhaps the most attractive jurisdiction for the asset concealer interested in forming his or her own financial institution.  To some extent is it possible to form a financial institution in Switzerland, but this has become increasingly difficult, and the highest standards for capital pay in and reputation make it prohibitively restrictive for most asset concealers.
Jersey, Luxembourg and Guernsey are other options, but all still impose strict regulations on the formation of new banks.  Luxembourg requires that the banking business be conducted locally, that the new bank be sponsored by two well established banks, and that at least 350 million Lux.F. be paid in prior to formation.  Panama still allows offshore bank creation with limited fees and a low paid in capital requirement of $250,000 which must be deposited locally.  New banks must generally be backed by large and reputable banks.  I remain suspicious of actual banking activities in Panama, however, considering the increased U.S. presence in the country since the ousting of her former dictator.
Netherland Antilles also allows formation of offshore banks which are generally treated like investment companies.  Offshore banks can be granted a flat tax of 6% on income and require only a 20% pay in of the capital requirement which is NAf 1 million.  (1NAf=$0.56 at the time of this writing).  Nauru permits offshore banks but a reputation requirement often prevents novice applicants from easy approval.  Nauru does, however, have very low licensing fees, which are usually not more than normal trading or holding corporations.
Shell banks (those without substantive assets of any kind) were popular until 1977.  They required no paid in capital and were commonplace in Anguilla and St. Vincent.  While technically such institutions no longer exist, some of the smaller jurisdictions have difficulty enforcing their capital and debt-equity ratio requirements, often creating "effective" shell bank opportunities after an initial showing of capital which is later removable.  For the prudent asset concealer, however, shell banks will present a less than desirable alternative to meaningful bank licenses in legitimate jurisdictions.
My own views aside, conventional wisdom holds that offshore banks are best formed in the Bahamas and Cayman Islands.  Both of these jurisdiction's license applications can exceed 100 pages.  Directors are generally required to offer proof of bona fide banking experience, officers, managers and shareholders required to make disclosures, and references checked.  In many cases, as with Vanuatu for example, stand-ins for officials, directors and managers are available through local trust services.  Initial capital statements are typically audited.  Paid in capital requirements are usually $250,000 or more.  The Cayman Islands and other jurisdictions allow substitution of capital for guarantees from reputable banks or trust companies.  Almost every jurisdiction requires annual license fees.
See Generally, Peat Marwick's numerous publications.
       Using Private Banks to your Advantage
       Bearer Shares
Bearer shares are an immensely useful tool to the asset concealer.  Bearer shares are certificates of equity ownership which are freely transferable and embody full ownership rights to the holder.  They do not bear the name of the shareholder or beneficiary and are not registered.  Bearer shares are generally numbered certificates with removable serialized coupons attached which can be exchanged for dividend payments, much like bond coupons.  Bearer shares with voting rights are generally tallied by deposit with a designated bank in exchange for corporate voting ballots issued by the bank before shareholder meetings.  Because Bearer shares are not registered, and entitle the holder to the full benefits of ownership, and because dividend coupons are detachable, a stockholder in the corporation can be completely anonymous and a distinct entity from those entitled to dividend payments.
Typically on formation trustees accept bearer shares in the corporation and later pass them to the actual shareholders who may in turn separate the dividend rights, transfer the shares, or both, to a third party.  In this manner the ownership of the corporation is almost entirely shielded.  Antigua, Barbuda, Liberia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Nauru, Netherland Antilles, Panama, Switzerland, and Turks and Caicos all permit bearer shares, as do Cayman and Vanuatu for exempted companies.
V. Reviews of Specific Jurisdictions
     Why I don't like Switzerland anymore
Not obscure enough.  Spineless.  Switzerland has, perhaps for legitimate reasons at first, attracted a tremendous amount of attention as a banking secrecy jurisdiction.  The astute asset concealer will avoid such jurisdictions where possible as they tend to attract suspicion and law enforcement attention.  For example, a 1981 study by Swiss National Bank and the public prosecutors office attributed 26 kidnapping incidents in 1970 and 1978 to Swiss money laundering elements in the ransom demands.  (Massnahmen gegen "Geldsauberung," Neue Zurcher Zeitung, (NZZ) May 9/10, 1981, No. 106 at 9).  High profile customers in Swiss banks have attracted so much public attention as to make the jurisdiction extremely high profile.  See, e.g., N. Schmid, Banken Zwischen Legalitat Und Kriminalitat 189-
191 (1986) (King Faisal of Iraq, King Faruk of Egypt, Algerian Liberation Front, Ex-Shah of Iran Pahlevi, and Presidents of Argentina, Kongo-Katanga, Nicaragua); Internationale Rechtshilfe - Gefahr fur das Bankgeheimnis, NZZ, Aug. 30, 1989, No. 200 at 21 (Marcos, Irangate, drug mafia); The Lifestyle of Rich the Infamous, FORTUNE, Dec. 2, 1988, at 38 (tax fugitive Marc Rich).  Cf. Nationalrat will scharferen Geldwascher-Artikel, Tages-Anzeiger, Nov. 28, 1989, No. 277 at 9 (statement of member of Swiss House of Representatives)("...no country can point to as many illegal banking transactions as Switzerland").
In 1977 a private agreement between the Swiss Bankers' Association ("SBA") and member banks of the SBA took effect.  The agreement establishes a duty of due care in the identification of potential account holders and depositors and is intended to reduce the incidence of rampid criminal activity through Swiss banks.  (Vereinbarung uber die Sorgfaltspflicht bei der Entgegennahme von Geldern unde die Handhabung des Bankgeheimnisses)(VSB 1977).  In addition, the Bankers' Agreement contains a stipulation that depositors wishing to trade on United States securities markets are required to waive their rights to secrecy as a condition to trading.  The SBA provides in detail for SEC investigations into securities violations involving Swiss banks.
The "Lebanon Connection," was the scandal that most turned the tables on Swiss banking secrecy.  (Allegations that several of Switzerland's major banks assisted Turkish-Lebanese drug ring over in the laundering of proceeds totaling over 1.6 billion francs.  Taglich eine Million Dollar gewaschen, Graber, Geldwascherei 42 (1990).  See also, Wichtiger als Geldwascher bestrafen ist die Verbrecherorganisation treffen, Tages-Anzeiger, Nov. 12, 1988, No. 265 at 33 (Lebanon Connection largest Swiss money laundering scandal to date); Geldwascherei: Dampf aufgesetzt, Schweizerische Handelszeitung (SHZ), Nov. 10, 1988, No. 45 at 17 (Illegal drug profits entered Switzerland on daily basis via couriers carrying briefcases filled with dollar bills in small denominations).
Immediately after, the Swiss Federal Council (Bundesrat) streamlined the typically lethargic elements of Swiss legislative efforts to criminalize money laundering, and the new legislation was approved by the Swiss Parliament to take effect August 1, 1990 P. Bernasconi, Grenzueberschreitende Wirtschaftskriminalitat, 83 Schweizerische Juristische Zeitung (Sjz) 73, 82 n. 24 (1987).  Cf.  P. Forstmoser & A. Meier/Hayoz, Einfuhrung in das Schweizerische Aktienrecht 329 (4th ed. 1989).  Under the law, money laundering crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to five years and by fines of up to one million Swiss francs.  (Scweizerisches Strafgesetzbuch, Code Penal Suisse, Codice Penale Svizerro, art. 47, 273).  Because the Mutual Assistance Treaty with the United States permits release of banking records to the United States in the event the activity is illegal in both countries, it would seem that money laundering investigations will grant prosecutors the right to request, and obtain Swiss banking Switzerland has gone on to eliminate the "Form B" account.   (permitting a proxy to vouch for the depositor, and effectively making the account anonymous subject to the proxy's trustworthiness.   Swiss Bankers Ass'n, Convention de Diligence Banquers, Form B (1987)).  As of April 25, 1991 Swiss banks are now required to record the identity of the beneficial owner of depositor accounts, leaving a wider paper trail for U.S. prosecutors.  According to one commentator, "In short, the United States now has an extremely powerful vehicle with which to pierce the veil of Swiss banking secrecy..."  Kanwar M. Singh, Nowhere to Hide: Judicial Assistance in Piercing the Veil of Swiss Banking Secrecy, 71 B.U.L. Rev. 847.
Even given the legislative tendency to erode Swiss secrecy, one must understand that the image Swiss banking secrecy has been much inflated in public opinion.  Swiss banks have become very conscious and wary of indiscriminately opening accounts which may be the subject of illegal funds receipt.  Swiss banks are increasingly reluctant to open new numbered accounts.  "Coded" accounts are typically granted only to current customers.  Truly "anonymous" accounts do not exist at all in Switzerland.  Instead, numbering is directed to avoid internal violations of banking secrecy and problems along the line of the Bahamas "briefcase caper." Honegger, Demystification of the Swiss Banking Secrecy and Illumination of the United States Memorandum of Understanding, 9 N.C.J. Int'l L. & Com. Reg. 1, 17 (1983).  In fact, contrary to popular belief, purely anonymous accounts do not exist at all in Switzerland. H. Bar, The Banking System of Switzerland 61 (1957).  At the very least one or more senior bank employees will know the depositor's identity.  Even in the case of Form B accounts, records of depositors were typically kept privately by higher officials in the bank.
When taken as a whole, the legislature's specific indication of its willingness to erode the protection of banking secrecy in Switzerland, the pending legislation, interest in EU membership, acceptance of the European Convention on Money Laundering, four other anti-secrecy laws recently passed in Switzerland along with the more intrusive internal policies of Swiss bankers, my interest in Switzerland as an asset concealing jurisdiction is much eroded.  See Generally, Rebecca G. Peters, Money Laundering and Its Current Status In Switzerland: New Disincentives for Financial Tourism, 11 J. Intl. L. Bus. 104 (1995).
For a defense of the current status of Swiss banking secrecy, however, See Paolo S. Grassi and Daniele Calvarese, The Duty of Confidentiality of Banks in Switzerland: Where it Stands and Where it Goes. Recent Developments and Experience. The Swiss Assistance to, and Cooperation with the Italian Authorities in the Investigation of Corruption Among Civil Servants in Italy (The "Clean Hands" Investigation): How Much is Too Much?
     Why I like Panama.
At one time, Panama was regarded as the leading tax and securities trading haven in the Western Hemisphere.  3 W. Diamond & D. Diamond, Tax Havens of the World, at Panama-1 (1989).  While the political upheaval and overthrow of Manuel Noriega have changed much, many aspects of Panamanian law remain friendly to the asset concealer.
Panamanian corporations have no minimum capital requirement, and registered shares are not required to be completely paid in.  While corporate law requires two shareholders for the purpose of electing a board of directors, (which can consist of only three persons, none of whom must own shares), after the board is elected the corporation may be reduced to one shareholder.  Ownership can be effectuated through bearer shares if they are fully paid in, and there are no citizenship requirements except for the appointment of a resident agent, who is generally the incorporating agent.
"Bearer shares" are well entrenched in Panamanian law.  They allow corporate ownership to be shielded quite effectively from identification by permitting the corporation fully transferability in private face to face transactions of nothing more than the corporate share certificates.  Typically, an agent handles incorporation, and exchanges the bearer certificates with the principal, who then may even exchange it with a second principal, completely shielding the final holder of the corporation from identification by the agent absent the cooperation of the first principal.  Bearer shares will be discussed more fully below.  In addition, Panama continues to maintain strict banking secrecy laws and no taxation of income produced from sources outside the country.  Large investors may enjoy the benefits of extensive  investment and capital incentives.  Banking Law of Panama, Law No. 16, Arts. 2-4 (Jan. 28, 1959).
These arrangements have particularly suited Panamanian corporations for discrete, indeed totally confidential, securities trading on U.S. markets.  Many traders have used Panamanian corporations extensively in this regard, and even where the existence of the corporations and their complicity in insider trading has been established, few investigations have been able to bear the burden required to secure convictions.  See, e.g., SEC v. Levine, Civ. Action No. 86-3726 (S.D.N.Y. filed May 12, 1986)(alleging defendant Levine made securities trades based on inside information through two Panamanian corporations beneficially owned and controlled by Levine) In re Joseph A. Lugo, Admin. Proc. File No. 3-6740 (Lexis, Securities library, Releases file)(May 10, 1988)(Panamanian bearer stock corporation involved in scheme to defraud investors); SEC v. Palmer Fin. Corp., Litigation Release No. 12,082, 43 SEC Docket 1230 (D.D.C. May 3, 1989) (violations of Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Exchange Act).
The combination of opaque ownership anonymity and non-cooperation with authorities even in criminal investigations makes Panama the ideal first tier expatriation jurisdiction, and an excellent re-investment Panama's entities will be discussed in more detail in the second "implementation case study" section below.
     Why I like Liechtenstein
I must disclaim my passage here by disclosing that I am personally involved in business, banking, and government in Liechtenstein.
Despite her neighbor's less than favorable bent, Liechtenstein remains a powerful jurisdiction for the asset concealer.  The primary vehicle employed is typically the Liechtenstein Anstalt, but Foundations and general trusts are also exceptionally effective.
Unlike Luxembourg and Dublin, Liechtenstein, by virtue of her disdain for EU membership, will not be burdened by the proposed standard EU withholding tax to which even Switzerland and the Channel Islands may eventually be subject.  Though the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are technically outside the EU area, many point to their presence within the "sterling area" as dangerous with regard to the proposed tax's reach.  Liechtenstein is also much easier to reach than most island offshore havens.
Perhaps best of all, foreign judgments, except in Switzerland or Austria, are not enforceable in Liechtenstein.  Private plaintiffs will waste their time seeking local assistance in attaching assets.
       Liechtenstein Entity Forms
       The Anstalt
The Anstalt or "Establishment" is a corporation which is more accurately characterized as a international holding corporation.  Typically financial or controlling interests in foreign corporations and other entities are left in the care of an Anstalt and thus in the jurisdiction of Liechtenstein.  In many ways Anstalts function much the way that conventional trusts do.  An Anstalt can be founded with only one "founder" or "promoter" who is typically an agent local to Liechtenstein acting for an anonymous owner.  The local agent holds the charter of ownership on the Anstalt, which is the only record of the actual beneficiary of the entity, and can be made a bearer document.  Owners of Anstalts enjoy advantages such as: Thirty year tax rate freezes, no mandated debt-equity ratio, liability limited to assets, and extremely low taxation.  Some 70,000 Anstalts exist, though the precise number is a closely held secret (to avoid any attempt at process of elimination guesswork).  There is a one time fee to establish an Anstalt, generally SwFr 1,000 or 3% of the starting capital, and a yearly tax on net assets of the greater of 0.1% or SwFr 1,000.  Dividends are taxed at 4%.  A minimum capital requirement of SwFr 30,000 exists for Anstalts, but can typically be waived.  Taxation is more complicated for commercial entities in Liechtenstein, and auditing requirements apply, but generally taxation falls within 6 to 18%.  There are no reporting requirements for Anstalts which do not themselves conduct commercial activities.
Some problems with the Anstalt still remain.  Anstalts, like Panamanian corporations, are generally bearer certificate owned and easily transferable as a result.  Because of this, and the fact that most Anstalts are single owner entities, asset disputes can result if the bearer document falls into the wrong hands.
       The Treuunternehmen
Treuunternehmens or "Trust Enterprises" are modeled after the Massachusetts trust and are generally unlimited as to its structure.  Offshore activities, while better left to other jurisdictions in general, can be best effected through Treuunternehmens.         The Stifung
For the wealthiest clients, the security of Liechtenstein's foundations (Stifungs) are unparalleled, even in the offshore world.  While establishing a Stifung requires a due diligence finding by the trustee or founding attorney of the client's general good character, the disposition of the funds applied after the founding of a Stifung will be unscrutinized.  Stifungs require a separate offshore holding company for administration, have a board of directors, and a trustee/attorney.  The beneficiary is known only to the directors, and the attorney.  Like Anstalts and Treuunternehmens, Stifungs offer limited liability.  Stifungs can be best described as autonomous funds without corporate structures.
Stifungs too have some cautionary notes attached.  The director of a Stifung may take a narrower view of the distributions of assets than the original founder originally intended.  As directors are usually singular in Liechtenstein Stifungs, there is no recourse to disgruntled beneficiaries.  Of course, these problems are easily solved if a close and trusted person can be appointed as the founder.  Many trustees suggest the original founder's successor be appointed automatically on the death of the former.  Additionally, paying out on the entire net worth of the Stifung tends to assure the correct ownership attribution.
All of these entities are perfect for the asset concealer who wishes to stand before a local court and deny ownership of additional assets.  In addition to being technically true of the beneficiary of an Anstalt or Stifung, it has the additional advantage of being entirely uncontradictable.  Anstalts can be in bearer form, and Stifung founders are typically trustees.  A measure of the frustration of U.S. regulatory and prosecuting authorities in tracing the owners of Anstalts can be seen in the slew of U.S. proceedings with similar case names.  e.g., SEC v. Certain Unknown Purchasers, No. 81-Civ-6553 (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 1983)
       The Aktiengesellschaft
Aktiengesellschafts, "Share Companies," or "Stock Corporations" are primarily Anstalts for larger number of beneficiaries, and provide more complicated vehicles for share distributions and stricter internal board requirements.  They also have an initial capital requirement of SwFr 50,000.  Bearer or registered shares are permitted.  Shares may be held by nominees.  Aktiengesellschafts are required to keep proper books, appoint qualified auditors, and submit balance sheets to Liechtenstein tax authorities.
While holding corporations are a simple matter to establish, less than savory investors will have difficulty with direct banking.  Liechtenstein has been conscious of her international reputation, and generally more fussy about her banking clients.  Those depositors with less than SwFr 250,000 will be unable to expect much personal attention even if bankers will generally not turn away small depositors.  Depositors with SwFr 1,000,000 or more can expect fuller service banking services including portfolio advice.  Depositors with SwFr 3,000,000 can expect completely individualized service, including discretionary management by multiple fund managers directed to the client's individual needs.  Forming individual financial institutions is extremely difficult.
       Secrecy
Generally, Liechtenstein enjoys much more potent secrecy than her neighbor Switzerland, but because this has been somewhat eroded by international money laundering agreements and exceptions for criminal enterprises, she is a better reinvestment and shell management vehicle than expatriating entity.
The SEC's own Mr. Haberman commented once on Anstalts, "We've traced stuff to Anstalts in the past and then couldn't get anywhere - where the money came from, who the beneficiaries were, nothing."  Indeed, even where the ownership of the Anstalt is "obvious," proving it in court without the charter documents or extensive showings of financial information is all but impossible.  The combination of a Liechtenstein Anstalt as an umbrella for offshore corporations in other jurisdictions and bank accounts in a separate, potent banking secrecy jurisdiction is thus an excellent concealing combination.
Criminal activities, particularly drug related, are likely to remove the veil of secrecy, but unlike Switzerland, Liechtenstein's bankers have not explicitly adopted the SBA's 1982 "due care" agreement.  Secrecy in regard to tax matters is as absolute as can be found worldwide.  Liechtenstein and her financial institutions will under no circumstances whatsoever render any assistance to tax authorities.  Assistance in criminal matters, even in light of the recent money laundering compact, is limited to those cases where the activity in question reflects badly on Liechtenstein as a financial center.  Criminal investigation assistance under the Legal Assistance Act expressly provides for natural and legal entity secrecy even in cooperation with foreign authorities unless the crime in question is also illegal in Liechtenstein.  Assistance in the case of criminal charges stemming solely from tax evasion or currency infringements and related offenses will be curtly denied.
The 1992 provisions criminalizing drug-trafficking (Betaaubungsmittelgesetz). provide for five year sentences for those acting to hinder the discovery or retention of assets related to illegal drug production, distribution, storage, etc.  1995 provisions adopting Europe's convention against money laundering expands the exceptions to banking secrecy to proceeds having their origin in any sort of criminal offense which is also illegal in Liechtenstein.
Lawyers and trustees have a right of silence in any administrative or judicial proceeding, and secrecy is expressly written into statutes in several places.
Liechtenstein is best used as a tax shield and post expatriation umbrella for asset reinvestment rather than initial expatriation.
For a detailed treatment of Liechtenstein Laws with regard to insider trading, See, Emmanuel Gaillard, Insider Trading: The Laws Of Europe, The United States And Japan, 1992.  For a critical look at Liechtenstein secrecy entities, See, Liechtenstein's Uncertain Foundations, Anatomy of a Tax Haven, UE Ramati, Hazlemore Ltd Tax Publications, Dublin.
     Why I Like (sort of) The Cayman Islands
While the Islands have attracted increased law enforcement attention of late, they remain very attractive as a base for offshore corporations.  Cayman typically implies no-direct taxation, is not a party to any tax treaties, and grants exceptionally secure assurances against future increased taxation.  Cayman has excellent telecommunications systems, offers direct dialing to offshore locations and remains on eastern standard time all year long.  Government fees are the greatest burden to the asset concealer.
The real hitch in the Caymans is the mutual legal assistance treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States.  The treaty provides for information sharing in those instances where crimes are mutually recognized.  This, of course, excludes tax related offenses if they are not connection with otherwise criminal activity.  Investigations into narcotics trafficking activates a more liberal agreement which gives the U.S. Attorney General direct access to otherwise confidential information regarding Cayman Islands account holders.
       Entities in the Caymans
Every Cayman company is required to keep a register of its directors, officers, mortgages, charges, and shareholders.  Exempted companies may keep their registers anywhere in the world, others must keep it locally.  Exempted companies are not required to disclose any of their shareholders publicly.
Cayman corporations are divided into three types.  Local companies, exempted companies, and nonresident companies.  Local companies are permitted to conduct business in the islands.  Exempted companies are the general vehicle used to conduct offshore business and while they may use a local office to do so, they may not themselves conduct local business.  Nonresident companies are less flexible than exempted companies, but are less expensive to form.
Companies can typically be formed in one to two days and the documents are fairly simple.  Nearly 2,500 new companies are formed every year in the Caymans, offering the asset concealer ample opportunity to be lost in the crowd.
Exempted companies are granted a 20 year stay on taxes of any kind.  Unlike non-resident companies, exempted companies can issue bearer shares, no par value shares, and need not include "Limited" or "Ltd." as part of their business name.
Directors of exempted companies must hold at least one meeting a year locally but alternate directors are permitted and often trust company stand-ins are used.  While exempted companies can have a single shareholder, nonresident companies must maintain 3 or face personal liability of the shareholders for company debts.  Exempted companies cannot invite Cayman citizens to hold shares or debentures, though unsolicited share and debenture purchases are permitted to them.
       Private Banking
Cayman is particularly useful, even given the criminal legal assistance treaties, in its ease of banking entity establishment.  More than 500 licensed banks exist on Grand Cayman, and several trust companies have been formed in the last decade.  Banks and trust companies must be licensed by the Governor and Executive Council.  Class A licenses permit local and offshore operation, and Class B licenses permit only offshore operation.  Multinational corporations, families, and even individuals with "clean" credentials have been able to obtain licenses for banks and trust companies in the Caymans without much difficulty.  Unrestricted Class B licenses have a capital requirement of about $500,000 with a 100% pay in requirement, though portions may be guaranteed.  It is possible, in some circumstances, to obtain a restricted Class B license with less capital.
Class A licenses cost $50,400 per year, while Class B licenses a mere $15,120.  Setting up an offshore bank in Cayman should be possible with $40,000 and $25,000 per year.  Quarterly financial statements are required and while annual financial statements must be audited, they need not be published.  Class B licenses are generally eligible for a 20 year guarantee against taxes.  Restricted Class B licenses are also available, but these can be hard to come by.  Restricted licenses limit the number of depositors, and the undertaking which the bank may involve itself with.  Usually a filing with the authorities is required.  As the cost of obtaining an unrestricted Class B license is essentially the same, it is not usually worth the extra effort to pursue a restricted license.  Cayman banks of all flavors can be owned by a single shareholder, and contracting with local banks to operate facilities and lend personal are both permitted.  Typically trust companies charge between $15,000 and $25,000 per year for such Government fees are the most plaguing obstacle to the asset concealer.  If prices continue to increase, it may be beneficial to seek other jurisdictions in which to conduct ones activities.  Despite expense, Cayman is still an excellent place to establish an offshore investment company, a bank or financial institution, captive insurance company, or offshore trust.
     Why I Like Vanuatu
The pacific island nation of Vanuatu was at one time a condominium administered by France and the UK.  Currently, Vanuatu, formerly called The New Hebrides, is a Republic with a multi-party democracy and regular elections.  Under the British, Vanuatu adopted many of the aspects that today make it an interesting asset concealing jurisdiction.  Vanuatu has a balanced budget, a balance of payment surplus, no or almost no public debt and low inflation.
The government has explicitly endorsed tax haven type policies and even the opposition parties seem uninterested in rocking the boat.  Australia, however, has tightened regulations on her citizens who transact with Vanuatu.  Australian citizens must now file a "taxation clearance certificate" with local authorities before conducting business with Vanuatu.  Taxation Administration Act, section 14C (Australia)  In practice, such certificates are virtually impossible to obtain.
The great advantage of Vanuatu is the saturation of tax-haven participants.  Local financial, legal and accounting services have been so successful and numerous, that a flurry of merger and acquisition activity has resulted in the consolidation of several entities.  The result has been increased stability in these areas.
There is no registration requirement for trusts in Vanuatu, so there is no official account of their number, though it can assumed to be large as several large trust companies, some captives of major worldwide trust companies or banks, work actively on the islands.  Offshore exempted (secret) companies number 650+.
       Bearer Shares
Exempted companies in Vanuatu are "secret" and disclosure of financial or ownership information is punishable by a fine of VT100,000 or imprisonment of up to 12 months.  (1VT=$0.009 at the time of this writing).  Companies Regulation 1971, section 416.  While non-exempt companies require public filings of ownership, in practice this is often circumvented by trust ownership and registration in the names of the nominees.
Warranted bearer shares can only be issued by non-exempt companies and must be fully paid in.  Companies Regulation 1971, sections 38(a), 93.
Perhaps most importantly there are no taxes what so ever on capital or corporate profits.  As a result there are no double taxation treaties, and hence no provisions for information sharing whatsoever.  The obscurity of Vanuatu makes this one of the most impenetrable offshore centers around.
Banking does not permit coded accounts, or accounts in pseudonyms, although practically there are few if any checks on identity for depositors.  Local trust companies make these restrictions effectively unimportant, as nominee services are readily available to assure more potent account secrecy.
New companies can be very quickly set up in Vanuatu.  Three working days turn around time can be expected if an application is filled out in detail and in advance.  While off the shelf companies are not "available," in practice abandoned, unwanted, unused, or idle companies can often be purchased from local vendors.
Corporate forms in Vanuatu follow the Cayman Islands and Bahamas models.  The result is an excellent offshore style legal framework.
Companies in Vanuatu may be limited by shares, by guarantee, or unlimited.  They may be private, (if the articles impose: self restricted transfer of shares, members number less than 50, and a prohibition on public subscription for shares or debentures), or public.  For the asset concealer, the private company is the most Exempted companies are not permitted to own shares in non-exempt companies, own interest in any local undertaking, allow public subscriptions to stock or debentures, or conduct any business with any non-exempt company.
Any local judicial proceedings involving exempted companies in Vanuatu will be held in camera, and public records of the proceedings will not be recorded.
Technically speaking, a Vanuatu corporation is required to have issued and paid two shares in the minimal amount of VT1/share.  No formal requirements as to shares is actually required and shares with no par value at all may be issued by unlimited companies.  Exempted companies need only have one director and a separate secretary.
       Private Banks
The real gem of Vanuatu, however, is the ease with which the asset concealer may create a banking company.
Financial institutions in Vanuatu must be licensed and must have a minimum paid in capital of VT12.5 million if the head office is in Vanuatu, and VT50 million otherwise.  There is an annual license fee of VT300,000.  Reserve fund and liquid asset minimum holdings are enforced, and banks or financial institutions may also be exempted if they conduct no local business except with related entities and exempted financial institutions and banks are not subject to many of the stricter regulations imposed on non-exempt entities.  Unlike almost any jurisdiction, financial institutions may be exempted.  This is a powerful tool for asset transfer, privacy and concealment.  Exempted banking entities are afforded a good deal of flexibility in their minimum capital requirements subject to the approval of the Registrar.  There are no reserve or equity ratios imposed on exempt banks.  Most interestingly, local trust companies are in the habit of providing all staff, local directors, attorneys, and required personal for exempted banks.  Some beneficial ownership and audit requirements are in force, but exempted financial institutions and banks can expect full confidentiality as a matter of course and lax enforcement.
Combined with the complete absence of currency controls, Vanuatu is nearly the perfect jurisdiction for those asset concealers interested in founding their own private financial institution.

That's Herr Reichsmarschall Unicorn to you.
I'd be happy to find other work.  High tax jurisdictions, welfare states, and overbearing jurisdiction are, however, unlikely to go away.
I also happen to be independently wealthy, and have been since far before I ever took up law.  All that stolen art from my Nazi associates you When my position is:  "Courts are likely to do this."  A cite is entirely appropriate.  I don't make public value judgements on the policies of the United States in the same way that I don't want the United States to impose it's view of "right" on Liechtenstein.
Don't, if you can at all help it, Mr. Bell, confuse recitation of current fact with philisophical support for a novel, or as the case may be, raving position.
Of course, I'm just a Nazi, so....
Which is why I provide more practical detours around the problems.
Readers will note that I do this without calling people Nazi's.
Abuse is in the eye of the beholder.  You are beginning to blur your useage of the word "abuse" as badly as you were complaining about the court's use of the word "malice."  But perhaps its just the national-socialist need for order in me that makes me say so.

Mr. Bell the ultimate authority of the U.S. Constitution.  Spare me.
For someone so concerned about Nazis, you sure like centralized power.  As long as everyone agrees with you, they can live.  Interesting.
(I also think its one of the most beautiful buildings in D.C.)
Yadda Yadda Yadda.
I didn't say he had to know anything about whether the data was encrypted or not.  I would point out that the data holder who is convinced I was spending good money to store random bits would probably not be the data holder I would pick to hold my data in the first place, but this is a tangent, as knowing if the data is encrypted is irrelevent.
But I'm sure my view is just a Nazified one.  In Bellville (Bellview?), I'm sure everyone pays money to store megabytes of random data.
See above.  Because you say the Fifth amendment is applicable doesn't make it so.  You are not the Supreme Court (thanks for small blessings and all that).  We aren't talking fantasy here, or might be, or would be, we are talking about is.  And the system you propose is problematic.
Well, all the more reason for you to REFUSE to pay your taxes, or to do so in a way which is completely undetectable.
Easier said than done.  If you want to use this system, be my guest.
Saying the Gestapo is a bad thing doesn't make it magically go away.
Funny, the latest primary has been one of the highest voter turn outs in quite a while (except in Deleware).  Considering those are the law-and-order types who are most likely to invade personal liberities, I think its a bit hard to make the case that the temper of the country is anything but very pro-political process.
Actually, this usage of "voluntary" dates back something like 50 years.  The speed limit example, where states "voluntarily" adopt speed limits (or suffer a revocation of funds so serious so as to put them in receivership) is a classic example.  But as Mr. Bell is too busy looking for Nazis, he wasn't doing his homework and so missed this.
His bravado is a poor replacement for basic education.  It's not even very good bravado.
I've never made the case for anything but exactly this.  If I thought government behavior was reasonable, I'd not bother posting at all.  I just don't call people Nazis and call for murder for hire to solve the problem.  That's the resort of infantile mind.  The mind that fills gaps with ranting and violence where mental effort is too much of a task.
Again, this will be my last posting on yet another thread.  Mr. Bell has devolved again into ranting lunacy and that feedback loop that prevents him from confining himself to the merits of the debate.

Seems even Nazis know it better than he.
Considering by this time the encryped data would have been seized as evidence, I doubt this makes much difference.
Hey, call me a Nazi.
The data holder is ordered to turn over the data.  He does in this scenerio, the data is encrypted, LEO goes to the principal, principal refuses to provide key for the encrypted key that the escrow agent was holding, compelled discovery is ordered, now your right back into the case where the principal never gave the data to the escrow agent in the first place.
In short, useless expense.

Respect maybe, but care?  Please.
I disagree.  Law enforcement is only required to the extent the individual
is unable to protect him or herself from "predators."
Assuming that a certain level of economic development makes this
impossible or difficult is, in my view, a long jump.
What you fail to recognize is that the individual is much more empowered
on the internet than in other communities.  Looking at the internet as a
community is a misnomer.  It is a community only to the extent people
engage themselves in it.
You have to live somewhere on the planet.  You can't simply unplug from
the real world.  Participation in a community is mandatory in the real
world.  Not so with 'cyberspace.'
Louis Freeh for one.  Bill Clinton as another.  Senator Exon as a third.
Shall I go on?
My point is that I believe you are incorrect.
Mostly because many of us don't believe it's true.  While I will agree
that one sees similarities between socializations on the internet and the
real world, making the leap to a "mirror image" is pushing it.
Show me a good law that doesn't reduce freedom.  Give me one example
Your failure to connect privacy with individual security does not commend
your argument to the reader.
Since when has community security required censorship?  What you are
proposing are content based restrictions justified by the 'need' for
'community security' where the definition of 'community' is so vague as to
be meaningless and the meaning for 'security' is entirely undefined.
One might as well say:  We have to protect the hummahrmm from the hurmmms
in your message.  We're going to pass some laws to do it.
Well, that depends, again, on what your community is defined as, what you
mean by improve, the assumption that child pornography is detremental to
the community, the assumption that child pornography is a crime and the
assumption that law enforcement is really interested in reducing crime.
Uh... so?
If I pass a law forbidding nudity at all, including in private, as
showering increases the law is by definition broken more and more and so
the community becomes less free than before.  Now, this is the fault of
the showerers, isn't it?
This is basically what you say here:
This is classic left-speak.  It's not the government that has taken away
rights by passing laws that take away rights, but it's the fault of the
criminals (who are ill,mal, or undefined).  Blame _them_ for your loss of
Uh huh.
This is poor rationalization and after the fact justification.
You disprove your own point.  You just struck a blow to 'criminal' mail
forgers without the help of law enforcement at all.  In fact it is despite
attempts to prevent you from using strong cryptography by legislators and
the executive that you can accomplish this.  Can you also see that your
'community' is improved by the presence of this technology which deters
criminal mail forgers?  And, imagine that, it was done without the
expenditure of tax dollars.
Or do I have to spell this out for you?
It does, however, typically mean that at least one of them is wrong.

pornography distasteful in a vague and general way, but I am otherwise

This pattern that Mr. Hatcher is showing, demonize an act then show shock
when no one else responds to the propaganda; followup by demonizing those
not shocked by the demonized act, is a fairly classic tactic.  See
e.g., Atwood, Orwell, Cambodia.
But Mr. Metzger, that requires _effort_ and decision making.  We must save
the people from _effort_ and decision making because only _we_ the elite, know what is good for them.
You mean telling other people the only way to solve their problems as if
they are unable to do so themselves, or as if other solutions having
nothing to do with yours do not exist.
By the way, who said we want to call ourselves an emerging 'community' ?
Readers will note a familiar tactic.  "Parade of horrors."  The advocate
will pass a series of examples intended to shock and frighten the reader
into accepting the next convenient solution to these problems, which is
coincidently provided by the advocate.

Not at all.  (Did you mean sarcastic?)  His staff are some of the most

the statist side disturbs me, but I wasn't talking about their politics.
On the hill a competent and fairly reasonable enemy is much less a problem
than an incompetent publicity seeker.
I remember, I was sitting at the hearings.
One should bear in mind that it was Specter who pushed for hearings
originally, and Specter who was giving with one hand and taking with the
other all through the process.  I won't say I'm happy with Leahy for the
legislation, but that doesn't change the fact that he has a clue.  In my
view the legislation would have been much worse and Clipper more imposing
had Leahy not been involved.
Mind you, I never said Leahy was a giant in the movement for crypto and
privacy interests, just that I was glad someone had a clue.
Again, I never called him a friend, but I still submit to you, that his
influence in the legislative process blunted some of the highly offensive
positions.  Sometimes you have to expect legislators to make compromises.
It's a fact of the "democratic process" that Mr. Loomis is so very fond
of.  The result is that to gain influence over a given area of legislative
intent and effort, you sometimes have to sleep with whores (and

Accounting costs as a result of income taxation do not bother me.
Accounting costs as a result of a deduction based, multi-tiered,
progressive, and supplimented system of income taxation are silly.  The
income tax system in the United States has been driven since the post war
period by the effort to implement policy through the congress' power to
tax rather then the simple need for funds.  Allowing special interest
groups to drive a system of taxation is hardly fitting the goal of
"minimizing these costs."  The income tax system in the United States thus

Actually, I disagree with Mr. Sandfort on this one.
Taxation of International Income is a tremendously complicated field.
(You can get an LL.M. in international taxation alone for example).
While many on the list may be clever enough to find the resources to
properly structure businesses such to limit their tax exposure, the real
need is to research tax law, not tax technique.  This is a dynamic and
ever changing field and I cannot condone going it alone.  Tax consultants
charge $150 an hour (though I would be surprised to find an international
tax consultant worth his or her salt who was this cheap) because they can.
I've been doing international issues for years and I still get surprised
occasionally.  So do experts who have been doing it for decades.
If your simply looking to pick a jurisdiction, that's not so hard.
Neither is simply using a tax haven in simple ways or concealing skimmed
or cash assets.  Actually structuring an internatinal business endeavor is
a whole different ball game.
Are you looking to avoid or evade taxes?  Are you willing to relocate?
Renounce your U.S. (?) citizenship?  Can you do your consulting from an
offshore office?  Will you be in the United States for more than 182 days
a year?
I could go on for pages with questions like these that will significantly
change the solutions for you.

I could also easily bill you $5000 for basic and rudimentary consultation.

Creditors with the means to go looking can find a great deal even in
"banking secrecy jurisdictions."  I tend not to trust the Cayman Islands,
but that's more my paranoia and "sixth sense" then anything else.  Take
that concern with appropriate grains of salt.
I've not been pleased with Switzerland lately.
Liechtenstein is wonderful if you have a good deal of cash, but it can be
less interesting for smaller depositors.  I suggest Verwaltungs und
Privat Bank AG (VP Bank Liechtestein) for smaller depositors, and Bank in
Liechtenstein (BIL) for larger depositors.  (Disclaimer: I hold interests
in both these institutions).
Isle of Man has become somewhat less interesting to me because of the UK's
willingness to participate in mutual assistance treaties with the United
States.  Still, for banking and asset protection from private plaintiffs,
it's secrecy is good.
Other jurisdictions I would suggest simply for banking secrecy from
private plaintiffs would include Vanautu (Though I would note that there
is a bit of instability there currently.  It seems the locals dislike the
english governor a great deal and have begun to sound meanacing about it).
While Vanautu has passed a money laundering law, if your application is
not otherwise criminal it's still an excellent option.
For Corporations I would suggest jurisdictions that permit bearer stock to
be issued.  Panama (yes, still), Vanautu, Isle of Man, Cayman Islands.  I
can give a more specific list for people who are serious about their
interest.  Many of the British protectorates are very attractive.
Living?  Again, application specific.  Do you sail?  Ski?
It's important to recognize that general advice which does not tune itself
to your specific needs can be worse than useless.
Ignore almost everything I said above if your expected threat model is
anything more than low to moderately determined private plaintiffs
(divorce, personal injury, typical small to medium business law suits are
all fairly harmless with mere secret banking, but determined attackers
with more resources and government attackers have a great deal more

Incorrect.  There are many options for after-tax funds (including
investing in offshore corporations with active business income derived
elsewhere, offshore mutual funds, offshore funds in general, and the
advantage of extremely high interest rates in some jurisdictions).
The real trick is to structure things to take advantage of pre-tax funds.
This is complex, but certainly possible.  Did you know, for example, that
foreign tax credits can offset U.S. source income and can be carried back two and forward 5 years?
Incorrect.  There are many legitimate applications for placing funds
offshore that permit an individual to reduce his taxes legally.
False.  Avoiding tax is as legal as the constitution.  You mean evading
tax by failing to file truthful returns or otherwise concealing income.

The issue at hand was legal and non-tax evasion type advantages.  If by
"bad-boys" you mean private plaintiff's, then your position might apply to
the question at hand.  If, on the otherhand, it refers to the IRS or
government types, it won't.
The IRS may or may not know what's in the tax legislation books, or the
code or the regulations which the treasury itself submits.  This is not
the point.  The point, in legal tax avoidance cases, (as distinguished
from illegal ones) is that _you the taxpayer_ know, and can defend your
actions during process.
Again, the author was not asking for tax evasion advice, but tax avoidance
In any event, I'm not talking about technicalities or "magic pieces of
paper," but rather utilizing the loopholes that are built into the tax
process to your advantage.  There are small loopholes in which you might
get your head stuck, and larger ones that pose little or no risk, and
still larger and intended policy oriented ones which are literally
sanctioned by the authorities.  Many of these are as available to the
small taxpayer as to a MNE.

[Much about Mr. May's taxes and methods of filing as well as

You don't have to disagree with me here.  I've said this all along.  It
can be expensive and difficult to set up a system to reduce tax offshore.
But the expense is mostly in setup costs and very front ended.  Once a
structure is in place, it's not that hard to continue to benefit.
I have to strongly disagree here.  But now you're talking about evasion,
not avoidance.  It's trivial to hide stock ownership from the IRS.  This
is perhaps one of the easiest things one can do.  Consulting fees?  These
too can be concealed.  It takes more work, but its possible.
Were you to liquidate and move out of the country and renounce
citizenship, and consult from abroad, and if you did this properly with
your t's crossed, you could very easily and legally avoid (not evade) U.S.
tax.  The question is whether this is an option for you or not for other
practical reasons.
The IRS almost never settles like this.  Not in my experience anyhow,
unless they have a feeling that an aggressive auditor was over zealous
with your returns (and this should have been caught before you get to the
settlement phase in any event).
You're a skeptic, but a reasonable skeptic.
You have an idea about what you're willing to spend, and what your willing
to "pay."  Your decision seems to be (quite logically) based on those
I'll not claim its easy, and I know too little about your financial
situation to make specific recommendations.  (This is not, by the way, an
invitation for discloseure of anyone's financial dealings).  I
will say it's possible, and your mileage will depend on several factors.
How much you're willing to spend.  What you're willing to risk.  How risky
you want to get. etc. etc.  The nature of some people's business
makes it costly, others, who have mostly passive income, have an
easier time of it.
Here I'm not so sure I agree.  Several of us are working on making it
happen, soon.
Expatriate, have your expatriation pass the "Furstenburg" test and be
certified as being made for non-tax avoidance reasons, and you will pay
$0.00 in capital gains when you liquidate.
Should you be unable to pass the "Furstenburg" test, you can still enjoy
your dividens for 10 years before liquidating tax free.
If you don't want to wait 10 years, you can do a installment sale of your
stock via an exchange mechanism, tax free.
All 100% legal, until the Clinton "Death on expatriation" tax reform bill
passes and is signed.
I don't know what Mr. Sandfort suggested exactly, but I suspect he was
talking about an exchange of stock for debt instruments.  In some cases
such an exchange can be a non-realization event.  A form of this is one
way IPO execs still get cash from their options without being able to
exercise them and thus avoid the time restrictions on sale of stock and
condequently, often the realization of such sale.  I have to brush up on
my U.S. tax to tell you exactly when this works.  Let me know if anyone is

Is it easy to minimize taxation?  No.  The United States has intentionally
made it so.  Is it impossible?  No.  Never will be.
Part of the problem is inertia.  There is a (not unreasonable) view that
taxes to the extent that the U.S. imposes them are a fact of life and that
no efforts can mitigate them which will not cost more to implement than
will be saved.  The truth of this view varies in degree with each

(f) Adjustments in Tax Tables so that Inflation Will Not Result in Tax
(1) In General.- Not later than December 15 of 1993, and each subsequent
calender year, the Secretary shall prescribe tables which shall apply in
lieu of the tables contained in [the tables which define the tax brackets]
with respect to taxable years beginning in the succeeding calander year.
(2) Method of prescribing tables.-  [The tables] shall be prescribed-
(A) by increasing the minimum and maximum dollar amounts for each rate
bracket for which a tax is imposed under such table by the cost-of-living
adjustment for such calender year,
(B) by not changing the rate applicable to any rate bracket as adjusted
under subparagraph (A), and

to reflect the adjustments in the rate brackets.

you into the next tax bracket) is incorrect.
The bill took effect in 1993. (1992?)
Rates will not change with respect to inflation (to the extent that
inflation is accurately measured by the CPI).

It does.  My apologies.
Any increse less than $50 in the bracket rates is rounded down to the next
multiple of $50 under Section 1(f)(6)(A).
I do also recall a threshold statement of some sort, but I always thought
it refered to the $50 rounding exception.
Agreed.  And many states do not adjust taxation brackets for inflation.
My 1994-1995 code indicates 39.6% for single heads of households with
incomes over $250,000.  (Pay $77,299, plus 39.6% of the excess over
$250,000).  That was for the 1994 tax year.
If there was an explicit raise, I haven't heard (though this isn't too
surprising, I haven't paid much attention to domestic U.S. tax rates
There is a phaseout of personal exemptions and deductions for the highest
bracket which can effectively bring the tax rate above 40%.  Is this what
you mean?  (Or have I been sleeping through the tax legislation process?)
Agreed.  As per other forces, I can't see any given the Forbes fall and
the lack of interest in a flat reform measure.
I do, however, predict that compliance will begin to fall much more
dramatically following any explicit raise above 40%.

@_subject: MLM and Web of Trust 
[Excellent background deleted]
[Trust is not transitive.]
[PGP avoids transitive trust because of this problem and others]
Ok, so if the problem is with transitive trust and not the technical issue
of security of signatures, why not a hybrid of the vertical and web
PGP's primary problem in my view is that signatures are not flexible
enough, or they are too flexible.  A signauture can mean anything.  When I
sign a document signed by Bob, does that mean that I am vouching for Bob
as the author of this document, or that I agree with the document, or that
I certify that the document (regardless of my belief in its points) merely
passed by my desk on this date?
Similarly, when I sign a key.  Am I of the opinion that the "real name"
associated with this person is the only person in possession of the key,
of the opinion that this person is indeed (insert real name here) or am I
siging off on the e-mail address?
It seems to me that two things need to happen to improve the web of trust.
First, signatures have to be application specific.  Sure you can put the
words "This signature means that I believe XYZPDQ etc." at the bottom of
that which you are signing, but this method both lacks any kind of
standardization and further requires some sophisticated logical thinking
and a lot of planing by the average user.
I'd much rather see signature applications integrated in the software in a
simple way.
PGP currently asks:
READ CAREFULLY:  Based on your own direct first-hand knowledge, are
you absolutely certain that you are prepared to solemnly certify that
the above public key actually belongs to the user specified by the
above user ID (y/N)?
Why should PGP not also ask:
READ CAREFULLY:  Based on your own direct first-hand knowledge, are
you absolutely certain that you are prepared to solemnly certify that
the above document is accurate in all respects (y/N)?
READ CAREFULLY:  Based on your own direct first-hand knowledge, are
you absolutely certain that you are prepared to solemnly certify that
the above user is a careful and competent individual with the skill and
means to secure his secret key (y/N)?
READ CAREFULLY:  Based on your own direct first-hand knowledge, are
you absolutely certain that you are prepared to solemnly certify documents
signed by the above key are from the internet address associated with it
READ CAREFULLY:  Based on your own direct first-hand knowledge, are
you absolutely certain that you are prepared to solemnly certify that
the above financial transaction corresponds to your exact wishes (y/N)?
READ CAREFULLY:  Based on your own direct first-hand knowledge, are
you absolutely certain that you are prepared to solemnly certify that
the above user is not only a trusted introducer, but is fit in your
estimation to gague the security and signing skills of other users and
vouch for their fitness as trusted introducers  (y/N)?
It seems to me that integrating these issues, having a developer think
them out ahead of time for the user would be a valuable thing.  This
solves, to some degree, Mr Finney's "AOL" problem. (Wherein he expresses
concern over the differing skills of internet users and the ways these
difference complicate the web of trust).
Part of having an effective web of trust is defining exactly what a
certification means.  I don't think the web of trust fails because it is
non-vertical, but because it fails to define what certificates mean.  It
_imposes_ (or at least suggests) horizontal decision or treatment of a
certificate when it may be prudent for novice or moderately skilled users
to treat them vertically.  Yet to simply switch to a vertical scheme will
frustrate expert users who wish to maintain the flexibility of a
horizontal one for whatever reason.  (They don't trust institutions,
prefer to have more stringent or otherwise non-standard certification
policies, etc.)
Using certification that allows either (but perhaps defaults to vertical)
can easily be envisaged.
Software could be configued to trust only a institutional certifier to
designate trusted introducers as a default, (Perhaps an online security
mutiple test would be a good way for such an institution to make the
determination?) and yet users who wanted other schemes could select the
more expert options and designate their own introducers and introducer
READ CAREFULLY:  Do you trust the above user to (enter all that apply):
A) Introduce other keys for the purposes of secure communications and
document certification with those keys?
B) Vouch for the security consciousness of other users?
C) Vouch for the fitness of other users to certify introducers for your
web of trust?
D) Vouch for the financial fitness of other users?
Really it's no more than an extension of the "trust bit" that is already
in PGP signatures to other areas.
In addition I think it's important to extend this kind of flexibility to
all manner of signing activites.
I revoked a key some time ago because it was getting old and because 2048
bit keys were made available.  That revocation certificate could mean
anything.  It could mean I KNOW it was compromised, it could mean I
suspected it was, it could mean I found my secring.pgp file on a multiuser
system where I did not myself put it, it could mean I left a disk with my
secring.pgp on it in a library, or it could mean the key expired.
How are you to know unless I write up a complicated statement and sign it
and take pains to publish it all over creation?
Why doesn't PGP simply ask:
Are you:
A) Certain this key is compromised?
B) Of the view that it is probably compromised?
C) Worried it might be compromised?
D) Revoking this key because it is expired?
E) Issuing a general/non-specific revocation?
Again, standardized, easy for the user to understand, easy to distribute,
and very clarifying.
Someone could easily write a module which defined and updated these
differing trust issues for PGP and users could pick the codes they
prefered.  (A trust model flash rom?)
fincer - Certification with respect to financial integrity
ident1 - Certification with respect to true name identity
ident2 - Certification with respect to accuracy of e-mail account
secrt2 - Certification with respect to the users ability to keep a secret.
Don't force clever and sophisticated users to bow to a vertical system
when they don't have/want to.

When a client wishes to make anonymous restitution.  Baird v. Koerner, 279
F.2d 623 (9th Cir. 1960) (Wherein attorney was retained to organize
anonymous payment of delinquent taxes and IRS demmanded identification of
clients by attorney).
The so called "missing link" exception, where where disclosure of the
identity of client, in conjunction with already available information,
would have the effective result of disclosing a privileged communication
or violating the privilege against self incrimination.  In re Grand Jury

(2nd Cir. 1944) (Holding that client's identity was not so protected,
but which may or may not still be good law); See Generally, Cleary et al,
McCormick on Evidence (3rd edition 1984).
Generally speaking, if the attorney believes or should reasonably know
that the item was stolen, privilege will not apply.
First question, I can think of few attornies who would actually advise a
client to destroy something that might even one day possibly be evidence.
Well, let me rephrase that.  I can think of few attornies who would
actually advise a client to destroy something that might even one day
possibly be evidence if they thought they might be caught.
Second question, If the court thinks it was a crime and evidence was
destroyed it doesn't much matter what the attorney thought at the time.
I'll have to check, but this is probably a "reasonably forseeable"

Uh, so the whole of this plan relies on.
1)  The secrecy of the company.
2)  The secrecy of every 'employee' in the country
3)  Mr. May's ability to conceal his domestic spending.
Do you understand how naive this sounds?  Do you understand the extent to
which you are over simplifying the situation?
The plot thickens.
Do you know that there is imposed on U.S. citizens (corporations included)
a withholding tax for payments to foreign entities subject to U.S.
In this case the people paying the offshore company for Mr. May's services
are also subject to reporting requirements and a 30% withholding tax for
which they will be held liable.
This adds the requirement that the individuals or corporations receiving
Mr. May's service be involved in this conspiracy.  If they could have
been, why do you need the offshore connection?  Why not just conspire with
them to pay Mr. May in cash and not report it?
Continue your participation in such a plan.  I will send you cigs.

Except see footnote 1.
Footnote 1:
Looks like someone paying offshore for Mr. May to me.  Again, 30%
withholding requirement unless you intend to hide it.  The only way to
avoid this is to conceal Mr. May's involvement.
I really suggest you read some U.S. tax code provisions.
Such a jurisdiction will have extensive information sharing provisions
with the United States.  If you're planning on secrecy, avoid jurisdictions with tax treaties.
Also note that payments to an account for which Mr. May is the beneficiary
can trigger realization in several circumstances.
In this case the offshore entity can easily be classified as a Foreign
Personal Holding Company.  The resulting assets will be taxed per Subpart
F income.  (i.e. without regard to their distribution).  If the offshore
entity is held by U.S. stockholders it is going to cause major problems.
If not it still has major problems.
What you fail to mention is that in the event Mr. May actually holds the
assets until his retirement, he will still have to deal with realization
and full taxation when he taps into the funds.  You also fail to mention
the reporting requirements for U.S. citizens holding offshore assets of
significant size.
Because this plan can't seem to decide if it is secret or not, it has
serious shortcomings.
The example given looked to take advantage of large numbers of fictitious
employees all participating in the endeavor.  This is foolish.
Even in your example above, secrecy is poorly thought out.  Either it is a
tax avoidance plan, or it is a tax evasion plan.  Which is it?
Practically speaking I think you have merely altered the plan to adjust
for my comments and are stuck between both fact scenerios now.
See above.  See also foreign personal holding company and passive income
Wherever Mr. May sends his money it is still subject to taxation in the
United States if Mr. May is a citizen.  Structuring the payments to an
offshore entity in an attempt to avoid taxation on those payments is an
attempt to get the IRS to honor form over substance.  Good luck.
Caveat emptor.  (What's the name of your firm by the way?  Or do you
prefer to keep it concealed?  I would think you'd advertize it here if
you had anything worth selling).
Your ilk, (other examples of which can be found in the back of The
Economist, and Soldier of Fortune), are a small step above "get rich
quick" types.  Off the shelf companies and trusts have their uses but
anyone proposing to sell a standard tax avoidance/evasion setup off the
shelf should trigger major alarm bells.

This all depends on your application.
If you're trying to avoid specific identification when you are already a
suspect of some crime or some such, you're in trouble.  Short of finding a
dead person with no print record himself and no prior history, you don't
have many options.
Using someone else's prints risks you acquiring their criminal record of
past present and future.
If, on the other hand, you are seeking to preemptively foil later computer
checks of your prints you are in luck.
Most fingerprint indexing schemes rely on specific features in prints
which are ranked and reduced to a checksum of sorts.  To foil a massive
nation wide computer search which may flag your prints, you have to be
sure that the checksum of the prints you submit and the actual checksum of
your real prints are two significantly different values.
Generally speaking fingerprint requirements that are not related
to national security issues permit you to submit a card with the signature
of a "law enforcement officer" who made the prints.  I assume that this is
the case with your situation.
In this event you can indeed do the prints yourself.  Simply use a foam
(not felt) ink pad to make the print impressions on the card.  Sign
whatever name you feel sounds official.  (The GPO prints out standard
cards for this exact purpose, I assume you have one already).
Before doing your own prints, go out and buy some superglue (gel is best)
and the finest sewing needle you can find.
Those places which are covered in superglue will repel the ink and leave a
blank spot when your finger is rolled across paper or the card.
By applying a very small amount of superglue to the high ranking features
of your fingerprints using the needle as a sort of paintbrush, you can
alter the computer checksum of your prints without attracting undue
attention to the visual appearance of the prints you submit.  Think of it
as the ability to erace certain features of your prints.  Obviously it is
important to know which features are significant to the indexing
system.  I'm not enough of an expert to know myself how to describe them
to you nor do I know for certain the most recent ranking systems of
This is a tedious process and causes hand cramps.  It is, however,
extremely effective when properly done.
Any national computer search trying to locate the identity of your
real prints will likely skip right by your earlier submitted and distorted
prints.  A visual inspection, however, is unlikely to be fooled.
Some others have given you the advice that you should simply "refuse to
submit" prints.  I disagree.  A distorted record, especially if you create
one pre-emptively, will be especially beneficial while a refusal will
simply attract attention.  I recognize that some of the people on the list
here are a bit more "in your face" about their politics, but it is, for
example, hard to practice law without a professional license.  All the
constitutional arguments in the world don't mean anything when it comes to
actually making a living without a required professional license.
I compare it to the ease with which one submits a fake social security
number rather than simply refuse to submit one at all.  A fake one wont
raise any eyebrows, refusal will.
"What do you have to hide anyhow? Eh?"
Best of luck.

Several states do not bother to print infants at birth.
Several hospitals do not bother to follow state guidelines in those states
which do so require.
It is one of the great advantages of the United States that no
standardized procedure for person identification exists.  Seals and
certificates vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  Cross the border to
a state and a hospital birth annoucement is enough for a drivers license,
cross again and 4 pieces and a note from mom isn't enough.

Not _technically_ perhaps.  But in most cases it's a
go-down-to-the-police-station-and-have-them-sign-the-card operation.  Who
is it that can tell a random signature from a police signature exactly?
Like I said, standard print cards are available at the GPO.
Or _theoretically_ done in the light of day by a tech.
Depends on what you are looking to do.  If your goal is to deter random
searching through a national database, mutilation will probably be very
effective.  If they have the prints of the murderer (you) and you're a
suspect, mutilation aside from actually removing the fingers isn't going
to do anything.
See above about tech end around.

On the other hand, if more subtle doctoring escapes your notice....
I disagree.  ID badges and signatures are identification surely, but the
manner and process by which fingerprints are collected and used is
certainly more intrusive.  There is no, for example, national database of
signatures or corporate ID cards.
Which is why clandestine methods are more effective.
Sure, the employer can fire you if they find you out, but they have to
find you out first.
This is why "in your face"ers like Mr. Bell and others tend to fail in
their efforts.  They take the wrecking ball approach rather than run
around the stone in the river.
I think the concept was that it should be done in a way so as to reduce
attention.  10 dead men's prints (provided none were fugitives) might be
an interesting way to go about it.  Certainly less obvious than smearing.
Seems to me that the issue here is not getting fired, but what the
collected identification information will be used for in future.  I
consider spoofing prints and other biometric type information legitimate
if the motive is to avoid later identification for purposes not related to
the employment for which identification was required.
All this "suck it up and get printed" talk has me somewhat disconcerted
with the list.  Have many here not consistantly indicated that privacy is
something that must be self assured?
Isn't this the list that is so paranoid about what might be done with
escrowed keys?  Who might bribe the keepers into releasing such
information?  What might it be used for?  What about corporations selling
information about employees?
How are fingerprints any easier?
One can thing of countless examples in history (carefully avoiding
Godwin's Law in the process) where once legitimate record keeping and
registration was perverted for illicit, even evil use.
I think that unless proper means are taken to safeguard information,
social security number, license plates, and fingerprint records included,
that the individual is perfectly within rights to take his or her own
safeguarding initiatives.
Where those methods are not intended to simply evade prosecution, but
rather to foil extreme recordkeeping, I believe them legitimate.

Note the key provisons, for gain, and when submitted to those entitled to
the number legally.
This is obvious.  Some thought has to go into generation, and you
correctly point out the key place to look here:
We weren't discussing the IRS specifically, but I will address them.
Consider the context I used the social security number example in, that
being something which was used for that which it was not originally
intended and in which most of the entities who do use them are not legally
entitled to demand them.
Social security numbers are used so frequently as identification because
each person is only supposed to have one, and no two people are to have
the same one.
The fact is that one can quite easily survive without ever even having a
social security number.  A friend of mine was a trust fund kid and never
held a job a day in his life.  He would file every year and leave the
taxpayer identification number blank.  He paid all his taxes on trust
income and personal investment income etc., but never bothered to fill in
the number.  The IRS took his checks quite happily and continues to send
him a bit of paper every year complaining that he hasn't given them one.
I believe it's been running like that for 20 years now.
Another individual I knew sent a completely made up number on his first
tax return and just stuck by it for life.  Every year he'd get two notices in the mail.
I gave him a buzz and he faxed me copies which I now reproduce for you.
Notice 1:
Dear Taxpayer:
Thank you for the information you gave us on June 22, 1975 (The
letter is dated 1992) about your name and social security number.
However, the information still doesn't agree with that give us by the

The Internal Revenue Service can't correct this problem for you.  Only the
Social Security Administration can issue social security numbers or
correct records relating to them.
Please contact the nearest Social Security Administration office.  Be sure
to take proof of your age and identity.  If you are foreign-born, you also
must give proof of U.S. citizenship or alien status.  If you are 18 years
of age or older and have never had a social security number, you must fill
out the application in person.
According to the law, any person who files a return must include an
identifying number on it.  A social security number is used for this
If you have questions about this letter, please write us at the above
address.  If you prefer, you may call the IRS telephone number listed in
your local directory.  An employee there may be able to help you, but this
office is most familiar with your case.
Notice 2:
Dear Taxpayer:
Our records indicate the Social Security number xxx-xx-xxxx (used in
filing your return) has also been used by another taxpayer.  Please verify
your social security number by sending a copy of your Social Security
If you do not have a Social Security card [go get one].
Thank you for your patience and cooperation.
According to him he now has a total of 24 such notices, all nearly exactly
alike.  Funny, he keeps getting refunds though.
Given the above, I'm not too concerned for my friends.
Looks cost effective to me.  Costs about what it does to feed you long
enough to throw the junk mail away.
Again, this is all beyond the original point.  Even conceeding for a
moment that the IRS and your bank may be entitled to your social security
number 'by law.'  Your school, your library, your favorate shop, your
local radio shack are not.  If they ask for it, which they often do, make
something up.  Don't be fooled by morons who tell you about the 50
million different people who you are required to surrender your SSN to on
demand either.  IRS and those entities which must report to the IRS are
about the only universally recognized groups which can exert any authority
in demanding your SSN.  Some states have provisions requiring it for
driver's licenses, others don't care.
The question is not who is entitled to it now, but who is going to get it
later and what can you do about it?

The entire organization would clearly have to be double blinded.  If this

If payment is made weekly, it should be made in advance to an escrow agent
who would issue a certificate that the payment for employee r2dd54 has

Agreed.  I never claimed this.
Again, it depends on the degree of "mutilation."  Distortion of major
features is fairly effective even against partial attempts which are
matched by computer.
Careful.  Even Central Intelligence Agency print requirements are for
criminal background check only.  They will run through FBI files and so
forth and keep the prints for their records, but they are rarely if ever
used as identification verification per se.
This is because not everyone in the world has fingerprint files floating
around.  If you are getting printed for the first time ever and you
distory or mutilate, there's nothing to compare to.  Further, if you just
distort, you're prints later might not match well when computer searches a
nationwide database (which excludes CIA employees in any event).
It's all about application.
To repeat, if you're looking to "estlablish" a false print index,
distortion is a good way to do it.
If you're looking to evade a search which has already narrowed you down
well, hack off some fingers.

Illinois doesn't much care.  Michigan had no requirement at all, some
hospitals did, some didn't bother to print infants at birth.  This was
usually to avoid baby switching and such and records were dumped later on.
Wisc. never much seemed to care until about 5 years ago when someone tried
to pass a law.  I don't think it ever passed, but I'm not sure.  There is
no standard consensus on this.

Again, the point is that states can't decide if they want the task of
printing and sorting and collecting and storing such records.  It's not
cheap.  Even if it were, some states just don't care.
If you're trying to tell me that few if any unsolved cases involving
"unmatched" prints were committed by people younger than 55-60, I think
you might reconsider.  That's what your "everyone since WWII" statement
implies.  If that is so, why does the FBI maintain thousands of active
"waiting for print-person link" records for unsolved cases?
Either 1. - Not everyone born is printed or 2. - Hospitals who print don't
bother to submit to state or federal agencies because they (a) are not
required to (b) don't much care.
The answer is actually (3) all of the above.
Again, even what the AMA says has little to do with state and individual
hospital practice.  Of the printing that goes on, most infant
identification is done for internal hospital records, and most involves
ONLY foot prints.

@_subject: Senator, your public key please? 
I was running around the hill all morning and I thought I would drop in on
Leahy to see what his key signing policies were.  I gave Leahy a buzz to
see if I could catch him in person but unfortunately it's a busy day on
the hill and he sent me off to Beryl Howell instead.
Ms. Howell is Senior Counsel for the minority staff of the Antitrust
Subcommittee and handles all of Leahy's encryption gofering.  I'd dealt
with her on a limited basis once before, and I got a good 10 minutes to
discuss some issues before she had to run off elsewhere.
The issues she brought up were interesting.
Firstly, Leahy wasn't advised to issue a public key, it was entirely his
idea.  No staff suggestion there.
Secondly, the Ethics Committee was very interested in the issue.  As of
now they have ruled that "exchanging" PGP signatures is an "exchange in
kind" and an ethics violation.  Ms. Howell expressed exasperation over
this lunacy, but put it much this way:  "No, you guys don't understand
what the issues are here, but I don't have 3 hours to explain it all to
you either."  Apparently the ethics committee is concerned that a
signature from Leahy's key will constitute some sort of endorsement and the
"you sign mine and I'll sign yours" looks like influence peddling.
Part of the problem was that several politically oriented groups
approached Leahy's office and descended like vultures on a carcass,
all of them wanting to certify his key.  No signing from Senator's keys for the time being.  She said the ethics
committee went so far as to prohibit them from soliciting signatures from
others as well.  Her conservative (and reasonable) interpretation was that
she couldn't hand over a fingerprint of the key for signing purposes.
As things stand now Ms. Howell intends to try and educate some of the key
Ethics members over the August break and have a decent signing policy
after the break itself.

A person has notice of a fact if he knows the fact, has reason to know it,
should know it, or has been given notification of it.  Restatement,
Second, Agency section 9.
The important issue here is what constitutes constructive or implied notice (the second example above).
Constructive notice exists where a party could have discovered a fact by
proper diligence and where the situation casts a duty on him to inquire
into the matter.
A person who has _actual_ notice of circumstances which would set of the
"alarm bells" of a prudent person has constructive notice of the issue
itself where a notice clause was available and easily referenced.
See F.P. Baugh, Inc. v. Little Lake Lumber Co., 297 F.2d 692, 696.
Also comes the question what notice is adequate?  Notice reasonably
calculated, in all circumstances, to apprise all interested parties of
actionm and opportunity to present their objections, says U.S. v San Juan
Lumber Co., 313 F.Supp. 703, 709.

purposes of waiving rights to hold the remailer operater harmless.  These

not responsible for theft).

such, a notice like you are talking about is not likely to be very
I find that making the user decrypt the message as acceptance of the mail
is clever, but what exactly does it accomplish?  The user can still have
his copyrights violated in the text, what does it matter that he did or
did not accept the mailing?
Let's call this the "hash policy."
I'd be interested to see what the ration of volume between mailers with a
hash policy and mailers without a hash policy would be.
Simply the perception that records are being kept could have a chilling
The user is in no position to verify how secure those records are, or that
they are indeed hashed at all.
While the same is true with regards to logging at all (hash or no) I think
the feeling that the existance of records somehow makes it more likely the
the remailer operator will (with resistance) cooperate with the
authorities is amplified.
Either you do or do not believe that a remailer operator is keeping
full and unhashed records.
If you KNOW that records are being kept, well, to the user, what's the
difference between this and the mailer logging all traffic fully and
putting the information in a "Secure" directory?
How precisely does hashing protect the user?

Nothing.  Perhaps block e-mail from the address the threat mail was sent
from after a certain number of legitimate complaints.
This, of course, depends on the threats/whatever being sent to the
remailer in question as a 'first in chain' mailer.
Ask the recipient if he or she wishes all encrypted mail addressed to his
or her key to be supressed.

One is trying to remove liability for a tort, the other is instructing
the purchaser on the conditions of use.
While a ski-lift ticket could be considered a "license" to use the
property, selling an actual intellectual property ITEM makes the limiting
terms of its purchase a bit easier for a court to stomach.  Telling a
licensee that if he gets hurt its too bad, and telling one that he cannot
call a function or copy the work are fairly distinct in this way.
In the practical world, the plaintiff who is trying to enforce a software
licensing agreement is much better off than a defendant trying to resist
liability for a tort.
It's a question of appearances which can get lost in the nuances of
definition and technicality.
That depends.  If there was reason to believe, for instance, that the
message might indeed be four-horseman type (as a plaintiff's attorney I
would jump all over any messages which came from "soandso at PLO.com" or
somesuch) then negligence becomes an issue regardless.  Perhaps the host
was the site from which other nastiness was mailed?  Anything that could
be shown to put the operator on effective, implied, or constructive notice
that something was amiss.
Remember, technical savvy judges are few and far between.  Technical savvy
juries are nearly non-entitites.  My concept of what is or is not
suspicious when it comes to such things is going to be much more
sophisticated than that of a judge or jury in most if not all cases.
This is an important point.
The truth of the matter is entirely pointless in the U.S. Judicial system.
The APPEARANCE of the matter is key.
'punks seem to forget this in all their discussion of what a court might
do because, simply put, they know more than 99% of the population about
the subject.
I would simply put a notice of where complaints can be directed to, and
publish a stated (and carefully worded) policy for addressing abuses.
This will go a LONG way to insulating remailer operators.
"Your honor, my client has made every effort to filter the legitimate
users of his system from the illegitimate.  He has a stated policy
regarding complaints and investigates them to the full extent of his
ability in every case in which a complaint is filed.  Even as this is so,
he can no more completely assure that harassing messages will never slip
through than can the U.S. post office protect every citizen from mail
Or some such.  If you can say this in court and back it up, you're in
better shape.

Really hard to get courts to pay attention to these.
Signing away the right to process is a thorny thing.
Remailers on the attack points (first in chain, last in chain) simply MUST
be disposable as tissue.  They must be run as anonymously as possible,
with as little connection to the ISP's assets as possible and immediately
disposable.  They must be easy to set up, runable without root and there
must be a much more efficent tracking mechanism.  (Mr. Levin has done a
terrific job, but even more needs to be done).
This wanton suing, as I think we all know, is an abuse of the copyright
protections and their intent.  The only way to really deal with it is make
remailers unassailable.  Doing that with tricky dick type legal arguments
will, in my view, eventually fail.
It only takes ONE operator to get a tiny ($2500-$10,000) fine or judgement
and that will be the end of most of the mailers.  Poof.
This we cannot allow.
I wouldn't go this far.  It is an excellent argument for picking juries
that are experts with regard to the subject at hand.
In my view trying to balance bias rather than eliminate it is much more
If harassing mail is the issue, I can see how this might help in terms of
image.  I don't think its a complete solution however.
Again, I think the attack points have to be protected.

@_subject: RICO - (Was: Group order for Secret Power) 
I've had a pair of requests for my RICO outline.  Though much of it is
geared to discuss remailers and the "prostitution car case" I'm reposting
If people are REALLY intrested in a more specific outline, I'll consider
pecking out another one.
Several people expressed interest in a small treatment of seizure law jurisprudence, and the Bennis case (seizure of an automobile used for soliciting prostitution was upheld even where one of the owners knew nothing about its use for a crime and which Mr. Bell has relied on fairly heavily in pointing out that the Supreme Court has its "head up its ass.")
I want to point out that I'm not being paid for this.  As a result anyone who takes this like legal advice, rather than what it is, i.e. an academic examination, does so at their own peril.
I cover RICO because it's a popular prosecution tool, because it is the predominate vehicle for seizure and forfeiture in federal cases (of which remailer and encryption issues are likely to arouse) and because it represents a codification of the approach most courts take when dealing with seizure cases.  In a very real way, RICO represents the outer extremes of seizure cases in the United States, and is probably, given the complexity of many state laws, the simplest way to "grab" something.  It also has civil provisions which make "private prosecutors" out of you and me.
Generally speaking, after its passage (1970) RICO was ignored.  (Interested readers might look to Bradley, Racketeers, Congress and the Courts: An Analysis of RICO, 65 Iowa Law Review, 837 (1980). for a detailed review of its early development).  It was "rediscovered" some years later, and grew in popularity because of the civil provisions for divestiture, dissolution, reorganization, and restrictions on future activites as well as treble damages under 18 U.S.C. 1964.
Generally speaking, in order to secure a conviction with RICO, one must prove the existance of an "enterprise" and a connected "pattern of racketeering activity."  RICO prosecutions are generally triggered by predicate acts, listed specifically in the statute.  The statute lists these in the definitions section.  (Section 1961)  I reproduce some below to give the reader a feel for what is anticipated:
As used in this chapter--
(1) "racketeering activity" means (A) any act or threat involving murder, kidnaping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, dealing in obscene matter, or dealing in a controlled substance or listed chemical (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substance Act), which is chargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year; (B) any act which is indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States Code: [bribery, sports bribery, counterfeiting, theft from interstate shipment, embezzlement from pension or welfare funds, extortionate credit transactions, mail fraud, transmission of gambling information, wire fraud, financial institution fraud, obscene matters, obstruction of justice, tampering with witnesses, informants or victims, money laundering, monetary transactions with respect to property derived from unlawful activity, sexual exploitation of children, white slavery, (some deleted)]  (18 U.S.C. 1961)
The activities specifically prohibited by RICO are also statuatorily defined.  Specifically:
(a) It shall be unlawful for any person who has received any income derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of racketeering activity... in which such person has participated as a principal within the meaning of section 2, title 18, United States Code, to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part of such income, or the proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any interest in, or the estlablishment or operation of, any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce....
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.
(c) It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of an unlawful debt.  (Section 1962)
(d) [or to conspire to do any of the above]
The seizure provisions are contained in 18 U.S.C., Section 1963:
(a) Whoever violates any provision of section 1962 of this chapter shall be [fined and imprisoned or both] and shall forfeit to the United States, irrespective of any provision of State Law--
(1) any interest the person has acquired or maintained in violation of section 1962;
(2) any --
(A) interest in;
(B) security of;
(C) claim against; or
(D) property or contractual right of any kind affording a source of influence over;
[the enterprise violating section 1962]; and
(3) any property constituting, or derived from, any proceeds which the person obtained, directly or indirectly, from racketeering activity or unlawful debt collection in violation of section 1962.
(b) Property subject to criminal forfeiture under this sections (1) real property, including things growing to, affixed to, and found in land; and
(2) tangible and intangible personal property, including rights, privileges, interests, claims and securities.
The lead case generally used to outline the overall principals of RICO is United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576 (1981).
Most of the defining litigation surrounding RICO involved refining the definitions of "enterprise" and "pattern" of racketeering.  Turkette indicates in part that:
Section 1962(c) makes it unlawful "for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt."  The term "enterprise" is defined as including "any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity."  (Turkette)
Of primary importance, and the key issue in Turkette, is the fact that "There is no restriction upon the associations embraced by the definition: an enterprise includes any union or group of individuals associated in fact." Id.
Both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises qualify.  United States v. Hartley, 678 F.2d 961 (11th Cir. 1982) applied RICO to an otherwise legitimate corporate defendant.  On the subject of passive involvement of a defendant in criminal activity the court in Haroco Inc. v. American Nat'l Bank & Trust Co. 747 F.2d 284 (7th Cir. 1984) ...the defendants are surely correct in saying that the corporation enterprise should not be liable when the corporation is itself the victim or target or merely the passive instrument for the wrongdoing of others... The liable person may be a corporation using the proceeds of a pattern of racketeering activity in its operations.  This approach... makes the corporation enterprise liable under RICO when the corporation is actually the direct or indirect beneficiary of the pattern of racketeering activity, but not when it is merely the victim, prize, or passive instrument of racketeering.  This result is in accord with the primary purpose of RICO, which, after all, is to reach those who ultimately profit from racketeering, not those who are victimized by it. (This preference for enterprise liability has been followed by other courts. See e.g., Schreiber Distributing Co. v. Serv-Well Furniture Co., 806 F.2d 1393 (9th Cir. 1986); Commonwealth of Pa. v. Derry Construction Co., 617 F.Supp 940 (W.D.PA 1985).  See generally, First, Business Crime, 1990)
And Ravens v. Ernst and Young, 113 S.Ct. 1163, refines the definition of "conduct or participate" thusly:
Once we understand the word "conduct" to require some degree of direction, and the word "participate" to require some part in that direction, the meaning of section 1962(c) comes into focus.  In order to "participate, directly or indirectly in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs," one must have some part in directing those affairs.  Of course, the word "participate" makes clear that RICO liability is not limited to those with primary responsibility for the enterprise's affairs, just as the phrase "directly or indirectly" makes clear that RICO liability is not limited to those with a formal position in the enterprise, [note 4] but some part in directing the enterprise's affairs is required.  The "operation or management" test expresses this requirement in a formulation that is easy to apply... In sum, we hold that "to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs," one must participate in the operation or management of the enterprise itself.
Let us assume for a moment then that the worst conspiracy one can imagine, involving all of the horsemen of the infopocalypse, uses a remailer to conduct its activities.  Absent a showing that the conspiracy is involved, participating, or directing the operation of the remailer, or that the conspiracy used proceeds to support the remailer, it is pretty clear that the remailer, and the operator are a "passive instrument" of the conspiracy.
One might also look to the Justice Department Guidelines for the use of RICO as a prosecutoral tool:
"...it is not the policy of the criminal Division to approve "imaginative" prosecutions under RICO which are far afield from the Congressional purpose of the RICO statute.... Further, it should be noted that only in exceptional circumstances will approval be granted when RICO is sought merely to serve some evidentiary purpose, rather than to attack the activity which Congress most directly addressed- the infiltration of organized crime into the nation's economy."  (9-
110.200, RICO guidelines preface).
One might also look at the second circuit in Huber:
"We further note that where the forfeiture [under RICO] threatens disproportionately to reach untainted property of the defendant... section 1963 permits the [court] a certain amount of discretion in avoiding draconian (and perhaps unconstitutional) applications of the forfeiture provision."
In sum, provided no statute exists expressly felonizing the operation of e-mail forwarding or encryption, I wouldn't much worry about RICO.  I might add that future legislation prohibiting "furtherance of a felony via encryption" or some such is almost certain to have a scienter requirement making innocent forwarders of such information who did not know they were furthering a felony immune from the statute, and thus RICO.
The Michigan Case, and why it has absolutely nothing to do with Mr. Bell has made a great to-do about the Bennis case (seizure of automobile absent showing that co-owner knew of criminal use of same).  His connection of the case to remailers and is surrounded by a good deal of imagination, myth, and outright fabrication.  I thought I would take a closer look and see what was to be found.  Let me then dispel some of the myths.
Myth   This holding means that any property can be seized for any crime and the owner placed at the mercy of the state at a whim.
Totally false.  The Michigan law is specifically written to allow property seizure in the specific instance of prostitution or gambling.  Many states have forfeiture laws, but they are an extreme resort, and typically bear only on very narrow activities.  Michigan, further, is at the draconian side of the spectrum.  Michigan also has some of the toughest state drug laws in the country (Automatic life sentence without parole for mere possession without intent to distribute, of more than 650 grams of cocaine)  Consider the Michigan law, reproduced below.
Section 600.3801 of Michigan's Compiled Laws. states in pertinent part: "Any building, vehicle, boat, aircraft, or place used for the purpose of lewdness, assignation or prostitution or gambling, or used by, or kept for the use of prostitutes or other disorderly persons... is declared a nuisance, ... and all... nuisances shall be enjoined and abated as provided in this act and as provided in the court rules.  Any person or his or her servant, agent, or employee who owns, leases, conducts, or maintains any building, vehicle, or place used for any of the purposes or acts set forth in this section is guilty of a nuisance."
Section 600.3825 states in pertinent part:
   "(1) Order of abatement. If the existence of the nuisance is established in an action as provided in this chapter, an order of abatement shall be entered as a part of the judgment in the case, which order shall direct the removal from the building or place of all furniture, fixtures and contents therein and shall direct the sale thereof in the manner provided for the sale of chattels under execution . . . .
"(2) Vehicles, sale. Any vehicle, boat, or aircraft found by the court to be a nuisance within the meaning of this chapter, is subject to the same order and judgment as any furniture, fixtures and contents as herein provided."  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. @ 600.3825 Myth  This means that if your property is seized, you can never make an innocent owner defense to the seizure.
Again, false.  Many statutes allow innocent owner defenses and some courts will assume the availability of such a defense in absence of express intent by the legislature to the contrary.  In this case there was such an expression.  Namely:
"Proof of knowledge of the existence of the nuisance on the part of the defendants or any of them, is not required." Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. @ 600.3815(2) (1987).
Myth  If your car is stolen, and it is used in the sales of drugs, its gone baby.
False.  Most states recognize that use of property without the owner's consent insulates the property from seizure.  Michigan is no exception.  Note the Supreme Court's Comment in the Bennis Case:
The Michigan Supreme Court specifically noted that, in its view, an owner's interest may not be abated when "a vehicle is used without the owner's consent." Id., at 742, n. 36, 527 N.W.2d at 495, n. 36.
Myth   This is a new and outlandish holding by the Supreme Court.  Nothing like this has ever been seen before.  It represents a turn to fascism.  The current Supreme Court has its head up its ass.
False.  The history of allowing seizure of property not taken without the owners consent, even if the specific use of the property was indeed without the owners knowledge goes back more than 150 years and can be traced to Britain's own practice (maintained to this day).  Take the Supreme Court's comment again in the Bennis Case:
Our earliest opinion to this effect is Justice Story's opinion for the Court in The Palmyra, 25 U.S. 1, 12 Wheat. 1, 6 L. Ed. 531 (1827). The Palmyra, which had been commissioned as a privateer by the King of Spain and had attacked a United States vessel, was captured  [*10]   by a United States war ship and brought into Charleston, South Carolina, for adjudication. Id., at 8. On the Government's appeal from the Circuit Court's acquittal of the vessel, it was contended by the owner that the vessel could not be forfeited until he was convicted for the privateering. The Court rejected this contention, explaining:
"The thing is here primarily considered as the offender, or rather the offense is attached primarily to the thing." Id., at 14.
Myth   This means that if someone drives my car to the city, and then blows up a building and flees via subway, my car is history.
False.  In order to allow seizure, the property seized must typically be an "instrumentality" of the crime.  Granted this is a bit of a obscure distinction at times, even to supreme court justices:
The limits on what property can be forfeited as a result of what wrongdoing--for example, what it means to "use" property in crime for purposes of forfeiture law--are not clear to me. See United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U.S., ___ (1993) (slip op., at 2-5) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). But it's fairly clear that this is a significant defense to seizure, and one which was never raised by the defense in Bennis:
It thus seems appropriate, where a [challenge] by an innocent owner is concerned, to apply those limits rather strictly, adhering to historical standards for determining whether specific property is an "instrumentality" of crime. Cf. J. W. Goldsmith, Jr.-Grant Co., supra, at 512 (describing more extreme hypothetical applications of a forfeiture law and reserving decision on the permissibility of such applications).The facts here, however, do not seem to me to be obviously distinguishable from those involved in Van Oster; and in any event, Mrs. Bennis has not asserted that the car was not an instrumentality of her husband's crime. (Bennis)
After getting the government's brief by fax this afternoon, it became fairly clear why the non-instrumentality defense was not made.
After John Bennis was seen stopping and allowing Ms. Polarchio to enter his car, the Police followed him to a residential area, midway in the block, where his car stopped and the lights were turned off. (TR-63-65) After the police stopped behind the Bennis' auto, two heads were seen: a female on the right, a male on the left. Seconds later, the female head went down, disappearing toward the drivers side. (TR 65-66)
When the officer observed John Bennis and Kathy Polarchio engaged in fellatio in the Bennis' car, John Bennis had his pants pulled down. (TR-67)  (Bennis: Brief for the Government)
It's pretty hard to argue that the automobile was not an instrumentality of the crime when it was used to pick up, transport and conceal the illicit sexual practices of the defendant.
Myth  The court just doesn't care about property rights.
False.  The court spends a great deal of time thinking about the parties rights, and even suggests a different ruling had the car not be co-owned by the perpetrator of the crime.
First, it bears emphasis that the car in question belonged to John Bennis as much as it did to Tina Bennis. At all times he had her consent to use the car, just as she had his. (Bennis)
It also considered what Mrs. Bennis would actually gain from a ruling in her favor from a practical standpoint:
Th[e] court declined to order a division of sale proceeds, as the trial judge took pains to explain, for two practical reasons: the Bennises have "another automobile," App. 25; and the age and value of the forfeited car (an 11-year-old Pontiac purchased by John and Tina Bennis for $ 600) left "practically nothing" to divide after subtraction of costs. See ante, at 3 (majority opinion) (citing App. While it is tempting to damn the decision after listening to the sound bytes, there is much more going on here than a mere seizure.
Remailer operators shouldn't be concerned (at least with regard to these cases) overmuch until a local state statute addressing remailers specifically is passed in a jurisdiction where the innocent owner defense is not permitted, or in any jurisdiction where such statute forbids resort to the innocent owner defense.  I will, however, note that this about 3 hours work, and I wouldn't go betting the farm on it.

@_subject: Law and Libel - Or why I use a nym. 
How ever you may find it, it is the method of choice in the United States
for resolving disputes.  As for my zeal to sue, whom have I sued?  I've
entered into a settlement for a copyright dispute with one list member,
who has since found other outlets for spouting non-sensical rants..
I find that people who are being unreasonable often stop when they realize
a cost might be attached.  It quickly ends the reign of the spoiled brat when daddy might have to hire an attorney.  If am I to be demonized for
using the system, so be it.  Until it is changed I too live in the real
world.  As for debating strategy, it has been long clear that no debating
strategy, effective or not, will have any impact on the typical, and
increasingly common, cypherpunks "Loon."
I dislike the legal system in the United States.  If it can, however, be
used to deter loons from spouting absolute nonsense where no other method
has been effective (I believe that both the recent crypto snake oil and
totally contentless rants of a specific poster are a good example) then so
be it.
I think many people fail to realize that the right to sue is in many ways
an entitlement.  It is allocated to those who government wishes to protect
and can be wielded because it is the government's wish that a certain
class of individual be so empowered.  In many cases, liberal trash about corporations being the only entities who can afford good legal help
aside, it is the only recourse for the average individual.
If the threat to sue is too powerful for your taste, write your
congressman.  It is a tool, no more no less than crypto.  It may not be
the nicest thing in the world to threaten to sue someone, but I have never
threatened anyone with legal recourse who was not given an opportunity to
correct their conduct first.  I've also not threatened anyone with legal
action when no viable case existed.
1> I don't do lobby work.
2> I don't believe that personal insults fall within the jursidiction of
government (nor should they).
Statements which, on the other hand, cause actual harm to the reputation
of an individual, and where said individual can substantiate that harm,
are, and in my view should be, actionable.  Take note, "Vlad" and
"Dimitri," you stray very close to this boundary.  I've noticed, despite
your bluster, that personal insults from you directed to a specific
cypherpunk have much ebbed since a legal fund began to emerge.
Look folks, you cant tell someone that the neighborhood doctor is on
herion and expect nothing to happen.
You can't tell consumers that your crypto product is absolutely secure
when it isn't and expect nothing to happen.
I submit, cypherpunks, that in this day and age of archived mailing lists
and instant key word searches, suits for defamation and slander will
become MORE important, not less.  Three years from today a prospective
customer of one of you might call up the Alta Vista page and find some
blather about you being on Lithium and decide to give his contract to Bill
instead.  Silly?  Perhaps to the list member who has the context of the
discussion from which to judge the statement.  Not necessarily to the
prospective client, who may not know any better.
Not everyone has been so prudent to protect themselves with a pseudonym
such as I have.  Unfortunate in my view.  I don't need to resort to the
legal system to protect my reputation.  This is by design.  This is as
cypherpunks would have it, or so I would hope.
Mr. May quite rightly points out that resort to the legal system is
somewhat inconsistent with the creed of cypherpunks (if such a thing
exists).  Technology should be used instead.  On this point you will get
no argument from me, I practice just this policy.  Unfortunately, last I
checked, there are perhaps 3 active nyms on the list (Does Pr0duct
Cypher even exist anymore?) and filtering is hardly as common as it should
be.  (At least, judging from the number of complaints about "Vlad" and his
Until the rest of you adopt nyms the legal system is all you've got.

@_subject: Secrecy: My life as a nym. (Was: nym blown?) 
I'm not sure which meeting this would be.  If I was on any published list
it would be under a pseudonym or a large and diverse enough list where I
didn't feel threatened by it being public.  Generally these are meetings I
attend only for personal or academic interest.  (i.e. I'm not attending in
an official capacity or participating in a way which would make my
presence obvious or a matter of record).
I suppose you could be referring to the ABA Committee on Law and National
Security Conference on Intelligence and Law Enforcement in September.
That's the most recent meeting I can recall which might fit your
If my attendence to that event was published by anyone other than myself I
am unaware of it.  Even if it were I doubt it would be of value in linking
me to a "true name."
But this brings up some interesting points, and, with your patience, I
think I will take this time to blather on.
Secrecy - A few words (or more).
Secrecy is all about vigilance.  If you never put your name on something,
your name is unlikely to come up.  I fail to understand why this is, it
would seem, such a difficult concept for some cypherpunks to grasp.  If
everyone treated true names like PGP passwords and added in a touch of
disinformation here and there where required, true names would be nearly
impossible to determine.  To my knowledge few have bothered on this list.
I find this unfortunate.  In my personal experience it is quite easy to
conceal one's identity, particularly so where personal and professional
circles differ significantly, as they do in my case.
I admit that I am advantaged in that I was born outside the United States
and come from a family jealous of its privacy to begin with, but I submit
that secrecy of the kind I have (it would seem) preserved is not that
difficult to estlablish, and maintain.
I originally adopted a nym because I was concerned that my public
statements on the list and elsewhere in cyberspace, (which have nothing
to do with my professional conduct, my ability to represent clients or
wear my fiducuary hat) might be taken out of context and prejudice clients
or shareholders in one fashion or another.  Cypherpunks, and my politics
generally, are not always conducive to the traditional conservative
dispositions my clients and my family often had.  I was tangentially
concerned about some pre-publication review issues, which have since
evaporated.  As time went on it became clear that a nym was useful in
other ways.
For one, because I chose a depiction "Black Unicorn," rather than a name
"John Smith," I found that those who eventually contacted me by e-mail had
first to overcome the "silliness" reaction.  Seems rather moronic to write
an adolescent sounding "handle" about financial advice and so forth.  A
pre-screener of sorts.  The inquries I received were from individuals
interested or driven enough to ignore the cartoonish pen name as a result.
A decided advantage in my view.
A disadvantage: When I adopted the nym, I had not planned it to last quite
so long.  The image was perhaps a bit too personal to deter close and
determined investigations from revealing my identity, or at least come
close. (As one cypherpunk- I think you know who you are, though I'm not
sure- did).
Secondly, the potential for malicious reputation destruction was reduced
dramatically.  Its hard to call my clients and anonymously reveal my
"heroin problem" or some such.  Given the heated flames I am alarmingly
prone to participate in, this was something of a comfort.  I don't think I
ever abused my secrecy to avoid accountability for any real nastiness on
my part, though perhaps the list would be a better judge of that.
Thirdly, it became clear that given the amount and degree of archiving
which developed on the net, I was protected from the notorious "sleeper
blooper" attack.  "Do you recognize this, a posting from 1897, in which
you said that abortion should be legalized?"  This affords nice protection
from the sudden change in conventional wisdom on all the topics I
discussed.  (The flip side is that if banking secrecy ever comes back in
vogue, I need only reveal myself by signing my key to something with my
name on it and take credit for being a maverick in my time, or whatever).
This is a point that bears exploration.  The ability to pull up a literal
rap sheet on a person is no longer confined to law enforcement (as
our KOTM profiler so aptly demonstrated only days ago).  It is now an
easy endeavor which private investigation services once charged $65.00/hr
or more to accomplish.  Your's for only the cost of a local call.
Yet at the same time few seem to have bothered to pursue research on my
nym.  I paid for early accounts in cash or with a cutout credit
card, eventually using a provider I had substantial control over instead.  I monitored things as simple as calls to my access provider, whois
commands (try whois.ripe.net), finger requests, etc.  To my surprise,
these were few in number.  I think people generally were uninterested, and
those who were either got bored or distracted.
Fourthly, the nym lent some protection from the baseless law suit.  No
longer is it in the power of just anyone to cost me time and money simply
because they wish to.  If I really engage in some conduct which causes
serious harm, and the potential for returns are high enough, resources
will doubtlessly be allocated to identify me and name me in a suit.  If
this cost is high enough, however, nuisance suits become hard to initiate
effectively.  An important point given all the discussion on the list
about the wisdom of legal threats for libel.
I think that the usual cypherpunk solution, if such a thing exists, would
be to use technical means to deter law suits, yet many in here resort to
attacks on those who would use the system instead.  Hasn't this been the
cypherpunk experience, that prosecutorial discression is no protection?
Why is libel any different?  Given that civil suits put the private party in the place of prosecutor, and that party has less of an incentive to
practice discression in initiating suit (no political checks, no
supervisory authoirty or chain of command) it would seem that civil suits bear a HIGHER risk of abuse.  Yet government, which like it or not has
several checks built in that the civil system does not, gets the most
attention in this regard.  A point to consider anyhow.
What were the biggest problems?  Family.
A pair of c'punks managed, by coincidence in one case, design in the
other, to collide with my sister on the net.  As she had a full and rather
open web page up and this had the potential to give out a plethora of
clues.  Nothing too personal, (thanks sis) but I was unaware the page
existed for quite awhile.  Again, I believe that it was a cultrual thing
which prevented her from spilling all her life's details and our family
name out onto the web like some kind of billboard.  (All it takes is a
quick look at something like "babes on the web" or whatever to find quite
well designed stalker's cliff notes happily authored by the stalkee.  One
page  I saw recently had a resume with social security number on it).
Cultural issues...
The problem with the United States is the complete integration of identity
publication into the development process.  Cub scout fingerprintings, year
book photographs, medical records, social security numbers at birth, the
list continues.  As numerous as these subtle and progressive degradations
of secrecy are, they are still not insurmountable for the United States
citizen.  No more than 4 or 5 absences on key dates would be required to
remove any individual from high school year books.  Complying with the
letter of the law, and no more, with regard to Social Security Number
disclosures is simple.  (Simply never write it down- or at least not
correctly- the people who need it, have it).  I have lived on and off in
the United States for quite some years, and I have never encountered a
situation where an actual social security number would have been required
of me.  I have shot myself in the foot by refusing to give on rather
than making one up, but this is a side issue.  Two associates of mine have
had similar experience. One (29) has no number at all and never bothered
to get one (last I heard, he was working in a high paying corporate type
job in a major city on the East Coast).  The other (38) has a number but
can no longer remember what it is.  (25+ years of disuse).  I assume that
whenever asked, they simply provide erronious or misleading information.
Both are U.S. citizens.
Unfortunately, in the United States most citizens only become interested
in privacy in their 20s or so.  By this time it is difficult to overcome
the mass of information which has been stored up.  (Pseudocide can be an
attractive option for some perhaps).
One marvels at the inability of Joe Sixpack to recognize the value of at
least a hint of caution with regard to identity.  (Especially so given all
the media hype about the dangers of social engineering, account number and
social security number publication and license plate information).
Given the cultural elements, I suppose it shouldn't be surprising to me
that any disclosure about a nym seems to bring with it a thousand clever
investigators who are sure that they have just managed to happen on a
"slip up."  (No less than four postings of this nature followed the DCSB
announcement).  For some reason, however, I still can't help but wonder
that secrecy seems so alien even to noted members of this list.  (Chrysler
kept its complete control over Norex N.A. a secret for 10 years, despite
the fact that millions flowed between the two companies regularly.  Crazy
Eddie, of New York fame, managed to keep his assets hidden, under the most
immense pressure, and his identity concealed for several years despite all
attempts by the United States to find him.  Saddam managed to avoid bombs
and cruise missles even in the face of satelite and directed intelligence
tasking.  Given these, keeping your name away from the Health Insurance
company should be quite obviously possible).
There are a few people out there who probably know who I am, but I'm not
sure that even they realize it exactly.  In terms of money I've not even
put much effort into it over the years, at least no more so than I do
protecting my personal privacy generally.  Part of the reason is that it
takes effort to research this kind of thing.  Even access to Lexis/Nexis
isn't always enough if you're given nothing to go on from the start.
Sure, there are schelling (?) points and so forth.  Certain lifestyle
habits come through.  (One list member who I spoke with by
telephone regularly derived a great deal simply from my phoning habits-
you know who you are- Kudos).  Even all this together, however, is not
always enough to narrow down the field too closely.
Keep in mind that I've attended cypherpunk meetings and met personally
with no less than 3 c'punks in the last several years.
My point?  That I'm immensely clever and trained in the shadowy world of
secret identities?  Hardly.  My point is that minimal effort can be
extremely effective.  In effect, anyone can do it.
I'm sure some clever participant at DCSB will do a pile of homework before
coming to my talk and put it all together.  So be it.  If he or she is
polite, they might chide me in private a bit, but not blather all over the
list just to show how very clever they were.  As long as they enjoy the
talk, I'm not overly concerned.
I do less work for private clients who's sensibilities I'm particularly
concerned about.  I spend more and more time out of the United States,
and, frankly, cypherpunks in general have received me warmly.  Most large
posts I made attracted at least a few "thank you's" or "could you tell me
more's."  In many ways this was much more rewarding than work for which
renumeration was forthcoming.  I hope I've given something back.
This brings up my final point.  Reputation.
After a while with the nym, the value of reputation became clear.  A
"cartoon" handle required more than the usual amount of reputation and I
found myself often taking more time with long posts and list research
projects than I might of had my real name been attached. (!)  Reputation
has value in more than one way it would seem.
Whatever comes of my visit to Boston, and snide remarks about my "teasers"
aside, I've enjoyed cypherpunks, even with the noise, and hope I can
continue to do so for as many years to come.  While less important,
today, privacy is still an issue for me.  Do be considerate and refrain
from taking photos and the like just for kicks.  I'm hardly going to be
obnoxious enough to have everyone frisked as the enter or the like, do me
a favor and make my guess that such measures are unnecessary among
cypherpunks the correct one.

"Me too."
Seriously, this is the best course of action.
A friend of mine tells an interesting story.
On driving to a convenience store early in wee hours, he sees a man
splayed across the hood of a parked car, perhaps dead.  Being the good
citizen he is he tracks down a police car and reports the incident.
Instead of investigating the "body," the police decide to pull him over
and write him $700 in tickets for various fictitous violations (all of
which were later thrown out).  He, as would any reasonable
citizen, protested, not so much for the tickets, but for the
possibility that the prone man might need medical attention.
(The incident was not called in on the radio).  He took the
tickets and remarked something to the effect of, "I can't
believe this is what one gets for trying to be a good citizen,
trying to get involved."  Officer's response:  "Yep.  Next time don't bother."  Eventually, some 30 mintues later the police drive to the
location and revive what was a sleeping bum, take my friend to the station
and make him wake his wife to bail him out to the tune of $250.
Total cost: $300 in legal fees to fight the "violations."
the highly unlikely event that he might somehow become the prime suspect
of a murder investigation and counsel suggested he do so.
Whenever a police officer asks questions more substantial than "can I see
your license" or "do you have registration" he simply clams up shurgs
his shoulders, or otherwise makes completely unsubstantial responses which
drip apathy from all four corners.
If questioned about his non-responsiveness he smiles patiently and begins
"Let me tell you a story officer... once upon a time a man was minding his
own business at 2am on the way to the convenience store...."
You can never win.  Don't try.
Readers might remember my own account of being interrogated for attempting
to purchase a car in cash at a "we hate drug dealers" dealership in
Virginia.  Cops know enough to play on human nature.  Most people want to
show the officer they are cooperative, to prove their good will.  Most
people will try to win the war of wits and waive away all their rights
simply because an officer asks if its ok with you if he violates your
rights politely.
"If you have nothing to hide, why can't I search the trunk?"
"You don't mind if I come in do you?"
"Why don't you come down to the station, it will only take a few minutes."
"If I find anything after I get a warrant, I'm not going to be happy."
"We can do this the easy way, or the hard way."
"Who are you protecting?"
"Tell us how you found the napsack, we want to make a training video."
What most citizens fail to do is call the bluff.  If every citizen made
every curious police officer go to a magistrate and sign for a warrant,
police would be a whole lot more careful about which cases they decided to
bother a magistrate with.
Be patient.  Make them get the warrant.  Make sure you tell them,
politely, that it is your hope that more people will do as you have, that
the magistrate will begin to wonder at all the warrant applications that
are suddenly coming in for this officer and the lack of corresponding
arrests.  Perhaps someone will pay attention.

Yearbooks are literally a publication.  If you wish to be extreme about
privacy, it is hardly prudent to allow your children's name and face to be
linked in a widely diseminated publication.
Fingerprints are not mandatory, or even requested, on all driver's
licenses.  Many states do not keep copies of the photos.  The only records
available are name, DOB, etc.  (Illinois was one of these, but I haven't
checked lately).
Avoid getting a social security number.
You can list them as dependents for several years if you stall with the
IRS about their social security number.  The worst I have even seen the
IRS do is send (rather bland) letters complaining about the number being
in error.  They hardly have time to follow up on each one.  And if they
do, failing to apply for a number is hardly a crime.  Each parent could
easily say "I thought you did it."  "No, honey, you did."  "No, I didn't."

Social Security Administration.  Even the IRS can't "get" it from the SSA,
they simply get a note from SSA which says "the name and number here don't
match up according to our records."  If they could get the number, they'd
just correct it, rather than sending you letters about it ever 6 months.
Extremely unlikely as the SSN is used to key the credit search.  I don't
want to encourage fraud or the like, but their ability to check for false
numbers is limited.
Depends on the state.  Some yes, some won't check, some require SSN cards
but accept alternative identification, some say no but will let you if you
complain enough.  You get the idea.
This, again, depends on the state.
The SSN is available to police only if it is in a DMV or police record.
They cannot (excepting perhaps in extreme emergencies, though I've not
heard of such) get it directly from the SSA.
Make a mistake on your form.  When the IRS discovers it, they will send
you, and perhaps your employer but I'm not sure, a letter complaining
about the error and telling you they cannot help you with this and you
have to go to the SSA to deal with it.
I have seen letters which threaten to withhold returns, but usually enough
complaints results in a return being issued anyhow.
See above.
There is no way to verify that your SSN is correct if you did not tell
anyone what it was.
As inconvenient is it is to give private businesses a string of random
As I mentioned, I have two associates who don't have, or have never used
their numbers and live quite happily in the United States.
The weak link is the fact that the SSA will not issue the actual numbers
to anyone but the applicant.

Personally, I suggest that the dependent be identified with an erronious
SSN number.  If the dependent exists it is hard to make a fraud case and
the deductions are usually allowed anyhow.
I'm not sure what "a variety of reasons" in the highschool years is.  As
for hastles, I can't think of what they might be, other than going to the
SSN web page to construct a properly formatted number which the SSA will
report as "Issued" (as opposed to "Unissued").  This is one of the few
pieces of information that is given out.
Again, DMVs cannot check to see that the number matches the name, only if
it was issued and if the first three digits correspond to location where
the number was supposedly "issued" from.  (If not one can always claim to
have lived in the state that DID issue that number).
I disagree.
The lack of a social security number makes the first part easier.  They
are most certainly connected in the research into the few clues that will
have to slip out, will not lead back to any fact which can be later used
to narrow down the field.  (The first three numbers of a SSN for example).
Pity, but still, you can avoid it without sacrificing the dependent
I don't understand why this is so.  Perhaps I missed a link in the chain

You didn't read very carefully.  I'd hardly call the modest efforts I made
extreme.  This was the entire point.  If explaining my successes with
moderate efforts so that others might duplicate it (I think that apathy is
why more nyms [like yours] are unsuccessful as privacy tools) then how is
that self-indulgent?
You fail to not that dissociating one identity from another requires the
existence of two identities.  Is the second any less entitled to
protection than the first?
No.  That is the pseudo-cpunk attitude.
The real cypherpunks attitude can be illustrated thusly:
Two men are walking down a street, a psychologist and an economist.  They
happen along on a $100 bill.  Thinking he will evaluate the response of
the economist, the psychologist ignores the clearly visible bill.  To his
surprise the economist ignores it as well.  On asking the economist why he
did not pick up the bill, the psychologist recieves this answer:
"If it was really a $100 bill, someone would have picked it up already."
An old joke, but it makes an important point.  It is not enough to know
how the market system works, but also to participate it.  This is why I
believe using those legal tools that are available is an important step.
There is no morality other than the morality of the market.  I submit that
we do not need a central authority to dictate morality.  We need only
individual views of morality.  There will only be as large a pornography
market as there is a demand.  Ditto for narcotics, guns.  If the market
believes that porn is immoral, customers, by their own moral decision,
will reduce the market to nothing.  Of course this will not happen
in the near future because the cost of this moral choice exceeds the
benefit for many customers.
Why is use of the legal system any different?  If it is so wrong for me to
use the legal system as it stands, and if I am to be the subject of
criticism for the conduct, then aren't the critics imposing their moral
view on me?  Isn't this what libertarian cypherpunks dislike in the first
The bottom line is that the decision to sue is much like the decision to
use a legal tax loop.  I would call "idiot" the person who refused to
utilize that which the government hands him. (Did not Mr. May indicate
that the $1000.00 or so that the government would hand him was too costly
to lose, even in the face of estlablishing privacy for his children?  In
my view that is a rational decision.  Mr. May has priced privacy.  My
objection to his rationale was that I think the cost of obtaining it can
be significantly lower).
If the government is going to hand me the means to curb conduct which may
be harmful to me, why should I refuse to use it on some "moral" grounds.
(The moral grounds might consist of "well it's not a nice thing to do." but other than that, I am at a loss to identify them precisely).
I submit that if law suits are so harmful and create such loss, eventually
they will be eliminated by one of several mechanisms.
Cypherpunks that they might speed the process by using that entitlement
which the government gives them.

Let's sum this up.  Government intervention via law suits is a bad thing.
And this:
Law suits (and thus government intervention) are prone to abuse.
And this:
Use of law suits may expand the use of nyms.
You just made my argument for me.
Again, have to use the system to expose its flaws.
Same thing with privacy.  It is one thing to suggest that people respect
privacy because it is the "right thing to do."
Isn't it much more productive to make privacy unviolable from the
beginning via technology?
Readers might note that one of the result of my settlement agreement with
a certain flamer who decried the use of nyms (among other things) was this
flamer's eventual resort to the use of a nym.
Interesting lesson that, I believe.

The problem with people too used to dictatorships is that they grow
so accustomed to taking those favors and incentives which are dictated to
them that the freedom (and responsibility) of "financial gain" seem like
too much work.
Much easier to just work for food.  "The all-knowing General Pinoriega
would have given us money if we needed it."
Of course the result is an increased dependence on the state.
Market economies which approach true "free market" status provide no
foothold for regulation.  You cannot really have one without the
other.  (Note the coming backlash against free speech and free markets in
the United States).
The free market will ever be the only real path to free speech, because,
in essence, it is free speech.
Free speech does not, however, require that all speech be universally
broadcast to each and every citizen on the planet free of charge.  That's
"subsidized speech."

Ah, so let's ignore the risks, on the grounds that we have no idea what
they might be, or their magnitude.  That's clever.  I like that.
Your circle of associations must be limited.
Agreed, but since you do not quantify the magnitude of either of these,
even in terms of speculation, I'm not sure what your point is.
And no one can answer that question but you.  Privacy is a personal
decision.  I'm sure there are many out there who will suffer no harm even
if their SSN is published in the Wall Street Journal.
Why, however, fail to take out insurance when the cost is so low?  Really
it doesn't take much in the way of effort or money to assure one's
privacy.  (Hint: It's getting cheaper every day in some ways).
Answer: Nearly all of the cost of privacy is concentrated in set up cost.
Maintaince costs are minimal once set up has been made.  Yet getting over
that first hurdle is the biggest leap.

That which is broadcast is certainly speech.
Trying to draw some kind of "right to be broadcast" as a result is
stupidity or ignorance, or both.
Anyone has the right to, e.g., start a mailing list, or a newsletter.
No one has the right to compell ABC or FOX or John Gilmore or anyone
else to broadcast their speech.  (The rarest exceptions, like equal time
rules, exist in election contexts).
Learn the difference.  Go to law school before you argue free speech
concepts in any detail.  Most importantly, spend more time thinking, less

A J.D. is not a true Doctorate, and even if it were, it would not be the

Georgetown, as an example, offers a Doctorate in Law degree which requires
a J.D., an LL.M. and three years of legal teaching experience simply to

A Doctor of Judicial Science program is also available with many of the

Both programs require a dissertation and a defense of same.

It's not a new concept if thats what you mean.  Has many names.  "Canary
trapping, imposed distribution attributation" and others.
Generally either a single non-spelling error is introduced (generally with
punctuation), or several errors are introduced in different patterns
throughout the document.  Word order is another common variation to use.  At the most basic level, a script could easily introduce e.g., a
semicolon in place of a comma once in a document, and in a different
place for each document. The "phantom serial number" of a given document
is obtained by counting the commas encountered before a semicolon is
found.  If a correlation between serial number and original recipiant is
maintained, the first tier of the avenue by which the document is escaping
is easily identified.
Of course this method assumes that the documents are distributed onward
without alteration or summarizing.
More complicated variations can be introduced as is needed.
(Paragraph/subject order, names of participants, etc.)
Coderpunks might have a harder time.  For obvious reasons technical
writings are much more sensitive to even minor alterations.

If the document that goes to a newsgroup is document  then you can
concentrate on the path after   Which newsgroup is it?  Easily
determined by selectively seeding documents to different newsgroups.  You
get the idea.  Message pools complicate the process, but are not
impossible to deal with, particularly when output to the newsgroup can be
controled, as it can here, either by killing the feed the the group, or to
the party posting there.
This all of course begs the question as to whether this is even a good

Take the case of Ripco (the Chicago BBS raided in the SunDevil raids back
I don't think "Dr. Ripco" has yet gotten his equipment back.  I don't know
for sure, but what I do know is that 5 years after the raid, he still had
certainly not gotten anything back.  Keep in mind that the feds took
everything which even looked computer-like in his rather substantial
workshop, including telephones, VCR equipment, burners, the works.
Recall also that Ripco was never specifically charged (or the minor
charges that they did try to pin didn't stick).
Also recall that Ripco (now ripco.com) was raided with a -sealed- warrant.
I dont think that the contents of that warrant have, even today, been
released (though I could be mistaken).  Certainly 5 years after they had
See my past article on this case.
Nice summary.
I'd argue with computer hardware it is a distinction without a difference.
Seizing computer hardware (like Ripco's stuff) for in excess of 5 years is
tantamount to forfeiture given depreciation and so forth.
Add to this the very liberal rules about how long the feds can take to
even CHARGE you with a crime after seizure....
RICO has the same problems, and also in the context of innocent 3rd
parties.  Innocent owner protection is mostly in the form of definition.
Specifically what is an "instrumentality of the crime" and what is a
"passive object" which just happened to be involved.  The real weakness is
that this is generally a question of law and tends to end up in the hands
of judges, not juries, to decide.  It has factual elements, to be sure,
but not enough in the current construct to make me feel secure that a jury
is really the only gateway to finding something an "instrumentality."
Again, I would argue that such a statute needn't even exist given the
rules already well estlablished and demonstrated in action with regard to
indefinate seizure of computer hardware even in the absence of criminal
claims against the owner.
Also, take note that many states are adopting unique civil forfeiture
approaches.  Research into the federal system, while generally giving one
the flavor, cannot give you the full picture.  (Michigan and Indiana are
mavericks here).
Strictly speaking, he may be correct, however, I doubt very much that a
judge would ignore a motion for a temporary restraining order pleading
that the server in question is the primary income stream for the (ISP,
marketing company, bank, etc.).
Also note carefully the distinction between "instrumentality of the crime"
and "passive participating element" in the crime.  Now if the hacker was
co-owner of the server....
Again, I think the question of forfeiture somewhat meaningless in that
the server could be taken as evidence and not be returned until it's value

What would the above accomplish, other than to make travel more diffucult

demoninations?  Would there be two American Express Travelers checks?

It basically is now in the form of cash.  Certainly it is immensely
Already the case for sums over $10,000 and in many cases for sums over
$7,500 as a matter of corporate policy.
A painfully poor idea.  Just look to Russia's great ruble burnings for
proof of this.
Currently the reason that it is popular to speculate that this would have
any effect on illegal substances, the underground economy, or tax evasion,
is because the war on drugs and money laundering is unwinable.  By
definition it must be easy for capital to flow back and forth between the
United States and other nations.  The more difficult this is made, the
more difficult legitimate commerce is to conduct, and, in addition, the
more difficult it becomes to make investments from abroad in the United
States.  It is the failure of Law Enforcement to have any noticable impact
on organized crime or drugs that made them strive to impose currency
restrictions in the place of legitimate law enforcement in the first
place.  It was the "soft underbelly" of crime and all that.  Unfortuantely
it is a hard underbelly to find, a hard one to identify when it is found,
and not alltogether very soft.  So now babblings about split currencies.
What a surprise.
I understand the concept, it becomes easier to track exportations of large
amounts of money in the form of cash.  Unfortunately any idiot could
circumvent it with the ease of taking sand from the beach.  Just because
the United States SAYS a $100 bill is worthless unless its in the U.S.,
certainly does not make it so.
As to circumvention: Form domestic corporation.  Purchase stocks, bonds,
other non-cash negotiable instruments.  Sell said instruments and demand
payment in DM or SFr etc.  Export foreign currency to the free economy
nation of choice.
All it does is move the laundering process onshore, and then only in the
first step.  Most money laundering uses non-cash exportation methods
already.  Diamonds are becomming more and more popular because of the
recent stability of uncut stone prices and the fungibility of diamonds as
a currency.  Luxembourg currently has the most potent diamond market in
the world.  Close to 45% of it is estimated to be operating as currency.
(Markets seeing the same stones over and over again).  Moreover, the cost
of exchanging stones in terms of middleman profit is often less than that
charged by large scale money laundering operations.
Those are the most basic of evasions.  I can come up with complicated
ones in seconds, and boggling ones in minutes.
In addition, as a solution, it fails to anticipate the foreign market for
domestic bills.  Surely I could exchange currencies with the casas de
cambios that will certainly be created to take advantage of the new
regulations about a week after they are inacted.
It has born this kind of scrutiny before.  Time and Newsweek were onto the
story almost two years ago.  Considering that something like 3/4 of the
circulating supply of U.S. currency is abroad, you tell me how practical a
program this is.

Actually, given that in this case the defendant would have explicitly
claimed to have taken the software out on a laptop, all that would really
be needed to lend a bit of material to verify would be testimony by anyone
that he had a laptop of his own on the trip.

Works both ways.  It doesn't help that he admitted to the crime to his

I challenge you to find an airport today that will not hand inspect
laptops in checked bagage and either x-ray or hand inspect or both laptops
carried on.  I also challenge you to find an airport that does not keep
video tape records of their security areas.  If you do make sure to call
the FAA and report them as well.  I understand there is a reward for lax
security reports now.
All these speculations are idle where the defendant admitted to the means
he used to commit the crime.  Reasonable verification is all that is
required, and in some circumstances, not even that.
I'm not telling you he'd go away.  I am telling you that if I wanted to
prosecute the case, I'd make a very good run of it and without someone on

Merely enough to allow a jury to make a reasonable judgement to the
reliability of the confession.
Comparing export regulations to murder investigation undercuts your

Of course in this case the U.S. measures were rather a bit more dire, but
it does suggest a tacid recognition that there is nothing literally
illegal about being in contempt of court, even if it was an attempt to
resolve a conflict of laws problem in this case.
It's also worth noting that contempt of court is rarely punative in
nature.  (Different rules apply when it is).  Instead, it is coercive.
Force is applied in increasing measures until the individual either gives
into the court demands, or it is clear that force will not be of any
effect.  There is no real law being broken per se, merely an exercise of
power by the court.  If you comply, sanctions will be removed.  The only
sanctions which will be preserved after the fact will be those which were
levied to enforce compliance prior to that compliance.
All this is entirely academic in any event to the original point.  There
is no defined right to be in contempt, only the right of the court to
enforce its rulings and to compell testomony of unwiling witnesses.  The
fact that an act is not illegal does not make it a right.  There is
nothing I see in the constitution to support the argument that it is a
right in any way shape or form to refuse a lawful order of the court.

Unless you are an expert, you shouldn't be mucking around in engineering,
crypto design, legal work, or asset protection.  Consult an expert please.
No one has ever posted any real worth while "how to" instructions as to
how to diversify your stock portfolio either.  That's what professionals
are paid for.  You get what you pay for.  If you tell an investment
manager that protection from seizure is a consideration in investment,
you'll get results.  No one bothers to do this.  No one bothers to invest
in careful ways.  It's merely one more criteria and a rather mundane one
at that.  Yet no one bothers.
I posted the massive kludge I did because I hoped it would increase
awareness a bit.  I did get a pile of encrypted messages asking me if I
would help so and so invest $10,000 safely abroad for free.  Not exactly
the kind of work I do, but it does show the interest.
No one can expect real financial advice over an internet mailing list.
Let's not forget where we are afterall.  What I will tell you that it is
possible, and there is a market for the service.  A potent market.  I
don't know what Mr. May holds, what his interests are, nor what his
specific problems or dispositions are.  The thought that there is some
list member who can say "Yeah, just dump it into a foreign shell
corporation and reinvest it all in the U.S." is silly.  It's on par with
the radio ads which proclaim "You too can make a fortune in heating oil!
Doesn't it make sense that prices will rise in the winter?"  There is no
one good solution, and anyone who sells you a universal package is selling
you a bill of goods.
Careful, professional, and highest quality service is required to properly
design any investment design.  Again, you get what you pay for.
The precursor to getting the market for asset protection to be wider scale
is to increase awareness.  In the way that the stock market is available
to the individual, I'd like to see (among others) the asset protection
market available to the individual.  Put the tools out there and begin to
isolate the experts from the general public.  There are, believe it or
not, very few experts today.  Most of them in banking secrecy
jurisdictions where the clients are.  That's stagnating.  Let's change
Crypto is mostly technological know how.  It is easily reduced to code.  I
submit that asset management is not..  Were it then the measure of a
profitable bank would be the power of its trading and investment software.
And if you are sending e-mail this is fine.  If you are designing a crypto
system for a financial instituion, it is not.  I'm surprised I have to
point out this difference.  I cannot believe that anyone on this list
could do more than tell the layman what NOT to do.  I can't imagine that
advice from someone on this list to a bank manager, or some other "real
money" interest would be anything other than "Don't do it yourself, ignore
the hype, ignore the how to guides and _seek professional help
immediately_."  I think also that many of the people on this list ARE the
experts.  That tends to make comparison to the level of asset protection
content on this list a bit skewed.  I don't know how many asset protection
experts are on this list, I suspect the number is smaller than the crypto
expert one.
I will be the first to denounce the "pay no taxes" "hide your assets"
"second passports" ads you see in the back of the Economist.  In my
personal opinion, "Scope" and all that perpetual traveler literature is
trash.  In my professional opinion, anyone with over US$200,000 in free
assets can benefit from some restructuring.  In some cases with minimal
increase in long term fees and often with a _substantial_ increase in
personal attention and service.  The American banking market is robust,
but hardly attentive.  It is a retail market and is designed in most cases
like fast food counters.  U.S. banks make a pile of money on fees because
people are lazy in the United States.  They would sooner use the atm right
in front of them than walk a block and save a buck in fees.  Walking might
be worth it, but I submit that the consequences of poor asset management
are almost never worth it.
I suggest that you just walk into a bank in Luxembourg, Liechtenstein,
perhaps in Switzerland and compare the experience to doing the same in the
United States.  It may be a bother to get to a real bank, but the
difference in service, attitude, and skill can be substantial.
You get what you pay for in sweat too.

I've never been fond of some of these for a myrid of reasons.
Someone will indeed say that.  I am not that someone.  The lack of tax
avoidance materials directed towards U.S. interests is mostly because
there are very few offshore tax avoidance options open any longer to U.S.
citizens.  Most have been very effectively legislated away.
An unsurprising result.
If tax avoidance is your major concern, there is not a whole lot more I
would do.  I may have some suggestions, but taxation is not really the
kind of thing I could do you any good with.  Whatever I did suggest would
be more fine tuning than anything else.
Unless you are engaged in major international business, there are few
taxation breaks for U.S. citizens.  I believe I've discussed this before.
But the concern I raised was not tax avoidance, for which offshore
solutions provide little help to the average U.S. citizen, but asset
protection.  Political Risk protection.
I wont presume to analyze your financial holdings, but it sounds like a
substantial amount is in stock.  That's vulnerable to all manner of
I don't know your situation exactly, but it is my view that in general,
and in my personal experince, holding large amounts of U.S. stock solely
in your own name is a bad idea.  I'm not suggesting that these assets be
hidden from tax authorities, but involving the laws and stability of
another goverment in the ownership determination is a nice thing to do.
If an individual makes accurate disclosures on his or her tax returns is
not something I'm going to get into.  I'm simply talking about structuring
the assets in such a way that attacks on you personally won't necessarly
impoverish you as well as anything else.
I'm not for hire.  I'd be happy to suggest, in person, some financial
institutions in which I have no interests which you may wish to
investigate, none of which are less than 100 years old.
I can tell you some of the things that might be suggested to you.  A
banker might suggest estlablishing a foreign trust, in one of many
different forms, and reinvesting the funds in the U.S. market as you wish.
It will be suggested to you that you make all the proper disclosure to the
tax authorities of the United States, but also explained to you that
outright seizures of the funds will be resisted with vigor.  Records
will be outside of the United States with the exception of your tax
filings which are of little use to someone trying to outright seize
assets abroad.  Much better than you can expect in the United States
without doubt.  You think Citibank is going to fight in court to withhold
your records?
It might be suggested, if you have more active interests, that a
corporation be formed, that the assets be placed under management in that
form and left more convertable.
The point is that you involve another jurisdiciton in confiscation
proceedings.  This is not a matter of getting rich quick, or filling out
this "declaration of personal sovereignty" form.  It's not about tax
evasion either.
This is only one aspect of asset protection.  If you don't trust the U.S.
government to give you a fair shake, or if you feel you might eventually
be the victim of a suspicious persecution, or if you are wary of the
political winds in the United States, I would think you would run, not
walk, to deposit some money abroad.  Thousands of Europeans saved
themselves, their families and their fortunes by being a bit skeptical
about keeping their money in one country in the 30's and 40's.  This was
the original and completely legitimate reason that Switzerland and
Liechtenstein became known for banking secrecy.  They were equally
friendly to Nazi's who hid wealth before during and after the war I
might add.  This is, in my view, as it should be.  Financial
institutions should not be interested in the politics of their
clients.  That nosiness is the path to more intrusive invasions and
any financial institution which exhibits these trends should be
avoided at all costs in my view.  Most of the Islands came to popularity
during the 70's and the 80's tax evasion and drug money crazes.  Their
reliability is to be considered in this context.
I'm not selling my services here.  I have enough to worry about without
the cypherpunks rushing to retain me to manage their money.  (As much of a
fan of pseudonymity as I am, I will tell you not to give money to a nym
for asset protection reasons unless you are that nym and I'm not about
to expose myself to someone on the list because they claim to have
$25,000 to invest).
There are no U.S. banks which will do this kind of thing because banking
secrecy and questioning the legitimacy of asset seizure proceedings is
something viewed with suspicion in the United States.  This is not so
everywhere in the world.  It is not illegal, last I checked, to give
a foreign bank the privilege of managing your money.
The day it becomes so is the day it becomes apparent that the United
States expects eventually to have to wrech that money from you by force.
It will also be the day it is too late.
Look, I don't know if there is a revolution around the corner which will
make numbers in the Citibank computer disappear or something, but I sleep
better knowing that my money is not at the mercy of the political tide in
any one country.
Thanks for ommiting me.  :)
Seriously, there are much better banking and management services to be had
than exist in the United States.
I was talking to another list member about the differences.  I don't
recall who it was, but he might wish to chime in on the subject.
I'll suggest some places to look to anyone who enquires seriously.
Currently I don't do direct referrals, and I don't sell the financial
services of institutions in which I have an interest.  In the rarest of
cases I would consider writing, free of charge, letters of introduction
to european institutions for extremely serious and credible investors but
I make no promises at all.
This is not legal advice.  You didn't pay for it.  Do your homework whatever it is anyone tells you.

Disagree strongly.  The islands are very conscious of their image

I understand that it's difficult for you to grasp how firmly entrenched
the concept of wiretapping is in law enforcement, courts and the
legislature, and that your novel new approach has been tried before.
Part of the reason its hard for you to understand is because you haven't
bothered to go check.  Instead you have to look for civil libertarian
lawyers to try and say what you can't because you haven't looked.
You repeating your claim over and over again isn't going to get me to lift
a finger to research it for you.  You've been given several suggestions as
to where to look to show the massive holes in your claim in about five
minutes.  I think if you were to give it a try you would redden quite
quickly on realizing how hard us "imaginationless" lawyers were laughing
at you all this time.
This is nothing new "Vlad."  It's been a point of contention for over 50
years and a well settled one for the last 25-30.  Go look it up.
I also call upon you to look at the sources of these claims.  Stewart
Baker, now at Steptoe and Johnson, formerly of the NSA, heard speaking at
the ABA Conference on Law Enforcement and Intelligence.  Michael Vatis,
also heard speaking at the ABA Conference, sidekick of Gorelick and young
shining star in the Justice Department.  These are the people who will
benefit from associating wiretap and crypto because wiretap is extremely
unlikely to be challenged as an investigative tool in any way shape or
form.  These are the arguments of the law enforcement side.
You are shooting crypto in the foot if you allow wiretapping into the
argument.  You are doing more damage than good.
No, what gets to the core of the debate about key escrow is whether strong
encryption which does not comply will be made illegal to possess or use.
This is a meaningless detour and a waste of time.  So much so that I
wonder if you are not working for some local agency (I say local because
your posts are simply not crafty enough to be any kind of concerted
disinformation attempt on the part of authorities with wider briefs).
Meaningful attempts to derail Clipper will come along the same lines they
always have.  Economic objections made by industry and challenges to
thinly stretched regulations like ITAR which have been untested in the
vein before.  Revamping the country's entire wiretap law is not only a far
fetched project, its nearly a wild goose chase.  Please take it elsewhere.
Notice, however, that he doesn't suggest trying to overturn the wiretap
laws to get at Clipper.  Same distinction there too.
Law enforcement says "We need this power" attorneys with the Center for
Democracy and Technology (which by the way, while "Vlad" respects in
terms of legal prowess, I do not) whine "But they never should have
gotten wiretap technology in the first place."
You really thing that's a positive argument?  Go for it.  Dedicate your
life to the subject.  You have all my encouragement.
I won't be talking to Weitzner obviously.  It a losing man's argument.
"We wouldn't be in the mess we are in now if the Supreme Court hadn't
gelded the 4th amendment in the early years of its development."
Good luck.
If Weitzner's credentials are so impressive, why isn't he in private
practice where the big money and influence are?  That's where Stewart
Baker is.  That's where Gorelick is heading.  That's where Freeh is
headed, and it's what Vatis will be up to in 3 years time.
Then it seems you should take the discussion to the great legal mind of
our times, Weitzner, rather than waste our time and bandwidth with it.
So call him and foster such a challenge "Vlad."
I'm anxious to hear about your progress.

I disagree.  There is lots of potential precident.  The entire concept
that data voluntarily turned over to a 3rd party is not entitled to 4th
amendment protection (i.e., pen registers) is just the one that happens to
jump to mind.  The fact that the government has had to deal with
the breakup of ma bell and cooperate with several different phone
companies now suggests to me that not much of a leap is required to
include ISPs.  Constitutional arguments that ISPs are somehow different
from phone companies and therefore not required to comply with wiretap
orders?  Good luck.
I know its fun to make the argument that ISPs and E-mail and NetPhone are
all new technologies and so it must be unconstitutional to regulate them
but the amusement in these cases stems from a wish that it was so, not
fact or reason.
Are there some flexibilities in the developing law?  Yes.  Are they going
to make all e-mail and electronic communications legally untapable and
immune from electronic search warrant?  Of course not.  Don't be stupid.
This is what technology is for.
Why bother with all this trash?  Use SSH and end to end encryption.  End
of discussion.  See how much simpler and cheaper that is than trying to
get the supreme court to kneecap the police and the feds?  Hint: If you
don't, you're on the wrong list.
"I content that a phone company should be entitled to enter into a
contract with his customers in a way which obligates him to structure his
business to minimize his ability to cooperate with police when given a
search warrant."  Yeah.  Good luck.  Switch phone comapny with "deli" or
with "employer" or with "interstate shipper."  Same result.  "Good luck." Find me a General Counsel who would let their firm do that and I'll find
you a wonderful canidate for a malpractice suit.  I would suggest you
study the contractual doctrine of "Illegality" and state statutes on
"Obstruction of Justice."
Why even involve the ISP?  Why would an ISP want to do this and expose
themselves to potential liability when the end user could just do it
themselves?  I don't remember this point, but if I ignored it it's
probably because its just lacking in any remarkable insight.  Actually it
doesn't even seem to have undergone the scrutiny of 10 minutes
The entire advantage of encryption is that it moves the burden and ability
to protect communications to the end user.  There is no need to depend on
the phone company, an ISP, or anyone else but the person with whom you are
If you want an ISP to encrypt all your mail as it shows up (a strange
request to begin with because of the potential for some third party to
encrypt with the wrong key or etc. and destroy the data permanently) you
are introducing a third party into the equation which you now have to
trust and depend on as far as resistence to government coercion goes.
(You seem to have identified this problem below, but in a way that
suggests it just occured to you or that this is just a stream of
consciousness blathering post).  I don't understand at all how this leaves
anyone better off.  I can point out explicitly, however, how it leaves
everyone worse off.
1. The government now has another party to squeeze (The ISP, who would
have been fairly untouchable if they had done nothing but forward e-mail).
2. The party receiving mail now has to depend on the ISP and some method
of contractual enforcement if the ISP breaks its word.  (I suppose this is
where it will be suggested that we just kill all the ISP employees).
3. The party sending mail now has to rely on the discression of the ISP
(From whom he/she has no contractual assurances at all).
What if they just packet sniff at the "In" plug of the ISP and cut the ISP
out all together?  Why bother telling the ISP anything if it's clearly not
being compliant?  Duh.  Same reason I would send agents to go around an
island bank which was not cooperating were I the IRS.  Of course, the ISP
could easily be charged in a conspiracy and obstruction action after this.
Where do you get this last part?  Arguably in the Jim Bell Court of
Invented Appeals perhaps.  Of course in that court the death penality
applies for parking violations if the complaintant is rich enough.
I refer you back to the concepts of "obstruction" and "conspiracy."
Neither has the argument that cows fly and therefore should be regulated
by the FAA.  How that lends the argument any merit at all is beyond my
Suggestion:  Start a foundation with this goal.  Let me know how far you
get.  Try calling some law schools and asking them if they might have some
students willing to work on the problem for free.

government.  Like it or not, government is the medium here.
Effectively there are three options.
1>  Convince government.
2>  Avoid governmnet.
3>  Overthrow governmnet.
Convince Government:  It is my opinion as a Washington resident, attorney
and beltway fever observer that this is impossible in any meaningful way.
I don't care how many industry people gripe, how many letters go into
senators, how many whimpers there are.  If the Director of the FBI, key
people at Justice, the Director of CIA and the Director of NSA tell the
President that their ability to enforce the law, conduct intelligence
operations and prosecute high profile cases is going to be severely
hampered by strong crypto, you can bet that something is going to get
done.  Crypto is on the radar folks.  So are anonymous remailers (and not
just the penet kind) and so are secure communications in general.  The
government, particularly the executive branch, is a lot more savvy on this
issue than even this list has given them credit for.  They have a 13th
Generation component (Michael Vatis is a great example) who are listened
to by craft superiors (Gorelick), know the issues, know the risks, and
know the weak points. Be very afraid.
Changing their mind is out of the question in my view, and efforts are
better directed elsewhere.
It would be a bit easier if crypto savvy types like our two .nl friends
(of "Binding Cryptography" fame) wouldn't provide them with gelding
instruments, but this is to be expected.
At this point, some original type will suggest that the people (a minority
to be sure as the number of people who know much about the net much less
crypto, while increasing, is unlikely to be very effectual) should just
start whacking officials who aren't crypto friendly.  Let's take it to
option  then and address this.
Overthrow Government:
Any student of international relations and/or internal low intensity
conflict will realize that there must be a measure of public support to
back any kind of organized revolt with political ends as its goal.
Terrorism hardly seems a prudent option.  Certainly a net terrorist today
could use his skill and expertise in causing a great deal more havoc with
a great deal less funding and general resource than a terrorist of yore,
but what irony.  Destroying the net to save it?  Bombing power centers to
make the internet free for all man?  Moreover, without larger scale
organization one never reaches the level of "low intensity conflict"
but rather remains at the level of "random terrorism."  The
effectiveness of random terrorism is, I think, historically quite well defined.  Essentially it is ineffectual alone.
To bring about the level of organization required to raise the stakes to
"low intensity conflict" or "organizaed revolt" some cadre of supporters
and popular sympathy is required.  Not likely in this case.
It's hard enough to conduct an effective low intensity campaign
with a easily understood mantra (like political system, religious freedom,
fundamentalism, etc.) but to conduct one with the goal of overturning
crypto regulations...?  I understand that many people on this list view
the crypto debate as an essentially free speech issue.  I tend to agree
with this view, but in terms of strict free speech nexi, I am in the
minority and even my agreement is tempered with the realization that such
an expansive reading of free speech is fringe at best.  The question
becomes not what is the right intrepretation of the crypto issue, but how
strongly public sentiment can be identified with the crypto issue itself.
This is a minimal, almost vanishingly small influence outside of this
So we are left with random terrorism in the name of free strong crypto.
Perhaps a few high profile incidents might come off without a hitch by
groups who have it together or have some more impressive leadership or
exotic background, but individual efforts are unlikely to accomplish a
great deal.
Between a few small group efforts and perhaps a single or two successful
individual efforts to make headline news in a few years times we have then
perhaps 5 incidents, two of which might be really scary if they involve
bombings or some such.  This would require at the very least 10-15
active participants, or in the most extreme case 7-10.  Given the past
preformance of the FBI I'd suspect that half or more of the efforts would
result in arrests.
As far as I can tell there are perhaps two or three members on this list
who would come anywhere close to doing actual terrorist acts to further
strong crypto at the moment.  Even by this quite generous estimate I think
its clear that in the next 3 years the liklihood of a government overthrow
or even a marginally successful terrorist campaign is vanishingly small.
Organized low intensity conflict is out of the question in this time
2: Avoid the Government
I am convinced this is the only answer.  It has essentially always been
the cypherpunk answer.  "Cypherpunks write code."  Cypherpunks get it
done.  etc.  Get the genie out of the bottle and keep it there.  This is
PGP, this is ssh, this is SSL, this is mixmaster, this is remailers.  Get
it out, get it working, get there first.
Ok.  We got some of it there.  Now what?  The lead time on crypto is about
up.  In my estimate regulation will be in place by 1998, if not earlier.
Remember that in many countries regulation already exists.
Efforts put on resisting or moderating crypto are fine.  Political action
is fine.  Even so I submit that technological action is more important at
this stage.  The delaying games are about over.
Where is highly sophisticated stego?
Where are larger keys for symetric ciphers?
Where is a fully functional and secure "stealth PGP"?
Where are anonymous and encrypted WWW clients and hosts which permit
If the crypto war is going to be lost it will be lost in the chill of
development when crypto regulation is put into place.
If you don't make the guns in the first place, the government has a much
easier time taking them away.
It is going to take a constitutional amendment or a very very favorable
Supreme Court ruling to keep strong crypto legal.
There is no "right to crypto," as much as Mr. Wood would like to believe
it exists.  Sorry Mr. Wood.  It isn't going to be as easy as all that.

I would refer you to Union Bank of Switzerland in the late 80's

money/offshore insurance fraud), PNC Bank (accounting fraud), and a host
of others I won't bother to list.  Banks do suffer from these disclosures,
in many cases quite severely.  (PNC bank was nearly ruined by their fraud
harboring disclosures).  Why exactly is it that you think frauds,
seizures, compelled customer referrals and the like go unreported to the
authorities in something like 75% of the cases?  Why exactly is it that
you think banks seek to open offshore branches with autonomy and distance
from the home branches?  Answer: Banking is as much about confidence as
any business can be.  Anonymous or not, the presence of funds which
infringe on regulations in one area or another are frightening to normal
banking customers.

Nor am I.
Most accounts during the period where the above incidents caused problems
were opened by proxy then transfered repeatedly.  The use of Swiss
"passbook" accounts in collecting kidnapping randsome was epidemic in the
1970s and 1980s.  These accounts, as they are bearer based and opened
through proxy, were entirely anonymous.
Many examples of effectively and literally anonymous accounts existed in
the 1970s and 1980s.
BCCI was famous for not caring who the account holder was, and shell
corporations were shamelessly used to conceal deposit taking and account
management by depositors who weren't satisified with trusting BCCI's
reputed "disinterest."

otherwise absent facts to support your argument, but please learn the

Both of these are affected by large scandals at banks.
In the case of the first example, runs on banks are hardly unheard of in
relation to major and even somewhat minor revelations about the source of
deposit funds where that source is criminal.  (Again, I cite Union Bank of
Switzerland which saw a three day run of almost $200 million after
disclosures about UBS accounts which were used for kidnapping randsom.
DeBeers was one depositor which explicitly attributed their account
closures to the news).
The rate of return is directly affected by costs to the bank.  Legal costs
(even in Switzerland) of defending against government and private party
discovery and compelled disclosure are severe.  Need I even discuss the
cost to the "legitimate" BCCI account holder?
And if customers are unconcerned about elements ther than  and why are such pains taken to invest in offshore institutions where the
costs (in sweat alone) can be higher?
The above incidents are easily found with a quick trip to the library.
The bottom line is that until anonyminity is not seen as some kind of
invariably criminal act with respect to banking, legitimate and
illegitimate money will be as like charged particles.
Next time, stick to web consulting.

Your point what that customers do not care.  I gave examples showing they
clearly do care.  The fact that disclosures of questionable banking l
practices cause customers to move their money is the active issue.  While
these may result in A and B above, that is entirely irrelevant.
account holders of their banks??
I'm not sure why this has anything to do with my assertion that anonymous
money, when connected to regulation infringing conduct, tends to repell
banking customers with "legitimate" sources, except perhaps that you felt
you had to do a little grandstanding.  For the record I agree that
Switzerland's curtailing of banking secrecy has driven out some money, but
bear in mind that it has also brough a lot of money in.  To state, by the
way, that Switzerland no longer upholds investor anonyminity (or depositor
anonyminity) is an innaccuracy and an oversimplification.  This is not to
say that I like the trend, just pointing out that you have managed to skew
the facts.
 > Because it is justified by avoiding government interference in their
 financial activities which in the long run increases their rate of return
 well above the added cost of doing so.
What connection might this have to the threat of increased regulation by
the banking authorities or the SBA due to large scale public disclosures
of questionable banking practices?  The answer is left as an exercise to
the student.

money without  running them over the coals first. Dam those nasty banks
all to hell,  they don't report every transaction of their investors to
every government that may be interested.  No, so you can verify that banks suffer losses following the disclosure of
questionable banking practices like randsom payoffs.
"legitimate" or "illegitimate" money. Banks should  not be forced to play
policemen, their job is processing money.
Where, by the way, did I indicated otherwise?
And, incidently, the terms legitimate and illegitimate money are related,
in my view, only to the presence of regulation, not the moral or ethical
standing of the funds themselves.
Given the woeful lack of facts and misconceptions you expose in your own
knowledge, I think you might wish to reconsider your own position and then
revisit the above line.

to know who that is I am sure a trip to your local library should help.)
Walter Wriston [sic] is in much disfavor in the banking industry just now.

research on banking and the actual nature of anonymous banking is renewed.

@_subject: Car Rental: Refusal to take Check Cards 
Curious about this policy I went out to rent a few cars this week with a
new check card from a local D.C. bank.
Here were my results:
Avis: Refused
Hertz: Refused initally, but accepted after coaxing
Thrifty: Refused
National: Refused
Alamo: Refused, got quite impolite after coaxing
Enterprise: Accepted, but only because the teller barely spoke english
Dollar: Closed
The policy seems to be well entrenched.  A few calls and some phone
jockying finally produced an explanation from Richard Vine, Assistant to
Edward L. McCarty the President and General Manager of Enterprise
According to him:
When the customer rents a car and uses a normal credit card, the
Rent-a-Car company "reserves" the funds which are essentially "In limbo."
By requesting an authorization from e.g., Visa for a certain amount, that
amount is deducted from the credit line of the customer.  The customer
cannot spend it away and it is essentially "reserved" for the rental car
company.  The rental car company, should they be forced to try and collect
funds, essentially has an option on the funds (a security interest in the
credit of the consumer?)
Check cards suffer from a few defects from the view of car rental
1.  The customer can stop payment on a charge.
Although I pointed out that a customer can likewise stop payment on a
credit charge, it appears that while the credit card issuers must adhere
to a standard requirement for dispute resolution (between merchant and
issuing bank) check cards often have no standard dispute resolution system
or no system at all.  This leaves the recourse to negotiations between
rental car company and consumer.  This often results in collection
procedures.  (Read, expensive)
2.  The customer can spend down the account entirely before the payment is
This cannot be done with credit cards as a portion of the credit line is
"authorized but not processed."
Essentially the rental car companies are concerned that they may never be
paid.  It seems check cards have been the subject of much abuse in this
field.  Check cards do not provide for instant clearing as far as I can
tell.  I think check cards simply give the account number to the
merchant's machine and then a "check" is printed out on the spot and
signed by the customer.  As far as I can tell, the transaction still
requires processing, even if it is a bit more automated.
One would assume that on the spot clearing methods (digital cash) would
solve this problem.  Just TRY, however, to rent a car with real cash.
I pointed out "Many check cards don't necessarily look like check cards,
how are you dealing with that?"
Answer: "We're working on it."
Cash is dead.
(The good news is that I had 2 rental cars to play with for the day.
Haven't yet decided if I should take the $200 out of my checking card
account before the transactions post).

1.  Digital Cash is on the map.  The Department of Justice will be
aggressively pursuing it.
Money laundering is becoming an increasing priority and crypto policy in
the United States is almost certain to be a casualty.  It's no longer, as
it seemed to have been 6 months ago, a question of "well until the
government finds out what the potential is, we are ok."  It is now: "Until
the government can manage to get the right people in an office together."
I'm not sure this is a particularly long time.
2.  Remailers are on the map.  The Department of Justice will be watching
these and an active effort to penetrate them is under way.  What this
means exactly is unclear.
The Department of Justice, according to Jeff Smith and acknowledged by
nods and "hmmm"'s of agreement from the DoJ panel members, is going to be
attacking remailers.  No idea how this may take shape, but its in the
works.  Beware Vatis and his ilk.
3.  Both law enforcement and intelligence are displayingh an unnerving
amount of cooperation.
No longer can we depend on turf wars to distract them.
4.  Might be a good idea to review implementations of crypto.
Both James Woolsey and Stewart Baker made sly remarks about the
reliability of crypto in the public domain.  While this is to be expected,
it might be a good idea to begin to look at crypto with a more discerning
eye.  In private conversation with Stewart Baker, my collegue mentioned
the potency of crypto algorthms in the public domain.  Wouldn't this make
criminal use simply too easy?  Should law enforcement not be considering
banning all crypto.  Baker wasn't giving away any secrets, obviously, but
he did suggest that tho many of the publicly available methods were
potent, their implementations might be weak.  (This while touting a cute
little "PGP" litigation bag.  Anyone know where these can be found?)
Perhaps its time to consider a more direct and careful implementation
review of IDEA, 3DES, MD5 and other common methods?
How widely reviewed is PGP's implementation REALLY?
What about other public products?

@_subject: ABA Conference on Law Enfrocement and Intelligence - Debrief 
As I got sidetracked and it has been awhile, I am reposting the entire
summary along with the second half, which I just finished.
Typos are all mine.
The American Bar Association Standing Committee on Law and National Security - Law Enforcement and Intelligence Conference - The ABA's Standing Committee on Law and National Security is one of the more successful Committees to come out of the ABA.  It's conferences and early morning breakfast briefings and lectures are attended by some of the leading experts in the fields of National Security, Law Enforcement, and Intelligence and no small number of the beltway power elite.
I'm not sure if many people outside the legal community understand the degree to which attorney's have impacted and thrived in both the law enforcement and the intelligence communities.  In fact many, if not most, CIA case officers and station chiefs, as well as field operatives, are attorneys or have law degrees.  Other intelligence organizations are no different.  It should come as little surprise then if a committee of the ABA should happen to attract a surprising amount of intelligence professionals.
This conference was no exception.  Spooks, Feds, Legislators, and even a few Kooks were in attendance.  Members of the British, American, Canadian, and German intelligence communities were in attendance.  A colleague and I attended the majority of the conference and except where noted the reflections below are a summary of our collective notes and thoughts on the subject matter discussed.  I'm taking a broad view of relevance to cypherpunks, but I will omit that which seems clearly not of direct or somewhat indirect interest.
Part One:
A Changed World for Law Enforcement and Intelligence in the 21st Thursday, September 19
7:45 AM  Registration and Continental Breakfast
8:15 AM  Welcome Remarks
Paul Schott Stevens
ABA Standing Committee on Law and National Security
8:30 AM  I.  An Overview of a Changing World.
*The Traditional Relationship of Law Enforcement, Foreign Intelligence and National Security (1945-1995):
*How Have Other nations Balanced Legal and National Security Requirements and Responded to a Changed World.
*The Changed Threats to U.S. National Security- New Problems and Elizabeth R. Rindskopf
Bryan Cave
Former General Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency
Member, Standing Committee on Law and National Security
Ms. Rindskopf outlined the three classic "periods" of intelligence community and mission development in U.S. history and set the stage for the discussions to follow.
Interesting subjects she did touch on included section 715 of the Senate intelligence bill.  The section allows the law enforcement community to request assistance from foreign intelligence in collection efforts on foreigners outside of the United States.
The BNC and BCCI scandals were discussed as a backdrop of the hazards of law enforcement and intelligence separation.
Zoe Baird
Senior Vice President and General Counsel
Atena Life and Casualty Company
Member, Standing Committee on Law and National Security.
Ms. Baird discussed the dangers presented by globalization and new technologies.  She highlighted the point that crime globalization often follows corporate globalization and the manner in which a single individual's ability to cause harm has increased in scope (The NYNEX Hack).  Also interesting was her discussion of the manner in which the more organized elements of criminal activity worked to take advantage of the very open society in the United States (Fund raising, publications, anonymous communications).
Those activities once merely violations of criminal law are, she argued, now increasingly national security concerns and that national security events impact elections in very dramatic and direct ways (Atlanta and Israel bombings as examples).
Crime, she pointed out, gets about an 80% response in the polls, where as "National Security and Foreign Policy" get perhaps a 3% response.  Merging these elements together serves an administration.  She also pointed out the trend toward making these issues generally more accessible to the public.  (Specifically by use of language.  "Transnational threats"- which was a term of art for non-state terrorism and organized crime- becomes "Global Crime" or "Global Lawlessness."
Ms. Baird ended by asking how the firewalls between Law Enforcement and Intelligence could be rebuilt with these new considerations in mind.
I considered her a balanced cynic.  She managed to get across some very realpolitik notions without much murmuring from the (limited) civil libertarian crowd.
David Bickford
Former Legal Adviser to the British Intelligence Services (MI5-
Mr. Bickford has in past served as a conduit between British Intelligence services and the United States.  He is well known and respected among the American and European Intelligence communities.  Knowing Mr. Bickford I can also say that he pays a great deal of attention to who his audience is and speaks to their interests with disarming accuracy.  His discussion is important because it is a good insight into what the policy makers in the United States are looking at.
He began by highlighting the new international nature of crime.  No longer is it confined to power blocs.  "Multi-jurisdictional illegality" is increasingly a concern.  New highspeed communications channels are a contributor and organized crime groups are possessed of extremely advanced administration abilities.  They are leaner and meaner because they use computers, encryption, communications, and use up less resources in administration.  The ability to make the organization smaller also makes it harder to penetrate.  In this environment, international cooperation is essential.  He called for more active and expansive extraterritorial jurisdiction for certain crimes, and lamented his own country's lack of enthusiasm for this concept though they are slowly "coming around."
His solutions included the labeling of organizations, even when they are not geographically based, as "illegal international organizations" and using all means to combat them.  He envisions a wide cooperation by the G7 to accomplish this, leaving such organizations with no safe haven.  Sanctions regimes formerly employed only as against "rogue states" and countries in disfavor should be employed to destroy these illegal international organizations wherever they are.  He indicated that the other G7 states should build on the recent Clinton Executive Order which seizes the assets of such organizations which may be located in the jurisdictions of the G7.  He called for measures to deny these assets access to the major securities and international finance markets and proposed that only organizations like the NSA could confront and complete these tasks.  Intelligence, he argued, is the only organization that can keep up with international crime and as a result there should be developed court processes to introduce intelligence into criminal cases while protecting the more sensitive information (sources and methods) as irrelevant.  "Evil men" have taken an "early lead."
$500 billion a year comes out of the United States alone in money laundering.  400 billion in assets is attributed to drug cartels, 80% of which are Cali Cartel assets.  There are over 250 international Russian criminal organizations currently operating.

Mr. Rodman discussed the new "trans-national areas."  Terrorism, corruption, economic and criminal activity.  He discussed the side effects of collapsing empires (the rise of organized crime to enforce property and contract rights that cannot be enforced by the government, the shift of power to the local from the regional and executive areas) and discussed, in this context, the importance of avoiding petty squabbles over issues like trade and the like because they threaten the more important strategic cooperation that will be necessary to battle global and transnational criminal activity.
Ms. Jessica E. Stern

Former Director, Russian, Uklrainian and Eursian Affairs,

Ms. Stern discussed the severe proliferation problems presented by a weak Russia, particularly the weakening of MPCA (Material Protection Control and Accounting).

Stewart Baker
Steptoe and Johnson
Former General Counsel, National Security Agency
Member, Standing Committee on Law and National Security
Mr. Baker's remarks were brief, but he discussed the evening of the odds with respect to government and private organizations caused by technology.
Admiral William O.. Studeman
United States Navy (retired)
Former Acting Director of Central Intelligence
Admiral Studeman discussed "Information Warfare," pointing out specifically that advanced societies were more vulnerable because of their financial, banking and revenue system's dependence on computer.  Power, air traffic control, public safety and media were also mentioned in passing.
Admiral Studeman went on to call for more intense secrecy in law enforcement (not intelligence) as to collection methods and new technology.  He called passionately for funding for the DigiTel program as well as a "key escrow" policy.
Anthony Oettiger
Chairman, Program on Information Resources Policy
Harvard University
Mr. Oettinger was perhaps the only moderate speaker in the conference.  He discussed Executive Order 13010 (establishing the Critical Infrastructure Protection organization) and called for more private sector input in policy making (Banks, markets, businesses want to make their own security arrangements, and are not very interested in paying much attention to the suits at their door who claim 'Hi, we're from the government, we are here to help.'

Proper threat assessing is important, and intelligence should be used to pinpoint the weak points.
Walter Pincus
National Security Affairs Reporter
The Washington Post
Mr. Pincus asked if (a lovely analogy to chicken little and osterages with their heads in the sand).  His most interesting remarks regarded the wisdom of dedicating such substantial resources to repell non-strategic efforts to disrupt networks.  (Hackers, lone gunmen, etc.)  He questioned.  Doesn't, afterall, a strategic attack require much more preperation?  Should we really allow the personality of e.g., Louis Freeh, who has the capital dazzled from his glow, to direct these resources?

Stewart Baker:
Mr. Baker, considering what his position once was, was surprisingly
mellow.  There wasn't much warning for law enforcement, he commented.
Cryptography lends itself to criminal activity and subversive warfare.
It's hard to reherse attacks because you have to do it on real live
For defenses, he suggests the following:
1. Monitor and protect government systems.
2. Launch attacks, both on our systems and on others.  (!)
3. Take note that attacks on private systems are the most worrisome.
(Financial institutions, exchanges, utilities)
There is a manifest mistrust between government and private sector
business.  Private parties are unlikely to accept help from government.
The liklihood of government systems being adopted is slim.
Banks, for example, make high security expenditures and the choice of
system is best left up to them.  (!)
There are, however, market failures in the private sector.
1. No one in the private sector bothers to protect against a simutanious
attack on power and telephone service.  This is HIGHLY unlikely to happen
by chance, but by design it is almost certain to happen in an attack.
2. Reporting of incidents.  Incidents are rarely if ever reported by
private sector interests.  (Flight of funds on reporting, bank runs, lost
of customers all make reporting incidents difficult to justify).
Collection or REQUIRED disclosure, Mr. Baker argues, is required.
3. Some minimum recovery mechanism is required.  There is no independent
information system for private sector interests because there is very
little financial incentive to build one.  How will the civilian system be
recovered after an attack?
Lee Bollinger
Dartmouth College
Mr. Bollinger discussed 1st Amendment issues.  He had, however, a strange
take on the way they should be broken down.  Namely:
Pro Crypto: ITAR as prior restraint.  Yes the 1st Amendment is painful
sometimes.  So what?  This is the cost of a freedom of speech culture.
Anti Crypto: This is a foreign affaris matter.  Courts are not fit to make
analysis here.  This is not the pentagon.  It is "Technical" data and
therefore outside 1st Amendment scope.
Kate Martin
Director, Center for National Security Studies.
The Center for National Security Studies used to be a section of the
ACLU, but has since broken off and gone its own way.
Ms. Martin pointed out that the FBI shouldn't WANT to get involved in the
sources and methods problems that taking intelligence information would
present.  The confrontation clause will present problems for the FBI if it
gets information which fall under intelligence "Sources and methods" and
then tries to use it in court.  (Greymail - Where the defense calls for
sensitive records necessary to the defense and if they get a ruling in
favor of the discovery, the government either has to make national
security documents public or drop the charges).
She also pointed out that in the current draft of the anti-terrorist bill,
the FBI can "task" the CIA to make collections abroad.  The CIA could then
break into a foreign residence, and look for evidence, find evidence
implicating a previously unknown American citizen in e.g., drug smuggling.
The FBI could prosecute the evidence, which was obtained without warrant
and would constitute illegal search in the United States, and the U.S.
Citizen would have, under current 4th amendment standards, NO STANDING to
move for exclusion of the evidence found by the CIA.
Howard Shapiro
General Counsel
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Mr. Shapiro was quite slippery.  He spent most of his time dodging Ms.
Martin's barbs by indicating that the FBI tended to err in favor of
applying the constitution even in extraterratorial cases (Achille(?) Laro,
where the terrorists were read their rights even though outside of U.S.
Territorial Jursidiction) and the the FBI would respect limits even if not
required to.  Rather weak argument, quite well presented.

Friday, September 20, 1996
8:00 AM Continental Breakfast
8:30 Overview
Philip B. Heymann
8:40 VI. New Uses for Intelligence as a Necessary Arm of U.S. Policy
R. James Woolsey
Shea & Gardner
Former Director of Central Intelligence
Mr. Woolsey made some very interesting comments.  He called rather
passionately for "Key Escrow," more potent funding for "DigiTel" but also
suggested that perhaps the dictator that was using modern encryption
"might not be hiding as much as he thinks he is."
10:15 AM  VII.  Law Enforcement and Intelligence
* Can Intelligence Technical Capabilities Better Support Law Enforcement
Objectives: What are the Legal and Practical Limits?
* Should Covert Action and Technical Intelligence Gathering be Available
to Law Enforcement?
* Rethinking Jurisdicitonal Lines, Roles and Responsibilites: Are New
Structures Required?
* The Law Enforcement and Intelligence Relationship; Past, Present and
* Can Common Standards be Achieved for Collection and Oversight?
Moderator: The Honorable John H. Shenefield
Morgan, Lewis & Bockius
(Introductions and short statements only)
Mark M. Richard
Deputy Assistant Attorney General
Criminal Division
U.S. Department of Justice
Mostly discussion of anti-drug efforts but a few interesting comments:
Internet banking is on the radar screen and there may soon be an
entirely seperate department of DoJ which addresses internet banking
crime.  DoJ is clearly leading the effort here.  Intelligence agencies
less so.
Jeffrey H. Smith
General Counsel
Central Intelligence Agency
(Soon to return to Arnold and Porter)
A few rather vague quesitons came up about anonymous transactions and
internet came up.  The Attorney general "is putting together structures to
attack that."  Rather ominous.
Michael A. Vatis
Associate Deputy Attorney General
Office of the Deputy Attorney General
U.S. Department of Justice
Vatis is a young shining star in Justice, a Gorelick protege and likely to
be the most dangerous individual to cypherpunks in the coming years if he
stays with justice.  Vatis understands remailers, encryption, PGP, even
mentioned "mixmaster" and so forth specificlly.  He is sly, knows just
when to shut up and is probably the front man on the DoJ attempt to attack
remailers and anonymous communications in general.  He is a real problem
for cypherpunks and the party is clearly over.
Jonathan M. Winer
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law
Enforcement Affaris
Winer's points of interest to the list were money laundering related.  The
tactic, he indicated, is to get foreign governments to adopt legislation
to make money launderers move elsewhere.  (The carrot and the stick
approach is used).  He did acknowledge the need for money laundering in
the intelligence community, and urged, vaguely, for cooperation as money
launding regulation "is an increasingly important priority."
He discussed, vaguely, the CIA "tasking" issues brough up by Ms. Martin.
11:45 AM  Luncheon
Jamie S. Gorelick
Deputy Attorney General of the United States
Ms. Gorelick most tooted everyone's horn for the increasing cooperation
that between the various communities.

that corporate policy adjusts to the market needs/risks).

Don't think I didn't consider it.  The conference was not attended by the

enforcement and intelligence.  These were either quite sincere snickerings
among professionals, or EXCEEDINGLY well laid misinformation put into the
wrong circles to be of any effect.
Again, nothing specific, but implementation seemed to be the key.  I would
also note that I don't typically pay such ramblings much mind.  When
Stewart Baker tells someone IDEA and 3DES are indeed strong but
implementation weaknesses can cripple them, and this in the context of a
law enforcement ban, I tend to listen carefully.

Again, don't panic, just review.

I, unlike EFF, have never compromised my efforts to make strong crypto,
unescrowed strong crypto, and digitial communications, free from the FUD
spouted by government and media alike.  I, unlike EFF, have never
compromised my efforts to resist the expansion of a wiretap state.  I,
unlike EFF, have never proported to be a political represenative for these
positions and folded under the weakest of pressures like a reed.
I would put forth that you know nothing of my efforts, and therefore are
in no position to judge me.  I would also put forth that the efforts of
EFF, or lack thereof, are quite public.
I think any organization that would apply political pressure rather than
bow to it would be an alternative.  I think an organization in touch
enough with its own policy to prevent its staff and board from making
embarassing big brother type proposals to curtail the ability of any of us
to post without attributation would be an alternative.  I think an
organization without the internal conflict and strife that has clearly
marred EFF in past and made it a laughable attempt at cohesive political
persuasion would be an alternative.  I think an organization that had
official policies on the core issues which it proposes to influence would
be an alternative.
In short, an organization that had even one of the needed elements of
legislative influence.  (Cohesive, directed, persistent, and
Now who's holier-than-thou?  What is so shocking about announcing that a
given organization does not support my interests and therefore calling on
others who share my interests not to make financial donations to said
organization?  Is there something EFF fears in free speech and political
consensus building?  Perhaps if they had a straightforward policy....
Were I to say that the Clinton administration has accomplished nothing but
oppression (not that this is necessarily my view) and that others should
place their resources elsewhere would you claim that somehow I was in the
wrong?  Political speech is in the air every day.  Learn to live with it,
even if you do not agree with the points contained within.
Phrased another way, who cares what you are tired of hearing?
That's what filters and channel changers and off buttons are for.
No, but when an organization espouses nothing on a given subject key to
its mission, what does that say?  What about when its members espouse
entirely different and even counter productive beliefs?  I would hardly
trust Senator Burns on the board of the ACLU, or a George Pacific
exec on Sierra Club's board.  What's different here?
I thought its point was to protect cyberspace?  What battles are left
after Digital Telecom, Anonymous Communication, Strong Crypto and CDA?
There aren't many battles to choose.  Let's seem some action.  I can sit

hunger prevention in Africa by "thinking very hard about the subject."
(Particularly not when I have accepted money to further that goal).
Are you one of those people who still believes you can get more flies with
honey...?  Ever been to Washington, D.C.?
Its fairly clear that they don't.  That said, why should I not make that
point known.  "Folks, EFF doesn't give a damn what I think.  If you think
what I think, then they don't give a damn what you think either."  This is
called POLITICS.  They are free to ignore people like me when we comment
that their public appearance is damaging them.  They will also pay the
price for doing so.  What kind of organization proports to support

the trap.  EFF _sounds_ good, and so its worth sticking up for.  Well
what, EFF, have you done for us LATELY?
If EFF is the best ally then we need to seek others.  They have done
nothing in my view to help keep strong crypto around, to secure a person's
right to speak without a citizen unit I.D. being attached, and to promote,
by extension, free speech.  Look, even you have gotten on my case here for
speaking without revealing my real name.  You think something I said
libelous?  Is it dangerous?  Would you like to contact me further about
it?  What precisely is the need to attach my real name to this work about?
It's about retribution.  It's about the need to see people unable to
really speak as they think, and the need to have words softened so no one
is "hurt."  Forget it.  I will not pay the political and financial price
of revealing my name just to make you, or anyone else, happy.

If you're going to ask me for money and support, you damn well better

Awww, poor EFF.  It just needs a little love and attention.
It's trying to be the best compromising entity it can be.  It's not fair
to criticize it.  We don't want to frighten it or anything, it might be
stunted for life.
Sometimes nothing at all can be a better alternative.
Again, I'm sure every violin in the place is playing for EFF and it the
powerful traumas it has to endure.  What do you think this is?  The
olympics?  I don't CARE how hard the job is.  You don't get things done by
being sympathetic in politics.  Maybe, Lance, that's how it works in
Colorado, but not in D.C.  Take the hearts and flowers crap elsewhere.  IF
they are asking for money I don't think that excuses are a luxury they can
indulge in.
If EFF is so sensitive that my comments will cause them to close their
ears to their potentially most interested constituancy, well, EFF is an
organization that needs to die and be replaced.
As I said before, you know nothing of what I am doing.  I don't buy the
"well then you do it" crap.  They are taking other people's money.  Do it
right because that is their JOB.  I don't have time to play about with
net politics in D.C. right now.  Nor, frankly, do I think my resources in
that area would do much good.  Maybe EFF can't do the job, which is the
position you seem to be taking, then maybe no one can and resources should
be allocated elsewhere.  Just don't come whining to me about how life is

I can, but I happen to believe that they are.  Look at the slips.  A

Hey, life is hard.  Sometimes people aren't up to the task.  Fine, admit

If EFF ranting is periodic perhaps EFF should take a hint?
Anonymity is currently the status quo.  Tell me, what exactly, if someone

forwarding a public number to the cell phone when you need to.  "Unlimited
forward" allows you to call your own number from anywhere and change
forwarding details.  Quite useful.
Many digital phone have caller ID which you could use to screen for
"urgent" calls when the time is pricy.
You might also consider giving folks a beeper number for "urgent calls"
and you could then call your voice mail from your cellphone to see if you
wish to bother calling back.
This has the added advantage of preventing the tracking of your movement
by determining which "cell" your phone happens to be on at the moment
(phones talk to cells when on but not talking).

"I have seen it repeated here often that somehow compelled identity is
some kind of a 'right' that one should have in all kinds of different &
important transaction, not merely on 'cyberspace debate societies.'  I see
here frequently the implication that *private*entities* that want to
enforce compelled identity in their own transactions are somehow
implementing a corrupt, orwellian system."
(That put it into prespective for you "Vlad?")
You are twisting, "Vlad."  If you really think that the issue is one of what specific times
government can demand anonymous transactions you overestimate the role of
government as well as the ability to demand such transactions on a per
situation rather than "as a whole" basis.
For example.  A friend of mine has never had a social security number or a
drivers license with his real name on it.  He has effectively had nothing
but anonymous transactions with anyone who thought that by asking him for
a SSN or driver's license they were getting identity credentials.  His
basis is philsophical, not criminal.  I might add that he lives quite
normally, works for a big mainstream company, and pays taxes.  Every once
in a while he switches his credentials around a bit to avoid paper
Please, if you can, point out the harm he is inflicting.
You can't.  There is none.  The harm you can identify is the classic "but
it might be used for... [insert nastiness in vogue this week here]"
It is reasonable for any private parties to refuse to do business with or
otherwise associate with parties who refuse to divulge their identity.
Government in a CryptoAnarchist Utopia will have a very hard time doing
business with anyone if they make this a requirement I think.
Tell me "Vlad," if government won't, who will?
I submit that it is impossible to enforce compelled identity other than
through government.  I also submit that to do it you have to create a
registration process for all mediums.  Pay phones, ISPs, private leaflets,
cash... etc... etc.
So long as cash and payphones exist, (or so long as cash and pre-paid
cellular exists) so will anonymous transactions.
Again, the question is, what are you going to do to prevent, e.g., me,
"Black Unicorn" from publishing as I do now?
Crap.  Such a system exists today.  It's called the "filter."
If you don't want to transact with anonymous people, then IGNORE them.
Why impose compelled disclosure on everyone?

Why the import of true "legal" names?  Why not simply develop reputation

What your suggestion basically says is "instead of developing our own
decentralized reputations system for filtering lets use one already in

Of course the problem is that you have to rely on the "Is a person"
judgment of the DMV which amounts to the education and judgment of the
$21k a year "administrative assistant" who stands at the door looking at
"birth certificates" and deciding whether to let people in.  Not only is
the reputation of such a system questionable, the system is centralized,
easily fooled by anyone with a dose of creativity, and hampered by
corruption and institutional disinformation (witness relocation,

In any event, getting reputation credentials from a decentralized "web of

@_subject: Risk v. Charity (was: RE: Workers Paradise. /Political rant). 
Yes, so?
Yes, so?
Understand what it is you are saying.
You are saying that everyone on the planet has a right to health insurance
and disability insurance whether they can afford it or not.  This is
folly.  The result is serious moral hazard problems.  See below.
Perhaps not.  A reasonable person will argue, however, that your rates
should be reduced and you should be placed in a lower risk group based on
criteria like employment, health history, marital status, number of
dependents and so forth.
(Charging the same premium for the 49 year old married non-smoking
female accountant with two kids and the inner city 18 year old corner
crack dealer is folly).
This is called "Risk pool seperation."
And while I may not argue for the prohibition of health insurance, I will
argue for compulsary payments for insurance policies - and against
socially funded insurance (Look up the term "moral hazard" - I'm not going
to provide you with an insurance vocab course).
Remember the original purpose of social security.  A government fund which
was self sustaining because it only gave out what was put in and gained by
Yes, but not for the reasons you would cite.  Social safety nets prevent
rioting by the lower classes, revolution and general civil disorder
because they appease the masses.  Indeed this is a form of health and life
insureance for the middle and upper classes.
This is absolutely silly.  Speading the risk alone does nothing.  The cost
for those who can pay is increased, and the cost for those who cannot pay
is made 0 (it already was 0 incidently).
It is also the reason the taxpayers (and not the savings and loan
community at large) were forced to bail out the failed financial
institutions.  Namely, because premiums were not tied to risk.  The FDIC,
as of last year in any event, charges a flat rate fee for all financial
institutions.  This is independent of any risk analysis of their
investments.  i.e., a financial institution that invests in trailor parks
in Arkansas pays the same premiums for federal deposit insurance as a
institution that invests in government issued debt instruments.  (There is
some ceiling for risk, but not a graduated system below the ceiling).
The result was (is) an incentive to risky investments.  If you are a
financial institution and I tell you "I will charge you $1.00 to insure
$1000.00 of low risk and low profit investments, but I will charge you a
while $1.00 to insure $1000.00 of extremely risky but highly
profitable option and currency investments" which one are you going to
choose?  (Hint, you're an idiot if you pick option The reason the insurance fund was depleted is because there was no risk
balancing built into the system.  The premiums did not cover the losses.
They would have if they were risk adjusted.
Spreading the risk, by itself, does NOT reduce cost.  You must properly
PRICE risk.
This is the distinction between insurance and welfare.  I suggest that you
read up on this topic carefully before you try to argue this subject.  It
makes you look rather clueless.
Welfare merely hands out money for those who have not bothered or cannot
afford insurance.  The result is an INCREASE in cost (taxes) to those who
are coughing up the cash so that they may support.
(I might add that no one in the United States today is denied catastrophic
health care.  Emergency Rooms are not allowed by law to discharge an
unstable patient.  You could be a bum on the street and be treated very
well by any global standards for a heart attack, stroke, car accident,
etc.  To argue, as you effectively do, that such people are somehow
entitled to millions of dollars in medical care so that they may, e.g.,
get a heart transplant, is an untenable position).
[Bloom County Nonsense removed]
Read: What you don't spend, you must give away.  (This of course ignores
the benefits to society of investing in e.g., the stockmarket, or
government debt, it also ignores the fact that anyone who manages to save

United States has already given up half or more of the value of his

I forgot to mention that welfare and free health insurance plans do not
SPREAD risk either.  They concentrate the risk of the entitlement eligable
population including those able to pay down onto the smaller group of only
those who earn an income substantial enough to contribute.
Those who can pay in are effectively burdening the risk of those who
cannot as well as themselves, instead of just themselves.

Your statement above is a loaded gun.  The decisions about what is or is
not medically necessary must by design be made by government in a
socialized medicine regime.  If I need to get in to why, it is because
you don't understand socialized medicine as well as you think you do.  As
for society as a whole being able to afford it, that's hogwash unless you permit serious restrictions on the definition of "medically necessary."
This evades an important point as well.  Namely, who cares if society can
afford it?  Should it have to?  Why is Joe Cracksmoker's fifteenth CBC
blood test a bill that the taxpayer must pick up?  Since when is every
citizen on the planet entitled to free health insurance?
Of course it's profitable.  Health care is not PBS.  There is a price to
be paid for getting someone else to promise to pay your bills if you get
sick.  To have it otherwise is to have a free lunch.  There is no such
The reality is that socialized medicine, in every example I can think of,
is merely low end health care.  Anyone who can afford it opts out of the
program and seeks the better quality and shorter lines within the private
health care system.  (Often in another country).
I'm not going to complain about it so long as you don't put me in a
position where I am asked to pay for every nerotic and friendless patient
who calls the ambulance on a lonely night for company.  (A friend of mine
once worked EMS Boston, by his estimate his ambulance alone ran up about
$7500 a month visiting ten or eleven such individuals.  They'd get a call
for a heart attack or somesuch and then some sweet old lady would invite
them up for coffee).
Oh, I see.  Let's give the program to the government then.  Good idea.
That will reduce the cost of the bureacracy.
And all of them buy into the notion that people are not to be made
personally responsible for their high risk behavior.  Instead, according
to these solutions, it is the role of government to identify it, and
discourage it.  I prefer market solutions.
Fact: I would sever my own festering leg before I would check into a

This is a classic effect of a black market economy for which there is
great demand, i.e., that regulation can only change the rules, not stop
the conduct.
I'm not sure why this is unusual.  This is all the SEC can do when there
are secret accounts used.
Prediction: The holders of the Swiss accounts will be before a grand jury
in 9 months or less.  The holders of Bahamian accounts, should they be
distinct from the former group, will never be found.  (Switzerland shares
information with the United States in cases like this with alarming
frequency, and often Swiss banks get waivers from clients who wish to
trade with Swiss accounts.  These waivers release the bank from liability
for cooperating with investigations involving such trades.
I'm pleased at this decision.  Misappropriation theory was designed by
creative prosecutors to solve a specific problem.  i.e., if Joe, employee
of Company X, tells Dave about an impending merger which Dave then trades
on, what fraud has Dave committed and against whom?  Dave is not an
"Insider" of company X, and thus had no strict Duty to the company.
As prosecutions relied on sections 10-b and 10-b(5) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, they were required to show fraud to make their case.
"It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by any means
or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of any
facility of any nation securities exchange,
(1) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,
(3) to engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates
or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,
in connection with the purchase or sale of any security."
(Rule 10b-5)
The misappropriation theory was largely intended to extend the reach of
courts to cover individuals who do not fall within the traditionally
prosecuted areas (the insider and the tipee [he who gets the tip] were
always the easiest to nail).  Consider the comments of Professor Barbara
Aldave (a regular commentator on insider trading):  "Without the aid of
the misappropriation theory, section 10(b) and rule 10b-5 would lose much
of their efficacy as weapons against insider trading on nonpublic
information since they would no longer extend to trading by 'outsiders.'"
The theory which founded insider trading law before the dawn of
misappropriation was the so called "disclose or abstain" rule.  i.e., if
you had material nonpublic information by reason of your employment you
had a choice.  You could disclose that information and then trade on it,
or abstain from trading.  (Chiarella and Dirks estlablished this line of
Again, courts have been forced to use the concept of fraud in connection
with "the purchase or sale of securities" to find liability.  When judges
saw what they considered illegal behavior by outsiders, the
misappropriation theory (that the information had been misappropriated and
that therefore the fraud needed to find liability could be found as
between the outside trader and the company) provided an easy out for
liability.  It was, in my view, a stretch to begin with.
See Generally, Barbara Bader Aldave, The Misappropriateion Theory:
Carpenter and Its Aftermath, 49 Ohio St. L. J. 373 (1988).
What is not mentioned here is that the 4th Circiut recently made a similar
Who cares if there's a pattern?  Notice no one here has bothered to try
and make the argument that insider trading harms anyone.
Now that the 8th and the 4th Circuits are in conflict with the remainder
it is likely that we will soon see a Supreme Court case on the topic.
It should be noted that in one of the decisions, (I can't recall which at
the moment) the insider trading charges were dismissed, but related wire
and mail fraud charges stood.  Wire and mail fraud have always, in my
view, represented a superior means to prosecute insider trading because
they force the prosecution to point to fraud with much more clarity than
modern 10b and 10b-5 theory required.

Pressure from the FTC Which fielded hundreds of complaints about Lexis and
the social security number scrap) has prompted members of the Banking
Committee to add provisions to the most recent spending bills which
protect personal information (including social security numbers, phone
numbers, addresses, and so forth) under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
This limits access to this information to credit agencies and otherwise
authorized entities.  (Of which I assume Lexis is not one).
It's not great protection, but it's something.
I urge everyone to take their own measures to protect personal data
regardless of what some piece of paper on a library shelf says is
protected.  The only real protection is not to allow release of the data
in the first place.

@_subject: reputation, e.g. www.ffly.com (was: Not reputation again! (Was: The Nature of the Cypherpunks List) ) 
This is incorrect.
Firefly actually looks at what you have recommended and then finds others
who have recommended or favor the same songs/albums/groups and selects new
groups albums or songs based on the number of people who agree with your
recommendations who suggest them.
i.e. if you give the eagles a 5 out of 5, and 20 others also gave the
eagles high ratings, the system weeds out what other groups those 20 gave
high ratings to and suggests them to you.  As you confirm or deny your
interest in those groups, the system narrows it down even more, using
those choices to find others who seem to have similar tastes to you and
suggesting albums and groups not yet in your file which have been
recommended by those with tastes like yours.
This trancends genres.  It's quite a nice system.
It also makes an important point about reputations.  Using a catagory
reputation scale is, as the author above describes, not very efficient.

@_subject: Insider Trading - What constitutes "Disclosure" ? 
This is not legal advice.  You got it for free.
Often the choice faced by the investor who has material non-public
information is characterized as "disclose or abstain," meaning that the
investor may either trade after disclosing or abstain from trading on the
A few people have asked me what constitutes disclosure.
I've not researched the latest cases, but the generally accepted "best
description" can be found in SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulpher Co., 401 F.2d 833
(2d Cir.1968), cert. denied.
As to the defense's claim that their purchases of stock were not
proscribed because the news had effectively been disclosed, the court
offered:  (errors mine)
Crawford (defendant) telephoned his orders to his Chicago broker about
midnight on April 15 and again at 8:30 in the morning of the 16th, with
instructions to buy at the opening of the Midwest Stock Exchange.  The
trial court's finding that "he sought to, and did, 'beat the news,' 258
F.Supp. at 287, is well documented by the record..  The rumors of a major
ore strike which had been circulated in Canada and , to a lesser extent,
in New York, had been disclaimed by the TGS press release of April 12,
which significantly promised the public an official detailed announcement
when possibilities had ripened into actualities.  The abbreviated
announcement to the Canadian press at 9:40 A.M. on the 16th by the Ontario
Minister of Mines and the report carried by the Northern Miner, parts of
which had sporadically reached New York on the morning of the 16th through
reports from Canadian affiliates to a few New York investment firms, are
assuredly not the equivalent of the official 10-15 minute announcement
which was not released to teh American financial press until after 10:00
AM.  Crawford's orders had been placed before that.  **Before insiders may
act upon material information, such information must have been effectively
disclosed in a manner sufficient to insure its availability to the
investing public.**  Particularly here, whre a formal announcement to the
entire financial news media had been promised in a prior official release
known to the media, all insider activity must await dissemination of the
promised official announcement.
Coates was absolved by the court below because his telephone order was
placed shortly before 10:20 AM on April 16, which was after the
announcement had been made public even though the news could not be
considered already a matter of public information.  258 F.Supp at 288.
This result seems to have been predicated upon a misinterpretation of
dicta in Cady, Roberts, where the SEC instructed insiders to "keep out of
the market until the estlablished procedures for public release of the
information are carried out instead of hastening to execute transactions
in advance of, and in frustration of, the objectives of the release," 40
S.E.C. at 915.  The reading of a news release, which promoted Coates into
action, is merely the first step in the process of dissemination required
for compliance with the regulatory objective of providing all investors
with an equal opportuinity to make informed investment judgements.
Assuming that the contents of the official release could have been
instantaneously be acted upon, at the minimum Coates should have waited
until the news could reasonably have been expcted to appear over the media
of widest circulation, the Dow Jones broad tape, rather than hastening to
insure an advantage to himself and his broker son-in-law.

@_subject: ABA Conference on Law Enforcement and Intelligence - Debrief 
The American Bar Association Standing Committee on Law and National Security - Law Enforcement and Intelligence Conference - The ABA's Standing Committee on Law and National Security is one of the more successful Committees to come out of the ABA.  It's conferences and early morning breakfast briefings and lectures are attended by some of the leading experts in the fields of National Security, Law Enforcement, and Intelligence and no small number of the beltway power elite.
I'm not sure if many people outside the legal community understand the degree to which attorney's have impacted and thrived in both the law enforcement and the intelligence communities.  In fact many, if not most, CIA case officers and station chiefs, as well as field operatives, are attorneys or have law degrees.  Other intelligence organizations are no different.  It should come as little surprise then if a committee of the ABA should happen to attract a surprising amount of intelligence professionals.
This conference was no exception.  Spooks, Feds, Legislators, and even a few Kooks were in attendance.  Members of the British, American, Canadian, and German intelligence communities were in attendance.  A colleague and I attended the majority of the conference and except where noted the reflections below are a summary of our collective notes and thoughts on the subject matter discussed.  I'm taking a broad view of relevance to cypherpunks, but I will omit that which seems clearly not of direct or somewhat indirect interest.
Part One:
A Changed World for Law Enforcement and Intelligence in the 21st Thursday, September 19
7:45 AM  Registration and Continental Breakfast
8:15 AM  Welcome Remarks
Paul Schott Stevens
ABA Standing Committee on Law and National Security
8:30 AM  I.  An Overview of a Changing World.
*The Traditional Relationship of Law Enforcement, Foreign Intelligence and National Security (1945-1995):
*How Have Other nations Balanced Legal and National Security Requirements and Responded to a Changed World.
*The Changed Threats to U.S. National Security- New Problems and Elizabeth R. Rindskopf
Bryan Cave
Former General Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency
Member, Standing Committee on Law and National Security
Ms. Rindskopf outlined the three classic "periods" of intelligence community and mission development in U.S. history and set the stage for the discussions to follow.
Interesting subjects she did touch on included section 715 of the Senate intelligence bill.  The section allows the law enforcement community to request assistance from foreign intelligence in collection efforts on foreigners outside of the United States.
The BNC and BCCI scandals were discussed as a backdrop of the hazards of law enforcement and intelligence separation.
Zoe Baird
Senior Vice President and General Counsel
Atena Life and Casualty Company
Member, Standing Committee on Law and National Security.
Ms. Baird discussed the dangers presented by globalization and new technologies.  She highlighted the point that crime globalization often follows corporate globalization and the manner in which a single individual's ability to cause harm has increased in scope (The NYNEX Hack).  Also interesting was her discussion of the manner in which the more organized elements of criminal activity worked to take advantage of the very open society in the United States (Fund raising, publications, anonymous communications).
Those activities once merely violations of criminal law are, she argued, now increasingly national security concerns and that national security events impact elections in very dramatic and direct ways (Atlanta and Israel bombings as examples).
Crime, she pointed out, gets about an 80% response in the polls, where as "National Security and Foreign Policy" get perhaps a 3% response.  Merging these elements together serves an administration.  She also pointed out the trend toward making these issues generally more accessible to the public.  (Specifically by use of language.  "Transnational threats"- which was a term of art for non-state terrorism and organized crime- becomes "Global Crime" or "Global Lawlessness."
Ms. Baird ended by asking how the firewalls between Law Enforcement and Intelligence could be rebuilt with these new considerations in mind.
I considered her a balanced cynic.  She managed to get across some very realpolitik notions without much murmuring from the (limited) civil libertarian crowd.
David Bickford
Former Legal Adviser to the British Intelligence Services (MI5-
Mr. Bickford has in past served as a conduit between British Intelligence services and the United States.  He is well known and respected among the American and European Intelligence communities.  Knowing Mr. Bickford I can also say that he pays a great deal of attention to who his audience is and speaks to their interests with disarming accuracy.  His discussion is important because it is a good insight into what the policy makers in the United States are looking at.
He began by highlighting the new international nature of crime.  No longer is it confined to power blocs.  "Multi-jurisdictional illegality" is increasingly a concern.  New highspeed communications channels are a contributor and organized crime groups are possessed of extremely advanced administration abilities.  They are leaner and meaner because they use computers, encryption, communications, and use up less resources in administration.  The ability to make the organization smaller also makes it harder to penetrate.  In this environment, international cooperation is essential.  He called for more active and expansive extraterritorial jurisdiction for certain crimes, and lamented his own country's lack of enthusiasm for this concept though they are slowly "coming around."
His solutions included the labeling of organizations, even when they are not geographically based, as "illegal international organizations" and using all means to combat them.  He envisions a wide cooperation by the G7 to accomplish this, leaving such organizations with no safe haven.  Sanctions regimes formerly employed only as against "rogue states" and countries in disfavor should be employed to destroy these illegal international organizations wherever they are.  He indicated that the other G7 states should build on the recent Clinton Executive Order which seizes the assets of such organizations which may be located in the jurisdictions of the G7.  He called for measures to deny these assets access to the major securities and international finance markets and proposed that only organizations like the NSA could confront and complete these tasks.  Intelligence, he argued, is the only organization that can keep up with international crime and as a result there should be developed court processes to introduce intelligence into criminal cases while protecting the more sensitive information (sources and methods) as irrelevant.  "Evil men" have taken an "early lead."
$500 billion a year comes out of the United States alone in money laundering.  400 billion in assets is attributed to drug cartels, 80% of which are Cali Cartel assets.  There are over 250 international Russian criminal organizations currently operating.
Mr. Phillip Heymann
James Barr Ames Professor and Director,
Center for Criminal Justice
Harvard Law School
Member: Standing Committee on Law and National Security
[Didn't find his comments particularly relevant]
II. Political Challenges in the World Environment
*Breakup of the U.S.S.R.
*Loss of National Sovereignty and Control by Nation States
*Erosion of National Legal Systems
Military Threats at the Subnational Level:
The Terrorism Dilemma
(This looked very much like the section given to the Soviet Analysts, who no longer have much of a job to do).
Mr. Morton H. Halperin
Senior Fellow
Council on Foreign Relations
Former Special Assistant to the President and
Senior Director for Democracy, National Security Council
Mr. Peter Rodman
Director, National Security Programs
Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom
and Former Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs
Mr. Rodman discussed the new "trans-national areas."  Terrorism, corruption, economic and criminal activity.  He discussed the side effects of collapsing empires (the rise of organized crime to enforce property and contract rights that cannot be enforced by the government, the shift of power to the local from the regional and executive areas) and discussed, in this context, the importance of avoiding petty squabbles over issues like trade and the like because they threaten the more important strategic cooperation that will be necessary to battle global and transnational criminal activity.
Ms. Jessica E. Stern
Lawrence Livermore National Laboraory and
Former Director, Russian, Uklrainian and Eursian Affairs,
National Security Council
Ms. Stern discussed the severe proliferation problems presented by a weak Russia, particularly the weakening of MPCA (Material Protection Control and Accounting).
11:15 AM  III.  Technical and Practical Changes in the Relevant World Environment
*Global Technologies Emerge
*"Equal Access" to Advanced Technology by State and Private * Change in Size, Type and Location of National Security Threats: Challenge for Modern Intelligence and Law Enforcement
Stewart Baker
Steptoe and Johnson
Former General Counsel, National Security Agency
Member, Standing Committee on Law and National Security
Mr. Baker's remarks were brief, but he discussed the evening of the odds with respect to government and private organizations caused by technology.
Admiral William O. Studeman
United States Navy (retired)
Former Acting Director of Central Intelligence
Admiral Studeman discussed "Information Warfare," pointing out specifically that advanced societies were more vulnerable because of their financial, banking and revenue system's dependence on computer.  Power, air traffic control, public safety and media were also mentioned in passing.
Admiral Studeman went on to call for more intense secrecy in law enforcement (not intelligence) as to collection methods and new technology.  He called passionately for funding for the DigiTel program as well as a "key escrow" policy.
Anthony Oettiger
Chairman, Program on Information Resources Policy
Harvard University
Mr. Oettinger was perhaps the only moderate speaker in the conference.  He discussed Executive Order 13010 (establishing the Critical Infrastructure Protection organization) and called for more private sector input in policy making (Banks, markets, businesses want to make their own security arrangements, and are not very interested in paying much attention to the suits at their door who claim 'Hi, we're from the government, we are here to help..'
He pointed out the difference between the movements in Airline Security (which is drifting from privately maintained, to publicly maintained).and Internet security (which is doing the He called for reasoned response to the new threats which did not commit expensive intelligence and law enforcement resources to combat the single hacker.  Proper threat assessing is important, and intelligence should be used to pinpoint the weak points.
Walter Pincus
National Security Affairs Reporter
The Washington Post
Mr. Pincus asked if (a lovely analogy to chicken little and osterages with their heads in the sand).  His most interesting remarks regarded the wisdom of dedicating such substantial resources to repell non-strategic efforts to disrupt networks.  (Hackers, lone gunmen, etc.)  He questioned.  Doesn't, afterall, a strategic attack require much more preperation?  Should we really allow the personality of e.g., Louis Freeh, who has the capital dazzled from his glow, to direct these resources?

John Deutch
Director, Central Intelligence Agency
[Cancelled in the wake of the investigation into alleged CIA drug connections in California]

The Implications of a Changed World for a Set of Critical 2:00 PM  IV.  Protections Against New High Tech Dangers; Problems of Encryption, Information Warfare and Computer Theft

@_subject: "Confessing to a felony" 
Mr. May is absolutely correct.  But let me discuss why I still think it's
Interest by law enforcement is impossible to predict.  It can be driven by
politial winds, and by fancy as well as unlucky coincidence.  (The drug
dealer who is busted because the police respond to a fight 911 call at the
wrong address).  The law is not fair in this regard.  Prosecution is
always selective and all one needs is an administration decision (even by
some mid-level idiot at justice) and suddenly crypto export could be a
serious issue.
In the case of the export at hand, a passport record exists, and surely
the notebook exists.  Were I a prosecutor with a bug in my rectum, I would
think I had something of a case.
This has never had anything to do with prosecution.  I wish it did.
There was once a day where confessing to sexual harassment or smoking something fishy would have caused this response.  Today it is grounds for
immediate dismissal.
Unfortunately these kind of exceptions are easily evaded when push comes
to shove.
If this is true, it is for two reasons.
1>  Because no one has yet told them to care.
2>  Because they find the regulation to difficult to enforce.
Start admitting that you have engaged in the conduct and those two factors
may quickly vanish.
Am I being cautious?  Of course.  Once upon a time it was ok to admit that
you left the country with tens of thousands in cash too.

@_subject: ssh - How widely used? 
Does anyone know if there are MS-Dos or Mac versions of the ssh client?
How much is ssh used?
I've not seen much discussion of it but poking around an ISP yielded this:
       Ssh  (Secure  Shell)  a  program for logging into a remote
       machine and for executing commands in  a  remote  machine.
       It  is  intended  to  replace  rlogin and rsh, and provide
       secure  encrypted  communications  between  two  untrusted
       hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and arbi-
       trary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over  the  secure
       channel.
Usage: ssh [options] host [command]
  -l user     Log in using this user name.
  -n          Redirect input from /dev/null.
  -a          Disable authentication agent forwarding.
  -x          Disable X11 connection forwarding.
  -i file     Identity for RSA authentication (default: ~/.ssh/identity).
  -t          Tty; allocate a tty even if command is given.
  -v          Verbose; display verbose debugging messages.
  -q          Quiet; don't display any warning messages.
  -f          Fork into background after authentication.
  -e char     Set escape character; ``none'' = disable (default: ~).
  -c cipher   Select encryption algorithm: ``idea'' (default, secure),
              ``des'', ``3des'', ``tss'', ``arcfour'' (fast, suitable for
              transfers), ``none'' (no encryption - for debugging only).
  -p port     Connect to this port.  Server must be on the same port.
  -L listen-port:host:port   Forward local port to remote address
  -R listen-port:host:port   Forward remote port to local address
              These cause ssh to listen for connections on a port, and
              forward them to the other side by connecting to host:port.
  -C          Enable compression.
  -o 'option' Process the option as if it was read from a configuration
Looks like a nice little implementation.

His admission that he used the notebook.  Recovering the notebook and
finding the software.  Interviewing the Customs agent working at the time.
Considering the headaches required for airline travel today, it's not like
there aren't serious records abound.
For crying outloud, he admitted to the world that he took the software
out.  I put that in front of a jury and it looks just like the typical
stupid bragging criminal.  Any defense about "I was just kidding" or "The
message was forged" might be interesting, but it will sound like
technical-mumbo-jumbo to a jury.  Yes, it would convince >ME< that was a
reasonable doubt, but a jury is very unlikely to buy it.  Juries almost
never buy things they don't understand.  Technical talk makes them sleepy.

As a former Fairfax resident I can tell you that the reason the school
preforms so well is because of the immense income from local property
taxes, and because the Fairfax school system has taken great pains to
maintain autonomy and freedom from the public school system at large.
They have managed, quite effectively, to create a private school that
receives public funds and keeps out interlopers.  They have my admiration
for this task.
I can also point out that everyone in the Greater D.C. area is trying to
get their kids into the various Fairfax schools.  Some resort to lying to
the DMV about their address to do so.  It is a measure of the clout of the
Fairfax school system that a few complaints have triggered a crackdown on
district monitoring which (surprise surprise) is concentrated in Fairfax.

measure for anything from money laundering prevention to capital
preservation.  In reality about all it does is make it harder to do
business with and in said economies.  It may be used, in the more
draconian states, to seperate treatment of those engaged in foreign
commerce from those not involved in international transactions (read rich

@_subject: SSL weakness affecting links from pa 
Thanks for the chance to address the issue.
I think that perfectly reasonable "features" often can become "security
flaws" or "privacy lapses" when the user is not aware of the potential
danger.  In this case I think much of the flak over the referer header is
driven by the fact that no one really appreciated the danger until it was
pointed out.  This gives rise to the "My god!  What have I been giving out
all these months while accessing  panic.  Of course
the next step is anger.  "Why the hell does  do that?  Why
wasn't I told?"
This melds into another software annoyance of mine.  Sacrificing the needs
of the user who knows what he is doing for the novice when both can be
easily satisified.  Of course the reverse is also true.  Take, for
example, Mr. Stewart's comment:
Well, those of us who know what we are doing should know better but (and
I'm not sure this is Mr. Weinstein's mission or concern) if you want to
educate the public you need to assume the user does not know and create
and option to streamline operation for the user who does.
Having said the above, what I would like to see is an option to surpress
the referer header explicitly like with cookies.
"You are about to forward a referer header to the page you have selected.
Forwarding the referer header to this site may reveal more about your web
browsing habits than you would prefer.  Should  surpress the
referer header?  Yes/No/Always Surpress/Never Surpress."
I might add that I would like an option on cookie supression to bypass
that annoying dialog such to never allow cookies.  It gets a bit much when
a page askes for 9 cookies in a row and the only way to prevent them is to
get beeped at repeatedly.  Again, don't confuse the novice, don't slow
down the expert.

@_subject: Useful utility? 
I've been hearing a lot of complaints from sysadmins who I try to convince
to run SSH lately.
"Key management is too difficult."
"I cant keep track of all that stuff."
I think that an interesting answer might be a ssh key issuing "robot." or
vending machine of sorts.
It might works something like this.
User wants access to the sshd running host.
Sysadmin gives the user a one time key only good for connecting to the
vending machine via SSH.  Would be nice if the robot recycled the password
every time a successful connection was made.
Connecting to the vending machine, the user would fill out a form
including the hostnames he was likely to connect from and etc.
After filling out that form, the user would be issued a key for the
system, which would be automatically entered into authorized_keys.
Whatever other automation was needed to get a user up and running on SSH
would be executed.
Of course, the main problem is that the sysadmin could capture the secret
key of the user and use it to create a false login trail or other
mischief.  This could be avoided by allowing a user generated key to be
submitted, of course.  Ideally both options would be presented with a
"less secure" warning for the former.
Might make a nice project for someone fluent in perl, or even a webpage.
I'd do it my self if my programming talents were not so pathetic.

enhanced with a "victim was infirm or helpless" or a "firearm was used in
furtherance of the crime" could as easily reflect a lack of vigor and
spite in the prosecution of bank fraud as it could reflect severe vigor  and spite in the prosecution of theft.
Please note that the difference between:
"But he got the same sentence as he would have if he was convicted of carrying a gun in furtherance of the crime."
"But he got the same sentence as he would have is he was not convicted of
carrying a gun in furtherance of the crime."
is subtle at best.
Next time don't get caught stealing with a gun nearby.

A specific statement of what constitutes "flames, insults" and etc. might
be a good idea.
How will borderline posts be dealt with?  Posts that contain a great deal
of content and thoughful discussion and still manage to contain flames?
Will flames be an automatic boot for a post (zero tolerance), or will they
be balanced against post content?
What is the threshold which, for example, constitutes an "insult" ?
"Louis Freeh couldn't identify a directed well managed crypto policy if it
bit him on his pimple speckled ass."
"You are so turned around on this issue one is prompted to wonder if you
have any background in higher education at all."
"For the new members of the list, [insert list member here] has a history
of posting idiotic and useless posts, and generally wasting the list's
time like an asshole."
All of the above?  None of the above?
Excellent idea.
I believe the "flames" list should be maintained as long as possible.
Continuing checks on the moderator (whoever it may be) are necessary and
appropriate.  What better way than to directly provide a means to identify
what the moderator has excluded?
(Also, if the flames and non flames lists are maintained, how is this more
bandwidth than the former condition where both flames and nonflames will
posted together?  In fact, if this has a deterant effect on flames (one of
the main reasons for instituting the policy) the bandwidth should be less.
Its only more bandwidth if the unmoderated list is maintained.
Perhaps the unmoderated list should be eliminated, as subscribing to both
the flames and the non-flames will have the same net effect...?
A diversity of moderators makes a detailed stated policy on moderation an
absolute must.
Excellent until the flames list is eliminated.

Not to my knowledge.  But See, subpoena comment above.
I am amazed that no one has suggested a pool of moderators with
provisions to blind a given post from attributation to a specific
moderator.  (Attornies- what might be impact of a Res Ipsa attack on this
kind of set up, and incidently, on other anonymous pool arrangements?)
While as far as conduct goes I agree, in defining what will eventually be
the list content, and thus what I should or should not use/waste my time
typing up, it is an important ex ante condition that a stated policy
exist.  There are two questions here.
1>  Will my material be booted off only because it disturbs the moderator?
(I think this is the one answered by your common law reference)
2>  Will my material violate some restriction and be booted "for cause?"
(This can only be predicted accurately if there is a stated policy on what
constitutes a violation- and then only where the policy has teeth or is
generally respected).

@_subject: If guilty of a lesser crime, you can be sentenced for a greater 
Basically correct.  Lesser included offenses are seperate offenses.
Robbery, as a very mundane example, is a combination of larceny and
assault. If the assault charge cannot be proven, robbery cannot be proven,
but larceny still can independently.
Sentencing enhancements:
There is a big book called the Federal Sentencing Guidelines Handbook (or
some such).  To arrive at the appropriate sentence range, you add up the
points of all the offenses the defendant was convicted of (Assume Bank
Fraud is 18 points, Murder 35 or whatever- I dont remember them offhand)
and run across a chart which has "criminal history catagory" on the
vertical axis.  Where the two meet gives you the sentence range.  I'm not
near my office right now, but if there is enough interest I will dig up
the current handbook and run a sample sentencing through.
The most common one I see is "Victims helpless or infirm" which usually
boosts 2 to 5 points.
Sentencing enhancements are not double jeapordy either.  I don't see how
you can argue they are.  For example, there is a provision in bank fraud
sentencing guidelines which enhances the sentence according to the size of
the loss, and I believe there is a kicker if the financial institution
I believe the highest base offense level was "Espionage" or some such.
There are also sentencing limiters.  "Defendant displays clear remorse."
I think is one.
Go out to a law book store and take a look at the guideline book.  It's
actually a lot of fun.  "Ok, say I killed my wife for her coke stash and
recruited my brother to dump the body..."
They need only be noted as a finding of fact by the jury.  (Or the judge
in other cases).
It's both a crime and an enhancement for most federal drug offenses.
Well, just about.  The sentencing enhancement might not be enough points
to kick the defendant into the next bracket.  It depends on how many base
offense points the defendant has before you start throwing in
enhancements.  The judge probably would have gotten a higher maximum from
the combined crime, but the jury has to find guilty of that offense.
Well, it can increase the maximum actually, because it actually adds
offense points.
Congress has already passed on the sentencing enhancements in most cases,
making them simply "versions" of crimes.
If you want to look at it a different way, if you are involved with a drug
offense and are not using a weapon, you'll get a lower sentence than a
full fledged drug crime.  It's a step in the right direction - i.e. away
from manadatory sentencing of a flat time period for a crime regardless of

This entire thread makes me want to suggest a set of guidelines for people
who are going to try and submit untested crypto software to the list so we
don't have to do this every 2 weeks.
In any event this is a good start.
I dont believe this is quite what you mean.
I think you are confusing two kinds of cyphers (public and otherwise) with
each other and attributing for the difference in key measurements
(actually caused by the different keyspace for prime number based
public key systems) by using bytes and bits.
This does not bode well for your crypto expertise, if in fact this is what
you are doing.
I dont really think anyone uses bytes to refer to key size, except perhaps
in Prime Number challenges (RSA-129).
How is this obvious?
I'm not sure DES 128 exists.
A simple entropy test does not a cypher make.  I'd also like to know what
patterns were tested for as certainly I know of no test which can prove
that a given set of data does not have "*any* repeating patterns."
Entropy is subjective.  Perhaps it encodes stuff in Estonian.  There may
not be recognizeable patterns in english, but there certainly will be
patterns.  Perhaps its output exactly mimics the radiowave noise from
Alpha Centauri between 10pm and 10:00.0056pm January 1.  You can't show me
it doesn't, and if you could I could just invent a new pattern to get you
to test.  (How many angels....)
Can't prove a negative (there are no patterns in here).
Your cypher has obviously undergone a lot of work.  This too does not a
cypher make.  Nor does your hype.  That usually a cypher unmakes, in fact.
My suggestion:  Full disclosure on your cypher coupled with a reduction in
the sales and marketing rhetoric that we are getting from you.  (You might
try a non AOL address too, adds a bit more respectability).

[The fork in the road is discussed]
Yes.  One of the major stumbling blocks I have run into is a lack of code
which really is refined and reviewed enough to serve the purposes I need
it to serve.  FC97 did a lot to make some more obscure things obvious, and
familiarize the players with each other, but the details are often hard to
come by.  Many of the applications out there are painfully behind in
interface areas forcing developers to use complicated "toolkits" which
often lack the basics we need. Finding an analogy to easily explain even
the basics to a customer is very difficult unless the front end jibes with
the attempt.
The amount of confusion over what represents a good algorithm is also
interesting.  Take CAST, which seems a promising cipher and which we
considered using over IDEA.
On asking 4 "experts" about CAST, I got 4 answers.
1>  A 64 bit cipher with 40 bits secret.
2>  A 64 bit cipher - not expected to be very complete.
3>  A 128 bit cipher.
4>  "Not worth discussing."
In fact, as I understand it, CAST is of variable key length (Up to 128
bits), and quite resistant to many attacks which plague DES and even IDEA.
But digging out that information was painfully difficult.  (It may not
even be correct).
Most of what concerns me is the need to keep keylengths "obscenely large"
because what is obscene today may not be so obscene after 5 years of
chilled crypto development.
Given the success (or lack thereof) of my call to arms before, I'm not
sure I'll be anxious to repeat it soon.  (The largest keylength of any
widely used cipher of which I am aware remains at 128.  There still is no
effective PipeNet, no real mainstream "stealth crypto."  No significant
work on detering traffic analysis or denial of service with the exception
of the below).
Hearty kudos.
An online bank is useless if it can be blocked by a few keystrokes.
(But that's what secure INMARSAT phones are for too)
Still, these are areas that I wish c'punks would start looking at again.
Even if strong unforfeited crypto is legal in the U.S., it will not be in
other countries for quite some time.
There is strength in numbers, not just safety.  The more crypto users
there are, the less government, or anyone else, can do about it.
C'punks should wish to provide clandestine crypto services for the entire
population.  Laws which may or may not pass in the United States should
bore c'punks, because they should realize that legislation is irrelevent
because the genie is already out of the bottle.  Unfortunately, I don't
think the genie is all the way out of the bottle.

As I recall, 3des ( DESk1 -> DESk2^-1 -> DESk3 ) has an effective
keylength of 112 bits.  Less than IDEA.  Schneier discusses this.
I dislike this line of argument for several reasons.  It reduces security
to the lowest common denominator.  Because, the argument goes, few people will use more than a 21 character passphrase, then we need not design
anything with more security.
In reality, I think that the percentage of people who use more than an 8
character passphrase, especially outside these circles, is small.
Following your logic, our high end of security should be about 48 bits.
Again, you have taken an important concept, total security, and reversed
it.  Instead of aiming to make each link as strong as possible, you have
aimed to design around the weakest link.
This is a serious mistake in my view.
It costs little today to develop a cipher with larger keyspace.  (DES with
independent subkeys already exists and has a basic keyspace of 768 bits.
A meet in the middle attack reduces keyspace to 2^384.  Schneier discusses
the cipher briefly).  If users are willing to deal with large keys (I
certainly am) then software designers are restraining a more secure
I think most will agree that anything over 150 bits makes brute force
a losing effort.  Unfortunately it has to be deployed first.

I conceed this general point, but in context it does not stand up.
Specifically we were referring to the trade off between cipher keylength
and password size.
It was proposed that because people were unlikely to deal with passwords
large enough to fill the key with e.g., 128 bits of entropy, that it was
worthless to bother with 128 bit symetric ciphers.  I find this a hard
position to support.
Ok, where are the 256+ bit blowfish implementations?

Money Laundering law netting more small fry.
Prosecutors putting new tool to work.
A sentencing weapon Congress intended for use against drug lords is being
wielded against other defendants.  Judges and others say this has
diminished legal fairness.
By Jan Crawford Greenburg
Washington Bureau
Washington-  Jose Caba considered himself a hardworking, law-abiding man,
and immigrant who built a business selling groceries in a poor Brooklyn
But when he started illegally redeeming food stamps and depositing the
proceeds into a bank account, prosecutors thought otherwise.  They accused
him of money laundering and sought a harsh sentence.
Caba, who thought he was only bending administrative rules, isn't the kind
of criminal Congress had in mind when it decided to give prosecutors a
weapon to bring down powerful drug lords.  Nevertheless, he is one of a
growing number of defendants who commit routine fraud and find themselves
facing big-time charges of money laundering.
More and more prosecutors are invoking [money laundering statutes] in
simple fraud, bribery and embezzlement cases, a trend that doesn't sit well
with many federal judges or the U.S. Sentencing Commission.
In a strongly worded report, the commission... is recommending that the
sentences for money laundering be reworked.  The penalties are unfair, the
commission said, because they often vastly exceed the seriousness of the
Caba would have faced 2 to 2 1/2 years in prison for food stamp fraud, but
because he deposited the funds in a bank- thereby meeting the definition of
laundering the money- he was looking at 10 to 12 years.
Nationally, statistics show a marked increase in money laundering cases.
In 1995 prosecutors charged 1700 people with money laundering, up from 250
in 1990.  More than half of the defendants charged in 1995 were involved in
non-drug related crimes.
Critics say the charged is used even more than the figures show because
prosecutors threaten defendants with the charge to get them to plead guilty
to the underlying crime.
"It has tremendous implications in the criminal justice system because
prosecutors can use it as a tremendous bargaining stick..." said Gordon
Greenberg, a defense attorney and an expert on money laundering.  "Every
single crime, theoretically, can be converted into money laundering because
the statute is that broad."
What's more, prosecutors in some areas routinely file the charge, while
others decline to do so.  As a result, "proportionality is lost and
appropriate uniformity is lost," said Jonathan Wroblewski, director of
legislative and public affairs for the sentencing commission.
[] stiff sentences also apply to defendants who make no attempt to cover up
their proceeds.  Caba laundered money by depositing it into a bank, even
though his deposits were by check and he paid taxes on his proceeds.
"For all intents and purposes, if you use your ill-gotten gains, it's money
laundering." said Alan Chaset, a lawyer who chairs the American Bar
Association's committee on sentencing guidelines.  "If you take money and
put it in a bank and then withdraw it and buy a stick of gum, it's money
Some judges refuse to impose the sentence in cases where there was no
elaborate scheme to conceal the money, such as a 1994 case in which
prosecutors charged a defendant with money laundering when he put cash from
drug sales into a shoe box. [...]

insists that no personal business of any kind is to be tolerated.  I doubt
such a firm would have a reasonable retention rate either.

of as dangerous by those kind of entities.
Blame law school.
If my position on this issue makes me some kind of troublemaker, you better
point the same finger at Schneier, who (if quoted accurately) shares my view.
I do.  Unimparied privacy for individuals in all contexts.  Now tell me how
PGP5.5 contributes to that cause, particularly in the current political
climate.  The timing looks extremely suspect to me.  Challenging the
premise that corporates own the flesh and mind of every employee within the
walls of their facilities doesn't really strike me as something
pro-estlablishment or bearing the hallmarks of some sinister plot, unless
perhaps one is on a law-enforcement or far right corporate-facist spectrum.
 P2, the italian corporate-facist movement, held similar views after the
second world war, so your ideas are not new.  My view is, however, that
this is the wrong way for the world to progress.  If beliving that
employees don't sell their souls to large corporations because they accept
their paychecks is evil, call me evil.  At the same time I beleve that
companies don't tell their soul to a given government just because they do
business on a given "soil."  This strikes me as consistant.  Perhaps you
will disagree.
If correcting legal errors, highlighting the flaws in basic premises and
pointing out general gaps in logic, which is what I think I've been doing
for the many years I've been poking around on c'punks an elsewhere, is
disrupting and diverting, perhaps the "important discussions" are on the
wrong tact.
Glazing over the messy details of any policy, which seems to be what your
"disrupting and diverting some important discussion" clause is advocating,
is a rather sly tactic really.  "If all these privacy extremists would just
shut up about the details of our plan, we could get something done without
diversion and distraction."  Sound familiar?  Always look at those calling
for silence with suspicion.
Actually, I don't even usually proofread my stuff.  I'm pleased it gives
you the impression of some fine craftsmanship, or bears the indications of
some grand conspiracy, but in reality its off the top of my head.  The
consistancy you see is probably because I don't waiver in my principles
when it comes to privacy.
Clearly, any answer I deliver to this question only harms me.  I've seen
this trick before.
What kind of decoration?  Are you offering me one?  (Aside from "Snide
Asshole Lawyer of the Year" or something I mean).

What the (nameless) SPA keynote speaker said (on stage and off to the sides

Bottomline, the United States is probably going to get the administation

Mr. May said:
Of late I tried to pay off a rather large American Express bill.
Suddenly, AMEX won't take cash in excess of $1,000 in any single billing
period (30 days).  The large sign on the wall indicated the substance of
the new rule (or the old rule newly enforced) and added that customers "may
be required to produce two forms of identification including a government
issued identification card and a social security number."  Here's a
situation where the payor is (theoretically) positively identified to the
payee (including ssn), where credit has already been established, and where
records are certain to exist for all transactions which are being paid for.
 The AMEX Corporate card was once a wonderful tool to preserve anonymity
with.  One could issue several cards for a domestic company, 100% owned by
an offshore, and settle in cash.  Properly done, this was perfectly legal.
Well, once upon a time anyhow.
I find it extremely alarming that a general transaction like this can be
illegal where almost no case can be made for a danger of money laundering
or some kind of support of the "underground economy" (except perhaps that
I'd have Pablo Escobar pay off my Amex to compensate me for my illegal
smuggling flights, but that's a bit thin in my view).
Increasingly, I try and find explanations for these kinds of regulations
which do not include a paranoid rant about governments making sure they
maintain a firm set of records on every citizen for whenever it might be
"needed," (or wanted).  Increasingly, this becomes a difficult mental task.
Increasingly, it is difficult to make cash transactions.  In the end that
seems to be the point.  Make it difficult to pay with cash.  Make it
suspicious to pay with cash.  Make it an attention getter if you pay with
Sound paranoid?  Try this.  I'd like everyone who reads this to try and go
45 days without using plastic or writing a check.  Just 45 days.  If you
don't grow alarmist very quickly (like in the first week) I'd like to hear
your experience.  If nothing else, try adding up a few months of finance
charges, yearly fees on your credit cards, transactions fees, check fees,
interest lost on no-interest checking accounts... see what you're paying to
keep people from looking at you like a criminal.
There's an interesting new awakening in personal finance right now which
advises, among other things, "pay in cash, die broke."  I'm interested to
see how this "pay in cash" advice, which I have followed religiously years
before it was put in print, clashes with post-modern financial regulation.
I know things have gotten really out of hand because the phrase "No, I'll
pay with cash," which I find I have to use more and more often, turns more
and more heads and is met more and more often with a cross look from a
teller and a finger pointed at a large sign bearing the heading
"Restrictions on Cash Transactions."
When the question becomes "Which credit card will you be paying with?" and
no longer does one hear "How will you be paying for that?" I think people
better start thinking about what's happening.

@_subject: DBS, Privacy, Money Laundering nonsense. 
Ok let's work on them:
You miss the point entirely.  Thieves CAN hide the money they stole today.
It's not even particularly hard.  See my previous post for an idea of how
hard it is to detect a thief hiding his money.
And so...?
Classic logical flaw.  After the fact, therefore because of the fact.
High tech is available now that wasn't before
The rate of embezzlement is higher
therefore high tech is to blame.
Clearly, therefore:
Merlyn waved his hands
the moon passed before the sun
therefore Merlyn caused the moon to pass before the sun.
I'll wager the percentage of embezzlement in your area has increased in
rough proportion to the growth of the local economy.  Check for me and get
back to us.
You could hardly reduce the trackability of money anymore today.  A 500
million dollar fraud transferred through the world financial system hides in
about 20 trillion in funds which move every day.  That FinCEN actually can
detect crime via its network is a fantasy.  I've just been over the math
which demonstrates how difficult a task it really is.  Review it.  Crimes
are discovered and caught by good police work.  The fact that the
constitution makes "good police work" that much harder is a price to live
with in a free society.  Choose your poison.  Clearly technologies like
wiretaps and funds tracking are sold as investigatory tactics which result
in new cases being brought, but (at least in the case of money laundering)
this just isn't the case.  It's simply not supported by the numbers.  What
you don't hear today is how many cases get dropped because of lack of
evidence with plain ole banking today.  It's painfully easy to make money
Given that a police state has the lowest incidence of crime you need to make
a fundamental decision about what kind of world you want to live in.  A
story for your consideration in the meantime:
The AIDS rate in Cuba is a fraction of the AIDS rate in the rest of the
world.  This despite the fact that prostitution is rampant, and Cuba is a
third (even fourth) world country.  Why is this so?  Because Castro ordered
all HIV+ citizens into HIV camps and isolated them from the rest of the
population immediately, like "civilized" countries used to do with Scarlet
and Yellow fever before people infected with a life threatening disease
became a minority group worthy of political protection.
So is it worth the price?
Perhaps you view the threat of DBS as so significant that it requires
dramatic, even draconian measures to prevent its adoption.  Unfortunately,
you have painted yourself into a corner because DBS and cash are identical
except with respect to medium of exchange.
Then, by your argument, we should ban Cash as well.  What if I told you that
a new technology would allow armed robbers unprecedented mobility, the
ability to escape the scene of a crime in an instant, and provided them with
the ability to traverse long distances in making their escape while
protected from scrutiny.  What if this same technology gave them the means
to conceal from the view of any law enforcement the proceeds of their heist
and could make their path entirely untraceable to police?
Well, I suppose automobiles are going to have to go.
Again, there is no pressure on laundering today.  It's a trivial exercise.
Money laundering regulation has bred a cadre of professional launderers.
Even by the best numbers the authorities seize less than 0.006% of illicit
funds and spend 20000 times what they seize to seize it.
Vote with your feet.  (I don't really agree with this assessment, but
regardless, if you believe it, reduce your tax burden by expatriating).
Again, taxes in countries with less financial regulation (almost all of the
non-U.S. countries) are typically less, if not substantially less than in
the U.S.  How do you explain this if your point is true?
Again, then move.  I don't really care what DBS does to the government
sector.  I only care what it does to the costs of transactions.  I handle
the political and regulatory issues by moving.  (You might take John
Walker's example.  He bailed primarily to avoid the "bullshit factor" not
the tax).
Uh, all those conditions are present today.
Again, see above.
Again, vote with your feet.  I'm too busy for civil disobedience, voting in
sham elections, and the two party system.  Grass roots political activism
changes nothing in my experience.  Even if it did, I still just don't have
the time.  I prefer supporting political processes that are forward looking
and interested in DBS.  These do exist.
Which laws?  Those of the United States?  Well get cracking, the U.S. has
195 countries to invade, overthrow and pacify to harmonize foreign ideas
about how things should be done with the much more enlightened and effective
crime preventing methods prevailing in the United States today.  Stop
laughing, the integrity of the whole legal framework is at stake.
Actually, after some reflection I think that you're right.  Now if only we
could get all those blacks back in line we could get some real law and order
done.  How did we allow their civil disobedience to gain them anything?  Are
we going to _reward_ that kind of behavior?  It's a threat to the entire
system.  Now where did I put my sheets?
I see.  So DBS is going to be responsible for an increase in property and
violent crimes?  DBS will cause the poor to rise up because "Da Man" has
more power now?
Of course this is silliness of the highest degree.  The tendency to
overstate the power of DBS in here seems to be an affliction of both sides
now.  It's a technology, not a way of life.  Get over it.
I won't even comment on the need for yet more regulation other than to say
that healthcare in e.g. Switzerland is a fraction of the cost of health care
in e.g. the United States because physicians don't have to carry $10 million
dollars in liability insurance.
What's your solution to prevent the use of cash and international wire
transfers in large-scale financial fraud, political payoffs, etc.?  Or is
that outside your scope?
I'm telling you they already exist.  What are you going to do about it?
You're an accountant.  You should have answers for these things.
I think you might find that the cost of auditing is directly linked to the
likelihood of a civil suit against the auditors in the United States.
Address tort reform if you want to impact that.  You're a CPA, get cracking.
These aren't issues that are specific to DBS, they are endemic to the
current system
In the U.S. perhaps.  I'm not a resident there anymore so I could care less.
Any DBS system can be made to comply with country laws based on internet
address location or the front end dealer's compliance requirements.  The
underwriter in the system passes the responsibility for compliance to the
local issuer, which is as it should be.  What's the big deal?  You think a
global system has to comply with the highest level of regulation of any of
the participating actors...?  Of course that's nonsense.  The United States,
much as it might like to be, is not the final authority on world financial
regulation and is unlikely to be any time in the near future (thank god).
Opponents of DBS may raise all these arguments but they, and you, still have
not addressed the basic point that all these things are already possible
with cash.  Will they ban cash, and if so when and by what means?
I'm unconcerned about "legitimate forms of peer-to-peer electronic payments"
because I am unaware of any.  Even mondex isn't truly peer to peer.
The silliness quotient of this discussion exceeded my tolerance level after
the "evils of civil disobedience" discussion.  (I also don't read
cypherpunks anymore so I won't see replies not copied to me personally).

Mr. Hettinga comments:
crypto-amnesty someday?
Please.  Revoking one's citizenship, particularly for a better option- of
which there are many- is hardly the end of the world, and is unlikely to
make one a felon.  It will, in fact, prevent one from becoming one in this
case which is, of course, the point.  Using terms like "Crypto-amnesty" is
just inflammatory.
Mr. Hettinga further comments:
Of course, this is nonsense.  I know several major U.S. tax offenders who
have several million in liens and civil judgements who return to the United
States on a regular basis, they just don't maintain assets there.  Further,
one of them just recently renewed his U.S. passport at the U.S. consulate
without incident.
Bottom line:  People don't become criminals in the United States because
they leave it.  Consider the ramifications of turning people away at the
border because they are engaged in completely legitimate commercial
practices abroad which are, none the less, undesirable in the United
States?  Christ, the U.S. can't even turn away well known but unconvicted
French Economic Intelligence experts at the border.
I am constantly amused at the attitude of Americans who are convinced that
anyone who lives outside of the "end-all-be-all of the civilized world"
must live in some third world country.  This too is nonsense.  If I were
jurisdiction shopping I'm not sure I'd pick a small African nation, as some
others have, because this state would be extremely unlikely to protect me
from the kind of nastiness that nations are expected to protect citizens
from.  Also, visa-free travel is a pretty big consideration.  Picking a
country not well established in this regard is folly.
Cryptography is the cutting edge of many things, but that situation is
quickly wavering.  It's not long before being a cryptographer is even less
profitable than it is today.  If plying your trade is important, waiting
around for "market forces" to convince the FBI that they have it all wrong
is probably not a good strategy.
Incidentally, if anyone needs assistance contacting the best migration
consultants around, I'd be happy to give you my views and make referrals.
Some of you who want a counterpoint based on something a bit more
substantial than provincial fear mongering might ask after Tim May, who I
recall considered departing the United States but decided against it for a
variety of reasons.

I can't speak to your felonious activities, but on the other points, very
For spoliation as an independent cause of action in tort (not to mention the
criminal sanctions that can attach through obstruction) See: Bondu v. Gurvich,
473 So.2d 1307 (1985).  Medical malpractice case in which court rules that the
loss (not destruction) of medical records related to the claim constituted
spoliation of evidence.  (Note: no willful destruction was shown, mere
negligence and the records were "lost" by actions prior to the commencement of
the proceedings).  See also: Hirsch v. General Motors, 628 A.2d 1108 (1993).
Products liability case- vehicle caught fire, was refurbished, sold, then
"lost" to an unknown purchaser.  Only then did Plaintiffs file a suit against
General Motors and the dealer who sold them the car.  Court held the "loss" of
the car constituted spoliation of evidence.  (Note that no proceeding for
products liability had been pending when the car was resold).
See also generally: Brian E. Howard, Spoliation of Evidence, 49 J.Mo.B. 121
On the dangerous and insidious nature of Spoliation in civil cases Generally:
Mary A. Wells, Penalties for Spoliation of Evidence Can be Serious, Including
Exclusion of  Evidence, Adverse Inferences and Liability for an Independent
Tort, 60 Def.Couns.J.  280 (1993).
So long as it was regular practice and documented as policy it meant you had a
_defense_ against an action or spoliation issue.  It hardly meant that you
weren't potentially going to be found in contempt of court, subject to a civil
suit for spoliation or worse.  As I'm sure you are aware your argument is
flawed because of a sampling error.  i.e.: "I walked across the street today
and was not struck by an automobile.  Therefore I can always expect no
automobile will strike me when walking across the street."  This is clearly
not so.
IBM and Intel are also better resourced than our typical remailer operator.
(Unless you know something I don't?)  I think it's pretty easy to argue that
IBM and Intel were engaged in some naughtiness, that's not the issue.  The
issue is who is going to go after them and who wants to spend the money
against an IBM or Intel defense team.  (In fact you will probably know that in
the Intel anti-trust days there was a bit of naughtiness done and there is a
statute out there generated at least partly from Intel's conduct- specifically
a change was made to 18 USC 1505:
"Obstruction of proceedings before departments, agencies, and committees:
Whoever, with intent to avoid, evade, prevent, or obstruct compliance, in
whole or in part, with any civil investigative demand duly and properly made
under the Antitrust Civil Process Act, willfully withholds, misrepresents,
removes from any place, conceals, covers up, destroys, mutilates, alters, or
by other means falsifies any documentary material, answers to written
interrogatories, or oral testimony, which is the subject of such demand; or
attempts to do so or solicits another to do so... [blah blah blah...] shall be
fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both."
If you flesh out the case law on "intent," which I'll do some below, you'll
find that there is no requirement that the investigative proceeding or demand
have been made yet.
Intel and IBM aside, a remailer operator is hardly going to be doing him or
herself a favor looking to large multi-nationals to define the rules of
conduct since all of us here know (or should have known) that the rules don't
always (ever?) apply to large multi-nationals.Back to the matter at hand.In
reference to your example c.f. the experience in Willard v. Caterpillar, Inc.,
40 Cal.App.4th 892 (1995).  Defendant destroys all internal records on the
design for a tractor that eventually results in an injury and a lawsuit
(products liability), some ten (10) years later.  Defendant destroyed these
records _on advice of counsel_ 10 years before the proceedings and years
before the accident.  The trial court found spoliation in a hot minute,
imposed sanctions and referred to the prosecutor the suggestion that criminal
obstruction charges be filed.
If this were a remailer operator we'd be struggling to scrape together
$2,000.00 for EFF to defend the guy and he'd still be in the can, I suspect.
In a lovely piece of language on intent with reference to the destruction of
the documents the court also notes: "...intent is broader than a desire or
purpose to bring about physical results.  It extends not only to those
consequences which are desired, but also to those which the actor believes are
substantially certain to follow from what the actor does."  (More on this
later).  An expensive appeal overturned a portion of the sanctions, but _only_
it seems, because the judges were convinced that the action of destruction was
on advice of counsel and this outweighed the spoliation effect itself, which
was low since the probative value of the records destroyed were regarded by
the court to be minimal.
I'd counter that the bookstore would be running afoul of standard accounting
practices, or that most of the records of credit card transactions would be
otherwise available so it's not a very good hypo, but let's go with it.
I note that you have omitted my "knew or should have known" that those records
were likely to be part of a proceeding, I assume not just because it serves
your argument in this instance.  (I also note that the quote is "do not taunt
happy-fun-court."  A reference to the SNL quote "Do not taunt happy-fun-ball"
and a statement of the dangers of taunting powers you may not understand).
Still, the facts in Willard might still support your hypo as plausible, though
I find it hard to envision it being pressed, and I think if you look at the
facts of Hirsch v. General Motors you'll also find that the court isn't that
kind to an otherwise innocent third party who does anything with records or
"evidence" that eventually is sought after by the court, reasonability aside,
knowledge aside, pending litigation aside.
Disturbingly, innocent third parties have increasingly been taking it on the
chin in American jurisprudence, but that's another essay.
And I stand by those.  Such people have no (or just a little depending on the
age of the judge in the case) defense in "normal course of business" or
"custom" or "policy" that their actions were for any purpose other than to
dispose of potentially material evidence to a crime.  Face facts.  Remailers
are to destroy or prevent the creation of records.  It's pretty reasonable to
assume that the operator knows about this effect and anticipates the result.
(More on that in a sec).  Let's pretend for sake of argument that we could
make a normal course of business argument (which IBM and Intel certainly would
make, citing document destruction policies broadly written but loosely
applied, to demonstrate their intent as being kosher).  Even this isn't always
enough, but it tends to help, particularly if your a big company keeping lots
of records.  (See e.g., Willard, Hirsch).  Also, note the intent
interpretation, applied to spoliation, is articulated better in Lopez v.
Surchia 112 Cal.App.2d 314.  A person who acts willfully intends "those
consequences which (a) represent the very purpose for which an act is done
(regardless of the likelihood of occurrence), or (b) are known to be
substantially certain to result (regardless of desire)."  On this point See
Also Generally: Perkins on Criminal Law (2d ed.).
Taking it to the remailer example, sure, your (a) very purpose for which [logs
are routinely erased] is accomplished. to wit: the saving of space time etc.
but it is also (b) known to be substantially certain to result in [the denial
of a court of law's access to the records pertaining to an issue before it].
Let's face it, remailers are not politically correct animals (all the human
rights and recovery group arguments notwithstanding).  A court might well
assign intent to a remailer operator on the basis of this piece of case law,
which is _strongly_ engrained in California jurisprudence incidentally and
used as a major cite in several intent issue arguments.
In response I can only direct you to read above.
This is the point.  The practical definition of destruction of evidence is
what the court says it is.  All you can do, all you can ever do, in court is
to make arguments the other way.  Either the court will buy them, or they
won't.  I tend to think your bookstore example would be unlikely to bring
about a case.  However, if I walked into the bookstore, told the manager I was
going to sue him because he was overcharging 2% for every book, and then left,
_technically_ the destruction of billing records after that point makes a
pretty good case for spoliation.
Something I didn't even give thought to, that I discovered thanks to Mr. May's
insistence that I provide cites, is that it's even worse than that.  You don't
even have to intentionally toss the records to be spoiling evidence.  You can
do it by mere negligence or inaction.  See e.g., Continental Casualty Co. v.
Superior Court, 190 Cal.App.3d  (1987).
See above.
That's preventing the creation of evidence in the first place.  That is not
the same problem.  Extending to remailers, disabling the logging function
entirely (rather than just routing to /dev/null or deleting regularly) is the
best policy probably.  Even better is to be a middle remailer.  I fall back to
my earlier position.  Put yourself in the spot to be able to say "I couldn't
give you those if I wanted to cause I don't control them."  Adding to my
earlier position you should rather be able to say "No such logs ever existed
because that function doesn't exist in the software I use." or "No such logs
exist because mail that comes to my system doesn't have meaningful headers on
it anyhow."  Or even better, just give them a full set of 20gigs of logs of
encrypted mixmaster stuff with headers from nothing but 4 other front end
remailers, maybe compressed in an obscure format on old Western Digital Corp
tape reels or something.
Let's not be silly.  That falls under the realm of not creating evidence in
the first place, not destroying evidence that already exists.  If you don't
recognize the difference this discussion is a bigger waste of time than it
already appears to be.  If you routinely tape your calls for whatever purpose
you're creating evidence.  If you take notes, there's evidence.  If there's a
witness, there's evidence.  There is no evidence if two parties are whispering
in a loud Italian restaurant, unless the FBI has rather more sophisticated
listening devices than I am led to believe.  Well, technically there is
evidence in the second party as a witness.  If you tamper with him or her,
you're in trouble too, as Gotti will, I suspect, readily attest to.
They aren't my standards and no, it's not, for the reasons I cite above.
Mr. May Asks:
The children can do a little homework if they are personally interested in
more detail.  As it is I did a bit of research for the list and you Mr. May,
since FindLaw didn't seem to do it for you.  (Not surprising since I don't
regard it as a tool of much use).  Whatever you, or anyone else, might think I
don't pull this stuff out of thin air just to hear myself type.I'm interested
in seeing remailers stick around and grow in numbers.  That's not going to
happen if remailer operators get pinched and bullied on a regular basis.
We've been pretty lucky so far.  I don't expect that to last forever.  There
are so many teeth getting built into "thought crimes" now with respect to
intellectual property that I believe that this evidence issue is going to
become a huge one, akin to what export was (is) in the mid 90s.  You have
DirectTV on the cover of yesterday's Wall Street Journal saying they are going
to pursue end users citing over a billion dollars in "loss" due to pirates
(and needing to dust off their financials for an upcoming acquisition
transaction).  You have distributors whining about the potential illicit
digital redistribution of Planet of the Apes.  You have researchers being
pounded for publishing DMCA violating research.  You have 20 something kids
smart enough to be giving lectures at DEFCON in federal custody, despite the
fact that the FBI buys their stuff, because a corporation got an IP bug stuck
in its rectum.I'm happy to suggest prudent, conservative approaches for
remailer operators, data haven types and suchlike- based on my experience with
courts, white collar crime, production orders, discovery, and etc., because I
think it's needed but even so I don't particularly I want to go romping
through case law every week just to win a battle of egos on a mailing list.
It's only the vigor and venom of your reply that's spurring me on in this
instance actually since you made a few credibility comments that I think might
have been a bit uncivil and unfair.  (Lesson for other posters- to get legal
research for free out of Uni, just insult him a lot).
Well, that's not what you asked for.  You asked for cites on spoliation
generally, or so I understood you to ask.  I also don't remember you
specifying which courts you wanted cases from (though the ones I've cited are
generally state supreme court level or otherwise major citations in the states
they represent.  I didn't spend time in the federal stacks today so you get
state cites.  A little exploration into the FRCP will yield equivalent cites
for federal discovery and etc.
I've seen obstruction and spoliation tacked on to about every white collar
criminal action I have had any exposure to- almost like mail and wire fraud.
It usually ends up in court imposed sanctions.  Expensive ones.  More
importantly the credible allegation that evidence was tampered with or
destroyed by the defendant is a _very_ persuasive thing for a jury to hear.
Murder cases are won on that alone without bodies.  A good place to look at
this is in piracy cases, where the evidence is almost always tossed overboard
and eaten.  Lots of discussion about evidence that the evidence was tossed and
lots of convictions.
I regret that I can't talk in much detail about examples I had personal
involvement with, I hope the cites I provide are enough for you to look
further.  They should be as they are, generally, the premise for much of the
evidence case law out there in this area.  My personal examples probably
eventually resulted in briefs which cite these cases or their contemporaries
because they were the same issues.
Mr. May reminds us:
Hirsch v. General Motors suggests that the "normal course of business" (i.e.
reusing answering tapes perhaps) is not an absolute defense, or even a good
defense, for spoliation.  (c.f. Catapiller which suggests at least that it
might have some weighted persuasive value if it was your attorney who told you
to burn the documents- wonder if there was a malpractice case there?).  They
resold a damaged and refurbished car.  That's what they do.  They are a
dealership.  They sell cars.  Some of them are used.  Some have been damaged.
Routine.  The only problem was that the previous owners then decided to sue
General Motors.  Court, not being amused at the lack of availability of the
car, imposes sanctions and permits a civil action for spoliation against GM
and the dealer.  Look, I agree with you.  That's stupid to me.  Don't burn the
messenger though.  Your outrage at my assertions is better directed to your
legislative representative and even above you've still giving an example above
of not actually creating evidence, unless there actually were taped
conversations that Gotti actually altered or such.I'm not sure remailer
operators can credibly give the "not creating evidence" example yet.
Gotti is probably a bad example to argue your point with.  He did have several
counts of obstruction and tampering which stuck.  I remember something off the
top of my head about several sets of court sanctions against Michael Coiro,
Gotti's attorney (whom I actually met once) related to evidence.  He was
eventually found guilty for money laundering and there was some tampering or
destruction discussion there.  You can write and ask Gotti if you like, if the
throat cancer hasn't got him yet, I'm not looking that one up.  (Mr. John
Gotti  USP Marion PO Box 1000 Marion, IL 62959).
Again, if you don't actually _make_ records then there's nothing to spoil.
That's a different hypo.
To Mr. May's apparent chide that I consider myself a "real lawyer.":
Cites provided.  See above.  I think I show its more than in the ballpark, but
rather a called third strike.
Because the applicability extends farther than just someone called as a
witness or under indictment.  Certainly in tort its _much_ more extensive.
I'm tired of citing, see above.
I think we've addressed most of these above either by discounting them as out
of the scope of discussion or providing cites.
You didn't look very hard or maybe you did but findlaw isn't the best resource
either.  It's for armchair attorneys.  Seriously interested researchers will
spend time at the library, look up statutes and learn to Shepardize.  I
happened to be at the law library for an unrelated matter so I wasted 90
minutes looking this silliness up for you and the list Mr. May.  I herewith
submit my invoice, payable on receipt, for more civil treatment, for services
I actually pointed out examples of how to avoid the problems and cited a real
individual example (but since I did not consult with him or her ahead of time
I left the individual nameless- I see, but have not read- a reply that might
be from said individual on the list now) of a successful dodge of a subpoena-
or harmless emergence from the process in any event.  The point is not to try
and scare anyone, but impose some sense of reality that many cypherpunks just
miss, having never seen the inside of a courtroom or having rendered a court
"unamused."  There's nothing quite like an unamused court if your standing
(sitting) in front of one, and in answer to your implied query- I call them
that because the judge always frowns, scowls, leans forward and says "I am not
amused Counsler."  Suddenly things get really quiet.

Oh, I didn't mean to suggest that it was artifice in this particular case,
apologies if I implied or stated it was.
See my (huge) posting on this, but I would suspect that this isn't great.
Were I operating one, which I am admittedly not, I'd want there to be no data
of evidentiary value ever hitting my memory or media.  To some degree that's
not possible.  In the alternative, actually _disabling_ logging is the best
policy, in my view.  The evidence never existed in the first place then.  It
suddenly becomes a challenge to show some kind of conspiracy on your part
since the actual spoliation claim is harder to make.  Showing conspiracy for
anything with respect to either probably starts hard and gets marginally less
hard in this order:
a)  A middle remailer in a multiple chain that knows nothing (little) about
original sender, content or recipient.
The only evidence of value here would be:
Time of message traversing the mailer (only useful if the specific message can
be linked to the sender which- if mixmaster works- isn't feasible).
Size of message (only useful if the specific message can be linked to the
sender and only useful in so far as the message can be constituted and be said
to be "at least size X" which- if mixmaster works- isn't feasible
b)  A back end remailer in a multiple chain that knows nothing (little) about
content or original sender.
Evidence here in addition to the above:
Recipient address.
Recipient public key (if content is encrypted before mixmaster).
Time of actual delivery to recipients SMTP server.
c)  A front end remailer  in a multiple chain that knows nothing (little)
about content or recipient.
Evidence here in addition to a) :
Sender address.
d) A "one hop" remailer.
Evidence available:
All of the above.
Given that even d) doesn't provide much (and less than not much if you're
never allowing logs to be written in the first place) you can probably make
some guesses about the likelihood of being vulnerable here.
I really suggest that.  Remember that you're going to have to convince people,
not code, or automated rule sets, that you're a decent and non-criminal person
if you do get called to the mat.  Specious sounding arguments about "document
destruction policies" and the like, while perhaps totally technically correct,
aren't necessarily going to help you much- as the mountain of case crap I just
typed in earlier should show.
Since this has become a loud and argumentative issue perhaps it's time for one
of the "what remains to be done" postings I used to do with a long section on
what the next set of remailers should be incorporating.
Advice that will be ignored or regarded, depending on the moods of the
listeners perhaps.

@_subject: Spoliation cites 
And this strikes me as unfortunate, because I don't think courts have
understood this well.
Yep.  Ouch.  Document retention/destruction policy a good idea, but no
absolute defense.
This is the nexus of spoliation theory that bother me.  Consider:
Retention policy is ok under Gumbs (but only in its limited scope discussed
below) only when (under 29 Am. Jur. 2d) "the spoliation or destruction [of
evidence] was intentional... it does not arise where the destruction was a
matter of routine with no fraudulent intent."  The only problem is that the
standard for intent is overly broad in my view.  Consider again Lopez v.
Surchia 112 Cal.App.2d 314.  "A person who acts willfully intends "those
consequences which (a) represent the very purpose for which an act is done
(regardless of the likelihood of occurrence), or (b) are known to be
substantially certain to result (regardless of desire)."  Well, the other
problem is that none of the judges seem to be reading or relying on the
American Jurisprudence discussion, because that "desire to suppress the
truth" language never seems to make into these cases.
To me, in the absence of this little bit of case law from Lopez, Gumbs seems
just fine and logical to me.  With Lopez, however, "fraudulent intent"
becomes the equivalent of knowledge that a court won't have access to the
records if they are destroyed (under the second part of the Lopez test where
consequences are "known to be substantially certain to result (regardless of
desire)."  You'd have to be of IQ < 70 to fail to make that conclusion.
I am reminded of the asinine distinction drawn between "discrimination in
intent" and "discrimination in effect" (the latter meaning that if you
refuse to hire felons, and as it turns out this means that you don't hire
any Alaskan natives because all of the ones who applied were felons, you are
guilty of discriminatory practices even if you didn't even know they were
Alaskan natives.  See Also: "Redlining" prosecution silliness in the early
and mid 90s).  Effectively, corporations and individuals are required to
possess oracle like powers to determine what their retention requirements
are.  That's just silly and very onerous.
Also note that Gumbs is only really talking about how the destruction policy
(which looks to have been a sub-issue of the matter at hand- not a contempt
or destruction charge) will influence jury instructions- in this case what
inferences the jury can be instructed are permitted when in their
deliberations.  In cases where the actual destruction of evidence is the
primary matter of the case things seem to get more serious for the
defendants- maybe because courts spend more time considering the issue.
A jury instruction that the destruction of evidence could be considered
fraudulent is bad.  An actual charge of spoliation or obstruction is worse.
I looked at this after I wrote the above.  Exactly what bothered me.
There are SOME reasonable courts.  Seems time is a weighing factor, but not
an absolute defense.  Same story all around on this issue.
I should have spent the time to look at the federal stacks the other day
because Ruggiero is exactly what I was worried about- specifically that FRCP
and USC would have more teeth and federal courts less tolerance.  Ouch.
I suspect it can only get worse as we start to get more electronic evidence
cases, particularly in IP law- since the criminal sides of that are starting
to show up in civil based actions (much like anti-trust in the 80s-90s).
Everyone is a prosecutor who can afford to be one.

I'm not sure where you have been over the last 48 hours but clearly you've
not been paying attention.
Courts _clearly_ have the ability to demand the production of all copies and
originals of a document.  They have merely to order it.  They _clearly_ have
the ability to smack a gag order on also.  The rest of us settled that
question some time ago.
Uh, no.  And if you had been reading the many, many posts on this point
you'd see that about every one of the 10-15 cases cited here say exactly the
opposite of what you claim above.  (I didn't see a legal background on your

@_subject: Gotti, evidence, case law, remailer practices, civil cases,  civility 
I don't know you or how long you've been around cypherpunks but Mr. May and
I have been bouncing discussions (of both a civil and uncivil nature
depending on our respective moods) pretty much since the list started.
People might claim many things about me, but a lack of respect for Mr. May
is certainly not one of them.
What astounds me, and is right in line with your point about people spending
much more time than 90 minutes on research for this list, is that in an
environment of such dedicated posters (and I totally agree with you- once on
a node like lne.com that does a touch of filtering the content on this list
is second to none- which is why I'm here) so many spend a disproportionately
_minute_ amount of time in such work before making entirely wrong headed
assertions about law and government and yet feel entirely justified
conveying this advice as gospel to their fellows, who often take it at face
value.  (Revisit my IANAL discussion in posts a few days ago in which I
wonder aloud why these posters are taken seriously while the "I am not a
doctor, but" posters are not).  If you've been here for any length of time
I'm sure several of the most egregious examples will come to your mind
immediately without my prompting.
It hardly seems prudent to allow these errors go uncorrected.  In fact, in
my position, I would consider it irresponsible of me not to comment in some
way that would permit designers of code and systems which actually see
deployment (of which this list is uniquely populated) to write systems that
have practical and legal grounding to actually proliferate anonymity and
confidential communications capabilities world-wide without running afoul of
our most esteemed attorney general.
It would have been really nice if someone from e.g. Napster had been
listening to discussions like this back when that company's founder began
design work.  I can think of many other examples in which millions (if not
billions) could have been saved with a little sage and cautious legal advice
properly deposited in the ears of the security or design "geeks" at the
appropriate time.
Do I consider myself _more_ valuable than "geeks" or those who write code?
Don't be silly.  I will constantly, however, assert that the legal issues
that plague all the kinds of cutting edge technologies that consistently see
discussion on this list 5 and even 10 years before they are ever even
considered by the market or the real world, much less a courtroom, require
addressing by someone who actually knows what they are talking about on the
subject of legal process.
I think that's quite a reach on your part if you are pointing it out
generally.  If you mean with specific reference to legal points regarding
the production of documents and such- very much the focus of my early legal
career- then I would submit to you that I would have to be awfully stupid
_not_ to have more experience and expertise in these matters than anyone who
had not spent the amount of time I had in the field.  (I hope that's not a
thinly veiled accusation on your part that I am somehow stupid).  By the
same token you will never, _never_ catch me second guessing, e.g., Mr. May
on topics related to Physics.
Look, I would like to play basketball as well as Michael Jordan.  Is it
somehow unfair of life that I cannot?  Is Michael Jordan insulting someone
when he comments about the game in a way that suggests he knows what he is
talking about?  Of course we recognize this as an absurd assertion.  So why
should anyone be offended by the proposition that "geeks" might not always
have the best grip on the law and need a touch of advice on occasion?  Does
pointing that out somehow make me a snob?  If so, fine.  I'm a snob.  Still,
I readily admit that I don't always have the best grip on system design, nor
do I claim to.
I am more than happy to volunteer my expertise, and my research time, to try
to focus discussions (or confuse discussions depending on your view) with
respect to legal matters that impact system design.  I am _not_ happy to do
so just because someone wants to see me spew out a long list of citations
which they are unlikely to ever read.  (Mr. May is specifically excluded
from this comment because I am pretty sure he actually reads my responses
and checks up on me on occasion).  I, after all, don't demand cites from C++
manuals, or physics texts when a fairly recognized expert in those fields
posts on those topics here.  If I were to make such requests they would be
for my own edification and as requests for references to where I could learn
about the topic, not just to try and prove a point.
Most of the posters I end up citing major passages to have no, and never had
any, interest in learning about law- whether they realize it or not- but
rather putting as little effort into the consideration of it as possible,
primarily out of the grossest of intellectual laziness, while still spouting
off cliche legal errors that have long since been corrected on this list and
elsewhere, like "all foreign embassies are technically foreign soil" or "you
can't drive barefoot, it's illegal" or, one of my favorites, "if you ask and
they don't tell you they are police, then you're safe from prosecution."
Again, and I shouldn't have to keep pointing this out, I hardly mean this as
a reference to _all_ posters on cypherpunks.
One concluding such might also be prone to conclude that geeks are overly
sensitive to such matters because of an underdeveloped sense of the value of
their own work.  This conclusion would be just as much a reach as your own,
above, and not in any way bear resemblance to my attitude about most of the
coders on this list (but completely in line with my attitudes about armchair
posters who are mostly typing the rubbish they purvey here merely to sound
busy with keystrokes in their cube at work).
I think if you review the posts on this topic over the last few days you
might find that I've been perhaps the most civil of the authors, even in the
face of some pretty caustic replies.
Oh, you read them?  That will be $750.00 please.

Mr. Choate levels the kind of accusations that, in academic circles, would

remember it's just Mr. Choate.  If his credibility credit reports are as
anti-accurate as his legal views I take his posts as high compliment on my
astounding legal skill and acumen.
Mr. Choate insists I have some how "pulled a fast one" by avoiding the
discussion of intent, which is implicit as a requirement in all of these
cases.  This accusation puzzles me intensely.
In another of his posts he pretty much insists that I am intentionally
omitting key facts from the case cites which would show the severity of the
problem is actually far less than what I describe.  To wit:
Had Mr. Choate bothered to look up these cases he would have discovered that
the record "loss" in the medical malpractice case (Bondu v. Gurvich) was in
fact several records which were lost or otherwise misplaced at the same time
of which the plaintiff's were but one.  This is admittedly bit difficult to
discern from the appeals case, but is clear at the trial court level.
With respect to "loss" of the car in Hirsch v. General Motors it is clear to
anyone who has spent 10 minutes with the case that the car was sold, as a
matter of course, and records of the buyer not available or otherwise
"lost."  It also came out that this was the practice of the dealership with
respect to many used car purchases that were on terms other than financing
and that many used cars had been sold under the same circumstances with
respect to records and thus "lost" before and since the car in question.
As to his accusation that I avoided the intent issue I can only quote myself
from the very post which is the subject of his accusation:
I suppose what surprises me the most (and then again, doesn't considering
the source) is that Mr. Choate is (intentionally or unintentionally I'm not
quite sure) committing _precisely_ the kind of academic and intellectual
dishonesty that he accuses me of in the very act of accusing me of it,
specifically outright deleting any reference to my clear (and numerous)
discussions of intent to serve his own ends.  What's curious is how directly
transparent this would be to anyone who bothered to read my posts after
Choate's or those of Ms. Farr.  What can he hope to accomplish?  I suppose
woo the court of the lazy?
I don't know what to make of this in good faith other than that the
medication lapsed at exactly the 3 disparate moments in my post when he
caught a bit of intent discussion in my posts.  (This seems suspicious to
me, but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt since I believe him to be a
very sick man).
Of course, Mr. Choate is welcome to provide citations to the cases
themselves refuting my interpretations of them if he wishes.  Someone will
have to forward them to me though because after this I intend to forward all
mail with his name on it directly to the trash instead of to the "Junk"
purgatory it currently enjoys.

I have cited authority for the proposition that courts, and more often
plaintiffs, routinely demand broad productions related to a given matter.
Many here have attempted to assign sinister motives to these production orders

directed to the very legitimate aim, given you accept the court's authority in
the first place- which is another discussion entirely better directed to your

law enforcement and judiciary types).
In my personal legal work some years ago I can think of several instances in
which a copy of a record has increased or reduced the probative value of an
original- and have used them to refute or support claims and allegations in
cases myself.  Courts defendants and plaintiffs know this also and that's why
production orders are so broadly written- and enforced.  I am hardly the only

I have cited authorities.  I have cited examples.  I have given you the tools
to find these and read them.  Either demonstrate why these do not apply
drawing directly from their text (it's freely available to anyone who would

The fact that you don't think courts should exist in their current state, and
that you proclaim so loudly and endlessly, is not going to help you when you
are standing in court with U.S. Marshals or State Bailiffs at your side.  (Ask
Jim Bell about how well taunting a court works).
The cure for your ignorance is simple.  Just find any document production
order at all.  I can pretty much assure you the language will contain "all
documents, copies, reproductions" and suchlike in it and the court will seek
to enforce it.  The light switch is right at your fingertips.  You have but to
flip it up and cease to continue living in the darkness- if you so desire.  I
accept that you might be beyond hope.  I hope other's aren't.
Do you own homework.
Anything else is intellectual laziness at it's finest.

Mr. May replies:
The only thing that comes to mind is the post office's "Electronic Postmark"
which, if you affix to an email, puts the same legal effects and protections
(e.g. mail fraud) on tampering and handling that document as first class mail
enjoys.  Admittedly this is a far stretch from the Post Office having any real
regulatory authority over non-EPM'd email, but it's an interesting aside.
Given the weekly state of my mailbox I am very pleased the USPS has nothing to
do with spam control.
"Don't taunt happy-fun-court."  I think you mean.
Well, true, but 1. what's the difference if the end effect is the same and 2.
as I think the recent Adobe/E-Book silliness demonstrates- those kinds of
cases are going to see quite a lot of exposure now.  Ashcroft just hired
dozens of new "cyber-prosecutors" and it's apparently going to be the Swan
Song he hitches on to in order to propel his career- I suspect.  (Shades of
Microsoft/Bush mutual-fellatiating aside).
Yet we see sites shut down monthly based on "cease and desist" orders and I
think this is the point.  The line between government enforcement and private
enforcement is increasingly blurred (even gone) in a world where government
has realized it can no longer afford to enforce and prosecute these things.
Today Lawrence Livermore would have just hit the Progressive with a copyright
suit and easily gotten an injunction.  If they had put the H-bomb secrets in
an E-book then they'd arrest key people at the Progressive and they might
still be floating around the federal system wondering what happened.  (I think
it was Mr. May who cited the Xerox example- possibly quoting someone else.
Same thing here).  Anything from putting reporting and recordkeeping
requirements and costs on financial institutions and brokerages (for later
ease of investigation), the CTRs everyone has to fill out now (at their own
expense) to privately originated criminal actions under DMCA, Environmental
Protection Act, Antitrust and etc. etc. makes the distinction between private
and public enforcement increasingly meaningless.  This is concerning.  What
difference does it make if a controversial site is shut down by Mr. London as
a prosecutor or by the Church of Scientology?  Free speech is hindered the
same in either case.
Very worrisome.
This more than any other reason is why I hope that remailer operators will
exercise caution (NOT pre-emptively shut down, as some have alleged I intend
them to do).  I think it's pretty clear that free speech is besieged by forces
under the banner of private property rights, funded by a chest of corporate
gold (Adobe, MPAA, etc.) with entirely different interests- none of which have
much to do with free (or $ free) speech.  Copyright is dangerous today because
it is near its deathbed and yet so many fat profit models depend on it.  Do
you think MPAA or RIAA are spending the kind of cash they are because they
feel safely ensconced?  Do you doubt that for every dollar spent on the
Napster case there aren't 2 or 3 spent in lobbying, both overtly and in
backchannel ways?  (Ashcroft's announcements of late should pretty much remove
any doubt that the Bush administration's ear has been bent by the Adobe's of
the world).
Looking at this trend:
1.  Private enforcement actions with a government, not just a plaintiff,
2.  Increasing influence of industry groups and corporations in defining the
medium and content of speech.  (Microsoft XP, Adobe, MPAA, MPEG-4, ATA).
3.  Criminal elements to otherwise entirely civil issues.
4.  An increasing political will to enforce these elements by arresting
20somethings and threatening researchers.
5.  "Credentialing" requirements, official or in effect- of which Mr. May has
often mused.
I think it's time to be just as defensive about resisting compelled disclosure
orders (and making such orders obsolete) as it was to use IDEA instead of DES
back in PGP 1.0.
Unless an EPM is attached.  Perhaps that's the dangerous hook, no?  Granted
there is no EPM _requirement_ today for email, nor can I see how one might
emerge, but several brokerages are in the process of implementing EPMs for
statement, pay stub and trade confirmation delivery as we speak.  AT&T has
started floating trial balloons about sending your statement by paper only if
you pay an extra fee, and doing the rest electronically.  Wouldn't take much
to see EPMs on all your phone bills before long (particularly if the post
office gets clever and tells congress it needs some regulatory correspondence-
say with the SEC as a starting point, to require EPMs in order to stay in
business - or it will have to raise postage instead).  Bingo, EPMs for
everyone!  At least, if I were USPS that's how I would start to try and build
an EPM monopoly.
Interesting times, if nothing else.

@_subject: Final Words from me about document production requirements and remailers. 
I am going to try and be as clear and as slow as possible- knowing full well
that it probably will make no difference and that my words will be twisted,
strawmaned, touted or defamed whatever I do.  Regardless:
Hirsch v. General Motors, 628 A.2d 1108 (1993) effectively opens the door for
third parties to be cited for spoliation of documents or evidence for actions,
potentially and reasonably performed in good faith, before any proceeding or
legal action begins or is even threatened.  Again, this was a products
liability case.  Couple buys a car.  The car catches fire.  People are hurt.
Car is resold to the dealer.  The dealer refurbishes the car.  The dealer
sells the car to a third party in a cash or near cash transaction.
Plaintiffs, much later, sue GM, the car's manufacturer, and the dealer.  In a
typical discovery order the dealer is ordered to produce the car and all
records associated with it.  The dealer insists it cannot.  It has, it claims,
in good faith, sold the refurbished car to a third party.  Court demands
records of the sale to identify the third party, seize the car, and use it as
evidence.  (Note that this harmless third party, who had nothing to do with
this case, had they been identified, would have had their car seized and
impounded for who knows how long, while it was evidence in this case, despite
the fact that they had no idea the car would have been subject to suit, or any
other action).  Plaintiffs sue for spoliation of evidence, move for court
sanctions against dealer and GM.  Dealer protests that their standard business
practice to refurbish and sell cars.  Further dealer protests that they
routinely have cash transactions with few or little identifying records of the
end parties.  (The "normal course of business defense").  Effectively, this
isn't even "destroying" records, but not keeping them.  The trial court
permits the plaintiffs to sue for spoliation, mostly on the basis of the
disposition of the car, not the papers or lack of records, although those are
mentioned, and orders sanctions (a fine and costs) against the plaintiffs.
Case goes to appeal where defendants make the argument that the papers, car
and other evidence were not the subject of a suit or pending suit and that
they were acting in the normal course of business.  The ruling by trial court
is upheld.
1.  Third parties can expect that, good faith or total ignorance aside, their
private property can be seized if it, through no conduct of their own, becomes
the subject of a dispute.
2.  The "normal course of business" is not an absolutely defense in a case of
3.  Actions which destroy or "lose" evidence and that are performed before any
case, action, threat of action or summons can still constitute spoliation.
Willard v. Caterpillar, Inc., 40 Cal.App.4th 892 (1995).
In the normal course of business, consistent with policy and _under the advice
of counsel_ defendant manufacturer destroys all internal records (along with
other unrelated documents) on the design for a tractor.  Some time later
(years) one such tractor results in an injury and becomes the subject of a
products liability suit.  Plaintiffs request the production of all documents
related to the tractor design.  Defendant protests that these were destroyed a
decade ago, on the advice of counsel.  Plaintiff's move for sanctions and sue
for spoliation of evidence.  Trial court imposes sanctions, assesses costs to
plaintiffs, turns court record over to plaintiffs in anticipation of their
suit in tort for spoliation against defendant and refers the case to the local
prosecutor with the recommendation that a case for criminal obstruction be
brought.  (Some notes in the trial record suggest that judge and defense
counsel didn't exactly get along well).  Hundreds of thousands of dollars and
several years later in appeal the assignment of court costs are overturned on
the basis that defendant was acting in something like good faith because they
sought and followed advice of counsel on their document destruction policy and
the destroyed records were thought for some reason to be of minimal value.
Near as I can tell the record of criminal obstruction charge was sealed and
doesn't seem to have been disposed of.  The rest of the sanctions and fines
stood.  The case for spoliation was settled but some undisclosed payment was
made to plaintiffs in that case.
1.  Document destruction policies for a company which are instituted on the
advice of legal counsel might get you out of court costs- after hundreds of
thousands of dollars in appeals.  Sanctions and suit in tort for spoliation
will be permitted to go forward anyhow.
2.  Pissing off the trial court judge (do not taunt happy-fun-court) is a bad
idea when simultaneously telling the court you won't (can't) give them what
they ask for, unless you like criminal sanctions.  (Larry Flint would be
another good example of the consequences of being an insufferable bastard or
having a deep rooted psychological problem with authority when dealing with a
court- sure you might win, but enjoy the lockup for a while in the meantime).
3.  Again, the fact that you had no idea the records might some day be part of
a lawsuit or action means nothing.  If you destroy them, you might get burned
I submit that the facts of these two cases, along with some of the others I've
cited and the FRCP among other statutes, suggest that it's not much of a
stretch for a remailer operator to find him or herself in the midst of a
spoliation dispute- all technical distinctions between remailers and document
destruction policies aside.  Add the intent discussion in Lopez and only an
idiot is going to be careless about operating a remailer.  I'm not going to go
over them all again.  Go read some books.
I submit further that a remailer operator would do themselves quite a lot of
favors if they put themselves in a position to look squeaky clean in front of
a judge if and when this happens.  We have real life-real cypherpunk examples
that this works.  It is clearly necessary, however to improve on this.  This
is because:
I submit that the very operation of a remailer meets the textbook definition
of "spoliation" or "destruction" of evidence just intrinsic to its design and
that its primary purpose is this exact function.  I submit that courts are not
going to be dissuaded from this obvious conclusion without a nice, clean,
young, innocent, harmless looking defendant who is well behaved in front of
them pleading impossibility, and maybe not even then.  Even in that case there
are years and years of archives (read evidence) of discussions from this list
and others demonstrating that remailers were designed and perfected with
precisely the intent of destroying potential evidence.
I would further point out that the "it's just a file trading service, we can't
help what our users do" defense was an utter failure in the Napster case and
that's pretty much _exactly_ what a remailer operator is going to be saying.
Courts are not always as stupid as we'd like them to be.  Court's are not
always as smart as we would like them to be.  The trick is getting these two
mental states timed well.
I would add that the court in the Napster case specifically brought up the
point that Napster, while a file trading service also, was clearly designed
with the knowledge, if not the desire and intent, that it would be used to
exchange/steal/pirate copyrighted works.  The fact that it was a "dual use"
technology made no difference and Napster is slowly twisting in the wind/dead
because of it.  Why, in the face of this, anyone would fail to see the
patently obvious parallel to remailers is somewhat beyond me.
As to the question of Microsoft being pinched for destroying evidence- which
someone touted as having never happened without having bothered to look at any
of the case file on the MS antitrust trial as an example that the sky is
actually purple, MS was _twice_ cited for obstruction, three motions were made
for sanctions by the prosecution and in one of those the judge actually
threatened sanctions (which resulted in the eventual production of the
'missing' documents, electronic in this case.  Further, instructions in the
case eventually included the allowable inference that MS maliciously destroyed
evidence useful to the prosecution.  My only regret in pointing this out is
that I think Mr. Sandfort might owe someone a house.  (I note he never put a
dollar figure on the house bet though).
I grow tired of trying to convince religious fanatics that the world is pear
shaped.  If anyone not a part of my new killfile additions has anything
actually useful to contribute wake me up and I'll probably comment.  Some
unnamed cypherpunk who doesn't want to be later cited for legal malpractice
might write up a set of theoretical legal remailer operator guidelines and
post it anonymously to the list in the next few weeks.  We'll see.

Mr. May replies:
...and why some lawsuit attracting materials are sent via remailers.  And this
I think is the point.
Yes, but in two of the cases I cited no such notice was sent or required.
Moreover, the remailer operator is in a much _worse_ position with respect to
this issue.  How can he or she know which emails are of potential probative
value to a court?  The remailer operator who gets a _single_ complaint
arguably should have to retain _all_ logs and correspondence indefinitely
after that and archive it as he/she is on notice that one or more might be
infringing and he/she has no ability to distinguish which one will be
important- at least under this argument.
But now we are talking about communications sent through third parties with
much more established content immunity (postal service, common carriers, etc.)
Remailers don't seem to be at that level yet.  We are also moving the
discussion to the potential liability of a company who receives these things,
a direct party to the suit, rather than where it was originally, on the
potential liability of a third party for "spoliation" of "evidence" they
wittingly or unwittingly handled.
Making comparisons to Big Studio, Inc. and such avoid the basic point I think.
Big Studio, Inc. for one- has a much more legitimate set of reasons to have a
_document_ destruction policy.  Storage costs and etc.  Now, Big Studio, Inc.
has even _less_ reason to destroy email.  It's easy to archive, bits don't
weigh much (anything), it's cheap compared to paper storage and CD-Rs have a
good shelf life (15-50 years I think I once read?  Your mileage may vary).
What compelling reason does Bob's garage housed remailer service have to
destroy information related to the content that passes his wires.  The first
and most obvious answer is the exact and stated purpose of the remailer-
obscuring information about that content's source, destination and etc.  This
is the problem.  Impossible to deal with?  No.  Criminal?  Maybe, but the
circumstances would have to be extreme.  Potentially the subject of a costly
civil suit?  Potentially.  Potentially subjecting the remailer operator to
subpoena or other nonsense?  Definitely.  Already happened.  It's like someone
(Mr. May?) once said about y2k: It's not the odds, it's the stakes.  A little
insurance goes a long way.
With respect to third parties it's clear that liability for spoliation can
exist.  It's also clear that that can be based on mere negligence.  It's also
clear that there need be no proceeding in progress.  The third party can be
entirely ignorant of a potential case.  All of this is worrisome.
Specific legislation?  Not needed.  Of course the first thing we look for is
specific legislation- that makes the job easy.  The reality is that there is
rarely a statute that speaks directly to a new issue like the liability of
remailers for "infringing" content or thought crime distribution.  If there
were lawyers wouldn't be needed.  (That would be a nice change).
On the flip side it means that prosecutors, in the absence of a specific
statute, are going to stretch what they have and that legislators (trying to
keep up with the lack of specific statutes for technical issues) will write
nice broad laws to keep the prosecutors (which they once probably were
themselves) happy.
Also remember, that criminal liability (which would be covered by statute)
isn't necessarily all we are worried about.  For the graduate
student/salaryman remailer operator civil liability would be much the same
problem, if not worse since if it got to that point the powers driving civil
litigation would probably be better funded and incented than would the feds
_and_ in some cases (copyright, DMCA, Antitrust etc.) will _also_ have the
feds to play with.  Combine copyright with DMCA, Adobe and a remailer and you
have something potentially really ugly for a remailer operator.  He/she might
not even be the focus of the suit, but get steamrolled in the process-
Well, given that there are at least 3 examples I know of where e-mail
destruction (even in Microsoft's case where it was made to look "routine" and
linked with a newly developed policy) was used successfully to impose
sanctions or modify jury instructions I think there is ample precedent for
concern.  Also, as I've pointed out, destruction policies do help some, but
not all _that_ much and the only reason they help is because the large company
has a legitimate reason for the policies (storage costs, maintenance costs,
sorting costs- mostly costs).  Again, Bob's remailing service isn't going to
have that argument (of course the battle of the experts might ensue where Bob,
at his own expense and with the $67.50 legal defense fund raised by the
cypherpunks hires Mr. Trei or someone similar to testify about how these are
normal and best practices- but I'd be surprised if that made a whole lot of
Let's just try to step out of techno-think here for a second.  If you tell joe
sixpack that Bob is running a service that strips off the headers of email for
the purposes of rendering the sender anonymous (not to mention all the other
things mixmaster does far beyond this simple measure) and that Bob not only
full well knew this but fully intended to provide this service- add to that
the fact that it would be pretty easy to show that remailer operators knew (or
should have known) that their service was highly likely to attract illicit or
otherwise litigation attracting content (this is the point right?)- I think
it's a pretty safe bet joe sixpack is going to nod his head a lot at the
prosecutor despite the objections of all these young whipper-snapper
techno-weenies making clever "but it's not REALLY destroying the data, its
just making it totally inaccessible for 900 years without the right key"
arguments.  Now that's just joe sixpack.  I haven't even gotten to thinking
much about what a judge will think of what the prosecution will inevitably
call an "evidence destruction engine."
Here's how I might play this out as a prosecutor:
Mr. Smith, you run a service called the "nobody" mixmaster remailer?
And this service destroys identifying information from incoming electronic
mail before passing it on to the next destination?
So the purpose of this service is to mask the identity of the sender?
If say, I wanted to send a death threat, this would mask my identity fairly
I could probably get away with that then, couldn't I?
The police would be powerless?
The FBI?
Indeed, your service been carefully designed with that kind of threat model in
And are you aware of any legal proceedings involving other remailers?
Are you aware of a similar service offered called the "Free Zone at
blah at blah.net?
So you aren't aware of the legal complications involving that remailer and the
Church of Scientology?
Your honor, I'd like to introduce Exhibit D, conversations on a mailing list
discussing the design of the mixmaster remailer in which the designers and
other participants discuss mixmaster remailer use in deterring legitimate law
enforcement and civil investigations and the Scientology incident
I'd also like to introduce Exhibit E, a list of the email addresses of
recipients on that list during these discussions.
If the witness could please read line 453, highlighted on the sheet there.
Is that your email address?
Does that refresh your memory,  you _were_ on this mailing list during these
discussions weren't you?
So you were aware of these design criteria, to deny identifying evidence to
lawful authorities or civil litigants?
Excuse me, to provide the users with.... total anonyminity.  I'm sorry.
Mr. Smith, do you charge for users of the remailer?
So is it safe to say that you don't intent to profit from this service?
Then your motivation for running the service is... to help people destroy
evidence then?
Ok, sorry your honor, withdrawn.
Then your motivation for running this service is definitely not for profit?
You're a good citizen, as it were?
Yes, of course you are.
You destroy all logs about users of the service, isn't that correct?
Excuse me, you "fail to record" any information about users of the service?
I'm confused.  Someone sends an electronic mail to your service, it has a
"reply to" or a "from" header on it when it arrives, correct?
But before sending it on to its destination, you destroy this information,
Excuse me.  Delete it.  Whatever.  I see.
So people would use this service to mask their identity, if they didn't want
to be responsible for the content they are sending perhaps?
And someone committing a crime, something untraceable, they would be able to
hide behind your service wouldn't they?
But that is a risk of running the service yes?
What about, say a drug deal?
A death threat?
Something libelous?
So wouldn't it be safe to say that a reasonable person might expect some abuse
of such a service by criminals?
Isn't it true that you have an abuse at blah.net address to deal with this
precise eventuality?
So you expected there might be legal problems?
blah blah blah
Now, I've omitted the witnesses responses, the myriad of objections and such
that such an exchange would certainly create, but I think it makes a point.
Whatever the outcome of this exchange in terms of the record the 50+ year old
gray haired Reagan appointee behind the bench and the idiots who couldn't
figure out how to dodge jury duty are going to get a pretty distinct
impression of this service.  It just plain looks bad.  This is what I have to
keep pointing out.  It doesn't _matter_ if its technically kosher.  It just
plain looks bad.  I'd be surprised of some of the jury members didn't write
their congressmen insisting a law be passed to rid us of this scourge of
remailers after a clever prosecutor got to them.
We need to work hard on making remailers look better in this kind of a
scenario.  Granted it's extreme, but that's how cypherpunks define their
threat models- no?  Overkill is our friend in security design, plus, it's
usually pretty cheap to add 64 bits to a key.
I've only thrown this example together using typical prosecutorial tricks (use
of the word "mask" instead of hide, use of the word "destroy" instead of
strip, work in a parade of horribles, etc. etc.) that came to me off the top
of my head.  Yes yes, armchair lawyers, I've lead the witness a few times and
such to keep the space down, but I could get it all in with twice the space if
I really wanted to.  So could any good courtroom lawyer.  I'm sure someone who
had prepared carefully would be plenty more sophisticated about it, and run
the witness into plenty more traps than I bothered to get into.
But that's going away slowly.  The EPM, digital signatures, archival services,
all of these things are moving towards permanence, not away from it.  I can
find ancient posts I forgot I even wrote from years back on google or anywhere
else.  I can't find any of the paper copies of papers I wrote from back then
anymore in anything less than 2 hours of looking.  I'd say digital technology
is doing just fine in this regard.  Sure, there's bit rot, but it's closely
coming to be not much more significant than microfiche run, or paper mold,
perhaps even less so with the introduction of cheap CD-R technologies and
coming cheap DVD-R technologies.  If anything the persistence of archives and
search engines is having the reverse effect, one of the reasons I started
using a nym in the first place, one of the reasons I continue to.
Also, courts are constantly whining about the potential destruction of
evidence in such a way that it's caused major erosions of the 4th.  No-knock
searches are primarily justified at the threat of lost evidence to the court.
E-mail and electronic data is the ultimate threat for lost evidence.  It takes
just a power interruption to destroy all the information (read: evidence) on a
poorly (properly?) designed system.  Doesn't that make you wonder if
eventually, over the next several years these sorts of things are going to be
taken much more seriously?
When there is no more "smoking memo" because the office is mostly paperless,
the smoking e-mail is going to be the king of the Hollywood courtroom drama
scene.  Expect e-mail to get more, not less onerous for people handling it.
[Good stuff about Lessig removed]
Because the case is much easier to make that a remailer operator knew or
should have known that there was the potential for content coming across his
service to be the subject of a dispute.  That's the whole point of the
remailer.  It shifts the risk and costs of investigation to the remailer
operators, from the sender.  It follows that in the efficient market the
remailer operators are the best able to deal with that risk and those costs,
hence their willingness to shoulder that burden.  I think today that's not
necessarily so and given that the risk of handling illicit information has
geometrically increased over the last few years (DMCA etc. etc. ad nauseaum)
it only follows that remailer operators should follow suit and augment their
risk management efforts.
The inescapable reality- despite all the window dressing we might put on them-
is that remailers perform a single function- making email untraceable- from
which a few purposes legitimate- free speech, recovery groups, human rights,
whistleblowers- and illegitimate- libel, copyright violation, etc.- may stem.
I'm going to take the liberty of pointing out (without taking a position one
way or the other) that even the _legitimate_ purposes are somewhat at odds
with the interests of courts and the judicial system.  Specifically, someone
admitting they have just bought and currently possess 2 grams of cocaine on
narcotics anonymous and god if they aren't trying to resist using it if only
their NA buddy would answer the phone- is a contemporaneous admission of a
felony (to wit: possession of narcotics) in which a court has a legitimate
interest in preserving the evidence for (whatever you think of drug laws or
the jurisdictions of courts and etc.)  Whistleblowers are probably in
violation of an NDA somewhere.  They are circumventing law for the "higher
good."  That "higher good" is generally going to be a matter of perspective
and it will vary in its weighted importance depending on the individual.  (One
man's freedom fighter, another man's terrorist, etc.).
Remailers are a "short circuit" of some of the really poor and unfortunate
outcomes of all information being traceable and available to courts.  (Insert
discussion of importance of anonymity and its critical role in everything from
political speech to the founding fathers, the federalist papers etc.)  But
let's be frank and recognize that not everyone, particularly non-cypherpunkish
types, will appreciate that or consider that a "good thing"(tm).  To these
people a prosecutor's description of an "evidence destroying engine" is going
to probably stick- even if it was objected right out of the record (which it
may or may not have been) and the jury instructed to disregard it (which they
may or may not have been).  Some of the high end plaintiff's lawyers I've
encountered and worked with will actually test their catch phrases ("evidence
destroying engine") on focus groups to see what sticks- what they can slip in
that will stay with jurors even if they can't read it in the record later.
Sometimes they will do these things by adding in what they know about the
jurors.  GM and Hogan & Hartson were very good at this- using demographic
information about the jury to tailor "objected away" comments to stick in the
minds of mothers, single working professionals, etc. right to the end.
Depends on how you want to define obligation.  Do you think a manufacturer of
a product has an obligation to keep old design notes around for over a decade
even when their attorney tells them they can toss em?  Do you think a car
dealer has an obligation to keep around every used car they ever get their
hands on, instead of selling them, on the off chance they might be evidence in
a suit?  Do you think Microsoft has an obligation to keep every single email
they ever sent just in case they one day get sued for Antitrust?  I don't.
Courts have all found some level of obligation (of varying severity/intensity)
in these examples.  I think they are all patently silly.  I think they are bad
law.  Doesn't change the fact that they are precedent.
The key factor in all these is that information a court wanted seemed to be in
the possession or control of these parties at one time or another.  A remailer
operator, in my view, is much likelier to be in a position to handle such
information, or be seen as a potential source of the information, than the
same individual not running a remailer.
But they DID go after MS.  And MS was almost sanctioned for it and it _was_ in
the jury instructions.  Remember also that Microsoft lost at trial.
Moreover MS knew this was a potential problem and therefore specifically did
_not_ have an email destruction policy in place before the suit- at odds with
some of the fervent (and totally unsupported) claims by persons here that they
did.  They had a very aggressive e-mail _retention_ policy.  As early as 1992
they asserted that all U.S. emails were preserved for fifteen (15) years.  (!)
See e.g.,:  Los Angeles Times, November 5, 1998.  See Also Generally: Wendy
Goldman Rohm's outstanding book "Microsoft File: The Secret Case Against Bill
Gates."  Microsoft then instituted a far less inclusive "retention policy"
(See Caldera v. Microsoft) and also an "upgrade policy."  As it happened the
"upgrades" didn't convert over the old mail.  This was the subject of the
potential sanctions and quite a to-do at the time.  Mind you, these were all
in the context of "routine" destruction.  Since then I understand from third
parties that they have changed their policy and now archived email is pretty
much allowed to slowly rot and general disinterest paid to archives, no policy
is actually implemented- much better looking really.  Just careless, not
A compelling technical argument.  Not so compelling without lots of expert
testimony in court.  _I_ agree with you, Mr. May.  I'm pointing out that we
need to find ways to give remailer operators more shielding than these kind of
technical arguments- which courts do not traditionally have an easy time
understanding.  (Napster, MPAA, RIAA, Microsoft, etc.).
Again, the fact that no statute exists hardly gets you out of the woods- none
of the cases I cited rely on a statute to impose sanctions, except for the
relevant rules of civil procedure and potentially obstruction of justice,
which is such a catch-all that it can be applied here.  (CALEA is dead at sea-
and I hope it stays that way).
Mr. May later comments:
My broker, banker, and financial advisors all will accept signed email
instructions from me.  I rarely give instructions this way, however- that's
personal preference.  They are not the only ones either.  I know of three
large trading operations that use email now to deal with large contract
trades.  (They used to use fax).   Moreover they keep archives for 10 years of
all their customer e-mails.

Technically speaking, if the homeowner is justified in using deadly force
otherwise (fear of imminent harm to life or property etc.) and in the absence
of a clear identification of the intruder as an officer, (verbal or otherwise)
contemporaneous street justice is the only thing that the homeowner needs to

Beefing up security in conjunction with the commission of a crime is certainly
taunting Happy-fun-court.  No different than the old "why use crypto if you

liability cases.  The effect is to make safety profitable- or more accurately,
to make unsafety unprofitable.  See generally Posner, Hallman and the "Chicago

the idea that you are very wrong about the effect of liability on innovation.

[On products liability, strict liability and innovation]:
Bash all you want as long as you do it in an educated way.
With a hammer as big as litigation in the United States, everything might as
well be a nail.  I take no position on the good or ill of this particular
state of affairs.
Both of which are just extensions of the possibility of loss through products
liability suits and other legal liability.  The plaintiff's lawyer is key in
the mix in all of these examples.  Auditors are the passthrough to investors
and other interested parties of information which might indicate the company's
vulnerability to such a suit.  Auditors drive their customers to adopt these
practices because they have a fiduciary duty to draw attention to the potentia
l harm and because they are the authority to define standard practices.
Insurance companies heighten their standards to adjust coverage premiums based
on the company's potential vulnerability to such a suit.  They judge these
vulnerabilities based on the babble and/or blessings of the auditors.
Exercise for the student:  Name three market forces which might cause the
innovation of air bags as a safety feature which are not litigation related.
(Hint: it's a hard problem- it's also a pointless one because air bags were
finally brought to market- they had existed for years- specifically because of
3 law suits in the United States).  Do a little leg work.  Who first deployed
airbags in their cars in the U.S.?  When?  That should tell you quite a lot
about how they got there.
Which are in turn driven by losses, lawsuits and again by extension of those:
customer requirements.  It all comes down to what the insurance company
expects to have to pay in policies and what they expect to get in premiums.
What they have to pay is based on loss expectations.  Those loss expectations
are heightened by threat of legal liability.  Those payments are irritating to
the customer.  The customer does a basic analysis:  When is my break even
point for the investment I am going to make in improved metal boxes vs. the
decrease in premiums I expect as a result?  It's basic econ.  Very basic.  Are
you really trying to assert that legal liability- perceived or actual- is not
the driving force behind product development in these areas in the United
States?  You might want to read some Posner before you comment again.  (See
Also Generally:  Bank Robberies and Bank Security Precautions, T.H. Hannan, A
Theory of Economic Loss in the Law of Torts, M.J. Rizzo, Accumulating Damages
in Litigation: The Roles of Uncertainty and Interest Rates, J.M. Patell, R.L.
Weil and M.A. Wolfson).
It's been happening for years, except it comes under the careful auspice of a
"SAS70 Audit" (Statement on Auditing Standards No. 70) and not a blatant MS
bashing fest.  SAS70 had information security provisions in it as early as
1995 or 1996.  Why?  Because the ABA and the AICPA- who despite much mutual
animus often get together to discuss such things- thought it a good idea to
introduce infosec as a section into the standard report format.  (I was, _very
tangentially_, involved in some of that.  These were the days of Michael Baum,
Verisign and the ABA, Stewart Baker, Export Control, AICPA and the
Commissioners for Uniform State Law).  And why not?  For the ABA- it meant the
possibility of servicing clients with respect to shareholder derivative suits
and other liability for information security "negligence" now that a standard
has been articulated.  It also meant that proactive litigation preparation was
a possibility.  (One Baker & McKenzie Partner, Gary Fresen did effectively
nothing else but this stuff for Baker from 1996-1998).  For the AICPA- it
meant the possibility of including what was then thought of as a lucrative
professional services practice (Information Security Consulting) in their
consulting side offerings.  All of the large accounting firms spawned an
information security practice about 1995-1996 if they didn't already have risk
management groups which could address the areas.
Again, it was the threat of liability that drove all these developments, and
hence at least partially drove the huge market for firewalls, PKI hype and
(frankly) helped to make RSA what it is today.  (What, you thought it was all
Bidzos' genius?)
The pattern has always been the same.  Some clever 17 year old exposes
weakness, exploits it.  Papers go nuts.  Shareholders whine and some sue.
Insurance companies and auditors slowly take note, adjust standards.  Market
responds with new products and lots of hype.  This is the evolution of
security.  Always has been.  You think that Checkpoint Software got where it
got because consumers suddenly wanted a bunch of innovation for no reason at
all other than it was Monday afternoon and there was nothing interesting on

Points all taken.
Points also taken.
Think of it this way.  The proposition that the strict liability doctrine
makes is that certain activities are "ultra hazardous."  One of these is
product design.  Strict liability- essentially the proposition that no showing
of negligence is required for the plaintiff to prevail- is generally thought
of as a mechanism to allocate the risk onto the market actor.  Economically
speaking this is intended to spur the innovator to "self insure" or to design
safety (safety from litigation anyhow) into the product, or at least have a
strong regard for it during the development process.  This in contrast to the
negligence standard- where the innovator has to have been shown to be
willfully negligent in design and therefore a good portion of the risk of the
product development is shifted back to the end user.
The theory is that if your goal is to reduce accidents and claims you allow
the market to incorporate that sort of risk (which in early innovation looks a
lot like an externality) into the innovation process.  Activities, it is
argued, which cannot be made sufficiently safe to be economically viable in
the market will not be undertaken because the market will not support such
activities.  Proponents of products liability point to this in justifying the
policy.  (Critics primarily point to the unfairness of assigning liability to
actors who have not acted negligently).
The showing for a plaintiff for products liability works something like this,
although admittedly this is very simplified:
1.  Plaintiff used the product according to directions.
2.  Plaintiff was injured.
That's pretty much it.  This is why safety is a big deal in automobile design
and why gun manufacturers have managed to duck major products liability issues
for the most part (misuse).   Since automobile design flaws of sufficient
magnitude can cause death and big money law suits, the market has incorporated
that component of the risk into the design cost of the product either ex ante
(during the design process) or ex post (by compensating the aggrieved
parties).  Costs are shifted onto the market when they are passed on (ex ante
or ex post) in the form of product cost.
This is the way that strict liability specifically, and the legal process in
general, tends to spur on innovation.
Well, I would argue that it is self adjusted by the market when we are talking
about products liability.  The market has put a price on safety by forcing
producers either to design safe, and limit ex post costs incurred by
litigation in favor of ex ante costs, or minimize safety spending and catch
the costs ex post.  Either way the costs are spread over the market and at
least mostly linked to the actual effect of safety provisions in reducing
harm/accidents/etc.  If a mini-van is too costly to make "safe" then it will
not be produced.  That's the point of strict liability.  Force the actor to
spend more time evaluating the wisdom of the action.  This often necessitates
more R&D and hence more innovation.  (Faster airbags, better seat belts, etc.)
Saying "the cost of safety is already too high" is probably misplaced- at
least in this isolated example of automotive manufacture.
Mr. May says in a related post:
Standards only really come into play in a negligence, as opposed to strict
liability, setting.  With strict liability standards are not part of the
discussion.  For software or security the strict liability argument by the
plaintiff would go:
1.  Plaintiff installed Firewall 1 correctly.
2.  Plaintiff was hacked.
Liability insues.  (This is an obvious simplification, but not by much).
All of Mr. May's other points are valid.  Even the imposition of a general
standard for negligence (the reasonable sysadmin standard?) would be a bit of
a headache.  I'm a little surprised we haven't seen more of this because it
effectively means that the first big case where someone sues on infosec
grounds will require the court to DEVISE a standard.  That would be bad.  Very
bad.  As it stands now big firms can blame their auditors.  "But we DID a
SAS70, what more could we have done" and probably get off scott free.
As for strict liability, this would be an absolute disaster, which is why I
don't expect to see it ever applied.  (Stranger things have happened though).
This liability issue has been batted around the list a few times over the last
couple (many) years.  I found this bit which I wrote about strict liability to
the list back in 1996:
The more things change...
Well, in so far as he was standing for the concept that innovation was in no
way ever connected to litigation, the Chicago School would disagree with him
quite sternly.  (The Chicago School is unamused?)
Sure.  Anything I can do to help further the understanding of misanthropes on
the list, I am happy to do.

universities now more than they are about scholarship.
Some people get quite a lot out of a legal education.  They usually end up
being trusts and estates attorneys or something.
Just about every lawyer I asked about law school discouraged me from going.  I
went anyhow.  It seems to work that way.
The first day of law school I remember they passed out an anonymous
questionnaire to everyone in the room asking why you came to law school, some
other lefty stuff about your politics and what you intended to do with your
degree after graduation.  As it turned out 60%+ indicated their intention to
go into public interest law of one sort or another.
Before the last exam my last year they handed out the same questionnaire they
had three years earlier.  The results:  90some% of the same class had accepted
positions in corporate private practice.
Do not go to law school suffering from the delusion that you are going to come
out, join a big money firm and change the world by quashing the DMCA.  Perhaps
you will, but the partners are hiring their little associates for one reason,
to pay for those cherry wood offices and the but the odds are awfully slim you
will be working on the DMCA.  There are so many lawyers out there right now
you might find yourself stuck without much in the way of prospects.
Professional basketball is a decent alternative.
I've never felt more like a prostitute than I did when interviewing for large
corporate firms out of law school.  They send three or four senior associates
to the city they are visiting, rent a hotel room in the Marriott and put a
chair outside the door.  You show up five minutes early, sit in the chair in
the hall, looking at the other candidate interviewing with another firm
sitting at the other end of the hall in a chair, and knock when your appointed
time has arrived.  The last hooker who was in there leaves and you go in, sell
yourself in a foursome for 30 minutes then get up when you hear the next knock
and prepare to turn your next trick 30 minutes later.  Lather, rinse, repeat.
Do the math to figure out what it takes to bill 2200-2400 hours a year.
That's BILL mind you, not work.  That's pretty much what you will be doing for
the first 4 years as a corporate attorney.
I'm not sure how EFF pays, I suspect not particularly well.  The high end
corporate firms generally start their first year associates around $110-125k
or so for top end of the top school graduates.  More in New York maybe.  The
_median_ salary for a Stanford law grad is $95,000.00 if they go into
corporate practice.  Just over $40,000.00 for public sector work.
Bingo.  You certainly built a rolodex tho.  (Given who's in the white house
now I'd try Baker Botts)
Remove the "very" above and you've got it on the head.
The only real fun in law I ever had was in litigation.  Litigation is VERY
hard to get into.  At the same time of the three major name litigation firms I
was more intimately familiar with one held the esteemed reputation for having
had _every single_ male partner in the firm suffer a coronary of some type or
another, the other had two partners commit suicide in two years.  I won't even
go into the state of affairs in the third.
Worse.  Writing contracts.  Even worse, reviewing already written contracts.
It's past the curve.  Most decent IP/Patent firms pretty much REQUIRE an
advanced engineering degree (Masters/PhD) from MIT/Cal Tech/etc. plus the law
degree on the way before they will even allow you to interview with them.
Agreed.  Without getting too deep into a rat hole I still think that law can
tell coders and architects quite a lot about the neat places to be looking,
and the dangerous places to tread.  It's a tool.  Same as watching the stock
market reports.  But we've been over that.
Don't bother with law school as a career change unless you:
1.  Can score above the 96% on the LSAT.
2.  Can get into a top 20 school.  (Better a top 15 or top 10 school).
3.  Can finish in the top third of your class (hint: the bottom of the curve
doesn't follow you to law school and some of the idiots there have been
threatened with being cut out of the will if they don't follow in Dad's
4.  Can tolerate 3-5 years of 14 hour day ass kissing of the highest and most
offensive order after graduation.
I find law is extremely useful in my day to day affairs but I'm probably not a
good example.  I got quite a bit out of being in the legal world in D.C.,
particularly rolodex wise, at exactly the time crypto and intelligence issues
were getting to be a big deal in the public eye (Clipper, export regulation,
etc. etc.) but I had a certain level of exposure that was probably atypical of
most legal types on the Hill and I never intended to go seriously into private
practice as a career.  (As an aside I went to a "alternative careers for law
graduates" seminar once.  There were two attendees including me and the
A J.D. is a professional degree here.  A vocational degree in the United
States, as it were.  (Much different in Europe).  Really the J.D. program in
the U.S. should be a 5 year PhD type program but that wouldn't make the
universities anywhere near as much money because they couldn't command the
number of applications they do now.  It's all about future value of the degree
and that high starting salary.  (Contrast this with the fact that Stanford
University's Law School, ranked  right now, has a 61% national bar passage
rate.  Nearly 40% of Stanford students fail the bar the first time).
If you can go and not care much about your grades, and have the money, and not
intend to practice, it could be amusing.  Then again, given these
circumstances so could medical school.
Yep.  The most interesting lawyers I know are either professors, took high
level positions in government, or do something OTHER than practice law.
Or anyone going into investment banking.  See today's wall street journal on
the (lack of) prospects for MBAs.  (CSFB I think it was, indicated that it
doesn't plan to hire ANY until 2003).
There will always be exceptions.  What drives the hoards of law students we
see today is that $125k/year average starting salary figure.  The $75
application fee starts to look worth it pretty quickly.  They usually don't
know what they are getting into and no one in the admissions office is in a
rush to tell them either.  Some schools are much more cut-throat than others
too.  It can be a very unpleasant experience.  (I might add that you should be
prepared to be celibate for 2 years as no law student I knew had much of a sex
life until after the second year internship- from which most offers are
extended- was secured).

@_subject: Liability, economic realities and self delusion in ecash developers. Or: Why not "just write ecash" (again). 
[There isn't much new to talk about so instead...]
I think I can speak to this with some degree of experience.
Legal liability is the big issue.  By "continuing personal involvement" I
will assume you mean acting as an officer of the company.
The most serious level of legal liability that concerned me was the
potential for criminal and civil sanctions for money laundering.  I am
constantly amazed by the level of self-denial cypherpunks have when it comes
for legal liability in this regard.  (Usually this is justified with some
cutesy-clever technical argument- as if no one had been watching the
Napster, eGold or RIAA developments at all over the last few years).
Money laundering is a slam dunk for prosecutors and very tempting to use
because of its connotations to a jury/defense counsel.  It is simple to
allege.  It also has MAJOR impact on potential sentencing.  Consider:
"Analyzing actual cases, the working group found that money laundering
charges most often involved a relatively routine financial transaction
(e.g., depositing, wiring, transferring, withdrawing money) that was
essentially "incidental" to an underlying crime (e.g., a fraud, gambling
offense, or drug sale) that the defendant charged with money laundering had
also committed. The working group concluded that while the underlying crime
usually appeared to be the real gravamen of the overall offense conduct, a
money laundering count could generate a guideline offense level that was
quite different from that of the underlying offense, and, as a consequence,
greatly influence the sentence."
"With respect to what the working group categorized as "white collar"
offenses (i.e., fraud, embezzlement, import/export violations, and copyright
infringement), the working group found that the addition of a money
laundering count raised the defendant's offense level 96% of the time, and
frequently to a significant degree. For example, in one reasonably typical
case examined by the working group, the defendant had committed a fraud and
deposited the proceeds of the fraud in the bank. Consistent with court
decisions construing the money laundering statute, the government charged
the deposit of the fraud's proceeds in the bank as money laundering, in this
case for "promoting" the fraud by allowing the defendant access to the funds
for personal use. Pursuant to the fraud guideline (2F1.1), the offense level
for the underlying fraud was 19 (guideline range of 30-37 months for
defendants with no criminal history). Pursuant to the money laundering
guideline (2S1.1), the offense level for the money laundering offense - -
here, promoting the fraud by depositing the fraud's proceeds in the bank for
personal use was 28 (guideline range of 78-97 months for defendants with no
criminal history). Thus, the addition of the money laundering count in this
case substantially increased the defendant's sentence."  (United States
Sentencing Commission Report).
While this might not directly impact the person running or developing the
system it certain serves to discourage users of the system after a single
allegation has been made.  Customer flight would be awfully dramatic I
suspect.  This makes a system which is bound (by design and definition) to
be political unpopular also highly subject to political interference.
It's the civil provisions that I find more alarming though.  One dollar of
laundered money in an account subjects the entire account to seizure.
That's not a good thing and assuming any ecash system had correspondent bank
relations (a safe assumption if you know anything about financial systems.
No.  Ecash for widespread public use is just not a viable proposition at
this point.  Even less so after 911.
I believe it is.  Given the current state of the law money laundering might
as well be the anonymization of transactions for unpopular purposes (the
entire purpose of ecash).  It is a political definition, not a technical
one- much as "terrorism" has become.
I assume that the suggestion is that a smaller operation, a grassroots one,
would somehow fare better.  I don't believe this is the case.  More below.
Money Laundering is its own RICO.  (See e.g. Elkan Abramowitz, Money
Laundering: The New RICO?, N.Y.L.J., Sept. 1, 1992).  Again and again, here
and elsewhere I've cited cases and statutes that make it pretty clear that
innocent third parties easily become the victims of money laundering
prosecutions and lose their businesses, their checking accounts, college
funds, their homes, etc. simply because their family run travel agency
accepted a check from a drug baron they had never met to pay for his trip to
South America.  An ecash system, particularly a small one, simply has no
chance once it is used for child porn once or twice.  A large bank might get
away with it the way large banks do.
Hawala systems are effectively 100% certain to be subject to laundering
charges when discovered operating in the United States.  They are not much
more than primitive ecash systems.  The timing for suggesting that such a
system would have any legal lifetime is pretty bad given the current
environment.  The trend in such things in the United States is moving
strongly AGAINST financial privacy, not towards it.
U.S. law is probably the most extreme, so that might be a safe assumption.
(Perhaps Britain would be nearly as bad).  What is missed here is that "the
developer is not linked to the operation" is a very optimistic assumption.
It's the developer that will have to consult on the implementation, on the
security provisions, on deployment, designing against the threat model.
Anyone who believes this process won't trigger the "knew or should have
known" provisions is kidding themselves.  Invoking the Terrorist example is
probably extreme for discussion purposes but I doubt that anyone here, if
they were to really think it out, would believe that the author would not be
detained in a Federal Detention "Submarine" for weeks at a time in this
case- direct involvement or not.  The threshold for detention these days
seems to be "knew someone who once met a terrorist."
I suppose if someone wanted you badly enough they would make arguments which
included conspiracy, money laundering, conspiracy to commit terrorism,
conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to... [fill in the blank].  The BEST
case scenario in the case that they wanted you badly enough (and doubtless
this would happen in the example you cite) is that you turn states evidence,
show them the best way to break or introduce a break/trojan into the system
and fall into the pit of witness relocation, looking over your shoulder for

X will come calling.  There is that other cute clause too.  "Material

I'm not sure Dmitri would agree.  Regardless, the issue was much different.
Dmitri wasn't a U.S. Citizen.  I daresay the situation would have been
entirely different (worse) if he were.  This was effectively a civil, not a
criminal action, despite DoJ noise to the contrary.  You're not dealing with
the prosecutors in the organized crime/money laundering group who are a lot
more cut-throat (and a lot more experienced at cutting throats).  Copyright
and DMCA are a fairly new area and attract young and inexperienced
prosecutors.  The result is a certain uncertainty and experimentalism with
techniques and legal theory.  None of these failings will afflict a
prosecutor in the money laundering/organized crime sections of DoJ.  These
people play for keeps.
I submit that this belief indicates you've never seen the inside of a
federal prison.  Remember also that terrorists don't go to Danbury.  They go
to the Supermax in Colorado.  Also, most states have money laundering
statutes too.  You'll be lucky not to do time in both a state and a federal
prison during the course of your ordeal if things get nasty enough.

See, all the arguments you make by comparison apply equally to Napster.
(Particularly insofar as they ignored the potential liabilities and civil
actions when they designed the system).  Let's face it, if there's no market
for ecash what's the point in developing it.  Cypherpunks are remarkable
socialist when it comes to ignoring market forces in order to favor the
develop a "cool" and esthetically pleasing system that no one will use.
This is unfortunate.
Legal problems or not, and different members of this list will have
different views about how realistic it is or isn't to be harassed over
writing some code.  In the end it makes little difference.  The problem with
ecash is that it doesn't do enough things significantly better than current
solutions for a retail system.  It does some things much worse.  I've always
believed that the best deployment would be in a interbank role, where
clearing and settlement actually have important time components-
counter-party credit, Herstatt risk, etc. and the sums are large enough to
make small to moderate improvements in performance important.
Coding is hard, let's go shopping?
In other words the market for it?
"Start-up" is the part that trips it up, not "large and collaborative
project."  At least, insofar as "start-up" means "spend untold millions
hiring 150 recent college grads for $120,000 a year, trying to beat
Microsoft for 'most opulent campus' hiring a 'start-up advisory' firm to
clean the mess up after your third failed follow-on financing and otherwise
acting like idiots."  Competent firms, and competent managers don't do such
things.  (Granted they are few and far between since 1997).  Don't paint
dot-coms with a brush so wide it slathers legitimate ventures as well.
As for small ecash projects you might want to consider something.
Historically there is a certain group of firms that are among the, if not
_the_, most stable and reliable financial institutions.  Those are closely
held private banks.  In Switzerland, Austria, and once in Italy, these are
subject to unlimited liability.  (Usually they are unlimited general
partnerships).  That means that the owners are fully liable for all the
liabilities of the bank to the extent of their entire set of business AND
personal assets.  Usually they are run by well known families with
substantial fortunes.  I am not aware of any of these institutions failing
(or indeed failing to make a profit) since they have existed (provided there
was an heir apparent to the institution in existence- eliminating the "last
round" problem).  At the same time these firms provide little, or indeed NO
disclosure over their activities or holdings either to depositors, or to
authorities.  One firm I know of pays the same amount in taxes every year,
even if they owe less, to prevent any reverse engineering of profits.  This
same firm returns 17%-20% regularly on their "Silver Fund" for which no
prospectus or description is available- even to investors.
All this illustrates an important principal.  Secrecy and limited liability,
by necessity, have a zero sum relationship.  As you increase secrecy you
must decrease limited liability in step.  "Secret, Limited Liability,
Successful, pick two."  The combination of limited (non-existent) liability
and secrecy is simply an impossibility for a financial organization.  "A
Small unknown and poorly financed firm" might as well be limited liability
for our purposes- no one is going to see a dime back from it if it fails.
Also, note that unlimited liability has a much stronger assurance quality.
(See e.g., Enron, FDIC insurance for the failure of "disclosure" to properly
compensate for limited liability or moral hazard).
Additionally, based on my experience doing business with cypherpunks there
is no hope for "business credentials without identity" amongst those who
should be the most receptive to it.  (The due diligence demands of
cypherpunks I've encountered in the business world far exceed those I
endured at the hands of European banking authorities).  Then again, perhaps
the paranoia of cypherpunks types is better developed than that of European
banking authorities.  (That could be taken many ways, depending on your view
of European banking types).  I suspect that you might find that a small
ecash project, which by its nature would appeal to cypherpunks as clear (and
perhaps the only) first adopters will find that most cypherpunks "would not
invest $1 of my own money in such a thing."  That should be all that needs
to be said about the viability of a "small ecash project."
Perhaps one might make a distinction between the development of an ecash
system and its deployment, but I doubt it will make much difference.  The
basic tools of ecash have been floating about for some time.
I submit that we should endeavor to find a motivator a bit more solid than
that it would entertain the developers.  It sounds suspiciously as if you
might need an entertainment center in your dot-com campus.  Entertainment
for the developers is, of course, what the firm is in business for.  (From
what I know of you that's a bit shocking to hear.  If that's all the case
then just write the damn thing and distribute it via usenet, Mr. Lackey).

Mr. May indicates:
Not that this has even a touch of relevance to cp's but-
I refuse to use anything else.
Ancient German P7 secret:
You can decock the pistol silently by disengaging the squeeze cock mechanism
under the trigger guard and flush with the depressed squeeze-cocker with the
thumb on your free hand and slowly releasing pressure on the cocker.  It's
pretty easy to engage the cocker silently as well, but why bother?  I
consider it like a set trigger.  It only gets cocked when the target is
acquired, identified and in the sights anyhow.  If you really need that
first shot to be deadly quiet you can hold the trigger down while you prowl
and use the squeeze cocker as the trigger instead.  (Sort of like a Steyr
SSG set trigger).  They are interchangeable.
You can pound them to death and they deliver first shot accuracy every time.
I put my first one literally through the wringer as a tester before buying
my second.  I doubt my torture testing was as official as the series done on
the p7s by the German army, (which includes an encounter with an APC) but I
was awfully satisfied.  They chew up +P+ ammo with ease.
They are one of the few well manufactured pistols that have properly
balanced tolerances with a fixed barrel and still aren't subject to a lot of
jamming or ammo pickiness.  It loves being dirty and will shoot on and on

with good ammo, like say Golden Saber, the gun, if not the user, will
outshoot about anything that isn't designed specifically for competition

Mandatory is a flexible word in this case.  It's pretty easy to avoid
service if you really want to and are willing to pay a waiver fee or to
substitute service.  (The fee is returned if you make up the service).  The
latter is more difficult, but not impossible.  There are provisions also
for the exemption of 'conscience objectors.'  One will have better luck in
the French Cantons than the German on this point.
Every reservist or regular must compete in compulsory shooting exercises
yearly.  It's not much of a chore.  Over 200,000 citizens voluntarily
compete in the national 300m long rifle contest each year.  Women compose
about 30% of the participants in recent years.
Personally, I think mandatory service, when the requirements are as light
as they are in Switzerland, is a good thing (tm).
It's actually not "military personnel" but more like every household that
is required to maintain firearms.  It is true that each reservist or
regular in the army is issued a service rifle and two boxes of nicely
sealed ammunition.  Most cantons, however- and particularly the German
side- require every household to maintain a fully serviceable weapon and
other supplies.  Some cantons will even perform spot inspections and assess
fines if the weapons are not in proper order and ammunition not properly
stored in the right amount.
The mobilization goal of Switzerland is to have their autonomous civil
defense zones up and ready to fight in 48 hours or less.  Most cantons and
sub zones are tuned to mobilize in an afternoon.  Places like Zurich and
Geneva might have more extensive preparations and hence long mobilization
The Swiss standard issue rifle is the outstanding Sig SG 550, but the Swiss
call the service rifle the Stgw90 (Sturmgewehr 90).  They also call the
ammunition the GeweherPatronen 90.  GP90.  It's a 5.6mm round (to distance
themselves from NATO) but entirely interchangeable with SS109 ammo.  All
the Sig 550's will take NATO 5.56 ammo without a hiccup.  They even have 1
in 7 twists and will deal with heavy or light NATO ammo well.  All service
rifles for the military are manufactured exclusively at the Sig factory in
Schaffhausen.  Having visited there I can attest that I'd be happy to eat
off the floor and ask for seconds.
Substituting the SG 550 for the SG 552 Commando Carbine is an option.
Outside of military service firearms are easy to come by and concealed
carry permits equally easy (with exceptions in some cantons like Vaud).  In
most cantons a Swiss citizen is automatically considered a "collector"
after his or her fifth weapon purchase.  The application for a license was
becoming such a rubber stamp process by 1996 that a proposal was made to
pre-print application forms with "for collection purposes" under the reason
for requesting a license.  (That being the politically correct reason to
request a firearm at the time).  The police were not amused so you actually
have to write that down now.
I've never experienced a permit application that took longer than 30 days
to approve, incidentally.
Fully automatic weapons are obtainable if you are a collector.  (i.e. have
purchased 5 other weapons).
There is no restriction, other than common sense, on the purchase of ammo.
Individuals can freely import 500 rounds of ammo per instance, if they
don't want to buy Swiss.  I'm not sure why anyone would prefer not to buy
Swiss ammo.
Not only that but the Swiss assign specific officers to bank duty on a
given shift.  They are generally armed with fully automatic weapons and
have a poor sense of humor when on duty.
I can relate from personal experience the plight of a French youth who
attempted to rob a bank in Zurich.  He held up the teller (a charming young
woman) with a .22 pistol and demanded 100,000 CHF.  The teller calmly
reached into the bank drawer, placed a stack of bills on the counter.
While the French youth gawked at the bills the teller calmly drew a 9mm
pistol and deposited two rounds in the youth's collarbone and shoulder.
The youth fell to the ground, dropped his pistol, recovered briefly, picked
up the gun again (probably a fatal mistake) and fled the bank.
Unfortunately for the youth the bank manager (wearing what must have been a
$3500 suit) drew his own concealed handgun and gave chase.  Outside of the
bank the youth turned around on the street on hearing the shout of the
manager, raised his weapon and was promptly dispatched by the bank manager
with a chest-head double tap.
Police arrived on the scene, (in about 30 seconds as a bank duty officer
was across the street) took the report of the bank manager, asked for (and
were refused) a copy of the bank surveillance tape (which was later
provided to the head administrative officer reviewing the case) and left.
The entire incident was cleared up and forgotten in 3 hours.  The bank
continued to transact business throughout the entire affair.
Messing with a Swiss bank is like messing with a lion's dinner.
Speaking of G8 nonsense- I suspect that if held in Switzerland most of the
merchants and land owners would be asked to leave because the authorities
would not want a bunch of dead foreigners.  I can assure you that no shop
owners would have been "spraying looters with automatic weapon fire."
Instead they would have been surgically dispatching each and every
participant with center mass three-round-bursts.  While killing several
dozen might send a good message, killing every single one of them with
Swiss (read military) like precision would be bad press for a low-profile
The Swiss are very stern- if politely so- if you break the rules.  If you
break them violently they are just as politely lethal and simply will not
let you interefere with the conduct of business.

This is why I like most cypherpunks.  They have the most charming naivetÃ©
about the real world.  It's quaint.  I see it most often in their
propensity to argue to most obscure technical-legal points with the full
expectation that a judge isn't just going to say "that's specious
counselor, have any real arguments?"  I love hearing things like: "Well if
I just have the micromint transfer all its money to itself first then
that's legally a transaction, right?" or "I'm not transferring the e-gold

"Sorry your honor, I used key splitting to put the key in 4 jurisdictions
so I can't recover the critical financial data under subpoena.  Now you
have to send me home.  Hee hee!"
The second most frequent expression of this kind of sheltered thinking is
in the political-societal belief that there is no such thing as "street
justice" in the United States and that officers aren't prone to poke the
odd protestor with a nightstick in any country except Mexico or India or
the Middle East or some other far away and out of sight place.  "But this

I would be amused to see one of these cloistered techies in a real

on the street is a good whack to opposing counsel's head and that about the
most serious ramifications of this might be that the protestor gets off
scott free after 48 hours in holding with the gang bangers.

Here is an article on the kidnapping of Adobe co-founder Chuck Geschke:
An excerpt:
It was supposed to be a normal day at the office for Adobe Systems
president Charles "Chuck" Geschke when he pulled into the parking lot of
his Mountain View headquarters on May 26, 1992. Instead, his kidnapping at
gunpoint by two Arabic men began a five-day nightmare in which Geschke was
blindfolded and unaware of his location. His frantic family, in the
meantime, enlisted the help of the FBI in a search that was the biggest of
its kind since the kidnapping of Patti Hearst. Chuck's rescue was triggered
by daughter Kathy's drop-off of ransom money and her negotiations with the
captors. The news of the kidnapping made headlines all over the world. The
family, still, has not fully recovered from the emotional harm.
To this day, [Chuck] still has flashbacks when he drives into a parking lot
void of cars or people. And he has replayed his capture dozens of times,
both during and after captivity, questioning his decision to obey the armed
The nightmares, which continue to this day, were just the start of a whole
new deck of fears the family had to deal with once they returned to Los
Altos after their month retreat. Chuck's insecurities about his safety
invaded all aspects of his life. The 6-foot, 1-inch, 220-pound Chuck now
scares easily.
"I see someone walking or parking in front of the house and I try to notice
if there is anything suspicious about it. I never, never had that feeling
ever in my life before. I've always been a very open person, never felt any
physical fear of any kind," he said.
end excerpt.
Following the kidnapping Adobe made such substantial changes to security
that employees jokingly, and not so jokingly, refer to it as "Fortress
Adobe" now.
I think you're going to have to decide if it's a wise idea to provoke these
people.  Peaceful protest is a good thing.  Still, be careful.  Mr. Geschke
and the FBI are awfully tight now.
A clever and subtle tactic.  Exactly what I would expect from the more
clever cypherpunks.  (Even more clever to suggest its use to others, rather
than using it yourself).  Please use it carefully.  It might send entirely
the WRONG message.

What militia men?  Hard to agree with a statement I didn't make.
You mean your interpretation of same.  I shouldn't really need to go into
asking why the protestor in question had picked the thing up and continued to
hold it if not to throw it.  Certainly he wasn't cleaning the streets or
looking for a trash bin.  Whatever the case, you are no more in his mind than
I am and simply asserting that he wasn't going to throw the object doesn't
make it so.
I think that is hardly the issue.  Who cares who started it?  All of that
presupposes that the protestors were there in the first place, fully aware
that armed authorities would be present and that some protestors were likely
(certain?) to get violent.  After that decision it starts to matter less and
less who did what when.
I think the issue is that a masked man, who shows up with clear intention to
cause at least disruption if not "trouble," probably earned his fate by being
present while his comrades, associates or mere spatial neighbors, pounded on
armed police men.  Wearing a mask and carrying a heavy object probably didn't
help much.  The _very best_ interpretation is that our departed "protestor"
was terminally stupid.  Literally.
Not sure I understand what the one has to do with the other.  Given that the
cops endured their vehicle being smashed at, even with weapons drawn, for some
time before discharging a weapon, I'm not sure I would rule them "trigger
happy" either.  Again, "trigger happy" is subject to your personal
interpretation and therefore more than somewhat useless.
Incidentally, who said anything about soldiers?  For the uneducated, the
Carabinieri are in fact military police.  They are empowered and sworn as
officers and complete police training.  All Italian police do some riot
control training.  Comes in handy for the football matches and the world cup.
Also for the uneducated, a "peacekeeping action" is generally undertaken by
the United Nations in an international conflict.  This is "riot control" or
"crowd control" an entirely domestic affair.
I never claimed to know their intentions excepting the obvious- to cause
trouble.  (This is, of course, what even the most innocent protestors are
there to do).  Anything above that is your invention.  Here was my quote:
As the common high school graduate will see, though perhaps the colleges in
the valley are less up to snuff, I pointed out that most of them were not from
Genoa (a fact widely echoed in media), they were there to cause trouble (i.e.
protest) and that they had the effect, therefore, of generally burning down
someone else's neighborhood.
You don't actually dispute any of these facts, I notice.  Only impose your own
set of facts and claim, erroneously, that I alleged these instead.
"Some protestors are stupider than other protestors" in other words?  Even if
so, what does that have to do with any of my points?  And what is your point
exactly...?  That the intent of the other 90% was to sip Lattes and take in
the warm Genoa breezes?  I don't think so.  It was also "to disrupt the
meeting of the Group of 8 through their actions."  Or at the very least "to
smash some pigs while we have the excuse to be lawless."
Did it have the effect of "fuck[ing] up the city of Genoa" ?  Look at the
pictures and tell me what you think.  Extra points if you can put a number on
the cost of the cleanup to this point.  (I'll announce the correct answer in
48 hours to the list).
That's strike four for you.  You're striking out quite a lot today.  In fact,
I know substantially more about you than I know about Giuliani.
In any event, I apologize for branding you as a classless armchair anarchist

inactive seating.  (If you want to send me your long distance bill, I'll also
apologize for calling you an AT&T customer- I will point out though that
certain young parties in the Pacific Northwest will be upset if you don't burn
up those minutes calling at all hours of the night though, Mr. Woods- AT&T
might be in your best interest).  It's also much easier to see your face in
the pictures of you I have than it is to se Mr. Giuliani's face.  (Most of the

distorted by its close encounter with a projectile).

Probable cause to arrest exists where facts and circumstances within officers'

sufficient in themselves to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the
belief that an offense has been or is being committed; it is not necessary
that the officer possess knowledge of acts sufficient to establish guilt, but
more than mere suspicion is required.

I said:
Mr. Trei replied:
Here is some text from an order I was a party to some time ago:
Further, [someone who was kind of naughty] is hereby ordered to produce and
disclose all copies, originals, reproductions, derivations, translations or
other documents related to [a certain document] _within his direct or indirect
control_.  (Emphasis mine).
That's pretty typical, the control part.
Copy is an old term of art.  "A transcript, double, imitation, or reproduction
of an original writing, painting, instrument, or the like."  As distinguished
from original: "As applied to documents the original is the first copy or
archetype; that from which another instrument is transcribed, copied, or
imitated."  Part of the confusion is because "copies" and "originals" bear
different evidentiary weights.  Copies can only be submitted as evidence in
lieu of originals under certain circumstances (because of the risk of
alteration or forgery or suchlike) and blah blah blah.  "Copy" started to see
the use you are describing because of the following kinds of exchanges:
Prosecutor:  And do you still have this document?
Witness:  No.  (Thinks: but I have a xerox in my briefcase- ha ha ha).
Very true.  Consider:  "An original of a writing or recording is the writing
or recording itself or any counterpart intended to have the same effect by a
person executing or issuing it.  An 'original' or a photograph includes the
negative or any print therefrom.  If the data are stored in a computer or
similar device, any printout or other output readable by sight shown to
reflect the data accurately, is an 'original.'"  This leads to the very
strange situation where data on a disk (not readable by sight) is not an
original or a copy but a sort of "quasi-original."  A meta-original if you
will, capable of spawning infinite originals- as it were.  It's curious to me
that no one has pursued this kind of argument in a copyright/MPAA type case.
It's not readable by sight is it?  Might be too technical an argument.
I don't know the details but I suspect that they are trying to control
evidence that might compromise an investigation or otherwise collect all the
evidence to be sure that everything is covered?  It doesn't sound THAT
unusual.  Courts generally try to grab everything to make sure nothing is
destroyed, lost, stolen, tampered with... etc.
Since such a prospect is impossible it's a good tactic.
Never try to outsmart forced disclosures.  Make it impossible for you to
comply with them in good faith.  Outsmarting them just makes prosecutors mad.
Making such disclosures/surrenders impossible makes them frustrated (i.e. mad
but unable to do anything about it).

Well, IAAL and today seems to be legal terminology 101 day.  If only I billed
for these hours...
I can only assume you pulled this from some odd orifice or Perry Mason re-run
because it bears little relation to fact.
Obstruction of Justice- Impeding or obstructing those who seek justice in a
court, or those who have duties or powers of administering justice therein.
The act by which one or more persons attempt to prevent, or do prevent, _the
execution of lawful process_.  The term applies also to obstructing the
administration of justice in any way- as by hindering witnesses for appearing,
assaulting process servers, influencing jurors, _obstructing court orders_ or
criminal investigations...  (emphasis mine).
In this case, such of it that I know, it's going to be contempt of court
that's going to be more onerous in any event, but if you have been irritating
enough you can probably expect an obstruction charge too, particularly as your
refusals begin to look more like actions and not mere inaction.
Also remember the recourse of the unjustly incarcerated contempt sufferer- an
expensive, slow and usually useless appeal.
Same problem.
I suppose if I wanted to stifle it as a judge I'd also order the production of
all "media, machinery, computer equipment or other tangibles containing the
content.... blah blah blah."  Again, it's all evidence.  It's all within the
court's power to grab.  It's an entirely legitimate act of the court to
attempt to control and otherwise restrict the distribution of evidence or to
protect it from destruction or distribution (such as in a libel case).
Remember the mystery implement inside the envelope in the OJ case and all the
expert imagery wonks analyzing the shadows and contours of the envelope to
determine that it might be a big knife?
By involving third party system administrators you've done nothing but make it
more expensive for third parties who are going to lose the stuff if its seized
or otherwise subject to discovery.
There are a few cypherpunks probably listening to this who've been smacked
with subpoenas for running remailers.  I think you'll find that the government
is pretty persuasive to third parties like these.  The only defense (which one
administrator of a remailer I won't name was clever enough to set himself up
with) is to say (my paraphrasing) "I don't have access to those logs or any of
that data.  I don't keep such logs and I never have because it's too much
overhead and work."
You miss the point.  They don't have to do diddily.  By this point you've been
ordered by the court to produce such documents.  So produce them or direct the
court to them or pay the price and have the court get them anyhow.
The difference is that in  the witness does not have physical or logical
control of the evidence and cannot, even if she or he wanted to, produce it or
otherwise allow the court to put its hands on it or prevent its distribution.
I disagree that the data is "out of her control" in example   Courts aren't
fond of leaks.
Ask the question: Can the witness produce the document?  If the answer is yes,
then the witness will have to.  Ask the question: Can the court prevent the
distribution of the data (via gag order).  If the answer is yes then you can
expect it to be prevented.
The time of the mailing is unimportant.  If the data is known or should have
been known to be the probable subject of an investigation you're still on the
That's implicit in the "all copies and reproductions" language.  Ask yourself

Totally false.  The court has made an order.  It involved the production of
documents or other potentially exculpatory and material evidence.  You pretty
much have to comply because the court says so.  Well, let me rephrase that.
You can refuse and spend some time in lockup until you decide maybe you want
to comply.  (That can be a long wait.  Years is not unheard of).
That person is pretty clearly obstructing justice.  I'd suggest they not hang
about the U.S. if they decide to knowingly distribute material that is under
subpoena or a gag order or somesuch.  Very naughty.  If I were a judge I'd
certainly encourage the prosecutor to order marshals to apprehend that
individual and bring them before me for some special attention.

It's a base conflict.  A legal education is the ultimate dose of practical
cynicism.  It quickly becomes apparent not that the law isn't perfect, but
that it is often pretty damn screwed up.  American jurisprudence is about
_fairness of process_, not justice, or right, or wrong.  The frustration that
IAAL types usually have is that IANAL types tend to cross the line from
criticzing the law to giving legal advice which is more derrived from their
dislike for the state of the law than a recognition of what it really is.
Well, again, the legal education process is designed around navigating through
the system, not mapping the behavior of governments.
Oh, I wholly agree.  And I believe this is a fully valid function for
cypherpunks.  Unfortunately, it often shifts into "you should design this

Pretty close I think.
Not being intimately familiar with the spec of freenet I can't really comment
on that aspect or what a court will consider "impossible."  What will not
amuse a court is the appearance of an ex ante concealment or disclosure in
anticipation of court action.  If it looks like you knew it was going to be a
court issue and you put it on freenet for that purpose, you're in trouble.
Not only that but if you encrypt the stuff and it doesn't appear to be
recoverable it almost sounds tantamount to destruction of evidence or
spoliation (much more serious).  ("The intentional destruction of evidence...
The destruction, or the significant and meaningful alteration of a document or
instrument...")  I've never seen a case play out like that but I would
certainly make the argument as a prosecutor.  Encrypting the stuff sure
_looks_ like spoliation, particularly if it seemed likely that the evidence
would be the subject of a judicial action.  "Knew or should have known" will
likely be the standard with respect to the stuff being the subject of judicial
action and they can use actions to demonstrate intent.  In this light freenet
might be the _worst_ place to put it because its only purpose is (I believe)
to avoid censorship or seizure of the data.  Why would you have used this
relatively obscure and very specialized service if not in anticipation of
court action which would later prevent the distribution of the data?  Who else
was threatening the manuscript, document, etc. to such a degree to require you
to use freenet?  (Not only that but spoliation carries with it the permissible
inference that the data was detrimental to you and the jury gets to hear
There are legitimate purposes for escrowing it on the Isle of Man over and

stand on when asked "if not trying to thwart the authority of this court, why
did you do that."  Good answers might sound like: "I wanted the proceeds of
the manuscripts sale protected in trust for my grandchildren."  "I wanted the
negotiations to be handled by the same attorney that manages my spendthrift
trust"  (You do have one, right?)  "I wanted to publish it anonymously, and
needed a good attorney in a jurisdiction with strong confidentiality statutes
to accomplish that end.  I had no idea that the irrevocable trust was so far
reaching that it would deny access to a legitimate judicial proceeding, your
honor..."  I'm not sure there are many arguments for using freenet other than

Hardly "knew or should have known" unless... well Mr. May you'll know better
than I will how naughty you've been.
If you know you've committed some kind of weapons violations or some such and
you have reason to believe you have come to the attention of the authorities,
burning the record of those bulk AK-74 purchases might be a bad idea- if you
got caught.
I've seen more of this in the white collar world, where billing records,
transaction records and such were destroyed but the principal holds.
Still, based on what you seem to have read me as saying we probably lost a
good deal of the context of the discussion.  The original question, as I
understood it, was what an individual who was faced with a clearly pending
court action (or an existing court order) could to do frustrate that order and
prevent certain materials from being distributed- _without consequences_.
My discussion was limited to that context, though I did not probably clarify
that sufficiently.
I also made some speculative suggestions about what encrypting such data might
look like in a test case extending the facts to be a bit more edgy just to see
where the limits were.  Such a test case (of which there are none to my
knowledge) would easily present a close issue to argue if a savvy prosecutor
were around.  I'm not sure anyone could tell how it would come out.  Consider
it a cautionary note for cypherpunks designing evidence destroying
(concealing, whatever) systems.  I never asserted a the kind of law you
describe above existed.  A careful re-reading of my post will reflect that.
Spoliation is usually used in specific reference to evidence, not a case or
prosecution.  Again, I think the context got lost after my fifth post on the
subject or so.
I could cite any number of obstruction and contempt examples, two from
personal experience.  One in which the defendant wished to prevent the
disclosure of certain financial documents and other information to the court,
all of which were secreted away before any proceedings began, but when it was
clear the improprieties were going to come to light.  One in which the
defendant wished to disclose certain information (for not in my view the most
kosher reasons) to the public which was the subject of a case and also the
subject of a judicial gag order.  Both efforts landed both defendants in
confinement for a period of time- both times on contempt rulings.
I can cite some case law if you really want or if there is some legitimate
need for more clarification, but we are a bit far afield of the original
discussion now, and that was not intended to allege anything close to the kind
of prohibition you seem to be talking about.
I don't have any.  This was my theory.  Hence my language: "It almost sounds
tantamount..."  Hence my cite of the definition of spoliation below, for
comparison.  Hence my discussion of a prosecutor's likely tactic in making the
argument.  Encrypting to an "irrecoverable" key certainly comes close to if
not outright meets the technical definition of spoliation in Black's Law
Dictionary.  What "irrecoverable" means will depend on the judge probably.
Well, that's not the hypo I remember but in any event the case doesn't need to
have been called, the defendant merely needed to "know or should have known"
that the material in question was likely to be the subject of a legal
proceeding or material evidence to same.  (Given that some states might have
different standards- this is pretty close to what you can expect generally).
The burden of proving that aside, that's the standard.
Burning the offshore account statements on the morn before your indictment for
bank fraud is going to get you a spoliation/destruction of evidence charge.
Encrypting the statements to some (unrecoverable?) key looks very much like
the same thing, doesn't it?  The effect to the court is certainly the same.
Again, if I were a prosecutor I would at least make this argument.  Its
success would probably be 100% dependent on how much cotton the judge has in
his ears at that particular moment, how badly he wanted to get out of court
and meet the call girl he just reserved (ever wonder why Friday's are always
"motion days"?) and how "unamused" he is with the defendant.  I talk a lot
about how "not amused" a court is because, frankly, that has a substantial
impact on the way rulings go.  At least in my experience judges are very
unlikely to be receptive to motions by a defendant that has pissed them off.
(Sorry- TP?)  Absolutely.  If you know that something is or will be evidence
to a crime and you destroy it knowing full well that a judicial proceeding is
imminent, or knowing that an investigation is being considered, you've
committed a felony in most states.  It wouldn't take much effort for you to
look up the California statute on destruction of evidence or spoliation.
Depends on your definition of "real lawyer."  I hold the degree.  I'm licensed
to practice somewhere or another.  I've probably made 15 or more motions
before courts in various proceedings in various jurisdictions.  I don't
practice anymore so perhaps that disqualifies me.  Still, all of this is
academic- just as this discussion is.  My qualifications are irrelevant.  You
got my opinion for free.  I think I can fairly say you got more than you paid
for.   Look up the statutes for yourself.
Keeping to the contextual caveats above- I reassert my position.  You can't
simply knowingly deny a court access to evidence or testimony and not expect
to get bit.  Hard.

@_subject: Reflections on "High Concept, Low Tech," Martial Law, the new Paper Gauntlet and the changing meaning of 911.  
Amid the flood of profound, pseudo-profound and posuer-profound writings that
have found their way- like so many thrice forwarded bad jokes or internet
chain letters- to me since Tuesday, Charles Platt's work "The Enduring Power
of Stupidity" clarified quite a number of things, at least to my way of
thinking.  Though perhaps not for the reasons Platt intended the work gelled
some number of thoughts many of which had been rattling around for some time.
"There are two basic forces in the world..." Platt begins, "Intelligence and
stupidity.  Human intelligence generally is creative, and has the potential to
enhance our lives.  Stupidity almost always is destructive."  I immediately
thought of the phrase "If we make this idiot-proof they will simply design a
better idiot."  Hold that thought.
High Concept, Low Tech
"High Concept, Low Tech" is a term that has been tossed around quite a bit
lately.  What is interesting to me is that the asymmetric attack on Tuesday
was not by any understanding "High Concept, Low Tech,"as is being repeatedly
reported by this or that expert.  Quite the reverse.  It was precisely
because- at least partly because- the 757s/767s piloted by our most recent
of note were extremely sophisticated that the attack was so successful.  A
number of factors came into play here.  Firstly, though an expensive- relative
to most like operations- attack to implement, both financially and temporally,
operation as it was mounted on the 11th was far cheaper because of the simple
ease with which 757s and 767s are flown, at least once aloft.  As of Tuesday
fly-by-wire is to "terrorists" what Perl is to script-kiddies.  Inevitably as
technologies enable humans to move more metal and petroleum tubes faster,
further and higher with less brain work, less training and less expertise than
the day before... well, more potential energy, less brains equals higher risk.
This "black box syndrome" means that a housewife behind the wheel of a Volvo
can effortlessly brake like Schumacher. It means that Bob Smith can hurl
412,000 pounds of metal and fuel at a building- and it
is only going to get worse.
In April of 2000 Bill Joy wrote an article in Wired that has always frightened
me a little.  Chief among his comments:
The 21st-century technologies - genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics (GNR) -
are so powerful that they can spawn whole new classes of accidents and abuses.
Most dangerously, for the first time, these accidents and abuses are widely
within the reach of individuals or small groups. They will not require large
facilities or rare raw materials. Knowledge alone will enable the use of them.
Mr. Platt, unwittingly I think, invokes Joy in his article.  "Ultimately
computational power should enable us to manipulate matter itself," says Platt,
"...enabling a new era of unlimited wealth while eliminating side effects such
as pollution and global warming."  But, Platt points out, "On Tuesday I saw
that stupidity still trumps intelligence."
I fear Platt is right.  I fear Joy is right.  The inevitable march of
technology puts more in the hands of the few faster and faster.  Black arts
are fewer and farther between.  Cryptography is a prime example.  Publishing a
second.  Biotechnology an emerging one.  In all of these disciplines what was
once the bastion of a few dedicated researchers or government types has been
shattered by tools that now create a universality that increasingly becomes
disturbing to contemplate.  As force multipliers approach an individual as an
acceptable seed value, controls approach impossibility and risk increases
geometrically.  From the crossbow to the handgun to the semi-automatic rifle,
individuals increasingly have more and more power to destroy.  A single
twisted mind suddenly has the power to suffocate, blind, destroy, kill, maim
hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands.  The only challenge today is
to find the right context.  In a crowd an expert with a handgun can probably
kill or severely wound 10-15 people with some effort.  On an airliner an idiot
with a handgun can kill 300 with no effort.  A few moderately intelligent and
directed individuals with third rate edged weapons can kill thousands and
simply erase tens of billions of dollars of wealth in 4 hours.  High concept,
high tech and high impact.
What I haven't heard said yet is that on Tuesday we all bore witness to what
must have been the most successful conspiracy in some centuries.  Dozens if
not hundreds of individuals working in concert, over two or more years to
mount this operation and maintaining operational security and operational
focus throughout.  Given the short selling in a few key insurance firms a few
weeks before the incident the operation might have even turned a substantial
profit.  The high water mark for the lowly funded population of a layman black
operation is now in the hundreds.  I suspect most counter-intelligence people
would have placed it at 10-15 as recently as Monday.  If this is the case what
of the day- surely not far away- when a group of 50 can mount a nuclear
program of moderate success?  A biochem program of moderate success?  Or as
Platt muses, when "...computational power should enable us to manipulate
matter itself."  Perhaps to synthesize plutonium?
At the risk of sounding "Seganesque" I suspect our species might well be too
curious for our own good.
Martial Law
The events of September 11th have not been the first and are not going to be
the last example of technology (in whatever form) put to ill use.  Terrorism
will doubtless have several banner years in the next decade, the likes of
which have not been seen since the many skyjackings in the '70s.  The
insidious thing about these kind of attacks is that they tend to result in
something akin to martial law.  Freedoms and liberties are necessarily
curtailed- and yet nothing changes substantially.  Terrorist operations are
well designed to seek the underbelly and hit soft targets.  They are easiest
to mount in predominately free societies where terrorists can live and travel
in relative freedom and obscurity.  They also have the most impact in such
environments, where the citizenry is used to relative peace, tranquility and
privacy.  The foreign policy of the United States, particularly with reference
to the Middle East, doesn't make friends quickly- consider it the externality
cost of the cheap oil Americans so dearly love.  This combination probably
means a profound overreaction (I think we have all seen this already) and
potentially crippling "temporary" measures which have a life all their own
once implemented.
Inevitably, all of this is going to result in a plethora of measures, proposed
measures, programs, "temporary administrative agencies" and so forth.
Ellison's half-baked national ID proposal, the "homeland defense" cabinet
level agency- if this doesn't sound like something right out of 1930's Berlin
I don't know what does- plus crypto restrictions and even internment camps.
All of these things are- of course- fairly useless.  Terrorism has found its
killer app in finally targeting the United States on a large scale- a fat and
slow target with few natural defenses that are not overcome by mildly clever
manipulation of immigration laws and customs, instantaneous communications as
well as international air travel.  Would you rather mount such an operation in
The United States or Israel?  The United States has a binary decision to make.
Either stay a generally free society and endure the occasional and nearly
impossible to prevent suicide-terrorist acts or impose martial law,
fundamentally altering the social landscape of life in the United States.
(Not that it couldn't have been said to have been irrevocably altered already.
I never thought that- even as a foreigner- I would be so disturbed by a
display of patriotism- or even hyper-patriotism- as I have come to be by the
many American flags waving around as far as the eye can see.  The rapid
transformation of the star-spangled to a war banner of anger, vengeance and
mourning all at once is unsettling in the extreme).  Between those two choices
the former is a hard thing to envision.  Americans as a population generally
look for the "quick buck."  The immediate solution.  Long term is often lost
on the masses.  Enduring more World Trade Center like events (for there are
sure to be more from whatever source) is hard to imagine.  America has been
"security spoiled" until September 11th.  Unfortunately, I fear rash decision
are on their way.  "What would you give up for security."  "Right now?
Everything.  Anything."  Oh boy.  Here we go.
The New Paper Gauntlet
The common theme in most of the proposals I see today revolves around
identification.  Today, as most members of this list well know, there is no
real "national identification" system in the United States right now.  There
is however, a paper gauntlet.  A maze of paper filings and credentials
required for almost every private- and some public- activity.  Driver's
licenses are not mandatory, unless you want to drive.  State issued
identification is not mandatory, unless you want to fly, open a bank account
or do anything else productive.  Running this paper gauntlet and its many
forms, applications, checks and so forth leaves a strong trail of activity
behind the individual who is not careful enough to frustrate this system.  It
does have a weakness today however.  There are few universal databases in the
United States.  Citizen movements are not catalogued ex ante in a single
system today.  Many systems must be correlated ex post once a citizen has
brought attention to themselves.  There is an investagatory barrier to
rebuilding the steps of a given citizen today.  Not a large one, but large
enough to prevent massive fishing expeditions, and large enough for the clever
to slip between the cracks- either for privacy or for criminal activity.
Those smart enough to keep out of sight usually have no problem circumventing
the system slightly for innocent purposes.  Today the temptation has become to
institute more stringent and centralized controls in the hopes that such
efforts will create a good chokepoint from which to identify troublemakers.
As usual, this is an illusory bit of security.
Paper gauntlets are annoying and expensive- so much so that the costs are
certain to be amortized across private sector industries and such.  They will
still serve primarily to create records best used in ex post investigations,
not in preventing crime.  CTR's, currency transportation reports, foreign
account suspicious activity notices and the like are all ex post measures.
Centralizing or consolidating records will probably raise the bar for casual
paper trippers slightly, but not sophisticated attacks like the September 11th
operation.  It has come out this week that as many as 12 western educated men
and their families may have been murdered to provide terrorist operatives with
fresh, and undisputed, identities to use.  In the face of this kind of resolve
a national ID program, or any of the other measures being publicly floated
will do little- if anything- ex ante to stop terrorism, particularly the brand
that spends 300 to 400 thousand dollars per operative in "blend in" efforts.
I'm most alarmed by the fingerprint smartcard proposals that are floating
around from the great public policy genius of e.g. Mr. Larry Ellison.  These
will be entirely useless unless every place they are used requires a two or
three factor authentication.  1.  Possession and presentation of the card and
therefore the digitized, stored fingerprint data.  2.  Presentation of the
individual's fingers to provide the fingerprint for checking against   3
(optional) a pin number or other unlocking mechanism for the credential data.
What, after all, is the point of providing fingerprints unless they become
part of the authentication process?  Otherwise individual Y might as well kill
individual X and steal the card.  Since individual X's prints will never be
compared against the card what is the benefit?  Personally, the prospect of
exposing my biometric data to a terminal and operator of questionable
experience, skill and motive every time I get on a plane, make a transaction,
apply for a bank account, get a driver's license, etc. etc. bothers me.  Of
course, the United States has not learned that such data, when not protected
properly will be abused.  Credit card numbers, social security numbers and now
fingerprint indexes.  No collective memory.  Pity.
Paper gauntlets have long been the easy tactic to try and address these kinds
of issues.  The "Credentialing of America" as one cypherpunk (Mr. May?) put it
continues.  They have also universally proved ineffective.  Still, we should
all expect to have to run a much longer and tighter paper gauntlet.
All of these things are vulnerable to origin fraud, however.  Since Bob has to
be able to replace his credentialing data if it is all destroyed in a fire
(such things occasionally happen) we have to assume that any uncredentialled
individual can replace Bob's credentialing data in the same way, be he Bob,
Fred or Frank.  All credential systems are dependent on the initial
authentication's validity.  That is why identity fraud, credit application
fraud and the like work.  No national ID system, or any ID system, will every
fully, or even mostly, remove such fraud.
The Changing Meaning of 911.
The disadvantage of all this is that all privacy seekers will begin to look
more and more like felons- or worse, terrorists.  Encrypted mail will be a
branding thing to have in your inbox.  Neighbors are encouraged to inform on
their associates.  Strangers are urged to be "vigilant" (suspiciously close to
'vigilante in my view) in reporting "suspicious activity" which is, of course,
not defined.  The threshold for invoking "911" (that's September 11th for the
irony impaired) has been pretty seriously reduced now.  Terrorism has gripped
the United States so successfully that most of my friends and associates have
been heard to comment that things will "never be the same."  I tend to think
they are right.  I tend to think this is most unfortunate.  I tend to think it
was inevitable.
Perhaps we will find that widespread freedom, in the form that we aspire to
create it, isn't a sustainable social form in the United States.  Prosperity
and freedom in their current guise in the United States seem to be subject to
the whim of short term thinking.  Though I realize this isn't how Platt meant
it: "stupidity trumps intelligence."  Not only the stupidity of terrorists- in
fact I think these terrorists were astoundingly intelligent- but the stupidity
of the citizenry.  Perhaps the United States is not indeed mature enough- or
perhaps _no longer_ mature enough- on the whole to "...pay any price, bear any
burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the
survival and the success of liberty."
Margaret Thatcher once commented, on the close of the Gulf War:  "Now, just
look, there is the aggressor, Saddam Hussein, still in power.  There is the
President of the United States, no longer in power. There is the Prime
Minister of Britain who did quite a lot to get things there, no longer in
power. I wonder who won?"
I do hope we don't come to reflect on the perpetrators of September 11th in
the same fashion.
What Remains to be Done.
If we assume that things are only going to get worse as technology progresses
and progressively puts more and more power into the hands of fewer and fewer
individuals we probably also have to assume that WTC is not the largest or
most impressive terrorist or asymmetric attack we will see in the next decade.
We might also assume that the many proposals out there today will not solve
the problem- much as metal detectors at airports did not.  Much as identity
requirements for boarding planes did not.  Much as... well you get the idea.
I suspect that those two things- which seem a little bit obvious to me- might
also mean that governments will increasingly seek to adopt more and more
intrusive measures to appear to give their citizens the impression of
What can we do to foster privacy and preserve crypto even in the face of these
potential (but uncertain) changes?
I used to write a little bit at the end of every year on this point.  What
more could we do to further cryptographic development?  To increase privacy?
I stopped bothering at some point but I recently came across these points from
a post I wrote back in 1996:
begin quote
A.  Increasing the ease of use.
Perhaps I should have put this as  because really among those things
which I suggest in this post, I think this is of primary importance.  It
cannot be stressed enough that encryption must be transparent, easy to
use, but at the same time make its presence just apparent enough to
encourage its use, and to make users note its absence.
B.  Multiple encryption method support/larger key sizes.
While I may be more paranoid than some, or even most, I think it is
crucial to provide for the possibility that strong encryption may one day
face a total ban in more countries.  To avoid the chilling effect that
this would certainly have on development, it is of key importance to
permit applications and implementations to nexus with several methods, and
to allow what may today seem like extrodinarily large key sizes.  (256
bits would not be unreasonable in my view, particularly so where the user
was given the option of selecting a ~128 or so bit method like IDEA or
3DES at their option (consistent with A. above).
C.  Anonymous communication.
I'm not sure this needs much explanation.
D.  True stego.
Today it is a simple matter to identify encrypted traffic.  This is the
key flaw in what I will call (at risk of sounding like a white paper) the
NEI (National Encryption Infrastructure).  It subjects users to very
effective and easy to implement traffic analysis.  While I understand the
temptation to use checksum like methods to speed the key checking process,
at some point I am of the view that this convenience will come back to
haunt crypto.
end quote
Well, two of these and maybe three are at least somewhat better 5 years later.
Good job c'punks.
I don't really know what the state of true stego is today, but I submit that
it better get a whole lot better in a big hurry.  Anyone have any comments
about the viability of real stego against concerted state-sponsored fishing
expeditions on usenet or elsewhere?  What stego applications are out there?
Are they any good?  Has anyone developed specifications for stego which make
sense?  Have these been implemented?
Anonymous communication?  Remailers seem to be at least of passing
functionality.  I think they will come under increasing scrutiny in the months
and years to come.  At risk of causing a flame war: Happy Fun Homeland Defense
Organization is not amused.  More remailers in jurisdictions with foreign
policy goals too boring to offend this or that religion or political ambition.
Middleman only remailers in those jurisdictions at greater risk of considering
oppressive changes in laws or enforcement.
What ever happened to Stealth PGP?  "The first rule of not being seen- not to
stand up."  At least if one is using encryption it would be nice to be able to
deter key-based traffic analysis.  Surely this will increasingly be a problem.
(Nice to see Earthlink refusing to install Carnivore, but can all ISPs say the
same?  Without a doubt Earthlink was not the only one approached).
Personally, I'd be willing to drop some coin if it will help foster a strong,
open source, multi-platform utility to Stealthify and Stego PGP messages while
it's still legal to do so.  What's out there to start work with.  Would anyone
else contribute?
If everyone is going to dial 911 at the drop of a hat what do we plan to do
about it?

I appreciate your concern.
I'm not sure which community you refer to.  If you mean DCSB, I'm not a member
of that mailing list currently, but I also don't post to it.  (Mr. Hettinga
forwarded my post without my knowledge).  If you mean the United States, I
have resided in the US for at least 188 days a year for the last 10 or so
The United States is quite myopic.  No two ways about it.  I'm not sure how an
argument can credibly be made otherwise in general and making one today merely
affirms your orbit within the new economy reality distortion field (with
apologies to Steve Jobs).  As for jingoistic, (for those readers who were
overly impressed with Mr. Hutchinson's use of vocabulary: "extreme chauvinism
or nationalism marked especially by a belligerent foreign policy") I have no
idea how you could argue otherwise in the eve of the new air and land war
brewing in Asia at US behest.  As for stupid- I merely submit to you that the
average IQ in the United States hovers around 90.  (Look it up).  There is a
reason the phrase "No one ever lost money underestimating the intelligence of
the American People" was coined.  I don't know if that meets the common
definition of "stupid," I for one quite enjoy most Americans I meet, but them
I'm fairly selective about the company I keep and I avoid West Virginia.  As
for your last clause however, it is true that regardless of how intelligent,
or non intelligent, the United States is you (or I) can't do much about it.
Despite all this I live in the US by choice.  Though I find myself
reconsidering this situation on a regular basis sometimes, lately I've given
it the most serious rethinking I can recall.  Bandwagonism is awfully
dangerous in an environment of hyper-nationalism, and unless the leaders of
the band can properly channel the hype they whip up... well, things get ugly.
See, Hitler was smart.  He whipped up and used the Brownshirts and then killed
most of them or sent them to fight foreign wars.  Hard to do such a thing in
the U.S.  They might just go beating up anyone with fabric on their head.  (I
heard that a pair of Mexican Americans were killed by a small mob in a West
Chicago suburb the other day.  Apparently there was chanting of "Go back to
Allah" by the peanut gallery).
Going back through history you might find that 225 years is not an impressive
number.  As we Europeans are fond of saying "In Europe 100 miles is a long
way.  In the United States 100 years is a long time."  Yes, you are all
impassioned, invigorated, alive and very cowboyesque.  I find that most
charming.  All of us 'fur-in-ers' do.  Your great for us to find a place park
our generations old money in equity investments and see a return better than
e.g. the Swiss Franc.  That's your strength.  Unfettered optimism and
initiative.  That's why, despite many tries, venture capital markets never
work well in the United States.  Plus, you have filmmaking down to a cookie
cutter science.  We love watching your films, and those of us without that
much of an attitude don't even mind that they are all in English.  (Have you
ever enjoyed a firm in German?  I didn't think so.  The best one ever made,
"M," was silent).
I think anyone who calls the United States the world leader in the
instantiation of "such freedoms" in the face of the legislative and
administrative initiatives currently on the horizon- and those which have
passed in the last 50 years- is being a bit silly.  I suppose though that
being as close to the problems as you are, your mileage may vary.  In
actuality, the United States might well be the world leader in removal of
freedoms.  For while it may be true that the U.S. was at one time the freest
country in the world, the dip from that high water mark of democracy to today
might also mark the largest loss of freedoms ever.  (Perhaps you will want to
study this.  It would make an interesting thesis).  Most other 1st or 2nd
world cultures never made it very high on the freedom bar- having effectively
come directly from Feudalism to a sort of socialist (or outright communist)
form of governance.
According to the Supreme Court, which the last time I checked was the highest
authority on such matters, in the 14th and 4th Amendments.  See e.g. William
Kolender, et al., Petitioner, v. Edward Lawson. (461 U.S. 352), Terry v. Ohio,
(392 U.S. 1), Lewis v. City of New Orleans , 415 U.S. 130.
Really, you should look some of this up before you spout off.  Secret trials
and hidden evidence are the order of the day not just in FISA but also in
sealed warrants and affidavits, veiled testimony, etc. etc. of normal civil
and criminal trials.  You clearly don't live in California if you believe the
firearms nonsense and you clearly haven't been forced to testify about the
location or presence of incriminating papers in a white collar crime
investigation if you believe in the power of the prohibition against
self-incrimination.  As for being told what to say or think?  Don't walk
around with a bin laden tattoo on, or you're be arrested.  Don't think that
you hate blacks in the commission of a felony or your guilt of a hate
(thought) crime.  All of those things you seem to hold dear have been slowly
eroded over time, dear friend.  The only two exceptions in discussion are the
religious bit (which has been mostly fended off to my way of thinking) and
identification- which despite all your claims is not a legally mandated thing
for anyone to carry around.  That you do not know any of this seals my
argument from the very beginning.  Myopic?  Indeed.
Have you ever been to Liechtenstein?  Given your implication above I have to
think not.  Have you banked there?  Clearly not.  Liechtenstein banks don't
insist on performing a credit check before giving you account.  (Your money is
sufficient).  Liechtenstein banks tellers don't fall for petty "social
engineering" ploys to discover the identity of depositors.  Liechtenstein
bankers don't ask you about how your life is, how your kids are, how your
business is going or how you voted in the last election.  (Questions I have
all heard asked of me from bankers in the U.S.).  See, these things are not
regarded as private in the United States.  Refusing to answer such questions
is cause for suspicion and scorn.  (And from a banker in the U.S. even a
"Suspicious Transaction Report").  These questions are simply never asked in
Liechtenstein because it is understood that it is none of anyone's business.
Further, the Constitution of Liechtenstein directly assures such privacy- more
than I can say for the Untied States.  The Constitution provides directly for
personal liberty and for the inviolability of the home, postal correspondence,
and telephone conversations.  All of these are only vaguely protected in the
United States, and the only penality is that the evidence so gathered cannot
be used in a court of law.  Jail terms enforce such laws in Liechtenstein.
Moreover, statutes like the law on persons and corporations provide for
specific codification of privacy of a kind that hasn't ever been dreampt of in
the United States.  (And thinking back a moment, wasn't it you just a
paragraph ago who commented that the United States didn't provide for
anonyminity?  Suddenly now it's the center of privacy jurisprudence for the
In so far as a square and a rectangle aren't the same thing, I may agree.  But
squares are rectangles.  Privacy is a larger namespace than anonymity, but the
two are encompassed.  Failing to recognize their connection is literary
fiction made for the sake of your argument, I suspect.
This is relevant how?
As long as you're not in the United States, where such anonminity is
constantly challenged, and breached.  I won't even bother to list the dozens
of examples of ISPs giving over such names to e.g., the Scientologists etc.
And there you show your American red, white and blue colors.  See, if you
moved next to me in Liechtenstein, no such questions would arise.  Such
questions are not asked.  And again, you appear to be short of memory, wasn't

I remember that.  Oh, yes, here it is:

there is some kind of duty to pry for the "good of the community."  I think
that pretty clearly defines the differences between us.  You see, I don't
believe the Stasi fostered the kind of society I believe people should aspire
to create.  Clearly, your view is different.
Also, practice spelling with me:  Liechtenstein.
I think your donning of the flame suit is the only real argument I need to
make against the bunk above, wherein you first claim that security measures
are vulnerable to social engineering, but then claim that more security
measures will be more effective.
Complete fiction.
Paper cash is an age old tool for anonymous transactions.  Go back to the
French revolution and note the sudden drop in letters of credit, retentes and
other financial instruments by French royalty in favor of cash, gold,
gemstone, silver and other bearer transactions.  Go back farther to the
Chinese "flying money" systems or to chop systems to see that paper money was
used there to avoid confiscatory taxes and provide for anonymous transactions.
Again, your cross section of history seems to be all of about 25 years old.
As for aberrant?  I'll leave this as an exercise for the reader.  What
percentage of daily transactions in the world are on a cash basis?  And in the
United States?
Are you sure?  Did the corner shopkeeper tell his wife?  His lover?  How do we
know?  See, the difference in our respective approaches is that I don't depend
on others to safeguard my privacy, be they governmental others, officers
others at financial institutions or community member others (nosey neighbors).
I don't believe in systems which rely on the "honor" of the human race.  I've
been around to long to believe in the tooth fairy too.  To believe that urge
is a predominant one in today's human psyche is to ignore reality.  The level
of willful ignorance required to perpetuate that belief is astounding to me,
and then again, it isn't.
I don't know how to explain this view to others aside the shrugging suggestion
that perhaps you feel "American" is the only culture of note to see the light
of day in the last 4000 years.  (Hint: The Chinese were carving chop blocks
for anonymous transactions back in 1200 B.C. when I suspect your (and I know
my) ancestors were busy hitting each other over the head with big sticks and
living in mud huts.  See above.
Yep.  Sorry this disappointed you.  I think it says more about your approach
than I ever could.
Just out of curiosity, which other "rights" or "wants" do you feel shouldn't
be absolute?  Freedom of speech?  Freedom of movement?  Freedom of thought?
Freedom from search or seizure?
Depends what country you are in.  I understand it's indefensible in the United
States right now (though the ACLU might disagree).  The rest of the world is
somewhat less bull-headed about it all.
Foolish boy.

@_subject: When prisoners of war aren't even close. (Was: RE: Rogue terror state violates Geneva Convention) 
I've been quite amused to watch all the wrangling about the "Geneva
Convention" with respect to captives held by the United States in relation
to the events of September 11th- both here and in the media.
First of all, no one seems to bother specifying which "Geneva Convention"
they are referring to.  (Several agreements between states would apply.  I
assume that what is meant is the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment
of Prisoners of War.
I don't believe any of the captives apply to this definition, or any of the
other protections generally referred to as the "Geneva Convention" for
several reasons.
Let's review some of the assertions made by mattd (who I had ploinked but so
many morons here are apt to quote him that there seems to be no escape) and
Where do you see this?  Let's look at the language of the Convention,
instead of the Fox News bullet points, shall we?
The Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War was
Adopted on 12 August 1949 by the Diplomatic Conference for the Establishment
of International Conventions for the Protection of Victims of War, held in
Geneva from April to August, 1949.  (The "Third Convention")
It entered into force for the then signatories on October 21, 1950.
Article 2
"In addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peace time, the
present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other
armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting
Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them."
I'm afraid al Qaeda is not a high contracting party.  A state of war does
not exist in the United States, as congress has no so declared.  Well, can
we get it in somewhere else?
"The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation
of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation
meets with no armed resistance."
Since no international body I am aware of recognizes that al Qaeda has any
territory to occupy I think that is out.  I suppose one might pretend that
the United States is "occupying" Afghanistan, but given that the Americans
are outnumbered by some thousands to one in ratio I kind of doubt this will
"Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present
Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in
their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in
relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions
Specifically, if three parties are "in conflict" and one is not a signatory,
the remaining two powers shall abide by the Convention with respect to each
other.  They shall also abide by it with respect to the non-signatory,
provided that non-signatory accepts and applies the provisions of the
Convention.  Anyone want to who try and tell me that al Qaeda "accepts and
applies the provisions of the Convention?"
Even if it were al Qaeda members do not fall into the definition of
"protected persons" or "prisoners of war" as defined by the Third
Convention.  It's pretty specific in Article 4:
"Article 4
A. Prisoners of war, in the sense of the present Convention, are persons
belonging to one of the following categories, who have fallen into the power
of the enemy:
1. Members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict as well as members
of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces."
Nope.  Al Qaeda is a group of diverse nationalities.  They are not members
of any particular armed forces.  Even if we believe they are an armed force
of their own right, they are not a Party to the convention.
"2. Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps,
including those of organized resistance movements..."
Oh wait!  Wait!
"...belonging to a Party to the conflict..."
Damn.  Nope.  Well, maybe if we really stretch things...
"...and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this territory
is occupied, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such
organized resistance movements, fulfill the following conditions:
(a) That of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates..."
Sure, sure, thank you Osama...
"...(b) That of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a
Well, maybe we can fudge this.
"...(c) That of carrying arms openly..."
Yep, that's easy.
"...(d) That of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and
customs of war..."
Oops.  Well, maybe we can look the other way on this one?
If you're going to make legal arguments, use legal definitions.  Finding the
definition that applies to the Conventions is left as an exercise for the
reader.  (Hint: It's not in dictionary.com).
Oh boy.  Medication time.  Medication time.  I do so love when people quote
what they think is chapter and verse only to totally disregard it when its
convenient to the argument to do so.  Reader Exercise   Are the victims
of the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks "non-combatants" for the
purposes of the convention?  Reader Exercise  Why doesn't it make any
[Noise about the US being a criminal association deleted]
See above.
It most certainly is not.
Bush can declare whatever he likes to the press.  Only congress can declare
war for the purposes of the Convention.
Now I'm getting sleepy.  Blather tires me eventually.
Final student exercises:  Why don't the Geneva Convention relative to the
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (The Fourth Convention) or the
Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of August 1949, and relating
to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol 1)
apply to the captives either?

What you are asking about (at Tort in any event) is the legal doctrine of
respondeat superior ("let the master answer") making the "master" liable for
certain acts of the "servant."  An employer is therefore typically liable
for injury to person or property resulting from acts of an employee (See
Generally, Black's Law Dictionary).
There are lots of parallel ways to impose criminal liability in the same
fashion.  The government's favorite is generally the rather notorious
concept of "conspiracy."

@_subject: Anonymity of prepaid phone chip-cards 
Nichols was dumb enough to actually be caught in possession of a card used
in at last part of the conspiracy.
Other cards that seem to be linked to Nichols were used to locate or obtain
ANFO and call the rental agency for the Ryder truck as well as other numbers
linked to the crime.
That is public knowledge at this point.  Clearly, logs are available to law
enforcement vis-a-vis pre-paid calling cards when they wish to use them.
Given the time between the bombing and the capture of at least one of the
cards (3-4 days) I suspect those logs are available for at least a few days.
Given that the prosecutors claim to be able to link the ANFO purchase via
calling cards it is probably a lot longer.
What is confusing are the reports that the calling card (or one of them)
"bore the name Daryl Bridges."  Pre-paid cards don't have names imprinted on
them.  They would have to have a spot to write them in deliberately.  I
haven't seen this on any and why would anyone (particularly as part of a
criminal conspiracy) do such a thing?
Keeping calling cards from leaking information probably isn't possible.
Limiting the information leaked to that which is already known or is useless
is probably the best bet.   Using separate cards for separate operations /
cells and immediate disposal seems pretty critical.
Note something else, however.  I haven't heard of any instances of real time
calling card interception.  One was described here on the list but that
presupposes that a degree of surveillance already exists around the subject.
All bets are pretty much off in that event.  Calling cards are "after the
fact" evidence, not preventative evidence.
