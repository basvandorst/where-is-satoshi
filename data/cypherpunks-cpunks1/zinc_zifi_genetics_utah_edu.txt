@_subject: 64 bit keys breakable by the NSA or just some random key length? 
i was thinking about the recent Clinton/LEA proposal regarding exportable crypto.  the new rules would allow 64 bit keys to be exported, as long
as the master key was made available through some key escrow service.
now, we know it is relatively easy to break a 40 bit key.
additionally, we know it is nearly impossible to break 128 bits.  i'm
not so sure how hard 64 bits is (need to brush up on that ol'
mathematics some time...).
why did the govt pick 64 bits?  is this length still within the range
of the NSA if they really wanted to read something but didn't feel the
need or want the exposure of obtaining a key from escrow?
i'm curious if anyone thinks this gives us a little more info on the
capabilities of the NSA regarding brute forcing a key.  additionally,
since this *is* an escrow system, why didn't the gov't just go with
the unbreakable 128 bit key length?  - -pjf

@_subject: Costs of Credit Card Fraud and Brute-Force Codebreaking 
time is not money if you're a high school student with nothing else to do.  time is not money if you're a grad student.  i spend approx 14 hrs or more a day in the lab seven days a week.  there's no way my stipend adds up to anything close to minimum wage at that rate.  the value of time is subjective.  if i had a wife and a couple of kids AND i was a grad student, my time would be worth more.  as it is, my time is not worth a whole lot.
you're assessment that this cost our anon friend some money to obtain these cc numbers is simply not true.  when you have nothing else to do, choosing one thing over another involves no cost.  if anything, he made money by using the cc numbers to make long dist calls instead of using any cash he might have from working or an allowance.

@_subject: Auto-pgp for pine/elm/tin (fwd) 
the risks etc of using pgp on a multiuser platforms are well known. i'd say it's better to have a pgp signed mesg than an unsigned one.
if you post a lot, or mail a lot, that's a lot of mesgs to sign.
finding a tool to do this more easily than using pgp through the shell
interface is 'a good thing'.
given that, here are some args for signing on a multiuser platform.
often, people (me included) choose to use a separate 'weak' key for these purposes.  it's always nice to have some sort of indication that that is what the key is for.  i had a key with 'INSECURE KEY!!' tagged on the end of my userid.  i had another for secure communications.
now, you can't stop some sysop type person from doing whatever to you.
that's the way it goes.  but, if you've got a really malicious sysop,
they could just spoof you to the world, including making up a key
supposedly from you.  if they posted enough crap using that key people
would begin to think that they are really you or that one of you is
lying and to hell with both of you.  this sort of denial of service
attack is an unlikely event (unlikely for a sysop to do - someone else
is a diff matter).
finally, independent of multiuser platforms, the signing utilities are
quite useful for people like me who have their own personal unix box
on the net.

folks, say yes to proof reading.
sorry to perpetuate this thread any more but as one of the resident
biochemists/mol biologists i've got an itch to scratch.
in the lines with the single '>' above, you need to replace the word
'exon' with 'intron'.
    exons --> DNA sequences in a gene that (can) yield protein after splicing
    introns --> DNA sequences that are interspersed between exons in a gene
introns have several known roles, including roles in RNA splicing and
RNA editing (a process that sort of skirts the central dogma of DNA -> RNA -> protein by changing the 'code' in the RNA).
non-coding sequences represent the bulk of DNA, and for the most part
it's role is unknown although various people have their pet theories.
gene regulation is often carried out by non-coding sequences,
including sequences that are never transcribed into RNA.  thus, they
can be involved in any cancer process.

the Type I remailer is Matt Ghio's code.  all commands are supported

the pgp key for the remailer is included in the message below.  in

I have an automated mail handling program installed here which will take
any message with the proper headers and automatically re-send it anonymously.
You can use this by sending a message to mix at zifi.genetics.utah.edu, with the
header Anon-To: containing the address that you want to send anonymously to.
(Only one recipient address is permitted.)  If you can't add headers to your
mail, you can place two colons on the first line of your message, followed
by the Anon-To line.  Follow that with a blank line, and then begin your
message.  For Example:
The above would be delivered to beth at univ.edu anonymously.  All headers in
the original message are removed, with the exception of the Subject (and
Content-Type, if present).  She would not know that it came from Joe, nor
would she be able to reply to the message.
However, if Beth suspected that Joe had sent the message, she could compare
the time that the message was received with the times that Joe was logged
in.  However, this problem can be avoided by instructing the remailer to
delay the message, by using the Latent-Time header:
The above message would be delayed one hour from when it is sent.  It is also
possible to create a random delay by adding an r to the time (ie +1:00r),
which would have the message be delivered at a random time, but not more
than an hour.
Another problem is that some mailers automatically insert a signature file.
Of course, this usually contains the senders email address, and so would
reveal their identity.  The remailer software can be instructed to remove
a signature file with the header "Cutmarks".  Any line beginning with the
same text at in the cutmarks header, and any lines following it will be
You can add additional headers to the output message by preceeding them
with By seperating messages with cutmarks, you can send more than one message
at once:
The two messages will be delivered seperately.
For added security, you can encrypt your messages to the remailer with PGP.
The remailer software will decrypt the message and send it on.  Here is the
remailer's public key:

one way to prevent this sort of spamming is to put a cap on the number

exception will have to be made for instances of chaining so that the
number of messages allowed to be forwarded to another remailer is not

i was thinking about the whole PRZ thing last night and especially about our lack of information.  One of the best things that could happen is to get some or all of the members of the grand jury on the net and subscribed to the CP list so we could ask questions.
If they just had e-mail we could submit questions to them and ask that they reply to the whole list.
In this vein, it would be nice if someone (c2??) would offer dialup access for any members of the grand jury who wanted it.
i would be happy to offer shell accts to any member so they could enlighten us about the mysterious ways of the TLAs.  Unfortunately, they would need to obtain telnet access for this.
Is there any way we could offer these accts to them?  i suppose their
names are not known so this is obviously a problem and it wouldn't
speak well of the cypherpunks to go violating someones privacy just so
we could ask them to explain the government to us.
Just some thoughts...

how can it be jury tampering if the jury has been disbanded?  i did not mean to influence an active grand jury, but to ask questions
of one that had finished it's job.

i have to agree.  there is a huge difference in telling someone that
they're breaking the law and supporting a law.
as far as i'm concerned, on cypherpunks we try to disect laws or
regulations so that we can chip away at weaknesses in them.  it is
also useful if one wants to determine how your oppenent is going to
react when you do something; know your enemy and all that.

@_subject: FV Demonstrates Fatal Flaw in Software Encryption of Credit Cards 
howdy folks,
so what?  fv has a keyboard sniffer...
if you're going to d/l programs from the net and not pay attention to what's going on you'll always be at risk and a fool as well.
for what it's worth, this sort of program could easily be used to get info more important than credit card numbers.  passphrases and passwords of all kinds could be obtained leading to broken accts or worthless cryptography.
additionally, this hardly has anything to do with netscape.  this is not a 'bug' in netscape.  it's a malicious program.  the only way to prevent malicious programs from causing you problems is to know what your computer is doing; what it's loading when you boot and what data it sends through your phone lines when you're online.

this program is not specific to credit card numbers.  it sounds like
it could have just as easily been written to watch for a login: or
password: prompt and then record everything entered after that.
the point is not that this can be done, the point is that users need
tools that would check for programs like this running on their
system.  is fv making a 'fix' available?  i would imagine a  'fix'
would be a program that would look for tsr type programs (or inits on
a mac) that do this sort of thing.  this is the sort of thing that crypto can help with.  there should be
a site that PGP signs the programs available from their site.  these
signed programs will have been testing on the appropriate system and
verified to be free of small malicious programs such as the one you
describe.  alternatively, the author themselves could PGP sign the app
(this is already done) and this would be what users should d/l.
it's disapointing to see the spin put on this by fv.  instead of
going with scare tactics, they could encourage PGP signatures and suggest
solutions to this problem like the ones i mentioned above.  in fact,
fv could even volunteer to help set up a site where all software has
been tested and signed by someone who has had their PGP key signed by
fv, sort of an expansion of the web of trust.

this particular paragraph certainly brought some ideas to my head: talk about an opportunity for sniffing data off someone or just
pouring your data own into their 'personal network'.  this is the
'denial of existence' attack - the computer cannot talk to you - you
don't exist...
