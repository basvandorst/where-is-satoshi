This seems counterproductive. PGP should not be portrayed as a tool  for those that most Americans consider antisocial.

I happen to like SOF, and I don't think most Americans have a bad  opinion of it (certainly some do, but that is true of any  publication). But SOF's appeal is much broader than just "mercs and  wannabees" [Sandy's words], and that "mercs and wannabees" is  probably the subfocus of SOF that most Americans find the least  tasteful of what SOF is about. Most Americans don't think highly of  mercenaries. If anyone is going write something for SOF about PGP, I  hope that the article focuses on anything but "mercs and wannabees".

A quote from pgpdoc1.doc:
 "If privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will have privacy.        agencies have access to good cryptographic technology.  So do  the big
     arms and drug traffickers.  So do defense contractors, oil       and other corporate giants.  But ordinary people and grassroots
     political organizations mostly have not had access to affordable
     "military grade" public-key cryptographic technology.  Until  Now Phil wrote PGP in part so that "grassroots" political  organizations could have strong crypto.  SOF is a "grassroots political  organization."  It happens that some people don't like SOF.  It happens that some  other people think that the organizations that Phil was thinking of when he wrote PGP are unamerican communist front organizations who should be  on the Attorney General's List (if we still had an Attorney General's List)(if we still had an Attorney General).  Tastes differ.
The point of cypherpunks is that everyone (even FBI agents) should  have strong crypto if they want it.
I know that Phil feels a personal sense of embarrassment at being  adopted by all sorts of nut groups (including ourselves) and he has pleaded  for stories of "worthy PGP use."  Standards of worthiness will vary.
DCF   Who, as it happens, *is* a member of an organization on the Attorney General's list.

I'm normally in California, but will be in Washington City the 25th  through the 27th, and then in Houston the 28th and 29th (of January).  My key has been signed by Castor Fu, whose key was signed by Phil  Zimmerman. I would be happy to meet with anyone in Washington or  Houston to sign keys. Anyone who is interested should feel free to  email me.

@_subject: Barriers to offshore banking 
They may be user hostile, but they are not necessarily risky. And the  middle class uses offshore banks a great deal. Offshore means any  bank outside the US. Swiss banks are quite reliable, though they  occasionally provide information to the US government and they  withhold taxes on interest earned. Austrian banks are just as  reliable and offer not just numbered accounts, but password  protected, numbered accounts, and do not tax interest earned. There  are many other places with reliable banks that will protect one's  privacy. The Channel Islands have a system of government that dates  to 1066, numbered bank accounts, and the largest bank on the Islands  is the tenth largest bank in the world.
That's why most people use faxes to communicate with offshore banks.  I would be surprised if email didn't follow soon.
In a few jurisdictions, this is true. For example all that is  required to set up a bank in Grenada is to form a corporation with  the word "Bank" in the name. That's it! No regulations at all. Most  jurisdictions in which offshore banking take place regulate several  different types of banks. Class A banks are the type one finds in the  US, with tellers, etc. Class B banks are typically run by a company  which sets up the bank and are almost always prohibited from doing  any business with the local residents. Class B banks are usually  divided into restricted and unrestricted. An unrestricted bank can do  business with anyone not a resident of the country in which the bank  exists, while a restricted bank can do business only with parties  named at the time the bank is formed. Reserve and capitalization  requirement vary from country to country but unrestricted banks must  nearly always meet tougher requirements than restricted banks, and  Class A banks must meet tougher requirements than Class B banks. For  example, in the Bahamas, a restricted Class B bank must have a  minimum capitalization of $100,000 and pay an annual license fee of  $5000. For an unrestricted Class B bank, it is $1,000,000 and $25,000  respectively. I don't have figures available for a Class A bank but  they are much higher and the Class A bank would be subject to  It's not that hard to find. Many offshore banks are more than 100  years old.
True but misleading. The typical offshore bank customer spends about  $1000 to $2000 to set up a corporation, so that the bank acount is  not in his own name. This obviates the requirement to tell the IRS  when an American opens a bank account in a foreign country.
If that were true, there wouldn't be offshore banks. The tax savings  probably outweigh the legal fees by 10 to 1 or more in most cases,  and fraud exists, but is not so rapant that people stay away.

Project Guttenberg has only books that are in the public domain e.g.  very old books. I suspect that Bruce Schneier (and the publisher)  would like people to buy Applied Cryptography. I found it to be worth  the price.

Does anyone know if Project Guttenberg(or anyone else) has electronic  such as applied cryptography?
