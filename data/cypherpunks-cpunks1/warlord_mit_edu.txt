Please attend if you have any interest in this topic...
To get to MIT, room 1-115:
via car: have fun!  Building 1 is located right on Mass Ave., close
to Memorial Drive.  You can try to park anywhere around the area, if
you can find a spot.
via T: get off at kendall sq. (red line), and walk west... cross Ames
St., and keep walking west.  Enter the infinite corridor when you
cannot walk outside any further, and keep walking west.
Once you get into Lobby 7 (a big cathedral-like entryway at 77 Mass.

@_subject: How long would it take? 
There are a number of ways to attack a PGP (or PEM) encrypted
document.  The first, and most likely easiest, is to try to get
someone's private key.  Other attacks include attacks on IDEA (128-bit
keys) or RSA.
Its unclear what any of these attacks require, at this point.
Breaking IDEA would take a brute force attack (2^128 keys) unless
something better comes up.  Breaking RSA requires factoring the
modulus, unless something easier comes up.
I would expect that the time to factor a 1200bit modulus would be on
the order of a million years or more, even given technology upgreades
of the near-future.
I've seen a number-of-addition-bits to amount-of-extra-time-to-factor
ratio, but I don't remember what it is.  (order of magnitude per 10
decimal digits, maybe????)
Comments, suggestions, corrections, all welcome.

No, DH is useful whenever you want to generate a session key between
two entities, and its even more useful because it doesn't require any
prior knowledge.  This means that you don't *need* to verify the
identity of the other person.  However, without some way of verifying the key of the other party,
there is no easy way to detect a monkey-in-the-middle attack.  As was
put forward, a combination of DH to key exchange and RSA to detect
monkey-in-the-middle will protect you, but you lose your anonymity at
that point.
So, to return to your question, DH is useful even when you have a
method of verification.  So the answer to your question is yes, you
are wrong.

A new paper on electronic currency to appear in the 1st ACM Conference on
Computer and Communications Security, Nov. 93 is now available via anonymous
FTP from PROSPERO.ISI.EDU as /pub/papers/security/netcash-cccs93.ps.Z
NetCash: A design for practical electronic currency on the Internet  Gennady Medvinsky and Clifford Neuman
NetCash is a framework that supports realtime electronic payments with
provision of anonymity over an unsecure network.  It is designed to enable new
types of services on the Internet which have not been practical to date
because of the absence of a secure, scalable, potentially anonymous payment
NetCash strikes a balance between unconditionally anonymous electronic
currency, and signed instruments analogous to checks that are more scalable
but identify the principals in a transaction.  It does this by providing the
framework within which proposed electronic currency protocols can be
integrated with the scalable, but non-anonymous, electronic banking
infrastructure that has been proposed for routine transactions.

Newsgroups tend to have a lot smaller S/N ratio, in general, than

think its always been a lot better than many of the better newsgroups.
Making cypherpunks a newsgroup will just lower the S/N ratio without

and from what I've heard from other sources, ViaCrypt has a license
with PKP for their RSA engine software.  As such, ViaCrypt can do
anything they want with that software.
So, ViaCrypt replaced the RSA engine in PGP with their own, licensed
RSA engine.  As far as PKP is concerned, ViaCrypt can do this, and
PKP can't say anything.  As to whether or not there are other problems
with PGP, well, I won't comment on that.
If you own ViaCrypt PGP, you have a fully licensed program, and PKP

The fact that you have nested messages doesn't matter, since the
remailer, in theory, only opens the outermost envelope (The fact that
it finds another envelope and not some plain-text message shouldn't
matter to the remailer).
Also, depending on the kind and speed of the machine, and how much
mail it is going to get should affect the size of the key.

@_subject: Newbie comments. 
That is the point of encrypted, anonymous remailers.  Since the
message is encrypted, it looks like a random set of bits.  If it gets
re-encrypted at every stage, then the remailers can add random bits of
data to change the size.  They already change the headers.
So, the only thing left to worry about is a FIFO problem.  But that
is easily solved.
So, here is what happens:
  A message comes into a remailer (actually, a bunch of messages do,
but that's not important).  It comes in encrypted, so you can't read
the message.  The headers are stripped off in the remailer and the
message is re-encrypted, so the data changes.  If it gets stored an
arbistrary length of time, and the outgoing order is different than
the incoming order, than there is no way to figure out which message
came from or went to where.
There is a lot more to this, and a lot of other problems that need to
be solved, but this is it in a nutshell.
I hope it answers your question.  I'm sure people will correct any
mistakes I inadvertantly left in.

@_subject: possible solution to the anonymous harrassment problem 
Uhh, this is not quite true.  If you read closer, you will see that
you need "special permission from RSADSI" to use non-published
interfaces to RSAREF.  At the end is an exerpt from the RSAREF
documentation about its interface.  If you want more functionality,
you have to ask special permission!
This means that without this permission, you CANNOT use "RSA
encryption" in-and-of itself.
---------- begin exerpt --------------
RSAREF is written entirely in C. Its application interface includes
the following routines:
      R_SignPEMBlock     computes a digital signature on a message
R_VerifyPEMSignature     verifies a digital signature on a message
R_VerifyBlockSignature   verifies a digital signature on a block of
                           data such as a certificate
      R_SealPEMBlock     computes a digital signature and encrypts a
                           message
      R_OpenPEMBlock     decrypts an encrypted message and verifies a
                           digital signature
       R_DigestBlock     computes a message digest on a message
   R_GeneratePEMKeys     generates an RSA public/private key pair
        R_RandomInit     initializes a random structure
      R_RandomUpdate     mixes bytes into a random structure
R_GetRandomBytesNeeded   computes the number of mix-in bytes still
                           needed to seed a random structure
       R_RandomFinal     zeroizes a random structure

In this thesis, I describe extensions to the Kerberos Authentication
System to enable a secure method of Authentication over multiple
networks.  Kerberos was designed with a fully-connected IP network in
mind, however when you add dialup capabilities to the picture,
Kerberos doesn't expand to secure the whole connection.
Charon was created to tackle this problem.  It was developed to
provide a way to securely authenticate to a login server over a modem
connection, without allowing a passive attacker to gain enough
information to impersonate the user.  This means that a user can log
into a Kerberized host without typing his password in clear-text over
the phone.  In addition, no modifications to the login server's base
operating system need to be made in order to accomplish this.

@_subject: Key Servers 
This defeats the purpose for which the PGP Keyservers were created.
The Keyservers were created to give a *SINGLE* place where you could
go to request a PGP key for some name (and it doesn't matter whether
that name is real or not).
Having a keyserver "dedicated only to real identities" would violate
the basis for which the Keyservers were originally created.  Also,
quite recently, the keyserver administrators were discussing new
Keyserver sites, and we all agreed that ALL Keyserver sites would be
interconnected, to make sure that anyone could get any key from any
Keyserver site, no matter which server they use.
By proposing a split in the Keyserver service, you propose breaking
the initial assumption under which the keyservers were created:
Everyone has access to the whole public keyring from any server.
Oh, I'm not saying that this is impossible.  It is possible.  It is,
however, unlikely that anyone will, and I personally will oppose any
such move to provide a service such as this.  It is not the job of the
Keyserver to decide whether a key blongs to a real person or not.  The
job of the Keyserver is to provide keys.  All keys.  Any keys.  No
matter who claims to own the key.
The job to decide if a key was a True Name as its owner is a matter
for signators.  Thats what Public Key Signatures are all about!  If
you create some kind of Notary Hierarchy to require two pieces of
picture identification, two major credit cards, and a note from your
mother, then you can guarantee that that is a True Name (assuming you
believe in that hierarchy).
However it is not the job of the Keyserver to provide any sort of
policy as to the keys it provides.  As I've said, the Keyserver is for
key distribution, not for any sort of key validation.

I think its because we don't see pseudospoofing as a "danger" like you
do.  Personally, I consider it a necessity.  I like being able to hide
behind an anonymous identity (not that I do, mind you).  I don't see
pseudospoofing as "constraining".  On the contrary, I see it as
freeing us.
As an example, look at Ender's Game, where Ender's brother and sister
get on the net under pseudonyms, and get treated just like everyone
else.  There is no biases.  People are judged on their actions and
words, not by who they are, how old they are, what they look like, or
anything like that.  Maybe you are blind, I don't know.  I've never
met you.
No the software isn't mine, but I consider myself it's God Father.
Mike Graff (explorer at iastate.edu) and I were talking about this a long
time, and he just beat me to learning enough PERL to write the thing.
But I'd like to think that the two of us did most all of the design of
it.  So, in a way, it is my software.
And, as I said, it is not the job of the Keyserver to provide any sort
of policy.  The job of the Keyserver is to distribute keys.  Nothing
more.  Nothing less.  The job of identifying True Names is solely a
job for Digital Signatures, not a job for the Keyserver.  I oppose using it in a bogus fashion because the software is not
designed for such a use, there is absolutely no protection for it (any
key can be added), because I, and all the other Keyserver admins,
believe that all the keyservers should be interconnected, and because
I feel the job for determining a True Name on a key is a job for
Digital Signatures, not for the Keyserver.  I am a cypherpunk.  I don't believe in trusting something on faith
alone, but you seem to be asking for that.  There is no way to protect
such a reckless use of the Keyserver.  The only way to provide a
secure way for True Names is to Cryptographically identify them.
So, Mr. Detweiler, why do you oppose using Digital Signatures to
verify True Names?  I mean, besides that you consider yourself a
Cypherpunk? ;-)

No, it seems that only *you* are flabbergasted.  As has been stated
numerous time, the Keyservers exist solely for distributing keys.
Thats it. No more. No Less.  They are not existant to police anyone.
They make no policy decisions.  Anyone who wants to publish a key,
under any name, may do so.  That has always been the policy.  That
will always be the policy.
Why should it?  As I said, anyone can add any key.  The Keyserser
serves keys.  It doesn't, and I believe that it *shouldn't* make any
verification about the keys it serves.  That is the jobs of
signatures.  The Keyservers (by which I mean the Keyservers at
pgp.mit.edu and elsewhere) *don't provide any authentication*.  They
never have.  They never will.  And I don't believe it is their purpose
to do so.
There are many sane people out here.
I don't think that there are any arguments about identity.  In fact,
the only person I know who's brought up the issue of identity is
yourself.  The Keyservers have been erected for one, AND ONLY ONE,
purpose: TO SERVE KEYS.  If you can tell me which word you do not
understand I will be happy to explain in excruciating detail what I
mean here.  The Keyservers exist so people can request the PGP key for
some identity.  It does not matter whether that identity owns one or
one hundred keys.  If you want to insure identity, sign the key!
Actually, there was more to this argument than just that.  The problem
is not how to insert entries.  Rather, the problem is how to
distribute the system so that the who system knows about every key.
The problem is that each key has more than one name: it has its
userID's associated with it, and it has a keyID, which is inherent to
the key.  The problem is how to distribute the database so that
lookups by keyID can be accomplished.
The question was *never* about who had the ability to enter keys in
the database.  The question was how to implement the database on top
of software that currently didn't allow for what was required.  The
final decision, as it stands, was that the current software was not
capable of performing what was required.
Absolutely correct.  It is called a Digitial Signature Hierarchy (ala
PEM).  It can also be easily implemented in PGP as well.  In fact, I
was planning on doing this!
I'm not trying to sabotage the debate.  I'm trying to say that there
are better, more effective ways of ensuring a True Identity, than
creating a placebo system of keyservers.  It is much more secure to
create a system of signators that will digitally sign keys that belong
to True Names.  If you see such a signature, then you are assured that
it is a True Name.  If you receive mail from a keyserver, it is quite
possible that the Keyserver response was intercepted and changed, or
that the Keyserver itself has been altered by some evil cracker, or
As has been stated a million times: The keyserver provides keys.  The
signatures on the keys provide authentication.  If you want to
authenticate something, check its signatures.  If it has no
signatures, it should not be trusted.  If it has untrustworthy
signatures, it should not be trusted.  Which concept do you not

@_subject: Key vs. Signature revocation & Trust Webs 
While signature revocation certificates have not been implemented,
their precense is possible within PGP.  There is a packet header that
defines such an animal!
I have been a fervent supporter of having such certificates
implemented.  I've even, with some others, developed a fairly good way
to do them: You put a timestamp on it, and if the revocation timestamp
is after the signature timestamp, then the revocation takes
precedence.  If the signature timestamp is greater than the revocation
timestamp, then the signature is kept and the revocation is thrown
In fact, this same design can be used for UserID revocations as well,
in order to get rid of bogus userIDs.
Keys, revocations, new userIDs, signatures.  *ALL* of these act like a
virus.  Once anything is added to a keyserver, all the keyservers get
them.  Revocations are propagated as quickly as new signatures, or new
keys.  As for trusting the servers, well, you don't seem to trust
anybody, but besides that point, you should trust the cryptographic
material you get back from the keyservers in that you can verify the
signatures on those certificates.  In other words, you should not
blindly accept data you get from a keyserver as correct, without
verifying the signatures on it.
Anyways, hopefully this will get implemented sometime soon.  Although
I'm not holding my breath; there are more pressing matters.

@_subject: Can NSA crack PGP? 
True.  In fact, PGP does this.  However, the problem is knowing how
much raw data you need in order to get enough entropy into the system.
That is the hardest part.  For example, say that only one bit is
random for every 8 you get.  That is a very big difference than if 6
of the 8 bits were truely random.  And each machine-type is different!
Yes, you don't really need to know which bits are the hot-bits, but
you need to know how many hot-bits/byte you have, and this is machine
specific.  You could always deal worst-case, in which you assume the
worst machine-type and on machines with better hot-bit ratios you just
get extra entropy.  (That never hurts).

@_subject: RSA examples required 
Here is the response I sent to Peter Simons:
Well, your example that you sent isn't even correct!  Your example
        p = 5    q = 7
        xy = 4*6+1 = 25         x=5
                                y=5
Well, you just chose some bad primes.  Here is a better example:
     p = 5   q = 11  N = pq = 55
     m = (p-1)(q-1) = 4*10 = 40
Now, we need to choose our public and private decryptors, E and d,
such that Ed = 1 mod (m):
     E = 3   d = 27
So, the Public Key (N, E) is (55, 3) and the Private (Secret)
Key (p, q, m, d) is (5, 11, 40, 27).  Now, to encrypt a message,
S, you take C = S^E mod N, and to decrypt you get S = C^d mod N.
So, say the message you want to send is, oh, "8" (for lack of a
better example off the top of my head).  So, you try to encrypt this
message, and you get:
     C = 8^3 mod 55 = 512 mod 55 = 17
You then send this message to the recipient, who then calculates
the message back:
     S = 17^27 mod 55 = 1667711322168688287513535727415473 mod 55 = 8
And you get the original message back.

Yes.  It uses the zip algorithm (I think) as its compression engine.
Every attempt?  You mean every attempt at encryption?  Well, yes and
no.  Yes, there is a semi-known plaintext inside the encrypted data.
It is unknown if this can help an attacker.
The only checksums are the ASCII-armor checksums, and the MD5 hash
which is inside the RSA signature.  Other than these, there are no
checksums.  Neither of these can be used to aid an attacker.
This would give an attacker even MORE of a plaintext attack, since
this will create lines of 64 characters, starting with an "M", which
gives a regular pattern to the plaintext.
No.  However given current technology and assuming no significant
breakthroughs in factoring algorithms, a 1024 bit key wont be broken
for over a million year (significantly more, if I recall).

Well, sorry.  But if you think about it, Shamir figured out a way to
crack a DES key given 2^53 plaintexts (I think this is the right order
of magnitude).  This is with DES, which has 56-bit keys.  PGP uses
IDEA, which is 128-bit keys.  However, the IDEA algorithm is
relatively new, and has not been as throroughly tested.  With DES, it
is fairly easy to say that "knowing the plaintext and cyphertext does
not allow you to easily find the key used".  Is this statement also
true with IDEA?  I don't know.  Also, this is knowing a full block of
plaintext, or the WHOLE plaintext.  Partial plaintext helps even less.
Wait a second, *why* do you want to use UUENCODE?  The reason
compression is used is to 1) reduce the size of the message, and 2) to
reduce the amount of redundancy in the message.  The redundancy can
help an attacker break it.  (If you know that it is ASCII text, it is
easier to try to break it than if its compressed ASCII text, since the
compressed ASCII text is now binary text!).  Why UUENCODE?  Now you
again reduce the problem to fixed-format, fixed line length ASCII
text!  This doesn't help you.  This helps the attacker.  You want to
remove as much redundancy from the plaintext as possible before it is
There is.  There is a header *byte* that lets you know that the block
was decrypted.  Read my statements about partial plain-text.  A good
encryption algorithm will not give you any information about a key
given access to both the plain text and cyphertext.

You asked "Is there an easy way to generate keys larger than 1024
bits?"  I answered No.  This is true, there is no way, currently, in
PGP, to generate keys larger than 1024 bits.  Is there a design flaw?
No.  It was an implementation decision.  It does not mean that the key
size will not be increased in a future release.
There is one flaw limiting to 1024-bit keys.  RSAREF.  It currently
has a limit of 1024 bit keys.  If there is ever to be a PGP that uses
RSAREF, then either RSAREF needs to be capable of larger keys, or PGP
is going to have to keep itself limited to 1024-bit keys.
Technology is not growing exponentially, it is growing geometrically.
And there is a finite limit to the amount it can grow.  It is called
quantum physics!  If you assume that no significant improvements are
made to the factoring problem, algorithmically, then all you can do is
apply more computer power towards the problem.
As a concrete example, there is currently a project to try to factor
RSA129, a 129 digit RSA modulus.  This is equivalent to approximately
425 bits.  The estimated time for completion of this problem is about
6000-10000 MIP-years.  That means it would take 10000 1-MIP machines
one full year to factor the number.  From personal experience in this
project, I can tell you *there is no damn way you are going to factor
a 1024-bit number in 10 years*.  Not until every person on this planet
has hundreds of computers at their disposal that are many orders of
magnitude more powerful than today's most powerful machines, and you
devote every single one of them to the problem for those 10 years,
basically shutting down the planet for 10 years.
Remember, factoring is an exponential problem.  I don't remember the
exact formula for the complexity, offhand, however the number of
MIP-years for a 1024-bit key was somewhere around 10^20 MIP-years.
Don't compare factoring to breaking DES, they are totally different
Define a reasonable about of time?  Currently, the best we have
currently is the $1M machine that can crack DES in 3.5 hours, on
average.  You consider that a "decent personal computer"?  Or do you
consider "semi reasonable amount of time" to be 10 years?
Clearly, you have a lot to learn about orders of magnitude!

No, this is a bad idea.  Any arbitrary setting of expire time by the
keyserver is a bad idea.  It is the key owner that should set the
timeout of the PGP key (there is an expiration time in the key
certificate, but the current implementation sets it to zero and
ignores the field).  There are people that have longer or shorter
keys, and its possible that they might want longer or shorter
expiration times.
I think that there are a few things that can and should be done.
First, a revoked key should get all signatures removed from that key
(and possibly any signatures that key made should disappear as well).
Also, revoked keys should probably time out from the keyservers after
some period of time.

This makes sense..  A signature is a binding between a key and a
userID.  If you remove that userID, then clearly the signatures
binding that userID to the key should be removed as well, since
otherwise they are binding nothing.
What should be available (although it is not implemented) is a userID
revocation, where you can basically send out a messages that will
remove userIDs from a key.  Then again, signature revocations should
be implemented as well...

The point is that someone shouldn't NEED to revoke their key if all

What if the binding of the userID is a result of a position that you
hold... For example, I am the owner of a company and I sign people's
identifiers, saying that they are employees of mine, and possibly what
their position is.  Now say I fire someone, I want to be able to
revoke my signature since the binding is no longer valid!  But I
shouldn't need to force them to generate a new key.

@_subject: public accounts / PGP / passphrases 
For someone to use your secret key, they need two things:
On a public system, 1) is easy (relatively speaking).  2) is more
difficult, but someone could theoretically listen in to the line
anywhere between your keyboard and the CPU.  What do you know about
what's going on on the other end of the phone line?
My rule of thumb (for me) is to only use PGP when I have direct
control over everything between the keyboard on which I am typing, and
the CPU on which PGP is running. This doesn't mean that you _can't_ run PGP on a public machine.  It
also doesn't mean that you _shouldn't_, either.  It is a matter of
security -- how secure do you want your key to be.  If you really
don't mind it being insecure, you might as well generate a 384-bit key
(which has been proven by RSA-129 to be insecure to an amateur attack).
What do you use to contact your public machine?  Do you dial in from
home?  What kind of machine do you have at home?  You might consider
running PGP at home if that is at all possible.
It would be nice to integrate PGP into terminal emulators, too, like
kermit or seyon or red ryder or whatever, so that you could easily use
PGP locally to sign/encrypt things on the remote end.  Wishful
thinking, I guess...

Uhh, this is not at all true.  When PGP verifies a message, it will
strip out the quoting dashes in the output.  This is documented in RFC
822 (I think) about quoting messages.
Just run the message through PGP and it will strip out the first level
of quoting in the output message, and you should be able to then run
PGP on the rest of the message as well.
This is not a bug, it is a feature to let PGP know *WHAT* was being
signed, so that nested PGP clearsigned-messages don't interfere with
each other.  If it didn't quote, then if I wanted to clearsign a PGP
message, the output would look something like:

Why would it have to?  A plain remailer takes the input you give it,
and replays it to the output.  It doesn't modify the message in any
way, so there is no problem.
A remailer that signs a message should take what you send it (no
matter _HOW_ you sent it), sign that message wholesale, and then send
out the signed message.  This means that if you send it a PGP-signed
message, the output message will have two signatures -- the outer
signature being the signing remailer, and the inner signature (which
is quoted by PGP at the remailer) is the signature on the original
This is the correct behavior, and _SHOULD NOT_ be changed.
An anonymizing remailer _might_ want to take the output of a PGP
message and pass that into the output, but that is a different
function altogether.
I dont understand why a plain remailer should have to know anything
about PGP if it is just doing remailing, and in any case it should
never have to verify a PGP-signed message, unless that is the purpose
of the remailer.  And even if that IS the case, it should only unwrap
the OUTERMOST wrapping from PGP -- it *SHOULD NOT* recursively try to
collapse the PGP armors.  That is NOT a remailer's job.

Actually, PGP wont even do that.  If the key is not in your keyring,
it will complain about not finding it and output the de-armored
message.  If you want to add the key, you need to run it through PGP
once to de-armor it, save off the output, and then add that output
message to your keyring.
This is exactly what people should do.  People should _never_
clearsign a public key block.  If you want to sign it, sign the key
inside the keyblock.  When someone clearsigns a keyblock, they are
making two passes over it to create it, which requires you to make two
passes to read it in!

encryption to provide security services for electronic mail messages and data files.  These services include confidentiality and digital signature. PGP is widely used throughout the global computer community.   This document describes the format of "PGP files", i.e., messages that have been
encrypted and/or signed with PGP.              PGP was created by  Philip Zimmermann and first released, in Version 1.0, in 1991.

@_subject: KEYSRVR: tabula rasa? 
This has always been there.  Many people consider it a feature.  I
like having the ability to tell a friend, who just signed my key, to
just upload it to the keyserver, since the signature tends to do much
more good being on the keyserver than being on my keyring.
Also, because the keyserver uses PGP as a back end, it is possible to
send multiple keys in a single message.  You cannot do batch-processed
incremental adds using PGP; if a keyfile contains multiple keys, there
is no way to have a program only add specific additions.
What about people who don't have email, or pseudonyms, or keys without
email addresses?  How do you deal with those, if you have to add your
own key.  And what about forged mail; I can easily send an email
message claiming to be you.  So what if I need to sign it?  If I was
creating a new key to spoof you, I _could_ sign it, and forge mail,
and it would be added.  So what?  What does this buy you?  Absolutely
You are definitely missing something obvious!  I will absolutely not
do what you suggest here; I refuse.  If you want rigorous key
verifications then move into a PEM strict hierarchy (which I will
perfectly well admit has its uses) or patronize the SLED database
people, who will do what you want.
What I want to provide with my keyserver is an easy way for anyone to
distribute a PGP key easily.  I don't care who you are, what you
believe in, or what you want to accomplish, but if you want to let
people have your PGP key, I want it on my server so others can get it.
I think that many of the other keyserver operators believe as I do --
the role of a keyserver is key distribution, not key verification.
Key verification is done very will in PGP itself.  The method is
called SIGNING A KEY.  If you want to verify a key, check the
signatures on it.  This is exactly what the web of trust is about.  If
you trust me to sign keys, then you will trust the keys I've signed.
If you don't trust me, then my signatures mean nothing.  But you
should never trust a key from the keyserver just because you obtained
it from a keyserver.  That's just plain stupid.
Again: ABSOLUTELY NOT!  Keyservers are open to everyone; all comers
welcome.  Everyone from "Pr0duct Cypher" to "BlackNet" to "Jeffrey
I. Schiller " is welcome to put their key on the
Again, there is a very big difference (which you clearly do not
comprehend) between key distribution and key verification.  The
keyservers ONLY do the former, and you should do the latter.  Doing
otherwise is, as I said, stupid.
Just add your new key to the keyservers and have people start using
it.  Life goes on.  You are not the first to be in this situation, and
you definitely will not be the last.
I hope I've given you some insight.

Well, I don't know exactly how many calculations are necessary,
but I've seen some posts that have given general numbers...
Let me give some examples to try to answer your question.
Currently, we estimate about 2500 MIP-years have gone into
trying to factor RSA129 (about 425 bits).  We estimate we
are about 60% through... The whole project taking about 5000 Figure that every ten decimal digits adds one order of magnitude. So, a 512-bit (~155-digit) key would require about 5e7 MIP-years.  And a 1024-bit key would require approximately 5e22 MIP-years.  (These are approximations -- please do not quote these numbers).
Brute-forcing IDEA takes about as much computation as factoring
something between a 1200 and 3000 bit RSA key (I've heard both
numbers, but I don't know the numbers).  So, in the current
implementation, RSA is the weak link!
Since the passphrase is just a hash to an IDEA key, breaking the
secret ring is as hard as either dictionary attacking the key, or
breaking IDEA, which is harder than factoring the RSA key, given
current knowledge about the algorithms.
I hope this answers your questions.  If someone has real numbers

I disagree.  While I can honestly say that I don't like most Detweiler
posts, I feel that he is showing us the possibility of how remailers
can (and are) being abused.  I think censorship is the wrong answer.
I think there needs to be some accountability, even if it is anonymous
"How do we acount for something that's anonymous?" I hear you ask me.
Well, I don't have the answer to that.  Maybe our idea of anonymity is
slightly in error.  Maybe we need something like penet, where you
actually get a return ID, to have some sort of anonymity.  I don't
know 100% for sure that Detweiler is an12070, although I do believe it
is his address.
Although I don't agree with his means, I do feel that once in a while
Detweiler does post something useful.  He does have something to say,
although he has a real backwards way of saying it.  (So backwards that
he causes people to stop listening before he makes his point).
But I feel censorship is *always* the wrong solution, unless it is
done at the end-point.  I.e., I can *choose* not to read posts from
detweiler, or an12070, but that is my choice.  I do not think anyone
has the right to say to me that I *cannot* read his posts.  It should
be my perogative.  Maybe we should change our systems to allow for
anonymous accountability?

I'm not sure that I really meant to have a receipt, more or a

think a question is: who are we protecting against?  Are we protecting
against the remailer operators?  Or are we trying to protect from a
third party?
I think we should go back and re-examine our goals for anonymity.
To me, this is like NEARNet saying that they have no obligation to
accept packets from a known disruptive user.  No, I don't believe that
that is the answer.  Then again, I don't think that a remailer should
run out of an account, but rather on a machine, but that's a different
story.  I consider a remailer a service, and as such, the service
should be available to all comers.  (With digital postage this
paradigm makes much more sense).  I do not think of it like a home.
I also agree that positive reputation is important, but I think that
is much more difficult to implement than a more secure anonymous
To reiterate: I do think that something needs to be done, but I think
we should analyze what we are trying to accomplish rather than rushing

An interesting idea, although highly unpracticable.  Sending a binary
is nearly impossible.  As an example, I have at my disposal (and I log
into regularly) at least 6 different platforms.  All Unix, but each
one would require its own binary!
This doesn't mean that your idea has no merit.  On the other hand, it
is an interesting key distribution model.  Except there are a number
of problems that I can see.  First, anything you know about the person
is something that someone else could probably do a little research and
find out as well.  This inherently means it is not a very secure
channel, rather it is only moderately secure.
Also, there is no way to meet your goal of "no external binary
needed."  There may be a few things you can do in lieu of this, but
all of them require some knowledge of the recipient hardware system.
But in a case such as mine, even that wouldn't help (do you send it
for an RT, Vax, Decmips, RS6000, Alpha, Linux, Sun386i, Next, ...?)

You are assuming that I (I being every possible recipient) have PERL

people with their 20M IBM PC-XT DOS machines?  They probably don't
have PERL.  And I *know* that most Mac users do not have PERL.
I'm not saying that PERL would be a bad thing to use.  You could also
theoretically use sh and cc!  But the problem is you have to assume
that *every* user has these available, and that is a bad assumption.
If you are going to assume that, you might as well assume that they
have PGP and save all the trouble!  Why not just assume they have PGP
and generate a file which will execute PGP on itself?  That solves the
problem, and is secure. (Well, it doesn't solve the problem of a user
running a random exacutable sent in the mail).
BTW: I must apologize for interchanging "binary" for "exacutable"...
I tend to do it a lot, and in the context I confused the topic.  When
I said that the problem was sending a binary for every machine, I
meant the problem was creating something that could execute on every
machine.  While PERL is a compromise, it is definitely not the panacea
to this problem.  Do you want to target certain architechtures?  I
hope not.

I just recently got MacRipem and find it much easier to use than PGP,

        indicate that Ripem isn't as secure.  Why is this?
I don't doubt that its much easier to use -- it was written by Ray
Lau, who is an excellent Mac/UI programmer.  The most reasonable
reasons why it might be called "less secure" is that RIPEM does not
have a signature web like PGP does.  It is possible in PEM to only
have one signature on your certificate, which can be your own
signature, or that of a CA.  Therefore, you either have the status of
"I say I am who I say I am", or a "Certification Authority says I am
who I say I am".
I hope this answeres your question.

I think we have a lack of communication here.  What I said is
completely true about PEM, as well as RIPEM.  You cannot have more
than one signature on your certificate.  I did not mention signature
chains in my message at all, only signatures.
For example, in PEM, you have the root key sign some certificate, and
that certificate signs another, and so on down the chain to a user
certificate.  However, in PEM I cannot sign your certificate!  *THAT*
is what I'm talking about.  PEM certificates can have one, and *ONLY*
one, signature on them.
I'm not saying that I think the PEM CA model is bad -- there are good
points to it.  I just feel it is too restrictive.  I like being able
to have anyone sign anybody's key in PGP, and building certification
in that manner.  The fact that in PEM you have a lot of hoops to jump
through in order to become a CA will, IMHO, be its downfall.  Right
now anyone can become a PGP Certification Authority.

This is incorrect.  There is a possible security problem with *pure*
RSA, but PGP does not use pure RSA.  When you encrypt to multiple
recipients in PGP (and you can verify this by reading the code), you
choose a random IDEA session key, and then you RSA-encrypt that key
(with random-data padding) in each public key, changing the random
padding with each encryption.
No can do; this would validate the MIT license on the code.  The
change, about which you can obtain via anonymous ftp even if you are
not in the US, is that the data-packet version number will change from
'2' to '3' on september 1st, rendering older versions unable to read
the data after 1 September.

MD5, like all hash functions, are many-to-one functions.  This means

iterations, you just move those bits around.

RIPEM does not interoperate with PGP, but it may interoperate with

It turns out that the signature algorithms are similar, so it may be
possible in a future version of PGP (3.0?) to get the signatures to be
equivalent, so you could, theoretically, convert a signed PGP document

after 1-September).

Having said that:
The NSA claims that they were asked to design an ecryption algorithm
for government use that can be used security by the government but
cannot be used against the government.  In order to accomplish this
(according to the NSA -- see the pattern yet? ;-) they developed a
secure algorithm (a-t-t-NSA), but put it in a package such that it
cannot be used without the key-escrow system.  It is this key-escrow
system that provides that functionality that "it cannot be used
against the government" (NSA-person's words, not mine).
I think the idea was that the government itself cannot operate without
a government standard, so the NSA was asked to create one, and they
did.  They also said that the key escrow system was not designed to
catch criminals, but to deter criminals from using the Skipjack
encryption algorithm (which they claim has no trap doors, and is very
In a private conversation afterwards, I asked about the fact that once
the two escrowed keys get discovered, say via a legal wiretap, then my
key is no good anymore.  They claimed that you can only read the data
by using a special box such that this box gets inputs from all the
escrow agencies and the law enforcement agency and outputs the
conversation, and that you cannot extract the key information from
this box.  I replied in the standard manner: Show me this box and
prove that is has these properties.  Their response was, of course,
that they could not do so, and that I had to trust them.  When I said
that I couldn't do that, the NSA employee suggested that I use PGP!

@_subject: low-overhead encrypted telnet 
Couple of comments:
1) Kerberos *does* work between corporate entities.  I can, for
example, go to Iastate (ISU) and get MIT Kerberos tickets, and then
rlogin -x to MIT, encrypting the session (I can, and I have).  Also,
it is possible (and I know someone who is doing it at this moment) for
someone from ISU, with ISU tickets, to log into an account here at
2) Using your example, a user on host A telnets to host B, and from
host B they telnet to host C, if the A<->B link is encrypted, then so
long as the user trusts host B, then A<->C is secure as well (assuming
B<->C is encrypted).
3) Just encrypting from client->server will not necessarily reduce the
load on the server.  Also, doing something like DES is really not a
very high CPU operation, IMHO.  Maybe a better protocol than the one
done in rlogin -x is in order (this sends 8 characters over the link
for every successful "read", which means you can be getting anywhere
from 100% down to 12% throughput of plaintext in the cyphertext!)
4) Charon, which is based upon Kerberos, was developed exactly for
this type of problem: you want to authenticate securely over links
which may not otherwise be secure, but you trust the CPU in front of
you!  The paper describing Charon is available via anonymous ftp:

Charon does not require any shared kerberos.  All it does require is
that the destination server have an rcmd srvtab, and the user have a
kerberos principal that can authenticate to that server in some form.
To use your netcom example, if netcom had their own kerberos realm,
and if they were running the Charon server, then anyone with a Charon
client and a netcom account could securely authenticate to their
netcom account, no matter where they were actually coming from.

I've actually spoken to the author of Term regarding adding an

find an easy way to hook it in.  The most difficult part would be the

either a DES, 3-DES, or IDEA key, or using Charon to get a kerberos

No.  The only way to do this would be to tell PGP to use this file as
a keyring, but you can't do that if its in ASCII armor.  Besides, the
fingerprint was designed to be used to verify the key when you sign
it, not as anything that should be used to know whether you want to
add the key to the keyring, therefore it is only possible to -kvc
something on your keyring.
FYI: If you say that yes, you want to sign it, while you are adding it
to your keyring, it will then display the fingerprint for you.

No, you want to give the user the option to sign and/or encrypt the
message.  Just like I can optionally sigh a letter, or optionally
write it on a postcard vs. putting it in an envelope.  It should be an
option, not a mandate.  It *shouldn't* be automagic.  It should be
configurable.  It should give the user a choice.  Maybe that user
decides "encrypt all the time"...  That is his/her perogative to do
No, this is not a reasonable goal.  No, let me rephrase that.  This is
a reasonable goal, but the current implementation of PGP is not the
answer.  If you want zero-knowledge authentication of total strangers,
then you *require* a certification hierarchy, and the most effiecient
is one similar to that defined in RFC 1422.
PGP has a more grass roots method of determining key validity.  Let me
give you an example where PGP *works* -- Today.  Say, for example,
that I own a retail store.  I print my key on all my receipts, and
anyone can get it.  It is published widely, so basically there is no
easy way to spoof it.  But this doesn't matter.  The only reason I use
my key is because I want to be able to certify customer's keys.  Ok, a
customer comes in and gives me, somehow, a credit-card and a PGP key.
I can validate the credit card, and if it validates, then I sign this
key.  Now, anytime this person wants to buy something, all they have
to do is sign an order slip with their key, and I can validate it, and
I know that this is a "valid" customer.
There is no way to perform a denial of service attack (except load me
down with bogus email, but lets disregard that attack).  You can't
forge a PGP key, and I only accept keys that I've certified myself.
Ok, maybe you don't like that idea.  Ok, say that VISA starts signing
PGP keys for it's customers.  I can get the VISA Public Key directly
from VISA, then I know that any key signed by VISA is a valid key, and
I should accept orders from them.  Same thing.  No way to spoof it.
However, all of these require some out-of-band communication to make
sure you have the real key.  Unfortunately, *every* Privacy Enhanced
Mail system has this *feature* (or mis-feature, or bug, or however you
feel like looking at it).
Basically, what you want is the RFC 1422 Certification Tree.  With
that tree, you can verify the authenticity of a key with zero
knowledge about that tree.  The only knowledge you need to know a
priori is the root key of the tree.
Before many people start responding to me saying that the 1422 CA Tree
is a Bad Thing, let me state for the record that I believe that there
are valid uses for the tree.  What Graham wants is a valid usage of
the tree.  What I am saying, however, is that there are other uses for
other trust mechanisms.
Graham: It is not the keyserver's job to certify keys.  It never has
been, and I still believe that it shouldn't be its job.  However, it
sounds like you are requesting that PGP have imbedded in it knowledge
about the RFC 1422 Hierarchy.  I believe this is a valid goal, and
should be pursued.  In fact, the PEM-DEV group is looking at adding
alternative turst models to the PEM system, which would merge the
current PGP web-of-trust model with the current PEM Strict Hierarchy
model, blending them into something which will solve both Graham's
problem of zero-knowledge trust, and also allow my retailer example to
work without all the overhead of applying to ISOC to get into the

not have even been reading much of the list.  I may be wrong, but it
appears to me that you saw the list in a recent publication and joined
it sometime in mid-to-late April.
However, not to make this a flaming letter, I would like to address
your distribution point.  And I must agree that the distribution of
PGP has been fairly Internet-biased.  However one reason, IMHO, that
this is the case is that private BBSs were afraid to carry PGP because
of the questionable legality w.r.t. the RSA patent.
With the advent of PGP 2.5, to be released soon, this problem will go
away in the US, and I believe that we will see a great number of
distribution sites go online.
I don't know if the government is going to ban crypto, but I am going
to fight my darndest to try to stop them from doing so.  The question
about criminals using crypto is a crock -- even if they ban it, the
criminals will still use it: that's why they are criminals, they don't
follow the law!  So banning crypto will basically get the government
nowhere (then again, I feel the same way about the outlawing of guns,
but see where that went).
Another thing is that right now, I don't think that every person and
his mother would know what to do if they had PGP.  It requires,
currently, some base of knowledge to successfully use crypto, and it
is really easy to have a false sence of security.  For example, Joe
Average ComputerUser is using PGP.  He is on a shared machine and
keeps his private key online, has a 6-character passphrase (his dog's
name) and types it over the modem...  Yet this person thinks that no
one can read his files since they are encrypted using PGP!
No, this is not the right way to do it.  We need to educate people
about the risks of NOT using encryption, and when they understand the
risks and start asking how to not be at risk, *then* you can show them
PGP and explain how it fills the holes, and what it can and cannot do.
That is the way that we will have to do it.  And that is what we have
(or at least I have) been trying to accomplish.
I hope this makes sence to you.

@_subject: Malformed Signatures? 
There was a bug in the old versions of PGP.  It was discovered
in version 2.2, and was corrected, somewhat in version 2.3.
The bug was that the RSA-encoded certificated were actually
in the reverse byte-order than they should have been, before they
were encoded in the RSA encryption.
This was somewhat corrected in 2.3, in that 2.3 could read the new,
correct, pkcs_compatible signature, although PGP didn't start
outputting this corrected signtature until 2.3a.
PGP version 2.6 cannot read the old version.  This means that anything
that was created with versions before 2.3a cannot be read by version
2.6, and this is what you are seeing when you see "Malformed or
obsolete signature format"..  It is a signature that was created
before 2.3a, and therefore 2.6 does not understand it.
FYI: PGP 2.6 has a neat feature... If you recreate a signature in
the new format, with a newer timestamp than an old signature, 2.6
will use the newer signature in lieu of the older signature when
merging keyrings, so you can replace old signatures.

@_subject: Kocher's RSA attack 
I must disagree, software implementations of RSA can and probably do
allow the timing attacks.  It all depends on the modexp implementation.
Most implementations that I know of, when performing an x^y mod n will
require a squarings and b multiplies, where a is the number of bits in
y and b is the number of 1-bits in y.
You iterate through the bits of y.  For each bit you square x, and if
the bit is 1 you multiply it into an accumulator.  Paul's attack can
determine if this multiply is done or not, given perfect timing
conditions, in 2 ciphertexts per bit.  This CAN happen in software,
and it does in implementations like RSAREF.  In fact, I'm fairly sure
that PGP's MPILib would be subject to this attack if it weren't for
all the other randomness involved in PGP.
The point is that just because an implementation is in software does
not mean you should be sloppy in your protections against this attack.
We should change implementations, both in software and hardware, to
defeat this attack.  Making operations run in constant time seems to
be the best way to defeat this attack.
Yes, we should also look at other possible attacks.  Covert channels
in a workstation environment are important, but they have nothing to
do with Paul's particular attack.  It would be interesting to see how
one could use covert challens to gain the timing information needed to
make this attack, howver.  I have a few ideas.

The problem is that you are using the wrong command....
This is the correct behavior of "pgp filename".  If you want other
behavior, you should tell PGP how you want it to behave.
A very noble effort, combining PGP with mailers.  Btw: When you run
"pgp filename" and filename contains public keys, it will ask you
before it adds them to your keyring!
You can use "pgp -d" to force it to do a decryption (although you
cannot specify which key to use for the decryption; it will choose any
of the keys on your secret keyring).
Well, I'm not exactly sure what you want.  You can give PGP no
password and it will tell you to whom a message is encrypted.  You can
call pgp -ka and it will _only_ add keys (and complain if you are
given anything else).  There is no way to ask PGP "what kind of
message is this"; that is sort of what the ASCII ARMOR header is for.
No, you should, at this point, consider working around the problems in
the monolithic PGP, until a more modular library is available, to

Not at all.
The point is to have a centralized, distributed key distribution
mechanism, similar in concept to the PGP Public Keyservers, but which
scale much much better.  The concept is similar to a DNS of PGP keys
(think of the DNS model, not the DNS implementation) where you have
keys distributed based upon site.  For example, MIT could server MIT's
keys, and CMU would server CMU's keys.
This does not go against PGP in any way.  In fact, it augments PGP

I doubt PGP will change this in the near future.  That would require a

the database to be lookup on userID only, that solves your database
problem.  As for the keyID->userID, well, this would only be required
to _verify_ a signature.  In that case, you know who sent the message
to you so you can ask them for the key.  When you want to encrypt to
someone, you already know to whom you want to encrypt, so the same
thing applies.

The idea I've had, and have floated to a few people, is not to
base a distributed keyserver on DNS, but to use DNS as a model
for a distributed key database.  Hal, yes, you could have a keyID->userID mapping, but that doesn't
scale well.  Let me give you a concrete example (using DNS): I want
the host information for TOXICWASTE.MIT.EDU.  From the root servers I
get to EDU->MIT->TOXICWASTE, and find its IP address (18.85.0.40).
This would be like asking for a key by UserID (warlord at MIT.EDU would
go to the MIT.EDU keyserver).  Now, lets work in reverse, you have
18.85.0.40 and want to get the hostinfo.  In DNS there is a 1-to-1
mapping of Domain to Network.  You _know_ that any machine that is in
18.* will be at MIT, so again you can go to the MIT nameserver for
This doesn't work with PGP KeyID, since the keyID is a random string

that Perry is trying to address.  I just don't know of a good way of

No offense, James, but this needs to be a free infrastructure.  When
you get your shell account/IP address/PPP drop/etc., you should also
automagically be allocated space in a keyserver.  It shouldn't cost
you anything to be put in it (just like it doesn't cost you anything
to be put in the Telephone White Pages.
The keyservers have to be distributed so that there is a single method
for everyone in the world to connect to the white-page server of their
choice.  I'm sorry, but the WWW is not it.  The WWW does not scale,
and personally if I had to pay to be put on your server, I would
ignore it; I'm perfectly happy using the Public Keyservers.
Just as sites currently provide DNS service for names, they will, in
some time, provide KeyService as well.  It's just a matter of time.
As for the "centralized" part...  I think the distributed part is much
more important.  The public keyserver keyrings are currently over 3MB
and growing.  We need to be able to split that keyring across multiple
servers and have requests go to the appropriate locations.  Yes, there
will be a centralized authority delegator, but the keys themselves, as
well as the means to obtain them, will be distributed.

The only problem with piggybacking off the current DNS implementation
is that DNS was designed for SMALL pieces of data (read: hostnames and
IP addresses).  PGP keys are HUGE pieces of data, in respect, and DNS
just wont handle the sizes.  For example, my PGP key is about 8k of
data (approximately).  DNS would never be able to handle that!
It its bigger than a single UDP packet DNS has trouble.
No, while DNS is a perfect model for a distributed keyserver,
it is by no means the implementation infrastructure that we want

Actually, a slight correction.  PGP does have an algorithm byte

So long as you use a public key to encrypt, you get this byte.  If
you just use PGP -c, using the current implementation, you do not

@_subject: RSA-129 vs. RC4 (was Re: RC4 crack) 
Not quite.  The UIDs that were given out for RSA-129 had nothing to do
with the search space.  The reason is that RSA-129 did not search for
the prime factors; it searched for quadratic residue relations.
Moreover, ANY relations within the space is a valid datapoint.  As a
result, the UIDs ojnly told the factoring clients where to start
looking for relations.
You can effectively think of it as a seed to a random number
generator.  So long as everyone has a different seed, they will get
different random numbers.  Thats what the UIDs did; provided each
client with a different starting point.
You had to get a new UID for each run of mpqs because starting over
with the same uid would re-run all the checks you've already done.
Why double-run when UIDs are cheap?  You see, unlike the RC4 crack,
there was no relation between the UIDs and the relations returned.
As the person who wrote the UID returning script, I can tell you that
all it did was keep a file with the last UID given, and when an email
requests came in, it would create a lock on that file, return the last
UID+1 through the number of UIDs requested, and then update the file.
There was no basis of the relations received.  In fact, the UID
responder could have been run on any machine -- it could care less
about the data returned.
The point of runfactor was to allow you to obtain a large segment of
UIDs and dole them out locally.  Since there wasn't a relation between
UID and data returned, then it didn't matter if some UIDs never
For RC4, you _have_ to search everywhere.  Therefore, you would want
to make runfactor an interactive program that contacted a central

This is where you are very wrong.  I am not saying that "if you can't

source is available, and thousands of people have looked at the
source, and none of them have found any holes in it.
How do you propose that a user's keystrokes can be analyzed?  If you
assume that the PC's internal clock speed >> typing speed (which is a
good assumption -- how many keystrokes/second can you type?) then you
have a large amount of randomness that can be gained from timing
keystrokes.  Even a good typist will not have an even typestroke!
Have you read RFC 1750?  If not, I would recommend you read it before
you consider continuing this thread!
I think it has no backdoors because Jeff Schiller and I (among others)
have looked closely at the random number generator code (he has taken
a much closer look than I) and believe it to be secure.  I also know
that I did not put any backdoors into the code (but why would you
believe me, I must be paid by the government to say this, right?)
As to why I believe it is not subject to attack, I ask you again to go
read RFC 1750.  PGP follows its recommendations fairly closely.  There
is only one place where PGP fails to follow, and that is that PGP does
expose the bucket of random bits, rather than mixing them before
exporting them.  However I do not believe that this would affect the
generation of PGP Public Keys.

@_subject: Public Key Confusion 
When you want to sign a key, you should use "pgp -ks".  You should
never clearsign a public key -- it buys you absolutely nothing other
than saying that "I saw this key at some point, and this message
(which is a public key block) came from me".  Have you signed your own key using "pgp -ks"?  Have you extracted your
key (using "pgp -kxa") since you signed it?  Or did you only extract
it before you signed it?  This would be the cause of the confusion.
If you sign a key, the signature gets attached to the key certificate.
However you do not need that signature in order to _use_ the key.  So,
people to whom you gave your key without a signature can still use
that key, it just doesn't have your signature on it.
As for the keyserver, it _ONLY_ accepts keys; if you clearsign your
key before you send it, then you are not sending a key, you are
sending a message that contains a key.  This is not the same thing.
That is why the keyserver rejected it.
If you performed the pgp -ks, then you should re-perform the pgp -kxa
and distribute the newly extracted key.
I hope this answers all your questions.  All of this, and more, should
be explained in the PGP Documentation which is included with PGP.

Actually, its not.  There is precedent, in that at one point (rumour
mode on -- I have not verified this story) MIT was asked to not allow
certain students into the MIT nuclear reactor.  These international
students had been accepted into the Nuclear Engineering program, which
sort of requires them to have access.  MIT's response was to tell the
gov't that if they didn't want to let these students have access to
the nuclear reactor, then they should not be allowed in the country,
since MIT will not discriminate against students based on silly
criteria such as where they live.  The state department said they
couldn't do that, since they had nothing to keep the students out of
the country.  MIT responded that they couldnt do it either, and the
gov't backed down.
I'm not convinced that it is as risky as you say.  Besides, MIT does
have a lot of political power, so they are more likely to get away
with it than other places might.  However I think it is a reasonable

I can explain (and have explained in this forum) the technical aspect
of how the MIT PGP site works.  I was not involved in the law aspect
of the debate, so I cannot answer legal questions.
There is a two-tiered protection scheme.  The first scheme is that you
need to know the secret directory where PGP resides.  This directory
changes location every 30 minutes, so any attacker has a 30 minute
window in which a name will be valid.  Not 30 minutes from the time
they receive it, 30 minutes from the time the directory last changed
The second scheme involves using reverse DNS lookups and comparing the
DNS hostname to a list of know US-valid hostnames/domains.
An attacker needs to be able to circumvent both schemes at once in
order to get to PGP.

Sure it can, and I know people who do.  Here is what you do:
1) Generate two keys.  First generate your encryption key, then
generate your signature key.  This way, your signature key will be
placed first in your secret keyring, and it will be used by default.
Alternatively, you could use two (slightly) different userIDs on the
keys and put something in your config.txt
2) Extract the keys in reverse order into a single keyfile and then
distribute that keyfile to people.  This way, when it gets added to
other people's keyrings, the encryption key will be placed first, and
that will be used by default.
3) Proceed to use PGP normally.  When you sign a message, it will find
the signature key first and use that.  When someone wants to encrypt
to you, they will find the encryption key first.  When verifying the
signature or trying to decrypt the message, it uses the keyID to
determine which key was used, so order does not matter.
The only problem is that if someone re-orders their keyring then this
will no longer work.  E.g., if the keys are added in the wrong order.

This doesn't take into account increase in computer power.  If you
take into account increase in technology at the current rate, doubling
every 18 months, then a 1024-bit key should be breakable in about 100
However this doesn't take into account increases in algorithms.  There
is no way to predict the discovery of a new factoring algorithm.  In
addition, there is no way to predict a computational discovery which
might increase the base technology faster than the current trend.
To get back to your question: If smoe [sic] organization spent 10
billions [sic] of dollars on a cracking machine, would it be possible
to crack the keys in a reasonable time?
Well, lets assume a P100 is 50 MIPS and costs $500.  Then the $10B
would purchase 20 million machines.  Discounting the storage
requirements (factoring a number this large will probably require on
the order of hundreds of GBs of storage) and end-time processing power
(unknown) required to factor a 1024-bit number, this set of machines
would provide "enough" relations for a 1024-bit number in about 1.5
years per key.

just Radix 64 ASCII armoring"?  PGP does a lot more than just Ascii
Armor.  The Ascii Armor is just a self-recognizing transport
mechanism, nothing more.
The real meat behind PGP is its encryption and key management
utilities.  PGP uses the IDEA cipher, combined with RSA key
management, to securely encrypt any kind of file.  The Ascii Armor is
used solely to protect the PGP files during transport over email and
other ascii-only protocols.
I hope this clears up any possible misconceptions.

The 90-bit key length is for secret key ciphers, not public key
ciphers.  There is a conversion metric for public key ciphers based
upon the difficulty of breaking the cipher.
For example, a 1024 bit RSA key is about 85 bits of security, which is
below the 90-bit limit they are proposing.  The 90-bits of security
does not mean you are limited to a 90-bit RSA key.

Umm, I dont know.  How is MIT PGP flawed?  Besides a few known bugs,
of course.  There shouldn't be much difference, code-wise, between the
MIT version and the International version.  The major difference is
that MIT PGP has a license to use RSAREF which makes it legal to use
w.r.t. patent issues in the US.
AFAIK, there are no versions of PGP which do not use RSA.  They
all do.  The only difference is that MIT PGP uses RSAREF, whereas
the International versions use a non-licensed version of RSA.

@_subject: Stealth PGP work 
The big question I have for you is, what do you mean by "stealth" PGP?
Do you want a PGP message which doesn't say to whom it is encrypted?
Or do you want a PGP message which does not even acknowledge that it
is a PGP message?  If what you want is the former, then that can fit
under the PGP API fairly well.  If you want the latter, it will not.
The reason is that PGP, by definition, is a self-describing packet
format.  Without that description there is no general way for the PGP
library to discover what kind of message it is parsing order to
perform the proper operation to open the message.  OTOH, if just the
keyID is missing, the library will happily try all the keys on your
secret keyring until one succeeds or they all fail (I'm not sure if
this is implemented, but it fits quite nicely under the API).
The other question I have is: who do you think the "customers" of PGP
are?  If you think the majority of PGP's customers are the
crypto-privacy activitst types, you are highly mistaken.  PGP has hit
the main stream, and is being used by many non-crypto-aware people.
Probably more of them than there are of us.

@_subject: Stealth PGP work 
I'm not familiar with the exact details of what stealth does, which is
why I asked for more details.  The problem is that PGP API, when
decrypting a message, keys off the PGP packet types in order to
operate.  If stealth can work outside of PGP 2.6.2, then it should be
possible to add it on to PGP 3, theoretically.
And in some ways this is true.  The PGP API does allow for add-ons.
I'll explain what I mean later in this message.  Then again, I don't
know to whom you spoke.  The "PGP 3 development team" has changed a
lot over the last couple years.  At this point, for all practical
purposes, there only two people on the team.
It is not implemented directly in this manner, but it is possible to
get this functionality.  The application will get a callback at which
point it can direct the PGP library.  For example, if you want to
dearmor but not decrypt, when you get to the encryption part you tell
it not to continue and to just output the encrypted block.
Basically, the PGP Message Processing API is based on a pipeline
model.  You have a bunch of pipeline modules that are connected, and
each module performs some transformation on the data.  For example,
you have a text module that goes into a literal module which goes into
a signature module which goes into an encryption module which then
goes into an armor module.  To add stealth, you just add a stealth
module in there.  However I can tell you now that we are not working
on such a module for the PGP 3.0 release.
I'll hopefully have the API Spec and Programmer's Guide in a state
where I can let others see it in the near future.  But since I'm going
to be off the net for about a week or two at the end of the month, it
might have to wait until March unless a miracle happens in the next

Key certificates also include signatures.  If you have many signatures
on your key, your key certificate can get very big.  For example, mine
is about 10k or more (I haven't checked recently) with all the
signature intact.
As for keysize, you can generate keys as large as 2048 bits with PGP
2.6.2; you just need to type "2048" when it asks you for a keysize.
Alternatively, you can type in any keysize you wish to use, rather
than using the default sizes.

@_subject: Internet Privacy Guaranteed ad (POTP Jr.) 
I, too, am interested in seeing the underlying algorithms.  Not
because I don't believe that they work, but because I'm interested in
seeing what you may have found that no one else has.  However from
your recent mailing I think I know what you're doing:
I think this is the key.  Question: if I knew the starting "OTP" that
seeded your algorithms, would I be able to re-create the whole stream
and decrypt a message?  I suspect the answer is "yes".  However if I
knew the algorithm you were using, could I decrypt the message without
the use of the "OTP" key?  I don't know the answer to this question.
I hope the answer is no.  Assuming it is no, then I ask you: when can
I see the algorithm you are using.  Following is an example of why
knowledge of the algorithm is useful but not harmful:
Example: Let's assume I can securely exchange a "OTP" (key) with
someone.  I now run some algorithm using that "OTP", add in the
plaintext, and out comes a random stream which is the encrypted
message.  Is this similar to what POTP does?  I believe the answer is
"yes".  Let me submit that what I described here I can do with DES
using ofb mode to generate a random number stream with which I encrypt
the message.  The fact that I know I used DES does not help me decrypt
the message.  I still need the "OTP" key in order to figure out which
stream of random bits were used to encrypt the message.
Actually, this statement is false.  What you have is a pseudo one-time
pad, not a true one-time pad.  It's close, though.  The problem is
that the means that you use to convert the smaller OTP to a larger OTP
may be "flawed", and that is the algorithm that I think most people
here want to see.  I do believe that the 5600-bit OTP key material
that you distribute is random.  You claim it is hardware generated; I
believe that.  However that doesn't help me feel any less wary about
the algorithm you use to convert that 5600-bit OTP to a larger
pseudo-random stream.
At best, you have a cipher with a 5600-bit key.  If this is so, I
congratulate you on it.  However I think that I, and others on this
list, would like to see how it is accomplished.  This is mostly
because I believe people here are wary of such systems; key management
and random number generation is a tricky business, and its very easy
to make a slip and get it wrong.  Just look at Netscape and other
systems which have fallen to simple attacks.
I think that people here would like to prove whether or not your
system is vulnerable to such attacks.  Just remember that if it is not
vulnerable, as you claim, then you have nothing to worry aout and you
will gain the acknowledgement of the cypherpunks behind you.  On the
other hand, wouldn't you rather that you know if your system has a
flaw, rather than having some cracker discover it and try to exploit
it rather than inform you?  That is a choice you will have to make.
I believe the cypherpunks offer still stands:  to test your algorithm.
The choice is yours.

IMHO, yes.  Consider for a minute: there are currently about 20000 PGP

those keys.  The keyrings are already 8MB or more.
Now, consider adding a URL to every signature.  Lets even use your

length byte).  Adding this URL to 30000 signatures would add 1050000
bytes, or just over 1MB.  This is an increase in 12% of the keyrings!
On the other hand, using my method and your "URL" (clark.net) would
add only 10 bytes per sig, or 300k.  This is only a 4% increase.

Although there is always the possibility that PGP could be broken, it
is highly unlikely that the program as a whole has been broken.  I

Also, if it is the DoD that is purporting this supposed break, I doubt
the public will ever hear about it.  It would be interesting to know
"how" PGP was supposedly broken.  Was a cryptographic routine broken,
or was it a user interface break?  I.e., was a signature forged or a
message decrypted?  Or was an old message replayed as a new one?
Also, it could be that a small PGP key has been broken.  A 384-bit PGP
key has already been broken by a factoring attack.  That is neither
surprising nor alarming to say the least.  Without more information it

@_subject: Security of PGP if Secret Key Available? 
The security of the PGP system is based around the security of the PGP
private (secret) key.  The security of the secret key is based on two
things: 1) The bits in the secring, and 2) the user pass phrase.  An
attacker needs both 1 and 2 to compromise a secret key.  Posession of
only one of them is not enough.  It doesn't matter how big your key
is.  It could be 384 bits, it could be 2048 bits.  You still have the
same two walls protecting your key.
If someone has read your secring file, that means they only have to
get your pass phrase.  This gives an attacker something to go for.
Once they obtain your pass phrase as well, your key is compromised.
If, however, they obtain your secret keyring but they CANNOT obtain
your pass phrase, you are still safe.  It just means you have one fewer
walls surrounding your secret key.
I always assume that someone has compromised my secret keyring, in
that someone has obtained a copy of it.  So I spend most of my "time"
(granted, it's not a lot) trying to protect my pass phrase.  I have a
fairly long pass phrase, more than 40 characters, and I make sure I
KNOW (not believe, KNOW) the path the bits take from the keyboard to
the CPU -- and I make sure that path is secure.  Otherwise I don't run
PGP at that time.
Since I have a laptop, that makes my life much easier -- I

Perhaps you misunderstood what I mean by "central keyserver model".
What I mean by that is the status quo, where we have a set of central
keyservers and each keyserver knows about each key.  When I say that
this will disappear, I mean that we will move towards a more
distributed system, similar to the DNS for looking up hostnames.  Yes,
we will need a distributed, hierarchial [sic] system in the future,
and if we want to continue using PGP we will need to provide a simpler
way to use that.
This is true.
I disagree.  I know the addresses of the people with whom I
communicate regularly.  I know my parent's USnail address, my
grandparents', my SO's, etc.  I dont need to tell the Post Office
"Send this to my parents" and trust them to do it.  I give them a
destination address and trust them to send it to the proper
destination.  The same thing is true in the electronic world.  I put a
destination on the email, give it to the mailer, and trust it to send
it to the appropriate destination.
A similar anology can be made when I dont know an address: I ask
someone for it.  Same thing with an email address/PGP key, I need to
ask for it before I can use it.
The same thing is true of hostnames.  I can find a hostname<->IP
address for just about any host on the planet.  Do I have them all on
my local disk?  No, of course not.  I look them up when I need them.
However, I do cache local copies of the names I frequently use.
Yes, this is true.  And it is used -- its called regional phone books.
If I want to get a number for someone, I go to the regional phone book
and look them up.  I have to know something about them first, so I
know where to look.  If I asked you to find the machine
"incommunicado" and tell me it's IP address, what would you do?  You'd
have to look in every domain for machines named "incommunicado".
However, if you knew that I meant "in the 'ihtfp.org' domain", you'd
know exactly where to look.  The same is true of phone numbers.  The
same is true for keys.
True.  The problem is that with PGP messages, the only information
about keys is a "random" keyID.  From a keyID there is no way to
determine that key unless you already have it.  This means that if you
do not already have the key, you have no way to find that key.  See
the problem?  This is like the "find 'incommunicado'" problem above.
What I propose is to modify, slightly, the PGP signature certificate
to add a "hint" field.  This hint field would tell you where to look
for the key.  This is the way to add the "ihtfp.org" info to the
PGP signature.

contain some informatin that hints at the location of the key.  On the
other hand, you dont want to bloat the signature in doing this.
So, there needs to be a compromise, some shorthand method to describe
the hint.  One solution is to provide a "keyserver" type and then some
string that says which "keyserver" to use.  For example, if there is a
DNS-style keyserver deplyed, I could put '1,"mit.edu"' in all my
signatures, if we assume that '1' is the DNS-style keyserver code.
I'm sure there are other possible solutions as well, and any real
suggestions are welcome.

Just a quick clarification...
The printable part of the keyid is 8 hexes long.  The internal keyID
that PGP uses for choosing keys is actually 8 bytes, not 8 hexes.
Besides, its not the length that matters, but the security.

@_subject: Signature 2 
Unforutnately both of your assumptions are wrong.  A key cannot be
100% uncrackable, and a signature cannot be 100% immune to fraud.
With electronic security, there is always a chance that a key can be
cracked or a signature forged.  The question is how hard is it to
crack the key or forge the signature?  You need to balance the
security with the price.
For example, a 1024-bit RSA key cannot be cracked, today, in a
reasonable amount of time.  However it is unclear how long that will
last.  Look at RSA-129; in 1977 Ron Rivest said it would take 40
quadrillion years to break the key.  In 1993-4 it took 8 months (5000
A key has a limited size, therefore it is theoretically possible to
try every single key (this is called brute-force).  Therefore it is
impossible to have 100% uncrackable keys.  Singatures have the same

@_subject: PGP reveals the key ID of the recipient of encrypted msg 
Unfortunately, PGP 2.6.2 will do this only if the PGP message has
proper keyIDs.  It finds the proper key by matching the keyID in the
PGP message to the keyIDs in the secret keyring.  If you remove the
keyIDs from the message (as stealth does), PGP 2.6.2 cannot find the
secret key to use.
One fix would be to have PGP (say, PGP3 ;) try all the keys on your
secret keyring if the keyID in the message is 0.  In other words, you
can pseudo-stealth a message by leaving off the keyID and PGP3 would
attempt all the secret keys.  If one worked, you'd be able to read it.
This doesn't solve the whole problem of stealth; you still know that
what you have is a PGP message, and even that it is an encrypted
message, but you do not know to whom it has been encrypted.  The nice
thing about this approach is that this works for multiple recipients,
NOTE: while the PGP3 API should be able to handle this case, I do not
know if support for this feature will be implemented in PGP 3.0

You don't.  Blind signatures only work with "pure" RSA.  You cannot
use PKCS encoding to perform blind signatures.  PKCS nullifies the
multiplicity that is required for these blinding techniques to work.

It is legal to export full DES, in binary form, to banks outside the
US.  In other words, a company in the US can create a financial
package that uses DES, even for encryption, and sell it to a bank
outside the US.  THe caveat is that DES can only be used to encrypt
the financial transactions, not arbitrary data.

@_subject: Senator Leahy's Public Key 
This is exactly what the web of trust is about.  The fact is that you
can't trust the Keyservers (they were never designed to be trusted);
you can't trust .plan files; you can't trust index.html files.
However you can trust signatures made by trusted keys.  That is why
the web of trust works.
For example, I've met in person with a lot of people and we've signed
each others' keys.  We've used various methods to "prove" identity.
Sometimes it's been a long time of personal interactions (close
friends).  Sometimes it's been a number of certifying documents, IDs,
etc.  Sometimes it's been a piece of knowledge that I know the other
has but no one else has.
The point is that once I'm attached to the web of trust I have a means
to verify other keys.  I can set up a CA that way (MIT has one) --
there is a keysigner that will use out-of-band means to verify the
identity of a user and then use that to sign a PGP key in that
person's name.
As I said already, the keyservers are not bulletproof.  In fact, they
were never designed to be trusted.  They were designed to be an
untrusted key distribution system.  The end-user is still supposed to
verify the signatures on they keys received from the keyserver.
As for calling up Joe Schmoe, how did you get his number?  Did you
look it up in a phone book?  Call directory assistance?  These are
other means of identification, too.
You just need to look at it from a different angle.

This is really exagerating.  You do not need a 4.0, 1600, etc. to be
admitted to MIT.  Sure, you need good grades, but a 3.6 average and
1350-1400 SAT scores is perfectly adequate to be admitted to MIT.  You
can think of being admitted with even lower scores, if you stand out
in some way.  MIT admissions looks for well-rounded students.  You're
much better off being a writer/artist/musician than being on the
science or math teams.
It may be alot, but then again MIT is one of the best schools in the
world (I'm not going to be egotistical enough to say it *is* the best,
even tho Consumer Reports rated it such for the last N years).
This is untrue.  The computer science department at MIT is really
good.  As are the sciences, and even business!  The MIT Sloan School
(Management and Economics) was rated  last year.  The EECS
department (EE and CS are together) is top notch, too.
When I looked at Caltech, their Engineering (and computer science)
really lacked.  They were excellent for the Sciences (Math, Physics,
Chemistry, etc.) but their engineering school wasn't as good as others
I was looking at (both EE and CS).  Things may have changed in the
last 8 years, however.
Spyking, my advise to you: Look around at many schools.  Go visit
them.  Talk to the students there.  Talk to the professors.  Talk to
graduates.  The more information you and your son have, the better
decisions you and he can make.
Personally, I loved MIT -- it was the right place for me.  It isn't
the right place for everyone.  Make sure it is the right place for
your son before he applies.  For what it's worth, I wanted to go to
MIT my sophomore year in high school, too ;)

Granted, ISDN gives you only twice that of a 56k modem (ISDN gives you

latency of analog modems is as high as 300ms, whereas the latency of
an ISDN link is about 10% of that.  MUCH better for real-time
interactive connections.
It all depends on how you define "performance".  If you really want
good performance, get MediaOne, RoadRunner, of  service.

The big issue I see with GPL and Crypto software is that with the GPL

due to the United States export rules, I cannot export Crypto
software, which means I must legally put a restriction on any Crypto

GPL is concerned.  This, in turn, means I cannot use the GPL for

At which point no, it doesn't make sense to develop an even better
lock until you come up with better doors. :)
