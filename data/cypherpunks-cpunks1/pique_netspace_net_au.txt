I think all this concern about voter coercion is rather overblown. Maybe we should ban bank statements because people might be coerced into showing them to someone and punished for hiding their money. Receipts might open up opportunities for voter coercion but there are mechanisms for combatting coercion other than coercive anonymity.
What is missing in this discussion is mention of the benefits which would flow from making voter anonymity optional. Non-anonymous voting is a necessary precondition for a vote market. As I'm sure everyone on this list appreciates, markets work better than elections, and indeed, under a vote market system the negative externalities imposed on other markets by the electoral process would be mitigated. This is because unlike under the current system, under the vote market system the outcome would often be certain well in advance, greatly reducing the impact of political risk on markets. The vote market system would also offer a means for mitigating political risk via transparent market processes rather than the through the current rather slezy practises.
There would be social dividends too. The people most likely to sell their vote would be poor people who would benefit from a new and regular source of income. The existence of a vote market would encourage these people, who often feel disenfranchised, to participate in the electoral system, albeit in a venal way. It would also help increase the average intelligence of the vote, because rich people and corporations are generally smarter than poor I commend the vote market to the list.

I'm glad someone liked it. The voting thread seemed mainly about achieving 19th century ideals with 21st century technology. But it seemed to me as coercively non-libertarian to forcibly prevent people from verifiably revealing their vote as it is to do the opposite. Sometimes you don't want to be anonymous.
Yes, but the "optional obedience" model is what we have now, and it's obviously very inefficient. It leads to large amounts of private and common property being squandered in an effort to buy the votes of people who often don't even bother turning up of for work. My plan was to let people sell their vote before the election. I'll leave designing a scheme by which this can be done anonymously online to the lists crypto-mavens.
How much to the parties spend on campaigns now? They should be willing to spend more on buying votes, because a bought vote is a much better product. How much they would *have* to spend would depend on the market, but the greater efficiency a vote market would attract more buyers, so it's reasonable to assume that the cost of buying an election would go up.
If a company pays no dividends and returns no capital to its shareholders, then control's the only source of value for the shares. At least that's what my theory tells me (fair value is net present value of income produced by the asset + value of "externalities"), but there are shares that trade at nonzero prices which pay no dividends, return no capital, and have control locked up. I've never been able to work this out.

More benefits of the vote buying scheme are being discovered daily. Maybe it could be trialled at a local level in the US. You could get it started with one of those proposition thingies you have over there. It shouldn't be difficult - how much would it cost to get someone to sign a petition?

You could make giving enforceable promises an option for candidates -- something like "If I can't cut taxes in my first term I will eat my hat" or "... I'll owe everyone with a voting receipt with my name on it $100". Then there'd be pressure on candidates to boost their credibilty by making enforceable promises instead of "empty" ones. Secondly you could get around the problems induced by the labyrinthine checks and balances of the US system by tying the liability to measurable behaviors. The president either vetos a certain bill or fails to; a senator or representative either introduces a certain bill or fails to. As long as the bill is specifically identifiable in advance there isn't a great deal of wriggle room.
A third alternative is to remove the politiican from the loop. At the same time you vote for candidates, you vote for propositions which become law if approved by a majority of those voting. The problem is who gets to decide what's proposed. Alternatively  groups of candidates (e.g. parties) could be able to codify their promises as bills before the election. If a enough candidates who subscribed to the relevant platform get elected, then they're deemed to have voted for the bill already in their official capacity as senator or whatever.

I'm not in favor of compulsory voting, but you wont have to pay the small fine unless you're too lazy to think of an excuse. Last time I got off by claiming my foot was too sore to walk to the polling station. In practice it's only compulsory to either apply for an absentee vote or attend a polling station on election day and get your name crossed off a list. You can bin the pieces of paper the official gives you.
The effect is that about 70% of voters just turn up and vote the way "their" party tells them to vote. This number is in secular decline.
I think what's needed is a "None of the above" option on the ballot. If "None of the above" won a majority then the office would be left vacant. (We actually had this system for student elections at my alma mater) Non-voters obviously aren't sufficiently attracted to any of the candidates to bother voting, so they should be counted as votes for "None of the above" (but not this part -- they were doing well to get a 10% turn-out for a student election). Pretty soon we'd have no government.

Doesn't the commentary have equal if not superior status?
Sanhedrin 59a I took the trouble to look up. In fact it says that a non-Jew who studies the Torah deserves death. It also says he is a "High Priest" and rounds off with a discussion of which animals one may cut living parts from and eat.
Whether googling the rabbinical Law qualifies me for the death penalty is

(1) You'll never eliminate cheating.
(2) Making the size of the history file a secret is probably unworkable. Better to make deletion from the history non-deterministic, so the longer a record has been been in the list the more likely it is to get dropped. A potential cheater would never be certain when the incriminating evidence would be gone. If which records were disreputable was known then their lifetime could be

A long, long time agob&
I can still remember
How the dollar used to make me smile.
And I knew if I had my chance
I'd sell the currency of France
And, maybe, I'd be happy for awhile.
But all our spending made me shiver
With every T-bill we'd deliver.
Bad news on the doorstep;
I couldn't take one more step.
I can't remember if I cried
When I heard our politicians lied
But something touched me deep inside
The day the dollar died.
So bye-bye, dollar assets good-bye
Sold my Chevy at the levee
'cause my pension ran dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin' sake to try
Singin' this'll be the day that it died
This'll be the day that it died.
Did you write Whitehouse.gov
Or have you a Yen to fall in love
If Japan will tell you so?
Now, do you believe in oil 'n coal
Can China fill our import hole
And can we teach them how to grow real slow?
Well I know the country's fit and trim
'Cause the jobs are in the Pacific Rim.
We all knew savers lose
Man, I dug not having to choose.    We were living off the almighty buck
We got their goods and they were stuck
But I knew we were out of luck
The day the dollar died.
I started singin'
Bye-bye, dollar assets good-bye
Sold my Chevy at the levee
'cause my pension ran dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin' sake to try
Singin' this'll be the day that it died
This'll be the day that it died.
Now for ten years we were sure we owned
All the stocks and bonds and mortgage loans
But that's not how it's gonna be.
When we've spent it all like kings and queens
In clothes we bought from The Philippines
The Asians pick the reserve currency. Oh, and while the king was looking down,
Their central bankers came to town. Our stocks and bonds were spurned Those dollars were returned.
And while unions filled their books with Marx
The President said drill in parks
Our thermostats froze in the dark
The day the dollar died.
We were singin'
Bye-bye, dollar assets good-bye
Sold my Chevy at the levee
'cause my pension ran dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin' sake to try
Singin' this'll be the day that it died
This'll be the day that it died.
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The equity's gone from your leveraged shelter
Fannie and Freddie are falling fast.
Crash, they landed, but in a new class
Full faith and credit have long since passed
With Congress, in denial, out of gas. Now the Wal-Mart there has cheap perfume
With imports filling every room.
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance.
The consumers tried to take the field
The central banks refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the dollar died?
We started singin'
Bye-bye, dollar assets good-bye
Sold my Chevy at the levee
'cause my pension ran dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin' sake to try
Singin' this'll be the day that it died
This'll be the day that it died.
Oh, and there we were all in one place
Our credit rating in disgrace
With no time left to start again.
So come on: Al be nimble, Al be quick!
Al, cut rates by 50 ticks
'cause credit is the debtor's only friend.
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No congressman in hell
Could buy what he would sell.
And as the rates climbed high into the night
To stem the U.S. asset flight
The IMF said, "Yes, that's right"
The day the dollar died
They were singin'
Bye-bye, dollar assets good-bye
Sold my Chevy at the levee
'cause my pension ran dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin' sake to try
Singin' this'll be the day that it died
This'll be the day that it died.
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her if we still could choose
But she just smiled and turned away.
I went down to the Medicare store
Where we'd spent our dollars years before
But the man there said those dollars wouldn't pay.
And in the streets the children screamed
The seniors cried and the workers steamed
But not a word was spoken
The commitments all were broken.
And the three men I admire most:
Faber, Rogers, and Bill Gross
Were at the forex trading post
The day the dollar died.
And they were singin'
Bye-bye, dollar assets good-bye
Sold my Chevy at the levee
'cause my pension ran dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin' sake to try
Singin' this'll be the day that it died
This'll be the day that it died.
They were singin'
Bye-bye, dollar assets good-bye
Sold my Chevy at the levee
'cause my pension ran dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin' sake to try
Singin' this'll be the day that it died.
