          News/Assignment Editors & Sports Writers
IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 2, 2001--Grand Prix Sports Inc.
(OTC BB:GPRX) announced that it has won both the FIA Formula 3000
International Team Championship and Drivers' Championship for the
2001 season. Coca-Cola Nordic Racing secured the Team Championship
with two races remaining in the 2001 season and has set new team
records for the most podium appearances and team points of any team
since 1985. Appropriately, Coca-Cola Europe Ltd. has extended its
title sponsorship for Nordic Racing for an additional two years.
Coca-Cola Nordic Racing driver Justin Wilson also won the prestigious
Drivers' Championship while teammate Tomas Enge finished in a tie
for second place. Wilson became the first-ever British driver to win
the Drivers' Title and with a 71 point total, eclipsed the all time
single season points record previously held by Formula 1 driver Juan
Pablo Montoya. Enge missed the last F3000 race at Monza, Italy after
being chosen by the Prost Formula 1 team to replace the injured
Luciano Burti for the last three Formula 1 races. Enge successfully
competed in the Italian, American and Japanese Grand Prixes to
finish the Formula 1 season with Prost.
"Obviously, this is the utmost achievement in Formula 3000," stated
Team Principal, Derek Mower. "To win both of these titles is a
testament to the strength of our race team and the support of
sponsors like Coca-Cola and Conoco. Together, we're effectively
tapping into the enormous popularity of global motor sports."
Grand Prix Sports owns 40% of Coca-Cola Nordic Racing and is the
first publicly traded race team in the Formula world, allowing
fans of Formula racing, by and large the world's most popular sport,
the unique opportunity to "own" part of a race team.

           In the light of the U.S. reliance on foreign oil in
                          this troubled world,
          domestic oil refineries are constantly strengthening

          in accord with the energy policy of President Bush
          As one analyst said, "No more being held as a hostage
                               for oil."

        Friday November 9, 7:33 pm Eastern Time

            Global Oil Supply Uncertainty Raises Interest in
         American Oil Producers; Gulftex Oil Ready to Assist in
                             Meeting Demand
        HOUSTON, Nov. 9 /PRNewswire/ -- Tensions in the oil
        rich Middle East have renewed interest in American oil
        reserves and domestic producers such as Gulftex Energy
        Corporation (OTC Bulletin Board: GTXE - news).
        In an ABC News report October 22, 2001, the network
        quoted Merrill Lynch analyst Steven Pfiefer as stating,
        ``It is quite feasible that we could see prices rise if
        conditions overseas escalate in some form,'' adding
        that Pfeifer and several other analysts are predicting
        higher oil prices similar to what the U.S. experienced
        during the 1970s when restrained production from OPEC
        and military and political volatility in the Middle
        East led to skyrocketing oil prices and fuel costs.
        Heightening fears of a diminished oil supply are U.S.
        Government suggestions that the ``War on Terrorism''
        could extend to other nations beyond Afghanistan, some
        of which may be OPEC nations or allies of OPEC
        countries. The effect of such action could ``abruptly
        change'' the output from OPEC according to the ABC
        report. OPEC meets again in Vienna on November 14,
        2001.
        Moreover, ABC states that U.S. ally Saudi Arabia
        produces more than double the oil production of the
        rest of the world combined and as a potential target of
        exiled Saudi Osama Bin Laden, a ``nightmare scenario''
        would be a successful attack on that oil supply or its
        distributing ports.
        Amid these fears, interest has risen in domestic oil
        suppliers such as Gulftex Energy Corporation, a Houston
        based integrated petroleum company involved in
        exploration and production, transportation, refining,
        and retail marketing. The company develops and manages
        oil and gas fields, focusing on the Permian Basin in
        New Mexico and Texas, onshore United States Gulf Coast,
        and the Gulf of Mexico, offshore in Indonesia, Nigeria
        and Qatar. The Company is also involved in pipeline
        transportation, oil & refined products trading, and
        shipping.
        The ABC report also states that an alternative to
        Middle Eastern oil dependence is to develop existing
        oil resources within the United States. The U.S. Energy
        Department is expected to unveil a report soon
        outlining the benefits of developing and expanding
        domestic oil reserves, including bumping up the
        strategic reserve, again, according to the report.
        Earlier this year amid threats of rolling blackouts,
        President Bush and U.S. Dept. of Energy's Spencer
        Abraham repeatedly called for increased domestic
        drilling.
        ``We're looking forward to an increase in incentives
        for domestic oil exploration and production,'' said
        Marc Duchesne, president of Gulftex Energy Corporation.
        ``We will be making some dramatic announcements in the
        very near future regarding the acquisition of large oil
        and gas properties in the United States. Stay tuned.''
        Gulftex Energy Corporation is an integrated petroleum
        company involved in exploration and production,
        transportation, refining, and retail marketing. The
        Company develops and manages oil and gas fields,
        focusing on New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Kentucky plus
        onshore United States Gulf Coast and the Gulf of
        Mexico, including offshore. The Company is also
        involved in pipeline transportation, oil & refined

          Today's Featured Company is BioSecure (OTCBB: YCCI)
               (Presently Known As Yes Clothing Co.  Inc)
          As company's inevitably succeed or fail in the
          publicly traded arena, their listings are often
          acquired by new companies in what is known as a
          reverse merger. In this instance, BioSecure has
          acquired the "shell" of Yes Clothing Co. for its own
          purposes.  Obviously, Yes Clothing Co. is no longer
          an active part of this publicly traded vehicle and
          the stock symbol (YCCI) is now reflective of the
          business plan of BioSecure Corporation.

          Effective personal protection is essential to any
          person who may be exposed to potentially hazardous
          substances. Since the Sepember 11th attacks changed
          our lives forever, many believe that situations may
          arise when people at home or work may be exposed to
          bio-hazards. BioSecure will develop, license,
          purchase, and market bio-technical products to
          consumers and businesses to assist in preventing or
          minimalizing any exposure to harmful biological or
          chemical agents.

                     Bio-Hazard Protection Products
          NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 16,
          2001--Yes Clothing Company Inc. (OTCBB:YCCI - news)
          today announced that the company's board of directors
          has approved the company's name change from Yes
          Clothing Company Inc. to BioSecure Corp.
          The company intends to identify and develop, license,
          purchase and market bio-technical and other personal
          protection products under the name BioSecure Corp.
          The name change resolution adopted by the board will
          be submitted to the Securities and Exchange
          Commission and
          shareholders in accordance with the current proxy
          rules, within the next few weeks.
          All shareholders of record will receive instructions
          on where to send their existing certificates in
          exchange for new certificates.  Subject to approval,
          the company will effect its name change, a
          corresponding change of CUSIP number and a change in
          the trading symbol within the next 60 days.
          ``The name change will effectively separate the
          company's historical business from its future
          activities,'' said Jon Lawver, corporate secretary
          and director of Yes Clothing. ``The board is
          enthusiastic about entering this market at a time
          when the world is on heightened alert and there is an
          obvious need for personal protection products.
          ``The BioSecure name will better represent the
          personal protection products the company will be
          developing and marketing.  The recent bio-terrorism
          events have made it clear that hazardous materials
          are now part of our daily lives and BioSecure
          products will be introduced to address everything
          from anthrax to the more mundane bio-hazards that
          exist in every business and residence, like copier
          toner and cleaning products.''

  The recent anthrax scares have led to a handful of companies being
discovered that have products   available that test and disinfect antimicrobial agents. Vital Living
Products (OTC BB: VLPI) recently   announced it had developed home testing kits for Anthrax and the stock
soared to a 52-week high on   Monday with shares climbing from $0.06 to $2.00. Another company,
Veridien (OTC BB: VRDE)   announced that its sanitizing and disinfecting products are designed
to stop or slow and control   environmental challenges and the stock jumped from $0.05 to $0.13.
Other companies like   eSAFETYWORLD, Cepheid, Vital Living, and Ozolutions, and InVision
Technologies have emerged and   shareholders have been rewarded in this era of fears for personal
safety. Some are calling it the "Anthrax   Bubble."
     WHAT COMPANY WILL BE NEXT IN CONFRONTING BIOLOGICAL THREATS ?
  Who will be the next leader in eradicating bacteria and preventing
biological risks? There is a great deal of investment speculation.
  TRSG Corp. is a leader in selling neutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals,
and health and dietary supplements in   the U.S. and Japan.  The following is an excerpt from a BusinessWire
news release issued today:
        ------  Handheld Anthrax Detection Device -- $50-$100 Price Tag
  *** TRSG ANNOUNCES NEW PRODUCT LINE ***
  LAS VEGAS--Oct. 25, 2001--TRSG Corp. (OTC BB: TSGO), a majority-owned
subsidiary of   Gateway Distributors Ltd., Thursday announced it has entered into a
preliminary agreement to acquire   certain assets of Mobility Solutions Inc.  These assets include the
Rest Assured Product Line of hand-held,   low-cost devices used to detect the presence of biological agents such
as Bacillus Anthraci (commonly   referred to as Anthrax) as well as many other biological agents.
  The Rest Assured Biological Agent Detection Product line utilizes UV-A
waves or waves in the 320 to   380 nm range, commonly referred to as black light or wood's light,
that have been determined to not cause   sunburn to human skin though the use of eye protection is recommended
during use. These products are   for detection purposes only and are not intended as a treatment or
cure for any specific disease.
  Ongoing research is being conducted at this time to verify the
product's effectiveness in the use of   identifying the presence of a wide range of biological agents such as
Becillus Anthraci, which is currently   making headlines throughout the world. Independent research
laboratories are conducting this research.

        In the Spring of this year, Stockupticks brought you
        the story of a small-cap company that produced firearm
        safety and security products. That company,
        Saf-T-Hammer (OTC BB: SAFH) later acquired legendary
        gun manufacturer Smith & Wesson. One of the products in
        development at that time was a gun made from a new,
        lightweight, exotic-metal alloy making the gun easier
        to carry and conceal. Due to interest in using this
        weapon for arming flight crews on commercial airliners,
        the dealer response has been tremendous.

                 Lightweight revolvers hot item for S&W
          Wednesday, October 24, 2001
          By WILLIAM FREEBAIRN
          A new line of ultra-light revolvers in stores this
          month is proving a success for Smith & Wesson, which
          can't keep up with demand. The new guns are among the
          first in the world to use scandium, a metal that has
          been used in Russian fighter jets and baseball bats.
          They are being marketed under the AirLite Sc label
          and all are capable of firing a powerful .357-caliber
          Magnum round that had been previously unavailable in
          such a lightweight gun.
          The smaller revolvers, which weight just over 11
          ounces, have been shipping for several weeks; larger
          guns should reach dealers in the coming days.
          "It's a hot item," said Herb A. Belin, handgun
          product manager for Smith & Wesson. "Our constraint
          is our production rate." The guns are more expensive
          than stainless-steel revolvers. New guns carry a
          suggested price of between $700 and $800 each.
          The lighter guns are likely to be purchased by people
          who want them for personal defense, especially those
          with permits to carry concealed weapons, Belin said.
          Officials said developing the guns using the new
          metal took longer than expected and taught them some
          lessons in metallurgy. In high-speed video footage of
          the gun firing, the frame and barrel moved
          dramatically due to the scandium alloy's flexibility.
          "That gun does the rumba," Belin said.
          Designers increased the size of some parts of the gun
          to reduce flexing. Titanium was used in the cylinder
          for strength, but testing showed it was also needed
          in the center pin and other parts of the weapon.
          Steel is used for the hammer and trigger. "This
          taught us to make even stronger, tougher guns," Belin
          said.
          Scandium is a little-known metal that occupies a
          place on the periodic table immediately before
          titanium. Discovered in the late 1800s, it found use
          in the former Soviet Union, which had a virtual
          monopoly on the supply from the Ukraine. The Soviets
          used it in fighter jets and missile parts. When the
          Soviet Union broke up, the metal began to see more
          widespread use, for example in aluminum baseball bats
          and mountain bike frames.
          Although scandium costs about $7,000 a pound, the
          amount needed to mix with aluminum and other alloying
          agents is small. Adding a little scandium to aluminum
          strengthens the material more than twofold, Belin
          said.
          Its weight will increase the number of people willing
          to carry it, Belin said. "You don't need a holster.
          You can carry it in your pocket."
          The lightest of the scandium guns is less than half
          of the weight of the lightest .357-caliber Magnum the
          company made before. Because of their light weight
          and flexible scandium-aluminum alloy frame, the guns
          deliver a rapid "kick" to the hands of the person
          firing them. "Recoil is an issue," Belin said.
          The gun can fire less-powerful rounds than the .357
          magnum, for example the .38 special, that can reduce
          recoil. "You really have to work at not flinching
          (when firing,)" Belin said.
          Smith & Wesson officials believe there may be another
          market for the super-light guns. They have developed
          a prototype scandium alloy gun that could be carried
          by flight crews on commercial airliners. There have
          been calls for flight crews to be armed, although no
          steps have been taken by the government in that
          direction.
          The Smith & Wesson prototypes are black with an
          internal hammer, so they could be carried in a
          trouser or jacket pocket without catching on the
          fabric. The guns could be modified to fire a
          lower-velocity round, which is less likely to cause
          damage to an aircraft, officials said.
          The prototype air crew guns have not been publicly
          revealed before, Belin said. A spokesman said the
          prototypes are simply a design concept and will not
          necessarily be produced or be shared with people
          outside the company.
