^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Are there any plans to port JAVA to a REAL operating system?  Support
for crypto needs to be ubiquitous to work.  Start with the fanatics
(Linux and FreeBSD) and the other platforms will quickly follow (often
ported by the afore mentioned fanatics so that the departmental server
can run the same code as their desktop box :-).
