Tom Vogt pointed out in a follow-up email that 'CORE' should be replaced with 'InterNIC'.  CORE as the registrar actually still had
the name listed.
Nevertheless, what has happened here demonstrates a basic flaw at the
heart of the domain name system.  ICANN and many essential Internet
resources remain subject to US jurisdiction.  ICANN itself is just a
California corporation, so it is subject to the passing whims of the
California legislature as well as those of Congress, the executive
branches, and various and sundry US state and federal courts.  Some argue that ICANN should itself have authority over all of the
Internet domain name system and the IP address space and in fact things are creeping in this direction.  Given the now-crucial role that the Internet plays in the global economy, ICANN's hegemony gives, for example, representatives of small towns in California sitting
on the right committee in Sacramento remarkable and truly unique power
over the rest of the planet.

I didn't say that this was the whole problem.  I said that it demonstrated a (one) basic flaw.  On the other hand, I didn't say
that the problem simply involved US law.  In this case the problem
seemed to be pressure from the executive branch.
There is a very large world outside of the United States.  There is no reason why issues involving .UK, for example, should be subject to the jurisdiction of California courts.  Britain is not a colony
of the United States, nor is it a California county.
Nor is there any justification for US government control over the
allocation of IP address space within Europe.  But when you look closely at ICANN, this is what you are getting.
ICANN was supposed to replace IANA.  IANA had a narrow technical role
that depended upon voluntary cooperation.  Having IANA arbitrate decisions about .UK actually worked, because IANA did not claim any
ultimate legal authority.  It was just obvious to everyone that if
they didn't cooperate the Internet would not work.
It may seem odd, but because IANA was gossamer thin, it had real power and legitimacy.  ICANN doesn't and shouldn't.
ICANN is a California corporation subject to state and US laws.  It
has an obligation to obey those laws.  There is or should be no question about this.  ICANN is after all a legal fiction, a body whose very existence rests upon the authority of the state of The question is whether the domain name system, the IP address space, and other fundamental Internet infrastructure should be subject
to US and California law.  These are global, not local, resources.

@_subject: CDR: Re: Carnivore All-Consuming 
Carnivore is an NT-based PC.  How could it conceivably process all
communications through even a mid-sized ISP?
There are at least two problems: processing power and network As regards the first, our customers, many of them smaller ISPs, find it necessary to employ NT clusters to handle subsets of their
traffic (Usenet news, Web proxies, and so forth).  So it is difficult to believe that a single NT box could monitor their entire traffic load.
As regards the second, most ISPs of any size have multiple PoPs
and multiple high-speed connections to other networks.  It would require incredible contortions to route all of their traffic to one point for monitoring.  And for the larger network, the bandwidth
into that single point would be unmanageable.  The UK government proposed building something more sophisticated than Carnivore.  Consultants led them to believe that this was feasible,
and costed a solution.  The UK ISP associations (the LINX and ISPA)
replied to their proposals by saying that (a) the proposals showed
no understanding of the technical structure of the Internet and (b) their cost estimates were ridiculously low, even if the Internet could be distorted sufficiently to be monitored in the manner envisioned.
As far as we can see, the UK government as an institution is not capable of even understanding the Internet.  They simply do not have
enough competent technical staff.  They do have a lot of relatively
senior people who claim to be competent - and give bad advice, some
of which finds its way into legislation and programs of action.
The overall capacity and the complexity of the Internet is increasing
at an explosive rate.  For better or for worse, this far exceeds the
growth in any government's capability of monitoring Internet traffic.

First, like any other manufacturer's claims, these should be treated
with some skepticism.
Second, this is an intrusion detection system.  I suspect that they
are looking for something simpler than what Carnivore is trying to Third, even if you believe that they can really analyse data at 100 Mbps, this still doesn't give them the ability to handle more than one PoP with two DS3 connections.  This is still orders of magnitude away from being able to handle a major site with multiple 2.5G connections, let alone all of the traffic handled by a major ISP.
The original claim was that Carnivore could monitor all of an ISP's traffic.  This isn't true for most ISPs.  And the amazing growth rates that we are seeing in bandwidth and network complexity make it
exceedingly unlikely that Carnivore or anything like it will ever catch up.
Qwest deployed 14,000 miles of fibre some years ago.  This was
packaged as conduits carrying 48 fiber pairs, each pair using wave division multiplexing to carry 8 to 16 optical channels, with
each channel running at 10 Gbps.  That's 160 Gbps per fiber, 7,680 Gbps per conduit.  Qwest is one of many carriers.  160 Gbps
over a fiber pair isn't state of the art.  Qwest has many conduits.
If a PC can monitor 100M of bandwidth, it would take, uhm, about
seventy seven thousand PCs to monitor one of Qwest's conduits.  Not
that I believe that one PC can monitor traffic at 100 Mbps.

It's easy to look at history in this way, seeing some people as villians and other as victims.  But do remember that St Patrick wasn't Irish at all.  He was an English boy, stolen by Irish pirates
and sold into slavery in Ireland.  And for centuries English kings
used Irish mercenaries to subdue their unruly subjects.
But this is mostly just laziness.  When Patrick didn't do what he
was told, I'm sure that his masters made no effort to learn his
language.  They just shouted at him louder in Gaelic.

You are right.  I should have said that he was a British lad.
Several authorities, eg the Cathoic Encyclopedia, say that St Patrick
became fluent in the language of the Irish while in slavery.  Some
claim that he was born in Scotland, some say in Wales.  None support
your suggestion that the language of his masters was his native
tongue.  The real point here is that the Irish, generally portrayed as victims of the British, were sometimes victims, sometimes villians --
like most everybody else.  PS.  I am immensely fond of Ireland; me mother is Irish, in fact ;-)

There are a number of languages normally called Chinese that use the
same characters.  They are more or less mutually comprehensible when
written but not when spoken.  (Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien, Fukien, etc)  It takes some self-discipline to write Chinese that can be
understood by speakers of other dialects.
Vietnamese used to fall into this category before the French took over;
they now use a phonetic alphabet, the usual alphabet used by European languages with additional marks that make it phonetic.
Japanese, Korean, and possibly others use a mixture of the Chinese
characters and phonetic symbols.  In Japanese at least the phonetic
symbols form two syllabaries.  A syllabary is like an alphabet, but
instead of representing sounds a symbol represents a syllable.  So the Japanese syllabaries begin "kah, kee, koo, kay, koh, ..." Jim Dixon                  VBCnet GB Ltd           tel +44 117 929 1316                             fax +44 117 927 2015

The more common British term is "in hospital".  I don't recall
ever hearing anyone say "at hospital".
There are innumerable small distinctions in usage .  If you are in hospital, you are ill, not a member of the staff.  Your being ill may the result of an injury.  That is, the same
term covers both sicknesses and injuries.  If you are in hospital
because of a broken back, people will say that you are ill.
If you are sick, on the other hand, it means that you have vomited.
They aren't equivalent at all.  In the UK [young] children go to "school" and "college" generally refers to something very roughly equivalent to either an American senior high school or junior
college.  My company has university students spending a year or
so with us on placement; if you ask them when they are going back
to school, they tend to be offended, thinking you are poking fun at them.  Taking the mickey, that is.

Hardly.  A bazooka is a shoulder-held tube from which you fire a missile, the fuel in the missile burning as it goes through the air.
When the missile is gone, you put another one in.
A recoilless rifle fires a conventional artillery round.  The motive force is supplied by fuel which burns in the barrel of
the gun.  When you have fired, you open the little door at the
back, pull out the empty shell casing, and put in another one.
Depends on the war.  I believe that in Vietnam it was common to
mix beehive and HEAT 50:50.  Beehive rounds contain zillions of little darts about half an inch long.  HEAT is what you are talking
about - High Explosive Anti Tank.
Yes.  The gas comes out of the back of a recoilless rifle a lot faster than the shell goes out the front.

Anyone can find out what the numbers are?
A British doctor was jailed recently for murdering patients he believed shouldn't continue to live.  I don't recall how many murders he was convicted of, but it doesn't matter: estimates of
the total number killed are in the hundreds and climbing.  Very
few of these murders will enter any official statistics.
Since this came to light people in the UK have become much more skeptical about health professionals; police are investigating other
cases where death rates differ widely depending upon which staff are on duty.
These cases involve what is agreed to be murder.  It is certain
that the deaths of infants at the Bristol Royal Infirmary won't
be counted.  At BRI doctors kept on operating on children and were
allowed to do so even though they had an extraordinarily high death rate.  Colleagues warned them that their surgical procedures were ill-advised and they were widely known to be incompetent.  This went on for years.  Years.
A doctor joining the team in 1988 noticed the problem
and reported it, to no effect.  He began collecting evidence in
1992-3.  In 1993 he contacted the Department of Health and was told
that they had known about the problem before he joined.  In June 94 he requested a review of the results; this took seven months.  It was agreed that no more operations should be performed - but they continued to be performed until May 1995, when a new doctor took
over operations of this type and the death rate plummeted.
An offical inquiry started in October 1997.
29 deaths, 4 survivors with brain damage out of 53 operations.
Three surgeons found guilty, including the chief executive of the trust.  Two struck off, one suspended for three years.
The men involved knew that what they were doing was causing death.
They didn't care.  Other people knew the same.  They did nothing -
for years.  The results won't be counted as murder.
Then we have mass slaughter.  In Europe in the 20th century many
tens of millions have died in wars.  Most of these deaths were
calmly ordered by governments who fully understood what the effect
of their orders would be.  Murder on this scale is simply incomprehensible from a North American
