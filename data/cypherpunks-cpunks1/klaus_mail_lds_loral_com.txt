@_subject: chaos harnessed for encryption 
There is an article in some paper magazine (Technology) about
some research at MIT for creating a signal-processing designs
that use chaos to encrypt information. Voice telephone
would be an excellent use of this technology. Anyone
have more info on it?

@_subject: best way to check for modification of self 
I am looking for C src or algorithms that would be useful for a program
to check its own integrity and make sure it hasnt been modified.  Looking at the filesize of the file would not help, since I want to make
sure no one has modified just some text, etc.  I would like the algorithm
or code to be rather quick in doing the check in the initialization of
the program.  Would finding the src to CRC or sum and adding that into the
program be the best solution?
Has anyone else dealt with this?
