They probably are right :-) A daughter of the german PTT has been offering
ISDN-DES-phones for some years now. Welcome to the Club !

prepaid cards can be set up to work anonymously, sure. Unfortunately, the
one making this decision (the network operator) is more concerned with toll
fraud and usage statistics. E.g. the german telekoms payphone log the time
of a call and the serial number of the prepaid card. (And the only one
reading their publications (and complaining) is the CCC, which has not
quite the right reputation to raise the newspapers attention)

After a few weeks, you tune into the evening news, and after the weather

i've heard this of Petersburg in GUSland.
(do they have freephone numbers there ?)

sorry to correct you, but the 900 MHz licensefree radios, the cellular
radios (analog and digital) and Modacom and Mobitex are all different
i don't want to go into details though, because it doesn't change your main
point, the ability to localize one of these radios while transmitting.
