One design aspect seems missing from the high-level discussion: how do you define the security mechanism failure mode? You have basically two  options: connect with an insecure protocol, or do not connect at all.
If it's a life-preserving application, this question should be addressed  explicitly. A "fail safe" system may be either way, but stakeholders  should know which way. Airplane pilots are trained according to the  failure mode of each aircraft subsystem. E.g. if two-way radio fails, the pilot may remain confident (from an indication on the cockpit) that the air traffic controller (ATC) still sees the aircraft identifier on the radar (see Wikipedia entry for transponder) during the emergency landing. Thus the decision to land at the major airport (instead of a secondary airport with less traffic in conflict but lower grade facilities) is taken based on the "fail-safe" property of the aircraft-to-ATC communications subsystem.
