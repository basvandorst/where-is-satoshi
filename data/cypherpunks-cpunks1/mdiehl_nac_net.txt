Perhaps we should point out to the media (and everyone else who has his ears connected to his brain) that the implementation of GAK will make the Cyber Terrorism scenario _inevitable_ not just possible.
After all, if the government's thesis is that the entire commercial infrastructure could be cracked by hackers, they should readily accept, as a fact, that GAK makes the info terrorist's job easier.  Those terrorists would simply subvert the access mechanisms to GAK
and gain access to _everyone's_ keys.
