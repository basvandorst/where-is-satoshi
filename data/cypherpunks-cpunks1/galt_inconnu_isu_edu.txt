Persuading the audience that you're really not a fucking moron?  Go find
someone else to help you with your homework.

What does this look like, homework "R" us?!  Please enlighten us as to
which university you are going to, so we can forward your mail to the
English department: it sounds like they could use a good
housecleaning.  As for seatbelts: I would suggest that you never use one
yourself--perhaps we can all be so lucky as to see you dead on the side of
the road.  Perhaps we could even hold a cotillion on your grave.

Most LEOs are among their most supportive members.  They troll
mailinglists for membership and often supplement their income by blowing
little boys for lunch money....

More importantly, 8M deep water isn't HP by any means.  That only works
out to 2 atm, engineering definitions of high pressure mean 500+ psi (1
atm is 15 psi).  Basically, cast aluminum or brass could do the trick.

Cypherpunks is archived?  Isn't that against what most cypherpunks stand
for?  I know it sets up a "style fingerprint" attack against anonymity...

That was not rude.  This is rude: it is my fervent wish that someone as
stupid as yourself under no circumstances breed.  To be more exact, it is
my wish that you never become a "fucker" so to speak.  Since you can't
look in a goddamn Loompanics catalog to get the Anarchist's Cookbook, you
have no hope of ever understanding it, and it would be even MORE rude of
me to actually give you a copy, since a good portion of the recipies
contained therein are almost certain to cause death or grave bodily
injury if followed as written.  I really cannot see the down side in this,
but I also do not wish to have your moronic blood on my hands, even by
proxy, as I fear that idiocy such as yours might have some infectious
element.  I have included cypherpunks in this thread again, as I'm pretty
sure that your idiocy should propagate on the off chance that somebody
actually wanted to send a copy of the AC to you.

This was the list I used on "jam echelon day".  It is by no means
complete, but it's a start.  The system is echelon, and it's used by the
NSA outside the US and by extension by the FBI within the US.  Echelon is
only a rumor, but some LEA's have been caught saying in public that
echelon is "old news" when asked about it.

It works this time!  Okay, I'll bite, what's down?  The last two times you
posted this link, it coincided with a servic dying.  First, it was mail,
then it was httpd.  So what is it this time?

See what happens when you send chain letters?  I'm really trying to work
up some sympathy here, but I'm just failing.  You participated in an
illegal chain letter and now you want to be protected from the
consequences of your actions.  Tough.
HTH, HAND, FOAD, etc.
