@_subject: [mises] praxeology and game theory 
Today, in Managerial Economics, the professor talked about Game
Theory. The subject made me hark back to "Austrian Economics and Game
Theory: a Stocktaking" at  I also thought of
*The Games Economists Play*, by Murphy, at  I see some interesting elements of value in game theory.
Fundamentally, it appears to be strongly influenced by praxeology,
human action, as is indicated in the basic Prisoner's Dilemna.
Furthermore, though Murphy notes that game theory has been used to
justify state intervention (because the Nash-equilibrium is not the
optimum cooperation), there are also those who have used game theory
to argue against State intervention. See *The Possibility of
Cooperation* by Michael Taylor. Anyways, a cruel alternative to prisoner's dilemna occured to me in
the class. This was not really my own creation, but I remembered it
from Baldur's Gate II.
* If both push their buttons, both die.
* If neither push their buttons, both die.
* If one of them pushes their button, but the other doesn't, the one
who did not push the button dies.
* Each of them has one hour to decide whether or not to push the button
* Neither of them can see whether the other is about to or has pushed
his or her button
Obviously, this is a one-shot "game", so we need not considder
repeated games. The following outcome table emerges (in each cell, the
first listed outcome is what happens to A, the second listed one is
what happens to B, given the inputs, which are the row and column headers:
                             A
  ------------
The Game Theorist Analysis
It seems to me that game theorists -- not game theory itself -- have
some problems from the start. Namely, they go beyond economics and
into psychology, making assumptions which can hardly be assumed to be
univeral. The game theorist would assume that A would want the L,D
outcome and B would want the D,L outcome. However, why does that need
to be so?
Let's consider one possible preference which everyone seems to reject
off-hand: D,D. Let's say that A and B were married. It is possible to
think that both, then, would place the highest value on outcome D,D,
as both know that neither would want to live without the other. Once we accept that the fact that it is possible that A and B may have
any of the listed 13 value scales, the normal game theory analysis is
completely exploded, and this seemingly "simple" example becomes
unbelievably complex. Sponsor: Yahoo! Groups Links
