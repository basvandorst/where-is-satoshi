Is there any indication that the things that Jim said to Declan weren't meant for publication? Your outrage would seem reasonable if Jim and Declan were friends, and Declan had published things told to him apparently in confidence - but he's a reporter, and that's why Jim talked to him. Jim likes publicity and attention. Jim wanted to see his name and his ideas and his allegations about the federal government in Wired, or on the Wired website. Jim got what he wanted. I doubt he's angry. Have you asked him Because he's got a big sign on his hat saying "CANARY", and because people who talk to him (or post their ideas publicly) are looking for widespread Cypherpunks isn't about "tolerating" people, it's a collection of mailing lists which some people use to discuss politics, technology, and privacy. Just as it's not possible to exclude you, the feds, or any of the annoying Jims, it's not possible to exclude Declan even if that seemed like a good idea.  But that would be counterproductive - cypherpunks isn't a list for hatching great conspiracies, where secrecy is important or expected. It is a list for identifying and sharpening good ideas, and a variety of participants is helpful towards that goal.
People who expect privacy vis-a-vis grand jury or trial subpoenas need to learn to speak only to people or in environments which are privileged against subpoena and monitoring. Or, don't expect privacy, and don't say anything which would be damaging if it were repeated in court. It's not nearly good enough to avoid people who consider themselves likely to be defendants in criminal cases - anybody can end up as a witness, or as a party to a civil case.

According to the article at , the International Chamber of Commerce's Commercial Crime Bureau and Cybercrime Unit - which apparently "polices all financial and intellectual property rights breaches on the Internet" - has identified "the problem with the Internet", specifically -
"The problem with the Net is that it is not secure because Internet service providers don't run identity checks on their clients . . . [i]t is very easy to set up an email account and web page on an ISP offering free web space and no checks are done on the people setting them up."
That's funny. I was just thinking that the problem with the Internet is that it gives every control freak with a tinfoil badge and an AOL account the idea that they ought to "police" people and things they've never seen or heard of.

This is a common refrain - especially among people who are pushing, for cultural or economic reasons, the adoption of a PKI system - but I think it suffers considerably from being overgeneralized.
Specifically, it's common to overemphasize the importance of the government-based legal system as a dispute resolution system, or as a righter of wrongs, especially private civil contract-based litigation where force multipliers like attorneys' fees awards, punitive damages, or widespread public scorn or embarrassment.
Even in a case where nothing goes wrong - e.g., both parties are subject to personal jurisdiction in the same place, they agree on the laws to be applied and the court which should apply them, and they have a clear pre-existing agreement covering their relationship - litigation is slow and expensive. On TV, it looks like a dramatic clash between two lone samurai attorneys fighting for the honor of their principals. In the real world, it looks more like WW I trench warfare, with expensive, slow, vicious, impersonal fighting over feet and yards of muddy, uninteresting terrain that's not good for much once the fighting stops.
One of the problems people have when they learn defensive shooting is that they expect criminal assailants to just fall down and die if they're shot once, because that's how it works in the movies. In real life, actual criminals have often been shot before - frequently several times - and lived without serious consequences, partly because they received prompt, skilled medical care, and partly because the people who shot them didn't select an effective combination of ammunition and firearm. Because of their experience with gunshot wounds, criminals no longer necessarily have a great fear of being shot, nor are they likely to respond to it as a life-threatening event. Consequently, a person defending themselves against people like that will need to use force sufficient to render them physically and medically incapable of attack - injuries which might otherwise have resulted in moral or emotional incapacitation are likely to be inadequate to end an attack.
Turns out the same thing happens with people and companies who use lawsuits instead of guns - they learn that it's not the end of the world if you get sued, and that suing someone (especially if they're an experienced defendant) isn't necessarily going to make them play nicely immediately.
We talk about people making decisions based on the abstract notion of "the law" or "the courts" - but it's more useful to break that down further into decisions based upon "the carrot" and "the stick", or "greed" and "fear" .. the labels aren't important, so much as is thinking about those two flavors of human motivation. The "legally enforceable contract" notion is meant to invoke fear of a powerful and unavoidable stick - ideally striking fear (and good behavior) into the heart of a potential bad actor. As things turn out, sophisticated actors - be they businesspersons, criminals, diplomats, or whomever - come to understand that the law's force as a stick is not so powerful and unlimited as it's frequently portrayed.
Does the failure of "the stick" doom us to lives of fear and hunger? No. Not at all - in fact, many of the people who enjoy themselves the most seem to be people who have learned to act on "carrot" motives, and to structure their negotiations and contracts with others so that they are operating not based upon fear, but upon mutual advancement and cooperation?
No - it depends on maintaining a consistent identity, whose trades with its counterparties are considered by those counterparties to be both predictable and beneficial.
As Tim May writes in a message which arrived while I was composing this one, there are plenty of examples of reputations as the basis for business deals now - and business deals which occur despite the lack of reputation systems. Cross-jurisdictional trade is one - really, it's just an example of the general class of disputes where the cost of resolving the dispute exceeds the value in dispute. There's a vast amount of commerce which goes on - certainly the majority in terms of number of transactions, likely the majority in terms of transaction dollar value, as well - where the cost to the participants to adjudicate a dispute regarding the transaction is greater than the value of the underlying goods, but is perceived as smaller than the cost to either party of ending their relationship.
Easy examples of transactions without legal enforcement or reputation are street-level illegal transactions - e.g., purchases of drugs, sex, or forbidden information. At least initially, neither buyer nor seller knows if their counterparty is trustworthy -  but these transactions take place, because both participants think that the value they get from the exchange is valuable .. in fact, more valuable than the risk that their counterparty is going to swindle them, or turn out to be an undercover cop. Even higher-level or repeat transactions, where participants have some level of experience with one another, present each with an opportunity to injure the other while denying the other access to traditional legal means of redressing that wrong.
More examples about in the import-export arena - there are a number of private transaction patterns which have evolved to minimize risk and misunderstanding, but participants in international trade understand that there's some risk that they'll spend money to purchase unusable/unsalable product, or that they'll manufacture or reserve a specific quantity of goods for a buyer who may never appear .. and people doing business in those lines find that, most of the time, most people would rather conclude a deal well in hopes of gaining further business, either from that customer or via referrals.
It is true that there is a vast amount of almost-demand on the parts of risk-averse people who don't want to act for fear of being wrong - but there are a lot of people who have figured out how to get things done without depending on "the stick" that is the law, and are doing so already. It is the latter group of people whose needs must be met for a transjurisdictional commerce system to be successful - the former group can come along when they're ready, or not at all.

@_subject: Reading List (for the umpteenth time....) 
This is why it's unlikely that identities will ever have objective "reputation capital" numbers - different people have different information about the identity, and interpret it differently. However, it's possible to sharpen these fuzzy, relative perspectives by restating them as insurance (or bets, or positions, or guaranties, depending on your moral and regulatory perspective) on the subject of the ratings.
Even in the current credit report market, most merchants don't want to deal with the fine details of a person's full credit report, with years' worth of data about debts owed .. which is why Fair Isaac and the credit agencies will boil the credit reports down into credit scores, making it easy to sort credit applications into different "accept at rate X" or "accept at rate Y" or "deny" bins.
I suspect that we won't see traditional "credit rating agencies" on the TRW/Equifax model, but risk transfer agencies - who put some assets at risk behind their ratings - e.g., agencies who will take a cut from the profits of a given loan, and who are on the hook as (partial) guarantors of the loan if it's not repaid. This mostly means restating the "credit score" as a "risk factor" - e.g., instead of saying "this person doesn't pay their bills", they'll say "you should get 5% down up front" or "you should get 95% down up front" or "we'd  make an unsecured loan to this entity at an interest rate of X%".
On one hand, this makes privacy "violations" (judged against current ideals) more widespread - on the other hand, it's likely to make identity theft less likely, as the credit guarantor has a stronger motivation to make sure that the party receiving the loan really does match the dossier supplied to rate the risk involved in making the loan.
Getting the credit agencies involved as lenders or guarantors means it's actually good if different agencies rate risk differently - because it means that the transaction can be financed at the lowest available rate, where that rate reflects either especially good or especially poor information and analysis, with the expected effects on the survival of the agency. Credit agencies which include bad (because it was never correct, or because it is obsolete) credit data will end up mispricing the risk involved, which means they'll end up with no business (because they rated risk too high, charged too much interest, and made few/no loans) or too much business.

Yes, the laws can be written, and they will enjoy the same efficiency and success that laws against copyright violation, pornography, prostitution, illicit drugs, and so forth have experienced. Not only can the law not touch an anonymous economy, it cannot prevent one, either.
It's difficult for people in comfortable democratic countries to fully comprehend that activities like drug trafficking, pornography distribution, and adultery continue in places where punishment for those activities is likely to be summary public execution. Further tinkering with the Sentencing Guidelines, for example, might change the rate at which those things occur, but it will not eliminate them. At a macro policy level, we cannot choose a regulatory configuration where those activities never occur - humans have already experimented with incredibly scary sticks (like death and torture and extended unpleasant imprisonment) and found them inadequate to eliminate them. We will have to plan (to the extent that macro planning is considered important) on those activities continuing; and we should not abandon otherwise productive choices because they fail to achieve the Greg Broiles

You're still thinking like a nice middle-class person with a normal job. People who are serious about participating in black markets use human and technological cutouts to do their business, as well as good old-fashioned graft and corruption. In some criminal cultures, prison time is a badge of honor. In many criminal cultures, it's low-level disposable people who commit the actual crimes - it's the John Gottis and the Pablo Escobars and the Dick Nixons back sleeping in their beds who profit from it.
If it was easy to stop crime by passing laws, we'd have done it already.
Consider Jim Bell in light of your objections above - do you consider him "controlled"? If so, then the control you speak of is hardly sufficient to prevent forbidden activity. If not, then what makes you think that other, more clueful people can be controlled?

I think this is the really interesting leap here - from the ability of a court to order production of documents, to the ability of a court to control distribution of information. The "production" or subpoena aspect has been hashed and rehashed ad nauseam on the list - but the reporter's attorney said they were asking for all originals and copies of the reporter's notes, which makes it sound like this grand jury (or the prosecutor controlling it) would like to swallow them up and never give them back - or delay public knowledge and discussion of the events involved in the case until a time more convenient for prosecutors and law enforcement.
I think a response more appropriate than secrecy (with the attending arguments about offshore trusts, the relationship between crosscut shredders and cryptography, etc) would have been immediate, widespread publication - via Freenet or Cryptome, if the local paper wasn't interested. Then there's no more arguing over secret documents, and the grand jury's free to read about it in the newspaper and ask the journalist to come in and confirm that no details were altered during the editing Courts have relatively strong powers with respect to controlling the possession and disposition of physical things like notebooks or hard disks, but relatively weak powers with respect to limiting the dissemination of information not in the court's exclusive possession, so long as the disseminator is not a party to a case before the court, nor an attorney for a party.
So don't fight the court where they're strong and you're weak - fight where you're strong and the court is weak, e.g., about prior restraint of publishing, rather than whether or not evidence was destroyed or withheld, which might be a contempt proceeding, which includes very little "due process" and no jury.
The other lesson to be learned is that Texas courts don't recognize a journalistic privilege - so Texas journalists shouldn't expect to benefit from one. Also, that the protections afforded publishers in 42 USC 2000aa won't necessarily extend to abusive grand juries, since they likely don't fall within the definition of "government officers and employees", even if they're just a cat's paw for the prosecutor.
I think a lot of the tension around "cypherpunks should think about law" or "cypherpunks should not waste time on law" comes from different basic assumptions - if you start out thinking that police are thugs and you have no rights except the ones you enforce yourself, then all of this legal discussion is a big distraction. If you start out thinking that you live in the high-school-civics-class version of America, and that the Bill of Rights and the 14th Amendment are alive and well on the streets and in the courtrooms, then, the legal discussion is relevant to the extent that it brings those expectations back in line with reality.
Of course, sometimes people with the first view will admit that the thugs' behavior isn't totally arbitrary, but needs to be mostly orderly and appear reasonable so as to preserve the thugs' privileged position, and that it's possible to take advantage of that systemic tendency towards predictability to game the system, and thereby avoid the thugs - and sometimes people with the second view will admit that perhaps the delta between the advertised version of Reality and the implementation is so vast that it's easier to list the positive changes from the "thug" model than the negatives changes from the Jeffersonian/Madisonian ideal.

The Sopranos gets it right - the process is called "minimization", and is intended to limit the evidence collected to only that which discloses criminal activity - there are strict rules about how a conversation can be sampled, as the show portrayed.
But the agents don't need to follow the rules if they don't intend to ever use the proceeds of the tap in court, or disclose its existence.
Yes. There is a time limit for when they should be disclosed if they don't lead to a prosecution - that time limit can be extended by a judge, if the agents think they need more time to develop a case. I don't believe the (federal) law allows for taps to go undisclosed forever, but I believe it happens anyway. Since the undisclosed taps aren't likely to be the focus of litigation, there's no effective check on that practice.

That was my first reaction to those comments.
I think what they're talking about is the process of "technology transfer", whereby people are paid by the government to develop new technology, then quit their low-risk low-pay government jobs for private sector jobs commercializing the technology they developed earlier, selling implemented, commercial (or mil-spec) versions back to the government. (One variation of this has the developers handing off the technology to old college friends or agency predecessors, who are generous enough to grant them stock options in the private company). It's much easier to commercialize the technology if it's boiled down to one or more forms of traditional intellectual property, like patents - it was only attractive to invest in open-souce companies for a year or so, and that was a few years ago. If you hurry, you can still buy some Red Hat stock before it gets delisted, which has got some old cypherpunk C2Net and Cygnus DNA in it somewhere.
If they want to make the technology widely understood and used, that's easy - write up a nice paper for Crypto or FC or one of the ACM or IEEE journals, with a corresponding project on Sourceforge. It's not like federally developed works even need a license - they're not properly the subject of copyright.
On the other hand, if they want to make big piles of money selling that technology back to the taxpayers who funded its development, locking it up for 20 years isn't such a silly choice.
This strategy is an especially nice one for privacy technologies like remailers - there's no good consumer market for them, but governments and other big actors have a strong need to hide their actions from public scrutiny from time to time, because they've got a lot more to lose by getting caught. So it's a neat little commercial backwater where it ought to be possible to charge a few customers a lot of money for technology they can't buy anywhere else because (a) it's not widely understood or available, and (b) the vendor has an exclusive patent license, and can eliminate competitors. (free software isn't a competitor, because anonymizing is a service, not a product or a computer program, so it doesn't matter if there are infringing cypherpunk versions.)

Yeah. People thinking about law school should spend some time talking with currently practicing (or non-practicing) attorneys and validate their assumptions and expectations before investing years of their lives and tens of thousands of dollars. The practice of law isn't what it looks like from the movies and TV - mostly what people don't understand is that the practice of law is a business, and it's a service business, where revenue is directly linked to hours of human effort applied to market demand. If the demand's not there, or the human effort's not there, there's no revenue - nor if the clients can't pay. Attorneys who make a lot of money do so only by leveraging the efforts of junior attorneys and support staff, just like any other service business, and consequently spend a significant amount of time managaing and marketing instead of lawyering.
None of the prominent Cypherpunk trials have featured defendants with the budget to hire defense counsel, nor the inclination to turn over strategic or tactical decisions to their attorneys. Those trials weren't opportunities to make lots of money, or show off one's learned skills - they were tar pits of malpractice and resentment.
(That doesn't mean the prosecutions or convictions were necessarily reasonable, nor that the defendants deserved what happened to them, but they weren't situations where some Legal Lone Ranger was needed to ride onto the scene and save the day.)
Even the current prosecution of Dmitri Sklyarov is being handled in a non-cypherpunk way (and that's good for him) - e.g., no full-court-press on Constitutional grounds, his attorney is talking quietly with his colleagues in the US Attorney's office, likely to positive results for Sklyarov. Firebreathing, Stallman-quoting Disney-DMCA-Adobe-hating activist-lawyers wouldn't make things better here.
People who want to make money or privacy should look to technology long before they look to law - law is slow, conservative, and full of fussy rules. Just write code.
I find that Oliver Wendell Holmes' commentary "The Path of the Law", written in 1897, is still incredibly insightful and on-topic regarding the relationship between law, morality, and the utility of a legal education, especially as discussed on the list.

I don't think the answers are obvious or unchanging - but the answers to questions like that about meatspace things related to (relatively) unchanging media or technology aren't obvious or unchanging, either. Really, there aren't a lot of hard-and-fast "answers", because every question's got two sides, and there's always someone who wants things to work differently, because the status quo hurts them and the difference would help them.
I don't think the jurisdictional questions are especially different from those raised by postal mail, printed publications, telephones, or fax machines - the big difference I see is one of quantity, not quality, because communicating over great distances in a machine-comprehensible format (well, sort of) allows machines to speed up and automate the communicating process, allowing smaller organizations to piss off more people in more diverse jurisdictions more quickly.
But the basic questions about the appropriateness of a court in one place exercising power over people or property some distance away haven't changed at all - and unless there's something really different about one form of communications, I don't see any reason to treat it differently from the rest.
Many of the questions currently in the news - including the Napster/copyright and jurisdictional/regulatory arbitrage approaches - were in the news 200 years ago. (See, for example, "Dickens's 1842 Reading Tour: Launching the Copyright Question in Tempestuous Seas" at  for a discussion of 200 years' worth of offshore piracy)
As Tim mentioned, they're not really priced for people who are self-educating - the dollar/learning ratio would be a lot better with basic books & periodicals, and the time would be as profitably (or more profitably) spent at low-cost or no-cost events like Cypherpunks meetings, BAWUG meetings, the Mac Crypto conference, and other efforts more focused on peer-to-peer interaction. I have found those high-ticket events to be valuable when I was able to immediately use the information gained in my work - either because the people speaking had a perspective unavailable to me (like one seminar I went to which featured a bunch of people from the Dept of Commmerce/BXA explaining how they interpreted crypto export control regs), or because they saved me many hours of work collecting and interpreting voluminous information into outline/presentation format. But I don't bother with those sorts of things unless I can see how they'll pay for themselves within 60 days or so, either by speeding up existing work or letting me start new projects previously unavailable.

What's the reason?
If the goal was disassembly and analysis, it wouldn't be necessary to buy more than one copy - and even buying one copy is mostly a formality, though it's probably a lot cheaper and faster than any of the other ways people might get it. Still, it wouldn't exactly be a big problem for them to buy a single copy (or a few copies) with more-or-less untraceable addresses and credit cards. If they disclosed their identity, they already had what they needed, or were sure they could get it one way or another.
The beta was available - I've forgotten the exact timing, by now - to anybody with a credit card and an Internet connection, and CD-ROM copies of the beta were handed out at web/internet-oriented conferences.
ZKS was not (nor is anyone else with distribution on any interesting scale) faced with the choice "Shall I let the various three-letter-agencies have a copy of my software?". ZKS was faced with the choice "Would we like to get a lot, a little, or no money from the NSA?", and it's hard to blame them for taking the cash. Further, they've been open (since late 1999/early 2000, at least) about wanting to encourage and facilitate law enforcement and intelligence community use of their system, so that those groups come to see ZKS/Freedom as a system which has good and bad aspects, instead of just bad ones .. in hopes that a more nuanced (or conflicted) view of Freedom's utility would slow down or stop regulatory activity aimed at ZKS.
Well, no, it's not especially elegant or poetic, but it's simple economics, which are at the heart of both successful business and successful cryptography. If ZKS refused to sell to NSA, what would have changed, except for their ability to crow "We told NSA to fuck off!" ..?
"Dissident-grade untraceability" (DGU) is an elusive goal - if you look at what's theoretically possible, we've got it now (and have had it for ~ 20 years, albeit with an unfriendly UI). If you look at what's deployed, we'll probably never get there, because it's a multi-layered problem, where holes appear in layers far beyond the control of any individual or organization.
Maybe ZKS can give me really great privacy within the 7-layer stack, but they can't do anything about someone torturing me until I confess to crimes I did (or didn't) commit, or undercover agents who pretend to be fellow dissidents but are actually secret policemen, or snoopy busybodies who notice that every time I use the computer at the local cybercafe, a few hours later a new issue of The Squealing Rodent hits Usenet full of irresponsible rumors about the Administration .. or that during the months I was on "vacation" in solitary confinement, no new issues were published.
DGU is just like other kinds of security - it's not a product or service you can buy from someone, even if you're really careful to pick the right vendor. Maybe you can pick a vendor who does a good job within their area of responsibility - and maybe you can pick a vendor who'll tell you really clearly which problems they solve and which problems they don't - but it's silly to expect anyone (be it ZKS or SafeWeb or anonymous remailers or anyone else) to provide perfect untraceability on a silver platter, such that users don't need to pay any attention themselves. You'll never get real-world perfect untraceability if you've got human beings at the ends of the "anonymous" communication pipes.

When you talk about "collaborating" and ZKS selling beta software to the NSA, are you saying you've got information that ZKS gave the NSA access to more information than the general public got, and/or that the NSA got their access or information meaningfully earlier than the general public?
If that's the case, that's interesting, but that's too serious a claim to let pass by as an unstated implication.
If that's not the case - and they had the same access to the Freedom beta code that the rest of us outsiders/Cypherpunks/critics/commentators did - then I don't see an issue here.

I've had pretty good luck, when dealing with private and some governmental organizations, with the following -
"I don't give out my SSN for privacy reasons."
sometimes adding, "Could you assign me a new number to use within your organization?" or "I have a nine digit number I use instead of an SSN, can I use that instead?"
In particular, the latter is helpful where the person I'm talking to doesn't personally care what they enter, but the computer system or local policy is that a nine-digit number MUST be entered (or used as a database key), and they're not allowed to just make up numbers themselves. We can complete the transaction - I haven't lied nor committed fraud, they're not in trouble with their boss, and everyone's happy.
There's no particular reason the nine-digit number you supply needs to be the same when you deal with different organizations, so you're limiting their ability to cross-link databases using that field. If they've got full name, date of birth, and address, they probably don't need an SSN to cross-link, it just saves some programmer and computer time.
Kaiser assigns an internal "member number" which isn't your SSN for use within their system - but that's no reason to give them the SSN in the first place.

No, no, this is a copyright problem in Choate Prime - when people walk in front of heat sources, they make shadow animals on the walls (and on the thermal imagers), and that violates their copyright, unless the cops got prior permission to look at and record the shadow animals. (Well, really only if the people make a big (C) shadow animal first.)
Also, this is a First Amendment problem, because the cops have a right to free speech in court when they describe the shadow animals they saw with their thermal imagers.
Since it's possible to get statutory damages for copyright infringement, in Choate Prime the cops are entitled to court-appointed attorneys to protect their free speech rights. Unless they're mimes.

I'm assembling a collection of known attacks on anonymity systems, and went to Zero Knowledge's website to look at their materials, and noticed a few changes that might be of interest to people following the anonymity business -
They recently released Freedom 2.2. Their product/service offering now seems to be split into two categories - one "standard service" and one "premium service", where the "premium service" apparently uses crypto (and nesting? hard to tell from the marketing stuff) to provide stronger anonymity, while the standard doesn't, sounding more like a cross between the Anonymizer and Norton Internet Security (at a lower price).
With the release of 2.2, Linux and Macintosh versions are no longer supported due to lack of demand.
Adam Back, Ian Goldberg, and Adam Shostack put together a really helpful paper ("Freedom 2.1 Security Issues and Analysis") describing known difficulties and holes in their system. It's worth reading and thinking about even if you're not using Freedom, because most of the issues are present for ordinary web users, or users of other privacy-protecting systems. ZKS' willingness and ability to release this sort of information about their product and their field indicates that they've still got people of integrity working there, which is really good to see. The paper is beneath the "white papers" link - they've moved to a dynamic page-generating system which makes me reluctant to post a long (and probably short-lived) URL, but it's not hard to find.

That wasn't "someone hidden with a video camera", it was a video recording unit in the cop car - and the audio was probably wireless mike(s) going back to that same recorder - it's frequently used for traffic or DUI stops, to record evidence against the accused. The "VSP" in the lower left corner is most likely Virginia State Police, the agency whose officers were involved in the interaction.
The video probably got to the website via the defendant, who received it through the pretrial discovery process.

Yes, she does - but the recorder would either have been on her person (in which case it would have been taken from her before she was sitting in the back of the police car), or in her car.
In either case, it wouldn't have been in a good position to get a nice clear audio recording of the final part where the two cops stand on the roadside and talk about whether or not they can seize her reading material as evidence on the obstructing justice charge.
The only way you're going to get nice clear audio like that is if the cop has a lapel mike with a wireless transmitter, and they're pretty common among cops now, especially among highway patrol/state troopers, who make a lot of traffic stops and DUI stops (where they can usually control positioning of their car/camera vis-a-vis the suspect and their car), which are ripe for automated evidence recording from a dash-mounted video camera + short-range radio transmitter/mike combination. City cops spend more of their time farther away from their cars, in buildings, etc - so city police departments usually put A/V equipment in  special DUI task force cars instead of in every car.
It's also not uncommon for cops who want their own recording, or for less well-funded departments, to use an old-fashioned microcassette recorder on the cop's duty belt or in a chest pocket where the built-in mic can get pretty good audio.
I'm very confident that the video is from the trooper's own car - because of the positioning, because of the "VSP", because you can see the push bar on the cop car's front bumper at the bottom of the frame, and because I'm really skeptical that someone else with a video camera would be able to get close enough to get that shot without being run off by the cops, unless they used a strong zoom lens, which are hard to keep stable - even on a tripod - unless you've got really nice + heavy equipment. Besides, assuming that's true, where's the cop car? We can tell it's behind the woman's car, because you can see its flashing lights reflected on the troopers' uniforms and on the street signs - so it's near the camera. If the car is in between the camera and the woman's car, why didn't we see it or its lights? Or if the camera is in between the cop car and the woman's car, why didn't the cops see the camera during the encounter .. especially given that the camera's not on the ground hidden in (apparently) a scrap of roadside trash, or else we'd see a really different perspective.
Ok, maybe someone set up thousands of dollars of nice video equipment in a duck blind or something and then hid across the street with a parabolic mike to get the audio .. because they knew this was going to happen?
Occam's Razor says this recording was made by the cops.
Not that the identity of the party making the recording diminishes the constitutional issues here about unreasonable search & seizure, right to remain silent, right to freely read & associate & travel, etc., under both the US and VA constitutions.
On the other hand, if you're driving you can be asked to produce a drivers' license, and cops can ask you to identify yourself if you're out in public - but they must accept your oral self-report regarding your identity, and can't arrest you for not carrying "your papers", unless you're in a class of persons who must carry their papers, like some non-citizens and people who are driving. If this was meant to be some sort of test case or demonstration of police misconduct, it gets off to a bad start that way - I don't know if everything that followed is justifiable under VA law, but they weren't out of line (in a non-Choate universe, anyway) asking for her drivers' license if they saw her driving that car. I didn't see anything that looked to me like obstructing an officer or assaulting an officer.

The US Supreme Court last addressed this in November 2000 - their conclusion is that checkpoints may be legal if they're done for a permissible reason. The federal government may conduct checkpoints to identify illegal aliens near border crossings; and states and cities may conduct checkpoints to detect drunk drivers or license/equipment violations if the checkpoints are intended to ensure highway safety. Checkpoints are not permitted if they were operated, as they were in _City of Indianapolis v. Edmond_ , for a general law enforcement purpose.
So, if you're a police department, don't set up any of those "drug dealer" checkpoints, because they're not OK - but if you see a lot of drug dealers in a particular neighborhood, you can go ahead and set up a drivers' license/registration/proof-of-insurance/taillight *safety* checkpoint in that neighborhood, and if you happen to run across any evidence of drug possession or use or sale while you're conducting a safety checkpoint, well, so be it . . .
Also take a look at , though they don't have the _Edmond_ case on their site yet, so perhaps they're not wildly up-to-date.
State constitutional provisions may provide greater privacy protection - California's doesn't, Oregon's does (though not necessarily in a car stop/checkpoint context), I've got no idea what Virginia's constitution says or how it's interpreted. I mention this law-geek point only as a reminder that there are frequently two constitutions regulating government behavior, and it's very common (even among lawyers) to forget about the state constitution. State constitutions are also a wonderful way for state courts to disagree with the US Supreme Court without getting overruled, at least in the direction of limiting government actors - they merely need to interpret their own state's constitution to be more protective of individual rights, where the US Supreme Court and the US Constitution represent a baseline or "floor" for protection, not the "ceiling". Oregon courts have done this with respect to search and seizure and have developed their own body of more sensible search and seizure jurisprudence which avoids the result-oriented federal trainwreck. California was doing this, too, but that got chopped off at the knees by a bunch of Republicans a few years ago and now CA's constitution is interpreted mostly as an identical copy of the US constitution, on criminal law topics.
Be careful here, with your state's surveillance/wiretap/recording rules, with respect to being in a 1-party state or a 2-party state - I've heard that CA cops can be very aggressive re prosecution versus citizens who make audio recordings of them without consent.
I have wondered about this but don't have answers. One direction of thought and research which might be productive is nondestructively temporarily disabling the camera, perhaps by flooding its light sensor with a focused beam of light, like a flashlight or laser - it's going to compensate for that level of lighting, leaving the rest of the frame underexposed, as long as it's misled by that local brightness.
Also, if you're monkeying with cop cameras, that *would* probably be obstruction of justice or interfering with a police officer or whatever your local "don't fuck with the cops" statute is.

I'm not sure what you mean when you put person in quotes like that.
Yes, there have been some successful criminal cases against copyright infringers - the legislation of particular interest was called the "No Electronic Theft Act" (UCITA is mostly concerned with licensing details, not piracy per se).
A self-congratulatory press release from the US DOJ after the first NETA prosecution in 1999 can be found at ; there have been other arrests, which, like most federal prosecutions (and, indeed, most prosecutions) were resolved with guilty pleas, not trials, so there weren't exciting Slashdot stories to read.
Yes. See
for examples if you're talking about professional pirates - if what you mean is "Will I get arrested if I install the same copy of Microsoft Office on 3 or 4 computers?" the answer is "No", but if those 3 or 4 computers are at a workplace, and employees learn of the copying and are later laid off or fired or otherwise become disgruntled, there's a modest chance that they'll exact some revenge by reporting the company to the SPA/BSA, who send grouchy letters and threaten audits, and actually do them once in awhile, which tend to be embarassing and disruptive and expensive.

Well, I don't know what's the CDC's concerns are, but nasal swabs seem likely to answer one question - "does this person presently have anthrax spores inside their nasal passage?" which is different in several important ways from other questions of interest, including -
Has this person been exposed to anthrax bacteria or spores in the last 60 - 90 days?
Has this person's immune system created antibodies to the anthrax bacteria?
Have this person's lymph nodes become infected? Are toxins being produced?
Some people may have anthrax spores in their nose but no infection (perhaps they were exposed to far fewer than the 5-10000 spores needed for inhalational anthrax) and some people may have an infection but no spores in their nose (because they have cutaneous anthrax, or because they blew their nose a lot, or because they're frequent users of powderered inhaled drugs like cocaine or amphetamine and don't have hair inside their noses).
So - if the purpose of the test is to determine which people need medical treatment - the test is likely to be misleading, sometimes optimistically, sometimes pessimistically.

I get the impression this isn't exactly "mirroring" static content, but participating in a distributed publishing/retrieval system, a la Freenet and Mojo Nation or BitTorrent .. or maybe more like Gnutella or Kazaa .. or even Publius, which was nice but never seemed to catch on.

What software are you using? Is it well-known? Debugged? Is the source available? (well, it's Perl, I guess..)
I don't mind mirroring Cryptome, but I'm pretty wary of installing other people's newly-hacked-up code in a [quasi-]production environment .. your proposal creates two kinds of risk. The first, which is relatively familiar by now, is content risk, from people angry about the content .. the second is the risk of security problems in the code or its configuration/installation, and that sounds like a bigger issue to me.
Why not just use one of the existing distributed systems for this content? If you put content in the Gnutella or Kazaa systems, you can give us filenames or search strings and then we just make locally cached copies and leave machines running (even crappy little windows boxes) to create dispersed hard-to-clobber-them-all content. If you put it in the Mojo/Freenet/BitTorrent systems, and make the URLs of the content publically available, helpful people can make local copies of all or parts of your files pretty easily, too.
Or, alternately, make just content available as a .zip or .tgz, and let others serve it using FTP/HTTP servers they're already familiar with.

Well, no. "Martial law" usually implies that civil authorities have been replaced or overriden by military command, and that civilian law is not in effect, having been replaced by orders from a military command structure; and it's usually imposed on formerly hostile territory, or territories considered very close to conflict spatially or temporally.
That has not happened in the US, except arguably at the ground zero site, and even there it sounds like it's civilian police officers and elected officials, not military officers, who are setting policy.

If Pravda had written "police state", I wouldn't disagree. Perhaps something was lost in the translation.
I'm surprised that Guiliani's early proposal that elections be postponed and that he remain in charge of NYC for some indeterminate period of time hasn't aroused more anger - or his abandoned suggestion that the term limit rules he backed be modified or eliminated to allow him to stay in power - or his use of the fear of terrorism to enact (by fiat, apparently) other rules he thinks generally beneficial, e.g., special benefits for carpoolers and special restrictions on single-occupant private motor vehicles. That doesn't have shit to do with security, but lots to do with taking advantage of the chaos and flux to implement his own vision of society unhindered by anything as old-school as voting or written laws.

Indeed. Actually, in the third quarter of 2001, Oracle made 67% of its revenues from consulting and services, and only 33% of its revenue from licensing, according to their 10-Q SEC filing. (The split was 64/36 for service/licensing in Q3 2000).
As the Mercury News article says ..
.. so basically he'll give the USG a one-time break on the software purchase, but they'll pay full rate for the consulting to get it up and running, and for maintenance thereafter, which would easily run into the billions of dollars, given the scope of this project, the size of the database, and the uptime/performance requirements a realistic implementation would call for.
What an asshole.
Oracle talked the City of Oakland into adopting Oracle Financials to run the city's books and payroll - the project ran months over deadline (past 1/1/2000, even though it was being installed to fix a Y2K problem with the existing installation), resulted in withholding errors and missed paychecks for city workers, missing reports for budget purposes, and generally created an administrative and accounting nightmare. Deep into the project, the Oracle consultants admitted that they'd promised to do things for Oakland that they'd never done before, that they weren't sure how long it would take to finish, or if the promised functionality would ever be I don't know if they ever finished.
And now they want to do *that* with a National ID database - so the taxpayers get screwed three times - once paying for it, once because it's inaccurate, and once because it's a fucking fascist nightmare.

I didn't see anywhere where Stu Baker said that he thought this was constitutional and/or within the original text of CALEA - the quoted bits I saw had him saying that the FBI is drafting regulations which proceed on the assumption that they can consider ISP's within CALEA's regulatory reach. He talked about the FBI's position, not his position.
I don't think he's likely to take a hard-and-fast stance one way or the other on this; he's way too smart to get hung out to dry with a totally ridiculous position on a black-or-white legal or factual (or political) question. I don't agree with his balancing of security vs. privacy when answering policy questions, but he's also very good at what he does and represents his clients well; a former employer of mine got some help from him which was a godsend at the time, despite what I suspect was his personal opposition (or at least ambivalence) towards our mission.
He's a gun-for-hire, not a doctrinaire blinders-on true believer for either the surveillance enthusiasts or privacy freaks.
If he's talking about the FBI's reading of CALEA so that it reaches ISP's, that may be a good early warning that we're likely to see lots of the Beltway crew agreeing - the question is not whether some random cypherpunk thinks that's a fair reading of CALEA, the question is whether or not a federal judge thinks that's a fair reading, and things like this are valuable clues if you're interested in that narrow question.
CALEA implementation has been slow - if the FBI is drafting regs now, they're going to have to go through the administrative rulemaking process (which I expect they can abbreviate in an "emergency"), publish final regs, and give ISP's at least a short time to comply - so we're still talking about months or years, not hours or days, so it's way too early for tech people to expect to hear about this via work.

Lots of things are "well known" and wrong, too.
I don't know what Kapor has been smoking, but getting focused on Stewart Baker as the enemy is a distraction. He's articulate, and sympathetic to law enforcement/intelligence arguments in favor of surveillance and against privacy, but I'd sure rather hear him make those arguments in public than have him make them in private where the rest of us can't respond or prepare for what's coming.
Maybe Kapor just now noticed that lives really are at stake - crypto and security aren't just about spying on porn downloads and credit cards. His reaction is typical of leftist privacy activists the first time they need to really grapple with violence and its implications - they want to get as far from it as possible, and defer to the right-wing "experts" they previously opposed.
If the FBI really is preparing for a domestic surveillance initiative, hearing about that months in advance is a lot more helpful than yet another incompatible peer-to-peer content distribution system.

We have a special process for deciding who's done fucked up deeds and thus deserving of punishment, and it's called a trial.
After these people have had one, then we can argue about what ought to happen to them. Until then - and/or at least until the evidence against these people has been made public and subjected to scrutiny - we don't know whether these people are Mother Teresa or Satan himself or somewhere in If we're going to start beating and torturing and killing people pretrial (paying special attention to foreigners who may not fully agree with our culture or values), exactly how is the ruling regime in the US different from the ruling regime in Afghanistan? The only aspect left that I can see that's different would be a nominally secular vs religious basis, but I don't trust Ashcroft to respect that for long.
Pretrial detention is not supposed to suck, it's supposed to be minimally burdensome, to the extent that's compatible with making sure people show up for trial, don't commit further crimes, and don't cost an exorbitant amount of staff attention.
(* This isn't meant as a claim that what we had prior to 9/11 in terms of trials, pretrial detention, or any of the other criminal procedure features was what it's advertised to be, or that it was compatible with the Constitution - but I still regard the abandonment of even the pretense of complying with the Constitution as a significant step towards some very serious trouble.)

Rather than a direct ban on remailers, I think a creeping expansion of the DMCA is more likely, and a greater threat. Instead of making remailing a criminal act - where only law enforcement is able to chase violators - it's more effective to change liability rules, empowering lots of aggrieved parties to do their own takedowns. The civil version of the DMCA has already been more effective in limiting programmer speech than 20 years of ITAR and BXA regs were - not because the penalties are scarier, but because they're swifter, more certain, and applied to upstream providers instead of actual infringers, which changes those providers into reluctant (but effective) local enforcers.
(this is just a corporate/institutional version of "the policeman inside", discussed eventually on the list every time the "make bombs d00d" topic occurs - see
Whereas many people reasonably calculated that their odds of being successfully prosecuted under a criminal enforcement scheme are very low - just look at the ratio of law enforcement agents to individuals using the Internet - broadening the categories of "enforcer" and "viable target" changes that calculation dramatically. By making every content provider a virtual prosecutor, and every ISP/web host/web page publisher/remailer a target, it's a lot easier to find someone to sue - and with that kind of risk in the air, potential targets get a lot more conservative and interested in suppressing the behavior in question.
Yeah - at least if the content isn't nested-encrypted, such that there's no reasonable way to identify content or its source.

I don't think the problem here is really the power of the market - it's the ease of copying digital media, and the difficulty of keeping a secret. I think a disclosure program like you discuss isn't an awful idea - and it might make sense for crypto companies to include, as part of their sales contracts with government agencies, explicit permission to disclose those purchases for public awareness and marketing purposes.
But any such disclosure list is going to be incomplete, because the sellers themselves don't know who they're selling to, or who their customers are passing the goods along to.
It's the same old crypto export control problem - but now we're thinking of the US government as the bad guys, instead of the government of Iraq - and all of the practical objections to the export control nonsense still make as much sense as they ever did. And the ease of circumventing the control regime still makes it a laughingstock, or just a marketing exercise.
(See, for example, the PROMIS software package - licensed by Inslaw to DoJ, and from there distributed far and wide, depending on who you believe. A Google search on "promis inslaw casolaro" will provide a catalog of real or imagined government abuses of small software sellers.)
I agree that we in the US have much more to fear from our government than from the government of Iraq - and perhaps the moral or strategic questions about arms control weigh even more heavily against giving the US government strong privacy or encryption or monitoring tools - but those moral questions are irrelevant given the speed and ease of distribution in the modern world. We can't control the spread of drugs, or guns, or money, or crypto, or surveillance tools - not as a government, and certainly not as individuals or small companies.
Given those constraints on our abilities, publishers of crypto/privacy tools must assume that, when they make any significant distribution of their products, some of them will end up in the hands of government agencies, who will use them (if they're useful) and disassemble/analyze them to find exploitable weakness. That's not really different from what others - like hostile foreign governments, or motivated criminals, will do with them.
Similarly, citizens must assume that, if tools are available to anyone, that they are available to governments, and to the least honest and least honorable and least humanitarian people within those governments, and plan their affairs accordingly.
There's no other realistic path - we can agree that it would be nice if governments didn't perceive a need to mislead and deceive their own citizens, and if governments would follow their own laws - just as it would be nice if other humans would follow laws and act decently, too. But they won't, not all of them. So we've got to  make our plans assuming that the worst people are going to get access, sooner or later, to the best tools, and they're going to lie to us about it along the way.
And that's what we've got to work with - but we can have the good tools, too, if we choose them.

And, in the spirit of full disclosure, I'll mention that at C2Net we did sell our software to the government/intelligence agencies who wanted it - they paid the same prices as any other customers, signed the same sales contracts (we'd negotiate some on warranty terms for big purchases), and otherwise got what everyone else got - not more, not less.
In the book "Peopleware", it's argued that software quality is important not because customers demand it (they don't), but because it makes developers happy to make something they're proud of, and happy developers are more productive and are retained longer. I thought then (96-98) and still think that it might be sensible for small crypto/privacy oriented-companies to refuse to sell to government bodies - not because it would realistically prevent the TLA's from gaining access or information, but because it would be a good marketing trick, especially back when the LEO/intel agencies were 100% behind Clipper and very restrictive export/escrow policies. In terms of customer and employee morale, it might be helpful to be "that company who tells the government to fuck off for moral reasons", which is something that ideological leftists and ideological libertarians can get excited about, and excited customers and employees are good for business.
It also might be a sensible posture for a small, fast-moving high-volume company that doesn't want to fuck around with the overhead involved with government sales - they typically took 2x or 3x as long to close as private-sector sales, and had extra mandatory forms to fill out where they wanted to know about the race and gender of the business owner(s), and then paid us on 90 or 120 day or worse terms because what were we going to do, sue them? On the other hand, it also looks like a good opportunity for a captive government reseller subsidiary, which has a couple of really laid-back slow people on staff who don't mind filling out forms, and charge 2x the regular retail price (which is available only to cash/credit card customers) in exchange for waiting 120 days for payment. But we didn't have spare cycles to fuck around with that, though some companies do, and they seem to do pretty well with it.

I think this goes a little too far (though I'm also pretty skeptical about the underlying proposal). True, it's very unlikely that cops will arrest themselves for violating a mandatory disclosure law - expecting any group to reliably self-police is unrealistic.
It would not be practically, impossible, to enforce such a provision the same way that parts of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth amendments are - by making evidence which has been gathered illegally unavailable in court. That sanction isn't intended to be punitive - it just removes (some of) the motivation to engage in the forbidden activity.

Didn't happen - at least not within my knowledge. I don't think we'd have been willing to have one, given our crypto export control stance (and paranoia about law enforcement) at that point. Given the state of the law at that time (lots of this was before Patel's rulings in _Bernstein_, during the ITAR period before BXA took over crypto regs, and way before the export liberalization), we weren't at all sure we weren't going to be arrested and made examples of, cf. Dmitry Sklyarov.
Law enforcement never asked for a meeting, probably because of (a) ignorance of or disinterest in the technology, or (b) if they did understand it, they also understood that we were essentially selling Apache-SSL (from a technical standpoint), so if they wanted a copy to beat up on, they could build it themselves - they didn't need an RSA license to legitimize their internal/research copies.
We did get a moderate amount of interest in the remailers/anonymizers which ran at C2 in the early days, and later were run somewhere else but whose domain name was held by C2; callers on that topic generally got a nice long explanation of how remailers work, how we didn't know the identity of the person running the remailer nor its physical location, why we supported remailers as free speech tools, and how as a provider of DNS lookups we never had any logs of activity in the first place to disclose, whether or not we had wanted to, court order or not. Complainers pretty much went away after getting the explanation, save for one publisher of avant-garde fonts who never did give up trying to cajole or scare us into giving out the information we didn't have, and/or shutting down DNS to the privacy stuff.
I think ZKS' technology is more interesting and more threatening to law enforcement than our web crypto tools were - there's still not a lot of evil or disorder that goes on related to, literally, the web - I get the impression that law enforcement is a lot more interested in IRC, email, and other communications which are either more personal and immediate, or much less personal and immediate (like Usenet). Web sites are still relatively static, which means their providers are pretty easily identified, which means not so much bad stuff happens there.

Sure, that's an understandable sentiment, but isn't this also isolating the good (or teachable) people inside government who might be open-minded about freedom or crypto or whatever, such that they can't learn from us, and such that (in the case of anonymizing tools) they can't leak information?
I think there's an argument that it's useful to provide pipes into secretive organizations which allow insiders to release information with reduced fear of internal retaliation - sure, they may be used for provocation and disinformation, but they also may be used for and by decent (Like, for example, Fred Whitehurst, a supervisory special agent in the FBI's crime lab, who revealed systematic dishonesty, incompetence, perjury, and contamination in the agency's high-profile analytic & forensic operations - see  or I don't think this question is as easy as it sounds at first.

Everything I've mentioned about C2Net is now several years old - I left the company in the last few months of 1998, and they've since been acquired and swallowed-up by Red Hat (RHAT), and (almost?) everyone who worked there when I was there has also left. If I weren't confident that I'm talking about history, not current events, I wouldn't be saying anything. (.. and there are some parts of the C2Net history which I'll likely never be in a position to disclose, ethically speaking, because of the nature of my relationship (general counsel) with the organization. Caveat emptor.)
We did take an active interest in the security of our systems and codebase - I don't think we were perfect, with respect to physical or electronic security, but we were pretty paranoid, perhaps at some cost to the personal lives of the principals involved.
But your points about insider risks are well taken - especially given that most security incidents have an inside, not outside, source. I believe that the software we published was free of intentional holes or errors, and was built as carefully as we knew how; that belief is based on my familiarity with the build environment, and my knowledge over several years of the people involved in the development process, and my impressions of their competence and integrity.
Still, people's expectations and faith in other people can be misplaced - c.f. Aldrich Ames, Robert Hanssen (a personal friend of James [Puzzle Palace, Body of Secrets] Bamford, who never suspected), and Brian Regan - I don't know of any method or practice which can prevent hidden betrayal, for love or money or boredom or personal animus. And Ken Thompson's "Reflections on Trusting Trust"  serves as a reminder of how subtle a betrayal or compromise can be, yet remain active and dangerous.
A big part of our counter-economic-coercion resistance was ideological - if people really believe that they're working to protect and defend freedom and privacy, it's hard to tempt them with money, at least not just a little money. On the other hand, it's easier to tempt them with ideological arguments, which are cheaper; or for them to become so entranced with each other's political correctness that they lose sight of basic personal integrity and decency. (We didn't have trouble with that at C2Net, but it's historically been a problem inside ideologically-motivated organizations or Pride goeth before destruction; and a haughty spirit before a fall.

The "common carrier" argument never went anywhere - it was a reasonable early effort to discuss the liability rules which might be appropriate for online services; but that's not the way that the law has developed, and it's no longer considered a reasonable line of thinking. Even traditional common carriers (like phone companies) aren't likely to fit the definition of "common carrier" when they're operating as ISP's or other online service providers - e.g., pacbell.com, the company which provides local phone service as an SBC subsidiary, is still a common carrier for many purposes - but pacbell.net, the company which provides DSL connectivity, Usenet news, email, and web hosting for residential and business customers, is *not* a common carrier as that term has traditionally been used. That arm of the business is likely considered an "enhanced service provider", in FCC and PUC-speak, and doesn't get the benefit (or the burden) of traditional common carrier rules.
(Don't forget, common carriers usually have to publish rate schedules, stick to published rates for all subscribers, seek regulatory permission to change their rates, participate in administrative proceedings concerning their rates charged to customers and rates of return on capital, etc - it is absolutely not some magic badge of publisher freedom which one can assume and then wield as a shield against any form of regulation. It's more like a deal with the regulatory devil, whereby one gains some short-term exemptions in exchange for eternal obesiance to a byzantine regulatory apparatus with no hope of salvation.)
Even "publisher" is relatively outdated - the relevant definitions and liability rules are found in the Communications Decency Act (it wasn't all struck down; see 47 USC 230) and the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (17 USC 512), if you're talking about liability for online service providers.

While it's understandable that people want to avoid being swept up in hysterical backlashes against people involved in this morning's terrorist activity, it's worth remembering - especially for people interested in aiding law enforcement - that a lot of investigations begin and move forward with anonymous tips which are later corroborated by witnesses willing to testify. Given the clear indifference for human life shown by the terrorists, the ordinary witness-protection steps taken by law enforcement may not be comforting enough to allow aiders and abettors of this morning's actions to report their knowledge with confidence - so it may be more important than ever that the remailers continue to operate.

I get the impression that our anonymous correspondent Nomen Nescio (n.b., "nomen nescio" is Latin for "I do not know the the name") is suffering from overexposure to academic discussion, which leads (in some cases) to the impression that the world is full of important policy questions patiently awaiting discussion and analysis ad infinitum (and ad nauseum) by anyone who cares to play Socrates today - and that, pending resolution of irresolvable questions, no action shall be taken, and ongoing activities frozen, until perfect consensus can be reached or a widely-acclaimed policy can be drafted.
I propose that this sort of discussion - about whether or not, in the face of violence and tragedy, some aspect of human freedom and expression can be suitably "justified" to satisfy every self-appointed devil's advocate - is absolutely unproductive and serves only to suck energy and concentration from more interesting projects.
I don't know (and don't care) if Nomen is an authentic participant in cypherpunks, a nom-de-plume of another subscriber used to advance unpopular arguments (perhaps in hopes of eliciting stronger arguments in favor of that person's real beliefs), an agent provocateur, or something else .. Nomen's internal state is unimportant. The effect of his/her messages is to create a swamp of self-referential argument and discussion which advances nothing; and I suggest that we'd all do well to learn to ignore Nomen as many of us do Choate (and Vulis and Detweiler in times past.)
Accordingly, I will not answer Nomen's arguments or questions, but report that I have succeeded in compiling Mixmaster 2.9beta23 on the FreeBSD 4.4 release candidate, and in concert with other cpunks, am putting together a 2.9beta24 package which includes a number of patches recently circulated. We have assembled and are testing an installation of that new release on a well-connected machine in a favorable jurisdiction, with more "hardened" remailer installations on the way.

Ah, no. Try a Google search for "remailer at ideath.goldenbear.com", and you'll find plenty of references to the remailer I ran in 1994-1995. (I don't remember when I started - there's a reasonable chance it was in the fall of 1993, but honest remailers don't keep logs . . )
I think remailers are ideally run either by people/organizations with very few resources (so they're not attractive litigation targets) or substantial resources (so they can defend themselves vigorously & aggressively vs. litigation) and right now I find myself somewhere in between those two poles. Nevertheless, the events of the past few days have changed the risk/benefit ratio such that I believe the risks of inaction on my part are worse than the risks of acting.
I'm going into it because I think it's important to provide actual and symbolic support for freedom and privacy when those values appear to be under attack by people like you, who would assume the title of "conscience" and "protector" in order to render people helpless, practically or legally.

2.      A big centralized database/control center, where serious-looking men with guns and uniforms will sit in swivel chairs and look at computer screens 24x7, using zoom lenses and database queries to inspect every movement or deviation from what's considered normal?
This isn't just a technical question, it's a marketing question, and people are learning/have learned to feel safer when someone's monitoring them, and others, too.
People believe that their experience as a subject of control and the exercise of power makes them safe - and that the feeling of not being controlled, or the idea that others are not being actively controlled (or at least monitored, to ensure that their internalized controls are functioning) is scary to them.
Things aren't going to get better until people learn to abandon the false security of the control fetish, and learn to operate in an environment where uncertainty and risk are significant factors.

Earlier I mentioned that I was having difficulty building the current Mixmaster on FreeBSD - I'm confident that I've identified the problem.
Specifically, the OpenSSL that's integrated into FreeBSD doesn't include IDEA, by default, because of patent concerns. To remedy that, one needs to change the line in /etc/defaults/make.conf so that it reads "MAKE_IDEA=YES".
Then - this is the part I missed before - it's necessary to recompile the system libraries, so that they're rebuilt with IDEA support included. It sounds simple in retrospect . . . go to /usr/src and run "make buildworld; make installworld", which may take 12 hours or so on a slow PC. There's got to be a better way to just rebuild the crypto parts, but I didn't stumble across it yet.
After those steps are completed, the Mixmaster stuff builds and runs happily. Mixmaster 2.9beta23 is available at  or I suspect that the OpenBSD fix will be similar, but it may take some time to track it all down.

I suspect they avoid criminal liability by cooperating fully with law enforcement, so that even where they're technically guilty (or indictable) they have no realistic fear of prosecution; and that they avoid civil liability because domestic infringers will be attacked by IP holders directly, and foreign infringers will have their goods seized during Customs inspections, so Fedex et al never really get a chance to contribute to the infringement.
