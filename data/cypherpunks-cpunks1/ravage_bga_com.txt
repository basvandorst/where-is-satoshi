Of course a singularity can be contained in a volume (not shure what you mean
by surface), it is in the universe after all.
I fail to see how this solves anything.

@_subject: Bekenstein Bound 
First off, Black holes are singularities or points and have no volumes.
Second, the 'surface' of the event horizon is a fractal and is therefore
better represented by a volume.
Third, Black holes are not de-coupled from the rest of the universe, they emit 'Hawkings Radiation' which eventually leads to the evaporatio of every
black hole, the bigger the faster.
State shifts, such as a electron or the collapse of a Hamiltonian in a 2
slip experiment take zero time. The issue of time is irrelevant.
Fifth, volume is not an issue because several accepted theories imply a 'many worlds' type of reality. Some of these theories even allow a certain       amount of information to leak between them. This occurs because when the Hamiltonian is constructed some states prevent or exclude other states and the
state space turns out to be smaller than at first apparent.
Sixth, everyone (incl. me initialy) was discussing QED in exclusion. This is completely incorrect. You must include QCD and it is a complete unknown at this
point. When QED succeded because of Feynmann the tools were applied to the Quantuam Chromodynamics of Quarks and it has not solved any problems.
I did a little scrounging around last nite in my library and came up with w
books which discuss aspects of this without burying it in math.

I appreciate your feedback. From what I have read of Hawkings and others work
I would have to disagree w/ your statements that a black hole is equated w/
the event horizon. In every text (incl. the Hawkings book from the 70's on
the subject) to makes a clear distinction.
Several years ago (around '90) there was a whole raft of work dealing w/ the event horizon and the consensus that I got was that the event horizon was a fractal. Perhaps you would site some references where this theory is not
accepted and a argumetn as to why it fails?
What I am saying as far as QED/QCD is that w/o discussing both then the actions
of electrons and photons are not quantum mechanical in the sense that they
require statistical terms to describe their behaviour. Nowhere in Maxwells Equations is there a statistical term. If you know of a hole in the equations
please let me know of it. I am not aware of any behaviour of electrons/photons
which are not covered by these equations until hadrons are introduced.

Seems to me a simpler method would be to start at the end game and work
backward. Start w/ a single piece and it has 64 positions. a game which
ends w/ 2 pieces on the board has 64*63 possible positions, 3 pieces have
64*63*62 possible positions, and so on. The fact is that the end game is what
defines a game of chess and not the infinitude of possible paths between the
first and last move.

You made the assertion in your rebuttal about area -v- volume in relation
to black holes and event horizons about the entire universe not being   containable in a volumn, if you accept this premice then you have to accept
the premice that the universe is unbouded and hence not containable. This leads the bounds on the B-equation to be infinitly large number of possible

I would say such attitudes cease to be legitimate about the time they
are expressed. This is a democracy and every(!) citizen has a right
to express their pleasure and displeasure at the society we each build.
If a person were to say some thing along those lines I would tell them this
is my country and if I don't like it I will change it. They are welcome
to meet me somewhere in the middle if they are even remotely open minded (which rules out all standard political parties with an agenda based on
obtaining a majority instead of finding a middle ground for everyone to
live their own lives under). A government/society is something similar to
a forest, it is silly to think of it without also considering the plight of
the individual tree (the whole point of the Bill of Rights I believe). An
example would be position and velocity relating to uncertainty principles
in physics. You can't now both position and velocity to a arbitary precision
and governments can't write laws which don't have inherent limitations to
their applicability to both society and the individual. They are opposite
sides of the same coin.
The persons who express such monotheistic views are the ones who should move

And the 'government' had no authority without the city and such other

can be thrown out of school or otherwise punished. Authority in the sense of government regulation (if the word is used correctly) means
that the persons assuming the authority can impose actions upon you and
your property WITHOUT your permission AND use force if necessary.
A police officer caries that gun on their hip because they are saying
EXPLICITLY that they will shoot you dead if provoked enough. Provoking
a authority figure means not doing what they want done the way they want it done.

Can't speak for MIT but I can speak for UT Austin, they do have cells to hold
prisoners. The security forces at that school attend the Tx Dept. of Public
Safety training school and hold state law enforcement positions. The last
thing you want to do is really piss one of these guys, you would end up
in one of the state prisons for several years, Huntsville probably.
Schools can use physical force against their students. I have personaly seen
assaults on the presidents office when a group of students took it over in
the late 80's because of UT Austin holdings in S. Africa.  I have seen them
knock the holy shit out of students for nothing more than simply refusing to
move fast enough. The officers stormed the office in full riot gear with M16 automatic rifles and smoke grenades.
I suspect that MIT's security forces, even though it is a private school,
hold 'peace officer' ratings and this implies that they can carry weapons
at any time (though they don't usually). This holds for the small community
college that I work at now as well. The officers don't carry guns as a regular
part of their uniform except during registration when there are large amounts
of cash on campus or when important officials visit the campus(es).
Contact the head of security at MIT and ask for a tour of their facilities.
they usually grant such requests.

The ammo used by the A-10 chain gun uses a depleted uranium core that is
designed to defeat Chobam and other types of reactive armor. It is also used in F-14, F-15, F-16, and F-18's that are tasked with ground attack
missions where active armor tanks are expected to be encountered. The ammo
was specificaly developed for use in the late 70's for use against Soviet
T-72's in a Fulda Gap scenario.
I know of no ammo that uses anything other than brass or steel (in the case of mini-guns and other motor driven guns) for the case. The reason
that the Uranium is used is because of its high density.

I would like to request some reference on the use of Uranium in the casing
of a shell or round. The casing gets thrown out on the ground (by both
aircraft and tanks) when the round goes off. There is no reason to use
anything other than brass or steel for this.
As to the use in a round, the idea is like a sabot. When the ke of the shell
is conserved on impact the more massive core goes right on into the target.
I can find no reference any U-core round being HE or otherwise carrying a charge. In all cases that I am aware of and can find reference to it is simply
a KE attack on the target where the by products of the impact bounce around
inside the target grinding up whatever is in there.

If your spelling is correct then several of my books have mis-spellings.
As to Chob(h)am bing classified, this was true till the late 80's. It is
a ceramic based layered with cintered metallics that dissipate the KE
of the incoming round.      The Russians also developed this method for the T-72's at about the same
time. It was discovered that the 'applique' armor on the T-72 was really
this type of armor that could be bolted on. The reason that I lump the
two together is that they both require a dual warhead to defeat.
I have seen the exact same chain-gun mounted on F-16's and A-10's here at
Bergstron AFB in Austin at at least two different air shows. I am going on
this alone. I do not know if this was ever an active use of the gun.
Could you provide references for this application? I did technical support
for Desert Storm and know of no use of such depleted armor in that campaign.

That is called the 'jacket' in all the years I have handled weapons that is
the only correct term for it. The casing is where the powder goes.
We were not talking about artillery pieces in relation to the comment by me on
this issue. I know little about artillery, I do know about tanks and aircraft
because they are a life long interest for me.
The pieces in most cases are simply slivers of metal that breaks off the
inside of the tank because of hyper-sonic shockwaves.  They are not molten
and do not in general cause a fire. Other than a lucky hit on a live
round with the ammo door open there is little chance of starting a fire.

First get folks used to using it for order only, then later on add some
form of 'shell' where a limited form of credit (purchased off-line) can be used (minimizes if not eliminates spoofing of credit). As the  folks
get more used to it then add even more features. Sounds a lot like fishing...:)

I suspect the shippers will surrender their shipping documents when they are

As to using an anonymouse third party, by placing them at risk this opens them
up to various tactics. For instance, they could be given immunity from any charges and then they would be compelled to rat me out.
In every example that deals with the delivery of tangible goods (which is the
majority of what we purchase) the anonymity breaks down at the delivery point.

RE: Computer Generated Random Numbers
A few closing comments and requests for further information:
1.  All my tests on random number generators were performed on VAX/VMS
    computers.  VAX uses a 32-bit architecture, so the random number
    generators I tested were ones which used a word size of 32 bits or
    less.  I would be interested in anybody's test results of a random
    number generator utilizing a larger word size, such as xrand() using
    SIZE=63.
2.  Anyone know of some good references on primitive polynomials mod 2
    and their applications?  They're used in additive congruential
    random number generators like the xrand() one tested here.  They're
    also used by file transfer programs such as xmodem to insure error
    free transmission, and they're used in cryptography too.  Anyone
    know of a good book on Abstract Algebra?  (The ones I have just
    briefly touch the topic and then move on.)
3.  Resolution:  Usually the random number generator is set up to return
    a floating point value between 0 and 1.  A typical floating point
    variable R can only represent a finite number of different values
    between 0 and 1.  If you magnify the result too much the
    discreetness of the floating point datum will become obvious.  For
    example, in VAX architecture the F-floating datum has a precision of
    approximately one part in 2**23.  Multiplying R by a very large
    number N to create a random variable between 0 and N will fail if N
    is too large because some of the values between 0 and N have no
    corresponding R value which maps to them (i.e. the mapping is no
    longer a surjection or onto map).
    For an F_floating datum, N above 2**23 is obviously too large.  But
    even below 2**23 there's still a problem of some bins having 2 R
    values which map to them while other bins have only 1.  We need to
    get N small enough so that the number of R values which maps to any
    bin is about the same, close enough so that differences aren't
    noticed when we test the random number generator.

BSD random()
Here are the partial results.  Further tests were not performed due to
lack of time.  So far the generator appears to be comparable to a
shuffled linear congruential generator.
          DEFINITION:
            Generating polynomial: x^31 + x^3 + 1 (primitive polynomial)
            Initialize circular queue of 31 elements using ANSI C linear
             congruential generator.
            Recursion formula: a[i] = a[i] + a[i-3]
          RATING:
             1-D FAILS above 800,000 bpd      (bins per dimension)
             2-D FAILS above 3000 bpd
             3-D FAILS above 210 bpd
             4-D PASSES at 50 bpd (highest tested so far)
             5-D not tested
             6-D not tested
             7-D not tested
             8-D not tested
This is an additive congruential type random number generator.  An array
table[31] is initially filled with random numbers using the ANSI C
linear congruential random number generator.  Random numbers are then
generated using the recursion formula:
     table[k] = (table[k-31] + table[k-3]) mod 32
(Note that x**31 + x**3 + 1 is a primitive polynomial mod 2, which is
being used here as a generator.)  Since we are using the array table[]
as a circular queue with 31 elements then table[k-31] is just table[k]
before it gets replaced with the new value.  The recursion formula
     table[k] = table[k] + table[k-3]
The generator works well in practice.  Knuth claims the sequence will
have period 2**31 - 1.  Knuth also claims there is very little theory to
prove that this generator does or does not have desirable random
properties.  I would be interested if anyone knows of any recent
developments in this area.

C CHIKSN.FOR
C This is the program which impliments the chi-square test used to test
C random number generators.  Presented here if you would wish to play
C with it yourself, maybe do some testing of your own.  See the paper
C "Computer Generated Random Numbers" sections 4 and 6 for an explanation
C of what this program does.
C This is not polished code you put on a shelf and admire, this is code
C you dig your hands into and work with to make it do what you want it to.
C The main routine is the one to tinker with.  This code is meant to be
C modified to suit your needs.  The goal is to fill up the bins with
C balls.  Here's a brief outline:
C        1. ASK USER INPUT:
C           a.  Number of dimensions?  NDIM
C           b.  Number of bins per dimension?  NBINSPD
C           c.  Total number of balls to throw at bins?  NBALLS
C           d.  Number of tests to run?  NCHITESTS
C           e.  Random number generator to use (if more than one defined)
C           f.  SEED value to initialize generator with
C        2. CREATE ARRAY BINS and ZERO ARRAY
C        3. THROW THE BALLS AT THE BINS and CALCULATE PROBABILITY:
C              LOOP (do CHITEST=1 to NCHITESTS)
C                 zero BIN array
C                 LOOP (do J=1 to NBALLS)
C                    get random numbers r1,r2,...,rn)
C                    increment BIN(r1,r2,...,rn)
C                 ENDLOOP
C                 CALL CHSONE to calculate chi-square probability
C              ENDLOOP
C              CALL KSONE to calculate Kolmogorov-Smirnov probability
C The main routine here is where you put a call to your random number
C generator, or for speed you can attempt a direct implimentation of your
C random number generator to save the overhead of a call.  (It can make a
C difference when you call the random number generator 100 million times
C in one test).
C The main routine defines a large one-dimensional array called BINS, the
C maximum size of which would depend on your account quotas and machine
C specific limitations.  The array BINS keeps track of how many balls have
C fallen into each bin.  The size of array BINS determines the maximum
C number of bins a user may select for a test.  (10,000,000 bins is a
C typical number you may want to use if possible.)
C So steps are:
C     1.  Check definition of one-dimensional array NBINS
C         that it's not too large for your account quotas
C         or system limitations.
C     2.  Place your random number generator to be tested where it
C         bluntly says "PLACE YOUR RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR HERE".
C         The output is an integer IRANDOM between 0 and NBINS-1
C         (NBINS is the number of bins chosen by the user).
C         Currently the program is set up to use subroutine RAN1, a portable
C         random number generator from the book "NUMERICAL RECIPES: The Art
C         of Scientific Computing".  I've had trouble on our UNIX system
C         not making array R(97) static even though the code says to.
C         Compiling with the -static qualifier works.
C The random number generator being tested is used to "randomly" select a
C bin for the ball to fall in, and the counter for that bin is
C incremented.  Note for a multi-dimensional test we calculate the
C appropriate index into the linear array BINS by hand.  After all the
C balls are thrown we call the subroutines to do the heavy math.
C All the subroutines should be fairly standard FORTRAN-77 modified
C versions of routines from the book "NUMERICAL RECIPES: The Art of
C Scientific Computing" by William H. Press, Brian P.  Flannery, Saul A.
C Teukolsky, and William T. Vetterling, and you should look there for
C further reference as to what the routines are doing.  (Note: the book
C comes in several programming language forms including C, PASCAL, BASIC,
C as well as FORTRAN, so you can take your pick and rewrite this code in
C any language you please.)
C Note:
C    CHIKSN.FOR is currently set up to be run by a process with a very
C    large page file quota (pgflquo).  If you get a 'exceed quota' error
C    attempting to run this then all you need to do is change the line
C    which reads:
C       	INTEGER*2 BINS(20 000 000)	!The bins.
C    to something smaller like:
C    	INTEGER*2 BINS(1 000 000)	!The bins.
C To compile:
C      $ FORTRAN CHIKSN
C      $ LINK CHIKSN
C or
C     % f77 chiksn.f      !(Some UNIX F77 compilers require -save option)
C Sample run:
C   Test MTH$RANDOM in 3-D with 10 bins per dimension and 10 balls per bin:
C      $ RUN CHIKSN
C      Input number of dimensions NDIM: 3
C      Input number of bins per dimension NBINSPD: 10
C      Total number of bins = NBINSPD**NDIM =         1000
C      Minimum number of balls = 5*NBINS =         5000
C      Input total number of balls NBALLS: 10000
C      Input number of Chi-Square tests NCHITESTS (min=2) : 2
C      Choose random number generator to test
C        (1) MTH$RANDOM,
C        (2) RANDU,
C        (3) ANSI C,
C        (4) Microsoft C
C        (5) Turbo Pascal
C        (6) DES
C        : 1
C      Input starting SEED value: 1
C      BALLS=       10000   CHISQ=    993.0002441   PROB=      0.4524292
C      BALLS=       10000   CHISQ=    974.0001831   PROB=      0.2915459
C      KS D=      0.5475708  PROB=      0.5863269
C  Perform a CHI-SQUARE test on a sequence of sets of N random numbers
C  NDIM      = number of dimensions
C  NBINSPD   = number of bins per dimension
C  NBINS     = total number of bins.  NBINS = NBINSPD**NDIM
C  NBALLS    = total number of balls.  Should be at least 5*(NBINS**NDIM)
C  NCHITESTS = Number of chi-square tests to do.  Must be 2 or more.
C  EBINS     = Expected value for each bin.  EBINS = NBALLS/NBINS
C  SEED      = Initial seed value for random number generator
C Note 1:  The maximum size of array NBINS may be determined by the users
C          page file quota (pgflquo in AUTHORIZE).  Also, it is recommended
C          the user have a very large working set quota (wsquo,wsextent)
C          to reduce page faulting.  This can greatly improve speed.
C          We use INTEGER*2 array here to save space.
C Note 2:  The maximum number of Chi-Square tests that can be saved is
C          arbitrary (array SAVEPROB).  The user may choose any value.
C Note 3:  The user may choose any starting seed value.  Some restrictions
C          may apply depending upon the particular random number generator
C          being used.  For example, RANDU should always be started with
C          an odd value of SEED.  MTH$RANDOM may be started with any value
C          of SEED.
C Note 4:  The MTH$RANDOM generator is used by the VAX FORTRAN intrinsic
C          function RAN and the VAX BASIC function RND.  It is defined as:
C               SEED = 69069*SEED + 1 mod 2**32
C               X = SEED/2**32
C Note 5:  The RANDU generator is obsolite due to very strong correlation
C          in 3d space.  ( Prove to yourself using 65539 = 2**16 + 3 that
C          SEED[i+2] = 6*SEED[i+1] - 9*SEED[i] ).  It is defined as:
C               SEED = 65539*SEED mod 2**31
C               X = SEED/2**31
C          The RANDU generator should be started with an odd value of SEED.
C Note 6:  The C standard library function rand() is defined as:
C               SEED = 1103515245*SEED + 12345 mod 2**32
C	        IX = SEED mod 2**31
C          This standard random number generator is defined in the book:
C               The C Programming Language
C               Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie
C               Prentice Hall, 1978
C          The same generator is defined in the ANSI C version by the same
C          authors above, and the same generator is used in VAX C.
C Note 7:  The Microsoft C version 4.0 library function rand() impliments
C          the following:
C               SEED = 214013*SEED + 2531011 mod 2**32
C               IX = bits 16-31 of SEED
C Note 8:  The Turbo Pascal version 6.0 function impliments the following:
C               SEED = 134775813*SEED + 1 mod 2**32
C               IX = bits 16-32 of SEED

C  Perform a KS test comparing the first 100 elements of a random

C you dig your hands into and work with to make it do what you want it to.
C     Place your random number generator to be tested where it
C     bluntly says "PLACE YOUR RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR HERE".
C     The output is a floating point between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
C    Currently the program is set up to use subroutine RAN1, a portable
C    random number generator from the book "NUMERICAL RECIPES: The Art
C    of Scientific Computing".  I've had trouble on our UNIX system
C    not making array R(97) static even though the code says to.
C    Compiling with the -static qualifier works.

! Performs the spectral test for a linear congruential random number generator.
! !  This program adapted from:
!     ALGORYTHM  AS 193 APPLIED STATISTICS, (1983) VOL. 32, NO.3 PG. 328-335
!     T. R. Hopkins
! Modified to run on VAX/VMS systems using REAL*16 (64 bit) variables.
! The original is FORTRAN-66 compliant.
! Consider linear congruential generators of the form:
!		SEED = (A*SEED + C) mod M
! Given A, and M, the spectral test calculates NUSQ (NU**2), LOGNU (base 2),
! and MU.  As a guide, Knuth suggests a multiplier A may be considered
! adequate if the values of MU returned by the spectral test are > 0.1 .
! For an exceptionally good multiplier, these values will all be greater
! than unity.
! The spectral test may be applied if:
!    1.  The sequence has maximal period, or
!    2.  M is prime and C = 0 and the period length is M-1, or
!    3.  M = 2**e and A mod 8 = 5 or A mod 8 = 3.
!        In this third case the spectral test is applied using
!        A = A and M = 2**(e-2).  For example, in analyzing RANDU,
!        use A = 65539 and M = 536870912 (2**29).
! Further information on the spectral test is in:
!   Knuth, Donald E.  "The Art of Computer Programming Vol. 2: Seminumerical
!     algorithms, 2nd edition.  Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley. 1981
! The value of parameter BIGT determines how many dimensions are calculated.
! Higher dimensions may be obtained by changing this parameter and recompiling.
! Note that 12 is about the highest feasible.  Above 12 the program may take
! days to complete.

I did a research paper on Computer Generated Random Number Sequences in
1991.  Included are the results of testing numerous popular generators.
The code used for testing the generators is also available if one
is so inclined to do some testing of a particular generator.  (The only
thing is a thorough test to determine the limits of the generator can
take many hours of CPU time).
Perhaps later this week I'll post the paper and see what the response
is.  I'm always a bit apprehensive to post.  Never sure what the
response will be.  Maybe someone will think it's interesting.

     Hello,
the BSD random() function returns a pseudo random number. I would like
to know if anyone knows how good this random number generator is and
if it has been thouroughly tested. Below are two descriptions of the
generator for two different sources. Looking at the source code it is
obvious that this generator is seeded using a linear congruetial
generator that leaves much to be desired (low bits alternate). I
remember reading somewhere that the trinomials used by random() are
not optimal but I can't remember the source. The generator does have
some great advantages like being very fast and having a very long
period, but both these advantages are meaningless if the random
numbers it produces are not very good. Anyone know more about random()
and if it is any good?
I have include a source code implementation below (I wrote it
originally so I could inline the code into my own application which
spend a significant amount of time generating random numbers).
   - henrik
According to the SunOS doc's:
"random () uses a non-linear additive feedback random number
generator employing a default table of size 31 long integers
to return successive pseudo-random numbers in the range from
0  to (2**31)-1.  The period of this random number generator
is very large, approximately 16*((2**31)-1)."
The BSD source code (from glibc) says:
"The random number generation technique is a linear feedback shift
register approach, employing trinomials (since there are fewer terms
to sum up that way).  In this approach, the least significant bit of
all the numbers in the state table will act as a linear feedback shift
register, and will have period 2^deg - 1 (where deg is the degree of
the polynomial being used, assuming that the polynomial is irreducible
and primitive).  The higher order bits will have longer periods, since
their values are also influenced by pseudo-random carries out of the
lower bits.  The total period of the generator is approximately
deg*(2**deg - 1); thus doubling the amount of state information has a
vast influence on the period of the generator."
For table size of 31 long ints random() use the trinomial: x**31 +
x**3 + 1. For 63 long ints it uses the trinomial x**63 + x + 1.
   Code to implement random() & srandom() of BSD Unix. It was taken
   (though coded somewhat differently) from the Gnu BSD implementation.

The classic reference is Volume 2 of Donald Knuth's The Art of Computer
Programming, Second Edition, Seminumerical Algorithms. I highly recommend
it to anyone wanting to know what "random" is all about.
If you really need to know whether your generator is random-enough for
your application you should expect to do your own testing and yes it will
require many hours of your time in addition to that of your computer.

knuth's chapter's practical results are about linear-congruential
rngs, their optimization and testing. though these rngs are still
distressingly common, nonlinear rngs are the way to go for two
burgeoning areas that consume random numbers: graphics and cryptography.
both areas are concerned with getting extremely long periods, but
cryptography is also concerned with proving unpredictability of
secure rngs. that is, knowing some outputs of an rng as applied to a
given seed, it should be impossible to deduce or predict other
outputs' values.
so, you see, the "good test for randomness" depends strongly on which
features of a random variable you want to use. if you're careful,
knuth's approach will work fine for some statistical applications,
like monte-carlo techniques. but knuth's is by no means the last
word on the subject. btw, for cryptographic purposes, the received
wisdom is that there is NO adequate test for randomness; if an rng
passes lots of tests, that's very nice, but the presumption is that
the variable's deterministic structure is simply hidden, and that
the clever-enough test was not yet applied or devised.
nevertheless, in the cryptographic field, the list of tests used
is long. typically, you design the test to probe the weaknesses of
a specific rng algorithm.  period tests, runs tests, and
substring-interarrival tests are common, and some people like
entropy estimates. one of the trusted names in the crypto-rng
literature is marsaglia; he has published extensively on the
subject of rng-testing. i don't know what the graphics literature
on rngs is like; i only know that if you want to simulate textured
surfaces, like grass, a bad rng makes a striped texture.
be forwarned: the rng literature is amazingly vast, with a low signal-
to-noise ratio. it seems that everyone thinks he can design a "good"
rng. btw, i favor hardware rngs.

The forwards were crypto related and relevant to some of the members who
don't have anything other than e-mail accounts. How do you propose these
folks get this info?
Also how about those folks who have a low latency system and the posts
in various medium to high traffic systems gets flushed regularly. These
posts were several days old and I suspect in many systems were ready to
flush (they were on mine, I 'tripped' over them doing maintenance for
something else) to the bit bucket.
And do you seriously propose that I or any other member ask prior to submissions? It is really funny that in general I get a few more thanks
for such posts than self-interested rebuttals like this.
While it is true that some of my questions are off the wall, I will continue to ask them. If they bother then .kill me. As an aside to this
I will continue to remail articles of technical interest (what c-punks
is about last I heard anything) that I feel have a good case of being
lost. I would also like to ask a question on a personal (no flame intended) nature. Were you going to post said message about these usenet submissions?
Other than myself I see very few such re-posts from anything other than
a newsgroup w/ 'crypt' in it somehow.
The flame ware, as I understand it anyway, had to do with forwarding multiple copies of EFF and similar material which is minimaly related
to cyrypto and most users actively look for it. I doubt a lot of the users here check out sci.math, sci.chaos, sci.neural-nets, etc. If we are really going to continue this thread then a serious discussion
relating to c-punks and some form of submission standard needs to be agreed
upon.

Actually, no. I couldn't care less about what pushes your buttons.
I came across a couple of crypto related usenet messages that were going in the bit bucket, no reference to them had been made. Yes
I could have typed and typed and typed various messages about them
but it was easier to forward them. I also pay for my accounts out of my own pocket. If you expect to be active in a field you can expect to have to pay a minimum price to become
competant. Bounce away, my 'd' key works just fine. I personaly feel such attitudes
are childish but hey, it is a semi-free country - do what you feel is right.
As to making me pay, is this the c-punks mailing list or a shool-yard?

Hi all,
For those interested there is an article in the July 94 issue of Circuit     Cellar Ink: The Computer Applications Journal on pp. 36.
It specificaly mentions the c-punks and their position (ala Gilmore) on various issues of crypto and constitutional rights. Is a good article but
shallow on technical details. It is intended more as a pump primer for those
poor souls doing real-time control apps.
I would say it is worth the time to read.

Even in your rebuttal you use 'crypto-weak' implying they are crpypto
related. I would appreciate a clarification on exactly what c-punks
means by 'crypto related'....
Seems perfectly clear to me, but obviously there is a major difference of
opinion here.
Yes, I could do that if I were so inclined. I am not. Seems to me that just
forwarding it and letting that be that is a much better way than filling up
the mailing list with bitches about what you think somebody else should do.
Bottem line is that at this point there is no clear cut 'standard' that I have seen agreed on. Hell, I haven't even seen any discussion over it beyond
a bunch of polemics over what people like and don't like, which are not in any way necessarily related to what people need or want. One of the biggest problems w/ the list at this point is the range of expertise that
is present. With such a broad experience base almost any post is going to
piss somebody off. The real question is whether it is worth the time to reply to them (in general I hold it isn't) rather than just hitting 'd'
(which I recommend if you don't like it) and forgetting (even forgoing the
obviously popular habit of acidic replies). If you look at this rationaly all the discussion about pedophilia, eff,
nsa policy, etc. is really not directly related to crypto and coding. If
the main theme of this list is really 'c-punks write code' then my forwarding of the rng discussion (w/ code) is more appropriate to the topics
at hand than any of this other stuff. A very good analogy of how this type
of logic inversion is prevelant is the move to ban guns (no, I do NOT
want any replies to this particular topic, it is for example only!!!!)
by looking at the 2nd Amendment. If taken logicaly the reason for the amendment is to allow individuals to protect themselves against all
threats including the government. If followed through then any move to ban military weapons is un-constitutional and moves to ban non-military weapons are constitution - obviously not the tact taken.
The bottem line is it was crypto related, was in reference to source code,
and therefore fit the charter of this group.

For top of the line crypto, you are absolutely correct. For a learning
resource, I disagree.
The concept of testing a RNG's stabilty and operating characteristics
is something which is directly crypto related. Much more so than pedophilia
or alt.whatever.rainbow.......
To help those who don't have access to this material other than through
e-mail. And no I am not going to create a list of people and manualy
setup some form of sub-list to filter this stuff according to each individuals interest. I don't have the interest, time, or the information
on each and every  member of c-punks to carry this out. RNG's are commenly used in crypto, to understand the more compicated techniques
one must learn the more mundane basics.
My main rationale is that while I see lots of people making suggestions I dont
see any of them actually carrying it out. In the whole time I have been on this list I have *never* seen referals to the newsgroups. I have seen a general trend to repost this material so that people simply have it right then and there instead of having to send a sub-group  roaming around looking
for it. Seems a much more labor saving system.

Go back in your archives and notice that this responce reitterates one
I had made earlier about not seeing such references unless they  came
from a newsgroup with crypt  in it somehow. I didn't lash out at anyone. I posted a set of materials I thought some
might find interesting. If folks like you had left it alone that would
have been the end of it. I would not have made any further communications
on it. However, a certain clique of c-punks seem compelled to reply to
every damn post that gets sent on there, and do it ad nauseum. If the traffic is too high try not replying unless it is a positive contribution.
But, because you folks apparently have nothing  better to do  we have managed to generate a set of list traffic that vastly exceeds the original
forwards. Reminds me of the years I worked in a science museum and people were always
coming around with new projects for me to  do. My general responce became   to
point them to the shop and tell them to have at. I have little respect for
people who have nothing better to do than tell others how to spend their time.
If the suggestion is that great, carry it out yourself.
I didn't condem the list or anyone else for that matter. I *NEVER* said that or anything like it. Geesh, speaking of imagination.

Ok Perry, I am not going to let you off that easily. Could you elucidate why
you feel that such a GUT would not solve this problem even in principle? If
a GUT could answer definitively whether there were a many-worls interpretation
this would definately address at least peripheral aspects of the P=NP problem.
It would also, necessarily, describe some limitations on computations and problem complexity. When one considers that there is no clear definition or proof of the exact solutions methods to prove P=NP it seems premature to posit such a definate
answer. While it might not be true that it would solve the problem in toto
it may be true that a clarification of the boundary conditions might make
the solution easier by reducing the number of choices of methodology one might look at.
I am interested on why you feel a GUT would have no effect, at least, on the boundary conditions of the problem?

Sands which is intended to watch real-time the monetary transactions
of the citizen-units real-time (quite a task if you ask me). It would
not be a stretch of the imagination to see such technology hooked into
a network of intelligent switches for real-time communications monitoring.
In most cases all the AI would need access to is the identity of the parties, not necessarily the entire contents of the communication.
As to the national ID card you refer to, is this the Social Security Card?
If so it is not, nor was it ever meant to be, a national ID card. The only
agencies which *require* access to it are the IRS and the SSA.
Seems to me we are looking at Socialism and not Communism as the trend of the day. Communism implies that we all work together in a 'commune' where all
is owned by all. Socialism however is the belief that the people can handle
small amounts of private ownership and responsibility but ultimately the power resides in the authorities. The situation really reminds me of the post-WWI conditions in Italy when Mussollini took over and instituted facism
as the order of the day. The only good thing one can say about that is that
the trains run on time.
I do not believe this for a minute. Governments and economies are mitigated by psychology not technology. Technology is the means, not the goal. The      information is what is important, not how it is transfered. While it is true
that the existing systems are having a hard time keeping up with the technology
this is due to beurocratic inertia to do it as it has been done in the past
more than any particular aspect of technology which prevents its use by any
particular party. If your thesis is correct then we have nothing to worry about and our 'meeting' here is a waste of our time, we should be out pushing
technology even harder and not worrying about government and its policies in any way. I get the impressio that you feel the world is driven by technology
and I hold that people always have and always will drive the world and how
it turns out. Technology is a means to an end, not an end unto itself.
Take care all.

Hi all,

has two articles about crypto. One is about public key and DES and the general currents. The second is in reference to WinCrypt.
Both articles are very general and do not delve into technical discussion.

Some people I'm working with have built a machine to generate "real"
random numbers, using a BC546 transistor as an avalanche mode noise
diode (12V Vcc).  The noise output is supposedly 100mV peak.  That's
then fed into an LM311 comparator, to generate 0/1 signals.  This is
then fed to a divide-by-2 counter.  When their CPU wants a random
number, it samples the output of the divide-by-2 counter eight times
at 6.25kbit/sec.
They did collect a bunch of samples from this, and claim that successive
samples did seem to be uncorrelated, but there seemed to be a slight bias
in favour of 0 bits.  However, they say the test results have been lost.
I don't really understand how the output of a divide-by-two counter can
be biassed this way
They don't need to produce random numbers at a very high rate (a couple
of hundred a second is more than enough for their application).
I have a faint memory that there are several problems with generating
random numbers from noise diodes, but I can't remember what any of them
are.  The requirement is for
If there is a standard way to get something like this, I'd like to hear

This would of course assume that the police were silly enough to
use the disk and such from your machine in your machine. From my experience w/ Mentor and Erik Blookaxe during Operation Sun Devil this
is not very realistic. As I understand it they took the floppies and the
hard drives out of the original machines and used them on their own. This
was in case their was any 'time-bombs' installed. Another aspect would
be that the machine would have to be turned on. Also it would only work
once. Thereafter they would either examine the equipment in a Farady Cage
or else start doing pager rental scans prior to seizure.

One possible hole here is that since they share a commen algorith then
the algorithm is the 'language' and not the actual messages. This would
mean that you are each using the same language. There is also the aspect
of once discovered you could be charged with obstructing justice which
has very stiff penalties.
They make you participate by giving you immunity in which case you have no

incriminating oneself if you are the defendant) or to incriminate others (and
here we are back to immunity). While it is true you can't be held in contempt of court for not providing something that doesn't exist they can get you for destroying evidence.

The problem with this scenario is that in order to keep the security you must keep the door-opener in your possession for the entire time limit
the key-list is used. All it would take to circumvent it would be to have
somebody gain access to the hardware. Shoot, if you let somebody have access to the opener then it is possible they might put some kind of ghost
on the ram and make it possible for them to do all kinds of stuff to circumvent the list. If you dock each time then you don't need that kind
of security. For them to get at the opener they would need to gain access
to your house in which case they would attack the base-unit.

   I currently don't have any HPR motors, reloads or any such thing. I left them behind when I moved to Georgia (not knowing the legal climate down here). So I feel (relatively) safe putting forth my two cents worth as to what I would do.      First, I would be rigidly legal in every respect. In fact, after hearing about them worrying about casing residue I would make sure I didn't even have so much as a spent D12-0 casing. Anything I needed would be bought enroute to any launch meet, or at the meet itself.      Second, I would endeavor to be as 'safe' and 'peaceful' as possible. There would be no 'terminator 2' talk out of me.
     Third, if I did get attacked, everything would be 'yessir' and 'nossir'.
     Then, I would quietly go down to the federal courthouse and file a RICO Act lawsuit.
     RICO Act stands for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. This is what is commonly referred to as being charged with 'racketeering'. RICO allows individuals (as well as governments) to file against persons or organizations that commit three major offenses against one person or a major offense against three or more persons.
     One unique feature that makes it exceedingly lucrative for lawyers to take on contingency is that the awarded amount is TRIPLE the sum of all court costs,  out-of-pocket costs, compensatory, and punitive damages.
     Certain agencies may be immune but not all of them. Also, you could argue that immunity only applies to their lawfully empowered duties and when they exceed that authority, that they are acting outside of government protection and become private citizens commiting acts against other private citizens.
     There was a church in California in 1979 that began moving to do something like that against the state Attorney General (Dukemajian at the time). The state was trying to take over all of that church's operations (under a law protecting charitable trusts - like United Way) Ex-Parte on the claim from six ex-members that money was being absconded with. California tried to impose their own people into that church's ruling hierarchy & even declared in open court that all churches in California thereafter belonged to the state. The threatened suit plus the outrageously gross misapplication of the law spooked the California legislature into repealing that law completely over the violent protestations of Attorney General Dukemajian. I believe there was a book about this called "Against the Gates of Hell" or something by somebody named Rader.

I have recently come into the possession of 3 working Ridge 3200 super-mini's
running Unix. I intend to place all 3 on a ethernet hooked into my inet feed
and have one as a re-mailer.
On the remialer front what I intend is sorta the following:
1. all messages sent out will be sent encrypted. This will require both
   sender and reciever to have a public key on record w/ the mailer.
2. messages will be cached and re-transmitted after a random delay. I intend
   to generate a random number between 0 and 24. When the appropriate hour
   arrives all messages with that time stamp will be sent encrypted.
3. We intend to support anonymous as well as explicit addressing.
Anyone got any experience w/ Ridge products? I have contacted the designer
and he is willing to help us out (Ridge is out of business) with support
on the 3 machines.
Just for info, of the remaining two - one will be used as a remote ray-trace
engine and the third there just as backup and for playing with. These macnines
are pretty quick from what little experience I have with them.

Why should I trust them at all? Why should I willingy become an occomplice
in any of their activities? I don't anyone, including me, being able to figure out what is going on. But more importantly you seem to assume that
these pair of communicators are not trying to determine something about me
with their traffice. By encrypting the outgoing the reciever is shure that
it came from my re-mailer and not somebody else. If the sender wants to be shure the reciever can verify it is from them they can use their own set
of keys to pass the encrypted traffic. With this technique they can be shure
that the remailer they intended to handle it did so correctly as well as the
original source.
Really? Exactly what are you sending that 24 hrs makes a damn as far as the
reciever getting it? If it is that time critical you aren't going to use a public re-mailer anyway, too unreliable. With a public re-mailer there is
no guarantee that I don't keep a image of the original and go ahead and
pass along a image. I think usefulness is something we each have to decide on. If it works for me and not for you that means absolutely nothing.
If others won't use it, fine by me. I run my system for me and a close
group of associates, if other callers (it is open to the public) find it
inconvenient or strange, too bad. Let them spend their own money and time
and build something exactly like they want. Well I intend for it to use pseudonyms (ie ravage) for this sort of stuff.
I will create a libary of rules (probably in REXX) that will generate a list of names on demand. I really don't find 'anonxxxxx' that interesting.
The users will be able to either select their 'nym or else can generate it
for them.
Unfortunately I don't have control over the traffic on these other systems,
and I suspect most other sysadmins don't either. The bottem line is that
if all a spook looks at is my system I can hide the traffic. If they include in their analysis the 'surrounding' systems then I am out of luch
unless they also take active measures to hide their traffic patterns. The problem I see with this is who pays for it? I spend a couple hundred a month on my systems feeds and such, this is a tidy chunk of change out of
my pocket (I work at a community college) and I suspect few people will
find such expenses worth the effort. Also since my feed is a SLIP bandwidth
is at a premium, bogus packets are not something I will spend a lot of time
generating. In a network of mailers like I envision the layers of encryption
is what provides the protection along w/ the 'nyms.

You can also tell it comes from the remailer because it is encrypted to

information, I *want* to certify where it came from - *not* who(!) is
sending it or *what* is in it. I can see not knowing or being able to
prove the pathway as a possible hole for interjecting bogus packets.
Now, about this re-sending issue. If I rcv. a packet at 10am and it
gets a random time-stamp there is no guarantee when it will be sent
other than within 24hrs. It may or may not be sent in the 5 hr. gap in

@_subject: crypto-remailer traffic... 
Hi all,
Sorry, due to a crash I lost the sender and original message but I did build a reply and will now post it. Hope this isn't too confusing.
On the baud rate issue:
The original position was that 10ea. 10k packets over 24hrs was 10 baud.
This is incorrect. The actual baud rate is:
    100k bits (10 10k packets)/5,184,000 sec. (1 day) = .02 baud
While the original assumption of no other activiy makes this seem like
a low cost method it is flawed. My system is intended to support a full
range of resources (and quite a few developed in-house) and it will have
more than this. Assuming that it was fully active we are actually looking
at paying for x bandwidth but only getting 1/10 x of useable bandwidth.
This is not economical to me when in the context of a SLIP (personaly I
would hesitate on a T1 or T3) feed. How many organizations can support a outlay of this amount? I suspect none.
Now on the packet count front:
Seems to me that if we are looking at a moderate to fully bandwidth limited
feed then what we are actually seeing is a small number of packets interspersed
with lots of other packets of all type. The simple re-order of the packets
on the out-going side should be sufficient since Mallet will have to look
at every packet anyway. With the above example we are looking at quite a signal to noise ratio (ie encrypted packet v all packets). I calculate it to
be on the order of-
     10k bits (1 packet)/ 74,649,600 bits (14.4k @ 24hrs) = 1.34E-4
This is a pretty small ratio and would stop most attacks unless one were using
a lot of Cray-acres...
As to the 24hr delay:
I understand and respect that some folks want instant access, I just see the
security as more important. By expanding the delay packet over 24hrs and not
a shorter period increases the amount of sheer data Mallet has to dig through.
I also suspect that if the sender can influence the delay, or if it is short,
they are looking at a reduced data set to analyze. I am attempting to use the
amount of information going out to hide the crypto-mail packets in a sheer
tide of info. Now for something completely different --
I will be using RX/V (A Unix SVR? clone) and was wondering if anyone has
used this OS? The users manual states it uses some form of DES for crypt().
Since I got the manuals today it may be a couple of days before I can really
answer in depth questions...

What I am looking at is a way to do binary searches in the key space w/ a function that would look at a test key and the result of running RSA on it and then tell me the relative magnitude between the real key and the

I would agree with you if we talk about a single P, however I suspect
that if one looks at a sequence of P's in a message that there might
be some analysis that could be done relating to the residuals. If you
take into account the regularity (periodicity?) of english text then
it seems to me that you could make some form of 1-1 mapping of the P's in a cypher-text to the plain-text. If you have any other thoughts on it would appreciate them...

As far as I am concerned if it could be done w/ a neural network, or
boolean algebra (course if no arithmetic ops no logic I guess), or
even a fuzzy algorithm (the original impetus to this line, I was looking
at "close enough" algorithms for a robot project I am in the middle of.
) would be ok by me. Seems to me though that if one looks at the results of the operation one could glean some sort of magnitude info out of the errors...

I am *NOT* talking about factoring anything. Perhaps this is why you are having a problem understanding what I am asking. I don't care what
the original key is, simply am I above it or below it. I don't see this
as a 1 to 1 with factoring large digit numbers.
I am less than convinced by this line of reasoning, if somebody has looked
at it why is there no mention in the texts on number theory or crypto that
I have access to? I am no expert and have not read all the texts in their
entirety, too busy building rockets and working on my own internet feed,
which is why I asked if anyone could point me to some prior work. I myself
find it hard to believe that such could be possible but one thing is certain
about life, it isn't.

You only found a single set of factors for your public key (ie 3,8 also work)
and if I had asked "is the number 6?" as my first question then I would have had it in 1 single guess which does *NOT* qualify as factoring your key.
the fact it is a subset of what I am talking about means that there are some
issues (and possibly an algorithm or two) that are outside of the purvue of
a discussion limited to simply factoring. The horizon has been expanded.

@_subject: Some observations on xMODn... 
I propose to clarify with a little mathematics as best I can what I
was, and am, asking...
To those this material appears obvious too please feel free to delete.
As I understand it MOD is a function which returns the remainder of a number (x) when divided by another number (n). As an example:
5mod3=2    ie 3 will go into 5 a single time and there will be a left over
              of 2.
11mod3=2   ie 3 will go into 11 a total of 3 times and there will be 2
              left over.
I propose there is a periodicity in the mod function:
n        0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12
nmod5    0  1  2  3  4  0  1  2  3  4  0   1   2
this can be simplified into a generic formula for a sequence:
       rem = (kn)+i  |big #          |big #
               |
i=0            |k=0
What this formual does is give you the sequence of any given remainder
for xmodn.
In a generic algorithm it appears as such:
     n = some number
     for k = 0 to "some really big number"
          for i = 0 to "some really big number"
               rem=(k*n)+i
          next i
     next k
           e
     c  = m (mod n)
      i    i
In my notation this reduces to:
     rem = (kn)+i  |          |
          |
 n=0      |i=0
What I am asking is that since the numbers we are looking at are  very large there should (to the way I am thinking at the moment) some means
of detecting a sequence of patterns of periodicity related to the difference
between the actual key and the key we just select randomly. Specificaly what I am asking for is some reference to some work in this area.
I don't know what it is called, it doesn't appear in any books that I have looked at.  Thanks for any help you may be able to provide...

I have to disagree. What I am asking is a binary question, not one of magnitude. I never care what the magnitude is. Don't want to know it.
Will give it away unopened if I do get it. If all you know is 1/0 then
you can't use it to factor the number. The other aspect of your method
is, yes it can give  you some of the factors, but it has no guarantee that you will find all of them. If your algorithm can'g guarantee it finds all of them every time then it can't be positively used to factor
To each their own (opinion). I am not breaking anything, I *am* asking for

No, again   it will allow you to find the secret key, it will not provide any information about the factors of that number. It might
be used for that but as you have pointed out, it takes a long time.
If I can take a cypher-text and look at the periodicity of the mod
function when several false keys are provided  I can narrow down
the guess through a binary search. I am going up, not down (ie finding
the factors which must be smaller than n). I am looking for n, not
its * factors.
You are asking the wrong question. I am asking, since I can't factor the
keys is there some periodicity in the mod function that I can attack.

I have made submission of a short text which details my thoughts relating
to a mod function attack. I am under no illusion about the complexity of mounting a factor attack.
I do see the mod function as the next natural hole to look at the algorithm
through. I can find no work relating to periodicities in the mod function
and it occurs to me that such relationships might point the way...

What you want is a Gunn diode oscillator w/ feedback.
Just remember to keep the temperature of the devices constant, semi-
conductors have a temperature dependancy which would allow them to monitor
the data and  possibly determine the gain of the amp and hence approx.
how much noise energy and sprectrum thereof it was contributing. Check
into Boltzmanns Constant applications to black body radiation.
I am not shure that a zener would produce any more  noise than a standard
diode. There might even be less noise because the design parameters are more tightly
controlled on a zener than standard diodes.
I actually like this idea a lot.                                  How about using the lines on the serial port for power?
How about a dongle? If they have this close access to your hardware then you have a more serious problem.
I would suggest getting some of virus source out there and take a look
at how the detectors watch system activity for fishy writes. Should not
be hard to load another TSR which watchdogs the system for any bogus
or un-authorized reads from the device. Just pass all system calls through
the TSR to access the device.

This is a bad idea, the computer it self will generate clocking noise which
will appear in the noise and destroy the randomness. The standard, and even
most high-end, recievers don't have the shielding to prevent this sort of
intrussion. Heck, that digital clock on your desk (and possibly your wrist if
close enough) will cause problems as well. Only up to a point. Past a certain point and the processes will start to
roll off their energy production.

In article <2u69cp$46q at asterix.uni-muenster.de> There are much tougher tests for random numbers than these, particularly if they are to be used for Monte Carlo where the numbers are used as m-tuples.  The tests you really need to make are the ones George Marsaglia calls the 'monkey test' and the 'birthday test', as well as the m-tuples test.  The first two are generalizations of the well known statistics problem of the monkey typing Shakespeare and of coincident birthdays in a group of people.  They are tough to pass. The problem as I see it is that 4-bit numbers do not generate much variability, so you will really need m-tuples of 4-tuples of these. This increases the chance that long range correlations will catch up to you when you least want them. I am sure George would be interested in this, however, since they have been looking at ways to incorporate physical noise that is truly random into the very sophisticated generators like the combination of lagged fibonacci with congruential.  The problem is that noise is seldom random enough, according to talks he has given.

the NSA itself believes it doesn't exist while in some basement office there is
a little super-cooled sugar cube sized widget cranking out numbers at a high rate of speed. As to the computing power of QM, when one considers that electrons shift orbits
instantly (otherwise photons would have to have momentum) and the distances are
so small the scaling factor is NOT strictly linear. I completely fail to understand the position that it is an extension of a SIMD
architecture, at that scale MIMD architectures will be the standard. My .02...

I am not shure that it has been demonstrated that a QM mechanis is necessarily
solely of a Turing architecture. When one considers the dependancy of electron
spin (for example) over distance (which happens to break the 'speed of light'
limit) there is sufficient reason (to my mind) to suspect that there will be
some additional funkyness going on here.
Also there is the potential to use neural networks at these levels (which are
not necessarily reducable to Turing models, the premise has never been proven)
which coupled w/ the speed of computation considerations leaves a lot to be
said for the security of all the existing 'time to crack' computations that I
have seen to date.
The bottem line is that this whole area is a unknown and if we persist in carrying unproven assumptions from the macro-world over into the QM model we
WILL be in for a nasty surprise.
I want to reiterate that I am not saying there is a threat, simply that what we
know about it know is not sufficiently strong enough in the 'proof' area to carry the weight of resolution some c-punks would like to assign it.

The whole problem w/ QM is that it is not, by its very nature, linear. Every
logical thought pattern you have needs to basicly be thrown away when you deal
with this real of physics. Consider an electron emitter that throws them out
180 degrees out. Because of the conservation of spin rules the electrons must
have opposite spins. However, when they are emitted you can't tell what their
individual spins are. However, when you measure one the other INSTANTLY orients
to the other value (ie +/- 1). This change happens faster than light (there
is no way a electron can emit a photon before you measure it unless it can
somehow jump into the future and know a priori when you measure it. Very nasty
problem w/ no explanation at this point. You can propose Tachyons and other
exotic particles but detecting them because of their lower limit velocity (ie
they must always travel faster than light) keeps us from measuring them. The point I am making is that the logical rules you use don't apply down here.

First off, EM fields are NOT QM. They do have some characteristics which 'bleed' over form the Quark level. Also since EM fields are made of
hardons and not leptons (which an electron is) may blow a hole in this
approach since leptons do not follow the same sort of charge conservation
rules as hadrons.
As to infinite precision and its non-presence....Beeep....wrong answer...
Electrons change state in zero time, this implies at least some form o f
infinite precision (otherwise how does the system know the difference between
zero and some small-o value?). I suspect this is another error based on
the implied (and incorrect) implication in this line of discussion that
hadrons and leptons use the same rules.

my brain to become stupid. I aplogize and agree that I got it bass-ackwards...
The point I was trying to make was that EM fields themselves are NOT QM, their
interaction w/ Hadrons ARE. Leptons themselves (which a photon and a electron
are) are not constrained by the same rules that limit Hadrons because Hadrons
are made from Quarks. Last time I checked Leptons don't care a flip about color, charm, etc. The uncertainties which arise in QM arise from the interactions of Hadrons. If a system does not involve a Hadron then it is pretty deterministic, sorta like a billiard ball. However, there has been some research recently (there was an article in SciAm, had a pool table on the
cover) where they were discussing chaos and the pooltable which brings into
doubt even the premise that macro-scale interactions are perfectly

Recently the staff at connected. has admitted that they have "invited" two FBI agents to roan that system. According to connected.staff these FBI agents are looking for "hackers phreaks" and people having copywritten programs.  I am pretty peaved about this, we don't know how long thev'e been here, what rights they have on the system, or much else. Just that they are here. Watching us.  Of course, I never use my account for illegal activities. Shit, I don't even do much illegal (except smoke a bit of pot) But I do not like the idea of giving up my rights against undue searches. This seems a reflection on the state of America today. This used to be a free country, but now there is a pig or FBI agent watching EVERYTHING you do. This is NOT the America described in the constitution. It's not a society of free, independent people. It is a dictatorship that must spy on it's own people in order to survive.
I am anxious to here what others that read these groups think about this.    Have A Nice Day     turmoil at hebron.connected.com

What a waste of time. There is no way that any reasonable person will accept
or support such an action. Wake up and smell the roses dude...
If you really want to fix the problem them how about reading the Constitution
and demanding that your EXISTING representatives uphold the sacred oath they
have sworn to uphold. Yes, this country has problem. No, they are nowhere near bad enough to render
the union. Get a clue.

Hi all,
I am not going to name names but I would like to address the comment that
several folks have made (or agreed with) that the US has gone 200 years w/o a major upheaval.
Maybe I am taking a alternate History than you folks but I believe the Civil War can be considered a major internal upheaval and it occured 4 score and 7 years (87 years) after the birth of our country. Since then
we have also had the civil rights upheaval (if you don't want to consider
deaths of folks like MLK major that is your business) in the late 50's and early 60's as well. Especially when you consider the political and social
turmoil that occured because of the Vietnam War.
What I find most interesting about this chronology is that the upheavals
occur approximately every hundred years since our founding. The fact that the present problems we are having w/ the administration recognizing and the general populace demaning their civil liberties/rights is apparently early
by approximately 70 years. Perhaps the present administration is really as
progressive as they claim...:)
Take care.

The only point here is that it doesn't address what causes the internal
strife. A populace that gets what it wants is obviously not going to be
full of strife. It seems to me, what needs to be addressed is the issue(s)
that are causing the strife. In the case of both the Civil War and the
Vietnam War it was economic in nature. In the Civil War it was the difference
that abolishing slavery would have caused to the plantation systems in teh
south and the industrial systems in the north. The Vietnam case is a little(!)
more complicated in that we may still be historicaly too close to it to get
a clear picture of the cause/effects. However, I do believe that the failure
of the industrial - military - political machine to provide the kinds of freedoms and inexpensive life that people were expecting may have played a major role in the events of the 60's.
I think we all agree the political - military complex is run by back scratching of herculian proportions. This may be a little difficult to analyze because
it is involved in both the cause and the result in such a major way.
Lesson 2 should be that the 'external' threat won't last forever and at some
point the real issues will blow up to such an extent that the poplace will
not be concerned about external events because they are so busy trying to
stay alive and make a living.

I have a hard time comparing any of these histricaly important but comparatively minor events to the half a million dead of the Civil War or the 50,000+ dead of Vietnam. Perhaps you have extended the
analogy a little too far?...
Considering that (taking my example) there have been only 2 'major' upheavals
since the founding fight we probably have way too few data points to draw
any real comparison about periodicity. I was making the comment more to
goad others to respond than to make any absolute statement about the periodicity. Also, one must be careful about how you defind 'major' upheaval.
This country has had lots of turmoil in its history and as long as that will
continue to be allowed I suspect we have a good chance of staying around as
a union. The reality is that while many of the turmoils have had national
import they were not at the time of the event of national range.

@_subject: Revisionist Reinterpretation 
The problem I have with this interpretationis that it overlooks, to me, a bigger point...
Mainly that these conflicts dealt with disagreements within the 'big G' and were not directly about the people - big G dichotomy that you refer to.
Personaly, I still feel that the people of this country are the true government
of this nation. We have representatives who are in a position where they
approach their office as a 'job' and not a sacred duty to every individual
they meet on the street every day. They see their oath to uphold the
Constitution as a minor point and not THE point.
Section 1401 and 1402 of the Crime Bill (aptly named since it is a crime) which
regard the seizure of private property for funding during a criminal
investigation. I go the Constitution and it says that if you take private property for public use you have to recompense the private owner. There is
no caveat dealing with whether it is a crime or not or whether it was used
in a crime. From my point of view if a 'official' takes your property and does not send you a check (you agreed a priori) for it then they have committed a crime that is in direct and clear violation of the Constitution.
All criminal seizure programs are clearly unconstitutional.

As to putting them all together, you do a diservice in my eyes. They did
not occur together and they certainly did not occur in the same social
milieu that the Civil War or the Vietnam War - Civil Disobedience did.
There were national events that effected every person. The events that
you refer to were local events that eventually effected every person
on a national scale. Slightly different animals.

A person has certain inalienable rights. The rights of teh majority in this
country are DEFINED by the Constitution. If the right or responsibility is not
SPECIFICALY detailed in that document  then the  Federal govt. does not have
that right, unless it is added as an amendment by the states. I oppose any
move by the majority to remove a possible action or belief system from the
individual that does not directly lead to the damage of a person or their property without their prior consent. Is that clear enough as to what I believe? Behind this view is an avowed As to the rose, call  it whatever is convenient...

I take it you don't take the comparison between the Roman circuses where
prisoners and other misfits (ie  Christians) were fed to the lions and and the Tutonic cirucses of the 30's and 40's (ie prison or relocation
camps) where the criminal and other misfits (ie Jewish) were fed to the
masochistic 'system' as comparable? The Warsaw Ghetto was not a form of
'circus' then?
I beg to differ. Both the Germans and the Romans held sway because of one
over-bearing fact, each controlled the best 'ass-kickers' around at the 'They' are the persons with money and influence and have also made it in their best interest to sustain the status quo. Just take a look at the Federal Reserve and how they manage the money in this country. Take a look
at the special interest political groups who make it their job to get
law-makers to look at it 'their' way.
Just exactly whose reality are we talking about ruling here? It seems to
me that when  talking about 'reality' and thought processes one has managed
to jump track in a major sort of way. The problem with this view is that
people do not analyze their choices the same way  you analyze some physical
problem like building a bridge. Christians definately look at the worl
around them in a different 'reality' then the way that a pantheist like
myself look at it. Consider, if you will, the difference in outlook of
a commen every  day occurance when viewed with  the concept of a  'ghost
in the machine' versus the purely mechanistic. I think you will find that
the most trivial things take  on very different appearances.
I can assure you that the folks out there will spend their money if it is
clear that they will make more of it in the long run. While it is true that
public monies are the easiest to spend because of its anonymity it is not
the only resource that is there. Consider under-the-table bribes and such.
I am afraid that if you ignore a control freak  you build the perfect environ for their growth. We are  not talking about roses here but rather
ideas, a decidedly different animal. Ideas can grow long after the original
thinker is gone. To ignore rather than confront and expose is the best
way possible to get what you  don't want.

I hate to burts your bubble but the masses of the Germany of the first
half of this century were no more unwashed or ignorant than today. The
Germany of that day was technologicaly sophisticated and education was
as wide spread as it is today. The vast majority of Germans could read
and do their cyphers (couldn't resist). The reason that Nazi success was
so great was because of two simple reasons. First they were so heavily
'victimized' by the peace treaty of WWI and secondly, because they saw
as a means to bypass this humiliation a return to the past, ie monarchy
and more ideal Germanic ideals. The Germans of that time thought they
were the best and the brightest and saw their predicimate as a humiliating
turn of events. These people got tires of everyone else blaiming them.
There is always a contender. In Italys case, the fascist were voted in. They did not 'take' the power
it was given to them.  A case can be made that Hindenburg in Germany gave
the power to Hitler (even though there was clearly a case  of threat imposed as a sweetner).
Germany, Italy, and Japan did not start out as military dictatorships. Both
Germany and Italy were relative demecrocies which did not take into account
a lot of their 'reality'. The powers that be were more interested in making
a 'ideal' society but not realizing that folks outside of their borders were
not going to play along. This is the exact same reason that the USSR failed
today. Competition.
Whose discipline? Exactly whose ideals and morality do we impose? A military
takeover is  NEVER a good thing. Implicit in its existance is the assumption
that people can't take care  of themselves. This particular dichotomy harks
back to the Enlightenment and the  Great Awakening. The real root of th e
problem is that we (as humans) have never devised a system which is Janus
faced in that  it recognizes that some people believe a strong central structure is good and those that disagree. To build a system which forces
either to compromise is wrong (either way you become what you hate the most).
What needs to be developed (and may be created as a fate acompli through
technology) is a system that lets 'control freaks' control and 'freedom
hounds' be free. In a certain way (though admittedly less than perfect)
the structure of  Internet is a good example. What you have is little
islands of freedom (ie each system) controlled very tightly by a commen
thread or standard of communication. Democracy in our country should work
the same way. There should be a very tightly controlled methodology for states to communicate and assist each other (ie Federal beurocracy) but
at the same time the individual states can do pretty much as they want
in their own borders.

You have obviously misinterpreted my statements intent. I do not hold that
any government can ignore economics. As a matter of fact, back there a ways
I alluded to the fall of most totalitarian regimes being linked to the
economics of open trade. As long as their is a market outside the totalitarian
keen there is a threat to its stability.
The Thousand Year Reich lasted less than a thousand years. I fail to see
how this is relevant to the discussion. I have not addressed in any manner
the concept that governments, totalitarian or otherwise, are guaranteed a endless bounty of curruption. All governments and structures fail.
As to legs, I assume you mean sufficient force to exist? The fist couple
that come to mind are China and Singapore. Neither are at this moment in any kind of collapse that is apparent. As to their being good examples from
your point of view, they have only existed since the end of WWII so they may
be too  young...
I fail to understand how 'public' the spectacle needs to be before it qualifies under your definition. Littery thousands of Christians were killed in the Arena because of failure to make their citizenship oaths.
I see this as the main point and why I feel justified in making the comparison between the Romans and the Germans (not to mention the fact
that Hitler was a big Roman freak..ever look at standards for Rome and for
Nazi Germany?).
How about the folks  involved in Whitewater? About The Pentagon Papers,
Air America, etc. Afraid? I am not afraid.
The US government does exactly that, they print money that has no backing
other than a few equations and then wonder why our economy cycles the way
it does. Economics is NOT like building a bridge. A bridge consists of aa few well known interactions and a basic understanding of the limits of the materials that you use. Economics is about trying to understand what happened
and why in a system revolving around the concepts of stock exchanges, banks
that are government backed, etc. In Oregon there is no longer any reference to 'pornography' in their laws.
In short their legal body has decided that such concepts are not applicable
to their society. The French have government enforced board which reviews
the language and decides on what is leglal or not; they also prohibit
the use of crypto by their citizens to a large extent. The Mormons build
a religion which strongly influences a government in Utah which effects all those peoples reality. In Shanghai, China it is against the law to own
a cat or dog without government permission. And in the process you become a control freak. You become what you most
hate (or want to avoid).

@_subject: Fast Modular Factorial? 
Just some thoughts...
If x < n then (n!)modx will always be 0. Since n! is simply the product of
the numbers 1...n and is always a integer product dividing by x simply
removes the factor m such that we have the product of 1...m-1,m+1...n.
If x>n and x is not a prime then the result will again always be 0 since
we can break x down into factors smaller than n and the previous argument
removes the various factors.
If x is prime and x>n then we will get a result that is non-zero.
Take care.

@_subject: Fast Modular Factorial? 
Will think on this. It seems to me that if you have a even number of prime
factors you can multiply them out and get an even number which you should
be able to remove easily. Do you mean that the number of prime factors is
greater than n! or greater than the number of prime factors of n!? Also,
consider that in the case of a x>>n you might actually run out of enough
factors smaller than n to remove. This is one case I didn't have time to
look at earlier. Right now I am looking at behaviour where x>(n)^1/2 and
also when x>(n!)^1/2.         6!= 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 = 720
        116 is > 6 so this does not disprove my assertion. The factor which
is left over, ie 29, is prime.
        27 is > 6 so this does not seem to disprove it either since in 6!
there is a 3 * 3 which removes one of the factors and you are left with 3
which is prime.
Consider x=n again, this means that n! is really n(n-1)! and the mod of
(n!)modx is equivalent to n(n-1)!modx which leave us with a multiplicitive
factor of (n-1)! and a remainder of 0.           One other point that may be irrelevant is that n! is always an even number.
The reason is that the very last multiplier is 2.

@_subject: (n!)modx ... 
Hi all,
In a reply late last week concerning large values of x and x having many
prime factors I made the comment that even pairs might be factored out
by multiplying them and then finding a different way to factor the product.
I as assuming that the product of two primes would not produce a product
which in general could not be factored a different way. This seems to be
in error. So far the vast majority of cases I have looked at have failed.
This leaves the problem of large values of x which have many prime factors
that appear either two or more times in n. At this point I don't see a way to use this relationship to further gain.
Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Something that might be relevant here is that relationship between energy and
lifetime for virtual particle generation. When a virtual particle is generated
it can have a random amount of energy. However, the larger the energy level
is the shorter its lifetime is. It is related to Plank's Constant in a relationship that I don't have on hand, but should be in most quantum texts.
