when you need to be home, may you find your way.
(i hate in quilting and knitting and sewing when the designs get all fancy just because they can). and it's so yummy
see you then!
ok, i'm off to knit...
but then again, we looove roadtrips.
i love the comments i get from all of you. and i love it (thanks, coco). cate was so happy she began yelling "let's give a hand to springtime! really, cate is also mexican, japanese, native american, swiss, and a lot more- a true american- so we actually have a lot of family history travelling to do, but i really love the romantic beauty of ireland, and have always been drawn to that part of the world. plus i really love corned beef.
we ate corned beef and cabbage with irish soda bread last night in preparation for the day of the irish. i found that amazing old shirt (we're big fans) at the thrift store for $1 and it's so soft. the ms craft dept was featured in an article, and their personal crafting projects were shown. soft and long lacy scarf light enough for spring, extra long for winter wrapping, elegant enough for church, cute enough for a tshirt...i really love this scarf pattern (gee can you tell?). really really happy.
and my wheels are turning with projects to put together for a locals knitting class. wooohoooo!" i love her style. and a delicious coke.
4. i don't worry about a little "creative clutter" in cate's room. i say, a good dress up/ barbie mess day better than watching tv all afternoon, right? pretty soon i will just put my 'kerchief on again and go to town. (yes, that is what cate's room looks like again, just over a month after the big clean. i tell you, i'm fighting a losing battle with that girl). does that answer your question, mary? i hope it helps! wink.
