Drafts of Ms. Jordon's testimony reveal that the Commission has backed
off its initial proposal to require a national id card. Rather, the
Commission will recommend a pilot program for the 5 states "most harmed
by illegal immigration." It appears that this "pilot program" is only an
attempt to limit initial opposition to the proposal with a
future plan to implement it to other states as possible. In fact, when
the national id proposal was first floated, the plan was to implement
it step by step. Assuming that this will include Florida, California

  _____________________________________________________________
For Release:

            Group Seeks Release of FBI Wiretap Data,       Calls Proposed Surveillance Legislation Unnecessary
     Washington, DC:  A leading privacy rights group today sued the Federal Bureau of Investigation to force the release of documents the FBI claims support its campaign for new wiretap legislation.  The documents were cited by FBI Director Louis Freeh during testimony before Congress and in a speech to an influential legal organization but have never been released to the public.
     The lawsuit was filed as proposed legislation which would mandate technological changes long sought by the FBI was scheduled to be introduced in Congress.       The case was brought in federal district court by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a public interest research organization that has closely monitored the Bureau's efforts to mandate the design of the nation's telecommunications infrastructure to facilitate wiretapping.  An earlier EPIC lawsuit revealed that FBI field offices had reported no difficulties conducting wiretaps as a result of new digital communications technology, in apparent contradiction of frequent Bureau claims.
     At issue are two internal FBI surveys that the FBI Director has cited as evidence that new telephone systems interfere with law enforcement investigations.  During Congressional testimony on March 18, Director Freeh described "a 1993 informal survey which the FBI did with respect to state and local law enforcement authorities."   According to Freeh, the survey describes the problems such agencies had encountered in executing court orders for electronic surveillance.  On May 19 the FBI Director delivered a speech before the American Law Institute in Washington, DC.  In his prepared remarks, Freeh stated that "[w]ithin the last month, the FBI conducted an informal survey of federal and local law enforcement regarding recent technological problems which revealed over 180 instances where law enforcement was precluded from implementing or fully implementing court [wiretap] orders."
     According to David L. Sobel, EPIC's Legal Counsel, the FBI has not yet demonstrated a need for the sweeping new legislation that it seeks.  "The Bureau has never presented a convincing case that its wiretapping capabilities are threatened.  Yet it seeks to redesign the information infrastructure at an astronomical cost to the taxpayers."  The nation's telephone companies have consistently stated that there have been no cases in which the needs of law enforcement have not been met.
     EPIC is a project of the Fund for Constitutional Government and Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility.
           FBI Director Freeh's Recent Conflicting    Statements on the Need for Digital Telephony Legislation
Speech before the Executives' Club of Chicago, February 17:
   Development of technology is moving so rapidly that several
   hundred court-authorized surveillances already have been
   prevented by new technological impediments with advanced
   communications equipment.
               *               *               *
Testimony before Congress on March 18:
   SEN. LEAHY: Have you had any -- for example, digital telephony,
   have you had any instances where you've had a court order for a
   wiretap  that couldn't be executed because of digital
   telephony?
   MR. FREEH: We've had problems just short of that.  And I was
   going to continue with my statement, but I won't now because
   I'd actually rather answer questions than read. We have
   instances of 91 cases -- this was based on a 1993 informal
   survey which the FBI did with respect to state and local law
   enforcement authorities.  I can break that down for you.
               *               *               *
Newsday interview on May 16:
   We've determined about 81 different instances around the
   country where we were not able to execute a court-authorized
   electronic surveillance order because of lack of access to that
   particular system - a digital switch, a digital loop or some
   blocking technology which we didn't have to deal with four or
   five years ago.
               *               *               *
Speech before the American Law Institute on May 19:
   Within the last month, the FBI conducted an informal survey of
   federal and local law enforcement regarding recent techno-
   logical problems which revealed over 180 instances where law
   enforcement was precluded from implementing or fully
   implementing court orders [for electronic surveillance].

@_subject: EPIC Statement on FBI Wiretap Bill 
*DISTRIBUTE WIDELY*
           EPIC Statement on Digital Telephony Wiretap Bill      The digital telephony bill recently introduced in Congress is the
culmination of a process that began more than two years ago, when the
Federal Bureau of Investigation first sought legislation to ensure its
ability to conduct electronic surveillance through mandated design
changes in the nation's information infrastructure.  We have monitored
that process closely and have scrutinized the FBI's claims that
remedial legislation is necessary.  We have sponsored conferences at
which the need for legislation was debated with the participation of
the law enforcement community, the telecommunications industry and
privacy advocates.  We have sought the disclosure of all relevant
information through a series of requests under the Freedom of
Information Act.  Having thus examined the issue, EPIC remains
unconvinced of the necessity or advisability of the pending bill.
     As a threshold matter, we do not believe that a compelling case
has been made that new communications technologies hamper the ability
of law enforcement agencies to execute court orders for electronic
surveillance. For more than two years, we have sought the public
disclosure of any FBI records that might document such a problem.  To
date, no such documentation has been released.  Without public scrutiny
of factual information on the nature and extent of the alleged
technological impediments to surveillance, the FBI's claims remain
anecdotal and speculative.  Indeed, the telecommunications industry
has consistently maintained that it is unaware of any instances in
which a communications carrier has been unable to comply with law
enforcement's requirements.  Under these circumstances, the nation
should not embark upon a costly and potentially dangerous re-design of
its telecommunications network solely to protect the viability of fewer
than 1000 annual surveillances against wholly speculative impediments.
     We also believe that the proposed legislation would establish a
dangerous precedent for the future.  While the FBI claims that the
legislation would not enhance its surveillance powers beyond those
contained in existing law, the pending bill represents a fundamental
change in the law's approach to electronic surveillance and police
powers generally.  The legislation would, for the first time, mandate
that our means of communications must be designed to facilitate
government interception.  While we as a society have always recognized
law enforcement's need to obtain investigative information upon
presentation of a judicial warrant, we have never accepted the notion
that the success of such a search must be guaranteed.  By mandating the
success of police searches through the re-design of the telephone
network, the proposed legislation breaks troubling new ground.  The
principle underlying the bill could easily be applied to all emerging
information technologies and be incorporated into the design of the
National Information Infrastructure.  It could also lead to the
prohibition of encryption techniques other than government-designed
"key escrow" or "Clipper" type systems.
     In short, EPIC believes that the proposed digital telephony bill
raises substantial civil liberties and privacy concerns.  The present
need for the legislation has not been established and its future
implications are frightening.  We therefore call upon all concerned
individuals and organizations to express their views on the legislation
to their Congressional representatives.  We also urge you to contact
Rep. Jack Brooks, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, to share
your opinions:

@_subject: New National ID Card Proposal 
CBS Evening News just reported that Clinton has "tenatively signed off"
on a National ID card recommended to him by a commission on immigration reform. The obstensive reason for the card is for employment and immigration. Each card will contain a name, photo, mag stripe with info and a "verified SSN." It was supported by Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming, a long-time supporter of id cards. Gov. Pete Wilson of California has apparently offered to make California a test-bed for the proposal.  The proposal was opposed by Xavier Beccera, a Congressman from California.  A previous effort to impose a national id card was rejected by Congress in 1986.
EPIC is working with Privacy International to investigate this report. PI has led successful campaigns aginst national id cards in Australia, New Zealand, and the Phillipines. In Australia, the PI-led campaign led to the dissolution of both houses of the federal Parliament in 1987 after hundrends of thousands marched in protest. The Australian campaign brought together groups from all parts of the political spectrum from the Communist Party to the Libertarian Alliance, farmers and conservation groups, rock stars, academics, large businesses such as banks and mining corporations, but the overwhelming support came from the public who created the biggest civil protest in Australian history.

6/12:EDITORIAL: A CLOSER LOOK ON WIRETAPPING
c.1994 N.Y. Times News Service
The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, June 12:
The government's ability to tap private phone calls is under
siege. Newly developed encryption systems allow callers to
mathematically scramble their messages so that no one, including
the government, can eavesdrop. And digital technology - from
cellular phones to call-forwarding - makes wiretapping
increasingly difficult.
The Clinton administration is running scared and proposes two
fixes, neither satisfactory. Government needs to wiretap under
legally restricted circumstances. Though used sparingly during the
1980s (1,000 a year), taps helped convict more than 20,000 felons.
But before tampering with existing arrangements, the
administration must show that its proposals are workable and will
not trample on existing rights to conduct private phone
conversations. So far it has cleared neither hurdle.
To overcome private encryption, the administration will encourage
people who plan to encode calls to buy phones with a
government-designed encryption system, known as Clipper, built
into the hardware; the government, with judicial approval, would
be able to unscramble the messages. But the policy is unlikely to
work because Clipper phones are unlikely to dominate the market -
leaving Washington the choice of admitting defeat or turning Big
Brotherish and outlawing non-Clipper encryption systems.
To overcome technological barriers, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation proposes a second fix: legislation that would
require phone companies to adopt only those technologies that
preserve the government's ability to wiretap. The problem with
this plan is that its sweeping prohibitions threaten to stop
telecommunication innovations before anyone calculates the
The administration would like to begin by encouraging the IRS and
other agencies to buy Clipper phones; it might then require
private parties that wish to send the government encoded messages
to do so only with Clipper phones. The government hopes that in
time Clipper phones would become standard equipment everywhere.
Callers using other encryption systems would have to plan ahead
and acquire compatible software, a big task for run-of-the-mill
But many experts predict that Clipper phones will not become
standard. There are easy-to-use encryption systems that require no
special phones, no shared secret passwords. And, unlike Clipper,
they cannot be intercepted by the government. Because un-tappable
systems will prove attractive the private market is likely to make
them as readily available as Clipper.
Clipper uses a secret mathematical formula for scrambling calls.
But there are flaws in the formula, as The New York Times recently
revealed. The danger with secret formulas is that someone in or
outside government could discover a new flaw and exploit it to tap
encoded calls without a court order.
Another bad feature concerns the passwords (actually, numbers) the
government needs to unscramble calls from Clipper phones. The
passwords would be held in escrow by two federal agencies (and
released to the FBI upon presentation of a court order). A better
way to protect against government abuse would be to entrust
passwords to the courts or designated non-government
The FBI's fix - requiring phone companies to build easily tappable
systems - raises the unsettling image of forcing a phone company
to design its "home" so that the police can easily enter. And the
fix is unnecessarily blunt. The government could compel phone
companies to solve specific problems, like making call-forwarding
The administration is right to worry about its ability to tap
phones for legitimate law enforcement. So far, its suggestions for
safeguarding that ability seem unworkable and potentially

                 ENCRYPTION POLICY ENDANGERS U.S.               COMPETITIVENESS IN GLOBAL MARKETPLACE
       For some time now, a debate has been raging in the media   and in the halls of Congress over the Administration's   intention to require U.S. corporations to use and market the   Clipper Chip, an encryption device developed in secret by the   National Security Agency.
       The Clipper Chip will provide industry and others with   the ability to encode telephone and computer communications.    The use of the Clipper Chip as the U.S. encryption standard   is a concept promoted by both the intelligence and law   enforcement communities because it is designed with a back   door to make it relatively easy for these agencies to listen   in on these communications.
       The law enforcement and intelligence communities have a   legitimate concern that advances in technology will make   their jobs more difficult.  But the issue here is whether   attempts to restrict the development, use and export of   encryption amounts to closing the barn door after the horse   has already escaped.
       The notion that we can limit encryption is just plain   fanciful.  Encryption technology is available worldwide --   and will become more available as time goes on.
       First, generally available software with encryption   capabilities is sold within the U.S. at thousands of retail   outlets, by mail, even, over the phone.  These programs may   be transferred abroad in minutes by anyone using a public   telephone line and a computer modem.
       Second, it is estimated that over 200 products from    some 22 countries -- including Great Britain, France,   Germany, Russia, Japan, India, and South Africa -- use some   form of the encryption that the Government currently   prohibits U.S. companies from exporting.  According to the   May 16, 1994 issue of _Fortune_, not only are U.S. companies   willing to purchase foreign encryption devices, American   producers of encrypted software are also moving production   overseas to escape the current export controls.
       Third, encryption techniques and technology are well   understood throughout the world.  Encryption is routinely   taught in computer science programs.  Text books explain the   underlying encryption technology.  International   organizations have published protocols for implementing high   level encryption.  Actual implementations of encryption --   programs ready to use by even computer novices -- are on the   Internet.
       The only result of continued U.S. export controls is     to threaten the continued preeminence of America's computer   software and hardware companies in world markets.  These   restrictive policies jeopardize the health of American   companies, and the jobs and revenues they generate.
       I support, therefore, the immediate revision of current   export controls over encryption devices to comport with the   reality of worldwide encryption availability.
       I believe law enforcement and the intelligence community   would be better served by finding real, and targeted ways to   deal with international terrorists and criminals rather than   promoting scattershot policies, which restrict American   industries' ability to design, produce and market technology.
       Now -- more than ever -- we cannot afford to harm our   economic competitiveness and justify it in the name of   national security.

FOR RELEASE:  August 16, 1995, 2:00 p.m. EST
CONTACT: David Sobel (202) 544-9240
               FBI FILES: CLIPPER MUST BE MANDATORY
that key federal agencies concluded more than two years ago that the "Clipper Chip" encryption initiative will only succeed if alternative security techniques are outlawed.  The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) obtained the documents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation under the Freedom of Information Act.  EPIC, a non-profit research group, received hundreds of pages of material from FBI files concerning Clipper and with frequent Administration claims that use of Clipper technology will remain "voluntary."  Critics of the government's initiative, including EPIC, have long maintained that the Clipper "key-escrow encryption" technique would only serve its stated purpose if made mandatory.  According to the FBI documents, that view is shared by the Bureau, the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Department of Justice (DOJ).
Applications and Potential Solutions," and sent to the National Security Council in February 1993, the FBI, NSA and DOJ concluded      Technical solutions, such as they are, will only work if      they are incorporated into *all* encryption products.       To ensure that this occurs, legislation mandating the      use of Government-approved encryption products or      adherence to Government encryption criteria is required.
Telecommunications Technologies on Law Enforcement" observes that "[a]lthough the export of encryption products by the United States is controlled, domestic use is not regulated."  The report concludes that "a national policy embodied in legislation is needed."  Such a policy, according to the FBI, must ensure "real-
time decryption by law enforcement" and "prohibit[] cryptography that cannot meet the Government standard."
assurances that the government does not intend to prohibit the use of non-escrowed encryption.  Testifying before a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on May 3, 1994, Assistant Attorney General Jo Ann Harris asserted that:
     As the Administration has made clear on a number of      occasions, the key-escrow encryption initiative is a      voluntary one; we have absolutely no intention of      mandating private use of a particular kind of      cryptography, nor of criminalizing the private use of      certain kinds of cryptography.
 	According to EPIC Legal Counsel David Sobel, the newly-
disclosed information "demonstrates that the architects of the Clipper program -- NSA and the FBI -- have always recognized that key-escrow must eventually be mandated.  As privacy advocates and industry have always said, Clipper does nothing for law enforcement unless the alternatives are outlawed."

The White House and NIST annouced today that they were planning to hold two
open meetings next month to develop standards for "acceptable" software key
escrow.  The standards will then be made into a FIPS. The programs cannot
have keys larger than 64 bits.
Its great to see that it only took them 18 months (since Feb. 94) to come
up with a call for public meetings for something that nobody really wants
anyway, expcept for the officals who plan to make it mandatory by slipping
it through bit by bit and a couple of vendors.  (sorry, sarcasm mode

It seems more likely that the opposite will occur: Clinton has been pandering
for the police vote so strongly that he's more likely to come up with more
draconian proposals to curry their favor.

EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE:                  NIST 95-24
3 p.m. EDT, Thursday, Aug. 17, 1995
Contact:  Anne Enright Shepherd         COMMERCE'S NIST ANNOUNCES
          (301) 975-4858                PROCESS FOR DIALOGUE ON
                                        KEY ESCROW ISSUES
     Furthering the Administration's commitment to defining a
workable key escrow encryption strategy that would satisfy
government and be acceptable to business and private users of
cryptography, the Commerce Department's National Institute of
Standards and Technology announced today renewed dialogue on key
escrow issues.
     A Sept. 6-7 workshop will convene industry and government
officials to discuss key escrow issues, including proposed
liberalization of export control procedures for key escrow
software products with key lengths up to 64 bits, which would
benefit software manufacturers interested in building secure
encryption products that can be used both domestically and
     Key escrow encryption is part of the Administration's
initiative to promote the use of strong techniques to protect the
privacy of data and voice transmissions by companies, government
agencies and others without compromising the government's ability
to carry out lawful wiretaps.
     In a July 1994 letter to former Rep. Maria Cantwell, Vice
President Gore said that the government would work on developing
exportable key escrow encryption systems that would allow escrow
agents outside the government, not rely on classified algorithms,
be implementable in hardware or software, and meet the needs of
industry as well as law enforcement and national security.  Since
that time, discussions with industry have provided valuable
guidance to the Administration in the development of this policy.
For example, many companies are interested in using a corporate
key escrow system to ensure reliable back-up access to encrypted
information, and the renewed commitment should foster the
development of such services.
     Consideration of additional implementations of key escrow
comes in response to concerns expressed by software industry
representatives that the Administration's key escrow policies did
not provide for a software implementation of key escrow and in
light of the needs of federal agencies for commercial encryption
products in hardware and software to protect unclassified
information on computer and data networks.
     Officials also announced a second workshop at which industry
is invited to help develop additional Federal Information
Processing Standards for key escrow encryption, specifically to
include software implementations.  This standards activity would
provide federal government agencies with wider choices among
approved key escrow encryption products using either hardware or
software.  Federal Information Processing Standards provide
guidance to agencies of the federal government in their
procurement and use of computer systems and equipment.
     Industry representatives and others interested in joining
this standards-development effort are invited to a key escrow
standards exploratory workshop on Sept. 15 in Gaithersburg, Md.
This workshop is an outgrowth of last year's meetings in which
government and industry officials discussed possible technical
approaches to software key escrow encryption.
     The Escrowed Encryption Standard, a Federal Information
Processing Standard for use by federal agencies and available for
use by others, specifies use of a Key Escrow chip (once referred
to as "Clipper chip") to provide strong encryption protection for
sensitive but unclassified voice, fax and modem communications
over telephone lines.  Currently, this hardware-based standard is
the only FIPS-approved key escrow technique.  NIST officials
anticipate proposing a revision to the Escrowed Encryption
Standard to allow it to cover electronic data transmitted over
computer networks.  Under this revised federal standard, the
Capstone chip and other hardware-based key escrow techniques
developed for use in protecting such electronic data also will be
approved for use by federal agencies.
     As a non-regulatory agency of the Commerce Department's
Technology Administration, NIST promotes U.S. economic growth by
working with industry to develop and apply technology,
measurements and standards.

MEMORANDUM FOR Registrants for the Sept. 6-7, 1995
               Key Escrow Issues Meeting
Attached for your information are two discussion papers for the
upcoming September 6-7, 1995 Key Escrow Issues Meeting to be held
at NIST.  If you have any questions on this material, you may
reach me on 301-975-3696.  I look forward to seeing you in September.                      ------------------------
Key Escrow Issues Meeting, September 6-7, 1995
Discussion Paper                       Issues -- Export of                  Software Key Escrowed Encryption
On August 17, 1995, the Administration announced its proposal to
permit the ready export of software encryption provided that the
products use algorithms with key space that does not exceed 64
bits and the key(s) required to decrypt messages/files are
escrowed with approved escrow agents.  Under the proposal,
products will be reviewed to verify that they satisfy the
criteria and, if so, they will be transferred to the Commodity
Control List administered by the Department of Commerce where the
products can be exported under a general license (in much the
same way that 40-bit RC2/RC4 encryption is licensed today).  We are working toward creating broadly stated criteria that are
in the nature of performance specifications.  To meet these
criteria, encryption products will need to implement key escrow
mechanisms that cannot be readily altered or bypassed so as to
defeat the purposes of key escrowing.  The criteria, when finalized and published, will state the
objectives, but not the exact technical method(s), by which those
objectives are satisfied.  This is to provide software publishers
the flexibility to design methods for meeting our stated
objectives in a manner that is compatible with the design of
their products.  There are, therefore, a number of questions we
must work together to answer in order to draft effective
criteria.  These questions are:  *    Avoiding multiple encryption -- How can the product be
     designed so as to prevent doubling (or tripling, etc.) the
     key space of the algorithm? *    Disabling the key escrow mechanism -- How can products be
     made resistant to alteration that would disable or
     circumvent the key escrow mechanism?  How can the "static
     patch" problem be avoided?  How can this be tested?
*    Access to escrow information -- What mechanisms must be
     designed into encryption products to allow authorized access
     to escrowed keys?  This likely includes the identity of the
     key escrow agent(s) and a serial number for the key escrow
     agent to use to identify the key(s)/component(s) necessary
     to decrypt the message.  What other information will be
     necessary to be provided to the escrow agent to identify the
     necessary key(s)/component(s)?  Are there other comparable
     viable approaches?
*    Non-escrowed use -- How can products be made so that they do
     not function with non-escrowed products (or tampered
     escrowed products)?  How can this be tested?
*    Limiting surveillance -- How can products be designed so
     that information both sent and received by the user can be
     decrypted without release of keys of other users?
*    Practical Key Access -- How can mechanisms be designed so
     that repeated involvement of escrow agents is not required
     for decryption for multiple files/messages during the
     specified access period?
*    Assurance that keys are escrowed -- How can it be assured
     that key escrow products are indeed satisfactorily escrowed?      For example, products could be required to be escrowed at
     time of manufacture or be made inoperable until properly
     escrowed.
*    Ability to re-escrow keys -- How can products be designed so
     that new keys can be escrowed at the user's discretion with
     a U.S. Government approved escrow agent?
*    Certified escrow agents -- Can products be designed so that
     only escrow agents certified by the U.S. government
     (domestic, or under suitable arrangements, foreign) are
     utilized?  What should be the criteria for an acceptable
     U.S. escrow agent?                          --------------
With your input, we are hopeful that this effort will lead to
definitive criteria, which will facilitate the development of
exportable products and help minimize the time required to obtain
export licenses.  The Administration seeks to finalize such
criteria and make formal conforming modifications to the export
regulations before the end of 1995.  Note:  These issues will be discussed at the Key Escrow Issues
Meeting to be held September 6-7, 1995 (9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.) at
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg,
Maryland).  The meeting will be open to the public, although
seating is limited.  Advance registration is requested, please

Key Escrow Issues Meeting, September 6-7, 1995
Discussion Paper                       Discussion Issues:           Desirable Characteristics for Key Escrow Agents
In the government's recent announcement of its intent to allow
the export of 64-bit software key escrow encryption products, one
stipulation was that the keys would be escrowed with an approved
key escrow agent.(*1)  Exactly what qualifications/considerations
are appropriate for approval as a key escrow agent have not been
defined.  Some of the issues which need to be discussed and
resolved include the following:
*    What kinds of organizations should be excluded from
     consideration as approved key escrow agents? *    What sort of legal agreement between the government and the
     key escrow agent is necessary to stipulate the
     responsibilities of the agent?  Should this include the
     terms and conditions under which release of a key is
     required?  *    How will liability for unauthorized release of key be
     handled?
*    Should, for example, intentionally misreleasing or
     destroying a key be criminalized?  Should this include other
     actions?                           *    How can the government's needs for confidentiality of key
     release be handled?
*    Should approval of key escrow agents be tied to a public key
     infrastructure (for digital signatures and other purposes)? *    What procedures need to be developed for the storage and
     safeguarding of keys?
*    What are the acceptable performance criteria (e.g., around-
     the-clock availability, accessibility, reliability, etc.)
     for approved key escrow agents?
*    Under what circumstances will key escrow agents in foreign
     countries be approved?
*    What process will be used to approve escrow agents?      Costs/who pays?
(*1)  "Approved," for the purposes of this discussion, means that
the government (or its agent) has formally granted permission for
an organization to hold keys for exportable encryption products.
Note:  These issues will be discussed at the Key Escrow Issues Meeting to be
held September 6-7,
1995 (9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (Gaithersburg,

MEDIA RELEASE

PRIVACY WATCHDOG OUTS BIG BROTHER COMPANIES New report uncovers a massive international surveillance trade
funded by the arms industry and led by the UK
On Monday 4 December, Privacy International will publish Big
Brother Incorporated, a 150 page report which investigates the
global trade in repressive surveillance technologies. The report, to
be published on several Web sites on the Internet,  shows how
technology companies in Europe and North America provide the
surveillance infrastructure for the secret police and military
authorities in such countries as China, Indonesia, Nigeria, Angola,
Rwanda and Guatemala
The reports primary concern is the flow of sophisticated
computer-based technology from developed countries to
developing countries  - and particularly to non-democratic regimes.
The report demonstrates how these companies have strengthened
the lethal authority of the world's most dangerous regimes.
The report lists the companies, their directors, products and exports.
In each case, source material is meticulously cited. Privacy International is publishing the report in digital form in
several sites on the Internet to ensure its accessability by interested
parties anywhere in the world.
Surveillance technologies are defined as technologies which can
monitor, track and assess the movements, activities and
communications of individuals.  More than 80 British companies are
involved, making the UK the world leader in this field. Other
countries, in order of significance, are the United States, France,
Israel, the Netherlands and Germany.
_Big Brother Incorporated_ is the first investigation ever conducted
into this trade.  Privacy International intends to update the report
from time to time using trade fair documents and leaked information
from whistleblowers.
The surveillance trade is almost indistinguishable from the arms
trade. More than seventy per cent of companies manufacturing and
exporting surveillance technology also export arms, chemical
weapons, or military hardware.  Surveillance is a crucial element
for the maintenance of any  non-democratic infrastructure, and is an
important activity in the pursuit of intelligence and political control.
Many countries in transition to democracy also rely heavily on
surveillance to satisfy the demands of police and military. The
technology described in the report makes possible mass
surveillance of populations.  In the past, regimes relied on targeted
Much of this technology is used to track the activities of dissidents,
human rights activists, journalists, student leaders, minorities, trade
union leaders, and political opponents. It is also useful for
monitoring larger sectors of the population. With this technology,
the financial transactions, communications activity and geographic
movements of millions of people can be captured, analysed and
transmitted cheaply and efficiently.
Western surveillance technology is providing invaluable support to
military and totalitarian authorities throughout the world.  One
British computer firm provided the technological infrastructure to
establish the South African automated Passbook system, upon
which much of the functioning of the Apartheid regime  British
surveillance cameras were used in Tianamen Square against the
pro-democracy demonstrators.  In the 1980s,  an Israeli company
developed and exported the technology for the computerised death
list used by the Guatemalan police. Two British companies
routinely provide the Chinese authorities with bugging equipment
and telephone tapping devices. organisation.  It brings together privacy experts, human rights advocates and
technology experts in more than 40 countries, and works toward the goal of
promoting privacy issues worldwide.  The organisation acts as an impartial
on surveillance activities by governments and corporations.

@_subject: EPIC Files Suit to Obtain C 
Per various people's requests, I'm only putting this piece on the list. You
can get the rest of the newsletter at [2] EPIC Files Suit to Obtain Gov't Crypto Report
EPIC filed suit on December 4 against the U.S. Department of Commerce
under the Freedom of Information Act to force the release of a survey
conducted by the Department on the foreign availability of encryption
software. According to Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown the study has been completed and is being held up by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National Security Agency, the two agencies most strongly pushing the Mandatory Key Escrow (MKE) Observers believe that the report will confirm the existence of a
substantial amount of commercial and free software available from
non-U.S. companies worldwide. An ongoing survey conducted by the
Software Publishers Association has found over 450 products from 27
countries. Of those products, 179 use the U.S. Data Encryption Standard
(DES). The existence of a substantial amount of commercial software
overseas cuts against arguments that export controls on encryption
software should be maintained.
The report was created after Congress decided not to pass legislation
last year that would have relaxed export controls on encryption. The legislation would have required the Department of Commerce to complete the foreign availability report by April 1995. Although the legislation was not enacted, the Commerce Department nonetheless agreed to conduct the study.
More information on U.S. Cryptography Policy is available at:    In a related development EPIC Legal Counsel David Sobel appeared before
the National Institute of Standards and Technology on December 5th to offer comments on NIST's "Draft Export for Key Escrow Encryption". Sobel
blasted the latest proposal for Mandatory Key Escrow (MKE) and said that the administration continues to ignore the interests of the public.  EPIC also put forward seven recommendations to reform national cryptography policy.  The recommendations follow from a presentation to
the National Research Council earlier this year.  The EPIC Statement on the NIST standard and the  EPIC proposal for cryptography policy is available at:

@_subject: A Chronology on crypto bans 
Someone asked why is there such a flurry recently on banning crypto in
recent months. This is not a recent issue. There have been almost non-stop
attempts for the last 15 years.
I've been finishing up this chapter in the book Bruce Schneier and I are
writing on crypto battles. Every so often a new FOIA document floats in
from some request I made 3-4 years ago hat makes me have to revise it
again. Here
s a small chronology based on the chapter.
Attempts to ban encprytion 1977-1995
1977-1980 NSA Director Inman calls crypto born secret. Should be restricted.
Attempts to use Invention Secrecy Act of 1951 to patent inventions by
academic researchers. Attempts to use export control laws to limit
scientific discussion.
NSA Threates NSF over grants for crypto studies.
1981 American Council on Education committee recommends voluntary
submissions of cryto papers to NSA
1984 National Security Decision Directive 145. Gave NSA authority over all
govt crypto and computer security development.
1986 NSTISSP. Attempted to extend NSDD-145 to private sector. USe to
justify visits to LEXIS/NEXIS, Dialog, public libraries etc.
1987 Congress passes Computer Security Act. Gives crypto authority to NIST.
1989 NIST signs MOU with NSA giving back authority to NSA.  NIST starts
development of new public key system to do both signatures and key
1990 After pressure by NSA. NIST adopts El Gamal for signatures only. NSA
secreatly designs "algorithm on a chip" for key exchange. FBI, NSA and NIST
also begin "National Cryptgraphic Review".
1991 FBI asks Senator Joseph Biden to introduce "Sense of Congress" to
recommend backdoors in all encpryption, telephone systems. Provision
removed after public outcry. Later evolves into digital telephony proposal.
October 1991, NSA, FBI, CIA meet to discuss possible legislation on
1992 NIST memo - "FBI working on draft legislation to control and liscense
all cryptography"
1993 Clipper Proposal introduced. Interagency working group formed by
Presidential Review Directive 27. According to NSA memo on IWG "FBI
proposed legislation to authorize the FCC to regulate common carriers, PBX
operators, and  manufacturers of encryption devices available for use in
the US  to ensure such systems and devices are compatable with law
enforcement electronic surveillance interests....the interagency working
group revied proposed legislation and concluded that ....legislation to
authorize regulation of encryption product manufacturers would be
considerably more difficult [than passing the digital telephone proposal]
and required further study." 6 options were discussed including prohobiting
all other encprytion besides Clipper. The other five have been classified
"top secret".

Hi bruce, Hows it going? I'm back from DK and the UK. I understand you're
just coming back from JP (wow what world travelers we are!).
have you heard from Sutherland? Do we have a title? page length? It seems
to me that we should take out some of the clipper stuff and put in more on
CKE since thats pretty hopt at the moment and will further distinguish us
from Hoffman's book.
We have also moved upto 56kb FR here in the office. Are you still
interested in a home page here? Or do you have one we can link to?

Dear Chairman Burns:
associations, we are writing to support your efforts, and the efforts of the other cosponsors of the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act, to remove unnecessarily restrictive controls on the export of encryption technology.  The Encrypted Communications Privacy Act sets out the minimum changes that are necessary to the current export controls on  encryption technology.  However, we believe that the inclusion of issues that are tangential to export, such as key escrow and encryption in domestic criminal activities, is not necessary.  The relaxation of export controls is of great economic importance to industry and users, and should not become entangled in more controversial matters.
the interests of the United States in three ways: they handicap American producers of software & hardware, prevent the development of a secure information infrastructure, and limit the ability of Americans using new online services to protect their privacy.  The proposed legislation will help mitigate all of these problems, though more will need to be done to assure continued US leadership in this important hi-tech sector.
national security into the commercial sphere. Current policies, as well as the policy-making processes, should reflect this new reality. The legislation takes a necessary first step in shifting authority to the Commerce Department and removing restrictions on certain encryption products.  Future liberalization of export controls will allow Americans to excel in this market.
the creation of a Global Information Infrastructure sufficiently secure to provide seamless connectivity to customers previously unreachable by American companies.   The United States is a leader in Internet commerce.  However, Internet commerce requires cryptography.  Thus American systems have been hindered by cold-war restraints on the necessary cryptography as these systems have moved from the laboratory to the marketplace.  This legislation would open the market to secure, private, ubiquitous electronic commerce.  The cost of not opening the market may include the loss of leadership in computer security technologies, just at the time when Internet users around the world will need good security to launch commercial applications.
export regulations must be based on analysis of financial and commercial requirements and opportunities, not simply on the views of experts in national security cryptography. Therefore, we urge you to look at ways to further relax restrictive barriers.
information systems by supporting the development of a truly global market for secure desktop communications.  This will help establish private and secure spaces for the work of users, which is of particular interest to the members of the IEEE/USA and the USACM.
to working with you on this important legislation to relax export controls and promote the development of a robust, secure, and reliable communications infrastructure for the twenty-first century.

The draft bill which currently exists only takes the export controls on
crpyto. The provisions on key escrow, criminal penalities and other problems
are not in there and Burns staff have no intention of letting them in. The
actual bill will be introduced in about 2 weeks.

The export language comes from the origional Cantwell bill and orders the
Commerce Sec. to allow export of mass market software and allows somewhat more
limited export of non-mass market software dependng on what is available to
banks in that country. Its not ideal (I think the limits on non-mass market
should be the same as mass market- almost none except for a limited number of
"terrorist" countries (we'd get killed if we argue that those should be
eliminated) but overall much better than leahy's and somewhat better than
goodlatte's bill.

           Groups Urge Good Technology for Privacy and Security
                  Senator Burns to Introduce Legislation
                ------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON, DC -- A new coalition today urged support for strong technologies
to protect privacy and security on the rapidly growing Internet. The Internet
Privacy Coalition said that new technologies were critical to protect private
communications and on-line commerce, and recommended relaxation of export
controls that limit the ability of US firms to incorporate encryption in
commercial products.
Phil Zimmermann, author of the popular encryption program Pretty Good Privacy,
expressed support for the effort of the new coalition. "It is time to change
crypto policy in the United States. I urge those who favor good tools for
privacy to back the efforts of the Internet Privacy Coalition."
GOLDEN KEY CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED
The Coalition has asked companies and Internet users to display a golden key
and envelope to show support for strong encryption technology. Copies of the
logo are available at the group's web page on the Internet. According to Lori Fena, director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the
purpose of the campaign is to educate the public about new techniques for
privacy protection. "Society's feelings about privacy have not changed, only
the medium has," said Ms. Fena.
US industry has pressed the US government to relax export controls on
encryption as consumer demand for software products has increased. They cite
the fact that foreign companies have been able to sell strong products in
overseas markets that are now restricted for US firms.
Jim Bidzos, President and CEO of RSA Data Security, said that US firms
continue to face excessive burdens. "Encryption is the key to on-line
commerce.  Government regulations are simply keeping US firms out of important
The Internet Privacy Coalition is the first attempt to bring together a broad
base of companies, cryptographers and public interest organizations around the
central goal of promoting privacy and security on the Internet and urging
relaxation of export controls.
Dr. Barbara Simons, chair of the public policy committee of the Association
for Computing said, "The broad support for the Golden Key campaign shows that
the reform of encryption policy is a shared goal for companies, users, and
professional associations."
SENATOR BURNS TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION
The Internet Privacy Coalition is being established as Congress considers new
legislation to relax export controls on encryption. Senator Conrad Burns
(R-MT) today introduced legislation that would relax export controls on
commercial products containing technologies for privacy such as encryption.
Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said
"We believe that Senator Burns has put forward a constructive proposal. We
look forward to working with him to ensure that good tools for privacy and
security are widely available to Internet users."
Hearings on Senator Burns bill are expected to take place in early June. The
proposal has already gathered support from a bipartisan coalition in Congress.
For Internet users who are interested in following the debate about encryption
policy, the IPC has set up a Web page with information about encryption
regulations, court challenges, legislative developments, and organizations and
companies involved in the campaign.
The Internet Privacy Coalition was established by more than a dozen of the
nation's leading cryptographers, and thirty associations, companies, and civil
liberties organizations committed to strong privacy and security technology
for all users of the Internet.                      URL:                             ----------------------------------------------
A KEY, AN ENVELOPE -- Both are historic means for communicating privately and
protecting personal information.  Today, encryption tools provide this privacy
in the electronic world.
The Golden Key Campaign is being launched to raise awareness and support for
the preservation of the right to communicate privately and the availability of
new techniques which make it possible.
Privacy, a fundamental human right, has been affirmed by the US Supreme Court,
the constitutions and laws of many countries, and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Privacy must be preserved as we move
from paper to electronic communications.
The Internet Privacy Coalition is urging members of the net community to
display a Golden Key & Envelope symbol on their Web pages to show support for
the right of privacy and the freedom to use good tools of privacy without
government restraints.

A federal judge in Philadelphia has issued a partial temporary restraining order prohibiting enforcement of the "indecency" provision of the Communications Decency Act (CDA).  The judge declined to enjoin those provisions of the Act dealing with "patently offensive" communications.
The court agreed with the plaintiffs' claim that the CDA will have a chilling effect on free speech on the Internet and found that the CDA raises "serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful questions."  The court further agreed that the CDA is "unconstitutionally vague" as to the prosecution for indecency.  But the court left open the possibility that the government could prosecute under the "patently offensive" provisions
The court has recognized the critical problem with the CDA, which is the attempt to apply the indecency standard to on-line communications.  Nonetheless, online speech remains at risk because of the sweeping nature of the CDA. The entry of the court order is a strong indication that the "indecency" provision of the legislation that went into effect on February 8 will not survive constitutional scrutiny by a three-
judge panel that has been impaneled in Philadelphia.  The panel will fully evaluate the constitutional validity of the legislation and consider entry of a permanent injunction against enforcement of the new law.
The temporary restraining order (TRO) was issued in a lawsuit filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), the American Civil Liberties Union and a broad coalition of organizations.  EPIC is also participating as co-counsel in the litigation.  The court ruling comes in the wake of widespread denunciation of the CDA, which was included in the telecommunications reform bill signed into law last week.
According to EPIC Legal Counsel David Sobel, one of the attorneys
representing the coalition, "The court's decision is a partial victory for free speech, but expression on the Internet remains at risk.  This is destined to become a landmark case that will determine the future of the Internet."  Looking ahead to proceedings before the three-judge panel, Sobel said "we are optimistic that further litigation of this case will demonstrate to the court that the CDA, in its entirety, does not pass constitutional muster."
EPIC has maintained since its introduction in Congress that the ban on "indecent" and "patently offensive" electronic speech is a clear violation of the free speech and privacy rights of millions of Internet users.

This is the written testimony of FBI Director Freeh before the
Senate Commerce Committee on S 1726, the Pro-Code legislation.
Freeh called for the adoption of an universal key escrow system
that would facilitate law enforcement access.Several Senators were critical of Freeh's testimony and asked why
he and the other panelists believed that savy criminals would
use escrowed encryption. Others questioned the possibility to any
kind of world wide agreement could be reached.
Director Freeh admitted in responding to one Senator that he would
seek legislation to ban non-escrow cryptography if it were not
widely adopted. He said, "we are not at the point yet that volutary
is not vialble. At that point, we would look at mandatory controls."
He also stated that he would also ask for import controls to be imposed "if the country was flooded with foreign robust encryption."

[1] White House Releases New Clipper Proposal
The White House has released the latest version of the key
escrow/recovery plan intended to promote government access to encoded
communications. The new proposal follows similar proposals in which
the Administration offers to relax export regulations in exchange for
an industry commitment to establish key escrow encryption.
Under the plan announced by the Office of the Vice President on
October 1, 1996, companies would be allowed to export 56-bit
encryption systems for the next two years if they setup a formal
process to fully develop a key escrow system. After two years,
non-escrow systems would be prohibited. Jurisdiction for the control
of exports would also be transferred from the State Department to the
Commerce Department. The Justice Department would be given veto power
over export applications. The White House plans to introduce
legislation for key escrow centers.
According to the statement released by the Vice President, the
Administration will continue to promote key escrow encryption through
the purchase of key recovery products, bilateral and multilateral
discussions, federal cryptographic and key recovery standards, and
federal funding.
The statement also said that "the Administration's initiative is
broadly consistent with the recent recommendations of the National
Research Council." However, the NRC report recommended against
government promotion of key escrow encryption, noting that "the risks
of key escrow encryption are considerable," Earlier this year, the
Internet Society also endorsed a recommendation of the Internet
Architecture Board and the Internet Engineering Steering Group which
said that "such policies are against the interests of consumers and
the business community, and are largely irrelevant to issues of
military security."
IBM announced that it would establish an industry consortium to
support the plan, and several US hardware companies signed on.
However, Netscape head Jim Barkesdale described the proposal as
"extortion". Bipartisan criticism was also heard from Congress. Both
Senator Leahy and Senator Burns quickly issued releases criticizing
the proposal.
The software industry expressed opposition to the White House plan.

and the International Technology Association of America criticized the

policy. The symposium was scheduled to coincide with an OECD meeting
to consider new guidelines on international cryptography policy. The
conference on the "Public Voice in the Development of International
Encryption Policy" was sponsored by EPIC and Planete Internet and held
in the Centre de Conferences des Internationales.
Justice Michael Kirby, a member of the High Court of Australia and
former chair of the OECD expert panels on security and privacy, opened
the conference with remarks that placed the current effort to develop
cryptography guidelines in the larger context of the OECD's work on
privacy and information security and the ongoing need to recognize
human rights concerns.
Justice Kirby, drawing on his international human rights work in the
area of HIV/AIDS, urged participants to keep in mind ten principles
for the development of sound policies. Justice Kirby concluded his
remarks with an appeal that "the claims of national security and law
enforcement agencies be attained within a context of
constitutionalism, the rule of law and respect for, and effective
protection of human rights." Kirby reminded those present that
"respect of human rights, and especially individual privacy" is "the
ultimate common denominator of the OECD."
Welcoming remarks were provided Mr. Norman Reaburn the Chair of the
OECD Expert Panel on Cryptography Policy, Mr. John Dryden the head of
the OECD Secretariat, and Mr. Marc Rotenberg the director of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) in Washington, DC. The
panels were moderated by OECD delegates from Australia, Canada,
Germany, and Japan.
The first panel "Cryptography Policy: The View of Cryptographers"
featured Dr. Ross Anderson of the University of Cambridge, Dr. Matt
Blaze of AT&T Laboratories, Dr. Whitfield Diffie of Sun Microsystems,
Mr. Yves Le Roux of Digital Research, and Dr. Herb Lin of the National
Research Council.
The second panel "Human Rights Issues in the Development of
Cryptography Policy" featured Mr. Dave Banisar of EPIC, Mme. Louise
Cadoux of the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertes,
Mr. Simon Davies of Privacy International, Mr. Barry Steinhardt with
the American Civil Liberties Union, and Mr. Alain Weber of the French
Human Rights League
The third panel "User Needs for Strong Cryptography" featured Dr.
Brian Carpenter of the Internet Architecture Board, Dr. Stephane
Bortzmeyer of the Association des Utilisateurs d'Internet, and Mr.
Phil Zimmerman of the Pretty Good Privacy Inc.
The final panel "Legal Dimensions and Cryptography Policy" featured
Mr. Victor Mayer-Schoenberger of the Austrian Institute for Law and
Policy, Mr. Kevin O'Connor the Australian Privacy Commissioner, and
Prof. Joel Reidenberg of the Fordham Law School and the Sorbonne.

  [3] OECD Crypto Panels Meets in Paris
Following the EPIC/Planete Internet conference, the OECD Member
countries met in Paris for two days to discuss Cryptography Policy
Guidelines that could provide internationally comparable criteria for
encryption of computerised information.
According to the OECD, the Guidelines identify the issues which
countries should take into consideration in formulating cryptography
policies at the national and international level. An OECD press
statement said that, "Discussions have focused on the rights of users
to choose cryptographic methods, the freedom of the market to develop
them, interoperability, consequences for the protection of personal
data and privacy, lawful access to encrypted data, and reducing the
barriers to international trade."
The OECD Guidelines will be non-binding recommendations to Member
governments, meaning that they will not be part of international law,
nor will they endorse any specific cryptography system.
The Group of Experts on Cryptography Policy will continue discussions
the week of December 16, with a view to completion this year of a
draft of the Guidelines which would be forwarded for approval by the
Council of the OECD early in 1997.

 [4] Human Rights Groups Release Privacy Resolution More than a dozen international human rights and cyber rights
organizations recently endorsed a resolution in Support of the Freedom
to Use Encryption. The resolution was released in Paris on September
25, just prior to the meeting of the OECD.
Noting that "national governments have already taken steps to detain
and to harass users and developers of cryptography technology" and
that "cryptography is already in use by human rights advocates who
face persecution by their national governments," the organizations
urged the OECD to "base its cryptography policies on the fundamental
right of citizens to engage in private communication."
The organizations further urged the OECD to "resist policies that
would encourage the development of communication networks designed for
The organizations that endorsed the resolution included ALCEI
(Electronic Frontiers Italy), the American Civil Liberties Union,
Association des Utilisateurs d'Internet, CITADEL-EF France, Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility, cyberPOLIS, Digital Citizens
Foundation in the Netherlands, EFF-Austin, Electronic Frontier
Australia, Electronic Frontier Canada, Electronic Frontier Foundation,
Electronic Privacy Information Center, Human Rights Watch, NetAction,
and Privacy International

  [5] E-FOIA Bill Approved by House and Senate
Congress has passed and sent to the President the Electronic Freedom
of Information Act Amendments of 1996. The "E-FOIA" legislation
requires federal agencies to make information available to requesters
in electronic form "if the record is readily reproducible by the
agency in that form or format." It also requires agencies to maintain
indices of previously released documents that are "likely to become
the subject of subsequent requests," and to make such indices
available "by computer telecommunications" no later than December 31,
The legislation also attempts to tackle the perennial problem of
agency delays in responding to FOIA requests. These provisions include
the establishment of "multitrack processing of requests ... based on
the amount of work or time (or both) involved," and the expedited
processing of requests upon a showing of "compelling need." It is
likely that these new provisions, like earlier FOIA amendments
designed to improve public access, will be applied narrowly by federal
agencies and become the subject of litigation.

   [6] P-TRAK SSN System Criticism Continues
Opposition to the proliferation of commercial databases exploded into
public view recently when the Lexis-Nexis P-TRAK "personal locator"
system prompted a flood of angry e-mail and telephone calls to the
information service company. The P-TRAK database originally allowed
Lexis-Nexis subscribers to search under an individual's name and
access telephone numbers, addresses, previous addresses, maiden names
and Social Security numbers (SSNs). After an initial flurry of
complaints in June, the company claimed that it had eliminated SSNs
from its database. After the recent flare-up, the firm provided a
clarification: SSNs are no longer searchable using an individual's
name, but a subscriber can start with an SSN (or any nine-digit
number, for that matter), and obtain all of the personally-identifying
information that goes along with that number.
Also, contrary to claims of the Lexis/Nexis company, the personal data
was not publicly available, nor is it similar to "white pages"
information. In fact, Lexis/Nexis obtained the P-TRAK personal locator
information from TransUnion, a credit reporting agency. The two
companies exploited a loophole in the Fair Credit Reporting Act which
leaves credit "header" information unprotected even though the
associated credit report could not be disclosed.
In the wake of the P-TRAK episode, the Federal Trade Commission
recommended that Congress take steps to provide greater protection for
sensitive information. The FTC says that it has received "numerous
complaints "... concerning recently-introduced, widely-available
commercial services that provide, for a fee, identifying information
on individuals." Congress adjourned before it could act, but is likely
to take up the issue next year.

   [7] Avrahami Files Appeal to State Supreme Court
Ram Avrahami, the Virginia resident who brought suit last year against
U.S. News and World Report for selling his name without his consent,
has appealed the decision of a lower court to the Virginia State
Supreme Court.
Mr. Avrahami argues that the lower court wrongly dismissed his claim.
He argues that under Virginia law "the unauthorized sale, exchange, or
rental of a person's name as part of a mailing list violates the
Privacy Act's prohibition on using a person's name for the purposes of
trade." He also contends, among other points, that "the Mail
Preference Service established by the Direct Marketing Association is
no substitute for the 'written consent' required by the Privacy Act."
U.S. News & World Report will reply to Mr. Avrahami's motion and then
the Virginia Supreme Court must decide whether to review the decision
of the lower court.

EXTENSIVE NATIONAL ID CARD WEB SITE IS NOW ON LINE
The London-based human rights watchdog Privacy International (PI)
has just opened an extensive web page on National ID cards. The
initiative comes in the wake of pending efforts in the United
States, Canada and United Kingdom to implement national ID card
The page contains a 7,000 word FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) on
all aspects of ID cards and their implications. Also included in the
PI documents is a paper describing successful campaigns opposing to
ID cards in Australia and other countries.  The page also has links
to numerous other sites and documents.
PI Director Simon Davies said he hoped the page would help promote
debate about the cards, "ID cards are often introduced without
serious discussion or consultation. The implications are profound,
and countries planning to introduce them should proceed with
"The existence of a card challenges important precepts of individual
rights and privacy. At a symbolic and a functional level, ID cards
are often an unnecessary and potentially dangerous white elephant.
They are promoted by way of fear-mongering and false patriotism, and
are implemented with scant regard for serious investigation of the
consequences." he said.

GENETICS AS A SURVEILLANCE IDEOLOGY
Researches in the field of genetics are still largely dominated by the
works of molecular biologists who tend to comprehend reality through the
classical Cartesian-Newtonian paradigm which postulates that it is possible
to reduce the universe to a mechanical model in which peticular effects can
be described as the direct results of specific causes. Such an approach
does not acknowledge the fact that human physical and mental health is the
result of very complex interactions. Most illnesses and deviant behaviors
are multifactorial (physical and social environments are at least as much
important as the genetic factors) and polygenic (numerous genes could be
involved). In short, there are large  probabilities that an individual
carrying many "defective" genes may never develop the corresponding
illness. Unfortunately, such fields of activities such as risk management,
insurance, law and policy-making also work mostly within the
Cartesian-Newtonian paradigm. In such a context, genetics can easily be
transformed into an ideological justification for surveillance and social
control of populations or individuals "at risk" as well as minimizing
social and environmental responsabilities.

[1] White House Panel Endorses Airport "Profiling" System
In the wake of perceived terrorist threats and the mysterious crash of
TWA Flight 800 in July, a Presidential advisory panel has proposed an
automated system for increased screening and "profiling" of airline
passengers for all domestic and international flights.  In its interim
report sent to President Clinton on September 9, the White House
Commission on Aviation Safety and Security provided few specifics, but
noted that "[b]ased on information that is already in computer
databases, passengers could be separated into a very large majority
who present little or no risk, and a small minority who merit
additional attention."
Details of the profiling system will presumably be withheld from the
public on national security grounds -- a substantial portion of the
Commission's "public" meeting on September 5 was closed to permit the
discussion of "classified" matters.  Nonetheless, the proposed system
appears to raise substantial privacy issues.  The Washington Post
recently reported that under the proposal, "the federal government
would require creation of a computer profiling system that would
examine passengers' bill-paying records, flying habits and much other
data to determine which checked baggage should undergo examination by
sophisticated explosives detection equipment."  The Commission's
initial report also calls for FBI and CIA involvement in the
development of the profiling database.
The theory underlying the profiling proposal appears to be that even
seemingly innocuous bits of personal data can raise the suspicions of
a law enforcement agency.  This point is illustrated by the comments
of an unidentified FBI agent recently quoted in a New York Times
article. Discussing the Bureau's investigation of the bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103 over Scotland, the agent noted that, "Almost everyone on
the plane, almost everyone you ever met, has something that can get
your imagination going.  A recent fight, a divorce, a business deal,
an overseas connection -- when you don't know what you're looking for,
it's easy to see all kinds of possibilities."
EPIC plans to monitor the development of the automated passenger
profiling system under the public oversight provisions of the Federal
Advisory Committee Act, which governs the proceedings of the White
House Commission.

     [2] EPIC Testifies on Children's' Privacy Bill
EPIC Director Marc Rotenberg testified today before the House
Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime in support of the Childrens
Privacy Protection and Parental Empowerment Act of 1996.  The bill
would establish basic privacy standards for organizations that collect
personal information on children and curb recent abuses in the
marketing industry.  The bill is sponsored by Rep. Bob Franks (R-NJ)
and has 46 cosponsors in the House of Representatives.  A similar
measure has been introduced in the Senate by Senator Diane Feinstein
Rotenberg said that "current practices pose a substantial threat to
the privacy and safety of young people."  He described a recent
incident where a reporter posing as the murderer of Polly Klaas was
able to obtain the ages and address of young children living in the
Pasadena area.  Rotenberg also cited editorials from USA Today and the
Economist favoring privacy legislation as well as public opinion polls
which show that 9 out of 10 Americans object to the sale of personal
data where explicit consent is not obtained.
Recalling the passage of the Family Educational Right to Privacy Act
of 1974, which protects the privacy of student records, Rotenberg said
there was already Congressional recognition of the need to protect
personal information about young children. "No universities have been
shut down because of the Act, but the privacy of children's
educational records is more secure because Congress did not fail to
act when it had the opportunity to establish privacy protection for
young people."  testifying in support of the bill were Rep. Bob
Franks, children rights advocate Marc Klaas, and Miriam Bell of Enough
is Enough. Marc Klaas also heads the Klaas Foundation for Children
which launched the Kids Off Lists campaign.
Testifying against the bill were representatives from the Direct
Marketing Association, a list broker, a book publisher, and a police
officer from San Bernadino.

   [3] House Panel Probes White House Database
The General Accounting Office revealed at a hearing of a subcommittee
of the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight on September
11 that the secret White House database of 200,000 people has
inadequate controls on access. The GAO reported that the database,
this existence of which, was revealed during the Filegate controversy,
does not keep track of what files have been viewed by the 150 White
House staffers who are authorized to access the files.
The database contains 125 different fields of information for each
file. Several thousand files included ethnic and political
information. The GAO did not reveal in its testimony what was
contained in the other fields. According to news reports, the database
was designed to link into other related databases, including the
Secret Service and the Democratic National Committee.
The White House claims that the database is used for a number of
reasons, including, for invite lists for White House events, tracking
correspondence, sending out Christmas cards and other matters.
Congressional Republicans claim that it is more akin to the Nixon
"enemies list."
The database was created by PRC Inc., a company that also creates
databases for the CIA and other intelligence agencies, among other
government agencies.
[4] Crypto Update
As the election approaches and Congress scrambles to complete its
agenda before recessing for the year, members are continuing to deal
with cryptography-related issues.
The Senate Commerce Committee delayed its scheduled vote on S. 1735,
the Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era, originally
planned for September 12. The Committee is expected to take up the
measure next week. Members of the Committee have reported receiving a
large number of calls supporting the bill. Individuals interested in
supporting the bill should continue calling members of the Committee.
The House is planning to hold hearings at the end of September to
examine the companion House bill. The hearings were originally
scheduled for September 11 but were delayed due to other legislative
The White House is also expected to introduce its own legislation next
week. According to reporter Brock Meeks, the legislation will offer
"sweetheart deals" to limited segments of the industry including
financial, health care and insurance sectors who would then agree to
support government key escrow systems. The systems would then become
de facto mandatory.
Internationally, an expert committee of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development is meeting on September 26-27 to review
draft guidelines on cryptography policy. The US has been pressuring
the OECD to adopt its key escrow proposals as an international
standard but has been opposed by other countries and business
EPIC will be hosting an international symposium in Paris on September
25, in cooperation with the OECD, to provide an opportunity for
cryptographers, human rights advocates, privacy experts and user
associations to present public concerns about the development of
international privacy guidelines. The event will feature speakers from
more than a dozen countries and includes US cryptographers Matt Blaze,
Whit Diffie, and Phil Zimmermann.
On September 20, oral arguments will be heard in the Daniel
Bernstein's challenge to the constitutionality of export controls in
federal court in San Francisco. Bernstein is arguing that the controls
violate the First Amendment. Judge Marilyn Patel ruled preliminarily
in May that software code is speech protected by the First Amendment

    [5] Anonymous Remailer Shuts Down
Johann Helsingius, the operator of the anon.penet.fi anonymous e-mail
service has decided to shut down his remailer service because of the
unknown legal protections of privacy on the Internet. He had come
received requests by the Church of Scientology and the Singapore
government demanding to know the identity of some of his users.
In a press release, he said that he hoped to bring the server back up
once the Finnish government enacted new laws protecting privacy of
electronic messages, "I will close down the remailer for the time
being because the legal issues governing the Internet in Finland are
yet undefined. The legal protection of the users needs to be
clarified. At the moment the privacy of Internet messages is
judicially unclear."

PRESS RELEASE
April 23, 1997
       LETTER TO CHANCELLOR KOHL URGES INVESTIGATION
                  OF COMPUSERVE PROSECUTION
A coalition of civil liberties organizations from a dozen countries
has written to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to express concern
about the prosecution of an official from the Compuserve
company which is making makes available Internet access to
German subscribers. The official has been indicted by local
The letter states the prosecution of the Compuserve manager Mr. Felix
Somm is "ill-advised for both technical and regulatory reasons"
and will "have a harmful impact on Internet users around the world."
The groups said that "the charges against CompuServe will establish a
harmful precedent, and may encourage other governments to censor speech,
limit political debate, control artistic expression, and otherwise deny the
opportunity for individuals to be fully informed."
The organizations signing the letter, which was organized by the
Global Internet Liberty Campaign, include the American Civil Liberties
Union, Arge Daten, Association des Utilisateurs d'Internet, Derechos
Human Rights, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Human Rights Watch,
the Internet Society, and Privacy International.
Felipe Rodriquez, the administrator for XS4ALL, an internet provider
that was recently blocked by German authorities in a separate
matter said, "Is is not possible for a provider to censor the Internet
according to the local law, custom or tradition. The Internet is too
international and too dynamic for that to be possible. Censoring the
Internet has, in most cases, proved to be counterproductive."
Andy Oram, a member of the Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility in the United States, said that he thought the
attempts by German to limit use of the Internet in this manner
were impractical. "Even if an Internet provider is notified that
illegal material is coming from a certain site and cuts off all
access to that site, the publisher of the material can easily find
another site from which to send it."
The groups also noted their support for efforts now underway in
the German parliament to liberalize the use of the Internet.
"We believe that the measure now under consideration to reduce
liability for Internet services will do much to ensure the protection
of personal freedoms in the future," said the organizations.
The Global Internet Liberty Campaign was established at the annual
meeting of the Internet Society in June 1996 in Montreal. It maintains
a web site at  with links to all of the member
Last September the group organized a conference in Paris to
educate members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development about the need to develop cryptography polices
that protected privacy and fundamental human rights. Aspects
of the GILC recommendations were incorporated in the OECD
Cryptography Guidelines released earlier this year.

Moderator: Barbara Simons, Chair, USACM
  o What is the role of copyright in all-electronic publication world?
  Will it be replaced by contract law?
  o Can the needs of authors who want to publish for renown (academics) and
  authors that want to publish for pay (entertainment etc) be handled in one
  mechanism?
  o Should browsing on the World Wide Web of full copyrighted texts be made
  illegal because people make temporary copies in their computer's memory
  when they look at a web page?
  o Should online service providers, including libraries and universities,
  have to monitor user accounts in order to enforce copyright laws?
  o Should firms that compile data have intellectual property rights so
  that scientists and news reporters can't use the data without permission
  or payments?
  o How should existing differences in national copyright be handled in a
  networked world where national boundaries and are little more than a
  speedbump on the information superhighway?
  o Does technological protection for copyrighted works inherently undermine
  fair use ?
These and related issues will confront the 105th Congress in the coming year.
They will also be examined by this panel, which will discuss controversies
surrounding the extension of copyright law to deal with cyberspace.
Examples include: How does proposed legislation reflect the net?
How much influence have lobbyists for the entertainment industry had
in writing legislation?  What should be the role of professional
societies in analyzing policy initiatives?
We will discussed legislation and international treaties that
have been proposed by the White House.  We will also examine both
technical and legal approaches to problems created by the net,
as well as how various approaches might impact the
science, technology, and business communities.
A significant amount of time will be allowed for audience
interaction in the discussion.

Vice President Albert Gore, Jr.
The White House
1600 Pennsylvanpia Ave, NW
Washington, DC 20500
Dear Mr. Vice President,

airline security.  These include recent orders issued by the Federal
Aviation Administration, and also proposals recommended by the White House
Commission on Aviation Safety and Security and the FAA Advisory Aviation
Security Advisory Committee.

a misguided rationale that something had to be done, no matter how marginal
in value or violative of individual rights.
feel that to set foot on an airplane or an airport is to take a substantial
safety risk.  However, basic civil liberties protected by the Constitution
should not be sacrificed in the name of improving air safety, especially
where the potential benefits are questionable.  At the airport ticket
counter, passengers check their luggage, not their constitutional rights.
apparently revised in October 1995. The FAA order purportedly requires
airlines to demand government-issued photo identification from all
passengers before they can board an airplane.  It remains unclear whether a
passenger must provide that identification and what discretion an airline
has to allow, or refuse, any passenger to board if they refuse to provide
identification or simply do not have any available.
identification documents. Any requirement that passengers show
identification raises substantial constitutional questions about
violations of the rights to privacy, travel, and due process of law.  The
Supreme Court has consistently struck down laws that interfere with the
constitutional right to travel.  The Court has also overturned laws in a
variety of circumstances that require an individual to provide
identification in the absence of any specific suspicion that a crime has
been committed.  In addition, it is unclear that requiring passenger
boarding an aircraft to identify him or herself actually makes the people
with whom they travel any safer. A bomber with a fake ID is just as
effective as a bomber with no ID.
that identification should not be requested for security reasons.  At a
minimum, the FAA should require airlines to post notices telling passengers
that they cannot be denied boarding just because they fail or refuse to
identify themselves.
Computer Databases and Profiling
of the practice of "profiling" passengers to determine whether they pose a
security risk and should thus be searched. This would require the
collection of personal information on passengers prior to their boarding a
plane.  Information that may be collected includes a picture or other
biometric identifier, address, flying patterns with a particular airline,
bill paying at a particular address, criminal records, and other
information. This, and information gleaned from observing the persons with
whom the passenger was traveling, would be fed into a computer data base
that would be used to decide whether the passenger "fits the profile" and
should be subjected to heightened security measures.  Under this proposal,
the checked luggage of people selected by the computer would be scanned by
new sophisticated scanning devices.
"fit the profile." For this system to be useful, it must apply to every
person who might take a flight, i.e., to everybody. A new government
dossier on everyone would have to be created, computerized, and made
accessible to airline personnel.
linked to other data bases and constantly updated. Each time a person
changes their address or takes another flight, or does anything related to
the characteristics about them deemed significant by the profiling system,
the government would track it. All of our experience with the creation and
updating of such ever-changing data bases teaches us that the likelihood of
inaccuracy at any given moment is high.  The FBI, for instance, recognizes
that data in its computer system  of criminal records has an inaccuracy
rate of 33 percent. Such inaccuracy would lead to both a breach of safety
and to violations of the rights of innocent people. This proposal is a
quick fix that won't fix anything.
Information Practices and the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C � 552a): information
given to the government for one purpose ought not be used for other
purposes without the consent of the person to whom it pertains. The use of
criminal records in such a data base, particularly where those records
include arrests that do not result in convictions, is particularly
Already, we have received numerous reports of discrimination against
individuals and families with children who have been refused entry onto
aircraft because their names appeared to be of Middle-Eastern origin. In
the well publicized example of security guard Richard Jewel, reports
indicated that the FBI profile led the police to unfairly target Mr. Jewel
for the incident, even in the absence of other evidence. This incident
vividly shows the limitations of basing a law enforcement decision on a
X-Ray Cameras
cameras which can depict highly detailed images of individuals' bodies
under their clothes.  Existing scanners, the development of which was
partially funded by the FAA, already show a revealing and invasive picture
of a naked body in high detail and the technology is likely to improve.
This is clearly a search under the Fourth Amendment and is far more
intrusive than a standard metal screening device.  Passengers should not be
subject to an "electronic strip search" in order to board an aircraft. To
expose travelers' anatomies to the general public or even to selected (not
by the victim of the unreasonably intrusive search) strangers is extremely
embarrassing and shocking to the conscience.

results to improve airline safety. We urge the FAA and the advisory
commissions to focus their efforts on improving security in a balanced and
rational manner that is open to public scrutiny and consistent with

         EPIC HAILS SUPREME COURT INTERNET "INDECENCY" DECISION:
        OPINION "PRESERVES BOTH FREE SPEECH AND PERSONAL PRIVACY"
WASHINGTON, DC -- The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) today
hailed the Supreme Court's Internet speech decision as "the first landmark
decision of the 21st Century."  In its first opinion involving cyberspace,
the Court, by a 7-2 vote, struck down the online censorship provisions of
the Communications Decency Act (CDA) (Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice
O'Connor concurred in part and dissented in part).  EPIC participated in
the litigation as both plaintiff and co-counsel.
"Today's opinion defines the First Amendment for the next century,"
according to EPIC Legal Counsel David Sobel, who served as co-counsel in
Reno v. ACLU.  "The Court has written on a clean slate and established the
fundamental principles that will govern free speech issues for the
electronic age."
Sobel said that today's landmark decision "preserves both free speech and
personal privacy in this rapidly growing medium."  Throughout the
litigation of the case, EPIC has stressed that the CDA not only infringed
on Americans' free speech rights, but also posed a grave threat to personal
privacy.  By requiring "speakers" on the Internet to verify the age and
identity of all potential recipients of "indecent" material, the law would
have destroyed the anonymity that is a hallmark of online communications.
EPIC noted that a good deal of sensitive information -- dealing with AIDS
prevention, teenage pregnancy, and other critical social issues -- would
not be sought out if recipients were required to identify themselves.
EPIC joined with the American Civil Liberties Union and 18 other plaintiffs
in challenging the law on February 8, 1996, the day it was signed by
President Clinton.  A three-judge federal court panel in Philadelphia
unanimously ruled on June 11, 1996, that the Internet "indecency"
provisions violated the First Amendment's free speech protections.  That
decision was today affirmed by the  United States Supreme Court.
A copy of the Court's decision is available at:

civil liberties and privacy issues arising in new electronic media.

ABOUT PRIVACY INTERNATIONAL
Privacy International was formed in 1990 as a watchdog on
surveillance by governments and corporations. With members in
more than 40 countries, it has created an international
movement that has helped to counter abuses of privacy by way
of information technology. Privacy International has conducted
campaigns in Europe, Asia and North America to raise awareness
about the dangers of ID card systems, military surveillance,
data matching, police information systems, and credit
reporting. It is based in London, UK, and is administered by
the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) in
Washington, D.C. Privacy International publishes a quarterly
newsletter (the International Privacy Bulletin) and organizes
conferences each year on privacy and technology. More information
is available at ABOUT THE GLOBAL INTERNET LIBERTY CAMPAIGN
The Global Internet Liberty Campaign is an international
coalition of 28 human rights, free speech, cyber-liberties and
privacy groups that has come together to promote free speech
and privacy on the Internet. More information is available

EPIC Preliminary Analysis of E-PRIVACY Act
                           May 12, 1998
                          Washington, DC
Senators John Ashcroft (R-MO) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) today
introduced the "Encryption Protects the Rights of Individuals from
Violation and Abuse in Cyberspace (E-PRIVACY) Act."  The proposed
legislation is the latest in a series of congressional measures
designed to resolve the debate surrounding current U.S. encryption
policy.  Like the SAFE Act (H.R. 695) now pending in the House,
the E-PRIVACY Act seeks to relax existing controls on the export
of encryption products.  Controls would be lifted for encryption
products that are deemed to be "generally available" within the
international market.  Exporters would be given new procedural
rights to obtain expedited determinations on the exportability of
their products.
The bill also contains several provisions that would preserve the
right of Americans to use encryption techniques and that would
enhance the privacy protections currently accorded to personal
communications and stored data.  Among its positive features, the
* Reiterates the right of Americans to use, develop, manufacture,
sell, distribute, or import any encryption product, regardless of
the algorithm selected, key length, or the existence of key
recovery capabilities;
* Prohibits government-compelled key escrow or key recovery;
* Prohibits government agencies from creating any linkage between
cryptographic methods used for authentication and those used for
* Prohibits the federal government from purchasing key recovery
encryption systems that are not interoperable with other
commercial encryption products; and
* Provides enhanced privacy protections for stored electronic data
held by third parties, location information generated by wireless
communications services, and transactional information obtained
from pen registers and trap and trace devices;
The bill contains two provisions that raise significant civil
liberties and privacy concerns.
The Criminalization Provision
The bill would make the use of encryption to conceal
"incriminating" communications or information during the
commission of a crime a new and independent criminal offense.
While well-intended, the provision could have several unintended
consequences that would easily undermine the other desirable
features of the bill.
We believe it is a mistake to create criminal penalties for the
use of a particular technique or device. Such a provision tends to
draw attention away from the underlying criminal act and casts a
shadow over a valuable technology that should not be criminalized.
It may, for instance, be the case that a typewritten ransom note
poses a more difficult challenge for forensic investigators than a
handwritten note. But it would be a mistake to criminalize the use
of a typewriter simply because it could make it more difficult to
investigate crime in some circumstances.
Additionally, a provision which criminalizes the use of
encryption, even in furtherance of a crime, would give prosecutors
wide latitude to investigate activity where the only indicia of
criminal conduct may be the mere presence of encrypted data. In
the digital age, where techniques to protect privacy and security
will be widely deployed, we cannot afford to view encryption as
the potential instrumentality of a crime, just as we would not
today view the use of a typewriter with suspicion.
Finally, the provision could also operate as a substantial
disincentive to the widespread adoption of strong encryption
techniques in the communications infrastructure. Given that the
availability of strong encryption is one of the best ways to
reduce the risk of crime and to promote public safety, the
retention of this provision in the legislation will send a mixed
message to users and businesses -- that we want people to be free
to use encryption but will be suspicious when it is used.
If the concern is that encryption techniques may be used to
obstruct access to evidence relevant to criminal investigations,
we submit that the better approach may be to rely on other
provisions in the federal and state criminal codes (including
sections relating to obstruction of justice or concealment) to
address this problem if it arises.
The "NET Center"
The bill creates within the Department of Justice a National
Electronic Technology Center (NET Center) to "serve as a center
for . . . law enforcement authorities for information and
assistance regarding decryption and other access requirements."
The NET Center would have a broad mandate and could spawn a new
domestic surveillance bureaucracy within the Department of
Justice.  Among other powers, the bill authorizes the NET Center
* Examine encryption techniques and methods to facilitate the
ability of law enforcement to gain efficient access to plaintext
of communications and electronic information;
* Conduct research to develop efficient methods, and improve the
efficiency of existing methods, of accessing plaintext of
communications and electronic information;
* Investigate and research new and emerging techniques and
technologies to facilitate access to communications and electronic
information; and
* Obtain information regarding the most current hardware,
software, telecommunications, and other capabilities to understand
how to access digitized information transmitted across networks.
The mission of the NET Center is made more troubling by the bill's
authorization of "assistance" from other federal agencies,
including the detailing of personnel to the new entity.  In light
of the fact that existing federal expertise in the areas of
electronic surveillance and decryption resides at the National
Security Agency (NSA), the bill in effect authorizes unprecedented
NSA involvement in domestic law enforcement activities.  Such a
result would be contrary to a half-century-old consensus that
intelligence agencies must be strictly constrained from engaging
in domestic "police functions."
That consensus arose from the recognition that intelligence
agencies created to operate abroad are ill-suited for domestic
activities, where U.S. citizens enjoy constitutional protections
against governmental intrusions.  In 1975, Sen. Frank Church led a
congressional investigation into the activities of NSA.  He noted
that Congress had a "particular obligation to examine the NSA, in
light of its tremendous potential for abuse. ... The danger lies
in the ability of NSA to turn its awesome technology against
domestic communications."
In 1987, Congress enacted the Computer Security Act, which sought
to vest civilian computer security authority in the Commerce
Department and to limit the domestic role of NSA.  The House
Report on the Computer Security Act cited congressional concern
over a Reagan Administration directive that "gave NSA the
authority to use its considerable foreign intelligence expertise
within this country."  The report noted that such authority was
"particularly troubling" since NSA "has, on occasion, improperly
targeted American citizens for surveillance."
The NET Center proposal, if approved, would constitute a
fundamental re-definition of the relationship between intelligence
agencies and domestic law enforcement.  Such an approach would
ignore 50 years of experience and would pose a serious threat to
the privacy and constitutional rights of Americans.
EPIC looks forward to working with the legislation's sponsors and
other interested parties to address these issues and develop a
national encryption policy that will ensure the widespread
availability of robust encryption products and the preservation of
constitutional rights.  Such a result will be critical for both
our nation's continued leadership of the information industry and
the protection of personal privacy in the next century.
