Greetings all,
    NBC Nightly news recently did a report on the Internet and NII, at the end
of which, they mentioned that they have an Internet address of:
                           news:nightly at nbc.com
They asked for comments regarding the use/misuse of Internet and I'm sure that
they would be thrilled to hear from us.  So drop 'em a line and tell 'em your
opinion of the NII.

Yes, there are others.  Six of these camera systems were installed in
Manhattan, and they have been rumored to have issued more than 250 tickets
per week each!!!  I guess that this means that cops will now have more time
to do other things. (Nab bad guys, eat donuts, etc...)

I prefer to think of myself as a shareholder in our government.  Not that it
is an entity unto itself and that I am "owned" by it.  This may be a little
self-deluding, but it lets me sleep nights.
As to the gov't tracking every penny that I earn, the only alternative to an
income tax is an extremly high sales tax.  This is extremely unfair to those
on the lower end of the wage scale.

Greetings all,
    I've come up with an idea that uses the chaotic nature of fractals to
perform some very secure encryption.  Does anybody know if this has already
been done?  The programs I've already written seem to be very secure.
                                          Any info is appreciated,

I know how to suppress the transmission of your phone number (caller
id) with *67, but I've heard that there is a way to force the routing of
call through multiple long distance companies.  Since the LDCs don't talk
to one another, this should increase the difficulty of tracing and/or
tapping a call.  Does anybody know how to do this?

When "different games" are mentioned, are we talking about any difference
a significant difference.  Are two 1000 move games different just because
they have one move difference, or does the outcome need to be different?
And, bye the outcome being different, does that just mean that the King i

@_subject: Cypherpunk meetings.  The next step. 
SENT 03-13-94 FROM GRABOW_GEOFFREY -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Greetings all,
    Yesterdays meetings brought up some interesting ideas.  Through the fault
of no one, the sound quality of the other locations was somewhat less than
exceptional.  If any of you who attended the other meetings can send out a
summary of what was discussed, I would appreciate it.
    We at the Wash. location were discussing what the next step should be
in the "Clipper vs. Privacy" battle.  Several ideas were brought up:
            - Create our own in-line secure phone encryption device to
                compete with Clipper-designed machines.
            - Increase public awareness of Clipper and what it may bring by
                using methods such as:
                   . Anti-clipper t-shirts, buttons & pins
                   . Anti-clipper memos on any and all BBSs and networks
                   . Anti-clipper letters to the editor of every newspaper
                   . et al
            - Continued polotical wrestling.
Washington attandees: If I've left out anything, please write it down and
                      send it out.

@_subject: Another prong in the attack atainst Clipper. 
SENT 03-20-94 FROM GRABOW_GEOFFREY Greetings c'punks.
    Regarding the discussions at the physical meeting, I'm in the progress
of compiling a list of BBSs in my area.  I plan to walpaper 'em with a letter
about Clipper.  The reason for this is that most average "hacks" have little
or no information about Clipper.  When I chatted with some folks on the BBSs,
many of them didn't know what I was talking about.
    The attack I'm forming uses public awareness.  We need to educate
Joe 6-Pack.  If I tell 100 people, I would hope that 3 of them would become
concerned.  To this end, I'm asking for suggestions for a letter (no more
than 1000 words 'cause people too lazy to read a lot) that explains in
J.6. terms what Clipper is and why it is a thing to be avoided.
    When I get something together, I'll post it for corrections and/or
enhancements.  Then, if everybody on this list posts it on 5 other places,
we might actually get somewhere.
                       I look forward to hearing from y'all,
                                                          G.C.G.

@_subject: Digital cash & multiple spending. 
I work with many institutions that use or create POS systems.
Some of them have gone to using tamper resistant smart cards that
debit themselves and "can't be modified by a user.".  The card has
some keys and some crypto stuff in 'em that only allows authorized
locations (those with the keys) to credit the balance on the card.
It's my understanding that the cards cost around $7 and with care
have a MTBF of 18-24 months.
Additionally, these systems, which are offline, execute batch jobs
at night to compare the spent monies with the balance in the bank's
database.  If anyone has gone over their limit, the card is flagged
and a "HOT" card file is downloaded to the POS locations.  The POS
device will not allow "HOT" cards to be used.  This limits multiple
spending to a 24 hour period.

I asked this a while ago, but my mail system has some problems and
I don't know what the responses were, if any....
    Is there any way to make a phone call anonymously?  Caller ID can be
blocked somewhat with one of those * numbers dialed before the call
is made.  Is there a way to route a call through a series of phone-type
remailer systems?  This would allow one to make a call that would be as
hard to trace as anonymous mail.
    Any ideas?

Thanks for all of the responses.  A friend of mine who works
for a baby bell has been helping me in determining if the suggestions
    As for lassie!jim%lassie at netcom.com's incredibly useless response
and instructions on how to use a pay phone... let me guess... you
just figured out how to use one and now it gives you a special thrill
to inform everyone else.  If you use that lump of gray matter you
call a brain, you'll realize that the purpose of any truly anonymous
system is to reveal NO INFORMATION AT ALL!!!!!  If you use a pay phone,
the location of the phone is available to the phone company before the
call completes.  However, I do not mean to put your idea down...  if
you ever need to make anonymous phone calls to avoid police detection,
(or anyone else for that matter...) please feel free to use a pay phone
and I'll be happy to visit you after you have been arrested.

@_subject: Clipper escrowed keys.  Where's the backup copy? 
With all the talk about the problems with escrowed keys (and there
are plenty of problems) has anybody considered that there must be a
backup set of the keys somewhere?  I can't believe that the gov't would
spend all the time, effort and money and let the only copy of the keys
be accidentally (or on purpose if I get a chance) to destroy the key
database.  Therefore, there must be a backup set somewhere.  Who is
guarding these?  Where are they?  Who has access?  Has anybody heard
anything about this?

@_subject: Bomb information ban 
Bombs are used by building demolition teams, excavation workers and
(believe it or not) there are even a few artists who use explosives to
create their particular brand of art.  I won't even mention 4th of July
fireworks and the creators thereof.
    Granted, not many people fall into these catagories, but does that
mean that the rest of us are entirely un-interested in how they work.
A student of physics might be interested in the physics of a falling
building...  Okay, I reaching, but the possibility exists!

@_subject: Anonymous Long Distance Phone Calling 
The aforementioned method provides only hides who paid for the call.
Couldn't you do the same with a pocket full of coins?  True anonymous
phone calls would have to be routed through several long distance
companies.  Since MCI, Sprint & AT&T don't talk to each other, that
ought to be the best way to hide the caller and callie.
BTW, does anybody have the access phone numbers for any other long
distance companies?

@_subject: 3DES 
I thought it goes like this:
         Eab(x) = Ea(Db(Ea(x)))
