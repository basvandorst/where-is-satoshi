A collation of N-1 nodes will always produce garbage; the whole set is
needed for the message to fall out.
        C wishes to broadcast the number 10.
        A sends   5 to  B
        B sends  11 to  C
        C sends   7 to  D
        D sends  14 to  A
        A sends 14 -  5      =  9 to Central node
        B sends  5 - 11      = -6
        C sends 11 -  7 + 10 = 14
        D sends  7 - 14      = -7
        Central node computes 9 - 6 + 14 - 7 = 10;
        Collating the subset ABC yields 17
        Collating            ABD yields -4
                             ACD yields 16
                             BCD yields  1
What Jim McCoy was talking about (I think: please correct me) was that
there are attacks on this protocol, that can prevent messages from being
transmitted; or alter messages in transit.
Example:  B wants to jam the transmission.  He simply violates the protocol.
        A sends 14 -  5      =  9 to Central node
        B sends  5 - 11 +  8 =  2 (the +8 is static)
        C sends 11 -  7 + 10 = 14
        D sends  7 - 14      = -7
Now the message sums up to 18, instead of 10 as C intended.
Worse than that;  If B knows that 10 is going to be broadcast, he can force
the message to be any value he wants, by properly choosing his jamming
There's an even nastier trick you can play with the vanilla DC protocol.
Two adjacent members can conspire to set up a 3rd.  Let's say the DC Cell
gets busted by the Feds for posting the illegal number 10 to the Internet.
The guilty party is C, but C and D can lie about the number they shared and
make it look like A.
C testifies, "I received an 11 from B and sent a -3 to D"
D testifies, "I received  a  3 from C and sent a  4 to A"
That makes A's calculation look off by 10, the number of the message.
A testifies, "You liar! You gave me 14!"
Who's lying?
I'm not sure is these constitute bugs or "features" of the DC protocol;
since the goal is to obscure the source of the message, allowing jammers
and spoofers may preserve plausible deniability at the cost of network
reliability;  then again, maybe I'm just being lazy.
You have violated Robot's Rules of Order and will be asked to leave the
future immediately.  Thank You.

@_subject: (Fwd)      news spoke 
(by John Young)
This text is taken almost verbatim from CERT Advisory CA-92:19.  The idea
behind it is to protect systems operators from lawsuits if they monitor the
keystrokes of a hacker breaking into their system.  It's quoted in Cheswick
and Bellovin's _Firewalls_and_Internet_Security_ (a totally cool book BTW).
They quote from the case _United States_v._Seidlitz_ 589 F.2d 152 (4th Cir.
1978) where the defendant claimed that keystroke monitoring of his attempt
to break into OSI's computer constituted an illegal wiretap.  The judge
blew him off, of course.
If you're worried that this boiler plate legalese gives them carte blanche
to listen in on your IRC sessions on  then forget it.  It
(_probably_) doesn't.

@_subject: Mac Encryption Components? 
Does anybody know if there is an encryption component registered with
Apple? I was planning to write one, but I wanted to know if there was
already a standard/spec I could code to.  I e-mailed REGISTRY at AppleLink
a coupla weeks ago, but they seem to be focussed just on registering new
components; not fielding queries about what's already registered.
