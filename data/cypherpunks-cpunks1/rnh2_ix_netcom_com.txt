Unless someone in the U.S. is willing to go to the effort of capturing all
of the packets that comprise the crypto software package as they pass
through various MCI, Sprint, etc. networks (which is probably illegal in
itself, in most cases), on their way from the UK to your site in Australia
and then reassembling them in the U.S. into something that is in violation
of the export regulations, what difference does the path of the individual
packets make?

Is it possible the unreasonable crypto export restrictions are simply being
imposed at this time for the purpose of making Al Gore look good when he
runs for President in 2000?
In other words, his campaign could include promises to retract existing
crypto export restrictions established by his predecessor. The campaign
would be accompanied by slogans and rhetoric such as "export crypto, not
jobs" and the crypto/high-tech community would support Gore and the
Democratic party in droves.

I agree the strategy would have to be hijack-proof.  Something like Gore
experiencing a convenient "change of heart" towards the end of this current
term and convincing Clinton and the administration to soften crypto export
restrictions which would make Gore look like a hero to the high-tech
community just in time for the election. Naturally this would have to be
carefully scripted but the objective would be to keep the democrats in power.
Just a theory.
