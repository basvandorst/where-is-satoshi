Doesn't domestic surveillance of civilian cel-phone calls, without a warrant, fall into a really "Gray"[1] area? I thought NSA wasn't permitted to do that...
[1] For suitably dark and illegal values of gray

But the news was reporting about looking for "people who were on the planes calling friends and family" (e.g., other people like that Olson woman on Flt. 93), ... if they're recording THOSE calls then there's a serious question raised of "why".

To my knowledge, no. FBI confiscated the 911 tapes yesterday for analysis and investigation, and wouldn't even confirm that the 911 call had taken place... CNN mentioned that yesterday.

But why should it have to be "for law enforcement purposes"? Is the LEO somehow "less capable of handling his firearm properly" because he's not travelling to LGA to pick up a prisoner?

There's a distinct difference in purpose, theoretically speaking, between "invading to control" and "invading to punish and destroy".
Your operational requirements are significantly different, so I'm told by several military folks I've talked to, none of whom attempted to play down the Afghan resolve, but simply pointed out that if we didn't care about "keeping it", we would not encounter (all of) the same difficulties Ivan did.

@_subject: Readers Digest poll - vote now 
Readers Digest and Yahoo are sponsoring a poll that asks various questions about what freedoms people are willing to sacrifice...
Hitting up public opinion for bad policies in a time of sorrow is wrong, in my opinion, and its important that all sides get their voices heard on this topic.
