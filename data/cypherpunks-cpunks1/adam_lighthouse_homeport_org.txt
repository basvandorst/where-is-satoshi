have keys automatically deprecitated some time before they are due to

comprimised.  The user might not be aware that the key is comprimised.
Better to have an unchangeable date.  (On a more technical level,
allowing users to change the expiry date on a key means that the key's
expiry date is not signed by the signatories, and an opponent who
comprimised a key could simply change the expiry date on that key and

overseas is expensive, and there is a high service fee.  Reducing the

@_subject: Statistical analysis of anonymous databases 
One solution to this is to have a database that 'generalizes' its
answers as it provides them.  For example, rather than returning Clay Olbon, 32, m, left handed, cholesterol 350, bp 200/160, 5'9", 175 it would return:
fooblat martin,25-35, m, left handed, cholest. 3-400, 5.5-6ft, heavy.
researchers could then provide ranges to get answers.  Thus, if I'm
very concerned about the correlation between age and weight, I could
get that information very specifically and nothing else.
The generalization filter could be written to only allow N queries of
a given level of detail, so that the more detail you wanted in one
area, the more you give up in others.
There could be a review comittee (This is the way hospitals & medical
research works) to review requests for more specific data.
