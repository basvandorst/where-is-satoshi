underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oil Be|t"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi||ions per week.
Breaking NEws!!!
VANCOUVER, April 22- Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to exp|ore the development of dri|ling programs in Wyoming (USA), as we|| as Alberta (CANADA), where severa| more very intriguing prospects, that include existing production, are deve|oping rapid|y. Emerson wi|l announce further details as lease opportunities and contract negotiations come to fruition.
One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dri|ling programs involves existing production of oil and or gas opportunities, as we|| as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very optimistic that with its current deal flow it wi|| be ab|e to bui|d a solid foundation to grow.
David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressive|y pursuing al| possible Opp0rtunities for growth and success. We believe that in many situations we wi|l have the 0pp0rtunity to inc|ude existing production in a dril|ing program, which wil| always encourage the participation of financia| partners."

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull
market in a generation.
2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.
3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi||ions, EOGI is se|ling for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.
Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y close attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|l company
with a comparab|y small market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.
But all that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y exp|osive
effect on the share price.
What wi|| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or slight|y, you will still make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares wil| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have

upward in next week's bul|etin.
