Well, then.  Maybe it's time to develop our own PGP chip.  Would the
PGP routines fit in a large PGA?  What's the smallest, cheapest alternative
we can come up with?  If we give away the PGA code freely, that would
help reduce the cost of inclusion in a commercial product.  An FPGA would give the user the ability to change keys with little trouble.  Upgrading
is as easy as swapping a prom.  (Better yet have an onboard programmer.)
Even then, I would guess that a lot of people would have to pay a bit more
for secure communications.  I think it's worth it.
