You like that zillion word when you can't quantify something.
C'mon Nathan.  It was in the Received headers generated at your  end.  I agree that it COULD have happened on our end, but it didn't.   I've never seen anybody with such an arrogant attitude.  BTW, it  looks like it has been fixed now.  :-b

But how does this affect the use of Notes for US companies with  foreign offices?  If foreign offices are required to use the "export  version" (which IS supposedly interoperable with the domestic  version), then Notes use between a foreign office and US office will  have a 40 bit key as far as the government is concerned.  This  assumption may be incorrect, but until I know what the effective key  size is as seen by the government when the export and domestic  versions communicate, I have to assume that the export version will  have to dominate the effective key length.  In other words, the  domestic version will be able to handle and generate keys with the  24 government accesible bits, but naturally, keys generated by the  domestic version will not be usable by the export version.
Are US businesses willing to swallow this when the use is purely  internal to the company?  Does the national security argument hold  up in this situation?
This really does so little to improve the security situation that I  can see why Mr. Ozzie is not comfortable with this compromise as  anything but a short-term solution.  I hope his statement is  sincere.  I'm asking a lot of questions at this point because my own  opinions are not fully formed on all of the relevant issues.

[ An impressive amount of tripe ]
Nathaniel, go away.  You botha us.
Any useful information in your anouncement is already well-known.   The rest of it is alarmist and self-serving.  There have been  several excellent posts pointing out the flaws in your arguments.
BTW, I took a look at the FV web page.  While checking out the  information section I had a bad flashback to one of those late night  infomercials on "buying and selling."  Looks cut from the same  mold.  Truly sad.
Until I actually see an advisory from CERT, I'll just have to  assume they told FV to go take a flying leap.  I certainly hope they  have enough integrity to ignore this.
Hmm..  Did I just hear the sound of Nathaniel Borenstein and  * being added to ZILLIONS :-) of killfiles and filter  I thought I did.

I count numbers 1, 2 and 3 as one way (Trojan Horse).
If you can break in that far, I can think of much more imaginative  things to do with the access.
Again, 4 and 5 are the same as 1,2 and 3.  (I thought I smelled  horse biscuits.)
Insultingly obvious.
YATH (Yet Another Trojan Horse)
Yes.  Trojan Horse.  Whinny. Neigh.
Ahh, finally something other than a Trojan Horse attack, but it  only affects sites with poor security.  In that case, this attack is  the least of their problems.
Wow, a whole three different attacks and most of them much more  useful for things other than gathering credit card numbers.
It's sad to think that a lot of people may actually believe this  crap.  Let's just hope that enough technical users provide rebuttals  in the other fora where this stuff appears.

How about a NEXTSTEP port?  Didn't think so.

Interesting address that was used to reach me.
Somehow, both reached me from within their system, but if they  can't configure their e-mail to show the proper address than I don't  have to much faith in their other abilities.  I don't imagine that  anybody else would have much luck replying to either of those or CAN  I now receive mail at nsb.fv.com?  Is this a new free service  provided by FV?

I should have suspected as much.  Hello robot.  Nice robot.  Busy  Busy Nathaniel.
You gotta be kidding.  I just gotta see the response from this one.
I can most assuredly aver that my comments and questions were not  covered in the NSB FAQ. ;-)
