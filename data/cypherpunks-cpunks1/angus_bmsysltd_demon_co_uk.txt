It's a sad fact that many unscrupulous(sp?) writers of WWW pages use non-visilble "on load" HTML to record what the web browser thinks the email address of the person browsing the page, and, I presume sell this info to the junk email producers.
Part of the WhoWhere archives could have come from such sources. (personally my address in netscape is stop.stealing at addresses.you.CENSORED)
If one really set ones mind to it, I guess that grepping through mailing list archives for addresses, and using a webcrawler to search for MAILTO=
would lead to many thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of addresses.
On the plus side, the search engine will not let "*","\*","?*" and so be used, and there are no real matches for "root", apart from stuff like "Bob Root" etc.
