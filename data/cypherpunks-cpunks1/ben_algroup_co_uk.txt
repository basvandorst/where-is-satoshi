Chambers defines geodesic as "the shortest line on a surface between two
points on it" and that is precisely the meaning in general relativity.
Saying that it has anything to do with distributed systems is making it
up as you go along.
And if RAH is now going to claim that's what he meant then he's making
it up as he goes along, too (well, we knew that anyway, but redefining
geodesic in this way is going too far).

Not being subscribed to cypherpunks (has S/R improved?) I will have
missed that.
:-) Certainly not. AFAIK, RAH has always used "geodesic" in conjuction
with "settlement", which clearly says to me that he's talking about the
quickest/easiest way to do money transfer. You may, or may not, achieve
that with distributed systems, but so what?
And, to hit relativity, for completeness, geodesic in that sense is
about figuring out curvature. That is, knowing all geodesics tells you
the shape of space-time. And, natch, light follows geodesics, which is
the glue that holds it all together (and brings in your non-instaneous
transfer, too, but again, that is neither a consequence of, nor a
requirement for, geodesics).
I'm taking the fifth on that one.

The list I'm writing to is not censored, AFAIK.
Actually, they're really about geometry, though there are some kinds of
topology which can support geodesics (not the standard rubber-sheet kind
most people are familiar with, though). For example, a graph can support
the notion of a shortest distance between two points, and that is
definitely a topological entity.

I don't have time right now to comment in detail (I will try to later), but it seems to me that, as someone else commented, relying on operators to not keep logs is really not the way to go. If you want privacy or anonymity, then you have to create it for yourself, not expect others to provide it for you.
Of course, it is possible to reduce your exposure to others whilst still taking advantage of privacy-enhancing services they offer. Two obvious examples of this are the mixmaster anonymous remailer network, and onion It seems to me if you want to make serious inroads into privacy w.r.t. logging of traffic, then what you want to put your energy into is onion routing. There is _still_ no deployable free software to do it, and that is ridiculous[1]. It seems to me that this is the single biggest win we can have against all sorts of privacy invasions.
Make log retention useless for any purpose other than statistics and maintenance. Don't try to make it only used for those purposes.

@_subject: double-spending prevention w. spent coins (Re: 
Blinded coins prevent the server from knowing which IP address they are
issued to (that is, it knows it issued _a_ coin to the address, but it
doesn't know which one). When it sees an unblinded coin, yes, it knows
which IP address that is presented by, but since it doesn't know who had
it in the first place, that doesn't help. Of course, the unblinded coin
is immediately replaced by a blinded one, thus restarting the cycle.
Errr - so how do you get money into the system in the first place? Note
that blinded coins solve this issue, too - the server can have a list of
where all the money came from in the first place, but after that it
knows nothing.

They were only invented recently, and indeed, I've been planning to introduce them to the camram arena. I wonder if they're being discussed as a result of the pub conversation I had recently with a Microsoft person on this very subject?
One major advantage of memory-based proof-of-work over hashcash is that the variation between machines is much smaller (estimated to be a factor of 4 from slowest to fastest PCs, for example).
BTW, for those who don't know, SpamAssassin now supports hashcash.

Such a machine cannot exist. Proof:
Let O be an oracle such that any encrypted message, E can be decrypted
by O. That is, if E=Enc(M), then O(E)=M. Now, encrypt a message I as
If bit 0 of I (I_0) is 1, then choose E_0 s.t. the MS bit of O(E_0)=0
If bit 0 of I is 0, then choose E_0 s.t. the MS bit of O(E_0)=1
Then for each subsequent bit, proceed as follows:
If I_n is 1, then choose E_n s.t. O(E_n||E_{n-1}||...E_0) has an MS
bit that is 0.
If I_n is 0, then choose E_n s.t. O(E_n||E_{n-1}||...E_0) has an MS
bit that is 1.
Then the encrpytion of I is X=E_N||E_{N-1}...||E_0, and, by
construction, O(X) != I.

Actually, Lucre uses the double-blinding method to avoid this. The paper
discusses the ZK proof as an alternate way of doing it, but I chose not
to use it because of its potential interpretation as a blind signature.
There is an implementation of the ZK proof included in Lucre just for
fun, though.

@_subject: lucre double-blinding? (Re: Crypto-making vs 
Lucre coins can _only_ be verified by the bank. However, only the payee
needs to be talking to the bank (the payer gives the payee an unblinded
coin), and can, at their own risk, defer that conversation (the risk
being a double-spend, of course). Double-blinding refers to a method
using two blinding factors, not any other weird combination you might
have thought of :-)

The bank, of course, has to choose a withdrawer to tag, or a small
subset of withdrawers, or this doesn't work. Note that the depositor is
not tagged, the withdrawer is. And if the withdrawer has simply done an
exchange anonymously, nor is she.
Why would they fail? Since the bank cannot tell its own junk signature
from the invented junk signatures, the bank would have to honour these
requests. This sounds to me like a bank that is going bust fast.
If a bank wants to cheat, it can do so despite a ZK proof - it simply
refuses to cash the coins - claiming, for example, a double-spend, or
just saying "no". So, given that marking coins with junk signatures is:
a) Only effective if you want to mark a small subset
b) Costs you a fortune if anyone finds out you are doing it,
I am not entirely convinced by this argument. Nevertheless, the ZK
option is implemented in Lucre (and documented in the paper) should any
mint wish to use it.

2-factor blinding might be a better way to express it.
As I mentioned in another post, the bank either has to reveal its
subterfuge, or honour forged coins, so I'm not convinced. Anyway, the ZK
proof is available if you want to use it.

proof-of-delivery protocols might help (but they're patented, as I discovered when I reinvented them a few years back).
Simultaneous release is (provably?) impossible without a trusted third I think this is one of the interesting applications of capabilities. Using them, you can have a TTP who is ignorant of what is running - you and your vendor agree some code that the TTP will run, using capability based code. In your case, this code would verify the eGold payment and the code (difficult to do this part with certainty, of course) and release them when both were correct. Because of the capabilities, the TTP could run the code without fear, and you would both know that it performed the desired function, but neither of you could subvert it.

Would do if it were true - this is exactly why unblinded lucre coins have structure - that is, you can check that they are well-formed by doing hash operations on them. Blinded coins will fail these checks.
I forget the exact form of lucre coins (read the paper), but consider the construction x || H(x) - clearly only the unblinded version of this will have the right form.

Do they exist? Certainly any session ID I've ever had a hand in has two properties that strongly resist session fixation:
a) If a session ID arrives, it should already exist in the database.
b) Session IDs include HMACs.
Session fixation is defeated by either of these. Modulo insider attacks, of course. :-)

But this is trivial. Since the traffic is encrypted, you just have a bit
that says "this is garbage" or "this is traffic".
OTOH, this can leave you open to traffic marking attacks. George Danezis

attacks by making all packets meaningful. You can find it here:
