@_subject: Destroying Data (Re: Remailer Policies) 
this will zero out the inode it also does NOT clear the data blocks
just the inode pointers to the data blocks. infact if you do this.
(this you *will* need to umnount and fsck your
system [or reboot if you did this to you root partition]).
in fact if you do this with out deleteing the file first you run a good
chance of crashing the system.
normaly I would say "do not try this at home" but then I would rather
you shot yourself in the foot at home (as opposed to shooting yourself
and who ever is on a public system)
I will post some C/Perl code that will work as a /bin/rm replacement in a
few days.

@_subject: random numbers (resend) 
[my first send bounced so I am resending]
Here is some code to run on a SparcStaion (I or II) to generate random
numbers based on noise from the audio chip.  I have not tested the true
randomness of the out but cause I don't know how.  Thus if anyone can
please do and send me the results.  I suppose some minor tweeking can be
made for the mid range gain for a better spread. unfortunatly there is no way to turn off the u-law audio compression
the chip uses to outputs data if you plot the out put you will see the
problem the compression caused.

@_subject: one time pads 
To add my two cents, I once had some sensitive files solen from me.
the cracker had modified the crypt command to record passwords
and current directory (since crypt only works on stdin and stdout).
In a matter of a few days they have my crypt password and enough infomation
from my file to raise some real hell.  Note that they did not bother with breaking the crypt or guessing the password
they just rigged the system binaries.
PS: this happend a year ago, and last  month a copy of the files
    appeared on some systems owned by the Bay Area Air Quality Management
    District in SF (baaqmd).

I have written on a possible random number source for Sun SparcStations
(I and II).  I have a program programs the audio chip to take input from
mic port 2 (which is not used in a SparcStation) then I turn up the
gain in the pre-amps and  read the data of the from the DtoA.
I do not know how random it is yet (if anyone wants to run some tests
for me I will be happy to email them the program)

my office mate and I were talking along simular lines, but for DOS. we

like the product "stacker" or  "double disk". but instead of just compressing
we encrypt.    When the system boots it will ask for a password phrase, it
you do not provide on the disk will not me accessable  (it will just appear
to be a unformated partition).   Thus when you are raided and they power down your system, they will loose
access to the date.
