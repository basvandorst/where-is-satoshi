Will return on 10/11.  Check with Kevin Deeley if you need an immediate
so that if I suddenly get the Irresistable Urge to [Imaging *Your*
WorstNighMare Here], I know that I will either have to wait for Martin's
return date, or [I*Y*WNH] Kevin...
OfCourseOfCourse [TM], this SpyStalk Feature of Micro$not'S eMail
product will provide PerseProseCuting Attorneys with ValuableEvidence in
Court Cases where RealEvidence is lacking, but this is of little import
in light of the fact that CyberStalking Laws will no doubt soon be in
place that make sending or receiving email a Federal Crime.
(Don't worry, I'm sure they'll only prosecute the *BAD* guys, eh?)
