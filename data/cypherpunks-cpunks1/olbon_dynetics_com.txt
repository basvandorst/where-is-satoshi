@_subject: [NOISE] Consolidation of threads ... 
OK, I have a proposal that consolidates two threads that have been
discussed recently.  How about proposing legislation that mandates that a
byte is now 9 bits instead of 8.  This would allow the ninth bit to be the
decent/indecent bit, thereby solving all of our problems.

At 8:25 AM 2/1/96, pj ponder wrote (much elided):
A few psueudorandom points regarding this post:
        First, it seems silly to implement a separate standard that only
works for the credit card number.  What about the privacy of the rest of
the info (what I am ordering, how much, etc.).
        Can (or will) this be layered with Netscape's SSL?
        How is this to be implemented?  It sounds like the merchants will
just pass the encrypted number to the credit card company.  If this is the
case, key management could become an issue.  I suppose this could easily be
implemented using public key crypto, but only DES was mentioned.  If only
DES is used and everyone uses the same DES key, that would be a valuable
key to break!
        How about a MITM attack.  Get the encrypted credit card  and
change the purchase amount, delivery info, etc if that is not encrypted.
If there is anyone on the list with more info on this, I would love to hear
it (heopfully we will hear something from Netscape, since they are quoted
in the article).  From what I know so far, it seems like a poor compromise.

@_subject: Fair Credit Reporting Act and Privacy Act 
In discussions regarding privacy of personal information, Tim Philp has
advocated a "privacy law" similar to those in Europe.  My response is - why
do we always need a law to protect ourselves?  Nowadays the first solution
always appears to be run to mommy govt and ask for help.  In this case
there is clearly the potential for market based solutions.  The problem now
is that there is almost no market!  If people were truly interested in
privacy, there would be a "privacy credit card" and "privacy health care"
that refused to give out information except upon the approval of the
individual concerned.  Once people become interested in their privacy, I
think these sorts of things will appear.
A place where laws are clearly applicable however is in limiting the amount
and type of info the government can gather.
my 2 cents,
        Clay

@_subject: Article on CAs in WebWeek 
An article on the front page of WebWeek this week discusses digital
signatures and CAs.  The best point made was that a small company could
undercut (pricewise) the post office as a CA.  Overall it seemed a pretty
fair article.
It mentioned UC Berkeley researchers "spoofing" a Netscape server's
identity and sending false data to the client.  This was news to me, I am
curious as to how this was done.
The paper article also listed as a "resource on the net" the URL for Tim
May's cyphernomicon.
Here's the link.  Enjoy.

There is one potential side-benefit to the V-chip -- The inverse-V-chip
(the idea for which I stole from someone on this list, sorry I don't
remember who to credit).
I am looking forward to a time when I will never, even accidentally, have
my TV tuned to "Full House" ;-)

@_subject: Subject lines? 
Ok, has everyone forgotten to use a subject line today, or is there a
problem with toad.com?  Every message I received today that was dated 14
Feb (except one - from "E. ALLEN SMITH" )
had no subject and no from line (other than cypherpunks).  This includes
messages from Perry and Jim Bell.

@_subject: Linux on the Mac 
In the latest PowerPC news it is reported that OSF is porting Linux to the
Mac with the support of Apple.  Apple has a web site -
 that discusses this and has a link to the OSF site.
In my book, this is a GoodThing(tm).  Of course, being a huge fan of both
the Mac and unix might put me in the minority ;-)

@_subject: Internet Privacy Guaranteed ad (POTP Jr.) 
Given that N is the length of the message in bits. The number of
possible combinations of bits is 2^N.  For any message length N > 1,
2^N < N^256.  Simple example.  Message length is 3 bits.  The maximum
number of possible combinations of these bits is 8.  This is far less than
3^256 (which is more than 10^100, i.e. it overflows the calculator on my
Mac).  Sorry guys.  Try learning some simple math before you try and sell

Oops.  Thanks for pointing this out.  I should probably just shut up about
this, but snake-oil salesmen really get under my skin.  Of course, being
wrong hasn't kept me from opening my mouth in the past so ...

@_subject: Key Expiration (was: Revoking Old Lost Keys) 
Numerous people over that last few days have suggested key expiration dates.
 Viacrypt advertises this for their commercial version of pgp.  Has anyone
used this feature or know how it works (i.e. how does it remain
interoperable with other versions of pgp, or does the expiration feature
only work with other viacrypt users?)

@_subject: Crippled Notes export encryption 
Better idea: replace des_encrypt() with fuck_the_itar().
Seriously, this just illustrates the idiocy of banning "hooks" in software.
How does one define a "hook"?  Just providing source code could be defined
as providing a hook, since a good programmer could then modify it to do
crypto.  Also, how about the various kits and tools used to integrate pgp
with pine, eudora, etc -- are these not "hooks"?

@_subject: Signed posts (was Re: FV ... Fatal Flaw ...) 
Amidst all of the  about the "fatal flaw", Mr. Scarenstein brings up
(amazingly) an interesting point regarding signed posts that I have wondered
about for a while.
At 5:30 PM 1/29/96, Nathaniel Borenstein wrote (highly edited!):
The issue of knowing that a signed post belongs to a particular individual
has come up often.  Clearly the best approach is verifying the key in person
  Failing that, however, I have adopted a strategy of maximizing the
probablility that the key actually belongs to me.  I do this by:
        1.  Including the fingerprint and where to get the key in my
            signed post (within the pgp sig)
        2.  Putting the key in a fairly secure place (i.e. on a machine
            controlled by my employer, but where I can check the key
            periodically
        3.  Putting the same key on the keyservers
I could (and should) also place it on my web page as well.
This is not to say that someone could not impersonate me by creating a key
and placing it in all of these places, but I think it would be difficult,
and probably not worth the effort.  I am not real worried about this threat
(but heck, if someone really wants to impersonate me, I'd be flattered).
I think these measures are probably sufficient for a mailing list level of
discussion.  Any comments? (flames >/dev/null)
