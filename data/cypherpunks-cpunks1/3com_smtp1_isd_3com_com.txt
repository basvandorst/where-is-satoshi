Well, hieroglyphics and linear b are writing systems, not languages.
And Linear B is Greek (though it takes effort to read it even if
you know your Homer...)

Well, I know the writing system is different, and knowing the greek alphabet is no help at all, but that in itself is of no significance.  What is
of significance is that the syllabic writing system forces the words into
somewhat peculiar forms (exactly as in Japanese transliterations of
English words).  Furthermore the language is several centuries older
than Homer, so you have to deal with assorted archaisms.  Then again,
if you know even a little of ancient greek linguistics, it gets easier.
My greek is all high school level and yet I can figure out some of
the Minoan stuff.
There's a book on the subject: Chadwick, "The decypherment of
Linear B".  Neat.  The particularly fascinating part about it is that
no Rosetta stone was needed -- and indeed if one were found now
it would merely serve to confirm the decypherment, not really to add
anything to it.
Linear A looks a whole lot like Linear B but as far as I know has not
yet been decyphered and is believed to be a completely different
language (I think the guess is some Semitic language but absent
a decypherment that remains speculation).  I don't think it is any more
ideographic.  There is a third writing system from the same area
that has a hieroglyphic look to it (pictures) and is also undecyphered
as far as I know.  I think Chadwick has details, if not look in the
recently published "The world's writing systems" by Daniels & Bright, Oxford U. Press, 1995, ISBN 0-19-507993-0.  Great book!
Well, Sanskrit is usually written with Devanagiri, same as Hindi, so that's
all covered.  If you want to write it with Siddham characters, there are
proposals for that but I don't think they have gone all that far.  I have
also seen discussions about hieroglyphics, again not beyond the
proposal stage as far as I can recall.
Talk to Rick McGowan (Rick_McGowan  @ NeXT.Com), he's the
driving force behind efforts to put all the obscure, obsolete, and
archaic scripts into Unicode.  I know he has a proposal for
Linear B, complete with encodings of each character...

Nice april fools article...  After all, position information is nothing more than a particular
phase shift (time delay) between GPS data streams received
from the set of satellites overhead.  If I report the datastreams
received -- or information about them -- then someone can
calculate where I am.  (Indeed, there are GPS applications
where the device whose position is of interest doesn't actually
decode the GPS data, it merely reports what it receives to some
central data collection site, where the arithmetic is done.)
If I want to pretend to be somewhere else, all I have to do is
some simple geometry to calculate the time delays I want to
report, and then phase-shift the GPS streams from their
received position to where they would be at the other place.
Note that relying on the PP code (military code) in the GPS
stream is no help, since I don't need to be able to interpret
the PP stream in order to pretend to be elsewhere, I merely
need to know where I am and where I want to be, to insert
the right phase shift.

@_subject: questions about bits and bytes 
Not so.
It appears that the term "byte" originated in the IBM 360, where
it is indeed 8 bits.  And certainly all present day computers use
"byte" to refer to an octet and not to any other size.  That has not
always been true.
The CDC 6000 series used 6-bit characters, though those weren't
usually referred to as "byte".  On the other hand, on the PDP10
there were "byte instructions" which would operate on an arbitrary
piece of the (36-bit) word.  On that machine, "bytes" when used to
store characters were often 9 bits long.  That's where things like
"meta" and "alt" started, see the Hacker's Dictionary.

@_subject: No matter where you go, there they are. 
No, the situation is better than that.
Here's how GPS works (loosely): you have four unknowns (not three):
x, y, z, and the current time.  You have signals from four satellites
reporting their x, y, z, t.  Using suitable math you construct four equations
in four unknowns, and presto, you get your four answers.
Why is time one of the unknowns?  Because your receiver only has
a rough idea of what time it is.  Remember that a microsecond offset
amounts to a 300 meter (1000 foot) displacement.  So a side effect of
GPS position measurement is accurate time measurement.  (Some
GPS receivers turn this around, and make delivering accurate time
their primary task.  They get accurate position as a side effect.)
Suppose I want to pretend that I am 1000 feet closer to satellite 4 than I really am.  Simple, I take the signals from all the other satellites
and delay them by 1 microsecond.  That looks like a 1 microsecond
local timebase error together with a 1 microsecond delay reduction
to satellite 4.
Yes, the checking station in this purported scheme would also listen
to the satellites.  That doesn't help at all.  It could detect that I replayed
a signal from a minute ago (unless I substitute the correct time codes,
which wouldn't be hard since they are predictable).  But there is no
need to do that and indeed it's probably easier not to.    In the description
of the article, the "signature" [sic] is sent to the checker over some
sort of comm link, which has a latency likely to be several milliseconds
or more, plus jitter of many microseconds.  If I'm a healthy distance
away from the target (say, 20 miles) that means I have to introduce an
offset of at most 100 microseconds.  If I do that in real time -- which is
no big deal -- then the checker basically has to be capable of
detecting 100 microsecond delays in the authentication data it is
getting.  And if I'm willing to be closer to the lion's den -- say, a block
or two away -- then I only need at most a one microsecond delay.
Incidentally, differential GPS is not an issue (re Peter's question).
GPS relies on knowing accurately the position and time at each satellite and the speed of light in between.  DGPS lets you correct
for errors in these.  The idea is simple: if you're close to a "reference
station", then the errors are essentially the same for both.  The
reference station is at a precisely known place, so it can look at where
the satellites claim it is, and deduce from that how much error there is
on the signal from each satellite.  It tells you, and you subtract out those
errors.  So while DGPS lets you get better accuracy, it doesn't
interfere with your ability to fool the CyberLocator scheme.

@_subject: No matter where you go, there they are. 
Yes, that was my initial reaction too, but the content just don't support that.
I suspect this is a case of a person well-qualified in one area (crypto)
working in very different area (GPS) where she is not qualified and does
not understand what is going on.
Well, sort of.  The satellites are up at 11,000 miles, which makes for a large
footprint.  You'd certainly see most of the same satellites from several
states away.
Right, that's what several of us have been saying.
Sure, but that is nonsense.  Here's why.
The time delay you need to introduce a 200 mile shift is 1 ms.  The effects
Denning et al. are talking about are LOW FREQUENCY effects.  This is
obvious for orbital perturbations, since we're talking about small motions of
large heavy objects here, and it is also true for the S/A dither. Indeed
it has to be that way, since any high frequency jitter would prevent the
receiver from locking on the spread spectrum code that's at the core of
how GPS works.  In other words, at the millisecond  level, none of those effects exist.
Re Hal's comments:
What a checking system actually observes is: at time T2 it receives
a message that claims to have been generated at time T1 by a system
at location X.  It would accept the authentication as valid if the elapsed
time T2-T1 is small enough to be believable.  How small this is depends
on (a) the transmission latency, (b) the processing delay in X and in
the checker.  There are two flavors of attack on this:
1. Attacker Y uses the real-time signals from the satellites, delayed as
needed.  It sends those after processing, just as X would have done
(except that X doesn't insert the processing delay).  The elapsed time
seen by the checker differs from the case of X by the sum of the
processing delay and the incremental transmission latency (since Y
is at a different place than X, so its connection to the checker may have
either less or more latency).
This fools the checker if the incremental latency is within its tolerance.
Suppose that I'm using a LAN -- in that case a transmit delay on the
order of 1 ms is plausible.  X and Y would be about the same (of course
it has hard for Y to get on the LAN unobserved...).  If X is less than
20 miles away, the processing delay is under 100 microseconds, which
is "in the noise".
If I'm in a WAN, then the latency is likely to be greater, but even if is is
1 ms, I can be many miles away before it becomes obvious.
The above of course assumes that the signal processing is done in
hardware (or fast DSP) so it can indeed be done in well under 1 ms.
Not a big deal...  That seems to be one Denning mistake, the thinking
only of replay in the sense of long delayed spoofing messages.
2. Attacker Y synchronizes to the satellites but constructs a signal
locally that effectively "anticipates" what the satellite is about to send.
This allows it to get the effect of a negative delay (thus avoiding
the "node in the ground" problem).  Since the signal is entirely
predictable at the few-ms level, this is not difficult, though it requires
a bit more effort than the simple delay approach.  This way Y can
construct a signal acceptable to the checker, even if its transmit latency
to the checker is greater than it is for X.  It simply anticipates by
the difference plus whatever it needs to fake the position.
As Hal also pointed out, if the system allows users to have partial
sky view, then the attacker can avoid the need for negative delays
entirely by selecting satellites closer to him than to the legitimate
For anyone interested in an intro to GPS, Trimble (one of the leading
companies in the industry) puts out some skinny paperbacks
with nice clear explanations.  They sometimes are a bit at
the "see Spot run" level, but they do have the correct story.

@_subject: No matter where you go, there they are. 
In the case of the C/A (civilian) code, absolutely.  In the case of the
P code (military) only if you have the key, but in that case, yes.
As Jim Bell pointed out, there are boxes you can buy for
suitable amounts of money that are "GPS simulators" -- they construct
out of whole cloth the signals you would receive if you were at
location X with satellites {Y1, Y2, ...} overhead.
However, if all you set out to do is fool a location authenticator,
deriving shifted location data from the actual satellites is far
easier and bound to be much cheaper.  There is one limitation
this has that the simulator approach doesn't -- delaying real signals
requires having access to the same satellites (or a large enough
subset, i.e., 3-4 of them) that the checking station has overhead.

Fine, but that doesn't address the point missed by the original
article, which is that you don't need to precompute this stuff.
It's easy to compute in real time (under a second) which
eliminates the perturbations issue.  You don't need to worry
about inability to predict those if you're not predicting but
rather measuring/correcting in real time.

Huh?  I don't follow your reasoning.
If you use two random words, the search space for a dictionary attack
with an N word dictionary is N^2.  That's true whether you include a space
or leave it out.  If you use "random punctuation" and the punctuation
character is unknown, you add perhaps a factor 20, which is so much smaller
than N that it isn't worth arguing about.
Two-word passphrases are pretty good, and if you feel uncomfortable
with an N^2 work factor, use three words to get N^3.  That's a much bigger
win than talking about random punctuation characters.
