Use an etch-a-sketch. Etch-a-sketch displays are not vulnerable to
power-line denial-of-service attacks or fires. They *are* vulnerable to data
loss during earthquakes or if physical access is obtained, however most
operating systems running on standard hardware are also vulnerable to
attacks of this nature. They are not vulnerable to remote electronic
eavesdropping, as they emit no power signature, in fact no emissions of any
kind. I am not familiar with TEMPEST specifications, however, and can not
claim this level of security.
