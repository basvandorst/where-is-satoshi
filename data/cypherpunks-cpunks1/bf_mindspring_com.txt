          Bloomberg, Internet Wire Sued Over
          Emulex
          By Nicole Volpe
          NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Florida investor has filed a lawsuit
          against Internet Wire and Bloomberg LP over a false press
          release that led to a nosedive in the shares of Emulex Corp.
          (NasdaqNM:EMLX - news) last week in one of the biggest
          Web-based financial hoaxes ever, attorneys said on Friday.
          The suit, filed on behalf of retiree Ron Hart and which seeks
          class action status, accuses the two organizations of
          ``recklessly disseminating materially false and misleading
          information,'' Hartford, Conn.-based law firm Schatz & Nobel
          said in a statement. Hart lost as much as $15,000 as a result
          the hoax, said Schatz partner Andrew Schatz.
          Both Internet Wire, a company announcement distribution
          service, and Bloomberg, a financial information and news
          company, declined to comment on the suit, which was filed in
          the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
          ``We have not been served so we do not have a comment until
          we are,'' said Internet Wire spokeswoman Amy Orebaugh on
          Friday.
          Bloomberg spokeswoman Chris Taylor said that as of early
          Friday morning it had not been served a lawsuit and said the
          company does not comment on ongoing litigation.
          A false press release issued via Internet Wire and picked up
          Bloomberg, Dow Jones and some other news organizations
          caused the data networking equipment maker's stock to fall
          more than 50 percent last Friday. Reuters did not carry the
          hoax. The release said that the company was under
          by the Securities and Exchange Commission, was about to
          restate its earnings and that its chief executive had quit.
          On Thursday, a 23-year-old college student was arrested and
          charged with the hoax and pocketing almost $250,000 from
          subsequent trading of Emulex stock.
          The ``plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of all
          investors who sold Emulex stock or call options or purchased
          put options on August 25, 2000 before the resumption of
          at 1:30 p.m. EST,'' Schatz & Nobel said in a statement.
          Schatz said other investors had contacted him and he expected
          that some of them would join in the suit.
          Hart had about 500 Emulex shares and sold them at about $80
          each in the middle of the share price plunge, which reversed
          soon as the hoax was revealed, said Andrew Schatz. The
          company's shares, which fell to $48-1/16 on August 25 before
          trading was suspended, have since recovered to close at
          on Friday.

QUEBEC Â Police sealed off the
                             heart of old Quebec City on
                             Thursday, creating a heavily
                             guarded security zone to keep
                             protesters and possible violence
                             away from a summit of 34 leaders,
                             including President Bush.                              Forklifts hoisted concrete blocks
              topped with wire mesh into busy intersections, and
              of police in bulletproof vests stood guard at spots along
              2.3-mile fence encircling meeting sites of the Summit of
              Americas.               More than 6,000 police officers will patrol the security
              Friday through Sunday to guard against incursion by the
              expected 10,000 or more protesters.               Quebec City residents and demonstrators from around the
              world watched as the final pieces were dropped into place.
              Police are letting through only residents with special
              and delegates, journalists and workers accredited for the
              meeting.               Protesters have dubbed the barrier the "Wall of Shame''
              liken to it to the Berlin Wall as a symbol of oppression
              division. Thousands of anti-globalization activists have
              to this picturesque 17th-century city, and organizers fear
              kind of violence that derailed trade talks in Seattle in
              December 1999.               But the first march of the week was peaceful. About 150
              people marched Thursday outside the Quebec provincial
              agriculture ministry and presented a list of concerns
              genetically modified food. A minister accepted the
              document.               The protesters represent a diverse range of activists Â
              organized labor, human rights organizations, environmental
              groups and other who say the talks on creating a
              zone should be in public instead of a locked-in conference
              center.               "The fence is a symbol of the destruction of our rights,''
              Clara Fogal, a director of the Defense of Canadian Liberty
              Committee, a human rights group.               Her group and others supported a lawsuit challenging the
              constitutionality of the wall. A judge agreed Wednesday
              the wall restricts personal rights, but said it was
              because of the security risks.               Police cite concerns of Seattle-like violence to defend
              fence, which surrounds several acres of landmarks like the
              Chateau Frontenac hotel that dominates the old city
              and the provincial Parliament building.               Seven men have been arrested on charges of planning
              violence at the summit, and police seized military smoke
              grenades and small explosives.               The closest protesters can get to the convention center
              where the summit is being held is 100 yards across a
              cemetery, on Rue Saint-Jean.               Along the streets, shop windows were covered with plywood
              or metal screens Thursday in anticipation of unrest.               "The whole situation is deplorable. I'm going to keep my
              inside the whole time. I may even leave town,'' said
              Hamel, owner of the Collection Lazuli gift shop.               To stay open on Friday and Saturday, she said, she would
              need to hire security guards, and the protests would
              scare away most customers anyway.               Local activists have made the wall a kind of bulletin
board for
              anti-free-trade and anti-U.S. sentiments. Among the
              spraypainted throughout the city are "Bush Go Home,''
              "Berlin'' in reference to the wall that divided East and
              Germany for decades, and "Viva Cuba'' in support of the
              hemispheric country barred from the summit for its lack of
              democratic elections.               Plastic flowers and colorful balloons are attached
elsewhere.               Protests also are planned far from Quebec City, with
              marches or blockades threatened in other Canadian and
              U.S. cities and in Tijuana, Mexico, near the border with
              California.               Cyberprotests also could occur. The Electrohippie
              says it is targeting Web sites connected with the summit
              protest activity Â most likely a flood of e-mail that
              hamper operation of the sites.

FBI's E-Mail Surveillance Getting Boost                                               Policy: Justice officials likely to call for continuing
                                            'Carnivore,' with privacy protections added.                                             By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer
                                                 WASHINGTON--Senior Justice Department officials are
                                            recommending that the FBI be allowed to continue using a
                                            controversial e-mail snooping tool against suspected
                                            criminals--with some new safeguards aimed at answering
                                            privacy concerns, law enforcement sources said Wednesday.                                                  Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft met privately with FBI Director
                                            Louis J. Freeh on Wednesday for a briefing on the "Carnivore"
                                            surveillance program, and he is expected to announce a
                                            decision within the next few weeks on a thorny issue that pits
                                            law enforcement demands against privacy interests.                                                  Ashcroft, regarded as a strong defender of privacy rights
                                            from his days in the Senate, inherited the controversy from
                                            former Atty. Gen. Janet Reno after it was disclosed last year
                                            that the FBI had begun using the electronic surveillance
                                            program to track the computer activities of suspects in a small
                                            number of criminal and national security investigations.                                                  The FBI program, dubbed "Carnivore" because it can
                                            quickly get to "the meat" of a database, is capable of searching
                                            millions of e-mails per second under federal wiretap authority.
                                            But privacy advocates, civil libertarians and congressional
                                            critics say that, because the program is installed directly into a
                                            service provider's network, authorities can abuse it by
                                            eavesdropping on the activities of all the system users.                                                  Reno brought in an outside group last year to do a technical
                                            review of the program and also created an in-house review
                                            committee made up of senior personnel from the Justice
                                            Department and the FBI to assess the findings.                                                  The Justice Department review team, in a report delivered
                                            to Ashcroft several weeks ago but not yet made public,
                                            concluded that Carnivore has several shortcomings but,
                                            overall, plays a vital role in helping investigators track the
                                            activities of criminal suspects, sources said.                                                  "It's quite clear that it's a critical tool, and the FBI has to
                                            stay on top of changing technology," said one official familiar
                                            with the report, who asked not to be identified. "All you have
                                            to do is tell the drug dealers that law enforcement won't be able
                                            to do electronic surveillance on e-mail, and they'll all drop
                                            their phones and e-mail will be the tool du jour."                                                  In delivering its report to Ashcroft, the task force
                                            unanimously affirmed all the recommendations of the outside
                                            review, which was completed by the Illinois Institute of
                                            Technology's Research Institute. Several bigger-name
                                            institutions turned down the job, complaining it would not be a
                                            truly independent review because of restrictions on how it
                                            could be conducted.                                                  Among the key proposals before Ashcroft, the official said,
                                            are: tightening the audit trail to determine which FBI personnel
                                            are using the surveillance program "so people don't get sloppy
                                            and slip into unauthorized use"; more clearly defining what
                                            e-mail material and computer data can legitimately be
                                            reviewed by investigators; and developing a more up-to-date
                                            legal framework to match the rapid advance of technological
                                            law enforcement tools.                                                  "This tightens up the safeguards and the ability to audit the
                                            system to really try to protect legitimate privacy concerns," the
                                            official said. "I would view it as a tweaking."                                                  The findings will likely disappoint privacy advocates, who
                                            have been anxiously awaiting the final Justice Department
                                            report on the issue.                                                  "I think it's unlikely that the attorney general would flatly
                                            repudiate or banish Carnivore from the tools available to the
                                            FBI," said Jim Dempsey, deputy director of the Center for
                                            Democracy and Technology, an advocacy group in Washington.
                                                 "On the other hand, I think some serious concerns have been
                                            raised about it," Dempsey said. "This represents a departure
                                            from normal wiretap procedure in that it's something inserted
                                            directly into the network of the service provider which the
                                            service provider doesn't control. The fundamental problem is
                                            that it's controlled by the government."                                                  Carnivore has become so notorious that the FBI is planning
                                            to change the name of the program, using a blander, numeric
                                            designation because the old flesh-eating moniker has taken on
                                            such a negative connotation.                                                  Justice Department officials said Ashcroft is expected to
                                            meet this week with privacy advocates regarding their
                                            concerns about Carnivore and other issues.

              The threats to George W Bush prompted a major
              alert
              A UK schoolboy sparked an international
              security alert after he sent an e-mail to the
              White House, threatening to kill United
              States President George W Bush.
              The 14-year-old pupil at Blake High School
              in Cannock, Staffordshire sent the threats
              from a school computer.
              He was investigated and interviewed by the
              Special Branch, after the e-mail was
              intercepted by the US Central Intelligence
              Agency.
              The teenager, whose name has not been
              disclosed, was not suspended, but was
              severely reprimanded by the police and
              school authorities.
              A spokesman for Staffordshire County
              Council said the e-mail was sent in
              November last year, at the time of the US
              elections.
              'Several involved'
              "Several boys were involved in this, but
              only one was reprimanded by police
              officers who went to his home," the
              spokesman said.
              The council was in the process of drawing
              up guidelines for schools on internet
              security measures, he said.
              "We hope to keep incidents like this to a
              minimum in the future," he added.
              The school's head teacher, Heather
              Bowman, described the incident as "a
              thoughtless prank".
              It proved that, in an electronic age, all
              communications were traceable and
              attributable, Mrs Bowman said in a
              statement.
              "The school is well aware of its
              responsibilities and has good monitoring
              and security systems in place, which are
              constantly being updated," she added.

              New Jersey Student Posts 'Hit List'
              on Internet               MIDDLESEX, N.J. (Reuters) - An eighth grader was
              suspended from a New Jersey middle school this week
              after posting a ``hit list'' of fellow students on an
              Web site, school officials said on Thursday.
              The list was found on Tuesday posted on a Web site called
              ''People2kill.'' It named several students of the Mauger
              School and showed their pictures, school superintendent
              Patricia Johnson said.
              Police in the central New Jersey town are investigating
              incident. Middlesex Police Capt. Gregory Sharkey said no
              charges have been filed but had no other comment.
              ``I'm horrified and very disturbed by this. It's a sign of
              times,'' Johnson told Reuters.
              The student, a girl, was immediately removed from school
              and is undergoing a psychiatric evaluation.
              School officials do not believe the girl was going to
              out the threats but searched her locker and personal
              belongings for weapons. None were found, Johnson said.
              The student has no prior disciplinary record. School
              officials said interviews with the girl indicated the
              may have been a prank, Johnson said.
              The incident is one of the latest in an epidemic of
              shootings and threats in the nation's schools and
              workplaces, reminiscent of the 1999 Columbine massacre
              in which 15 people died, including the two teenage
              gunmen.

With all the hoopla over the release of the final version of the Linux
2.4.0 kernel last week, Microsoft Corp.'s delivery of an interim beta
version of its Windows 2000 successor, code-named Whistler, got lost in
the shuffle.
 But according to Whistler testers, Microsoft issued build 2410 of its
next version of Windows on Thursday. New in this build are many
user-interface tweaks, as well as the incorporation of new anti-piracy
No more casual copying?
The most potentially controversial addition to Whistler 2410, however,
is anti-piracy code that Microsoft is calling "Microsoft Product
Activation for Windows," (WPA) according to testers. The technology is
similar to the Office Activation Wizard that's part of Office 2000.
WPA will tie a Windows product key to one specific PC in order to reduce
casual copying. In order to "activate" it, a customer will send data
about the installation, such as product ID number and hardware
identifier, to a Microsoft-run license clearinghouse. The clearinghouse
won't allow the use of the customer's product key on a PC different from
the one originally activated.
 Microsoft plans to deliver WPA in all 32-bit versions of Whistler
except those sold to volume-licensing customers and the so-called
"Royalty OEM initial install images" provided to PC makers, said sources
close to the company. Microsoft is expected to add similar anti-piracy
technology to Office 10 and Visual Studio .Net, sources said.

German police in Napster child porn probe
                 By: Linda Harrison in New York
                 Posted: 10/01/2001 at 21:14 GMT
                 German police have launched a probe into whether
                 Napster is being used to swap child porn on the Net.
                 The investigation will also delve into other online
                 file-swapping services such as Gnutella and MyNapster,
                 and hopes to determine whether users have stored
                 material on their computers.
                 "We are conducting inquiries in connection with that,"
                 Munich police representative told IDG.net today,
                 although no further details were revealed.
                 Napster, which lets surfers share music MP3 or WMA
                 files through its Web site, threatened to ban users
                 the service to trade pornographic images.
                 "Any exchange of image or film files would violate
                 Napster's terms of service," it said in a statement.
                 "Under Napster's terms of service, users are
                 for complying with all federal and state laws
                 to shared content. User accounts that violate those
                 will be blocked from the service as soon as Napster
                 learns of such violations."

                 taking part in one of the world's biggest Net porn

Feds link boy, 16, and plot to 'take

              Agents seize youth's computer equipment; family says it's
              all a misunderstanding
              Thursday, January 11, 2001
              By SCOTT SUNDE
              SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER REPORTER
              To the FBI, a Snohomish County teenager is a suspected
              cyberterrorist who planned to join others in unleashing a
              program that could "take down the Internet."
              Agents swooped in days before the program was to be
              tested, seizing computer equipment at the 16-year-old
              boy's home north of Lynnwood on Dec. 22.
              To the boy and his family, it's all a big
              The FBI is making far too much of a little computer
              noodling and adolescent boasting, they say.
              "They got it totally wrong," the boy complained
              yesterday.
              An FBI spokesman said yesterday the agency is working
              closely with prosecutors and can say little about the
              international case.
              The FBI has made no arrests so far in the United States,
              said Matt McLaughlin, a spokesman at the bureau's Los
              Angeles office.
              The investigation began in October, according to
              documents used to obtain a warrant to search the youth's
              Alderwood Manor home.
              DALNet, a San Diego company that provides Internet
              chat networks, contacted the FBI and complained that
              several computer users had begun attacks on it. The
              hackers caused computers to become disabled and denied
              other users access to DALNet, according to an affidavit
              by John Pi, a computer expert and FBI agent in Los
              Angeles.
              Investigators traced the user names of the alleged
              hackers, leading them to the 16-year-old and computer
              users in California, Michigan and Israel.
              In an interview yesterday, the boy said he used DALNet
              but didn't attack it.
              When an administrator there accused him of attacks, he
              said he "flooded her with messages. That's not illegal."
              A DALNet systems operator told the FBI last fall that a
              person using the user name "Booterror" had created a
              program that could "take down the Internet on New
              Year's Eve," Pi wrote in the affidavit.
              Booterror planned to send test versions of the program
              to other computer users by Dec. 25, with the intent of
              then spreading it world-wide, according to Pi.
              "That's totally invalid," the 16-year-old said yesterday.
              The teen acknowledged that his computer nickname is
              Booterror but said it is pronounced "Boot-Error."
              "Boot" is a common computer term used when a system
              comes online.
              The FBI agents raiding his home made it sound more
              sinister -- pronouncing it "Boo-Terror," he said.
              He said he tried to create a "Trojan," a program that can
              be sent out and used to control someone's computer. But
              he folded the project two months ago, he said.
              "I was just playing around and learning something. I was
              just going to make a small Trojan, and I just got caught
              up in this."
              He started working with computers and surfing the
              Internet two years ago, he said. He built his own
              computers.
              The youth had been attending a community college to
              earn the equivalent of a high school diploma. But he
              hasn't shown much interest in that or much of anything
              else since the FBI paid a call, the boyfriend of the boy's
              mother said.
              He said the boy is guilty only of getting a little
              over the Internet. "He's just 16 years old. That's all it
              -- bragging. He had no intention of doing all that crap."
              But federal authorities and DALNet are serious about
              the investigation.
              The company's Web page provided a link this week to
              news reports from Israel, where police arrested four
              17-year-old hackers suspected of planning an attack on
              U.S. computer systems on New Year's Eve.
              DALNet said in a prepared statement that it is
              cooperating with the FBI and law enforcement outside
              the U.S. and "will continue to pursue all individuals
              responsible for attacks upon our systems."

@_subject: Crypto sci fi: The Talking Kit 
Mary tried to ignore the sobbing of her sister in the next room.  It
had been two days since They came to her village and she was still in
shock.  Two days is the minimum time to wait, Alex had said, before
Talking.  Alex was the fellow from the Engineers Sans Frontiers who
had given her the Kit.  This was not first time she had to use it, but
it was over a year ago... she tried not to remember.
The ESF had come into her wartorn country, as they always did
whereever they saw the poverty that follows tyranny.  The Engineers,
Mary had heard, got their money from some anonymous group of
California Norte businessmen, from that place they called
Sallay-Vallay, but Mary knew little of such distant things.  They had
the geopolitical immunity of the Red Circle or Docteurs Sans Frontiers
agencies but were more like the Corps of Engineers.
The ESF had come to build (or rather, repair) the roads into the
villages.  This was permitted by the Rulers, it was after all free
help.  They could set up  generators but that was about all that the
Rulers wanted the peasants to have.  There were not enough trusted
police to monitor all the calls if every village had phones, after
Besides the bulldozers, chainsaws, and other machinery for turning
jungle into road, the ESF brought equiptment that let them stay in
touch with their headquarters.  They had some kind of telephones, that
didn't need wires.  But their communications were as controlled as the
peasants.  Armed soldiers loitered around the engineers' base and kept
an ear towards the phone station.  The ESF were guests of the Rulers,
dismissable at their whims.  Much like the Soldiers dismissed
peasants in night raids, only with less permenance.
During her regular chores, Mary snuck out to The Place where she had
buried It.  Under the jungle mould was an olive drab case that she
brushed off and lifted out onto the ground.  She unlatched it and took
out the metal box within.  Then she put the waterproof case back under
cover.  She moved away from that site, taking the metal box.
Sitting down, she took a key from around her neck and unlocked it.
Inside was a pocket-sized computer, a solar panel and some batteries,
and a small tin that originally held mints but now had electronics
inside and a pair of buttons and LEDs outside. There were some other
cables in there too.
Mary knew none of these words, indeed she could not read or write.
But Alex had explained to her how to use it, and made her demonstrate
what he had taught until she was confident.
Mary slid the little black stone on the side of the larger, silvery
slab with the shiny window.  It beeped, lit up, then pictures appeared
in the glowing window.  A little blue line at the bottom of the window
was  most of the width of the window, which was good: it
meant she wouldn't need to fill up the little yellow cylinders, which
took a day.  You had to put the cylinders into metal holders in the
back of the blue plate and then leave the plate in the sun for a day.
Blue side up.  And the cylinders had to be pointed the right way, though
there were little pictures near the holders to show you ---the
cylinders had a nipple on one end and were flat on the other.  The
ends had different markings, too, one like the cross worn by the
missionaries who occasionally visited, and one a single line.
It was also possible to make fuel by turning the handle of a little
gadget that Mary had seen, which was good because you didn't have to
wait for the sun, but she didn't have one of those.  One of her
neighbors had a radio that worked with such a handle; turning the
handle for a minute would play about half an hour's worth of music
from the one station that they could hear.  You could see inside this
radio, and there was a coiled spring in there, and it rapidly turned the
shaft of something that actually made the fuel for the cylinders.
Turning the handle coiled the spring, which then turned the
fuel-maker.  How spinning a shaft could make fuel was beyond Mary's
comprehension, but it worked.  The missionaries had been impressed by
Mary's ability to turn fur into fine thread with a spinning shaft, but
you could *see* that; making radio-fuel by spinning was invisible.
That radio had also been a gift from another fellow with the ESR.
The little window now showed a padlock, which told Mary that the box
had checked itself over and was healthy.  She also looked at the sides
of the box, and saw that the wax along its sides was unscratched.  It
wasn't wax exactly, it was wax that hardened into stone, "metal poxxi"
Alex had called it.  It made it very difficult to open the window-box
(except for where you put the cylinders into it), and nearly
impossible to open and put back together without it being evident.
But no one had found the buried case or opened the locked tin or
changed the insides of the window-box.  Alex had explained that she
was trusting the box to protect her secrets, and that if someone
tampered with it it might tell them.  Mary buried these gifts well when
she could not have them with her directly.
Mary studied the box in her hands.  The green thunderbolt of the ESF
was blinking in the window now.  She touched it, and recited a phrase
which she had spoken to the box when Alex had made the box "hers".
Alex had said to memorize that phrase, and tell no one.  And to speak
it only to the box, and only when you are alone with the box.  The
phrase itself made little sense, it was a rhyme her daughter had come
up with when she was younger.  The box, for its part, seemed to know
her voice, because she had to repeat here rhyme a few times when she
had that bad cold.  After a moment, the box chimed and flashed a
picture of Alex as a way of greeting her, then presented several
She touched the picture of someone talking.  This caused the scene in
the window to change, presenting her with two little colored squares.
One of them would make the box remember what she said; the other went
back to the first set of window pictures.  Mary touched the first
square and began talking.  When she talked louder, the square was
brighter, and when she spoke softer, it was dim.  Finally she stopped
talking, and after a few seconds the box knew she was done.
Now the box showed her arrows which she knew let her listen to her
message, and decide to send it, save it, or forget it.
She listened to a few seconds of it to make sure it worked. She didn't
think she sounded like the voice she heard, but Alex had said that you
hear yourself differently, and the voice from the box was saying, in
her language, what she had just said.  She wiped away a tear, for she
had described what They had done to her sister's village.
Mary put the computer in one pocket, then remembered that the she had
to check that some of the cylinders had fuel for the tin.  Again, the
cylinders had to point in the right direction, but there were pictures
showing how.  She put some into the holders on the bottom of the tin
and pressed a red protrustion, which caused a red light to
light.  When she stopped pressing, the light went off.  This meant
that the tin had fuel too.  She put the tin, with cylinders still in
their holders, into a pocket on the other side, and trudged off
further into the forest.
Now she had to find one of the wires.
Which had she used before?  The one by the East Hill she remembered,
so this time she would go right at the Big Rock and use the wire on
the West Hill.  Alex had explained that when you use a wire, everyone
can hear you, so its important to use different wires and different
times, so anyone who'se trying to find you has a harder time of it.
She rested after she found the tree with the wire.  She ate some hard
and cheese, and her mind drifted to the story Alex had told her.  The
window-box remembers what you said to it.  It makes what you said
"smaller" and hides it in a krypt ---the missionaries had mentioned
krypts, they apparently kept corpses in them, something that disgusted
her, but these were strangers, from far away, after all.  Maybe they
didn't have wood to burn to purify the bodies, so they *stored*
them... ick.  So the window box, picking up the train of thought,
takes my voice, shrinks it, hides it, then tells it to the tin...
Mary jerked, realizing that she might have forgotten to bring the
cables, but she had grabbed them without realizing it, they were in
the same pocket as the tin.  She didn't want to have to make the trip
out to the wire twice.
The tin uses the wire to shout my hidden voice, she mused.  How
ironic, They try to keep us silent, so we are forced to shout ---with
hidden voices.
And Alex, miles away, was able to hear the inaudible shout, unhide it,
and pass it on.  It was like the radio Mary's neighbor had, she
realized, only the radio shout was not hidden.  Alex had explained
that even if They were listening, they would not hear her voice on
their radios.
And while Mary could only talk to Alex, Alex explained that he could
talk (and write!) to people far away.  Many people; and all their
conversations could be private.  Mary didn't see how this was
possible, her Talker only worked with Alex in the field camp, but
that's all she needed and Alex said it made it easier to use if it
worked this way.
Mary pressed the red button again, and the light indicated the
batteries hadn't dislodged.  She found one cable and plugged one end
into the tin, attached the other to the wire which went up into the
tree.  Then she took another cable and connected the window box to the
tin.  The ends of the cables had different shapes and there was only
one way to fit them together.
Ok, now she was ready to shout.  She pressed a different, green button
on the tin, which caused a green light to glow.  This button stayed
pushed-in when she took her fingers away.
Then she went to the window-box, and found the picture of the letter.
She tapped this twice, and a picture of two gears turning was animated
on the screen.  There was also a short line displayed, which grew as
minutes passed.  This was like the fuel-line, the longer the line the
more voice had been shouted.  In fact, as Mary waited, she saw the
fuel-line shrink.
But the gears stopped and the picture changed back to the green
thunderbolt.  This meant that her voice had been sent.  She hoped Alex
would listen to it soon, because it was urgent.  She knew that Alex
didn't have to be listening, that his window-box would hold her voice
for him like it held it during the jungle-walk to the wire.
She pressed the green button again and the glow stopped.  She then
moved the stone on the window box and its window darkened.  Pulling
the cables loose, she slipped them into her pocket, hid the end of the
wire, and departed.
A lot had happened.  Their had been more fighting, and distant flashes
and booms, and talk that They had been replaced.  Mary had heard of no
more raids for some time, and people from the "new" goverment had
eventually visited and explained that Fear was over.  They even tried
to explain a list of "rights" or "freedoms" that Mary now had.  Mary
thought this was rather scary, perhaps a trap, but over the months
that followed she saw that one could speak, or travel, or meet freely
and that They did not roam at night any more.
There had been talk that the Gringos had helped the resistance, which
had been hopelessly weaker than the well armed Rulers had been.  There
was now talk that vehicles with the ESF's green thunderbolt had been
seen in the city, and so Mary found an excuse to travel there.
She stayed in a church there, which was accustomed to helping the
locals when they came to town, and had the priest there try to contact
through the ESF people in town.  During the last day she could stay
before returning, the priest explained that he had contacted Alex but
that he was unable to visit; but he had sent something for her.
The priest held a small black box in his hand, different from the ones
in her Talking kit, and led her to another room.  He turned on a large
box with a window that glowed, but showed no picture.  He slid the
black box into an opening in the large glowing box, and moving
pictures appeared in the big window.   There were rows of Outsiders,
dressed more like the missionaries than Alex's more jungle adapted
garb.  The priest explained.
"This is a movie of the Gringo Rulers, and they are deciding what to
do about the Tyrants they helped us evict.  Many of them distrusted
the Tyrants but had no evidence of his crimes ---did you know that all
telephones were listened to, back then?"
"Anyway, this is a real movie.  About four months ago.  The Gringos
are trying to deciding if the Atrocity stories have any truth.  This
was hard for them, because they are far away, you know, and They
controlled what the world thought about us.  But this is the meeting
where they decided to help us."
That is nice, Mary interrupted, somewhat hypnotized by the moving
pictures.  But what has this to do with me?
"Look there.  Do you recognize him?"  Alex was there, he was facing
the rows of people dressed like missionaries, and he was holding
something up.  Everyone was looking at him.  What an odd thing to send
me, Mary thought; I can't make out his face very well.
"Wait, dear, I have to turn the volume up." said the priest, twisting
a knob.  And Mary heard that voice.. the one that the window-box
repeats when she talked to it.. saying what Mary had said.. to the

We have found a literary agent in Zurich, who
indicated the willingness to assist in
                     the negotiations between our company and Richard.
After several rounds of
                     negotiations, some of which happened to be by

                     before the signing the actual contract, the agent
got the following very

            Justices Will Review Ban on
            Virtual Kiddie Porn
            By Laurie Asseo
            Associated Press Writer
            WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court agreed
            Monday to decide whether Congress can attack
            child pornography by banning computer-altered
            pictures that only appear to show minors involved in
            sexual activity.
            The court said it will hear the government's argument
            that by banning sexual images that do not actually
            portray children, a 1996 law "helps to stamp out the
            market for child pornography involving real children."
            A coalition of adult-oriented businesses that
            challenged the ban says it violates free-speech
            rights, and a San Francisco-based federal appeals
            court agreed.
            The Child Pornography Prevention Act expanded a
            long-standing ban on child pornography to prohibit
            any image that "appears to be" or "conveys the
            impression" of someone under 18 engaged in
            sexually explicit conduct.
            The law targeted computer technology that can be
            used to alter an innocent picture of a child into a
            depiction of a child engaged in sex.
            The Free Speech Coalition, a California-based trade
            association of adult-oriented businesses, challenged
            the law in federal court. The group said it opposes
            child pornography, but that films and photos
            produced by its members could wrongly be deemed
            to show minors engaged in sexual conduct.
            The group did not challenge a section of the law that
            banned the use of identifiable children in
            computer-altered sexual images.
            A federal judge upheld the law, but the 9th U.S.
            Circuit Court of Appeals decided in December 1999
            the provisions challenged by the coalition violated the
            Constitution's free-speech protection. The court said
            the government did not show a connection between
            computer-generated child pornography and the
            exploitation of actual children.
            Several other appeals courts have upheld the
            provisions, and in the appeal acted on Monday,
            Justice Department lawyers asked the nation's
            highest court to resolve the conflict.
            The government has a compelling interest in
            preventing the sexual abuse and exploitation of
            children, government lawyers said, adding that
            pedophiles often use pictures to seduce other
            children into sexual activity.
            Because it is hard to distinguish computer-generated
            pictures from those actually portraying children
            involved in sex, "The government may find it
            impossible in many cases to prove that a
            pornographic image is of a real child," Justice
            Department lawyers said.
            The Free Speech Coalition's lawyers said that even
            without the disputed provisions, the 1996 law
            "remains a comprehensive and effective tool for
            fighting the real evils of child pornography."
            The case is Reno v. Free Speech Coalition, 00-795.

            Man Accused of Spiking Trees
            for Radical Environmental
            Group
            The Associated Press
            BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) - An alleged member of a
            radical environmental group connected to a series of
            arsons and other crimes has been arrested for
            putting spikes in trees to destroy logging equipment.
            Frank B. Ambrose, 26, is accused of driving 10-inch
            spikes into trees last June in an area of the
            Morgan-Monroe State Forest slated for logging.
            Authorities believe Ambrose is affiliated with the
            Earth Liberation Front, a loosely knit group that
            claimed responsibility for spiking the trees.
            The ELF has claimed responsibility for 22 major
            crimes, including arson attacks and other acts of
            sabotage across the country. The FBI has attributed
            $37 million in damage since 1996 to the group.
            In a statement released Thursday, Ambrose denied
            spiking the trees. After his arrest, he refused to
            answer questions, including whether he's affiliated
            with the ELF.
            Ambrose told The Herald-Times of Bloomington he
            was targeted by authorities for publicly refusing to
            condemn destroying property to prevent harm to the
            environment.
            "Is it illegal to say that? It may not be popular with
            some people, but it doesn't mean I was involved in it,"
            he said.
            A six-month investigation by state conservation
            officers and the FBI traced the spiking nails to
            Ambrose through store surveillance tapes. According
            to an affidavit, Abrose's car was spotted outside the
            forest at the time of the incident, and police found
            hammering and metal-cutting tools and cotton gloves
            with a residue similar to that from the spikes in
            Ambrose's apartment.
            Ambrose is the Midwest coordinator for the
            American Lands Alliance, a mainstream
            environmental group headed by former Indiana
            congressman Jim Jontz.
            "American Lands doesn't support tree spiking," Jontz
            said from his Portland, Ore., office. "Of course, I
            hope that these allegations aren't true."
            Ambrose was released on $2,000 bond and is
            scheduled to appear in court Feb. 2. Tree spiking is
            a felony in Indiana punishable with up to three years
            in prison and a $10,000 fine.
            Leslie Pickering, a spokesman for the North
            American Earth Liberation Front, said he is not sure
            if Ambrose is a member of the ELF.
            Conservation officer Marlin Dodge said it is hard to
            prove involvement in the group.
            "There's no way you'll ever prove who an ELF is," he
            said. "However, we're prepared to show that he did a
            criminal act that ELF took responsibility for."

Mob Hacks Guatemalan Judge to
               Death                By Will Weissert
               Associated Press Writer
               Tuesday, March 13, 2001; 3:17 p.m. EST
               GUATEMALA CITY ÂÂ More than 1,000 people in a
               northern Guatemalan town attacked a judge after he
               issued an unpopular ruling in a rape case, hacking him to
               death with machetes before setting his body on fire.                The crowd was holding three police officers and the
               mayor of Senahu hostage on Tuesday. The town is 155
               miles northeast of the capital, Guatemala City.                Judge Hugo Martinez ruled late Monday that there was
               not enough evidence to hold two rape suspects who had
               been handed over to police after being captured by
               hundreds of town residents.                Shortly after the ruling, Martinez was attacked by the
               mob as he left the courthouse, said Faustino Sanchez, a
               spokesman for Guatemala's national police force.                The judge used a pistol to wound two attackers before
               he was overcome by the mob, which hacked him to
               death with machetes before dousing him with gasoline
               and burning his body, Sanchez said.                Other members of the crowd then stormed a nearby city
               building, "seizing the mayor and three police officers
               who were trying to protect the accused men," Sanchez
               said. The fate of the two men was unclear.                It was the first mob-justice killing so far this year in
               Guatemala, a country that has seen scores of vigilante
               killings annually in recent years.                Police negotiators and a contingent of Guatemalan
               soldiers were en route to Senahu, a highlands town in
               the largely Indian state of Alta Verapaz.                Locals in Senahu blocked entrances to the city and
               refused to let police officers, negotiators or reporters
               enter the area, said Edin Arondo, a spokesman for the
               volunteer fire department of the nearby city of Coban.                "The situation outside the area is extremely tense,"
               Arondo said in a phone interview. "We can only
               imagine what is going on inside."                Since the end of a 36-year-old civil war in which
               200,000 Guatemalans were killed, vigilante violence
               has become common here. Last year mass killings
               claimed 28 victims, and in the two previous years some
               100 Guatemalans died at the hands of angry mobs.

"Copyright holders aren't going to be happy with Freenet and
                    Gnutella," Mohr said. "They are going to want to
start monitoring
                    people at the ISP level, and that means there is
going to be a
                    coming war between individual privacy versus network
security."

@_subject: Digital Body Wire Systems  
Digital Body Wire Systems Conventional analogue body wire systems suffer from vulnerability to
monitoring. They are also susceptible to drop-outs if the
transmitter moves out of range and temporary loss of communication
results. On the receiver side, the usage of audio cassette
recorders to record conversations is inconvenient and prone to mistakes. The DFH-DAR-902 digital spread spectrum body wire system changes all
that by offering:     Unique TriMode(TM) modulation system (choice of three operating
modes - three devices in one!)
    Digital encryption for unbeatable security
    Frequency hopping spread spectrum for safety from detection
    Digital audio recording in both the transmitter and receiver
    Multiple receiver capability
    User programmability The Transmitter                            Contained in an elegant black aluminium case,
the transmitter measures 55 x 87 x 19 mm
                           (2.2 x 3.4 x 0.7 inches) and works on four
standard AAA batteries. The maximum power is
                           400 mW. The in-built digital audio recorder
has over sixty minutes of recording capacity.
                           The recorded audio remains preserved even
when batteries are removed. The transmitting
                           function can be disabled, making it possible
to deploy the device as a solid state recorder
                           only.                            The transmitter contains a sensitive
microphone with a connector for an external one.
                           There is also a serial data connector for
interfacing to the base receiver, for the purpose of
                           programming the transmitter and for
downloading the recorded audio. The transmitter can operate in one of three possible modes: "hi-fi"
analog, digitally encrypted, and frequency hopping spread
spectrum. The selection between these three modes can by done by
connecting the transmitter to the receiver via a
programming cable, and selecting the mode using the receiver keypad -
simple instructions are clearly shown on the in-built
LCD display of the receiver. In a similar way, the transmitter can be also programmed to one of three
possible power settings. This has a direct effect on the
transmission range and the battery life. The transmitter can be also connected to the parallel port of a PC via a
special high-speed interface adaptor. This makes it
possible do download the recorded audio directly to a PC in a standard
WAV format, and play it back immediately using standard
multi-media capabilities of a PC. The recorded audio can be also downloaded to the recording memory of the
receiver and played back from there.
