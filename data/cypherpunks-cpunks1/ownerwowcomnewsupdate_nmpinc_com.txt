Computer security engineers say they have discovered a weakness in GSM, the most widely used digital cellular phone technology in the world. Some are worried that the flaw could eventually be exploited to enable hackers to get free service by pretending to be legitimate
subscribers. A software developer and two graduate students say they can obtain important security information from GSM cellular phones. Click above link for the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association's reaction to this announcement.
FROST & SULLIVAN STUDY -- LOCAL VOICE SERVICES THROWN OPEN BY TELECOM ACT OF 1996
Designed to create a competitive environment, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was an invitation to companies from different market segments to vie for the same market share
in the public local wireline and wireless voice services market.  The
question now is, how well has it worked?   According to new strategic research from Frost & Sullivan U.S. Markets for Public Local Wireline and Wireless Voice Services, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 has created the most significant
business opportunity since the long distance market was opened for
true competition 13 years ago.  Many companies are entering the local wireline services market such as interexchange carriers (IXCs),
competitive access providers (CAPs), cable TV service providers (CATV) and utility companies, as well as wireless voice service providers such as cellular carriers, Personal Communications Service
(PCS) providers and wireless local loop voice service providers.

 WIRELESS INDUSTRY SETS NEW GROWTH RECORD:
 11,270,301 NET SUBSCRIBER GROWTH IN 1997  ==========================================================
  "America's love affair with the wireless phone is as passionate as
 ever," observed Thomas E. Wheeler, President and CEO of the Cellular
 Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) in releasing the
 Association's latest Semi-Annual Data Survey.  As of December 31,
 1997, there were 55,312,293 wireless phone subscribers in the United
 States.  (CTIA estimates that there are nearly 58 million subscribers as of today's date.) This is a net growth of 11,270,301 subscribers-a 12- month record. More people using wireless phones mean
that customer bills are down and company revenues are up.  Click link
above for the highlights!   ==========================================================
 TELEPHONE INDUSTRY GROUPS JOIN IN ASKING FCC TO RESOLVE WIRETAP ISSUES
  The major telecommunications associations in the United States have
 joined together to ask the Federal Communications Commission to
 resolve the dispute between the industry and the Federal Bureau of
 Investigation over new wiretap requirements. The industry groups are
 committed to assisting law enforcement agencies in carrying out all
 court-ordered wiretaps, but they argue that the FBI is requesting
 surveillance capabilities that go beyond the law.

 EMC CENTER TO HOLD SPECIAL WORKSHOP AT OKLAHOMA UNIVERSITY, MAY 20-

  The University of Oklahoma Center for the Study of  Wireless EMC has
 announced that it will conduct a special workshop on testing RF
 immunity of medical devices to be held at the Norman Campus on May
 20-21. Attendance is limited and registrations are on a first-come,
