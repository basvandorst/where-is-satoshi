Let me elaborate:
  Panels, meetings, testimony...where's the research? What is even being
studied here? This sounds like a "problem" fumbling around until it
reaches a critical consensus of definition. The opportunities for
shenanigans, for good or ill,  should be evident.  Personally, I was a horny little fucker as a kid. I won't say when
exactly, but the the lurid pulp covers at my eye level at the time tended
to focus on Ilsa the she-bitch of the SS S&M type themes. I DID find this
somewhat disturbing, if fascinating. It was not till sometime later that a
friend and I discovered his father's Playboy collection (my old man kept
his stash a lot better hidden)  and I was exposed to more gratifyingly wholesome images. I can't say that any of it did me any harm, though.  Anecdotal, to be sure, but it tallies with my observations of children in
recent years, whether watching cable, surfing, or whatever. I know there
are folks who won't abide it, but they will be better served by
Consumer Reports. And so I've said my say,

No shit. Glad it was rescued from the bulldozers and put to good use
again. This has to be the old satellite uplink site and tracking center in
Rosman. It was the major, if not the only, such site on the East Coast for
some time, if I recall. There were intelligence functions even
then, too. We were told the same thing about the dome; among other
things, it was to prevent prying eyes from discerning what the antenna was looking at. I'm at a loss, though, to figure the need for a level of secrecy
that would preclude acknowledgement that there was an antenna inside, when
everybody knew it anyway. Especially any spies. What, everybody just
forgot all of a sudden? I'm sure the NSA was a lot more restrictive
than NASA, but this is ridiculous. This sounds to me like journalistic
hyperbole, or maybe just a gool 'ol boy having fun at the expense of a reporter.     I took one of those school tours in '69 or '70. I remember them showing
us live network video feeds from Europe and such. No doubt the NSA added
some stuff, but contrary to the breathless implications in the article, at
least from what I remember, almost all that stuff was there back then. The tunnels, guardhouses, dishes, the dome, the redundant diesel generator sets, fuel bunkers, etc. I can't remember if the carpet was welded down back then,
but that was the level of detail this place was built too.  It was designed from the start to be self-sufficient and remain
operational in pretty much any emergency short of a direct nuclear
strike. At the time, it was a vulnerable linchpin in the global telecom infrastructure, and given the times, no expense was spared or contingency unplanned for. I highly recommend anyone go see it if they get the chance. I also welcome any corrections or additions to 30-year old schoolboy memories. jbdigriz

Ok, I'll correct myself then. It never was a commercial satellite
communications center, but the 85 ft. VHF dishes sure could pick up commercial traffic. It did do telemetry for a lot of vital birds, too. It was the 2nd of NASA's STDN (Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network) VHF
telemetry stations, opening in 1963. The first was outside Fairbanks,
Alaska. Mostly for unmanned LEO satellites like GEOS-3, but also used when needed on manned missions like Apollo-Soyuz. Data could be routed in real-time to other NASA telemetry stations like Wallops Flight Center for digitizing and
processing, or taped and mailed. So there were some serious phone lines running into the place even then. It was mainly used for NASA missions, then, and some DOD stuff. I'm
sure some other TLA's had some presence, as well. You can easily
see why the NSA would be interested in it, at any rate, given what we know
about Echelon now. And it was already built to the nines, isolated,
secluded, and crawling with security systems. Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute has a website at

"Tesla physics" is all the cruft that has developed around some of his more obscure (and late) writings, usually mixed together with stuff
Tesla could not have known about at the time of his death. To wit, the stuff about zero point energy and perpetual motion machines. And, sometimes, mixed together with the usual nutcase stuff about the Hollow Earth theory (zeta reticulans colonizing the hollow earth, Greys, underground UFO bases, secret Nazi weapons, etc.).
Thought that's what you meant. Wasn't aware that he had developed any actual new physics. I do know he was desparate for funds at the end and might have fallen prey to some embellishment and license. That he was arguably ill-treated might factor into it, too. Too bad his papers were spirited away and classified so we can't judge for ourselves, though. Look what government paranoia has engendered in this case.
and beyond SS, is NOT the same as saying there are conrmed "problems" with electromagnetic theory. There may be, and there are a handful of folks doing "foundational" work in E&M, but, so far, there are no indications that their foundational work is changing any engineering calculations. Quite the contrary, in my view. Electromagnetic theory basically "works"--to many decimal places of accuracy. Circuits work as expected, antennas work as expected, and there are no "unexplained observations" (as usually exist before a new theory arrives). There may be some _semantic_ issues, e.g., does a square wave or impulse "really" have components that were sent out _before_ the square wave or impulse? (A Fourier decomposition of a square wave starting at time t = 0 has "sine wave components" spread out over time and adding up in such a way as to give the square wave, or the impulse, or any other signal. Some think this means deep and mysterious things are happening, something having to do with time travel and reversing the aging process, blah blah Henning Harmuth may write fairly eloquently about the "dogma of the circle" and how  the Fourier decomposition of a signal into (allegedly) a near-infinite series of sine waves is "not real," but for all intents and purposes it all works. And the "new physics" people like Bearden go way beyond what Harmuth and Barrett are talking about: they bring in "curved space-time" and gravitation and antigravity and the ultra-weird notion that aging can be reversed by "pumping the conjugate time-axis of the Minkowski manifold" (OK, I made this up...don't have time to lift one of Bearden's direct quotes...and this will help train me in the jargon if I ever become a "new physicist.").
Nut cases like Bearden have the patter of physics down. Very few actual physicists waste their time dissecting and refuting Bearden for obvious Thanks for the references, which aren't familiar to me. I'll check them out.

One of the best ways to learn physics is to find out why perpetual motion doesn't work. Once [:-)] .

Some or most of them eventally went to his nephew and ended up in Tito's Yugoslavia. There is a Tesla Museum in Belgrade that houses them.
The missing papers were apparently copies of his partice beam work that were made for an Air Force weapon project. Whether the originals disappeared also is not clear from the PBS account.

CALEA is just one ratchet-tooth that needs to be stripped. This shit is routinely abused for purposes that have absolutely nothing to do with bona-fide law enforcement or court proceedings, and often in blatant violation of laws. No time for war stories, however.

Pretty short-sighted if CRII is a Chinese govt. intel operation. Looking through my logs I see scans from rooted boxes in Guangdong. As well as hundreds of locations all around the world. A number of Middle Eastern locations, for instance. Unless they're all honeypots, they're giving as much as they're getting. If this supposition is true, which I doubt. Could have been anybody, and no particular reason to single out China over any other potential culprit.  Nope, no telling who, and more importantly, no point worrying about it, since everybody and his brother that's wont is exploiting it. Just chalk it up to entropy and deal with it.
I'm wondering if that Mykotronx box couldn't have done more guod for U.S. intel if it *had* gone to China, but I'm not familiar enough with it to know. Unless the recipient was planning to set up a counterfeit assembly line or something. In which case I wouldn't be too happy if I were Mykotronx.
Since Mykotronx is getting press, I will put in a word for Bytex, which also makes encrypting ATM firewalls and such. You can get a way-cool Leo Marks WWII Silk Code mousepad from their website,  in exchange for your sekrit personal info.

Common carrier status for ISP's is not automatic, under the '96 Telecom Act and later additions. You have to file with the FCC and promise to remove material anybody complains about, etc. in exchange for indemnification from liablility.

In fact, IIRC, common-carrier status for ISPs as I describe above was actually implemented in the DMCA. Been a while since I looked at it; will have to check. It doesn't appear to have stopped anybody from getting sued for third parties infringing on copyrights, though.

Copyright office, not the FCC
DMCA is a piece of crap though. Probably illegal as hell, but IANAL. Anyway it's stupid to assume a liability that is not yours to begin with , for the dubious prospect of obtaining an alleged limitation on said liablity. I notice Napster has a Designated Agent registered with the Copyright Office. Lot of fucking good it did them.

What is this, Henry Kissinger's vanity website or something? It reads like one of his Nixon era State Dept. memos on Vietnam or some shit. Pure felgercarb.
No state worthy of the name, benevolent or oppressive, and in it's right mind, declares war with individuals, or abstract concepts, despite the dangerously deluded metaphors. Mr. Bin Laden must be flattered no end if he thinks that the U.S. reallly considers him personally, or even his entire organization, that much of a menace. Doubt he's that stupid, though.
That's not necessarily to say that military force is not going to be used, but even if a single judiciously placed CIA bullet could resolve the matter, and not just for the moment, it likely wouldn't have Bin Laden's name on it. Not for maximum effect, anyway. But, loose lips sink ships, etc. Plus, TV, newspapers, websites, etc.need circulation. Bin Laden is good copy. Hottest thing since O.J. Almost as hot as wallowing in the enormity of 5000+ dead, After a century which, as others on the list have pointed out, saw 100's of millions dead from war, famine, disease, state terror, etc. Ruwanda, Kosovo, Bosnia, etc, just in the last 5-6 years or so.
Not to discount the horror, but I got over the "It can't happen here" syndrome as a kid in November, 1963. Get a fucking grip, America. And get off your high horse, too. Especially if you want to do anything about it, even if it's just to preserve more than an illusion of Jesus, it's Sunday, isn't it? Off soapbox,

What I find interesting is how we can have a war without a Congressional     declaration, which out of practical if not legal necessity requires something at least approximating a foreign power as the enemy. It would be extremely helpful if there were some overt state action or at least a smoking gun to publicly identify such party.
Bin Laden and crew are not a foreign power, unless we are stupid enough to turn them into one, a  hostile one. Sheer folly when their precise complicity and the extent of their involvement in the attacks has yet to   be demostrated outside of their self-promotion and our desire to find the guilty parties. Who, I don't believe, give a shit about the Islam rampant bs. except as expedient, and as much as about selecting the toll collectors for the pipelines to be built through places like Afghanistan to China, the former Soviet Republics, etc.
I don't rule out a war. There are grounds for it. That'll be folly, too, though, if we pick the wrong enemy, or support the wrong side again. Not speaking of Bin Laden now. Or cut another deal with a devil who'll bite us in the ass again a few years down the road. If not sooner. If we have to have Americans dying in remote, already blown-up, mine-laden poppy fields etc. as postulated, kindly let's not do it out of crass political expediency. Again. Nothing wrong with revenge for 5000+ dead, either, but don't let's get more killed going after the wrong motherfuckers, or trying to buy the right ones off.
There, is that cryptic enough?

dict.org cites Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913):
War War, n. OE. & AS. werre; akin to OHG. werra scandal,
    quarrel, sedition, werran to confound, mix, D. warren, G.
    wirren, verwirren, to embroil, confound, disturb, and perhaps
    to E. worse; cf. OF. werre war, F. querre, of Teutonic
    origin. Cf. Guerrilla, Warrior.
    1. A contest between nations or states, carried on by force,
       whether for defence, for revenging insults and redressing
       wrongs, for the extension of commerce, for the acquisition
       of territory, for obtaining and establishing the
       superiority and dominion of one over the other, or for any
       other purpose; armed conflict of sovereign powers;
       declared and open hostilities.
             Men will ever distinguish war from mere bloodshed.
                                                   --F. W.
                                                   Robertson.
    Note: As war is the contest of nations or states, it always
          implies that such contest is authorized by the monarch
          or the sovereign power of the nation. A war begun by
          attacking another nation, is called an offensive war,
          and such attack is aggressive. War undertaken to repel
          invasion, or the attacks of an enemy, is called
          defensive.
This is not the definition used in the analysis, which references the much-bandied "war on terrorism". Granted that the English language is no longer what it was after nearly a century of concerted corruption through constant misuse  by all stripes of propagandists, disinformation artists, and damned liars, but any analysis that supplants shoddy analogies and metaphor for precise usage (and I'm wondering for what reason) is suspect. Also granted that this is what the politicians are touting, with only tangential suggestions of conflict with other states.
That's just for starters. It gets worse from there. Since that's the major premise of the article, though, I see no point in proceeding further.
Or like the way governments have got into the habit of placing individuals into roles formerly reserved for nations and states. They should be more careful about that. Sets a dangerous precedent, if you ask me.I don't think the idea is to acknowledge sovereign powers, either, incur an obligation to treat with, etc., but that's the inescapable conclusion. Better hope the sheep don't look up, huh?
Some people may hope he is.
