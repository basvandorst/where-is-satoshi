NOTICE:  THE FOLLOWING IS AN AUTOMATED RESPONSE.  YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE
ANOTHER RESPONSE UNLESS YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS OUTLINED BELOW.  I
APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE AND APPRECIATE YOUR COOPERATION.
Dear Friend:
Thank you for your e-mail message.  I appreciate hearing from you.
It is important that those who reside in the Fourth Congressional District
visit my web page at  to contact me.  This is
the only way to contact me via email.   Rest assured that I will respond to you as soon as I am able.   If you have
a concern that is extremely time sensitive, please call 1-800-944-9603. No matter where you live, I'm very interested in hearing your views.  In
particular, I want to hear from anyone who lives in the State of Oregon - as
Oregonians, we've got a lot in common.
However, due to the incredible volume of letters, phone calls, and e-mail
messages I receive, I am unable to reply thoughtfully and at length to those
who reside outside of the congressional district I was elected to represent:
Oregon's Fourth Congressional District.  If you are a resident of the this
district, I not only want to hear from you, I want to let you know what I'm
doing about your concerns.
It is important that those who reside in the Fourth Congressional District
visit my web page at  to contact me.  This is
the only way to contact me via email.   Again, thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts.
Peter DeFazio
Member of Congress
P.S.  If you are inquiring about tours for an upcoming visit to Washington,
D.C., please be sure you include your phone number in your e-mail message.
My staff will contact you directly.
