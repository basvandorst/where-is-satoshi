@_subject: Need your help. 
When I give the following command the following information is displayed.
# file /usr/bin/ABSgtar
executable or object module not stripped - Version 3.13-12.
My question is what is this version number ?
I am sure this is not the version of the file in SCCS/RCS.
Thanks and Regards,
V.Sreenivasa Prasad.
