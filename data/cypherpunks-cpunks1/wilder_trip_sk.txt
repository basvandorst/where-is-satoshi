@_subject: [liberationtech] Azerbaijan wants to register mobile phones 
Data retention law (at least in the EU):
This is also possible in Slovakia/EU if there is a "suspicion" (which can be
quite unclear what is the "suspicion") and consequently obtain court order...
I think it is illegal in the EU to provide _publicly_ end-to-end calls
encryption (without possibility of interception for legal/secret agencies).
At least in Slovakia, if you decide to find out "ultra secure mobile operator"
and provide end-to-end encrypted calls without possibility to intercept these
calls by legal authorities, you will not receive an official license for this
business. What practically means that this kind of business is illegal.
Of course you ca provide end-to-end encrypted calls for private companies,
organizations, etc., you can sell crypto phones and all other crypto devices,
but you cannot offer completely public end-to-end call encryption services
for all people...
I guess the situation is similar even in the US - I don't know if it is legal
to provide encrypted voice calls services _publicly_ (for all people) without possibility of interception of legal/secret agencies.
That's also true in the EU. If you are VoIP service provider, you also need
to follow the data retention law... I believe the situation in Azerbaijan is really bad, but probably not so worse
than in the other developed countries :-(
