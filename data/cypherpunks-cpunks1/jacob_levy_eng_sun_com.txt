Hi Yusuf
I don't recall the Jim's article mentioning "muslim" terrorists
specifically. Or are only "muslims" terrorist in your book? :-)

I respect your feelings on the matter and your ability to think clearly and
with great foresight also :-), but for this list it would probably be much
more useful if we got some _OFFICIAL_ answer from Microsoft instead of your
"I believe, I cannot think, can't see", etc. etc. You're obviously a
concerned individual but you equally obviously don't claim to speak for

Would you agree to: Nope, can't watch that XXX movie without first keying
in your ID?

@_subject: Q: Chaum style blind signatures? 
Could someone please explain what is a "Chaum style blind signature" and
how it can be used? I looked in all the FAQs on rtfm.mit.edu and could not
find anything about this.
Any help appreciated, --JYL
P.S. I've seen the term used in a document claiming these can be used for
     untraceable e-cash

No cause for alarm.
The way this works is that the cypherpunks list has members that are
subscribed through anon.penet.fi. If the mailing list sends the message as
you (as opposed to sending it as cypherpunks at toad.com) then it will send a
message from you to the anonymous subscriber. Because of the double-blind
feature of anon.penet.fi this will cause allocation of an ID. Hence if you
send email to this list you're likely to get an ID assigned and receive the
message from anon.penet.fi
