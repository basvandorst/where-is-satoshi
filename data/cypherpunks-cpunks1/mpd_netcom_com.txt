Perhaps one could adapt this approach to demonstrate to someone that you
know the factors of a certain PGP public key.  You blind the factors,
commit to the blinded values, and present the product to your opponent. He chooses to have you either factor the product or unblind the
modulus.  Do this a sufficient number of times and one can be pretty certain the key has been compromised.
Of course it would probably be simpler to simply decode a message encrypted with the public key as proof that you are in possession of the factors, but this idea struck me as kind of cute.

The product of a bunch of primes plus one is not necessarily prime.  It

looking for a large prime number in some range of integers, it is
computationally more efficient to simply strobe upwards from some starting

The behavior of the Branch Davidians towards their children is well
documented, both by child welfare workers in Texas and by sworn
testimony of former members.  "I've lived in Texas and therefore none of this is true..." is neither relevant, accurate, nor compelling.
The Branch Davidians were proclaimed "cleared" of charges of child abuse by Texas authorities in the presense of physical evidence which
would have been considered abuse in most other states.  Declaring that one has lived in Texas does not change any of this, nor
does it change the well-documented statistics on corporal punishment in
the Texas public school system, in which Texas is the nation's leader.

One mother reported that Koresh ordered her to spank her one year

child was bleeding.  This was because the child had cried while Koresh was giving a sermon.  I see no "restraint" or "compassion" here.

Events like Waco and the Persian Gulf War, in which an

Not at all.  We should remember Herbert's Two Laws here.
       1.  All governments lie.
       2.  If you think you have found a counterexample,
           please reread law number one.
Also worth remembering is the old saying that "a liar who lies
one hundred percent of the time is unlikely to be a successful
The trick, therefore, is learning to separate the lies from the
truth in a mixture of both.
The quintessential lie from the Persian Gulf War was of course
the memorable "baby incubator" story, recited tearfully on the
floor of the Congress by a supposedly uninvolved eyewitness who
later was revealed to be the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador.
The alleged events, which never happened, turned the tide in
Congress with regard to support for the war.
Of course lies abounded in the Waco case as well, with Koresh
being portrayed as a heavily armed lunatic yearning to fulfill
Biblical prophecy by perishing in battle with all his followers.
In reality, they simply wished to live their lives and be left
The pitfall here, which is to be avoided, is to start
characterizing every negative thing said about the folks in Waco
or Iraq as false, or to start suggesting that negative comments
are a ploy to absolve government of all responsibility for what
took place.  Some of the negative things said in both these cases
were certainly truthful.
For instance, political opponents of Saddam Hussein in Iraq
certainly had a markedly shortened life expectancy, and the
Branch Davidians certainly took a Biblical fire and brimstone
approach towards signs of independent thought or action in their
offspring.  Not a reason for lots of people to be killed, but not
a reason to recommend their canonization either.
The lesson to be learned here is that societies based on a
diffuse "Web of Trust" organization are far less dangerous than
those based on a powerful centralized authority.  A powerful
centralized authority inevitably devolves into interacting with
its subjects using the protocol...

The same thing happened in the United States a number of years
back.  Sex abuse "experts" began taking note of microscopic
abrasions and other signs of wear and tear on the genitals of
children who had been sexually abused.  They found that almost
all children who had been sexually abused showed such signs and
wrote lengthy papers on the subject.  They also appeared in court
with impressive diagrams and pointers and expounded at length
about the new "scientific evidence of abuse."
"So and so", they would proclaim, "showed a thickening of the
skin" or "a small scratch" which obviously proved something
sexual and inappropriate had taken place.  Lots of people went
straight to jail.
Then the scientists happened to examine a population of children
who had not been sexually abused and to their horror, they showed
the same statistical incidence of such findings as the "abused"
children did.  Mostly from normal self-exploration and play with
other kids their own age.  There was gigantic embarassment all
around and the scientists retreated.
Looks like England is going through the same learning curve.

Excellent questions!
I view society as a collection of services provided to
individuals. Things like education, housing, medical care, food,
legal services, locating appropriate employment, and others.  To
the extent that these services are provided in an efficient
manner at a reasonable price, citizens live well.
I also think these services should be provided by the private
sector and not by any centralized government.  In fact, I think
the centralized government should be as small as possible and
reduced primarily to ceremonial functions.
An egalitarian society can then be achieved by simply not making
certain groups of people, like the young, exceptions to the laws
which protect everyone else, and giving them equal access to the
courts and other social institutions.  Egalitarianism should
always be approached by providing "equality of opportunity" and
never by legislating "equality of result."
Taxation should be small, uniform, and applied to transactions
and never to the earnings of individuals.  Income tax is not
necessary to generate revenue and exists primarily to justify
government snooping into the private business of citizens and
secret police organizations like the IRS.  A VAT would do the
trick nicely and could be easily built into the DigiCash system
of the future.
I also favor a small guaranteed annual income which would allow
citizens to live just slightly better than they do in prison.
Incarceration can never be a deterent if it is a step upward in
ones standard of living, something the US seems to have lost
sight of.
As for strong cryptography, it should be unrestricted and used
whenever approprate.  If individuals wish to go to the trouble of
avoiding taxes setting up secret businesses that encrypt all
transactions, more power to them.  The small number of people who
will bother to do this will not have any real impact on taxation.
If taxes are reasonable and the money is used for things that
people support, people will be suitably incentivised not to avoid
Thus strong crypto, egalitarianism, less government, and
tolerable taxes can all live happily together in our future.

The theoretical possibility of untraceable cash systems and the
absence of legal sanctions against those who use them do not
imply that such systems will become the standard in the future.
Even in the obnoxious political climate which prevails in this
country today, strong crypto is in the hands of only a few
percent of the citizens.  In a society with a "user-friendly"
government, most people wouldn't even be interested.
If given a choice between ordering a pizza by clicking ones air
mouse while tuned to the Pizza Channel, and ordering one via
Tim's Strong Crypto Pizza Service in order to avoid a small VAT,
most people will choose the easy way.
A good analogy to this in our current society is the enforcement
of copyright laws.  Most people buy paperback books instead of
xeroxing them because they are reasonably priced and it isn't
worth the aggrevation.  If paperback books cost $100, this would
no longer be the case.  Most people buy computer software priced
under $100 instead of copying it from a friend because they get a
nice set of bound printed manuals.
Network shopping services which use strong crypto and
non-standard DigiCash protocols to avoid a painless VAT will have
poor propagation, limited access, negative PR, and few customers.
It's like trying to set up your machine on the Internet without
using TCP/IP.  Few people will take the trouble to talk to you
and you won't be able to talk to anyone else. Sure you could do
it, but why bother?

Neither of these things will be necessary to get the majority of

Again Tim and his friends are free to conduct all their
transactions via unbreakable protocols of their own construction,
avoid all taxes, and do business only with others who cooperate.
As long as the percentage of similarly minded individuals is
appropriately small, it has no real effect on society and
probably costs a lot less than an enforcement agency would.
Of course Tim won't be watching HBO or Showtime, shopping with a
major credit card, or helping his broker churn his account at
Smith-Barney.  Not my problem.
You are never going to get the majority of people in this country
to agree to design the default protocols for commerce on the Net
with the specific intent of making it possible for people to
avoid taxes using strong cryptography.  You'd have more luck
persuading them to tear up their health insurance or burn down
their houses.

I am not convinced such software exists, that most major
businesses would offer to interface with it, or that it would of
necessity be "simple" or "easy to use".  Once standards are
created for commerce over the Net and the collection of the VAT,
you are pretty much locked into using them if you wish to do
business with any vendor of significant size.
 > What makes you think the VAT will be small?
Bear in mind we are talking about a Utopian society of the future
with a downsized government.  Trying to support the current level
of wasteful government spending from a VAT would send people
fleeing for the borders.

I know of some places on the Internet where I can chat with
people using a version of Unix talk which encrypts.  But if I
want to talk to some random person, I am probably stuck with
using the default version which does not.  I have little hope of
convincing people to make the encrypted one a standard, in spite
of the fact that all they would have to do is spend a few minutes
to FTP it.
Encrypting everytime I use "talk" is therefore somewhat
inconvenient.  A complete escape from the above-ground economy in
a society heavily dependent on electronic transactions would be
even more so.  Again, you are free to try, but most people
probably won't bother.

The size of the underground economy is largely a function of the
repressive and outrageous monetary and tax system we have in this
country. When families can barely make ends meet with all the
adults working multiple full-time jobs, there is an enormous
incentive to shave costs.
In a society where taxes were managable, and put to a use all
citizens felt was worthy, such forces would be much less and
there would be enormous peer pressure on individual citizens to
do their fair share.  Kind of like the days when income tax was
two percent and functioned on the honor system.
Just decriminalizing drug use and the sex industry would get rid
of a very large chunk of the underground economy.

Since 2k is exactly what is needed for a precomputed table which
combines the S-boxes and the wirecrossing, I will assume this is
the approach you used.
Given this data structure, there are a number of cute tricks
which will get DES down to around 30 machine instructions per
each of the 16 rounds on a machine with enough registers and a
decent set of addressing modes.
The important trick is to reorder the S-boxes so that you do
lookups on the odd numbered ones and the even numbered ones
separately.  (1,3,5,7,2,4,6,8) works nicely.  This permits the
results to be ORed together in two groups of four with all the
necessary indexing held in a single 32 bit register, which can be
appropriately repositioned each time.  The precomputed key
schedule needs to be adjusted to reflect the new order.  Note
that with this ordering, the blocks of six bits used for lookup
are byte aligned if you consider the even and odd S-boxes
If you store the upper two bits of lookup table addressing in the
precomputed key schedule and shift both it and the right hand
block left two bits, all explicit table indexing vanishes and you
can accumulate the result of a lookup with a single indexed OR
I'm not sure what 30-something instructions per round translates
into for a 33 Mhz 486, but 40,600 encryptions per second doesn't
sound too outrageous using the above approach.

the effective age is really 12.
Pornography featuring performers under age 16 is also illegal, but
only production and trafficking is criminalized, private possession is not.  There have been a number of recent court cases which have
set liberal precedents for child porn laws in Holland, such as the right of research organizations like university libraries to be exempt

I haven't heard how the other servers are doing, I would expect
interest has trailed off there as well.
The problem with practical digital cash lies not in the
mathematics, but in the financial and legal arenas.  It is very
difficult to convince a real financial institution with deep
pockets to underwrite a potentially unlimited liability for
itself.  I suspect that for the forseeable future, digital cash
will take the smartcard route, and that money which can
anonymously traverse cyberspace in large denominations will not
be forthcoming.
It is also unlikely that faith of financial institutions in

Ordinary counterfeiting is analog.  Close inspection will always
reveal differences which can be used to distinguish fake money.
Counterfeit anonymous DigiCash, on the other hand, is
indistinguishable from the real thing.  If a bank is signing
blinded notes for customers and has underwritten to exchange for
cash any note bearing a verifiable signature, a cracked signature
algorithm is a very serious matter indeed.
The half-life of such an innovation could be practically forever,
as long as the discoverer does not get greedy and his siphoning
off of value remains hidden in the daily float.  By the time the
bank realizes that there seems to be much more ecash in

be long gone and the bank is likely to be kaput.

the last thing on my mind.

Uranium is not particularly radioactive, being a long lived alpha
emitter.  This is true of plutonium and some other fissionable
materials as well.  I can handle clad uranium or plutonium
reactor or bomb components in complete safety with no protective
clothing needed. The only hazard is from ingestion of the
material, or from accumulation of decay products such as radon in
a badly ventilated area.
Workers in nuclear fuel fabrication facilities have been known to
use small disks of plutonium sintered into a ceramic base as
poker chips.
Although U-238 can decay both by spontaneous fission and alpha
emission, its astronomically long half-life of many billions of
years results in a very low level of radioactivity for both these
modes of decay.  For all practical purposes, we may consider it a
stable isotope.

Uranium is used in munitions because of its mass, which allows it
to go through less massive materials like steel or concrete like
a hot knife through butter.  It is used both for bullets and
shell casings.  Especially anti-tank rounds and shells designed
to penetrate hardened military facilities.  The idea is that the
uranium penetrates the armor and the charge then explodes once
the round is inside.

Plutonium-239 emits alpha particles, which are helium nuclei, at
an energy of approximately 5 MeV.  Such particles are bulky and
can be stopped by a few centimeters of air, or a thin piece of
paper or metal foil.
In order to cause damage, alpha emitters like plutonium must come
in intimate contact with a material, such as the tissues of your
lungs or bones or the inside of your favorite memory chip.  A
billionth of a gram of plutonium inhaled or swallowed is
something to seriously worry about, but you can hold a lump of
the stuff in your hand as long as it is covered with a leakproof
cladding or vitrified into a ceramic.
It is in this sense that plutonium is extremely toxic and
hazardous to the environment, while at the same time not being
particularly radioactive.  Heavy shielding is not required
between you and it.
Of course once fissionable fuels are irradiated, they become
extremely radioactive due to a wide spectrum of short-lived
fission byproducts and then require precautions when they are
 > By "clad", do you mean coated in lead?
No - the desired properties of cladding are resistance to
corrosion and heat, as well as a low absorption cross section for
thermal neutrons.  We're talking about materials like zirconium
and iridium here, as well as specialized alloys of stainless

The danger stems not from the radiation effects of the alpha
exposure, which are not significant, but from the fact that
continuous long term internal exposure will eventually cause your
cells to undergo malignant transformation.  This may take several
decades, but it will kill you just as surely in the end.
With regard to this risk, internal contamination with even a
billionth of a gram of plutonium is something to worry about.
Some believe, for instance, that a good part of the risk of lung
cancer from smoking comes from inhaling alpha-emitting isotopes
of polonium and other elements that are concentrated by the
tobacco plant.  I don't know enough about this theory to agree or
disagree with it, but it has been around for a number of years.

It is not secure to use your private key on a machine that you do
not have physical control over.  It is probably secure to store a
passphrase-protected private key on such a machine, as long as
you do not feed it into a program which decrypts it.

Or monitors your keystrokes as you type in your passphrase, or

Given the state of Unix security, I would certainly not want to
type my passphrase into a Unix box unless I was the only user,
was directly connected to the box through a wire I could see, and
had just done a fresh boot after verifying the MD5 hash on all
the OS binaries.
Not likely to be the case at your average public installation.

Having a passphrase will protect against casual acquisition of
your private key, but only physical security when the key is used
will protect you against a determined opponent.
As long as I am typing, permit me to add my two cents to the
"digital signatures on the list" flame war.
Like many proponents of strong cryptography, I rarely use it in
everyday life.  I occasionally encrypt personal mail to friends
overseas when I know it is going to take numerous hops over
insecure links en route, and I will digitally sign mail or Usenet
articles if I want to say something that I consider important in
a way that cannot be altered or spoofed.  This happens rarely.
I would consider having to digitally sign everything I post to
the list, no matter how frivilous, the moral equivalent of being
allowed to speak only while under sworn oath.  Now oaths and
notaries are certainly useful things in appropriate places, like
courtrooms and lawyers offices, but I don't think any of us would
care to live our lives having our every utterance subject to
their certification.
It would certainly not aid our cause to have the government be
able to point and say - "Even the cypherpunks make people
digitally identify themselves when posting messages to their
list" - while at the same time attempting to explain to people
why we aren't happy with Chaum's less than anonymous ECash or Web
sites that require registration and personal information before
permitting access to privacy-related material.
The Net, like life, offers a certain plausable deniability in
what has been said, and who has said it.  Some of the best
messages on the list in past years have been Tim's witty and
entertaining spoofs of his ideological opponents.  Let's save
absolute certainty about the real or pseudo-anonymous identities
of speakers in this forum for times when, in the sole opinion of
the person posting, such certainty is deemed necessary.

I think you have your wires crossed here.  There was no claim
made that the models were underage in any of the erotica you

things such as incest, bestiality, foreign object insertion,
piercing, and other non-mainstream sexual themes.  Everyone was

the BBS which depicted children was legal nudist material scanned
from reputable sources.
Since the original complaint from the "outraged citizen" which

nudist GIFs, which were perfectly legal, one might argue that the
obscenity charges were just an indirect way to nail AA for daring
to have nude kid pix available on their BBS.  Certainly there are

100,001 primes were used for the rational factor base.  360,001

took three days on a DEC 3000.  The factorization was found on

@_subject: Digital Money 
I would like to take issue with the recently expressed opinion that
digital cash is not money, but merely a mechanism for communicating
What does it mean to mint money?  In the traditional sense, it means
to issue something only you can produce, and guarantee that it will be
accepted for some sort of goods and services.  In the case of paper
money, this takes the form of a printed document which is moderately
difficult to forge, and which can be exchanged for goods and services
of various kinds.  Since the issuing agency, usually a government, is
presumed to exercise prudent financial management to prevent the
currency's value from decreasing, and is likely to be around for a
long time, such cash can be hoarded with little risk.
In making the transition from paper cash to digital cash, only one
thing changes.  It is now the information which represents the money,
not the document itself.  Since such information can be easily
replicated, spent banknotes must be carefully documented and the
issuing institution must allow each banknote to be spent exactly once.
Cryptographic signatures and authenticity verification provide
excellent protection against forgery.
But these differences are minor ones.  Banknotes which have been
communicated to you through a secure channel, and whose contents have
not been disclosed to any third party, should be for all practical
purposes identical to cash.  Digital banknotes issued by a national
government should be just as good as physical banknotes printed by a
national government.
Most of the objections to using digital cash for other than immediate
transactions stems from issues related to trust in the issuing
institution.  One would certainly have less faith in a newly formed
digital bank operated through a string of anonymous remailers than one
would have in digital currency issued by Citibank or Chase Manhattan.
But given an issuing institution of unquestionable trust, there should
be no significant difference between digital cash and real cash, and
storing it for indefinite amounts of time on a floppy in your pocket
should be completely risk-free.

@_subject: Compiling Magic Money Under BC++ 3.1 IDE 
Earlier this morning I grabbed the latest version of Magic Money
from csn.org and compiled it under the Borland C++ 3.1 IDE. Since
the Borland C compiler is one of the more paranoid ones around, I
thought I would briefly list the things I had to do in order to
get zero warnings and zero errors.
The sources I started with were MGMNY10E.ZIP and PGPTL10C.ZIP.
After  MSDOS you will find that it is a good idea to
  in almost every module.  This prototypes
quite a few of the commonly used functions which would otherwise
cause the compiler to complain.  A few modules will require
, , and  since they call functions in
these modules which are not in  or .
The C library function "randomize" is defined in . This
conflicts with the Magic Money function of the same name which
initializes the MD5 based RNG used to generate coin ids. I
changed the name of the Magic Money one to "random_init".
There is no prototype for pgp_randombyte.  Since this function
returns "byte", not "int", this could be painful on any compiler
which treats these types of function returns differently.
Complete prototypes for (*output) and (*lookup) need to be
provided in the function header of pgp_check_sigs and also for a
different function pointer (*output) used in PGPKGEN.
The Borland compiler always warns on "if (a=b)" because it
assumes the user mistyped "if (a==b)".  To get rid of the
warning, you have to say "if (0!=(a=b)) which is optomized out by
the compiler.  This occurs in a number of places, including the
macro for multiplication mod 65537 in idea.c.
There is a reference to an undefined pgp_pubkey in fifo.c which
goes away if you  "pgptools.h".  You then also have to
toss in "mpilib.h" and "md5.h" to make "pgptools.h" happy.
It appears that mpilib.c has been persuaded to compile the UPTON
modmult instead of the SMITH modmult.  Unfortunately, there are a
few modules which fail to  the definition of UPTON and
still call stage_smith_modulus and smith_modmult.  Sticking in a
 to UPTON at the top of "mpilib.h" fixes this.
The conditional code which allows prior definition of external
versions of mp_setp, mp_addc, mp_subb, mp_smul, and mp_rotl
written in assembly language for some strange reason causes the
compiler to generate externals to _P_SETP, _P_ADDC, _P_SUBB,
_P_SMUL, and _P_ROTL instead of _mp_setp, _mp_addc, _mp_subb,
_mp_smul, and _mp_rotl in modules which reference these routines.
It does not seem to have this effect in mpilib.c where these
routines are defined.  Deleting the corresponding  cures
The compiler correctly points out that pgp_extract_rsa never uses
the variable "pk" passed to it.  At the cost of a few machine
cycles, you can silence the compiler by putting "pk=pk" as the
first executable statement in this function.
The function pgp_randombyte hashes a variable "time" without
first initializing its value.  It might be nice to change "time"
to "timestamp" and do a "time(&timestamp) unless it was the
authors intention to utilize uninitialized memory.  If the server
is executed more than one time within a second, it can generate
indentical random values.  This could be a problem when
batch-processing mail. Including a fast timer register in the MD5
hash in addition to the time of day in seconds would likely
eliminate this risk.
The program uses "safemalloc" and "mm_safeopen" to access memory
and files, but does a very large number of "fread" and "fwrite"
calls without checking to see if they completed successfully.  A
"safefread" and "safefwrite" might be a good idea so the server
does not continue happily on as the hash file fills up the disk.
I was thinking I might put the DOS executables for Magic Money in
my FTP directory, in case anyone wants to play with them but
doesn't wish to compile them from source.  Send me some mail if
you would like me to do this.

                    --------------------
If anyone wants to play, I have placed DOS executable binaries of
the Magic Money client and server programs compiled under Borland
C++ 3.1 using the large memory model and 8086 mode in
file for my server's key.  The name of the bank is "Magic Money
Test", the currency is "Tacky Tokens", and is minted in
denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 units.
I will batch all my mail with the subject "Bank" together at the
end of the day, download it, and run it through my server.  I
will send 100 complimentary Tacky Tokens to the first 10 people
who mail my server.
I will run stuff through the server for at least the next few
days by which time everyone will probably have set up their own
server and I will no longer be required. :)
I have played with the binaries a bit on my system and nothing
horrible has happened, but as is usual with foreign object code,
there is a small but finite possiblity that it could bomb your
system badly and eat your hard drive.  I would recommend that you
back up anything important before playing with this code and of
course no warranty is made, other than the usual one about taking
up space on the disk.

I have to agree with Phil here.  While the guts of PGP are
extremely useful for building other crypto applications, we
should avoid using the name PGP for anything other than the
products given that name by Phil and his assignees.
Otherwise, PGP's reputation will almost certainly be diluted by
association with large numbers of derivative applications, which
although useful, have not already proven themselves over time in
the same way that PGP has.
A good example of this is the popular disk encryption utility
which uses an MD5 passphrase hash and IDEA/CFB encryption similar
to PGP's conventional encryption mode.  As "Secure Drive", it is
a valuable addition to our privacy arsenal.  Calling it
"PGPDrive", on the other hand, would not have been a good idea.
We do not need a zillion other products with names like PGPPhone,
PGPTerm, PGPmail, and numerous hacked versions of PGP itself
floating around if we are to keep PGP synonymous in the public
mind with a single unambiguous gold standard for privacy and strong crypto.  What Tom has done may or may not be a good idea, but he should call
it something that doesn't have PGP in the name.

Given a pair of RSA keys (e,n) and (d,n), the owner may sign a
number x by computing x^d mod n using his private key.  In real
life, x usually consists of a message digest and a small amount
of constant information.  This prevents the product of two
signatures from also being a valid signature.  Anyone may verify
a signature by performing a similar operation using the public
key and recovering x.
Blind signatures allow you to obtain a signature from someone
without disclosing to them what they are signing.  You pick a
random number r and ask the signer to sign x*r^e mod n.  Since r
is arbitrary, this tells the signer nothing about the value of x.
When the signer gives you back r*x^d mod n, you simply multiply
by the multiplicative inverse of r mod n to obtain x^d mod n, the
signed message.  The signer still has no idea what he has signed
and cannot recognize it later if he sees it.
This allows untraceable digital cash, since the bank can sign new
notes for customers that it cannot later recognize.  It has other
interesting uses as well.

Young kids have the same feelings looking at realistic

that what they are viewing never really happened.  Many movies we

Many other countries simply rate movies by specifying how old
you have to be to see the movie.  These ratings are made by
experts who understand the effects various types of imagery are
likely to have on young viewers.  A typical blood and guts
adventure film might get a rating of 12.  Something really gross
would probably get a rating of 15.  Sometimes movies are
completely banned in certain countries, like "Predator II" in
Norway.  Note the absence of any mention of parents in the

his life, but a 16 year old can't even go near a movie which
doesn't star Bambi without dragging some generally unwilling
adult along.
No one gets protected from anything and the system exists
entirely as an parent ego-boosting exercise.

This notion that the state is not permitted to interfere in the

I'm not sure why suggesting that many parents would agree with

what it has to do with "winning" one way or another, or why you

I wouldn't really have a problem with children hearing the views
of Christian Fundamentalists, as long as participation wasn't
obligatory, and it wasn't a state-sponsored event.  If the
children were teens, I would feel quite uncomfortable with the
notion of parents having the power to deny them access to such

No personal attack intended.  I am a strong supporter of
egalitarian societies with strong social safety nets, and think
that youth emancipation will likely be the next big civil rights
movement in this country.  I am also willing to pay high taxes in
order to feel secure that all citizen-units are suitably housed,
well-fed, and taken care of.  This is entirely self-serving on my
part, since it cuts down on social unrest and street crime.

Au contraire.  I view strong crypto as a liberating influence on
everyone who is a member of the aforementioned families or
groups. strong crypto = absolute personal privacy.
I think the transition to an information-based economy will
result in a fundamental reorganization of who wields power in our
society.  In the future, all information will be available to
everyone and a 30 year old might have no advantage over a 12 year
old in his ability to create wealth.  This is certain to effect
major alterations to the power balance within families.
In times in the historical past, young people began closely
associating with adults at a young age and were able to function
as adults by the time they reached their early teens.  As society
became more complex, and a lengthy education was required to do
anything useful, childhood was extended and children were
disempowered in order to better serve the ever-growing and
all-powerful educational cabal.
This process has now peaked, and our society is filled with 35
year old college educated children who can't afford to move out
of their parents homes.  A reversal is iminent, aided by the
explosive growth of personal information technology, and public
education as we know it is heaving its last dying gasp.
All positive signs, IMHO.

Children are "cured" of their parents' ideas all the time. I've
known lots of kids who grew up in restrictive settings where
their access to forbidden ideas was tightly controlled.  After
four years at college away from parental influence, they were
magically transformed into happy free-thinking sensible people.

Teaching kids is sort of like feeding them.  In general, we let
the parents make the day to day decisions.  But we also let
experts research what things are toxic and hold parents
accountable if they insist upon feeding the kid lemon scented
furniture polish.  Both approaches are needed.

This is a trick question, right?  Caring counts for zip.  The
road to Hell is paved with good parental intentions.  Suppose the
fundamentalist father wants to beat his six year old son with a
belt everytime he touches himself to save him from Satan's
influence?  A little bureaucratic input from a child welfare
professional might not be a bad idea in such a case.

The constitution has no age limit on the basic rights it

been transformed into "adult rights", a term just as obnoxious to
many as "white rights" or "men's rights" were when those

These facts were well documented.  Child welfare workers visited the
compound and examined the children.  Signs of previous physical
punishment were noted as well as a room devoted to that purpose and
the appropriate paraphernalia.
A doctor at Baylor University Medical Center was asked later why this didn't cause the removal of the children, and said that while
such behavior would certainly be considered abuse in a medical
sense, it did not meet the legal definition of abuse according
to the laws of the State of Texas.
Texas, of course, is the leader on the national corporal punishment
bandwagon and dishes out over 250,000 state-sponsored beatings every

Just what the world needs.  Another reporter who spends a short
time on Usenet and emerges to proclaim to the clueless masses
that the Internet is bursting at the seams with child porn GIFs
and that the pedophiles are frolicking uncontrollably.
While it would be difficult to list all the inaccuracies and
misstatements of fact contained in Steven Bates' WSJ article in a
single message, the following leap out at even the most
inexperienced Internet user.
The newsgroup, alt.sex.pedophile.mike-labbe, originally formed to
discuss the legal problems of a BBS Sysop, is almost dead and
averages no more than a few posts a week.  While pictures are
occasionally posted, they are almost without exception art taken
from legal sources.  While some messages have been posted which
might seem to solicit illegal activity, such messages are
regularly flamed by other readers of the group, and illegal
activity is discouraged.  Calling this group "alt.sex.pedophile"
and characterizing it as the Internet's official distribution
point for illegal child porn is a gross misrepresentation of
The newsgroup, alt.sex.intergen, formed to discuss issues
surrounding intergenerational relationships, including those
between adults and minors, is represented as a place where
pedophiles congregate to plot their evil deeds.  But discussion
of the sexual rights of minors is only one issue covered under
the alt.sex.intergen charter and it would be ludicrous to suggest
that pedophiles are the only people to whom such issues are
important.  You don't have to be a member of a sexual minority to
find fault with American sex and censorship laws, and such issues
are discussed by people representing all ages, sexual
orientations, and professions.  Taking a few lurid-sounding
quotes out of context from many months of postings does little to
correctly convey the tone of this newsgroup.
Mr. Bates repeats the popular myth that Europe is some bastion of
readily available child porn easily accessed via the Internet.
This is simply not the case.  All the European and Scandinavian
countries now have laws against distributing such material with
severe penalities for violations.  With the large number of
American net.cops trolling the Internet looking for illegal
pornography and the cooperation of foreign law enforcement
agencies in shutting down sites, no such operation could stay in
business for long.
The comparison the article makes between "advocating pedophilia"
and Holocaust Revisionism should be equally offensive to Jews and
non-Jews alike.  Suggesting that teenagers should have the right
to choose their own sexual partners cannot be compared to denying
the deliberate killing of six million men, women, and children.
Dr. Fred Berlin, who should have known better, is quoted in the
article as suggesting that people in general, and pedophiles in
particular, are prone to do in real life everything they
contemplate in fantasy.  Since the world of fantasy is largely
devoid of the moral and social inhibitions which constrain our
real-world behavior, this is unlikely to be the case.  Since Dr.
Berlin is the world's foremost authority on the treatment of
paraphilias, we should give him the benefit of the doubt and
assume he was either quoted out of context, or like Ken Udut,
deliberately misled as to the purpose for which his comments were
being solicited.

Mr. Bates lukewarm acknowlegement that the First Ammendment
protects such discussions hardly mitigates his other inaccuracies
and in any case, is not at odds with my statement above.

No.  He was just attempting to convince the numerous readers of
the Wall Street Journal that Usenet has a "child porn newsgroup"
filled with the stuff and accessible to everyone on the net.
Once this incorrect notion is sold to the American public, new
laws will follow of their own accord, without need of any further
help from Mr. Bates.

Are you referring to those places in the world with an order of magnitude less violence, child abuse, rape, and poverty where young people have a reasonable degree of sexual autonomy and the prosecution of real sexual abuse is not encumbered by having to pay lip service to a massive right-wing religious crusade?
Perish the thought that these values might someday be exported into the United States, or that our own pedophiles might be permitted contact with them.  It's much more healthy to leave them all unhappy, embittered, suicidal and feeling "not ok".
I am reminded of an exchange a while back between someone in the Netherlands and someone in the states on the topic of attitudes towards pedophilia.  The Dutch gentleman asked the American whether he would rather his teenage son have a relationship with a "happy well-adjusted pedophile" or an "angry depressed pedophile".  The American, characteristically, replied that his preference would be "A Dead Pedophile".
Needless to say, this remark quickly killed any further discussion of the
topic. :)
My own opinion on the subject is that the social contract between America and certain of its sexual minorities could use some improvement.  Contact with places that do things differently is a positive force for change, not something to be feared.  Fred Berlin is no John Money.  (With apologies to Dan Quayle)
Personally, I wouldn't want to live in a country where anyone, regardless of their interests, was denied the opportunity to discuss them with others without a psychiatrist present to tell them what to think.  This is camel's nose under the tent talk.
My objections to the article are straightforward.  First, discussions of pedophilia are hardly some sort of case study to demonstrate the limits to which the First Ammendment can be stretched.  Far worse things are protected by the First Ammendment in our country.
Fully half the article is based on the mistaken notion that the newsgroup a.s.p.m-l is actively distributing illegal child porn to everyone over the Internet.  This is a group almost no one posts to, and aside from an occasional David Hamilton photograph and numerous clueless newbies on a quest for the fabled non-existant mother load of Internet porn, would not be used at all.
The article is extremely value-laden and in my opinion prejudiced.  It's always open season on pedophiles.  Had any more mainstream sexual minority been subject to this kind of bashing, or had its name used interchangably as the name of a crime, we would have seen the ACLU and Queer Nation ripping bricks out of the Wall Street Journal building on the evening news.

@_subject: The Crypto Home Shopping Network 
I noticed a little blurb on the Business Wireservices today
stating that a company named "Digital Delivery" has licensed
technology from RSADSI for a turnkey CD-ROM software catalog
called "CD Product Portfolio".
The product is supposed to permit a company's most valuable
software and intellectual property to be browsed, ordered,
unlocked, and installed from CD-ROM with "absolutely no worry
about hacking or unauthorized use."
The product is based on BSAFE and uses the RSA Public Key
Cryptosystem and the RC4 stream cipher.
Now the interesting part is that this product has been granted
commodity jurisdiction from the Department of Commerce and will
be be allowed to be EXPORTED outside the United States under
license, permitting foreign customers to create encrypted
software catalogs and make use of this distribution mechanism.
Through the magic of RSA encryption, a given program or image (!)
on the CD-ROM will only be released after the browser has
actually ordered and paid for the product.
Do you think this crypto is "strong"?  I am not familiar with
RC4, but it would seem unlikely that it is both hack-proof and
exportable at the same time.  Cost considerations probably
preclude encrypting CDs individually with different keys, so it
is difficult to see what prevents disk owners from communicating
keys to one another for the purpose of unlocking software.  This
idea of mass-produced CDs might nicely dovetail with DigiCash to
enable the complete electronic purchase of programs without the
necessity of having a high-bandwidth connection with the seller
to transfer the software to ones own machine.
Given the extensive "Threat of Crypto" propaganda we have been
hearing from government minions lately, it is very nice to see
the government pushing us towards a future where we may buy all
sorts of interesting things from foreign mass-produced encrypted
CD-ROMs with anonymous DigiCash, all in complete privacy.

Here is a simple problem.
Late one night, Bob discovers a clever new method of factoring
large products of distinct odd primes.  Bob may now perform such
factorizations in only a few hours for numbers up to 1024 bits on
his trusty old 486.
Bob spent a lot of time coding and testing his new algorithm, and
wishes to recover some of his expenses by factoring a few RSA
keys for well-to-do clients. Bob wants to do this without
disclosing his identity, so a certain evil three-letter agency
will not cover him with rubber hose marks trying to learn how his
algorithm works.
Alice is the CEO of a company who suspects PGP-encrypted mail is
being used by an employee to transfer trade secrets to a foreign
competitor.  Alice would pay any amount of money to read this
mail and confirm her suspicions.
Alice is a potential client for Bob.  Now for the hard part...
How does Bob make Alice, and other potential clients, aware of
the service he wishes to offer?
How do Bob and Alice conduct business anonymously while making
absolutely sure that neither is spoofing the other?  Alice needs
to know Bob isn't lying about being able to factor.  Bob needs to
know Alice has the means to pay him before he cracks a key.  Bob
and Alice need to exchange a factored key for money with no
chance that either will back out at the last moment and try to
steal from the other.
How much work should Bob expect to come his way if he charges $10
a bit for his factoring service?  $100 a bit?  $1000 a bit?

[Thud](Sound of Bruce Henderson fainting) This is an interesting
perspective.  I would find myself arguing almost the opposite. It
would seem to me that the price one charges for a product or
service should depend only on its value to ones clients.  Not
upon ones cost to produce it.
If the value of your product to your customers is $100,000, then
the price should be $100,000 regardless of whether it costs you
$1 or $10,000 to make.

I'm not sure about this either.  A short message about a hidden
bomb which reads "under your chair" is infinitely more valuable
than a lengthy message containing the last six months of postings
to rec.pets.cats.
Once Bob gives Alice the factors, all messages encrypted with
that RSA public key can be decrypted, so the number of messages
and the length of each aren't really an issue. Bob could keep the
factors and sell Alice the plaintext of individual messages, but
this requires a continuing business relationship which the
anonymous Bob may not want.
If the messages contain confidential information, Alice may not
want Bob to see them.  Since Alice is paying Bob big bucks to
factor the key, it is unlikely Alice would agree to let Bob keep
the factors to himself.

Bob is now doing at least twice as much work as before.  He is
factoring a random key and a real one for each customer he does
business with.  Since the existance of a breakthrough in
factorization is certainly of interest to people who do not want
keys factored, Bob will get lots of requests from the curious,
who have no interest in buying his services.  Should he prove to
someone in the academic community that he can indeed factor keys,
people would simply stop using RSA and Bob's economic future
would be bleak indeed.
Bob needs to charge a lot for his services, and not give free
demos.  The protocol needs to require that the customers commit
to the fee before Bob demonstrates his talent.  This will
discourage enquiries by the frivilous.

Gaaak!  All these people.  You are making Bob paranoid.  Bob is
definitely not going to put an ad in the paper.  His customers
are foreign and domestic law enforcement and intelligence
services and corporate security folks.  Bob wants to keep an
extremely low profile with the Great Unwashed.
Isn't there some way for Bob to conduct business using the
remailer at Hacktic and anonymous DigiCash(TM)?  Bob does not
wish to find himself at the bottom of a large body of water
wearing concrete galoshes.  Bob wishes to factor a few numbers,
transfer the money offshore, and retire without the general
public being aware that RSA has been compromised.

Victor S. Miller, [who I suspect is the same Victor S. Miller I
knew at UMass Boston many years ago], published a nifty little
paper in the mid 1980's on the computation of the function Pi(n)
which gives the Nth prime as a function of N.  He had a table
giving the (10^N)th prime for n={3,6,9,12,15,18,...} which was
quite impressive.  Calculating the correct value for the
zillionth prime directly is a cute bit of mathematics.

I'll also post this to the list since I need to correct a dumb
error in my previous post.
I previously stated that Pi(n) was the Nth prime.  It is of
course in reality the Prime Number Counting Function which is
equal to the number of primes <= n.  Computing the Nth prime is
trivial given a program which computes Pi(n) since Pi(n) is
asymptotic to a known smooth function and one need only evaluate
it a small number of times to refine an initial estimate of the
Nth prime into the correct value.

This is an approach that I haven't heard of before.  If one could

RSA-encrypt the same piece of plaintext by examining the
ciphertext, one could easily break RSA by a binary search of the
Given two moduli N1 and N2, and some plaintext P, and PGP's
favorite encryption exponent, 17, you need to determine if
N1 < N2 by examining P^17 MOD N1 and P^17 MOD N2.  Although this
is only a one-bit function, it clearly depends upon P in a very
complicated way.  Since P is unknown and deliberately made random
in practical RSA implementations, I am not sure such an attack
shows much promise.  I would guess that this would be at least as
complicated as solving an RSA or discrete log problem directly.

This is likely true.  However, it does not necessarily follow
that such an algorithm will be any faster than current methods of
factoring and might very well be a good deal slower.
What you seem to be overlooking is that the function Jim

examination of the results of using them, is probably an
exponential time algorithm itself as a function of keysize.
Performing such an algorithm log2(n) times does not yield an

As I read it, he simply asked (and quite nicely at that) if such
a algorithm might exist, and asked if there were any references
to it in the literature.  Now clearly he was hoping that such a
mechanism might offer the opportunity to binary search the key
space efficiently and perhaps those hopes were misplaced, but I

This is beginning already.  I haven't seen anything in the

ago that you can get the public up in arms about almost anything,
as long as you package it as either a public safety or child

illegal activities were seized.  They quickly moved to seizing
all of a suspects assets.  Now cops can stop you on the road,
empty your pockets, and take your money using only the
justification that possession of more than a certain amount is
evidence of wrongdoing.
Look at the engineering of public attitudes on marijuana,
underage erotica, and even smoking that have taken place over the

Pretty soon the public will accept the notion that they must give
up all their personal privacy in order to protect us from
terrorists, drug dealers, and people with rarified sexual
interests.  Only incompetent opposing points of view on this
issue are ever presented by the mainstream media.  Give these
people another year or two, and they will be telling us that mere
possession of PGP abuses children in some ficticious and
vicarious manner.
Because the government is so powerful, and we are not, we have to
avoid the pitfall of harping frivilous issues in a last desperate
attempt to thwart the federal agenda.  Attacks on Denning's
character, the Clipper algorithm, and the LEAF field, while
interesting, do nothing to help our cause.  What will we do when
the government presents us with an escrowed, publicly reviewed,
unbreakable strong encryption algorithm which is mandatory?  We
need to concentrate on the basic issues here and state them

Rather than have the holder and the person to whom the note is being sold

work "offline" without having to connect to the bank every time two people

Quite a bit of work has already been done on this concept.
Basically one generates a very large sequence of machine
instructions which computes the image of the output of an
algorithm under a strong cipher from the image of the input under
the cipher.  A controlled amount of redundant information is
added to both the input and output.  This yields a piece of code
so obtuse and complex that nothing may be gleaned about what
algorithm it is executing by observing it run.  Figuring out what
it actually is doing is a cryptanalytically hard problem.  Also,
determining a way of modifying the code which does not break it
is a similarly hard problem.
Once encased in such a module, an algorithm may be distributed
with no fear that it will be stolen.  This raises interesting
poblems with software patents, since one can not tell from such a
module whether it is performing a function in a way which
Of course, there is a severe performance penalty to be paid for
such protection.  But in the case of digital cash, it could
provide a mechanism for implementing a secure offline system
without special hardware.

Assuming the transactions are done via a tamperproof module
distributed by the issuer, and the math is arranged such that
using a note in multiple transactions reveals the perpetrator,
the system prevents anonymous double-spending while still
providing all the benefits of digital cash.  Of course, you could
claim that someone was in possession of your tamperproof module
and associated passwords, but it is your responsibility to guard
these and report them stolen promptly, just as with credit cards
and PINs.

If multiple transactions involving the same instrument reveal the double-spender, then appropriate action may be taken.  One could

I didn't mean to oversell the degree to which the scheme deters
multiple spending.  It doesn't prevent multiple spending.  It
merely breaks the anonymity of the perpetrator if two or more
people he has transacted the same note with break their own
anonymity and voluntarily cooperate with the bank.
There is nothing to prevent you from making N copies of your

In the real world, there would have to be some sort of limit on
the number of times such a spoofed transaction could propagate
before being cleared with the central bank, much like

cooperation would also be necessary.  Probably easy to get with

Through a commercial firm by the name of True Media, Inc, located

charge to ones phone bill by calling a 900 number.  An automated
voice system reads you the 7 digit number without the need for
human intervention.
Said tokens may then be enclosed in Email to the Sysop when
requesting subscription upgrades and will be accepted as if they
were real money.
Although this is primitive compared to the protocols we have been
discussing, it is kind of neat.  Using an automated response

Let's see.  I didn't read the thread in question but am reasonably familiar with the unsavory debating tactics of Mr. Tmp from other discussions.  As I understand it, Mr. Unicorn and Mr. Tmp, their true identities safely
concealed behind their respective handles, engaged in a minor flame war
and major ass-kicking contest related to the topics of crypto, privacy,
and nasty authoritarian governments.  Mr. Tmp, following his usual modus operandi, engaged in some reasonably clever hand-waving, out-of-context quoting, misdirection, and misrepresentation at the expense of a number of people, including Mr. Unicorn.
All this would have been water under the bridge were it not for the fact that Mr. Unicorn, who is wont to travel in circles considerably more conservative than most of his political writings, inadvertantly disclosed his identity in the thread while showing a friend how to use Usenet.  Certainly this blunder was no fault of Mr. Tmp.
Ultimately, as a consequence of this leak, certain business associates of
Mr. Unicorn, with no knowlege of Usenet or the context of the discussion,
were exposed to portions of it and the identity of Mr. Unicorn was
disclosed.  Again no fault of Mr. Tmp.
Said business associates, being relatively anal upper-class European types with a great respect for authority, were singularly unamused by
Mr. Unicorn's political views and the even worse things falsely attributed to him by Mr. Tmp in the heat of discussion.  Mr. Unicorn became worried that his business might suffer as a consequence.  Since I personally believe that one should not discriminate in doing business based on someones political beliefs, I would certainly characterize this as a moral failure on the part of Mr. Unicorn's business associates, and not the fault of Mr. Tmp.
Finally, Mr. Unicorn, mustering all the legal and financial resources at
his disposal, threatens to skewer Mr. Tmp for alleged libel, and Mr. Tmp,
lacking similar resources and unable to risk a courtroom defeat, is forced
to go on Usenet and publicly eat you-know-what with a large wooden spoon. Since Mr. Tmp is not well-liked in the Cypherpunk community, response to this sorted tale consists mostly of praise for Mr. Unicorn, and silence by those who might have been critical, but who don't want Mr. Unicorn to treat them the same way.
I don't think there are any heros in this story.  I think it is a dark day for freedom of expression in general and Usenet in particular.  In the past, I have engaged in lots of heated discussions on many hot-button topics, on Usenet and in many other forums, sometimes under my own name, and occasionally under a pseudonym.  I have been called many vile things along the way, and have had my views on occasion misrepresented far more cleverly than Mr. Tmp could imagine or articulate.
Nonetheless, if I found myself losing work because an unpopular view of
mine came to light, filing a lawsuit against another Usenet poster would
be just about the last thing I would think of doing.  Particularly if the
discussion took place under a pseudonym and I was the person who had broken my own anonymity.
Antics like this threaten the entire concept of Usenet as a reputation-based cooperative anarchy.  The solution to Mr. Tmp is to put him in your killfile, not sue him into submission.

No problems for released versions of PGP, which use only the 8086
instruction set and require neither a floating point coprocessor
nor emulation.
Most other crypto should be fine as well.  Crypto is pretty much
an integer exercise.
People have been known to use floating point to do multiprecision
integer arithmetic on Sparcs and large engineering mainframes
which lack a complete integer instruction set, but I've never
heard of anyone trying such things on an Intel processor.

@_subject: Fast Modular Factorial? 
A small question about large integer math...
We are all familar with the fact that x^(2^n) mod p may be
evaluated with only n modmults which accumulate geometrically
increasing powers of x.
Does a similar fast algorithm exist for computing (2^n)! mod p?
The only difference here is that one is accumulating a huge product
of consecutive integers instead of the same integer multiplied many
times.  I am interested in values of n around several hundred.
I have played with this quite a bit and am unable to see any easy
exploitable symmetry which would lead to an efficient algorithm.
Any ideas?

I should mention that I am interested in the case (2^n)! mod p
where p is a prime and (2^n) << p.  In this case no individual
term of the factorial will be equal to zero mod p, and since the
non-zero residues form a group under multiplication, the result
can never be zero either.
The ability to solve this special case may also imply the ability
to factor large numbers in polynomial time, but in some less
obvious way.

The GNFS situation is a little bit more complicated than that.
Today's factoring algorithms work by finding distinct square
roots of the same quadratic residue modulo the number to be
factored.  Each such discovery yields an approximately 50% chance
of factoring the number using Euclid's GCD algorithm.
Since searching directly for a congruence of squares would be
grossly inefficient, one sieves for relations involving arbitrary
powers of numbers from a set called the "factor base", and after
collecting an overdetermined number of such relations, finds
their null space modulo two in huge matrix operation.  This
yields a relation whose powers are all even, from which a
congruence of squares may be constructed in an obvious manner.
Most popular factoring methods including NFS, GNFS, and numerous
flavors of QS utilize this general scheme, and differ only in the
numbers to which they are applicable and in the methods that they
use to fish for relations in more densely populated mathematical
GNFS uses a particularly cute trick, which is to express the
number being factored as a polynomial with small coefficients,
evaluated at a small argument.  On can then construct a
homomorphism from a ring of algebraic integers into Z/nZ. This
permits sieving to be conducted in a particularly efficient
Finding such a polynomial, unfortunately, is a far from
straightforward task.  Current state of the art is to start with
a guess, and flog it to death on a workstation for several days,
attempting some sort of stepwise refinement.  Although the
problem is mathematically rich, no systematic method currently
exists to pick the "best" polynomial, and the problem of doing so
may be of a difficulty comparable to factoring.
The speed with which GNFS runs and the degree to which it
outperforms QS is extremely sensitive to the polynomial chosen,
so the blanket statement that GNFS outperforms QS by a factor of
10 on 512 bit numbers is in my opinion, a bit of an
GNFS is one of the most complicated computer algorithms to be
constructed, sieving and factoring simultaneously in both a ring
of algebraic integers and in Z/nZ. The algorithm has been known
to experience "cycle explosions" in which unexpectly large
amounts of raw data are produced from relatively small numbers.
It is certainly not something that can be regularly run in
"production mode" and it requires a skilled operator (currently
its creator) to help it coast smoothly through its various
I don't think GNFS is going to be available in shrink-wrapped
form for quite some time. :)

NFS and GNFS are essentially the same algorithm.  NFS is simply a
special case where a particularly simple polynomial is known,
Z[a] is a unique factorization domain, and some other nice
algebraic properties are present.  In the case of a general
integer, and a more complex polynomial, some things get messier.

I think this is unlikely.  The difference in speed is due to the
fact that NFS only factors specially chosen simple numbers, and
GNFS factors anything.  That is not something that is likely to
be optimized away.
Also, I think we make far to much of the magical ability of the
NSA to do things.  At the present point in time, most of the
cryptomathematical expertise in the world is external to the NSA.
The NSA didn't invent GNFS, or for that matter, public key

GNFS probably represents the final step in the evolution of the
"combination of congruences" factoring methods.  Further
refinements would probably be such complicated algorithms as to
be inpractical to program.
Additional improvements in our ability to break RSA will probably
come via some new factoring scheme that we are presently unaware
of, or via a method of computing the inverse of the encryption
permutation used by RSA which does not require explicit formation
of the factors of the modulus.

Such a situation does not apply solely to the NSA.  There are,
for instance, secret lodges of French mystics who devote
themselves to higher mathematics, absorb everything the open
community produces, and rarely publish anything or draw attention
to themselves.  They solve problems, write secret manuscripts,
put them on shelves, and have been doing this for centuries.
Perhaps the ultimate factoring algorithm already exists within
their walls.  We would never know if it did, unless they chose to
tell us.
The NSA is very good at solving problems that require "acres of
Crays".  They are crack numerical analysts and algorithm
designers. They also make nice block ciphers.  I do not think,
however, that they have deeply profound insights into the
complexity of computation that exceed those of the University
community, and certainly not by 15 years.

Rumour has it that the NSA nearly had a collective epileptic fit
when they realized the implications of Public Key Cryptography.
Yes, they did invent differential cryptanalysis and some other
techniques before outsiders thought of them, but I'm unsure this
implies some great cabal of hidden knowlege on their part.  It is
more likely a case of throwing research dollars at a problem
which had not yet captured the interest of researchers outside
the intelligence community.

I think the NSA has lost its edge completely in the last decade,
as cryptographic research in the open community has taken off. It
is much the same sort of situation experienced by IBM, when they
were slow to catch on to the paradigm shift created by
distributed computing and workstations, and companies like Sun
rose from nowhere to become major players.
If the NSA were a corporation, they would be apologizing to their
shareholders, restructuring, and trying to identify a market
niche they could continue to be a player in.  Since they are
funded by government, we don't see them doing this, but it is
absurd to suggest that they are still decades ahead of the rest
of the world in basic research and technology.

"Centuries" was perhaps an exaggeration.  I first became aware of
the existance of the French group when Martin Gardner published
an extremely interesting April Fool's edition of "Mathematical
Games" in Scientific American a number of years back.
The thesis of his piece was that some very simple expressions
involving transcendental numbers such as Pi and E had been proven
to be integers. When you checked them on a calculator, they did
indeed appear to be exact integers, in spite of a well-known
theorem which claimed otherwise.
The clever trick was that they were of course transcendental, but
differed from integers by a small epsilon far beyond the 15 digit
range of most ordinary calculators.
A number of us were trying to figure out how Martin Gardner had
constructed the expressions he had published, and quickly found
that doing so was a non-trivial mathematical problem.  We were
about to give up when a young associate professor walked in,
picked up a piece of chalk, and demonstrated a really clever
trick involving rings which permitted one to crank out such
expressions with the greatest of ease.
When we inquired as to the origin of the work he was citing, we
were told that this really clever mystical order in France had
recently decided to release this particular discovery into the
public domain, where it had served as the source for Martin
Gardner's baffling column.
Perhaps they will give us a factoring algorithm if we ask them
nicely. :)

Big service providers like Netcom don't interfere with customer

is impacted.  Even in such cases, they try to reach an
understanding with the user, and terminate accounts only as a

...or cancel those agreements out of spite when they don't get
everything done their way.
You know, I used to use BBS systems a great deal before large
providers like Netcom began offering personal accounts with
Internet access at reasonable rates.  A BBS is about as far from
a common carrier as one can get, and many Sysops disclaim all
your rights under the ECPA, read private mail, forbid the use of
PGP, decide what opinions may be expressed on various issues, and
boot off any user who questions anything they do.  Since the
Sysop owns the machine, they are legally within their rights to
act like this, and as long as there are enough users who will put
up with their behavior, they can run a system.
Now that Unix boxes are not much more expensive than PCs used to
be, every asshole in the world who played Sysop on a BBS now
envisions himself as Sysadmin of an ISP.  So you have an
infestation of tiny service providers, running on toy machines,
that coast along for a few years until the person running them
either goes bankrupt or gets bored.  I certainly wouldn't
subscribe to one of these services, because the management
mentality and problematical service most of them provide is
exactly what I came to Netcom to get away from.
Quite frankly, I don't see why Carol doesn't just get a Netcom
account and stop quibbling with this twit.  Stop letting him
waste any more of your time and let him play his administrative
power games with newbies who don't know any better.

Right.  And a small service provider can make any "terms of

the owner of a two line BBS.  With big service providers, such
things tend to be done in a somewhat more business-like fashion.

Well, if I posted a message to 10 newsgroups and some bozo posted
a message to a.c-e.n-a falsely implying that it was the beginning
of some sort of massive spam, I would certainly not be pleased.
If Netcom, after receiving some small amount of flamage on the
subject, summarily removed access to my account and made
themselves unavailable for several days when I tried to contact
them to discuss the matter, and then tossed me off with a
flippant "so sue me" when I protested, I would be even less
pleased.  Fortunately, I can't imagine Netcom even caring about a
10 newsgroup cross-post.
 > big is better i guess....
In the case of Internet Service Providers, big is definitely
better.  There are simply economies of scale which are not
realized with smaller operations.  Netcom has had some problems,
but almost all of them were growth related.  None of them were
intrinsic to the systems and network itself.

For legal purposes, most BBS systems declare that for the

their system.  The Sysop is then free to read anything he wishes
to.  This policy is clearly stated in the user agreements of
almost all BBS systems offering access to the public.

Netcom is the fastest growing and leading Internet Service
Provider.  Their ability to attract new customers is limited only
by the rate at which they are able to increase capacity.  Their
respect for freedom of expression is absolute and they do not
meddle in their customers' affairs.  Their prices are reasonable
and their user agreement is fair.  Works for me. :)

Perhaps an exaggerated description of Netcom a few months ago,

line when I dial in, response time is reasonable, disk is
abundant, and almost all software is available.  Speed of network
connections to other sites is quite acceptable.

The number of satisfied customers is not the measure of a site,

Netcom works with the reliability of the phone company.  It is
always there, almost always up, and is redundant enough that when
something breaks, it is still usable.  I pay my $19.50 a month

The problem here is that the news transport mechanism is not
particularly resistant to arbitrary text being posted by a user.
Newsreaders can check for forged "From:" or "Sender:" lines, but
newsreaders then call shell scripts like inews and injnews to
process their material.  Users can call these scripts directly
and bypass any checks by the newsreader.  None of this requires
any special privs, and only the lowest level of the news
transport mechanism, relaynews, requires set-user-id netnews to
The latest version of Tin does check for forged "From:" lines,
but the version Netcom runs allows anything to be posted.
Fudging the lower levels of the news transport mechanism to check
"From:" and "Sender:" lines can mess up other things, since
processes may need to inject news into the news stream which they
themselves did not author.
One solution to the problem is to have a secure level of the news
transport mechanism add an "Originator:" line to every message
which it handles. This will identify users attempting forgeries,
and will not require munging of an existing header line.

Although DH and RSA are believed to be of approximately equal
difficulty given the same number of bits, DH is additionally
vulnerable because system designers usually publish an "official"
modulus and primitive root for everyone to use, whereas in RSA,
everyone has their own key.
To mount an attack on PGP, for instance, you must factor a key
for each person whose privacy you wish to compromise.  Breaking
Sun's published 192 bit DH modulus instantly broke SunRPC on all
machines using the protocol.  The latter was a lot less work than the former.

It strikes me that this would be the perfect way to generate

entire AA collection, hooked up to the net through a T-3, and
available for a nominal fee per GIF, could easily make the AA

It's two things.  It's a "killer app" for strong crypto, and at
the same time, a crypto public relations disaster.
Let me now make the argument that the advantages of the first far
outweigh the disadvantages of the second.
Success in spreading cryptography will not be achieved by
convincing the government that we are all nice people with noble
motives and asking their permission.  It will be achieved by
writing neat code like PGP which protects privacy and individual
freedom regardless of the plans of the state.
The public has already been indoctrinated by the government that
cryptography permits Terrorists, Pedophiles, and Drug Dealers to
thumb their noses at law enforcement, and has been fed a
comprehensive series of alarmist scenarios about what this might
imply.  Terms like "message laundering" are beginning to be used
in the media to describe fundamental Cypherpunk technology, and
the level of public anxiety about such issues is being
deliberately raised.
Robert Anton Wilson once commented that freedom and democracy
make infrequent appearances in the totality of human history
because "All you have to do is frighten the people, and they will
beg you to take their freedoms away." We probably only have a
short time remaining in which to implement a privacy-friendly
world Net before the Powers That Be(tm) engineer consent for the
implementation of something much more Draconian.
Given the current political climate, there is therefore little
incremental heat likely to be born from the revelation that
strong crypto permits people to purchase AA GIFs, and
considerable likely benefit from being able to implement and test
strong crypto based digital cash technology in conjunction with a
virtually unlimited highly motivated customer base.
There is also the added advantage of generating revenue to assist
the AA BBS Sysops with their legal problems, before the
precedents created become OUR legal problems.

Some Islamic country (I forget which one) quashed opposition by

Fear, Greed, and Gonads are the major human motivators which must
be tapped for symmmetry-breaking change in social organization to
occur. AA GIFs are directly targeted at the third of these.  Girl
Scout Cookies have no significant cross-section with any of these
motivators, are already available everywhere, and are much more

This might very well be true for a restricted set of images, but
I seriously doubt that arbitrary color photographic images take
three times less space with this system than with JPEG given
comparable retention of detail.
Also, are we suggesting that images transmit exactly three times
faster as both GIF and JPEG.  This is somewhat odd, given that
the difference in size between the two latter formats is often a
factor of ten? If you can beat JPEG by a factor of three, you can
beat GIF by about a factor of 30.
If you really can do this, you should be working on MPEG-4, and
not spamming our nice little list with advertising material.  I
should point out that neither Fractals, Lapped transforms, or

I read the entire lengthy contract and found quite a few things
which appear to be designed to cover the bank's posterior.
1.  Both parties stipulate that their relationship is a     business relationship and not a fiduciary relationship.
2.  Your account is not FDIC insured. 3.  The bank accepts no liability for anything going wrong,     although it may, at its sole option, attempt to make
    ammends.
4.  Parties agree to wave a jury trial.
5.  Parties agree to binding arbitration. 6.  General waffling to the effect that the tiny fees collected
    imply an equally tiny responsiblity and potential liability
    on the part of the bank.  Now most of this language also appears in the fine print of the
First Virtual agreement, so it is not like you have an option
of trading on the Internet under the rules which govern your
ordinary checking account. One wonders whether signing away all responsibilty on the part of
the bank is going to be the standard for using digital money
on the Internet, or whether consumers will demand protection
when using these new services.  One has to be careful that when new technology replaces old, the privacy protection which applied to the old also applies to the
new.  Good examples of this in the past are the ways in which the rights you have to the privacy of paper mail generally fail to be extended to Email, and of course "regulation E", which exempted
bank accounts which were capable of Electronic Funds Transfer from
a great deal of the protection which used to govern users of
ordinary checking accounts. On the brighter side, Dr. Chaum's success in convincing someone
to back DigiCash with actual US dollars certainly makes advances
in breaking public key cryptography worth a great more than the
tiny prizes currently offered by RSADSI. It will be interesting to see how this all works out in the
next few months.  Arjen Lenstra is planning on factoring RSA-130
on the Web for a high performance computing conference later this
year.  This should lead to some very robust estimates for the
amount of computing power needed for GNFS to break 512 bit PGP

True, but removing packaging materials and protective layers is a
long way from imaging the charges tunneled to and from the
floating gates of EEPROM cells, which is the particular
application we are discussing.
Also bear in mind that in a real device, the tamper-resistant
packaging will be considerably more intractable than conventional
semiconductor packaging, and these devices are often designed to
automatically erase all data if signs of tampering are detected.

Yes.  This is truely impressive technology which continues to
improve with leaps and bounds.  SEM/TEM/STEM voltage-contrast

devices, and AFM instruments can do voltage measurements on
running devices down to nanometer and picosecond resolutions.

While I don't necessarily disagree with Perry that sufficiently
advanced technology can reverse-engineer almost anything (the
kind of advanced technology that is indistinguishable from

doing such things today which are either insurmountable or at the
very least a strong indication that there are better ways to
approach the problem.

That is correct.  A very thin layer of dielectric material is
placed on top of a MOS gate.  This "floating gate" can be charged
by applying enough voltage for electrons to tunnel through the
dielectric and charge the gate, which switches the transistor. In
the EPROM, the stored electrons can be given enough energy from
exposure to ultraviolet light to tunnel back out which erases the
Unfortunately, as the geometry shrinks, a longer and longer
exposure to the light is required for erasure, which becomes
annoyingly long for sub-micron technologies.

Almost.  The EEPROM is an advance over the EPROM which permits
the device to be erased electrically.  Fowler-Nordheim Tunneling
is an effect whereby low energy electrons can sneak through the
dielectric in the presence of a very high electric field.  In the
EEPROM, this is used to discharge the floating gates in place of
the UV exposure.  Programming is still done by applying a voltage
high enough to tunnel through the dielectric as in the EPROM.

I've never done any calculations, but the charge stays around
"long enough."
The major drawback is that the dielectric is very thin, and
degrades after after hundreds of thousands or millions of write
cycles to the point where the floating gate can no longer retain
a charge.  Therefore such devices are limited in the number of
write cycles they can undergo before wearing out.

It's more of a case of the trapped electrons absorbing a high
energy photon and getting enough energy to tunnel through the
dielectric, but you have the general idea.  EEPROM erasure is as
described above.

The charge is minute, the dielectric is thin, and damage to the
dielectric would leak the charge.  I'm not sure what a secondary
electron spectrum from a beam that penetrated the dielectric
would disclose about the charge on the gate, but I would tend to
think the dielectric would interfere with tunneling or atomic
force instruments trying to take such measurements.  Again, this
is Tim's area of expertise, and he can probably give you the gory
details on why the state of such devices is difficult to image.

While I doubt that many people inadvertantly stumble across the

nature of Usenet can certainly create such problems, particularly
for those in the habit of grabbing all new messages in their

illegal material merely by virtue of its momentary presence in
their cache, screen buffer, or usenet spool.
There is a case now involving the University of Pittsburgh in
which the Feds are attempting to prove that an individual was in
possession of certain child porn images on his own PC during a
brief span of time in 1993.
There was also a case in which a BBS operator was charged based
on an allegedly illegal image found in a directory containing
unchecked user uploads.  Had the cops done nothing, the image
would have been wiped shortly thereafter.

If you are doing a distributed search of a key space, then it is
of course possible that people, either accidently or
deliberately, may fail to correctly do their part of the search
and report misleading results.  You may recall a hostile attack
on SSL a while back where the design was flawless but the desired
key failed to appear when the results of the individual searches
were merged.
Fortunately, where integer factorization is concerned, it is
trivial to verify the full and partial relations for correctness
and discard any bad data during the counting process.  Thus there
is no chance of garbage making it into the final reduction.

The input to the reduction step is simply a large number of ways
of making the number "1" by multiplying together elements of the
factor base, all modulo the number of be factored.  Given an
overdetermined set of such relations, one can can search for
linearly dependent combinations of their exponents modulo 2. Each
such dependency permits one to construct a relation in which all
the exponents are even, and possibly a non-trivial square root of
1 modulo N.  Since each dependency has at least a 50-50 chance of
yielding a factor of N, only a handful of them are needed.
Certainly bad data in the matrix could cause problems, but the
matrix is sparse and damage would probably be localized.  You
might get out some dependencies that weren't real, but unless you
had quite a lot of garbage data, you would probably get enough
good ones to succeed.  Non-relations involving small primes would
probably be more poisonous than ones involving the high end of
the factor base.  In any case, as I stated earlier, it is trivial
to guarantee all the data going into the final reduction has been

The only safeguards I can think of when doing a distributed
search of a keyspace are to randomly assign each area to be
searched to multiple participants, and to encapsulate the
software in some sort of hack-resistant module, possibly
calculating a running hash which could be checked when results
were submitted to the central authority.
If you have 10,000 volunteers, each searching 0.01% of the
keyspace using a klutz-proof software module, quite a few
sophisticated users would have to collaborate to create a
significant chance of missing the key.
In cyptography, as in life, there are no guarantees.

I completely agree with this.  Java incorporates the type of
automatic corruption-proof memory management found in languages
like APL, the basic notions of object oriented programming, fast
dynamic linking, and a C-like program structure.
This is powerful combination of features and gives Java the
potential to do all the platform-independent things that were
advertised for C before the rude reality of thousand line
makefiles reared its ugly head. . The complete specification of
the Java Virtual Machine means that the behavior of Java programs
is perfectly well-defined, and one does not have to tweek
anything which is processor or operating system dependent.
In the future, I expect Java bytecode to become a significant
channel for the distribution of popular applications, with
compilation to fast native code on numerous platforms.
Java is clean, and its concepts are easily understandable even by
persons whose eyes glaze over after the first 30 pages of the C++

Expect NT to be a Unix-killer in the future.  It can be ported to
any machine, and its microkernel client-server design with
pluggable third-party APIs permits it to manifest simultaneously
the personalities of numerous different operating systems.
Contrast this with the many different binary incompatible Unix
flavors and its marketing advantage becomes clear.  NT sales just
broke one billion per year and are climbing steadily.
NT and Java will be the big players in the future.  If Netscape
becomes its own OS, requiring no Microsoft software, it will
probably capture the low-end "Web TV" market.

Indeed.  One can imagine a nice set of Java classes and methods
which interoperates with PGP, and has none of the fixed buffer
allocation, limits, and awkward memory management present in PGP.
Java tends to do the kinds of things PGP does very cleanly, and
implementors can worry about the algorithms without being
distracted by housekeeping.  Any code produced can instantly be
used by others in their applications.  This is a powerful
paradigm, encourages others to expand on existing work, and
renders kludges like "PGPTools" unnecessary.

Java Applets, mobile crypto agents, and the new Web-centric view
of cyberspace will go a long way towards encouraging the
planet-wide use of strong crypto, as well as effectively swatting
annoying mosquitos like ITAR.
Indeed, with Java, I can put up a Web page which teaches someone
about a cryptographic algorithm, allows him to try it out and run
sample data through it, and provides him with a
platform-independent implementation of it to use as he wishes.
All in one fell swoop.  That's a pretty powerful concept.
Java has come at the right time, and it will produce chaotic
change in the existing order.
Should be interesting.

This is overly pessimistic.  Java primitive data types are fully
specified and Java operators are well-defined in the sense that
their results are unambiguous with specified input.  One
certainly does not have situations as one has in C, where things
like "int" or what happens to the sign bit on certain shifts is
left up to the implementor's discretion.  Even the typical "side
effects" tricks with passed parameters should be impossible with
Java programs.
While it is true that formal meta-language descriptions of Java
semantics and the universe of Java types are not currently
provided for the language, and the traditional kinds of formal
correctness proofs haven't been published, the language is
sufficiently simple and restricted to make it unlikely that major
loopholes will be discovered in this area.  I would be truly
surprised, for instance, if instruction sequences which
unbalanced the stack, wrote out of bounds, or accessed memory
locations as inconsistant types, were discovered to slip past a
bytecode verifier correctly implemented according to Sun's
Saying that the current specification does not support formal
proofs of correctness is far different than saying that the
language itself is broken.

Again, he is not saying that the type verifier isn't correct,
merely that the materials with which to construct a proof have

Not certain, but very very likely.  Due to the restricted nature
of Java and the bytecode, the checks that need to be done are
fairly simple transitive closures of relations involving local
program structure.  While the general theory of object-oriented
runtime structures can get hairy, Java's elimination of things
like multiple inheritance makes its own corner of this universe
considerably more tractable.

I think Java, as currently specified, is going to be around for
quite a while.  I further think that the concerns expressed above
will be addressed by augmentation of the existing specifications
and by construction of the necessary proofs of correctness, and
not by drastic surgery on the language and virtual machine as
they currently exist.
In any case, the anarchy of the free market rarely takes notice
of the theoretical musings of academicians.  Until Java
experiences a catastrophic and public train wreck, people will
continue to use it and its reputation will continue to grow.

I hope everyone here realizes that Java is not just about
Applets. Applets are simply one of many abstract classes in Java,
suitable for further refinement into things that get plugged into
Web pages.
Java itself is a full-blown programming language, like C or C++,
with command line processing conventions, runtime libraries, and
all the other amenities of procedure-oriented programming
languages.  You can write anything you want in Java, and execute
the program at a shell prompt by simply typing its name followed
by some arguments.  (Perhaps you might have to alias "name" to
"java name", but you get the general idea)
While the security issues being discussed are indeed important
for Applets, where untrusted code from God-knows-where comes into
intimate contact with the program visible decor of ones platform,
they are less important when Java is used as an ordinary
programming language, in order to take advantage of its
platform-independence and incorruptable run-time structure.
Again, this is not directed at Alex or anyone else specifically,
but some of the messages I have read here recently have given the
distinct impression that people are thinking of Java as a
language solely for writing Applets, as opposed to something more
general and a bullet-proof replacement for C++ and C.
I think we'll be seeing a lot of things written in Java in the
future.  A good first start would be a set of Daemons for Unix
which run on any platform and are totally immune to the
buffer-overrun type holes which permit people to easily break
into systems.

That's one of the things that killed Thinking Machines.  It turned out
that a standard supercomputer with PIM chips for memory could give the

computation with the standard architecture redistributing data as needed
using high bandwidth scatter-gather operations and moves.
At the time Thinking Machines went under, Seymour Cray had a big contract
for Cray Computer to deliver a PIM Cray machine to the government, but he
missed some deadlines, got cancelled, and his company went down the tubes
as well.  Too bad, it would have been a nice box. BTW, I gave up trying to predict innovations after being dragged down to see an early version of Visi-Calc running on an Apple, and horribly insulting the developers with comments like "But why would anyone want to emulate a ledger sheet?" and "I hope you guys didn't spend a lot of

Most video rental by mail places, like Facets or Movies Unlimited, rent up to three tapes at once, and use a single appropriately
sized box.  I suppose they will have to start packaging each
tape separately. The typical package one sends back to a book club when they ship
you the latest pulp fiction even though you sent the little card
back in time weighs about two pounds. But, as Tim points out, there's always UPS, or one of the other
services that will pick up at your door and is happy to have your
business. The Washington Post says...
"Reacting to growing concerns about mail bombs, the Postal Service
said yesterday that it is taking the extrordinary step of prohibiting
customers from depositing any stamped packages weighing 16 ounces or
more in its collection boxes.
"Posthamster General Marvin T. Runyon said the action was being
taken to 'enhance security measures and to protect the traveling
public, postal employees, and postal contractors who transport
US mail.'"
Persons who use postage meters and mail domestically are exempt
from the new rule. (!)
So I guess if the video place sends you a metered sticker for the
return postage, you can still drop the tapes in the box. I'm not quite sure what they are trying to accomplish, other than
to leap on the "we're doing our part to inconvenience the public over

Permit me to go off in an orthogonal direction here and say that
I think that we should do away with the concept of a pre-ordained
newsgroups in Usenet entirely, in favor of an IRC-like dynamic creation of message pools.
One of the nice things about IRC is that if the Empire State
Building suddenly blows up, you can tune to  and generally
find several hundred people interested in discussing it without
having to go through some complicated newgroup/rmgroup/discussion
The real data base of Usenet is the totality of messages, indexed
by message ID, and there are so many newsgroups now that allowing
the Newsgroups: line to have arbitrary contents in the message
header would do little to increase the confusion. Entering each
arbitrary entry in the Newsgroups: line into a secondary
searchable index would provide the same functionality as we have
now with the conventional arrangement of newsgroups.
News software would certainly be free to map the Usenet hierarchy
onto a directory structure, as is done today, or to simply keep
it as a large flat database with multiple indices, or to do any
combination of the above, such as an arrangement where populated
newsgroups get their own directory, and everything else resides
in a giant directory called "/usr/spool/news/krap."
With governments creating lists of "banned" newsgroups, and an
official creation process managed by the "Cabal", Usenet is much
more vulnerable to state control than it would be if newsgroups
were simply arbitrary strings which existed somewhere in the
current window into the history file.  A newsgroup would then
exist if there were messages in it, and wouldn't exist if it had
remained unused for some reasonable period of time.
Now that search engines are becoming the best way to read Usenet
anyway, and the Newsgroups: line is just another field in a set
of search specifications, there is no reasonable reason to limit
what may be placed there to some list of "20,000" pre-defined
strings, or some government controlled subset of the above.
If Singapore bans alt.sex.hooters, you could simply post to
alt.culture.singapore.i.got.your.hooters.right.here. This
would effectly jerk the rug out from under the "banned
newsgroups" gestapo, and create a namespace so large you would
always be able to construct an appropriately suggestive new entry
in the compliment of any part that was blocked.
It would also send the correct message that "newsgroups" are
simply one of many labels on an article, and are not cyberspacial
tearooms where bad people congregate and there is guilt by
The alternative to doing something reasonable like this is
probably to see mass migration from "banned newsgroups" to
off-topic groups, like Lolita pictures in rec.pets.cats, when the
inevitable crackdown comes. As long as people can post
anonymously, they will simply switch to another existing
newsgroup when the one they are posting to becomes blocked. Once
the inevitable reciprocal pissing contest between posters and
censors gets going, Usenet as we know it will likely be

An interesting Net tidbit.  Note that the "International Conference
on Child Sexual Exploitation" in Stolkholm which served as a platform
for these accusations and various coordinated stories in numerous
media outlets is simply a circus put on by ECPAT, a well-known
pressure group whose propaganda is modeled after the now-defunct National Coalition on Pornography, and whose spurious and laughable
claims about child pornography and vast pedophile conspiracies would fill volumes.  The only odd thing here is that the mainstream press is
presenting this gathering with a perfectly straight face, as if it were
some sort of credible event, which of course it is not.    HELSINKI (Reuter) - A Finnish Internet specialist said on Friday he
   was closing his remailer, or anonymous forwarding system, after
   rejecting allegations it was being used as a conduit for child
   pornography.
   Johan Helsingius, whose remailer is one of the largest in the world
   with over half a million users, said in a statement he was closing
   down the system because the legal issues governing the Internet in
   Finland are unclear.
   ``The legal protection of users needs to be clarified. At the moment
   the privacy of Internet messages is judicially unclear,'' said
   Helsingius, who said he set up and ran the remailer in his free time
   partly as an initiative to help abused children.
   Internet remailers are computers which receive and forward messages
   with a pseudonym or anonymous source.
   There are about five large ones in the world, and they exist to enable
   anonymous discussion of sensitive subjects -- for instance by victims
   of child abuse, potential suicides or people in politically repressed
   societies.
   Helsingius, supported by Finnish police, earlier this week dismissed
   claims in Britain's Observer Sunday newspaper that his remailing
   system handled up to 90 percent of child pornography on the Internet.
   ``I have also personally been a target because of the remailer for
   three years,'' he said on Friday. ``Unjustified accusations affect
   both my job and my private life.''
   The newspaper reported the charges, by a U.S. policeman and FBI
   adviser, as Belgian police were investigating horrific child sex
   crimes and ahead of an international conference in Stockholm on the
   commercial sexual exploitation of children.
   In Helsingius's statement, Helsinki police sergeant Kaj Malmberg was
   quoted as saying he had found no evidence of child porn being
   transmitted from Finland.

I think you have to look at the balance between two things.
First, there is the effect of making the material more widely
available and publicized than it was prior to the attempted
censorship.  This effect is definitely real.  Indeed, prior to a
few days ago, I wouldn't have known a Zundelsite from a hole in
the ground.
Second, however, is the unprecedented opportunity for people
running mirrors to guarantee that large numbers of the public
will encounter said material for the first time enveloped within
their chosen "context wrapper."
Now it is well known that the crafty art of propaganda rarely
consists of deliberate falsehoods, like "yellow rain" or "spy
dust".  It mostly consists of making sure one is in complete
control of the circumstances in which potentially damaging
information is disclosed.
The opportunity to present Mr. Zundel's views brightly
gift-wrapped in paper bearing the legend - "Here are the
offensive views of a hate-mongering Nazi whose victims are
supporting his right to be heard" - is worth more than a thousand
press releases denouncing Mr. Zundel by the anti-defamation
I would expect that it is this second effect which predominates,
and therefore the proliferation of mirror sites is in fact a
victory for Mr. Zundel's detractors, and not a promotion of Mr.
Zundel's views.

The ad overstates the result a bit. :)
You may recall, a few years back, that there was some interest in
the possibility that the non-local collapse of a quantum
mechanical wave function could be used to transmit information in
violation of causality, that is, faster than the speed of light.
The central idea was this.  You generate a system consisting of
two things whose wavefunctions are correlated, and after they
have separated some distance, you perform a measurement which
collapses the wavefunction of one of them and yields some result.
This might be the polarization of a photon, the spin of a
particle along some axis, or where on a photographic plate an ion
will strike after passing through a Stern-Gerlach device.
Since the wavefunctions are correlated, you now know the exact
same information about the twin system and have collapsed its
wavefunction non-locally without directly performing a
measurement on it.  This general notion is known as the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen(EPR) Effect, and measurements of
canonically conjugate variables on branch systems having a
spacelike separation give a unique result according to Quantum
Mechanics which is distinct from the classical case and which
requires this superluminal transmission of wavefunction
Now actually building an apparatus which does such a thing is
tricky, since light moves pretty fast, but a few years back, this
result was experimentally confirmed with a device that produced
photons with correlated spins moving in opposite directions, and
managed to make measurements that were instantaneous enough to be
spacelike in separation.
Unfortunately, the scientists found that there was no way to use
the EPR Effect to transmit information, since although the
measurements made had a correlation, you needed the information
from the original system to decode the output of the other in a
meaningful way.
Now on to IBM's result.  Although the EPR Effect cannot be used
to transmit information (read the results of measurements), it
can be used to transmit mixed quantum states, which an attempt at
measurement would destroy.  So if you haven't measured something,
and it's value is indeterminate for a system, then you can tunnel
that unmeasured something anywhere else using the EPR Effect and
measure it there.
The general method for such teleporation is as follows.  You
create an "entangled" pair of particles whose wavefunctions are
perfectly correlated and unmeasured.  One interacts with the
particle to be teleported and the other at some distance
interacts with another identical particle to which you wish to
transfer the state of the first.  Everything is arranged so that
the state of the teleported particle is destroyed by interaction
with the first of the pair of particles, and it twin, perfectly
correlated with the first and inheriting its state via the EPR
Effect, transfers that captured state to the copy.
Now this has some interesting implications.  One of the problems
with teleportation devices in Science Fiction stories is that
they allow for the creation of duplicates.  They reduce an object
to a pattern by measuring it, and then recreate it at a distance
by assembling atoms of the same types according to the
appropriate directions.  There is no theoretical reason why, once
the pattern has been saved, this process could not be repeated
multiple times.  This has implications for things like souls and
self-awareness that many people would rather not think about.
The preceeding method for teleporting mixed quantum states does
not have such a problem, since only things which have not been
measured can be transferred in such a way, and the duplicate can
only be created if the original has been destroyed.  If
consciousness is truly a phenomena involving quantum mechanical
superposition, then we need never worry about being replicated,
and the "transporter accidents" of Star Trek are forever
relagated to the realm of fiction.
In any case, it should be noted that this method works at present
only with single particles, and not with large aggregate systems
like Goulash.  Extending it to systems would appear to be an
intractable engineering problem given current technology.

Which is patently silly, of course.  Unless some TLA writes me an
obscenely large check, I am unlikely to try and break anything
that hasn't achieved significant market penetration and
widespread use, whether it is an operating system, or an
application which utilizes encryption.
I'm not even interested in breaking the individual building
blocks of such things, such as block ciphers and RNGs, outside of
the context of their use in a specific application.  Unless
something is obviously braindead on delivery, it makes little
sense to attack it in the abstract, and the nicest weaknesses in
systems often depend upon the little details, as the Netscape and
Kerberos folk have discovered.
All of this means that challenges by the snake oil peddlers, and
even well-advertised public floggings of new ciphers, like RC5,
really don't do much to discover design flaws or weaknesses. It's
like the ten people who post "I have invented an unbreakable
cipher" to sci.crypt each week, and when no one cares, proudly
declare victory and go home.

Netcom has not removed access to the alt groups, but they have

A few quick comments.  The notion that one might be able to
compute digits of Pi efficiently at any starting point in the
number is not late-breaking news.  The Chudnovsky brothers
developed a formula which permitted them to do this a number of
years ago, and used it to compute Pi to several billion digits.
Prior to that time, the Borweins' quartic interation based on
Ramanujan's modular identities and AGM techniques was the
existing state of the art.
Given a base, d, and an finite ordinal, i, the function which
computes the ith digit of the Pi in the base d is certainly a
computable one.  If we can find an algorithm for computing this
function whose time as a function of "i" does not include the
time required to compute all previous digits, then we are to a
certain extent evaluating individual digits of Pi without
calculating the previous ones.
One should keep in mind, however, that the degree to which such
things are true for algorithms lies on a continuum, with a
near-constant number of arithmetic operations at one end, and a
geometric progression at the other.  So it is not the classic
either/or situation.  Good algorithms whose times are tractable
functions of "i" are certainly desirable, and have been
Someone suggested that radix conversion was a time-consuming
operation.  Modern FFT-based algorithms can do multiplication,
division, Nth root, reciprocal, and base conversion in
near-linear time.
Doubtless good algorithms to compute the Nth digit of Pi in any
base do exist, but their form may not be as obvious as those for
trivial bases, such as powers of two.

That property would be possessed by any self-correcting iteration
which converged in a neighborhood of Pi.  It would not be
necessary to repeat ones earlier calculations at increased
precision in order to determine Pi to additional digits.  One
could just use the previous calculations as a starting point and
continue to iterate, doing the new calculations to extended
I believe the Chudnovskys proved a much stronger result than
this, although precisely what it was escapes me at the moment.
[Please hum the theme to "Final Jeopardy" while I look up
 Chudnovsky's formula]
Good - it's in the sci.math FAQ.
Set k_1 = 545140134
    k_2 = 13591409
    k_3 = 640320
    k_4 = 100100025
    k_5 = 327843840
    k_6 = 53360;
Then pi = (k_6 sqrt(k_3))/(S), where
S = sum_(n = 0)^oo (-1)^n ((6n)!(k_2 +nk_1))/(n!^3(3n)!(8k_4k_5)^n)
This converges linearly at about 14 digits a term, and carries
forward a sufficiently small amount of state that one can iterate
into the billions of digits without the CPU requirements becoming
painful.  So it basically functions as a digit generator for Pi,
which, when appropriately initialized, will work on any part of
the number and emit the appropriate output.  The denominator
simplifies in a special way which keeps the computation localized
to a small neighborhood of the place where the new digits are

I guess you're right about it not having the specific form of a
function which takes "i" as input and emits the "ith" bit.
Nonetheless, the discovery of this particular formula and the
way in which its computational requirements expand tastefully
with increasing numbers of digits hints strongly at the existence
of the aforementioned closed solution.

Before anyone takes this nonsense too seriously, one should
realize that the exhibition of such microscopic views of
technology by journalists and politicians is fairly common.
Who can forget Caspar Weinburger's stirring speech in front of an
illegally exported low-end VAX, explaining that the machine was a
sophisticated electronic device for the tracking of missiles and
troop movements, now in the hands of America's enemies.
Then there was the newspaper article which explained in perfect
seriousness that "GIF" was a secret computer code used by child
molesters to encode images of their victims.
Characterizing PGP as a neo-Nazi tool for private communications
written by a sympathizer, while absurd in a larger sense, is
hardly sillier than the prior examples.  And all such scenarios
contain a microscopic grain of truth as seen by someone somewhere
with a severe case of tunnel vision.
The reporter no doubt reports correctly that some neo-Nazis use
PGP to communicate privately.  Doubtless PKZ supports the right
of all people, including those with diverse political views, to
conduct legal private conversations which cannot be overheard by
their governments, as do most of the people on this list.  I
suppose in some obtuse sense this is sympathy.

As I understand it, the basic concept behind the V-Chip is to
allow selective blocking of material a particular viewer might
find offensive based on content information transmitted along
with the program.  As long as the program material itself is
transmitted unaltered, and there are multiple non-governmental
providers of content descriptions catering to the spectrum of
human likes and dislikes, this sounds like ideal Cypherpunk
Concerned Parent can set the V-Chip to read from the Children's
Television Workshop content service, available for a small
monthly fee, and be certain that graphic violence and sex are
pixelated on screen, and that bleep words that the child might
practice in front of Grandma are garbled.
Mr. Islamic Fanatic can filter out all blasphemy against Allah
and his one and only prophet, pork commercials, and women showing
more than 100 square centimeters of exposed epidermis.  Uncle
Ernie can program his set to beep loudly when shots of nude
adolescent boys are about to appear in foreign films.  Everyone
has a filter which they can tune for their own viewing and
listening enjoyment, and a free market system of content
description services will cater to every conceivable taste.
What are the dangers of this new technology?
First, the government might want only one description of content,
which it controls.  My notion of what is offensive probably
differs greatly from that of Jesse Helms, for instance.
Second, once content descriptions become available, they might be
used to control content at the transmission end, not the viewing
end.  Congress could mandate that the same information that Uncle
Ernie uses to alert himself to "interesting" scenes, be used at
the transmitting end to pixelate the same material. V-Chips for
consumer products are our friend. V-Chips for broadcasters and
publishers are not.
It should be noted that the V-Chip is currently vaporware, and
exists only in the minds of politicians.  There probably will
never be an actual "V-Chip", just a little additional software in
our already heavily computerized televisions, radios, and
personal computers.
One desirable side effect of the V-Chip.  It will probably have
the effect of extinguishing hysterical reactions to nudity, sex,
bleep words, and special effects violence, by allowing people to
gradually increase what they are exposed to as they become
tolerant of it.  Sort of the opposite of aversion therapy.
Perhaps in the distant future, the population will wonder what
the thing was ever used for, and why anyone bothered to develop

For Usenet, a similar function is provided automatically by
search engines.  This is why I almost always read news now using
Alta Vista.  The database is updated with new articles in real
time, and I can use any label I choose (i.e. search criteria) to
find material in my chosen subject areas across all newsgroups.
In some sense, search engines are automatic labeling devices for
Usenet traffic.  I find them useful.  With a few more orders of
magnitude computing power, such technology could easily be
applied to audiovisual material as well.

Yes.  Voluntary labeling of publicly available information, or
services which permit selection of such information based on
personal criteria, is a Good Thing(tm).
Government labeling of publicly available information and laws
which mandate the use of such labels at the distribution end are
a Bad Thing(tm).

A nice example of this in the private sector is TV Guide's
labeling of cable movies by content.  This goes beyond the MPAA
rating and includes such terms as "strong language", "nudity",
"violence", "adult themes", and "sexual situations." Were TV
Guide available in computer readable form, one could easily grep
the guide based on such keyphrases and plot summaries to find
everything from "DuckTales" to "Marilyn Chambers' Bikini Bistro."

Right.  Freedom of TV viewing belongs to those who own one, even

Exactly like freedom of the press.

The last great adventure in forcing manufacturers to put
something in a television set was the "UHF must tune as easily as
VHF" boondoggle.  The number of UHF stations in most areas was
0-1. Note that when cable provided a plethora of channels in a
previously untunable part of the spectrum, market forces
instantly resulted in the creation of "cable-ready" sets in
advance of government prodding.

There is currently no official standard for encoding content
information for television programs.  Manufacturers of various
flavors of "parental control devices" have at times demonstrated
their technology as the "V-Chip" on Network Nightly News
programs. This includes devices which can do selective
pixelation, as well as those which merely render the set
inoperative during programs having a specific rating.
The bandwidth required to transmit content information second by
second is very small. It is not a foregone conclusion that such
information will be carried exclusively via the video blanking
intervals, or that it will be available from only a single
source. Indeed, with the movement towards digital encoding of
television, it is doubtful that blanking intervals themselves
will be around much longer.

No one is suggesting that all raters will rate all programming.
Movies will probably be the first things raters will provide
content tracks for.  Next will be widely carried programs in
syndicated reruns, and top rated first run shows.
Eventually, use of the technology will proliferate, much as the
use of closed-captioning has.
Much money will be saved in not having to physically edit media,
and in having the intelligence at the displaying end. One will no
longer have to have a theatrical release of a movie, a television
version, a version for European airlines, a version for American
airlines, a version for Islamic airlines, etc ad nauseum.  Porn
will no longer have to be edited into Hard-X, Soft-X, and R
versions before being distributed.

Please see prior comments about Nightly News demonstrations of
alleged V-Chip technology.
Once a standard for encoding content information is established,
it is unlikely that there will be some universal specific
"V-Chip" that will be used by all manufacturers.  Instead, the
functionality will likely be implemented in whatever software
controls the display appliance.  It's not a complicated
application, and hardly worth a processor of its own.

This would be killing a mosquito with a flyswatter. Besides, the

little cubicles with guns to their heads.
A somewhat more civilized method is used by my broker, who gets
audited on a regular schedule by one of the major accounting
firms.  The accounting firm puts an insert into every statement
periodically, with an envelope addressed to the accounting firm,
asking the customer to carefully examine the enclosed statement
and to contact them if it is not entirely accurate.

I would trust the typical customer to mail back a form to an
outside auditor far more than I would trust him to examine a hash
tree, check his own entry, check the neighborhood of his own
entry for cryptographic integrity, and sound an alarm.
To be perfectly candid, I would not even want the task of
explaining to the typical banking customer what a hash tree was.
The outside auditor can of course be spoofed by giving him access
only to some subset of customer accounts.  The hash tree can be
spoofed by not telling a subset of customers of its existance.
All things considered, I think I would prefer the auditor.

Since "Holocaust" is an Operational Definition referencing Jewish
experience during the Second World War, there is a clearly
tautological aspect to the oft-posed question "Did the Holocaust
happen?", to which the answer is obviously, a priori, and
identically, "Yes", in the sense that Jews did, indeed, live
during the Second World War, and some of them did indeed, like
numerous other minority religous, ethnic, and political groups,
have experiences which would not be described as recreational in
Armed with a question whose answer is true by construction, it is
not very hard to correctly characterize those arguing that the
answer is "false" as crackpots, and only a tiny leap from there
to characterizing those who ask different and reasonable
questions as having asked the Canonical Question instead and
having also given the wrong answer to it.
It is of course then necessary to censor the ability of the
public to view the original questions, since this would not only
cast aspersions upon ones credibility, but would also require
that they be answered, the avoidance of which was the reason for
the original exercise in misdirection.
While such political tactics work well in a world with a
traditional hierarchical flow of information from the Big Press
to the Little Citizen-Unit, they collapse completely under the
Cooperative Anarchy of the Net, and blow up in the faces of those
who attempt them.
The Simon Wiesenthal Center desparately needs to regroup and try
to understand how the Net works, before applying its traditional
methods of debate and advocacy to an environment where completely
different rules apply.  This is not to deny the Holocaust, or to
say that the SWC doesn't have its heart in the right place.  This
is simply an attempt to spare them any more self-inflicted

Many people are likely to think this based on the Germans

It is interesting to note that there is no specific law
prohibiting free speech for Holocaust Agnostics in Germany. The
actual laws under which such cases are prosecuted are libel laws,
which have been liberally interpreted to mean that one may not
"libel" deceased Jews as a class or their memory in the minds of
their surviving relatives.
The notion of libeling a class of deceased persons strikes me as
a dangerous and particularly convoluted legal fiction. (Although
I certainly don't mean any disrespect for the deceased or their
survivors when I say this.)

The solution to Mr. Zundel is the same as the solution to
Archemedes (Ne Ludvig) Plutonium.  Allow him complete freedom of
speech to express his theories, debunk him as time permits, and
if all else fails, put him in your killfile.
The chances that Mr. Zundel will organize a Fourth Reich are
about the same as those that Archmedes Plutonium will force us
all to do our mathematics with his N-Adics.  It's not something
I'm going to spend a lot of time worrying about.

Regardless of what one wishes to call such a term, there are
obvious dangers to using shorthand, abbreviations, OD's,
acronyms, and other such things as if they possessed predictive
power, or some magical ability to explain the things they
reference by virtue of their construction.  It is of course even
sillier to question their existence.
If I define "Salz Syndrome" as a tendency by people named "Rich"
to post messages suggesting that discussions of Holocaust
semantics are off-topic for the Cypherpunks list, then I have to
a certain extent stacked the deck when rhetorically asking
questions like...
     Why does Rich post such messages?
Or when I answer a question about the legitimacy of Saltz
Syndrome as a real disease by feigning surprise and saying
indignantly - "Surely you are not suggesting Saltz Syndrome
doesn't exist!?"
By the same token, I don't feel "Did the Holocaust happen?" is a
particularly well-formed or useful question. The answer, by
almost any criteria, is most certainly "Yes", and answering the
question tells me nothing I didn't know before I asked it.
All of this is of course orthogonal to the point I was trying to
make, which is that while such flaws of logic and debate go
largely unnoticed in the unconnected world, and often result in
the winning of debates, they generally get flamed royally on the
Net, where a different set of rules apply.

Other Arab states had mutual defense treaties with Iraq which
would have obligated them to enter the war on the side of Iraq
were there a conflict between Iraq and Israel.  This would have
greatly complicated the Persian Gulf War, and put the United

The sad part is that Israel required any persuasion or guarantees

This, of course, is justified by the psychiatric profession's
invention of dozens of bogus diseases, syndromes, and disorders
for children.  These are not caused by any organic pathology, of
course, but are instead defined solely by the child belonging to
the upper five percent of those exhibiting perfectly normal
behaviors which annoy people who have money to hire
psychiatrists.  For kids, that's parents and teachers, and the
afflicted population jumps to ten percent if you happen to be a
kid unlucky enough to be under the care of Mormons.
Refuse to go to a crappy public school and you are suffering from
"School Phobia." Don't jump to follow the orders of the nearest
adult, or disagree with an adult, and its "Oppositional-Defiant"
Disorder.  Not to mention the plethora of ADD/ADDH nonsense that
is used to label any kid who is bored to tears by eight hours a
day of political indoctrination from the NEA and AFT.
Drugs for the poor, and therapy for the rich who can afford it,
are of course the way the psychiatric profession offers to "cure"
these invented maladies.  And since every population of children
will have an upper five percent (ten percent, for Mormons), a
neverending supply of patients is assured.

This Soviet-style "Medicalization of Dissent", while applied

an official mental disorder whose symptoms were "an abnormal
desire for freedom" on the part of a Black man.  Slave owners
must have been just as happy with that as Ritalin-dispensing
parents and teachers are today.

There are, of course, real mental illnesses with underlying
pathology, like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and clinical
I'm not sure the existence of genuine mental illness makes the
psychiatric profession credible, however, when they are all too

Goodness gracious, you make these people sound almost reasonable.
I remember last year one local TV station did a piece on "school
phobia", and the wonderful drugs that could be used to treat it.
The kid profiled simply didn't like school, and refused to attend
it, and the list of symptoms given to help parents recognize the
disorder were entirely attendance related.
Of course, with enough Mellaril in your system, you can probably
put up with just about anything.

ADD people are simply the upper 5-10% of the population with
regard to behavioral traits which make learning more difficult.
Of course such things can be hereditary and of course people who
can't live up to expectations placed upon them sometimes get
clinically depressed.
The thing to remember here is that we are looking at things which
show continuous normal variation in any population, like height
and hatsize, and the people who are being labeled and treated
here are hardly some huge number of standard deviations away from
the norm.

Insanity is a legal term which by its very construction, is an

with any scientific definition of mental illness.  You can be
completely bonkers and carrying on meaningful conversations with

Perry Writes:
Since diabetes has an organic cause, this analogy with syndromes and
disorders defined solely by behavioral percentages fails.
A better model might be height, which follows a basically continuous
distribution once outliers due to functional endocrine problems are
eliminated. We could, of course, define a "vertical deficit disorder" (VDD) which
10% of the population have by definition, and for which the treatment
would be synthetic human growth hormone given regularly during the
growing years. People with VDD would probably want to be taller, and be as successful
as their peers at important things like basketball.  The specified treatment would certainly demonstrate effectiveness in accomplishing
this goal.  People with VDD would argue that their disease was real, since it was hereditary, and could be measured with complex scientific
instrumentation, like PET^H^H^HYardsticks.
Nonetheless, reputable scientists usually only perscribe HGH for persons
many standard deviations away from the norm, or who have medical disorders
which interfere with normal production of the substance.  Any doctor who
started handing out perscriptions to everyone in the shortest 10%
of the population would probably be up on malpractice charges posthaste. Amphetamines have demonstrated themselves to be a tricky medication even
for psychological disorders for which they were once considered appropriate.  ADD and its treatment plays very well into a society that
seems to feel that each and every one of life's misfortunes must be
given a name and called a disease. Of course, no amount of reason will disuade the True Believers from
embracing yet another disease model, and we shouldn't expect that it would.  But I think it is clear to many people that the forced medication
of children for the convenience of those who take care of them is
getting a bit out of control.

The point was that the group with endocrine problems was an
appropriate group to give growth hormone to, whereas the shortest
10% of the population was not.
Similarly while there might very well be some disorder of
cognition for which amphetamines would be appropriate medication,
prescribing them on the basis of which 10% of the population
performs least well in the traditional "cells and bells" school
environment is not it.
The fact that some claim to be able to demonstrate ADD by
"repeatable biological tests" carries no more weight than the
ability to repeatably demonstrate that a person is short of
stature by "repeatable tape measure tests."

There is a difference between giving medication for a verifiable
organic problem, like insulin for diabetes, or growth hormone for
a pituitary defect, and giving it to the 10% shortest, or the 10%
most likely to call their teachers bleep words.

Again, to return to the height analogy, doctors have to throw
short parents seeking human growth hormone for their perfectly
healthy short children off their doorsteps every day.
Same goes for patients seeking antibiotics inappropriate for
their illnesses, and countless other things.
The price of giving the patient (or the patient's parents)
everything they want is disease-resistant microorganisms, a
country where everyone is over six feet tall, and classrooms full
of obedient citizen-units in Soma-induced trances.

Even thinking about math shows up on a PET scan.  Nothing

You seem to feel that if something can be detected

of measurement too.
Being able to reliably tell people apart based on some fallacious

No.  I would look at the population distribution.  If it was
smooth and continuous and similar to other distributions
associated with continuous normal variation of physical
characteristics, I certainly wouldn't call it a disease.
If some poor soul was sitting five standard deviations away from
the norm, with a verifiable organic problem, then the hypothesis
of disease would certainly be one worthy of investigation.

Depression is a normal human emotion as long as it is related to
something sad in ones environment.  Depression becomes a disease
only when serious and inappropriate self-destructive behavior is
likely, or when the mental state becomes endogenous, and
unrelated to ones circumstances.
Again, if I tried to define depression as "The least happy 33% of
the population", that would be silly, regardless of whether true
clinical depression existed.

Medicating a disease is fine.  Recreational uses of relatively
harmless intoxicants and are also fine.  It is the inappropriate
use of strong medicines with serious side effects by clueless
people for vague criteria like "reaching his or her potential"
that I have a problem with.

Again, I said that one should NEVER define a disease solely by
percentages and subjective behavioral observations.  Not that 10%
was some sort of dividing point in doing so.
Again, no one would try and define heart disease by the
subjective observations of suddenly dropping dead, or of claiming
chest pain.  You would be lumping lots of diseases into one and

Sorry, Perry.  It is perfectly normal for blood pressure to vary
all over the range for which medication is given.  Some people
need medication, others are just hyper because they hate going to
the doctor, or because the elevator was broken and they just ran
up several flights of stairs.
Some of these people have vascular damage.  Others do not.
Again, we don't simply measure blood pressure and give pills to
the people who fall in the top X%.  Pressure anomalies have many
many causes, and doctors do complete workups and a differential
diagnosis, based on the best models of disease processes they
have available, before prescribing medication.

Some people would make the same claim for small doses of opiates.

I will never take Tylenol.
Acetaminophen is an interesting compound.  It is a potent
hepatotoxin, but is broken down "just in time" by liver enzymes
when it is taken in small quantities.  Hence it usually doesn't
kill you.
The Catch-22 here is that people whose livers are impaired for
various reasons may not be able to metabolize it before it does
its damage, and their livers may be destroyed.  These people may
not have any other symptoms which indicate to them that they have
liver disease.
There have been a number of cases of liver damage requiring
transplantation, one which involved taking only a couple of
tablets more than the recommended daily dose.
Coincidentally, one of the morning shows had a piece today on a
baby that required a liver transplant for a Tylenol overdose,
just before I read your message.  Seems the package of Tylenol
said to consult a physician for the correct dosage if a child was
under two years of age.  The mom called the doctor and he gave
her the dosage for "Children's Tylenol." The mother,
unfortunately, was using "Infant Tylenol", which is slightly more
concentrated, and the baby lost her liver as a result of this
unfortunate miscomunication.
Despite the marketing hype, the risks of acetaminophen just
aren't worth it for a medication whose only purpose is to serve
as a mild analgesic.

If I had kids, I would be overjoyed that the new technology of
the information age permitted them to investigate any topic of
their choice in the safety of their own home.  Of course, there
would be some reasonable limits during their very early years, if
only to prevent them from waking up screaming in the middle of
the night, but I expect most of these could be eliminated by the
time they reached their early teens.
If I had kids, I am sure Tim would support my right to give them
access to the entire universe of human knowlege and thought as
early as possible, and to let them form their own opinions on
every conceivable subject, even if those opinions differed from
my own.  Where I suspect we differ, is that I would not only
advocate such an advantage for my kids, but for his as well.
The problem with giving parents the absolute right to control
their childrens' input of memes until the children are too old
and stupid to learn anything new, is that it creates generational
propagation of obsolete ideologies.  All the Dole children think
exactly like Bob.  All the Hitler children think exactly like
Adolf.  Same for the Mengele children, the Nixon children, the
Stalin children, the Netanyahu children, etc...

Before the days of home computers and filters, we had things
called public libraries.  They provided all citizens with
unfiltered access to information of their choice, even children.
Members of the American Library Association are pretty good at
torching paper trails of what people choose to read, and allowing
children who have reached the age of reason access to almost
everything in the library, as long as they don't talk too loudly
or stick gum to the seats.  Parents may not like this, but up
until now, the librarians have stood their ground.
The movement towards accessing information from home PCs, coupled
with the new "parents rights" movement and filtering software,
creates a situation where no one under the age of 18 can have
access to any information their parents don't want them to see.
As the Web replaces the library, young people won't even be able
to preserve the same anonymous access to controversial
information they have always had in the past.  This is a step
backwards for youth rights.

I certainly believe that the education dollar should be in the
hands of the education consumer, that the NEA and the AFT should
be splintered into a million pieces and scattered to the winds,
and that providing educational services should become a
competitive business run with the efficiency of Federal Express.

bad speech is more speech.  Older kids can make up their own
minds about such things after hearing all sides, including their
parents', and younger kids generally take what is said at home at
face value anyway.

As an individual who has no desire to engage in gay sex, or watch
it being performed while I am eating, I must admit my attitudes
towards the "gay community" have undergone a certain evolution in
recent years.  Back in the '70s, gays supported a wide-ranging
platform of human rights issues, and a lot of activists whose
work I admired on many issues I supported "happened to be gay."
Now that the gay community has narrowed its focus solely to the
issue of consensual adult sodomy rights, and shown alarming signs
of sucking up to the Radical Religious Right, I really don't have
warm feelings towards it anymore.  They have marginalized many of
their former supporters and seem more interested in pleasing
Jesse Helms than in showing anything resembling ideological
integrity.  I really believe the gay movement of today would sell
out almost anyone if they thought it would guarantee the right of
homosexual men to join the Republican Party and plug each others
assholes in private in the community of their choice.
A right I support, of course, as long as I don't have to watch it
or pay for it.

I'm not sure this is "evolution in action", as much as the "law
of unintended consequences." Kind of like feeding ground up sheep
to cows and discovering that the brains of hamburger eaters are
turning to swiss cheese.  Not a morality issue at all.
Homosexual transmission of HIV is not the significant vector in
most of the world anyway, with the exception of the US and a few
other countries where the virus happened by pure accident to find
its way into a high risk population.

Piaget was very good at "proving" how fundamentally different the
minds of children were from those of adults, and at constructing
elaborate webs of complex terminology and doctrine to support his
Unfortunately, his experiments suffered from obvious flaws.  I
recall one in which he trained a child to relate the terms "more"
and "less" to whether the same amount of fluid was poured into a
taller or shorter container.  Piaget concluded that this
demonstrated that children have no quantitative skills.  Others
had a less flattering description of the research, and realized
that all Piaget had accomplished was to teach his subjects
incorrect meanings for a few common words.  Similar defects can
be found is most of his other constructs, and better designed
experiments do not demonstrate the effects he claimed.

Again, we are applying a standard to the Net which has never been
applied to libraries.  Any orthodox Jewish child can read all he
or she wants in a library about the wonders of pig-eating,
without any possibility of parental supervision or disclosure of
their un-Jewish interests.
But it is now being advocated that on the Net, no child has a
right to view even a syllable of any information their parents do
not want them to see.  While gay or bestial sex is frequently the
excuse for such antics, it is clear that parents will be using
this new technology to impose a level of control over their
childrens' minds which has heretofore never been possible.  This
should worry us all.

Generally, very young children do not have the neural wiring in
place to suspend emotional reactions to imagery based on
intellectual considerations. Seeing an picture of someone being
hurt in a movie causes them the same emotional pain as seeing
someone hurt in real life, even though they may know perfectly
well that the former image is fictional in nature.
Almost all children develop this important critical faculty by
the age of 12, by which point, they manage to only be sickened by
the evening news, and not by the latest "Nightmare on Elm Street"
While limiting the "horizons" of persons in their middle to late
teens is often justified by arguments about developmental stages,
the truth is that it is simply an attempt by their keepers to
control how they think and to what views, mostly political and
social in nature, they are exposed to.

This is the usual smokescreen the "parents rights" lobby brings
to the bargaining table.  Rather than make the debate over the
rights of the child, and what resources the state should make
available to the child to protect those rights, they make it a
contest between the parent and the state to see who gets to
violate the child's rights the most.  Since most people regard
parents as more benevolent than the state towards children, the
parents automatically win without the reasonableness of their
behavior ever coming under discussion.
So instead of arguing whether children should have access to
education, libraries, computers, and other resources in their own
right, we get the usual endless debate over whether the state or
the parent should exercise the absolute iron-fisted control
parents all seem to think is such a wonderful thing, with
anything other than state collaboration with the parents wishes
being represented as the state usurping the parental role.
Been there.  Done that.  And as the Scottish would say, "It's

Again, children have a right to go to libraries, get educated,
and use telecommunications resources without interference by
EITHER the state or their parents.  As is usual, the people who
are against children having these rights try to sell everyone the
notion that the only choice is between their two handpicked and
equally unacceptable alternatives - iron-fisted state control or
iron-fisted parental control of everything children do.
We see the same rhetoric at work with things like curfew laws as
well.  The question is always phrased as "should the state or the
parents set curfews." Whereas, the real question is "Should
police or parents have the right to harrass a 17 year old who is
out in public, behaving himself, simply because it is 9 PM at
The best way to raise "Fewer Hitlers" is to have a generation of
children who lack the internalized rage produced by being walked

Every doctrine has its followers, and I will admit "Piaget-Speak"

dismissing childrens' concerns.
That hardly means I agree with your basic point, which is that
parents should be able to do whatever they want in controlling
their childrens' information sources without their children
having any recourse against them.

This, of course, varies with local statutes, as does the legal
definition of "In Loco Parentis." Generally it applies to
teachers, people hired to care for children, and some relatives,
such as grandparents.  I am not familar with any locale where
librarians are specifically mentioned, and most librarians will
be more than happy to explain to you that a library is not a free
babysitting service, and that they are not caregivers.

Most libraries let "young adults" (read anyone who has hit their
teenage years) read pretty much anything they want.  "Parents on
the warpath" have managed to apply pressure in recent years, and
libraries are a bit less free than they used to be, but I think
the American Library Association has done a pretty good job in
standing its ground against agitators and pressure groups.

No - I stated in my original message that young children do need
some reasonable constraints to guard them from exposure to
material which might cause them emotional pain.
This is far different from your assertion that minors (everyone
under 18) should have no access to any information that their
parents do not pre-approve.

Nothing subtle about it David.  Once young people have passed
through early childhood, the burden of proof is on anyone who
suggests that they should be insulated from social and political
reality to provide a convincing reason why. Parental
capriciousness doesn't qualify.

Parse the sentence again.  What it says is that although
"protecting children" is often the excuse used to limit older
childrens' access to controversial material, the reality is that
it is usually an effort to control their thinking on certain
issues by making sure they have only one viewpoint, that of their

needs to be controlled being a foregone conclusion.

Librarians have no role to "manage" anyones reading.  They are
there to assist patrons in locating the materials of their
choice. The Library "Bill of Rights" does not specify ANY age
limits for services provided to library patrons.

You are the one who mentioned Piaget.  Had you read my original
message accurately, you would have seen that unlimited access to
information was recommended once persons had entered their
teenage years.  There was no suggestion that very young children
should be given access to material they might find disturbing.

No, actually it has to do with attempts by parents and religious
agitators to control what young people may see in a library, like
taking "Playboy" off the periodical rack, for instance, and
requiring it to be signed out from behind the counter by those
over 18.  Such attempts have increased in number in recent years,
and some have actually been successful.

Stating that very young children may require some guidance in
their choice of reading and viewing material is not a statement
that older minors should also be interfered with in this regard.
Your suggestion that this is implied because it is an example of
tailoring material to age, of which the first is also an example,
is a clear case of incorrect abstraction from the general to the

Many perfectly good social models have been trashed by the
excesses of history.  Eugenics will most certainly always be
associated in the public mind with anti-Semitism, and slavery
with racism against Blacks.
Modern slavery, if there were such a thing, would probably be
pretty benevolent.  Anyone would be able to sell themselves into
slavery, and anyone would be able to buy their way out of it.
Slave owners would be responsible for a slave's health care,
education, recreation, pocket money, retirement income, and would
not be able to hit, verbally abuse, or work their slaves more
than a certain number of hours a day.  They would also not be
able to break up families.
Slaves would undoubtedly be able to vote, have their own powerful
union, and a track record for suing owners who didn't toe the
Slavery would be a popular with homeless people, and with young
people forced to live in toxic home environments.  No parent
would want the public shame of having their child choose slavery
over living at home.
Many people might even prefer the lifestyle, with a guaranteed
standard of living absent any worries about job security, money,
or competition.  Just get up and put in an honest day's work, and
all your needs are taken care of.  The expense of downtime is the
owner's problem.
There would be certain vocations, like Cobol programming, which
would be especially suited to being performed by slaves.
Microsoft would probably own thousands of contented slaves, who
would sing happily as they wrote code.
"Manufactured 100% by slave labor" would be a cherished label,
and the people who bought such products would know that their
money was going to help eliminate many social ills, like
homelessness, unemployment, foster care, and revenues for the
public school system.  Kathie Lee Gifford would have to defend
herself for not owning enough slaves to make her proper
contribution to the community. But I digress... :)

What you really want to do to sweep the DES keyspace is to
"schedule" the input and output block you are testing, performing
any static operations, and do only enough computation to see that
a given key fails.  Special purpose assembler to do this
particular function would probably run faster than any algorithm
which could also be employed to encrypt data.

This is actually a problem I plan to analyze someday. Looking at
single DES as a function of the key bits with the input and
output fixed.  This can be viewed as a boolean function, whose
result depends upon whether the given key works to map the input
onto the output.  Viewing this function as a composition of
single bit operations and optimizing it would perhaps lead to
insights on how best to compute it on a typical 32 bit CPU with
the usual collection of operations.
A messy little project, but probably one worth doing if I get
some free time.
Single DES is certainly ripe for a spectacular public failure.  A
little analytic work could bring breaking it within range of
available computing power.  If you are going to use regular
encryption code to brute force the keyspace, then it probably is
just a tad beyond reach at this point.

Since the courts have said that humans under 18 are not "persons"

anything, to not let him think for himself, and to not let him

The problem that I would have with boobytrapping my home is that

This is definitely the way to go when trying to break a block
cipher on the Net.  Partitioning out sieving works well for
distributed factoring only because verfying the submitted
relations requires a trivial amount of computer time compared
that expended in locating them.  There is no way for a central
server to verify a claim that a chunk of DES keyspace has been
thoroughly searched without a key being found, and it only takes
one bozo or saboteur to spoil the effort.
At triple the non-overlapping search time, we get about a 5%
chance of failure.  At quadruple, this falls to slightly less

Given that we might embark upon this public demonstration of the
fragility of single DES, what should we use for test data?
If a lone Cypherpunk simply encrypts a file with DES-ECB, hides
the key in a drawer, and publishes the cyphertext and plaintext
for use in a distributed cracking effort, there will of course
be the suggestion that the exercise was rigged, and any public
policy implications will be lost in the endless "Was So/Was Not"
quibbling which will undoubtedly take place after the crack is
Given that most of the people currently singing the praises of
single DES live in the banking industry, which has so far
resisted all reasonable suggestions that it is time for them to
move to something stronger, it would seem almost obvious that
this crack should be done on some form of live financial data,
such as might be obtained if one were to capture bits passing
over publicly accessible phone lines between various financial
institutions, ATM machines, and centralized computer facilities.
The ideal data would be replete with prepended fixed headers
which could be used as a wedge for a known plaintext attack, and
should be sufficiently sensitive that breaking it will result in
scandalous tabloid headlines and numerous opportunities for
Cypherpunks to promote their policy agenda in the media.
DES is, after all, a prime example of the type of encryption one
gets when the government, rather than the brightest minds in the
private sector, are in charge of determining National Crypto
Policy and mandating the use of "approved" techniques.
I would suggest we obtain the test data for this exercise as soon
as possible, and widely disseminate it on the Net.  There is no
need to wait until we have distributed cracking software ready to
go before doing this, and having the actual data to play with
while munging the code together may lead to some new insights as
to efficient ways to attack the problem.

I think an effort to crack DES differs somewhat from factoring
RSA moduli or breaking 40 bit SSL in that tempting test data is
not everywhere for the taking. It may therefore be somewhat more
difficult for the typical reader to abstract a "what this means
for my data" scenario from the results of such an effort, and we
should expect at least a small amount of FUD from the American
Banking Association, which will recoil in horror at any
suggestion that what they are currently doing is not secure.
If we were preparing to attack something with a very visible
common application, like Unix Crypt(3), I would agree with you
that everyone would understand and see what was happening, just
as people were easily able to understand the notion of capturing
data during an SSL handshake, and pounding on it with large
numbers of CPU cycles.

Netscape's attempts at damage control were sorely limited by the
fact that the data used for the crack was captured during the
normal operation of their software.  Had Hal done some sort of
known plaintext attack on 40 bit RC4 outside the context of a
specific widely-used application, it is possible that a lot of
time would have been wasted countering the inevitable "this
doesn't apply to us" arguments from various software vendors,
with the general public understanding none of the terminology
used in the debate.  This would definitely have softened the
media impact of the accomplishment.

Correct.  But breaking a real-life example of single DES would be
a nice rejoinder to those who continue to insist, in the face of
strong grumbling by the cryptographic community, that single DES
is a cipher with many more years of useful life left in it.
If this speeds the adoption of second generation ciphers by major
players in the national infrastructure, then it will have been a
useful exercise.

The Sampling Theorem states that equally spaced instantaneous
samples must be taken at a rate GREATER THAN twice the highest
frequency present in the analog signal being sampled.  If this is
done, the samples contain all the information in the signal, and
faithful reconstruction is possible.
Exactly twice the highest frequency won't do, and it should be
obvious that sampling a sine wave at twice its frequency yields
samples of constant magnitude and alternating sign which convey
nothing about its phase and little useful about its amplitude
either.  (Drawing a little picture might be helpful here.)
Although anything over twice the highest frequency will work in a
theoretical sense, a small fudge factor does wonders for digital
signal processing, if only to reduce to a reasonable value the
width of the window into the sample stream needed for various
signal manipulations.

You want a continuous Fourier transform, not a discrete one, to
determine the frequency spectrum of the waveform being sampled.
The FFT is simply an algorithm for computing the DFT without
redundant computation.  In general, any Lebesgue integrable
complex function will have a Fourier transform, even one with a
finite number of discontinuities. The reverse transform will
faithfully reproduce the function, modulo the usual caveats about
function spaces and sets of measure zero.
There is no meaningful difference between speaking of the highest
frequency in a signal, and the highest frequency present in its
Fourier transform.

The Fourier transforms of step functions, square wave functions,
delta functions, and other oddities are perfectly well defined.
Again, the FFT is not relevant here.  A step function does not
have a upper cutoff in the frequency domain, so you can never
reproduce it perfectly from its samples, although the faster you
sample, the sharper the edges of the reconstruction will become.

TRS stands for "Technical Report Series." These are put out
periodically by the computer science departments of major
universities.  TRS-80 is a monograph titled - "The Sternlight
Effect: The Application of Nonlinear Matched Filters to the
Reduction of Additive Gaussian Noise in Usenet Articles."
DES stands for "Diethylstilbestrol", a synthetic estrogen given
to women at high risk for miscarriage in the 1950's.  Its use was
discontinued when the daughters of those who took it were
discovered to have a high incidence of vaginal and cervical
adenocarcinomas.  Male offspring suffered no life-threatening
health problems from prenatal DES exposure, but were often
afflicted with TWS. (Teeny Weeny Syndrome)
And finally, GAK is the name for the green slime frequently seen
to cover people on Nickelodeon, the childrens' cable channel.  It
is prepared from a variety of non-toxic ingredients in the
Nickelodeon kitchens, and supposedly is safe to ingest, should
one feel motivated to do so.

Me too.
This is an interesting problem, vaguely reminescent of the pie
judging contests commonly used as examples of non-parametric
statistics.  Given two pies, (or two women), a judge can
subjectively order them by tastiness, (or beauty), but there is
no concept of an continuous metric in which the ratings of
particular items are embedded.
This makes it somewhat difficult (at least for me) to determine
the function being maximized in this problem.  Do we mean a
strategy which gives the highest probability of choosing the most
beautiful woman over all possible orderings? If not, then we need
some way of saying whether we value N dates with the woman having
rank I over M dates with the woman having rank J, which requires
information the problem does not give us.  The first case is
ambiguous, since there are numerous strategies which differ only
in the probability of selecting items having other than the
highest rank, and the second implies the existence of some sort
of metric.
Indeed, what a person would regard as an strategy maximizing the
chances of choosing the "best" item overall depends very much
upon the choice of such a metric.  If we have 20 women whose
attractiveness is evenly spaced, one might proceed quite
differently than if the top 18 were attractive and almost
indistinguishable, and the other two had a contagious and fatal
If we make the leap of assigning the integers 1 to 20 to the
individuals, and seek a strategy which maximizes the mean
attractiveness over all possible orderings, then the problem can
be solved by backtracking from the last choice made.  This
results in a variable threshold at each stage in which we select
the current candidate if its rank in the items seen so far
exceeds the threshold, and proceed if this is not the case.
If we want a single partition point at which we choose the first
item better than any item before the partition point, then 1/e
seems believable, although I haven't personally worked out the

Ahem.  I think the sticking point here lies in the translation of
the phase "lowest gas price" into the appropriate function to be
Suppose we have 20 gas stations with prices p[1] through p[20]
which we have an equal chance of encountering in any of the 20!
possible orders while driving through town.  We have a
deterministic strategy for picking a station to buy gas at which
tells us whether or not to buy at the current station as a
function only of the rankings of the prices of gas at stations so
far encountered, including the current one.
This strategy maps every one of the 20! permutations of the gas
stations into one of the 20 prices, namely the price at which we
purchase gas by applying the specified strategy when stations are
encountered in the given order.
Finding the "best" strategy implies that we have some function
whose domain is the set of such strategies, and whose output is a
real number, such that the "best strategy" is one for which this
number is minimized.  Calling this function the "lowest gas
price" is somewhat misleading, since there are a variety of
different notions of "average" we may use to condense the 20! gas
prices a given strategy generates into a single number.
If we were concerned about our wallets, we would probably want
the strategy such that the arithmetic mean of gas prices was
minimized over all orderings of stations, but this is a
parametric notion, and requires that we know specific numeric
values of prices, and not simply whether one price is bigger than
Non-parametrically speaking, the only obvious way of ordering
strategies is lexographically, where a strategy which yields more
occurrences of the lowest ranked price is better than one which
yields less, and if two strategies are equal in their yields of
the N lowest ranked prices, we then compare them on the price
ranked N+1.
This is a function only of the relative rankings, but may not
necessarily choose the strategy which on average results in the
expenditure of the least amount of money.
So while the solution may be elegant, I would argue that the
problem, as given, is far from "well-defined", unless some
explicit metric which admits arithmetic means is introduced.

Stated this way, I suppose strategy A is better than strategy B if after
an arbitrarily large number of trials, N(A>B) > N(B>A).
It is still unclear that such a notion translates smoothly into notions
like "lowest gas price", where buying once at a station that is half
the price beats buying a dozen times at a station that is only one cent less.  It does translate perfectly well into the original problem of picking
subjectively beautiful women, however, which is also non-parametric in
a similar way.  It would be nice to see a short proof that for the
optimal solution, the threshold is the max of the first 1/e elements, and is not a function of how many steps have been taken.      Mike Duvos         $    PGP 2.6 Public Key available     $

Happened to browse the VISA Web site last evening to read about
the new microprocessor-based VISA Cash Cards that are being
accepted in lieu of small change at the Olympics in Atlanta.
While there, I noticed a new product that VISA is about to
introduce.  Called "VISA Travel Money", it is a pre-paid card
with a user-selected PIN which one can simply purchase at a
participating financial institution, just like Travelers Checks.
One can then use it at any of the 250,000 ATMs in 89 countries
until the amount one paid for it has been extracted, after which,
one presumedly tosses it.
Since the card is pre-paid, and does not involve the extension of
credit, I would think that a "nym" would have no difficulty in
purchasing one.  Seems like a convenient way to keep moderate
amounts of cash in a form which cannot be easily stolen, nor
perused by the Feds.
I wonder if an SSN is required at the time of purchase?
In any case,  and a few clicks will get you
all the available information.

I think it will be a popular product.  Sort of the credit card
equivalent of the disposable phone card.  Since the transactions all involve the extraction of money, there
is really no record of your purchases.  The linking together of a number of cash wishdrawals is not that big a deal, although they
could be used to track your movements if you did them in more than
one specific location.
There is also the problem of being photographed every time you use
an ATM, if you do not wish your identity known. Still, for people who are not on the FBI's most wanted list, who
plan to completely exhaust the card in a single location, and who
dislike signing a huge bunch of Traveler's Checks at one time to buy something, it sounds like something that might be handy to have.      Mike Duvos         $    PGP 2.6 Public Key available     $

The SEC, in cooperation with the courts, has been gradually
shifting the definitions of "insider" and "inside information" to
more all-encompassing ones.
It used to be that an insider was an officer of the company, or
someone with a fiduciary relationship to the firm, such as a
auditor or investment banker with which the firm did business.
Inside information was also similarly limited to a narrow
collection of material subject to regulatory restrictions on its
Nowdays "inside information" has been expanded to include
anything that the general public is not privy to, and "insiders"
can be almost anyone as well.
Indeed, the current definitions can subject to criminal sanctions
low level employees trading their company's stock on the basis of
rumors, or newspaper columnists trading in anticipation of
reaction to their published speculations.  It's not even safe to
trade on what formerly would have been known as "hot tips" any
more, unless the average person in the street had a mechanism to
access the information.
The legal theory behind all this is that anyone, no matter who
they are, trading on any publicly unavailable information, no
matter what it is, might be perceived as profiting at the expense
of the zillions of ordinary investors, whose continued playing of
the Stock Lottery^H^H^H^H^H^H^H Market the govermment and big
business definitely want to encourage.  Not to mention the huge
public support for the prosecution of anyone who the public
thinks has "gotten away with something" that Joe Six-Pack didn't
have the opportunity to do, and made a few bucks in the process.
If this trend continues, I won't even be able to take an Intel
janitor to lunch, and trade the stock based on his impression
that Andy Grove looked particularly happy while having his office
cleaned, without risking an "insider trading violation" should
the stock go up.
A new and interesting manifestation of the "Surveilance State."

Indeed.  One should note that some states already have
legislation which contains the magic phrase "appears to be" in
the specification of legal ages.  The testimony of a willing
pediatrician is all that is necessary to convert some random
fuzzy GIF into a lengthy prison term.
Morphing technology is a new approach to creating what appear to
be sexual depictions of children, but there have also been
prosecutions based on more traditional technology, like sissors
and paste.
Personally, I don't think it should be possible to commit a
crime in the privacy of ones home using only sissors, Scotch
Tape, an old Playboy, and a JC Penny Catalog.
Those familiar with "The Varieties of Religious Experience" will
recall something called "The Pious Imagination", which results in
every vaguely anthropomorphic smudge being seen as the face of
Christ.  I suspect the Child Sex Hysterics are afflicted with a
similar trait, which similarly transforms image ambiguity into
pre-teen orgies.

It should be noted that said Scientologist posts consist of
thousands of distinct little snippets from the Scientologist
Handbook and other similar tracts, posted as separate articles
from multiple accounts simultaneously.  This is clearly an
attempt to flood everything else off servers while staying clear
of the current definitions of Spam and Velveeta.
While Usenet tends to frown on content-based cancels, I find it
difficult to understand why the cancellation of thousands of
gratuitous posts duplicated amongst a large number of accounts
should be considered "content-based." Does participation in
a.r.s. ever legitimately require this level of posting?  It
shouldn't be too difficult to find non-content-based criteria for

@_subject: What backs up digital money? 
>> Question. If e-cash were backed by gold would that make it
 >> more reliable than say the dollar?
Not necessarily.  Historically, gold emerged as the primary
currency metal because it could be processed using simple
technology, didn't wear out, and the world supply from mining it
increased at approximately 2% per year, which was a good match to
the growth rate of most economies.
The current price of gold could hardly be supported by legitimate
industrial uses of the metal, and banks in Europe have tons of
the stuff in their vaults freed up from the mass departure of the
world's currencies from the gold standard a number of years ago.
Basically, one can create monetary value for any commodity whose
supply can be controlled, usually by the folks wishing to lend it
value, by simply making a stable market in it, and having the
reputation and power to control that market in perpetuity.
The best example of this is probably the diamond market.  Here we
have a rare but intrinsically worthless material, the gem quality
diamond, which has no useful industrial applications at all,
since non-gem quality diamonds and substitutes, both synthetic
and natural, are in abundance.
Gem quality diamonds are extremely valuable, because their supply
is carefully controlled, and because of clever marketing designed
to convince every male human in North America and most of Europe
that shelling out two months salary for one is the unique and
true symbol of everlasting love.
The diamond industry has even made plans for the holographic
fingerprinting of every diamond they release, should synthetic
gem-quality diamonds ever hit the market, so that they may
continue their control of the supply of their "currency", even in
the face of a flood of absolutely identical "unsanctioned" gems.
I recall a very clever Science Fiction story I read a number of
years ago in which aliens completely destroyed human civilization
by manufacturing all the world's goods and services, and
accepting payment only in cowpies, which were subject to an
arbitrary and complicated grading system similar to that used by
modern gemologists.  One day, the aliens simply left, and human
civilization, consisting mostly by then of PhD Cowflopologists
with expertise only in interpreting swirls on lumps of shit,
promptly folded.
Before I digress to far from your original question, let me state
the point I am trying to make here.  If a entity, or group of
entities, with reputation and power to make a market, decide to
demoninate a currency using a rare commodity, it makes little
difference whether the rare commodity is near-perfect crystals of
carbon found only on land that they own, a vault filled with gold
bars, exponentiated random numbers modulo the product of two
large but closely guarded primes, or statistically unlikely
swirls in wads of digested plant material dropping from the butt
of a cow.
In all these cases, the important thing is not the commodity, but
the entities guaranteeing the market, and the perception of their
reputation and ability to support said currency in perpetuity.
Absolute control over the supply of the commodity in question
doesn't hurt either.
Indeed, US government backed e-cash would be a far more trusted
and reliable currency than gold backed currency printed by
DigiCash BV.
One good inflation-resistant indicator of whether gold is a good
value is the ratio between gold and silver prices.  Both of these
metals are mined with similar difficulty, and have similar uses
for backing currency and as coinage metals.  Historically, there
have been times when gold and silver prices were approximately
I have no doubt that if the unwashed masses were sold the notion
that gold was the single reliable inflation-proof form of wealth
they could own, and the holdings of international bankers were
sold into the hands of millions of individual citizens, a
controlled devaluation would follow, together with much chortling
and uncorking of champagne, as gold and silver prices became
nearly equal again.
As long as people who count have vaults full of the stuff, and
wish to carry it on their books as an expensive asset, it will of
course continue to have its current inflated value, and nothing
will be done to depress the market.  In that sense gold is a
reliable asset, as long as most of the little people refrain from
jumping on the bandwagon.

Actual currency can circulate forever in the economy without
eventual conversion into some other kind of money.  The
requirements of current digital cash systems for centralized
clearing to eliminate double spending and to mint new coins tends
to preclude the kinds of perpetual peer-to-peer transactions we
think of when we conceptualize "currency."
Real electronic currency could be invented, but would have to
live its life within a population of tamper-proof smart cards
communicating with each other through secure protocols.  Whether
anyone will bother to implement such a system remains to be seen.
Until then, the "check" model of digital money is, as Tim points
out, the correct one.

"The reputation of the entities" is the only important
consideration regardless of what the cash is denominated in. In
most cases, the valued commodities, if they exist, are simply
pretty window-dressing for some unseen but powerful syndicate.

> The generalized halting problem comes to mind...
While it can be demonstrated that no algorithm exists to
determine whether an arbitrary Turing machine will halt, good
programs generally belong to a class somewhat less expansive than
the totality of possible Turing machines.  By imposing perfectly
reasonable constraints on program structure, it is trivial to
guarantee program termination with almost no loss in the
functionality of the typical programming language.
Indeed, any computer program which executes only forward
branches, and in which the iteration counts of all loops are
known at the time they are entered, is guaranteed to terminate.
Many people would even consider such things to be good
programming practice.
In general, the types of computer program characteristics which
make determination of halting impossible are precisely the
characteristics one does not want in trusted code, because they
make understanding the code and debugging the code intractable.

Again, a statement which applies to Turing machines, but not to

Again, there are no known security flaws in the abstract Java
machine.  Once all bugs and oversights in existing Java
interpreters are corrected, all Java programs will be rendered
incapable of causing damage to the platforms they are run on,
unless explicitly permitted to do so by an authorized person.

ObCrypto: Scrambling TV signals sometimes makes use of
encryption, so perhaps a brief discussion of how this is done
could be tolerated.
If you are talking about recovering signals from completely
encrypted digital MPEG-2 streams, such as those used by the DBS
folks, you are probably out of luck.  The relevant processing in
the decoder exists on a small card which has so far resisted
attempts at reverse engineering.
As far as analog signals are concerned, the "scrambling" of the
video only involves the clipping of the horizontal sync pulses.
This causes the picture to tear and the color burst to be missed.
So you get a funny torn picture with odd colors in place of the
original.  Sometimes, the set will momentarily lock on to
something in the picture in place of the missing sync and you
will get a reasonable picture for a few moments.  Kids often
watch porn channels for hours waiting for such an effect to
The usual way of transmitting the missing sync information is to
place an appropriately tuned 15,750 hz subcarrier on the sound
channel.  If you pick this up, and use it to add pulses back onto
the video, you will again get a signal your set will correctly
There are a variety of techniques for scrambling audio.  The most
expensive is to DES encrypt the sound and place it in the
horizontal blanking interval.  The regular sound channel can then
be used for advertising.  This requires a bit of processing at
both ends, and is generally used for satellite to ground
transmission of cable signals.  The other common method is to
modulate the sound on a subcarrier, usually the one transmitted
in phase with the missing sync.
In most cable systems using addressable decoders, nothing is done
to the sound at all, and the box simply mutes the set if its
address is not in the list of authorized users for that channel.
Persons viewing a PPV without a cable box will get a scrambled
picture, but perfectly normal sound.  This is commonly referred
to by people who listen to PPV events without paying as watching
in "scramblevision."
A hostile attack on such a system can be mounted in a number of
ways.  One can simply mung the set top box to restore sync on all
channels unconditionally, either by replacing a single chip with
a black market substitute, or by doing some surgery on the
electronics.  Once can also construct a number of simple circuits
which will yank the subcarrier off the sound channel, and use it
to trigger a pulse generator which gets added to the video.  You
can even stick one of these in your TV set to render it truly
"cable ready."
Of course, once television transmission goes completely digital,
and strong encryption is used on both audio and video, the
opportunity for such simple attacks will vanish.

This is indeed good news.  I haven't followed the satellite wars
for a while, and although I was aware that the earlier European
system had been broken, I didn't know that the one used by the

This is interesting, since the technology to do unbreakable

Digital systems eliminate the main drawback of analog ones for
using cryptography, namely that there is no way to strongly
encrypt the video and ship it out using the same modulation
technique which originally encoded it.
Once you have both audio and video streams in digital form,
having ones encryption "hacked" is more a function of
cluelessness on the part of those engineering the encryption and
authentication mechanism than some latent vulnerability on the
part of the technology.
I'm really surprised that DSS got hacked, given that the hacking
of the European digital system was well known while DSS was being
constructed.  Sounds like a very slow learning curve somewhere in
the engineering process.

In a well engineered smart card system for authorizing individual
viewers of a digital audio/video stream, each card contains a
unique serial number and a random cryptographic key stored during
the manufacturing process in a manner which cannot be obtained
even by destructive reverse engineering of a particular card.
The originating system then uses this information to embed
messages in the transmitted data stream permitting individual
cards to decrypt and recover the random and frequently changing
session key with which the channel bitstream has been strongly
If such a system has been properly implemented, all the
specifications for it should be able to be published without
compromising it.  Emulators for the software used in the cards

Perhaps in the private sector, where snake oil abounds.  I

BTW - what is the legal status of hacking DSS?  It's not like
cable, where you are tapping into a municipal service illegally.
You own the dish, the decoder, and the photons with which the

Certainly anyone authorized to view the program can "leak" that
program to other users.  Indeed, with the European system, people
have set up transmitters which simply run off a decoder that
subscribes to every program.  Not exactly subtle, but in
jurisdictions where such activity carries no significant legal
sanctions, an efficient approach to the problem.
Much like the case of sending an encrypted PGP message to
multiple recipients.  One or more of the legitimate recipients
can tell others what the message says.  Not a negative reflection
on the strength of PGP, and certainly not something I spend a lot
of time worrying about.
In the system I described, a person might make a lower bandwidth
attempt to defeat the system by leaking either the periodically
changing random session key used to encrypt the video stream, or
the unique cryptographic key belonging to a particular smart card
authorized to view the program.  We have postulated that the
latter is not recoverable even by destructive reverse engineering
of a specific card, and were such information to be compromised
upstream where the programming originates, it would only be
necessary to reissue new cards to the affected subscribers and
cancel the old ones.
Leakage of the periodically changing random session key directly
would require significant surgery to a working smart card,
although it might be recovered by tapping appropriate points in
the circuitry.  However, anyone using such information for
unauthorized reception would require a constant connection to a
provider to continually update the key, which would be awkward,
and not likely to be done by a large population of people in a
way which was inconspicuous to LEAs.
I can't imagine that a significant market for pirate equipment
could be built around any of the attacks described above. Indeed,
a significant market exists only for ersatz smartcards which a
person can purchase for a fixed price, stick in their decoder,
and then forget about.  The system I described would certainly
preclude such a device from being built.
I spent a bit of time on the Web last night reading up on the
various attacks which were mounted against DSS and the earlier
European VideoCrypt system.  The implementors put what they
though were a lot of cute features into the cards, including the
ability to reprogram them from upstream when software updates
were needed.  Unfortunately, rather than relying totally upon
strong cryptography within a tamperproof module, they also
employed easily forged checksums to validate commands sent to
the cards, and "security through obscurity" as to what those
commands were.
The ultimate result was that the cards were being updated with
new software almost constantly, and the hackers were issuing
updates to the pirate versions within hours each time this was
done.  Given the way the system had been implemented, there was
really no way prevent this from happening.

If what you are trying to do is make sure no subscriber will
ever disclose, by any means, the contents of a program to a
non-subscriber, then of course you are right.  There is no
technology which can prevent this.
If, on the other hand, you wish to prevent clever engineers
from looking system with instrumentation, and then
trotting off and stamping out millions of their own smart
cards, which interoperate with the legitimate ones and
decode all programming transmitted, this is something that
can certainly be done by using strong cryptography correctly.
It is this latter goal which the VideoCrypt system, and now
apparently the DSS one as well, failed to accomplish.

A few more hopefully short comments...

There is no physical difference between cards.  The key
information is stored in EEPROM, and the links which permit the
EEPROM to be written are burned after programming is complete.
The EEPROM data is then only accessible to intimately associated
circuitry in its vicinity.
Presumedly the state of the EEPROM cannot be deduced by any
external examination of the card, and any attempt to
incrementally abrade the card down to the relevent circuit
elements should completely obliterate the minute charge
differences which represent the data.
At least, that's the theory.  The Europeans trust this technology
well enough to let it represent real money, so presumedly they do
not consider hacking a possibility.
Perhaps our resident VLSI and Alpha Particle expert, Timothy C.
May, could give us a guess as to whether Perry's "Nasty
Mechanism" is more or less likely than Maxwell's "Daemon."

Assuming Perry is right and a smart card could have its innards
transplanted into a hostile environment, the scheme you describe
would offer no real protection.  The compromised card would
simply do the communication with the Key Distribution Center and
give all the information to the pirates.  A low-bandwidth link,
such as a web page, would be more than sufficient to communicate
the required bits to everyone else on the planet.
The security of a smart card based system has to lie in the "data
cannot be recovered even by destructive reverse engineering"
aspect of it.  If this is not a given, then cards can be exactly
cloned, and one clone can tell others what they need to know to
prevent the duplication from becoming known to the other side of
any transaction.

We aren't talking about IC masks here.  We are talking about
electrostatic charges which would instantly leak away if the
insulation around them were in the least bit compromised.
Such data wouldn't even survive the preparation for scanning
microscopy, much less the actual inspection process.

If you put something fragile inside a container which cannot be
breached without exposing the fragile thing to a destructive
environment, then the fragile thing is very unlikely to be
retrieved intact.  The specific parameters here will of course
vary with what technology is available, but I think live EEPROM
cells deep inside a multi-layer VLSI device are probably safe
from scrutiny for the lifetime of your average smart card.  Live
registers too, for that matter.

The original scenario outlined how strong cryptography could be
used to authorize pay per view in a manner which was not
vulnerable to obvious hacking.  The successful use of strong
cryptography depends upon keeping certain key information secret,
and it was postulated as part of the scenario that this could be
done within a smart card.
An endless metaphysical quibble over whether God can create a
smart card he can't peek into does not serve to further
illuminate the cryptographic issues under discussion.

High praise, considering the source.
Now I am certainly not going to waste any more time trying to
explain solid state physics, how EEPROMs are put together, that
the tamper-resistant packaging of Capstone is designed to thwart
the reverse engineering of an algorithm contained on the masks
used to make the chips, or impuning the supposed powers of
"national laboratories."
However, I will observe that whenever technology is put forth for
criticism on this list, there are always a few people who insist
upon maintaining that anything can be easily defeated.
"All you have to do is " they exclaim, where  may
be replaced by "Quantum Factoring", "SQUIDs", "Scanning Tunneling
Microscopy", "NP=P", "The EPR Effect", "Nanomachines", or some
other exotic notion which would be lucky if it had even achieved
a laboratory demonstration under carefully controlled conditions
much less a practical application to the problem in question.
Common to all such claims is a gross underappreciation of the
engineering difficulties involved, in this case those related to
reading logic states buried in a densely integrated digital
device without destroying them.  Something that isn't easy to do
even if the device has been designed specifically for the purpose
of permitting such observation in a laboratory environment.
Such distractions, unfortunately, are why good physics rarely
gets discussed in sci.physics, and why discussions on this list
about nuclear bomb design, tampering, and hacking frequently take
off in the crackpot direction.
The bad eventually drives out the good, and few of the competent
posters are going to continue to comment on a thread which has
degenerated into the "You don't know anything.  Mr. Squid can

The scruffy/neat competition has been around for a long time in
the hard sciences as well.  Good examples are the competing
notions used by mathematicians and physicists for doing
differential geometry, calculus of variations, and field theory,
and the physicists who think physicists can do chemistry better
than chemists can.
Ultimately, there tends to be a merger of notations and
approaches. The big Misner, Wheeler, Thorne book on Gravitation,
for instance, presented everything both from the view of the
physicists, who like to write everything as algebraic equations
in terms of components of geometric objects with respect to a
basis, and the view of mathematicians, who like abstract maps
between abstract geometric objects, and terms like tangent
spaces, exterior products, and germs.
Usually the scruffies get great results using formal manipulation
that horifies the neats, and then the neats come in and do the
rigorous proofs that demonstrate that everything the scruffies
did was valid.
This was certainly the case in quantum mechanics as well, where
questionable formal manipulation got the right answers for many
years before a rigorous theory of unbounded linear
transformations on Hilbert spaces was developed.  Indeed,
physicists happily computed commutators and anti-commutators of
such operators blithely unaware of their domains and ranges long
before the equivalent definitions in terms of one parameter Lie
groups or projection valued measures were known.
While Java is currently a scruffy invention and has yet to
recieve the official blessing of the neats, there are a number of
things that speak in its favor.
First, object-oriented runtime structures such as those used by
Java have pretty much been researched to death in various other
venues, such as APL, APL2, Smalltalk, and the MIT Lisp Machine
project.  It is not likely that we will discover some previously
unknown mode of corruption in such systems, and defensively
coding interpreters for these kinds of languages and verifying
them to prove that they contain no errors which could result in
the violation of container boundaries is a well-developed art.
This doesn't mean that such systems are free of bugs, of course,
but it does mean that they are free of the type of really cute
bugs that allow users to trick the machine into executing
arbitrary machine instructions, or into making disingenuous
requests to the kernel.
Second, there is quite a bit of experience on the part of OS
designers in meeting various levels of MIL Specs for security,
and with the standard techniques, such as audit trails,
authentication, and ACLs, which are commonly employed to
implement the features required.
So although the neats have not yet given Java their blessing, it
is extremely unlikely we won't manage to create an environment
which can safely run untrusted Java code, and filter the
program's requests for system services in a way which will block
and log any attempts to do nasty things, both for the Applet
model, and for more general applications.
A prior poster suggested that in the absence of formal proofs of
correctness, flaws permitting the exploitation of covert channels
and other such things in a language such as Java were "a
certainty." I think the situation is more complicated than this
suggests, and while I probably wouldn't want an artificial heart
with Java software today, I think a lot of the worries will
resolve themselves as time passes, and the things we are
all discussing are implemented.

This is silly on several levels.  First, given that a finite
amount of resources are available to combat the sexual
exploitation of children, law enforcement should concentrate
their resources on the production of such material, and not on
the incidental evidence of its production long after the fact,
and in a context completely unrelated to any economic link back
to the original producers.
Someone who has an encrypted file on their hard drive from some
motheaten child porn magazine published 20 years ago is no more
guilty of the exploitation of the models portrayed than someone
who downloads the Simpson crime scene photos from
alt.binaries.pictures.tasteless is guilty of killing Nicole and
Ron.  If anything, such a picture is little more than historical
documentation of a bygone era and an expensive distraction for
police officers who might better spend their time. Indeed, if encryption inhibits the ability of the government to
create exceptions, based solely on irrational public hysteria, to
the First Ammendment right of citizens to communicate amongst
themselves on any subject, including via the use of visual
material, then encryption is serving a valuable purpose.
Now before anyone accuses me of advocating a thriving market in
child porn, let me say that I have no objection at all to laws
which set a minimum age for working as a performer in the sex
industry, and to enthusiastic prosecution of individuals who
violate those laws.
I just think the police should concentrate their resources on
real children experiencing real abuse, and leave their prurient
interest in the contents of libraries and other peoples computers
behind when they go to work.

It's actually encrypted three times with two keys comprising
112 bits of keyspace, using a decrypt on one key sandwiched
between two encrypts using the other.  This prevents a "man

When the first IBM PC came out, I ran QNX on it, a Unix clone from a
company called "Quantum."  It did full pre-emptive multitasking, had a nice C compiler, and shared code between tasks, all on a little 8088
with two floppies and no hard drive and 768k of ram. We even had "talk", and I could chat with people who dialed the modem
I had hooked to my serial port, and they could log in and do work on my system at the same time I did.  When MS-DOS first appeared, the quantum people kindly provided DOS emulation for QNX and I could simply type "DOS", and read DOS disks and
run DOS programs.  Ultimately, however, as new and "improved" versions of DOS appeared, with
obtuse features, and almost every app using them, I finally bowed to the march of progress and installed DOS 3.1 on my system.
A giant leap backwards into the dark ages. QNX is still around, by the way, and I believe its primary market
is now embedded real-time systems, where its highly responsive and
optimized kernel can be exploited. Whenever I think of how nice QNX was, I recall Bill Gates' comment
about the true power in the software industry being not technical
excellence, but being big and strong enough to set industry-wide

While "basic skills" come in useful, is the much touted high

The diplomas are handed out to pretty much anyone who sits
through 13 years of public schooling without complaining too
loudly, shooting a teacher, or blowing up the school.  Reading
and the ability to do simple math are not much of a requirement
The NEA would love to have a system where ones public school
experience follows one everywhere like an unofficial government

opinions of teachers on ones good citizen-unit-ness, denying
employment to everyone who doesn't toe the line.
I think the privacy implications of a vicious education-based
class system, rather than a web of providers of educational
services, held accountable by demanding clients, are fairly
apparent to everyone.
Well, of course one gets a certain amount of economic power by

Oh come now.  There are plenty of toothless rural people who can
read and write, and even have families and jobs.  They don't have
much of anything else.
You have heard of the "working poor", haven't you?
Permit me to make a giant leap here and suggest that whether one
is poor pretty much depends upon the market which competes for
ones services.
The major problem (or feature, if you are an employer) of the
jobs market is that one is essentially competing with a large
number of other people to see who will take the least amount of
money to work themselves into an early grave.  No matter what the
value added by ones work to the product being produced, such a
market is essentially a bottomless pit, especially if others
doing the competing are hungry and desperate.
It's kind of like Harlan Ellison's description of the ultimate
television game show.  You bring out a small boy and a dog, and
the contestants vie amongst each other to see who will take the
least amount of money to shoot the dog in front of the boy.
The key to escaping poverty would therefore seem to be to compete
in a market based on the value of what one produces (i.e.
entrepreneurship, small business, consulting), or to compete in
a market where the others competing with one are all fat, happy,
and fairly affluent (i.e. very specialized technical skills).
The success of the Asian community in stressing small business
and higher education would seem to be an excellent example of
this model in action.
I'm not convinced one can escape poverty by simply being a high
school educated hard-working person who is eager to please.
Perhaps this was once the case, but I think the economy is a bit
too tightly stretched these days for such truisms to have any

Yet fully anonymous mailing has always been supported by the Post
Office.  You may put anything, or nothing, as the return address
on an item to be mailed, and drop it in the dead of night into
one of millions of conveniently provided bins located almost
All for the quite reasonable price of thirty-two cents.
It is interesting that the above model doesn't seem to survive
parallel translation across the manifold to the TCP/IP arena.
One reason for this is that there is no Postal Equivalent of
Usenet.  If anonymously mailed items magically appeared as
articles in tomorrow's paper, for instance, one might expect
significant heat to be generated, as well as calls for the
elimination of anonymous mailboxes, and the association of a
valid ID with each item mailed.
The other reason is that the network of anonymous Postal
mailboxes is so vast, and specific individuals are not associated
with particular mailboxes.  There is no way for someone like Hal
to have rhetorical responsibility, for instance, if the Unabomber
plops his latest exploding package into a particular box.

Of course, Unix people can send anonymous mail without the use of
remailers.  Spoof an Ident or an IP, stuff it in some kind
person's sendmail port, and "Voila!", the mail is on its way.
Perhaps we need a remailer that automates this process.  Current
remailers all identify the sender quite clearly with a message
such as the following...
"This message was mailed by an automatic posting service.  The
sender takes no responsibility for its contents, but if you want
to sue someone for an unspeakable amount of money, my name is
It is clear that this model for remailers fails miserably if any
significant amount of legal heat is applied.
Contrast this with a DC-Net of boxes which can covertly inject
packets into the Net, in some untracable manner.  Now we have no
identifiable "Hal" to be harrassed, and no one for the Clams to

Mobile Agents, which could carry an encrypted message and stuff
it into the Net from some random location.
We are certainly at the point where the notion of a "remailer" as
an identifiable source of traffic run by a specific individual is
about to bite the dust.

@_subject: Floating Point and Financial Software 
There seem to be a few mini-flames on the list over whether
floating point data representations are appropriate for financial
In a nutshell, the answer is "YES", and the use of floating point
arithmetic is common in such applications.
One argument heard against the use of floating point is that it
is inherently "imprecise." In reality, floating point
representations and the results of floating point operations are
perfectly well defined, and the points on the real number line
which are exactly representable by double-precision floating
point values are usually a superset of those representable by the
default integer on most machines.
Storing monetary values as double-precision floats having integer
values in cents is even common in COBOL programs, where the
"COMP-3" data type allows the use of fast floating point in lieu
of the default and slow manipulation of packed decimal and
decimal data.
It is even common in certain CPUs, like CDC Mainframes and
SPARCS, which are primarily floating point engines, to omit
integer divide and sometimes even multiply, and to provide a
subroutine which employs floating point calculations to emulate
these operations. This is completely transparent to the user of
the machine, and there is no problem in using floating point to
do integer operations.
In fact, when running financial applications on large engineering
mainframes, which generally lack a business instruction set,
floating point is not only commonly employed, it is the obvious
way to get the maximum performance out of the machine.

You can temporarily modify router tables, spoof IPs and idents,
and leave few traces behind once the data has been transferred,
particularly if the origin is some obscure foreign location.

Correct.  But I was mentioning DC-Nets only in the context of a
mechanism for permitting the dispersed parts of such a system to
communicate with each other, without identification of a
particular node as being responsible for a particular action.

The idea here was to have a large number of nodes, each capable
of injecting data into the Net in a manner which cannot be easily
traced back to an individual.  These nodes would talk to each
other using a mechanism which obscured both eavesdropping and
traffic analysis of their communications, a DC-Net being one
possible way of doing this.

You could get the same effect with an instant anonymous account
that could be purchased with Ecash.  You would buy it on the
spot, send your mail, and forget about it.  For all practical
purposes, it would serve the same function as a remailer, and
steps could be taken to obscure the identity of whoever had
telnetted to it.
Another possible approach is the "remailing packets" one.  You
could set up a packet remailer which could be used as a universal
proxy server in some untouchable foreign location.  If we had a
"packet remailer in a box", these things could pop up all over
the place, live a short time, and be nuked.  Since the
communication would be real-time, concerns over reliability and
delivery would not exist in the same way they do for the current
system of remailers.

I don't think most people are going to pay to remail.  Or, to put

Fellow C'Punks,
In my quest to reduce NP-Completeness to NP-Not-So-Hard-Ness, I
have just finished coding and debugging a very complicated
algorithm which manages to solve circuit satisfiability problems
of up to 1000 nodes in a few minutes and about half a meg of
memory. It works directly from the connectivity information and
the time required is not a function of the number of input bits.
Circuit satisfiability problems, and other well known problems
like Max P-Sat, are amongst the more useful canonically
NP-Complete problems, since other problems map very nicely into
The algorithm is currently in APL, and I am in the process of
recoding it in C, after which I plan to test it on reduced round
DES, full 16 round DES, and some RSA problems of various sizes.
I already have C code to map RSA and n-round DES problems into an
appropriate circuit satisfiability problem and generate
appropriate input for the algorithm, so finishing up the C
version is the only remaining step before these tests can begin.
The current APL reference inplementation can still handle
problems up to about 1000 nodes, which should include a lot of
stuff for which exhaustive search would be intractable, even on
Nothing I have so far fed the reference implementation has bombed
it, and I would like to make sure it is perfect before the finely
tuned C version is complete.
So if anyone has a "hard" problem they are dying to solve, which
maps into a circuit satisfiability problem that isn't over 1000
nodes, Email it to me and I will see if I can divine the answer.
I will post any interesting results to the list, of course.

Actually, I would expect any AI algorithm which has some notion

circuits allows you to add the correct additional variables to a
problem which would be gigantic if you did the output directly in

I will wait to see if this thing munches through DES of various
rounds before claiming any "research results."

Well - the typical DES S-Box requires between 130-155 2-input
logical operations to express its 4 bit output in terms of its 6
bit input if you basically construct it in the obvious no-brainer
way without attempting any clever optimization.
Throw in a few XORs, and you can wire 2 round DES in about 2,500
one and two input logical operations, and the full 16 round DES
takes about 25,000.  I'm sure this can be improved upon greatly,
if someone wanted to tweek the wiring diagram.
What I've done to convert DES to a circuit satisfiability problem
is to make a logical network with (56+64+64) input bits and 1
output bit. The input consists of (key,plaintext,ciphertext).  I
pass both the plaintext and ciphertext through the IP, and do
half the rounds on each with the appropriate subkeys.  Then I XOR
opposite 32 bit sections between them, OR it all together, and
complement the output.
This yields something which lights up if the key maps the
provided plaintext into the provided ciphertext and outputs zero
otherwise.  When it is instantated with a particular
plaintext/ciphertext pair, this diagram can be munched by the
previously mentioned algorithm to yield a possibly non-empty set
of keys.
RSA is a little bit more messy.  Given a modulus between 2^k < N
< 2^(k-1), you can construct a circuit which when instantated
with the modulus bits will light up if and only if the larger
of the two distinct primes is input.  The way I do this requires
only two multiplicative operations, one being a modular
reciprocal of an odd number modulo 2^k, and the other being a
multiplication.  Both of these are wired as N^2 algorithms,
using successive approximation, although near-linear algorithms
probably exist.
As a data point, a circuit which lights up when RSA-140 is input
can be done in about a million NANDs.  Someone has offered me
some time on a 64 meg ultraSparc to try some RSA problems, but I
am going to debug the C version on DES first.

The problem here is that they are "assumed" to do this as a
matter of inerrant scripture, in spite of quite a bit of evidence
indicating that this is not the case.
It doesn't exactly send those under 18 a positive message about
their bodies when it is suggested that capturing the slightest
overt representation of their sexuality is a crime worthy of
flaying and burning at the stake.
I agree that persons should probably be protected from working as
models or service providers in the commercial sex industry until
they reach the age of majority.  But the things that are being
proposed these days look much more like an ideological purge of
material relating to youthful sexuality than a serious attempt to
protect children.  The reasons given as justification are almost
always overly vague.

The definition of "child porn" today is so excessively broad that
it tramples on the notion of protected free speech and need not
involve a "pervert."
Since the alleged sexual exploitation of children is the one
political issue no CongressRodent can afford to be seen as soft
on, it is hardly surprising that this single issue will likely be
the wedge used to successfully attack protected free speech.

But of course we aren't really talking about "speaking in favor

This is a very vague and spurious connection, much like the
suggestion that sympathetic views towards Communism in the '50s
would lead to the overthrow of our government.  Purging all
depictions of adolescent sexuality from our society under threat
of imprisonment is hardly a prudent public safety measure.

Our constitution would be far better if it had a strong privacy
provision, rather than the current First Ammendment. There will
always be reasonable exceptions to the notion of absolute freedom
of speech, and in every era, people will believe that their own
pet issues, (Communism, Child Sex, Abortion Information), should
be amongst the special exceptions made.
In a country like Sweden, for instance, a constitutional
ammendment would be required to ban private possession of any
printed material in a citizen's own home.  Here, all it takes is
some grumbling by the child sex hysterics, and you can go to
prison for sitting at your kitchen table with sissors and a jar
of paste, and making a collage from selected pieces of the JC
Penney Catalog and the latest issue of Playboy.
Many so-called child porn laws are easily the silliest examples
of the "Tyranny of the Majority" and "thoughtcrime" ever to rear
their heads in modern times.

This is an interesting point.  There are a plethora of foreign
films, and some domestic ones, which contain frontal nudity by
persons under 18, as well as suggestions and sometimes even
fairly explicit depictions of acts such as masturbation or sex
between adolescents or (horrors) between an adolescent and an
None of these films has a rating worse than an (R) from the
censors at the MPAA, and a lot of them have glowing reviews
singing their praises by the likes of Siskel and Ebert, Judith
Crist, and John Hartl.
Paradoxically, the US Government has never prosecuted a
mainstream film under child pornography laws, evidently feeling
that this was a can of worms they didn't dare open, or at the
very least, not wanting to risk losing the case and establishing
a precedent
So while people are getting prosecuted for a grainy computer
picture they downloaded from the Internet, which some pediatric
"expert" testifies "appears to depict a minor", such glowing
cinematic moments such as the hardon comparison scene in Bernardo
Bertolucci's "1900", or Jill Clayburgh masturbating her teenage
son to orgasm in "Luna", are freely available to anyone who wants
them, and even get shown on Premium Cable to boot.  Not to
mention the child nudity in films ranging from the ancient
"Macbeth" to the adolescent boy loves boy epic "You Are Not
Showtime must have run David Hamilton's "Tendres Cousines" at
least a zillion times when it was first released, as well as
prominently featuring it in their weekly softcore erotica slot,
even though it featured the rather explicit seduction of a 14
year old boy by an older girl, complete with nudity, flushed
cheeks, and panting orgasms.
If the Hatch bill in one form or another passes, will the
government still continue to ignore the art film market in its
quest to stamp out depictions of child sex?  How will the
artistic community react when the feds start throwing people in
jail, and burning the master prints of critically aclaimed films,
under the excuse that the mere existence of such material
"sexualizes" children and "encourages child abuse?"

At this point, I would love the ability to filter news and mail according to some criteria related to the sender's probable
reputation.  Back in the early days of C&S, spam was an intellectual issue.  Now it is a good chunk of the entire
bandwidth of major components of the Net.
I am now getting more junk email than email from people I care to correspond with.  It seems one can't even read the
scholarly newsgroups anymore without "Come Watch Us Lick

It's really getting to the point where the time-honored

Just being able to filter out posts from Net addresses that

done at the reading end, and people could still post anything

Nothing to do with the government.  If people choose to
voluntarily obtain a key with which to voluntarily sign their
posts, and I set my newsreader to present only articles which
correspond to keys having certain criteria, all is well and good.
Anyone can still post anything they like, including unsigned
articles, and the filter is at the reading end, which is where it
should be.
A given key could mean "I am Mike Duvos", "I am Tim May", or "I
am Dorothy Denning." Or it could mean something more obscure,
like "I showed my driver's license to get this key", or "10
leading Cypherpunks think I'm a Nym worth listening to", or even
"I donate regularly to the 700 Club."

Bullfeathers.  Encouraging people to sign posts, and permitting
newsreaders to select based on signature characteristics is about
as big a threat to anonymity as a procmail file which filters out
everything having an anon remailer disclaimer attached to it.

Baud denotes the number of state changes made by the modem on the
line per second.  The possible states generally form some sort of
regular pattern in frequency/phase space, with each state being
maintained long enough to reliably determine it on the other end.
Before the advent of V32 and V32.bis modems, the underlying
symbol rate was substantially lower than it is now.  Then it was
determined that it was possible to overdrive the line cards on
digital switches to equalize them over a wider range of
frequencies, without smoking them down.  The newer modems take
advantage of this kludge.
Since the underlying digital data stream is eight thousand 8-bit
u-law samples per second, there are genuine theoretical limits in
terms of symbols per second which cannot be crossed.

Don't confuse "baud" in terms of characters per second through
your modem with the low level symbol rate of the modem's analog
output into the phone line.  The "baud" you see is a function not
only of the low level symbol rate, but of framing, the V.42
compression/error correction process, and other factors.

The price of ISDN is a function of phone company marketing, not
the cost of providing the service.  Domestic US service is almost
entirely digital now, and moving the subscriber line interface to
the consumer end, so the digital aspects of the network may be
fully exploited, is not a conceptually expensive process.

I think we should have nipped Gilmore in the bud when he censored
Vulis, and immediately looked for a new site to host a
Cypherpunks list which was not subject to sudden and arbitrary
censorship by the site owner.  John, of course, would have been
perfectly free to continue to host "Gilmore's Moderated
Cypherpunks List", and we would have perfectly free not to post
there any more.
Instead, being comfortable and lazy, we tolerated Gilmore's
pathetic attempts to exterminate the pesky Vulis, and given that
Vulis was more than a match for Gilmore mentally, the pissing
contest soon escalated as the frantic Gilmore took more and more
extreme measures to find "the final solution" to the good
Doctor's posts.
Again, predictable behavior by everyone involved.

Ten days notice to relocate a high volume mailing list is

And we've all come to the conclusion that you are a flaming prat

You know, I've always been a big non-fan of John Gilmore.  I know
you're the co-founder of the EFF and the alt Usenet hierarchy,
and a well-known and respected mouthpiece on the topics of
communications policy, censorship, privacy, and free speech in
certain circles.
But almost every single piece of private communication I've seen

self-centered nasty little excuse for a man, unwilling to listen
to any opinion that doesn't agree with your own, and quite
willing to heap any amount of ridicule and derision on

Speak for yourself, John.  You obviously have no idea what or who
"Cypherpunks" are, and you are the last person on the face of the
earth who should be making proclamations about what "a large
fraction of the list" thinks.

There is a fundamental difference between choosing not to provide
a forum for someone to speak in, and in providing a forum for a
long period of time and then deciding one day to kick the podium
out from under the speaker in mid-sentence, or to edit the
speakers comments before distributing them.

Another sudden change in the topic of the list by fiat with no

attaching the name "Cypherpunks" to this travesty of yours.  Why
not change the name to GilmorePunks, CocksuckerPunks, ToadyPunks,

The Supremes can bypass the First Ammendment anytime they choose by simply

with the Knox "clothed child porn" decision, and the recent Hatch nonsense
making any suggestion of underage sexual activity illegal, regardless of
whether underaged models were involved in its production. I expect textual material will be outlawed in a few years as well, as a
"loophole" in the current laws, since real children no longer have to be
associated with such material in order for it to be deemed harmful. Once that happens, a whole bunch of other things will probably be outlawed

I'm certainly jumping up and down and cheering.  I said a while
back that the life expectancy of DES would be about two weeks if
anyone forked over serious cash.
I'm also pleased to see they will be offering prizes for trying
to break Ron Rivest's new RC5 cipher, which scrambles using data
dependent rotates as its only non-linear operation.  This is very
speedy, and if it turns out to be robust, will be a nice fast

Ick.  Why overly complexify things?  A known plaintext attack
would be far more straightforward.  After all, the goal is to
recover the key, not the message.  Having to find a key which
decrypts to something having all high bits clear will discourage
people who might want to take a crack at this independent of the
canned program you are going to distribute.

This is VERY IMPORTANT.  Unlike factoring problems, where the
data supplied by people can be checked in a small fraction of the
CPU time used to generate it, searching a keyspace is very
vulnerable to sabotage or stupidity on the part of the people
doing the searching.  It is well worth the extra factor of 2-3 to
guarantee that the exercise will eventually terminate.
Sounds good, but I would prefer matching plaintext and ciphertext
with the goal of recovering the key.  This is really the
situation that would exist for someone tapping financial data on
a line, and knowing the plaintext of a transaction he
deliberately generated for testing purposes.

Only countably many real numbers, or members of any uncountable
set, are denumerable. It is the property of being uncountable,
rather than of being real or complex, which is important here.
In general, only countably many members of any uncountable set
can be precisely specified within any formal system, given names
comprised of strings of symbols, or other similar things.

It is often convenient, such as when drawing contour maps, to
consider the complex numbers to be in 1-1 correspondence with the
points of the plane.  However, I wouldn't necessarily consider

We can't physically draw a line segment to arbitrary high
precision. We can conceive of the notion of line segments being
in 1-1 correspondence with the reals, but we can specify at most
countably many "finitely denumerable" line segments if we wish to
discuss their lengths individually.

Yes, the Reals can be constructed from the Rationals.  No, the

Fortunately, construction in mathematics is not simply limited to
the taking of subsets.  The Rationals can be constructed from the

Cauchy sequences are useful for adding limit points to a set of
things because their convergence criteria is very simple, and it
is conceptually easy to take all Cauchy sequences whose elements
come from a given set.
If we then consider equivalence classes of those Cauchy sequences
which converge to the same limit, and consider an element of the
original set to correspond to the class containing the sequence
all of whose members are that element, we can consider the
classes to form a "completion" of the original set by addition of
all its limit points.
Similarly, the Reals are the completion of the Rationals.

Finite ordered sets have maximum elements.  Bounded infinite
ordered sets have Least Upper Bounds, which may be a limit point
as opposed to being an actual member of the set.
Dedekind Cuts are a simple abstraction, often used to construct
the Reals from the Rationals in undergraduate calculus courses.
Conceptually, one makes a single "cut" in the set of Rationals,
dividing it into two parts, all of the members of one part being
greater than all of the members of the other.  The number of ways
of doing this correspond to the Reals.

We can construct the Reals from the Rationals without having to
speak of each specific Real while doing so.  A formal system,
having only a countable number of strings of symbols from its
alphabet, can speak of "The Real Numbers" even though it cannot
speak of "The Real Number X" for every single X in the Reals.

In standard analysis, the limit of a sequence A[n] is a value x
such that given any positive epsilon, no matter how small, we can
find a point in the sequence such that all its members after that
point are within epsilon of x.
Such a limit, if it exists, is unique and exactly defined.
"Little o" and "big o" are concepts from complexity theory and I
am not precisely sure why you feel they need to be mentioned.

In the general case, the limit point will not be a member of the
sequence which approximates it.  Although every member of the
sequence is a finite distance away from the limit, the limit
itself is, as I previously mentioned, exactly known without any

An "infinity" is simply the property of being able to be put in

Mathematical objects are sets with structure.  We generally
consider two mathematical objects equivalent if there exists a
1-1 correspondence between the respective sets which is structure
preserving. What the actual members of the set are, and how they
were constructed, is usually unimportant.  For all practical
purposes we may refer to any mathematical object isomorphic to

of X" for every single Real X.

a formal system without running out of space.

Useful formal systems employ finite strings from some alphabet.
The set of all possible such strings is countable.  The set of
all sequences from the same alphabet is uncountable, but not
particularly useful for theorem-proving, at least in a finite
amount of time.

In Axiomatic Set Theory, it is necessary to postulate (either
implicitly or explicitly) the existance of one infinite set. This
is an act of faith.  Whether any infinities really exist is a

If one constructs the Ordinals, which are isomorphism classes of

We can construct the Reals from the Rationals without having to
speak of each specific Real while doing so.  A formal system,
having only a countable number of strings of symbols from its
alphabet, can speak of "The Real Numbers" even though it cannot
speak of "The Real Number X" for every single X in the Reals.

In standard analysis, the limit of a sequence A[n] is a value x
such that given any positive epsilon, no matter how small, we can
find a point in the sequence such that all its members after that
point are within epsilon of x.
Such a limit, if it exists, is unique and exactly defined.
"Little o" and "big o" are concepts from complexity theory and I
am not precisely sure why you feel they need to be mentioned.

In the general case, the limit point will not be a member of the
sequence which approximates it.  Although every member of the
sequence is a finite distance away from the limit, the limit
itself is, as I previously mentioned, exactly known without any

An "infinity" is simply the property of being able to be put in

Mathematical objects are sets with structure.  We generally
consider two mathematical objects equivalent if there exists a
1-1 correspondence between the respective sets which is structure
preserving. What the actual members of the set are, and how they
were constructed, is usually unimportant.  For all practical
purposes we may refer to any mathematical object isomorphic to
the Reals as "The Reals", without any confusion.

The problem here is that the terms "infinity" and "number" are
used to refer to many different things in mathematics.  We use
"infinity" as a term for transfinite Cardinals and Ordinals, but
also use it when describing convergence on the reals, to indicate
that a sequence increases without bound.  We use it in calculus
to describe the limits of integration over all real numbers, a
set which does not include any infinite numbers at all.
Similar we use the term "number" to refer to Cardinals, Ordinals,
Reals, Integers, Complex, Quaternians, or whatever, hoping that
what we mean by it will be clear from the context.
With respect to the Real numbers, infinity is not a number, but
simply a way of saying something increases without bound or that
we wish to include all the positive or negative reals when
performing some mathematical operation.
With regard to Ordinals and Cardinals, not only is infinity a
number, but there are an uncountable number of different
infinities, which cannot be placed in 1-1 correspondence with
each other.

@_subject: McVeigh 
One of the major flaws of the Criminal Justice System in this country is
that one can only appeal based on procedural issues.  No one, after a
trial has concluded, may ever challenge the trial verdict. They may only
argue that the proper ritual was not followed, and higher courts are very
reluctant to disagree with the actions of lower courts, preferring instead
to state that the errors committed would likely not have affected the
outcome. It gets even worse than that.  Many states, Texas amongst them, have a
time limit for the introduction of new evidence after a trial, even if it
completely exonerates the defendent, and are prefectly willing to execute
someone as long as they have been given "due process," even if it has been
clearly demonstrated that they are not guilty. Thus the Sheeple are led by their politicians to ridicule the numerous
often-frivilous appeals defendents engage in, irrespective of the fact
that frivilous appeals are the only ones allowed under law, the defendant
having no right at all to suggest that twelve Sheeple being performed for
by the local prosecutor produced something other than a Biblically inerant
verdict. McVeigh therefore has no chance at all at getting another hearing on the
facts of the case.  He might claim that the confidential attorney/client
work product stolen from the defense team computer on the eve of the trial
and touted in papers nationwide as a "confession"  poisoned the jury pool. But even that has little luck at succeeding. The only difference between Tim McVeigh and Richard Jewell is that the
government stopped the hatchet job on Jewell in midstream.      Mike Duvos         $    PGP 2.6 Public Key available     $

No government can afford to behave in a way that outrages large numbers of
citizen-units, and provokes action on the part of the less mentally stable
ones.  Janet Reno sealed the fate of the federal building on the day that
she took action which resulted in numerous children being incinerated,
just so she could win a dicksizing contest with a religious extremist. I worry a lot more about the behavior of the United States, the nation
that never apologizes, the arms merchant to the world, five percent of the
population of the world that thinks it has the Manifest Destiny to dictate
to the other ninety five percent, than I worry about whether such behavior
inspired little Timmy McVeigh and others of his ilk to set off a truck
bomb. I think the odds are about 50/50 between McVeigh being the bomber, and
McVeigh being the first anti-government extremist sap the Feds tripped
over after their precious building blew up.  It's not as if we have the
ability to make that distinction given coerced testimony from friends,
planned leaks, and invented testimony from the FBI crime lab, all of which
could have been easily manufactured for an arbitrary suspect. Maybe McVeigh blew up the building, and maybe he didn't.  Like the Kennedy
assassination, the official version of the facts is now all that exists. Along with many Vietnamese children, Granadian children, Panamanian
children, and Quadaffi's baby.  At least in Oklahoma city, we didn't have
marines bulldozing the bodies of dead civilians into trenches to make
everything neat and tidy before the press arrived. Yes, Oklahoma city was unfortunate.  It was not remarkable or unexpected. If the government deliberately kills Tim Mcveigh, it will not bring back a

Yes, indeed.  Some outraged citizen in Tennessee bitched that he
carried nudist pictures of minors on the BBS.  Those weren't
illegal, but an enterprising federal agent then joined the BBS in
an attempt to screw the Thomases.  He sent them unsolicited child
porn, used it as an excuse to raid their residence and seize all
their equipment, and finally got a conviction over some
bestiality pictures which were technically illegal in Tennessee,
although such material could be found in local porn shops only a
few blocks from the prosecutor's offices.

After the feds finished giving the Thomases an anal reaming in
Tennessee, they recalled that Utah was one of the few states
conservative enough (along with Ohio, I believe) to include all
nude depictions of minors in its child pornography statutes. They
then arranged to have the Thomases dragged from Tennessee to Utah
to be reamed again, this time by the Mormons.
 > One of his defense arguments was double jeopardy, and the

Right.  Tennessee busted him for bestiality pics.  Utah busted
him for pictures of happy children playing outdoors au natural.
Of course naked children were really the hidden agenda behind the
Tennessee prosecution too, if the truth be known.

The hardcore child porn business is reprehensible.  The nude
children playing tennis business less so, depending upon ones
religious and political affiliation, of course.

The appeals courts are going to play hardball with the Thomases
until they repent and shut down their BBS, which no longer does
business with the states of Utah, North Carolina, and Tennessee.
"Continuing to engage in the enterprise" has been cited in a
former appeals court ruling as a reason why the long prison
sentences given the Thomases were supposedly justified.
I believe it was George Wallace who commented that the United
States was in reality run by "Thugs and Federal Judges."

This is a kind of a Prisoner's Dilemma type game-theoretic
problem. Each side desires to maximize their mathematical
expectation, which is the sum of their expected return for each
possible behavior of their opponent times the probability that
behavior will occur.  One may assume that one has an intelligent
opponent who can also analyze the game.
The robbers can either promise to let their victim live after the
PIN has been extracted, or not.  Once torture has produced a PIN,
and it has been tested in the ATM, they can either kill their
victim or not kill him.
The victim can either give the PIN before major damage is done,
or he can hold out until he either dies or rescue arrives.
For the robbers, the money is a small return, and getting charged
with murder should the police arrive right after the victim has
been terminated is a big loss.  Letting the victim live to
identify the robbers is a medium sized loss, but killing the
victim and getting away with it is no loss at all. For the
victim, the loss of some money is a small loss, and the loss of
ones life is a big loss.
Now the only return for the robbers is the money, so anything
that doesn't result in the money is worse than not committing the
crime in the first place.  There is no incentive for the robbers

the robbers will not lie about this.  A rational victim will
postphone death as long as possible, so it is always in the best

This crime takes a very short amount of time to commit, so rescue
is unlikely.  Torture which results in either the PIN or mortal
injury can be carried out in under a minute.  If the PIN is not
disclosed, death will therefore result.  If the pin is disclosed,
you have a chance of living equal to the chance the robbers will
not kill you.
So the optimum strategy if both players have analyzed the game is
for the robbers to promise not to kill you, the victim to always
immediately give up the PIN, and then for the robbers to either
kill or not kill the victim, based on the relative penalty times
the chance of getting caught for each alternative.
There is nothing the victim can do to improve his chances, except
to hope he lives in a community where the penalty for robbery is
small compared to the penalty for murder, and that a
disproportionate amount of law enforcement resources are devoted
to solving murders, versus solving robberies.

workplace health and safety standards within the commercial porn industry,
including setting reasonable age limits for employment therein, the

: Right. I read a book on that. I think it was called "The Millgram

: and could have been assumed to be unconscious or even dead. An excellent
: demonstration of the power of authority. And the gullibility of the

conclusion after persuading quite ordinary people to administer what
seemed to be fatal electric shocks to a subject, pressured only by the
orders of an authority figure saying "The experiment must continue"  and
other such phrases, was that should the United States wish to set up a
system of Nazi style death camps, personnel to staff them could be taken
from the population of any average midwestern town. He also did another interesting experiment called "prisoners and guards"
in which he selected people at random and dressed them up in the
appropriate uniforms.  The guards happily abused the prisoners, falling
into the appropriate roles almost automatically. Of course, such psychological experiments are banned today, because they
don't make it through the ethics committees.  Nonetheless they demonstrate
that there are few differences between "us" and "them," and that most
ordinary people will rise to the occasion when given a new pair of
jackboots.      Mike Duvos         $    PGP 2.6 Public Key available     $

With all this talk of germ warfare and carbon fiber attacks, I

Not so long ago, some university scientists invented a catalyst
which, even in microscopic amounts, would prevent formation of
the contiguous oxide film which protects metals from rapidly
reacting with the oxygen in the air.
They called a press conference to demonstrate their new
invention, which was carried on CNN, and after placing one drop
of their magic solution on a metal plate, held it in front of the
cameras as white power erupted from various points on its surface
and it promptly crumbled to pieces.
Now I found this quite an interesting demonstration, and much to
my non-surprise, this invention was never mentioned in the media
A few years later, in an article for Omni Magazine on
scientifically advanced technologies for knocking out critical
infrastructure, G. Gordon Liddy made mention of a "Classified
Liquid Metal Embrittlement Technology," in which a liquid
catalyst could be concealed in a object like a magic marker, and
applied in small amounts to structurally significant components
of aircraft, which would later undergo catastrophic structural
failure in fight.
This sounded to me a whole lot like the stuff the scientists had
shown on CNN in the press conference.
Anyone remember this?  Would any chemists in the audience care to
hazard a guess as to the chemical composition of said catalyst
and the mechanism of its interaction with the target to be
