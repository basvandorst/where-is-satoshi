@_subject: Space Shuttle uses 2-version programming 
I wonder if Jeremy read the Wikipedia article he linked to...  currently it
  "The Backup Flight System (BFS) is separately developed software running
  on the fifth computer, used only if the entire four-computer primary
  system fails. The BFS was created because although the four primary
  computers are hardware redundant, they all run the same software, so a
  generic software problem could crash all of them."
