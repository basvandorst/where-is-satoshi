lance is talking about encrypted archives, pgp'd messages, ssh and silc.
short version is that his honeypots install a kernelmod to log all the
IO buffers after decryption or before encryption and then fire them out
over the wire. there is another kernel mod to prevent the raw socket /
bpf / lpf / tap / ??? from seeing frames with a certain mac address.
i saw him at cansecwest last week - good talk as usual. the talk he gave
should be posted to  shortly...

it's scary just how much mission-critical stuff runs on windows. i'll
confess right now to being a unix zealot, so the thought of anything
mission critical (beyond hotmail and freecell) on windows is scary.
i know of some fairly large installations running control systems for power
generation on windows. these same sites then give the vendors access to the
system via vpn across the internet. sure there are firewalls, but i don't
have faith in the long-term maintenance of the vendor sites.
the power lines are certainly low-hanging fruit...

the register has a fun page about cheap UAV / drone widgets...
i've been to more than one lan party / geeky caffeine klatsch
where we pondered what happens when people start making flocks
of drones carrying ... unpleasant things. wondering how big or
small of an EMP you could carry around in a drone. wondering
if you could maybe set a mostly-styrofoam drone to orbit for a
few days or weeks soaking up the sun, charging its batteries
before showing up for work somewhere. a few thousand feet up,
an albatross-sized craft would scarcely be noticeable.
