Well, I have never been assigned a penet id -- not now and not earlier.  (I've only been on this account for almost a year, and my memory isn't *that* bad.)  This probably rules out the "who cypherpunks" attack.  But then I haven't posted much to this group -- perhaps, whoever he/she is, is more interested in frequent/recent posters?

It's slighly more than a whim too, I think.  I think I recall something about encouraging use of *traceable* electronic funds transfer for more transactions is something like an official statement from one of the not too distant G7 meetings.
Another point not directly related to Perry's post:  This list seems to "know" that people *want* anonymous digital cash.  Does anybody actually know *how* *much* people want this?  Is Joe Common willing to pay something extra for this anonymity functionality?  Does anybody have facts about this, or is it just assumptions??  "Since we think it's good, everybnody must want it!"

@_subject: Anonymous questionnaires 
Interesting problem.  The suggestion (by whom?) to use two envelopes is useable as long as there is a trusted party involved.  This is very similar to the way such surveys are performed in Norway:  Each questinare has a random number on top and a trusted party is able to link numbers to participants' names and check who has answered and so on.  Researchers only see numbers and not names.  The problem is that the trusted party is often very close to the researchers using the survey...
Here is a suggestion for an electronic solution based on anonymous electronic coins:
You fill in your form and submit it electronically to the survey organizer.  The organizer acknowledges your form by giving you a blind signature much in the same way as a withdrawal in a Chaumian electronic cash system.  Later you unblind the signature and send it to the organizer together with name and adress to be registered as a participant.  The blind signature prevents linking of your name to the returned form but still proves that you have returned a form.
Not directly provided by this simple solution, but the suggestion made by Stephen D. Williams to link you and your partner by writing down the same random number on the returned forms can be used.  There are other ways to link anonymous transfers too, but I won't come into that now...
OK.  They get your name together with the unblinded "coin" to prove your Same as above.
OK due to properties in the anonymous cash schemes.
The problem with this seemingly simple approach is that it requires an anonymous online connection between you and the survey organizer.  Confidential and/or anonymous channels does not seem to be "in" among network providers today... :-(

False!  If digital coins represent some kind of value the bank will "earn" something by not accepting a coin presented for deposit.  The bank will not have to provide the value or the service the depositor is entitled to.  This was also pointed out by someone else posting to this list.
I haven't studied the maths and protocols of the original post to closely, but just to show that it is possible to *prove* double spending I present a deposit protocol.  I don't know if this protocol fits in the implementation discussed here.
If I remember correctly, some of Chaum's (?) digital coin systems proved double spending by using a protocol resembling the one below:
   1)  Depositor presents a part of the coin to the bank and asks "Is        this coin already deposited?"
   2)  The bank answers "yes" and proves this by revealing some        information about the coin which it should now know unless the        coin has already been deposited.  The "no" answer together with        the information presented by the depositor is signed by the bank        and is a *commitment* by the bank to accept the coin when the        "real" deposit takes place.
   3)  The depositor sends the rest of the coin to the bank if the answer        was a "no".
This is taken from memory -- I could probably produce some references if someone is interested.
By the way -- I don't think you should use the "digicash" word to describe this implementation.  David Chaum's company carries that name!

[Much stuff deleted...]
Yes, there is an interest.  Please provide whatever information you have on "European Clipperism".  I haven't seen any discussion or reports on any such initiatives in Norwegian media.  I suppose that there isn't a "critical mass" of interested people in small countries like Norway for these issues.  There has been one attempt by one Norwegian party (Venstre) to raise questions on personal privacy issues, but without any success.  (This party has been out of parlament for a while and has some trouble getting heard.)
Work has been done by official Norwegian agencies to develop a National Encryption Standard (NSK).  The result of this work is a classified algorithm and a chip which implements it, much like the Clipper initiative.  There was also a suggestion about something like a key escrow system, but this seems to have been dropped.  NSK has had some press coverage, most notably in a left-wing paper (Klassekampen) and Computerworld In a speech held by one of the organizers of the NSK project some two years ago, it was indicated that NSK was developed partly to assure Norwegian control of the algorithm and independence of foreign algorithms.
Could other Europeans provide information on similar activities in other By the way, I agree with those who oppose disinformation on Clipper and related issues.  Such strategies will likely hit you like a boomerang.  The clarification by TCM on what he meant by "disinformation" was welcome.  I, and it seems others who opposed the disinformation strategy, understand this world differently than TCM.

Do you fight noise by being noisy yourself??  To me you won't be much
better than Detweiler himself by adopting this aproach.  You have read
postmaster's statement on the Detweiler case, and in my opinion his
views must be respected.
It is a little strange to observe a group fighting for privacy and anonymity in the electronic community start whining about harassments from anonymous users.  We all know that cryptography, anonymity etc are two-edged swords, and we all have argued that the "good" properties more than offset the "bad" ones.  Now we have tasted one of the "bad" properties of anonymity on the net -- perhaps a healthy lesson.
The Detweiler problem seems to be solving itself.  I haven't seen any posts neither to this list or to any of "his" usenet groups lately and postmaster indicates that it is Detweiler's intention to stop the flooding of the net.  It is only us other users, now including myself, who keep the memory of Detweiler alive.  Let's give it a break.

Hrm...  As far as I recall they showed how to do _message_recovery_ (not encryption) with the discrete log signature functions.  Message recovery and encryption are two quite different things for assymetric schemes such as the discrete log ones (as opposed to RSA).  Correct me if I'm wrong...
Yea, cool stuff, especially if the fax doesen't shrink the transmitted picture :-)  This is also great for demonstrating crypto to newbies by showing that noise+noise=picture.

@_subject: low-overhead encrypted telnet 
[Some text deleted]
Have you seen the proposals for an encryption option for TELNET?  There are at least two proposals.  The first is by David Borman dated April 1990 and the second by Lawrence Brown and Gilje Jaatun dated December 1991.  Borman's proposal focuses on the possibility of encryption of passwords only.  Unfortunately I don't have a pointer to an electronic copy of these proposals -- perhaps someone else on this list has?
I am currently working on a project which requires encrypted TELNET.  We will be encrypting *all* transmitted data to protect sensitive information -- not just passwords.  Does anybody know the current status of standardization of an encryption option for TELNET?

I agree with your observation.  The Telnet protocol is however independent of any underlying network protocol.  In our application the Telnet connection can be established over a lot of different types of networks.  Implementing secure IP will not give us much since it does not cover the other possibilities for a Telnet connection.  It is also a question of resources (read "time") -- we require a solution *now* (and preferable yesterday :-)
No flame, just an observation that what seems to be a better solution is not always suitable...

European telecommunication is (slowly) being deregulated and demonopolized.  For instance we now have two competing companies offering mobile telephony services in Norway -- not bad for a country of just 4 million people :-)
Perhaps the problem is that we don't have a "critical mass" of concerned people.  The EU is not as integrated as the US (and Norway is not even a member!) so these matters are usually left to individual (and small)

This was probably Eli Biham's talk during the rump session titled "Cryptanalysis of multiple modes of operation".  His conclusions were basically that you should use the "traditional" triple DES -- other variants had a nasty habit of being *very* vulnerable to diff cryptanalysis.

Before you get too enthusiastic remember that electronic cash is not legal tender which means that you will require some clearing system behind this scheme providing conversion between a legal tender and electronic cash before this is getting really useful.  Without such a system electronic cash is just prepaid "tokens" with the usability similar to the "tokens" on telephone cards.
For those that thinks this will be "the end of the gouvernment":  Who do you think will be in control of this clearing system?  Just asking ;-)
However I do think that this DigiCash stuff is a Good Thing -- certainly better than mailing credit card numbers over the net :-)

Yes, and if you had quoted my entire message you would get my point.  Since electronic cash is not legal tender -- just a way of transfering legal tender -- a clearing system which administrates the "real flow of money" must exist so that participants can exchange their "transfer tokens" to "real" cash.

This will be the last I have to say on this matter (hear... hear...), not because it's an uninteresting matter but it has been (heavily) debated before and it's approaching weekend time in Norway :-)
[Delete key used heavily...]
I agree!!  That's why they require a clearing system (which cash doesen't).  A cheque has no intrinsic value (which cash have -- well, since the gouvernment says so).  A cheque has value only because it can be cashed.
Here I think we are nearing the real issue.  We agree that all electronic cash schemes require clearing, yes?  The problem is that many schemes are specified without this system which means that it can't be used in real life situations.  Just see (almost) any paper on digital cash.  This was my intended point when commenting on the original postings.  The DigiCash scheme probably is *great* but it won't be *usefull* by everybody in an open system before a clearing organization exists.  Due to gouvernment regulations etc a clearing system is not trivially implemented.  Since it wasn't explicitly mentioned (as a cooperation with a bank, VISA etc) I assume that it's (for the time) non existant which again means that it will take some time before this cash scheme is useable by the public at

According to Christopher Andrew in "KGB: The Inside Story" the Russians started to reuse one time pads near the end of the war due to the sheer volume of secret information being sent.  This was discovered by Meredith Gardener of the ASA in 1948 and later exploited to crack these messages.
The operation goes under the names of Venona and Bride.  The latter is used in Peter Wright's book "The Spycatcher's Encyclopedia of Espionage".
