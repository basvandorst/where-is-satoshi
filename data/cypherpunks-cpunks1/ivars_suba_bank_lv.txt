Is it possible that Skype doesn't use RSA encryption? Or if they do, do
they do it without using any padding, and is that safe?
No ,Skype use RSA encryption:
"Each party contributes 128 random bits toward the 256-bit session key.
The contributions are exchanged as RSA cryptograms. The two
contributions are then combined in a cryptographically-sound way to form
the shared session key."

But what you have shown here has no encryption, hence no secrecy.
Surely RSA encryption must be used somewhere along the line. The report
doesn't say anything about the details of how that is done. In
particular, although it mentions RSA signature padding it says nothing
about RSA encryption padding.
