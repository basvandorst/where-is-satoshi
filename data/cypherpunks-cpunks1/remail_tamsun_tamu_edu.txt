@_subject: neural nets 
Speaking of neural nets and image recognition, my former employers
landed a contract with "various law enforcement agencies" although
the project manager I spoke to said primarily the FBI and CIA - to
develop neural network hardware and software to do face recognition,
to be used to identify criminals at the airports.
Indeed, I recall being photographed twice when I hired on - normal
lighting for my regular id, and low lighting.  At the time, I
wondered why but didn't think anything of it.  The project manager
said they were amassing a database of pictures to use as training
Pretty interesting...

@_subject: `Stalled' Progress 
Quicksand is fine if you use pontoons. We *are* a guerrilla operation,
aren't we? Let me pay homage to those who have endured the risk of offering
their student accounts for use as remailers, etc. We need more like you. I
could get some bootleg student accounts, but I think the annoyance factor
might outweigh the benefit of more resouces. And, as my anonymous posting
implies, I'm not entirely sure I want to be out of the closet as a
cypherpunk yet.
This is indeed our great vulnerable point. We should attempt to
decentralize it (at least have more backup). UNIX gurus- if I put PGP in my
home directory, how do I make it available netwide? Does my sysadmin
Another possibility - spring some real cash and get cycles and ftp support
on netcom or something like it. How much would it cost?
Is it cycles, space and access we need, money, or just someone to take charge?
Once we got digital cash working, things have a better chance to become
self-supporting and less at the mercy of university system administrators.
How difficult would it be to get some resources (cycles, disk space, code)
from Chaum's company Digicash? We could do an academic research project
studying the feasibility of trade over internet, funded primarily by
in-kind donations. Can we piggy-back on the netcash effort? Is this really a problem? I'm always pleasantly surprised when something
gets done, even if I'm working on it.
I don't know about anyone else, but the tangibility did it for me. I used
to be fatalistic about privacy etc. The tangible achievements of the
cypherpunks have given me hope that there *is* a soft underbelly on that
beast. Not that ideology isn't fun!

@_subject: ANON: remailer list 
tamsun and tamaix are two different machines which share, NFS-ed, user
directories; hence, any mail sent to tamsun or tamaix goes through the same bit
of remailing script.  They both work independantly, however, and I decided to
keep both in case one of the machines goes down for some reason.
Let me know via email to remail at tamsun.tamu.edu if you still can't get your
message through.  It should work though.

@_subject: Attacks on remailers 
Hal Finney writes a nice "To Do" list for the cypherpunks
remailers by enumerating and describing possible attacks.
Let's priortize these items.  First we should do those
items that are easy to implement, and those items needed
to prevent any remaining cheap 'n easy attacks.  We can
leave expensive attacks for future projects.
This should be made smoother.  The learning curve needed to
get to this stage : install PGP & get it working, learn
how to use remailers, install remailer nesting script, debug
all of the above, because something in there is bound to
break at this stage : quite a lot of work!  Just
improving things up to here with clearer documentation,
and better scripts and GUIs, would greatly increase the number
of remailer users and traffic.
The former is much to be preferred!  The first link in the
remailer chain, especially, needs to be trusted not to
maintain logs.  The trustworthy remailer operator goes to great lengths to minimize the temptation to look at messages.
Batching and random delays only work well if there is large
message traffic through the remailer.  What in specific
detail is needed to gain access to the mail stream to
make these attacks?  If no mail logs are kept, and the remailer
denies access to a spool file, by hiding it or putting
random garbage in it or denying access to its host computer,
an attack looks to me like it requires a sophisticated wiretap.
Avoiding expensive attacks is low priority at this First let's make the problem happen.  Then we can solve it!
Here's another item: faster links!  The delay between
when I post this and when it arrives on "cypherpunks" can
be half a day. What about that idea of using direct sockets instead of
SMTP between remailers?  That could kill two birds with one stone:
delivery speed and cheap attacks against the intermediate
links via logging or spool files.

@_subject: NSA & the Crypto-Zionist Myth of "Public Key"! 
Excuse me, but I'm getting tired of this silly paranoia.  NSA
is not Evil Incarnate Central, and we are not fighting a Valiant War We Are Fated to Lose.  The NSA are a  bunch of Americans who went
to school & college with the rest of us, and share our communities
with us.  Most of them joined NSA to fight totalitarian Communism, and most of them are sympathetic with values most Americans share when they bother to think about them, like freedom, privacy, etc.  Sure, NSA has
been caught up in the Cold War habits of secrecy, bureaucracy, and
an ingrained habit to control information.  It's also almost surely
caught up in the same kind of bureaucratic incompetence we see
in the rest of the U.S. Federal government (most of the DoD, the space programs, the BATF, the FBI, etc.)  Does a $40+ crypto-voice-chip with an obvious trap door look like Malicious Plot to Destroy All Strong
Crypto and Take Over The World, or does it look like an
a half-competent, half-hearted attempt to retain Cold War era capabilities they had gotten used to?
NSA is going through the same crisis of goals as the rest of
the Cold War establishment.  Their mission, if they have any left at
all, has changed radically, and they know it.  While it
may be "in the best interest of NSA" to maintain control over
strong crypto, that's only a superficial analysis at one level.
NSA employees are also Americans, community members, family
members, etc.  They don't typically go around murdering hackers
they don't like.  Nor would that accomplish anything for them --
RSA was published internationally long ago, and PGP is now
scattered at sites all over the world, with new versions being
hacked on in nearly a dozen countries.   The biggest problem I've encountered talking to various
people about implementing encryption is that they think
cypherpunks are a bunch of paranoid nuts, so only paranoids
would want to do things like use digital cash for their
semi-legal barter schemes.  Your expression of surprise that the NSA hasn't offed Phil Zimmerman just confirms their suspicions.
How can I convince them that cryptography is not just for paranoids?
The rest of us are concerned about things like protecting and
enhancing our privacy and freedom, and there's nothing silly
or paranoid about that.
But now that you mention it -- Shamir does operate out of Tel Aviv.  Obviously he built RSA with a hole in it, and NSA is the
main arm of the Crypto-Zionist conspiracy of Jewish Planetary Hegemony!  And he didn't publish "Differential Cryptanalysis of the DES" until
non-Zionist bankers got ahold of DES.  It's all clear now!
I think your head has to have some sort of a hole in it.  Perhaps the
NSA's work?

@_subject: anonymous mail 
PEM also reveals who signs messages, even when the message is encrypted.
In other words, if I send you a PGP encrypted message which I also signed,
the signature is hidden under the encryption. You do not know who sent you
the PGP message (assuming a cypherpunks remailer or equivalent was used)
until after you decrypt the first "packet" and gaze inside.
PEM, on the other hand, reveals in the clear who signed the message, outside
of the encrypted portion. Also note that to be PEM compliant, you *must*
always sign your messages. So much for anonymous encrypted messages...
There is something to be said for the PGP encapsulated approach...

@_subject: Encryption policies of Fidnet, etc. 
Forwarded from alt.cyberspace:
->> Joseph T Dickinson was mumbling something about Encryption <<-
 JTD> It is illegal to encrypt messages period.
 JTD> E-mail encryption is illegal
Depends on your network and where you live.
It is illegal to use PGP in the United States due to its use of a
copyrighted algoritm.  It is *NOT* illegal to use it anywhere else in the world.  Other encryption methods are legal.
In Fidonet (the largest *amatuer* mail network), it is against policy to
encrypt 'echomail' (Fido version of newsgroups), but perfectly acceptable to encrypt *direct* netmail (Fido email delivered directly to
the recieving system without regard to its location).  Routed netmail (email passed from system to system before eventually arriving at its destination) may be encrypted provided each sysop whose node the message
passes through agrees that the message may be encrypted, otherwise, it has to be sent en claire.
On RIME (Relaynet International Mail Exchange, the *2nd* largest amatuer
run network), email is regularly encrypted as part of the networking and
routing software in use by the network.  Sending routed, reciever-only mail is not only common, but *encouraged*, since it cuts down on the overhead of the other systems in the net.  You'd have to look at the network's topology to see why; it's basically a 'tree' formation in which nodes at the bottom feed their newsgroups up to the topstars and recieve them from the topstars. ... Get the facts first - you can distort them later!

@_subject: REMAILER HEADERS 
Some of you know the sender of the below message, please don't blow my
cover, I'm testing the remailers and people's knowledge of message id's
(if that would even be an accurate way of tracing the message).  Cypherpunks remailer addresses and headers from those sites appear below.
If you can trace the origin (sender) of this message please send me mail
personally rather than to the list.  I'm using my favorite remailer here
and I want to make sure it's working right.  I have sent mail to the below sites as a test for anonymous remailing
returns and to see what headers I get back. It has been maybe 4 days now
since I began this experiment, some of the sites below have still not
remailed my test message.
My main curiosity in this quest is to determine what each header will look
like when the mail is recieved.  I think this is important in determining
which remailer to use.  The below is the list of remailers with the "unique header to remailer" info
below each site number.  If you wish to discuss this matter further, please send a follow up
message to the cypher list with your address included and "Re: Unique
header".  I'm really not too concerned about remaining anonymous, I just
want to see if this scheme is really airtight! A typical mail header looks similar to the below:

@_subject: Shorter PGP keys 
I was thinking of trying to come up with a short form of my PGP key.
Very few people put their PGP keys into their .sig's any more because
they are so lengthy.
Here is my key, 1024 bits, as it would normally appear:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.0
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
This has a couple of signatures on it and is pretty long.  I stripped
the signatures, figuring that people can get them from a key server,
and that helped quite a bit.  Also, the "Version: 2.x" line is not
currently used, and if you eliminate it you don't need the blank line
after it.  Also, the last line is a checksum for the key and in today's
internet environment you don't have to worry about noise that much.
Stripping all these gives:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
This is pretty compact and wouldn't be bad in a .sig.  We've gone from
12 to 6 lines.  I wish there were a mode in which PGP would scan a file
looking not for "-----BEGIN PGP" but rather for lines which are exactly
64 lines long and contain just the RFC1113 (or whatever it's called now)
character set.  I realize it would get fooled by PEM but maybe the user
would only run it if he knew it was a PGP file.  Then you could reduce
the key to four lines.
If you were willing to use a 512 bit key, good enough for casual use,
you could get it down to 3 lines.  This is probably an appropriate
level of privacy for people on multi-user workstations (i.e. as much
privacy as they can expect).

FACT SHEET
What is TRW PhonePrintTM ?
TRW PhonePrintTM  is a system designed to block illegal access to cellular networks by cellular "counterfeiters" who use stolen telephone identification How Does It Work?
Each cellular telephone emits unique signal transmission characteristics - an electronic version of a human fingerprint - which cannot be duplicated.  These characteristics are matched with the mobile identification number (MIN) and the
electronic serial number (ENS) of the phone to develop a unique pattern for each legitimate customer, TRW PhonePrintTM  uses sophisticated signal analysis hardware and software to analyze and file the patterns belonging to legitimate customers.  When a caller attempts to access the network, the system compares incoming patterns to those on file.  If the patterns do not match the call is immediately terminated.
Who Benefits?
Cellular telephone fraud costs the industry up to $300 million annually.  TRW PhonePrintTM  benefits cellular operators and customers by:
When Will It Be Available?
TRW PhonePrintTM  is currently being tested by PacTel Cellular, Los Angeles. Testing is expected to be completed in early 1994, and the system will be made
available to cellular carriers nationwide.
The Company
TRW, headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, is strategically focused on providing
products and services with a high technology or engineering content.

WORLDWIDE ELECTRONIC COMMERCE:
      Law, Policy and Controls Conference
****************Program Details****************
Dear Colleague:
Our world is getting smaller.  Electronic Data
Interchange (EDI), Electronic Mail (E-Mail) and other
computer-based technologies (that collectively support
Electronic Commerce) are drawing individuals and
organizations closer together.  However, these exciting
developments also present significant challenges.
Corresponding audit, controls, legal, policy and security
issues pose potentially serious barriers to the rapid
adoption and extensive use of Electronic Commerce.
Worldwide Electronic Commerce will address the
implementation and control issues inherent in applying
Electronic Commerce to today's environment.  The
answers provided at this conference will address current
problems as well as provide a foundation for dealing
with these complex issues in the future.   We have been
fortunate to have secured an unusually qualified and
internationally recognized faculty to share their
experience, knowledge and theories on the wide range of
issues identified in this brochure.  We are equally
pleased to have obtained a distinguished group of
organizations who, in affiliation with this conference,
are lending their considerable support.
Please join us at this unique and ground breaking event
which will be held on January 16-18, 1994 in New York
City at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
Michael S. Baum, Esq., Conference Chair
M. Todd Ostrander, Conference Co-Chair
WORLDWIDE ELECTRONIC COMMERCE
CONFERENCE PUT ON IN AFFILIATION WITH:
SUNDAY, JANUARY 16TH - Registration 17:00 - 20:00
1. WILL LEGISLATION KEEP UP WITH ELECTRONIC TRADE?
Viewpoints of law reform experts on the development of
diverse topics of possible legislation affecting
electronic commerce will be presented. Current and proposed
legislation from around the globe will be presented and
considered for its practicality and likelihood of
impacting electronic commerce.
2. ANATOMY OF A MODEL EDI AUDIT PROGRAM
More and more organizations are designing and
implementing enterprise-wide EDI and electronic
commerce systems. Audit standards, guidelines and
practices are in the process of responding to the need for
EDP and MIS systems auditors to have a detailed
understanding of the requirements for auditing EDI
systems. This session will outline the EDI systems audit
requirements and provide an overview of the ASC X12
Model Audit Program currently under development.
Experienced auditors will walk you through the results of
their years of experimentation and implementation and
explain an effective and practical audit program that you
can implement.
3. WILL PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS INHIBIT ELECTRONIC How does personal data communicated among trading
partners and/or the government, particularly in open
systems environments, create barriers to business
transactions? Data protection is a frontier for electronic
commerce.  This session will distinguish privacy and
confidentiality and discuss methods to protect companies
from the risks associated with the improper disclosure of
telecommunicated personal data. It will also consider the
economic, privacy or national security requirements and
restrictions imposed by governments, and their impact
on electronic commerce. Various laws and directives,
including the EC's proposed directive concerning the
protection of individuals in relation to the processing of
personal data will be identified and considered in
conjunction with charting a viable approach for
4. CLEARING HOUSES AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE
Clearing houses provide administrative, legal and
technical infrastructure which support various computer-
based commercial trading services to bolster the
reliability and enforceability of electronic transaction
records, reduce legal uncertainty, and generally facili-
tate electronic trade. The scope of implemented clearing
house services depends upon available technology, legal
and security requirements, potential liability, the
availability of insurance, and, of course, business needs
and costs. Clearing house services also extend well
beyond "traditional" clearing house functions to provide
broad-based support as a trusted entity. This session will
detail how clearing houses affect electronic commerce
controls and security.
SESSION 2: 10:30 - 11:50
1. TRADING PARTNER AND BUSINESS AGREEMENTS IN
ELECTRONIC COMMERCE
This session will present case studies that illustrate how
trading partner agreements (agreements among parties to
electronic trade transactions) have been implemented by
industry and government to facilitate electronic trade.
Agreements that accommodate sales, services and other
types of electronic commerce will be treated. The
session will consider approaches to modifying model
agreements, accommodating scaling and automating
computer-based contracting mechanisms. Various model
agreements, including the soon-to-be released
European/TEDIS agreement will be addressed.
2. ELECTRONIC NEGOTIABILITY - WHAT SCARES THE EDI USERS
Few EDI issues cause such angst in the EDI community
as the issue of negotiability under EDI - whether it is for
securities, bills of lading, letters of credit, or any other
device that depends upon paper to transfer things of
value. Is it the horrendous legal pitfalls that EDI
negotiability presents as some would claim? Or is it that
last vestige of paper that we all are reluctant to let go
of, that causes us to hesitate before committing ourselves
to an all EDI world of commerce? The history of and
current efforts to develop electronic mechanisms in
substitution for paper-based documents of title will be
examined during this session. The panel will address the
major initiatives intended to substitute or accommodate
negotiable and nonnegotiable documents of title in
electronic form, and will explore possible solutions.
3. INFOSEC STANDARDS - POLICY, COORDINATION AND
This panel will deal with current and future policy on
information security standardization at the international,
regional and national levels, in particular, with regard to
information security standards as they apply to electronic
trade and commerce. It will also share thoughts and
perspectives concerning future standards direction, work
programs, interworking, and coordination.
4. TIME/DATE STAMPING - OPTIONS AND CONSTRAINTS
Time and date stamping of computer-based transactions
is increasingly recognized as being critical to
nonrepudiation, effective public key certificate and
certificate revocation management, and EDI in general.
This session will survey the technology, implementations
and legal requirements for time and date stamping and
consider the extent to which trusted entities are needed
to implement time and date stamping procedures and
devices, as well as the implications of electronic rather
than human time stamping.
SESSION 4: 15:00 - 16:20
1. MODEL ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS AGREEMENTS
Financial EDI is increasingly a growing and
indispensable aspect of electronic commerce. However,
it also presents additional challenges beyond those
covered by standard EDI trading partner agreements and
practices. This session outlines the legal treatment of
financial EDI, its relationship to EFT and funds transfer
mechanisms, and the responsive model financial EDI
agreements, guidelines and critical law reform
2. WHAT TO SAVE, WHEN TO SAVE IT, AND FOR HOW LONG
How long should transactions be saved? Are electronic
documents subject to different retention rules?
International trade rules are in play respecting retention
matters. In the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service
published Revenue Procedure 91-59 to address the
electronic retention period and audit procedures for the
electronic trade environment. To what extent does this
Revenue Procedure as well as other national and
international procedures provide useful models for
international harmonization? This session will address
the pros and cons of using such procedures to change
company internal records retention  policies.
3. DO "SMART CARDS" PROVIDE AN "ULTIMATE" CONTROL
The need for, and use of, card technologies, including
magnetic stripe, smart cards, and PCMCIA, presents new
options and challenges for the audit, legal and security
communities. The policy issues associated with card
technologies have already surfaced within the electronic
benefit transfer, healthcare informatics, financial
services and many other environments. The panel will
identify the various card technologies and explore the
relevant issues, including those concerning ownership of
data on the card, impact on satisfaction of signature
requirements and cost justification.
4. THE "FAST" INITIATIVE - BUSINESS TRUST IN THE
COMPUTER ERA?
The International Bureau of Chambers of Commerce
(IBCC) - world forum of Chambers of Commerce (of the
International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)), is setting
up an international "registration" and "certification"
chain within EDI. Coordinated by the Belgian Federation
of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the backbone
of the Certified Electronic Data Interchange For
Administration, Commerce and Transport (CEDI-
FACT) concept included in "FAST" (First Attempt to
Security Electronic Commerce), a trans-European and
trans-sectoral pilot project that will soon commence
under the auspices of the TEDIS program of the
Commission of the European Communities.
TUESDAY, JANUARY 18TH - MORNING SESSIONS
1. NEGOTIATING ELECTRONIC TRADE AGREEMENTS
A common stumbling block in implementing electronic
trade is the length of time it takes for companies to
negotiate electronic trade agreements. In this session you
will witness a simulated negotiation session between two
trading partners and their counsel. The dialogue will
communicate the benefits and costs of using standard
agreements that are recognized by the majority of
industries, as well as the benefits and cost of not using
a trading partner agreement.
2. BACK-UP, ARCHIVAL AND CONTINGENCY PLANNING IN ELECTRONIC COMMERCE ACCELERATED TRANSACTION OR J.I.T. ENVIRONMENT
Increasingly, the failure to contract for contingency
services may create significant exposure, perhaps
extending to consequential damages. Moreover, the
impact of expedited electronic transactions such as just-
in-time and quick response demand further consideration
of contingency services. This session debates an
appropriate definition of "due diligence" in electronic
commerce; the issues addressed in most commercial
contingency services agreements, and concludes with
predictions on future  issues by a panel of recognized
3. SECURITY POLICY IN A GLOBAL INFORMATION This session provides an opportunity to hear two of the
key security policy makers from the Commission of the
European Communities and the United States,
respectively. The speakers will address critical
developing information security policy issues of far
reaching consequence, including whether public key
infrastructure can or should be implemented for both
authentication and confidentiality services or instead for
authentication only; the scope and impact of pilot
projects on cryptographic and secured open systems
policy development; the impact of patents on the
development of ubiquitous secure infrastructure; and
cooperative approaches to a global path forward that will
minimize national and regional fragmentation.
4. ELECTRONIC SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION (ESD) - A PANDORA'S
As in every industry, there are commercial conduct rules
that apply to the software industry. As new methods of
distribution are introduced (discussed) in order to make
it easier for customers of software developers to obtain
and manage software assets within a corporation,
domestic and global legal implications are raised. This
session will discuss issues surrounding ESD and the
proposals to remedy them. Additionally, critical new
technologies and actual implementations will be
identified and demonstrated, with a view towards their
security and control capabilities.
SESSION 7: 9:30 - 10:50
1. THE INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE COMMERCE INITIATIVES
The ICC and its national affiliates (such as the U.S.
Council for International Business) have played a
continuing role in the development of electronic
commerce rules and practices, beginning with the
seminal publication of the "UNCID" rules, and
subsequently with initiatives for "EDI-TERMS", "EDI-
ready" INCOTERMS, and other projects. This session
will identify relevant ICC electronic commerce
initiatives, describe the ICC's future role, including
with regard to other international organizations, and
consider the ICC's and USCIB's work in addressing other
information policy and security issues confronting the
global business community.
2. ADMITTING, PROVING, AND ENFORCING EDI TRANSACTIONS
This session will focus on the evidentiary requirements
for electronic trade records and will contrast
requirements for records in paper and electronic form.
Diverse interpretations of foundation requirements of the
Federal Rules of Evidence, key regulatory requirements,
and related issues, including a status report on efforts
to reform the Federal Rules of Evidence that are relevant
to computer-based practices will be presented.
3. RE-ENGINEERING THE TAX FILING PROCESSES
Tax authorities will explain how they are dealing with
the electronic trade environment; and the policy, legal
and security issues involved in electronically interfacing
with national Governments. The implications of these
activities on electronic commerce generally will be
the focal point for this session. Additionally, it will
consider intergovernmental relationships concerning
authority to operate as a VAN or service bureau for the
other, including the TaxNet Government Communications
Corporation (TGCC) initiatives.
4. EDI INSURANCE - THE NEXT CONTROL APPROACH?
This panel will discuss the issues and opportunities
associated with offering and underwriting electronic
information-related risks.. This session surveys important
insurance issues that are either directly applicable to
electronic commerce and cryptography, or that indirectly
provide useful structures which can benefit the
thoughtful consideration of competing approaches to
such infrastructure. The discussion considers
insurance issues in EDI, EFT, VANS, and certification
authorities. To the extent insurance exists, the panelists
will discuss general restrictions and what electronic
information users and vendors can do to standardize and
structure their systems to assist the insurance industry
with broadening the scope of coverages.
TUESDAY, JANUARY 18TH - AFTERNOON SESSIONS
1. CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN ELECTRONIC TRADE - STATUS AND FUTURE OPTIONS
This session will discuss the present position of several
normative acts and legislative proposals in the Central
and East European countries that are of importance for
the development and use of EDI including: the status of
electronic evidence, the possibilities for electronic
contracting, and the legal requirements of "writing" and
"signature". The case for new legislation in Central and
Eastern Europe, assimilating the consequences of the
development and use of computer applications on the
traditional legal system, as well as the recent proposal
for a new Civil Code of the Russian Federation that
contains a specific regulation on an electronic version of
negotiable documents, will be discussed.
2. THE ROLE AND FUTURE OF NOTARIES IN COMPUTER-BASED
This session defines and explains conventional notary
laws and practice in both common law and civil law
countries; and considers the business and legal need for
notarial reform to accommodate electronic transactions.
It will also examine the use and sufficiency of forms of
identification as a prerequisite to the issuance of
electronic credentials. Furthermore, the session will
provide perspectives on notarial reform, including
whether current notarial practice can accommodate
electronic commerce, or whether there is a need for an
"electronic notary," a "super notary" or other such
"trusted entities." A panel of distinguished notaires from
around the world will consider whether a Latin-style
notary can or should be introduced in non-civil law
countries and will forecast the future for notaries in a
computer-based world.
3. WILL HEALTHCARE REFORM PROFOUNDLY RESHAPE EDI POLICY AND CONTROLS?
Privacy and security issues surrounding the use of EDI
are advancing to the top of the priorities in the health-
care field. Healthcare costs are a prime concern of
governments and individuals. However, with the rapid
growth of health care information networks and regional
or community healthcare networks, the capture, storage
and retrieval of health care data is essential to the
quality of the health care delivered. Data ownership and
access rights are unresolved, as well as the apportionment
of liability for erroneous or improperly disclosed data.
Moreover, the lack of a national (U.S.) personal
ID/national identifier presents privacy and security
challenges for healthcare and electronic commerce
generally.  These issues, with a focus on confidentiality
and privacy issues will be discussed in depth by leading
experts in health care law and EDI.
4. THE USES OF ESCROW IN ELECTRONIC COMMERCE
The scope of escrow agents is much broader in electronic
commerce than in the computer software industry.
Escrow agents are increasingly being used to hold
cryptographic keys associated with the privacy or
authenticity of business transactions. This session will
explain the world of escrow and how it can improve
electronic commerce. The escrow implications of the
Clinton Administration's "Clipper Capstone" proposal
will also be addressed. Copies of escrow agreements will
be distributed and discussed.

@_subject: RSA in new Apple productRSA in new Apple product 
published by "Adam C. Engst" :
------------------- forward ---------------------------------------
Key Chain
  The Key Chain is the third new Desktop icon and perhaps the most
  important PowerTalk feature. It provides quick, transparent access
  to any number of password-protected servers or services through a
  single system-wide logon password. All applications and services
  are integrated with a single security model. For every service,
  the user creates a key. Each key has account information,
  communications settings (such as. modem settings, addresses, and
  system identifiers), and an encrypted password. After this one-
  time setup, the user attaches the key to the Key Chain and can
  forget the password. From now on, the system will automatically
  and transparently connect to the protected service when needed.
  Apple feels that this mechanism is especially secure since a user
  will find it easier to remember a single, frequently-used password
  and will be less likely to write down a list of passwords. At any
  time, you can lock the Key Chain by issuing a command or through
  an inactivity time-out. When the Key Chain locks, all windows
  containing information from protected services are hidden.
  Apple claims that PowerTalk is more secure than most other off-
  the-shelf software solutions since those use less secure
  algorithms to avoid export restrictions. Apple is the first
  company to receive an export license for a DES-based product.
  A new "I am at..." menu item (e.g. Home, Office, Car, Hotel) lets
  the system know which services are accessible and automatically
  resets communications settings for Ethernet, modem connection,
  packet radio, etc. so the system can continue to transparently
  establish connections over available media.
  A PowerTalk server can act as a trusted party in establishing
  authenticated communications across the net. Network traffic is
  encrypted with the RC4 algorithm of RSA and delivered via ASDSP
  (Apple Secure Datastream Protocol). ASDSP adds only about ten
  percent to the communication overhead. At least in the initial
  release, peer-to-peer traffic cannot be encrypted. [Sorry for all
  the acronyms! RSA is a company. -Tonya]
  Digital signatures, based on RSA Public Key Encryption, provide a
  secure way of ensuring data has not been altered and was signed by
  a particular person. The mechanism is similar to Kerberos [a
  security system developed at MIT -Adam], which was not mature
  enough at the critical point in PowerTalk development. Apple
  anticipates supporting Kerberos in a future PowerTalk release.
  To sign a document, simply drops it on a Signer icon. A prompt for
  the personal signer code then appears on the screen. If the
  content of the signed document later changes in any way, the
  signature becomes invalid. While being signed, a file
  automatically is locked to avoid inadvertent invalidation. The Get
  Info window of a signed file is used to uncheck the file lock, and
  it contains a Verify button with which the recipient can assert
  the integrity of the file and authenticity of its signature.
  Large companies can become trusted signature issuing agents for
  their employees by obtaining a titanium blackbox with key
  interlocks from RSA. The box contains a certain number of key
  combinations and can be connected to a Macintosh which runs an
  RSA-signed signature issuing application. Individuals can acquire
  a personal signature code through a notary. RSA always is at the
  root of the issuing process and signatures expire after two years.
  The issuing cost of a digital signature runs about $25.
  One limitation of the signature mechanism, at least in the initial
  implementation, is that only one signature can be attached to a
  document. This may be worked around by designing forms such that
  each signatory vouches for the authenticity of the previous
  sender's signature.

@_subject: Internet Security Scanner, description 
Just in case you think your machine on the Internet is secure enough for
remailers, storing private files, etc. here's the author's description from the source code shell archive as posted to comp.sources.misc.
It would be a big confidence booster if remailer sites demonstrate
that they have passed ISS and other Internet security tests.
Internet Security Scanner (ISS) is one of the first multi-level security
scanners available to the public.  It was designed to be flexible and easily
portable to many unix platforms and do its job in a reasonable amount of
time.  It provides information to the administrator that will fix obvious
security misconfigurations.
ISS does a multi-level scan of security, not just searching for one
weakness in the system.  To provide this to the public or at least to the
security conscious crowd may cause people to think that it is too dangerous
for the public, but many of the (cr/h)ackers are already aware of these
security holes and know how to exploit them.
These security holes are not deep in some OS routines, but standard
misconfigurations that many domains on Internet tend to show.  Many of these
holes are warned about in CERT and CIAC advisories.  This is the first
release of ISS and there is still much room for improvement.
ISS is a project that I started as I became interested in security.  As I
heard about (cr/h)ackers breaking into NASA and universities around the
world, I wanted to find out the deep secrets of security and how these people
were able to gain access to expensive machines that I would think were
secure.  I searched Internet for relative information, such as Phrack and
CERT advisories.
Most information was vague and did not explain how intruders were able to
gain access to most systems.  At most the information told administrators to
make password security tighter and to apply the vendor's security patches.
They lacked real information on how an intruder would look at a site to try
to gain access.  Having talked with security experts and reading CERT
advisories, I started trying to look for various security holes within my
To my surprise, I noticed that many of machines were adequately secured,
but within a domain there remained enough machines with obvious holes that
anyone wanted into any machine could attack the weak 'trusted' machine and
from there could gain access to the rest of the domain. From this project, I
have not learned any new deep secret to cracking systems, but with the right
tools that most domains on Internet are insecure.  These holes will not be a
surprise to any advanced intruder, but with this tool administrators will be
able to quickly search for obvious holes and prepare to fix them.

  This is exactly what you don't want to happen, unless of course you
want shoddy protocols and kludges. Most of the govt services on the net
are the worst software I've ever seen including Nasa Spacelink,
Library of Congress Information System, etc
  Translation: $25-50 billion dollars tax increase for the middle class.
FCC and Rep. Markey become King of the Net.
  IRC, MUDs, Usenet, E-mail. Amazingly, people find ways of developing these
things without govt input.
  Regulations on commercial speech, market quotas?
  This is the worst part of the proposal. If this rule is followed, the
NII will never be finished in my lifetime. And you thought congressional
gridlock was bad.
  Government mandated user interface? ugh.
  I really don't see why we need NII at all. We already have internet.
Cable companies are rushing to provide high bandwidth networks for consumers.
NII seems to be nothing more than WelfareNet. Which isn't surpising since
CPSR praises systems like IGC (Econet, PeaceNet, etc) which are much more
expensive than Netcom, Panix, Digex, and provide shoddier service.

@_subject: Some possible projects/topics for CypherPunks 
Here's some topics that I've been wanting to bring up with
the CypherPunks.  I figured it'd be best to just drop one email/post
rather than 4.
1. HARDWARE:  What about building our own machines?  This is the Vinge-ian
   crypto-anarchy theme ultimately.  We should be able to produce our own
   technology,  and not depend on the merchantile/government-mandated
   economic system/monopolies.
   I see this as being very important to the oceania/autopia/technomad
   ideas and projects of creating ocean-going free societies.
   Or is anyone interested in starting a parallel list of sorts for the
   hardware-punks?  'ware-punks?  :-)  or perhaps an even better name
   would be The Homebrew Computer Club^2.
2. STEGENOGRAPHY: Using the genome project data listings
   (bionet.molbio.genbank.updates) as a stegenographic source to    hide encrypted info in.  Similar to the alt.w.a.s.t.e NG,
   but more public.  Of course, it'd be bad if your ecrypted data    got credited with curing/causing a genetic disease.... =>
3. PUNK-NET:  (see HARDWARE above)
4. POLITICS/ANONYMITY:  I may have missed this, but has anyone
   discussed Gibson's "The Republic of Desire" idea of having a
   network based guerilla organization?  Not that we need to be
   guerilla's yet, but...
   I think the guerilla cell organization would probably lend itself
   to using the DC-net protocols, and developing webs-of-trust
   organizations.  Thoughts, comments, etc?
                                              sweetly,

  that they *think* they'll remember when they next decide to

The remailer at elee9sf at menudo.uh.edu now pads messages.
So as not to be too annoying, messages under 1K are padded to 1K;
larger messages are untouched.  Padding is calculated by the size of
the message body as it goes to sendmail - the header doesn't enter in
the calculation.
This remailer also caches messages until midnight; this is being
mailed out early because I forced it.
This message is shorter than 1K, so there will be some padding below
(after the signature block).

Yes, but this doesn't provide the service I desire. I *want* to be able
to sign a message, but I *only* want the intended recipient to know who
I am. PEM discloses the originator's ID *in the clear* when I send a
signed message. PGP hides the signature and all other information that
identifies me within the encrypted portion of the message!

@_subject: Anonymous Forwarding 
Do you have spare email accounts laying around?
  Would you like to have them forward mail to your main account anonymously?
  These are the questions which led me to hack up an anonymous .forward
technique. I figured that I'd use a spare account to receive mail which I normally wouldn't want connected to my main address. Furthermore, mail
forwarded to my main email address would be automatically encrypted to
prevent the prying eyes of the sysadmin from snooping.
Anonymous Forwarding
  Using my anonymous-forwarding script I have thrown together a kludgy
anonymous mailing list program. Not only are the users on this list totally
anonymous but the list address itself is secret! (Don't ya just love
double-blind mechanisms?)
  To subscribe, users simply pgp encrypt a "Request-Remailing-To:"
block as I detailed above and send it to the list request address. The
list software sends out messages using the exact same script as
anonymous-forward. At no time does the mailing list software see the
real e-mail address. Only by collaborating with the operators of anonymous remailers can the list operator find out the real
address of a user.
  The list address itself is also secret. Ihe true address is embedded
in an encrypted "Request-Remailing-To:" block and chained through several
remailers. Users post to the mailing list by adding their response to the
encrypted return block and sending it to the first anonymous remailer in the chain. (the list software automatically puts the list's return block
at the start of every message for easy response. [no cut/pasting needed])
Hopes, Dreams, and Bugs
  Obviously, with the small number of remailers on the net, and most of
them running from multiuser machines and student accounts, security is
not high. As the number of remailers increase, the probability of a bunch
of remailer operators all collaborating is small. If remailers ever
reach the level of popularity of gopher/fsp sites, it would be near impossible to shut down an anonymous mailing list. (there's no postmaster
to complain to because you don't know the true address!)
  Alas, there is currently no way of returning error messages so if something
bad happens, you aren't notified. Shutting down a single remailer in the
chain would be very harmful. A fault-tolerant mechanism is needed and
a robust way of returning error messages.
p.s. If I have reinvented the wheel, ignore this message. I didn't see
any anonymous forwarding/anonymous list software on soda so I figured no one
had written any.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
A new trade association, the National Online Media Association
(NOMA), was formed at ONE BBSCON '93 in Colorado Springs on August
27th, 1993.  NOMA comprises BBS operators, Internet service
providers, and other online media and services.
NOMA's mission is to act for the BBS and online service industry
on matters of national importance by creating an industry presence
in Washington, D.C. and other means; assist its members at the
state and local levels; educate the public on the unique social,
business and legal roles of BBS's and other online services;
establish appropriate industry standards and guidelines;
promote business development in the industry; and maintain and
provide access to resources and industry information for use by the
public and the industry.
An 11 person Organizing Committee was elected to develop a proposal
for NOMA's charter, bylaws, membership requirements, structure, and
form of leadership.  The proposal is to be completed and
distributed within the BBS and online services industry by November
30th, 1993.
Discussion areas are being set up immediately for those interested
in participating in NOMA's early development.  An Internet mailing
list is available to all those interested at natbbs at echonyc.com
(subscribe to natbbs-request at echonyc.com).  A conference area is
also being made available on the Delphi national information

@_subject: EC isn't great for privacy either... 
Don't rush out to get your EC passport yet. Below I have included some
exerpts from the EC Information Technology Security Document (ITSEC, aka
Green Book). The referenced sections are from the "Confidentiality" section.
I have put "..."'s where I have skipped over material and all upper case
words are emphasis that I have added.
For those who don't want to read it all, the gist of it is that the EC
folks are also interested in maintaining the government's ability to
intercept private communications. There is also talk about licensing
businesses to use good confidentiality services. Btw. There is also
a mention of PGP which I have left. Its the paragraph right before the
one that mentions Clipper!
--Begin Enclosure
\subsection{Privacy enhancement issues}
\subsubsection{Perception of requirements for privacy enhancement}
Confidentiality is, at times, essential for the good functioning of
administrations, business and human relations.
Most business and private users of communication systems are aware of
the conflict between their confidentiality requirements and national
security issues which require the possibility to intercept the
communication in a way regulated by national laws. They accept the
national authorities ability for this interception provided there are
adequate safeguards to prevent unauthorised interception even by
government employees.
{\bf Service provision}
The extent to which confidentiality services are provided for a
specific business or citizen could depend on a system of LICENSES or
A particular business might qualify for a CONFIDENTIALITY LICENSE
depending on its internal procedures and activities. A general
(minimum) level of confidentiality could be provided to all users.
It should be possible for certain user groups or businesses to use
other confidential services (egproprietary) than the standard ones
There are strong indications of emerging ``bottom up'' solutions for
these needs (eg the Pretty Good Privacy offering on Internet,
beginning 1993).
Other initiatives (eg the announcement of the ``Clipper Chip'', 16 April
1993) illustrate the growing awareness of governments of the needs of
their citizens for confidentiality services.
If a public confidentiality scheme is offered, organised crime could
also subscribe to such a scheme, but as it would include provisions
for legal intercept, it would hardly be attractive. One would expect
that such users would continue to find their own solutions as will the
classified domain.
An open and public service offering a credible level of
confidentiality would therefore provide for the honest user, while not
worsening the situation with respect to public order or national
The combination of international communication and national security
regulations require a common framework for confidentiality services,
which on the one hand interoperate within all Community Member States
as well as with countries outside the Community which themselves may
establish their confidentiality services. This requires either an
overlay approach or gateways which link the different national or
regional services. These gateways are only required where
multinational agreements for co-operation on national security
concerns is not yet established. In this case these gateways may
provide at least an interim solution.

Some recent "warez" posts from alt.security....
Newsgroups: alt.security
Path: netcom.com!netcomsv!decwrl!olivea!sgigate!sgi!wdl1!mail!klaus
Lines: 41
Okay, I got some email flaming me for making accusations about these 'warez'
lists.  Apparently, not all the sites in the lists contained actual warez
due to the list being outdated and as the list said it contained some sites
that were beneficial to software pirates but didnt contain any warez.  I
guess if someone wants to stress that because some of the sites werent infact
a warez site, that the lists I published werent actual warez lists. Thats fine.
So next time, Ill say this list MAY contain sites that support warez, but these
are not actual warez lists.   I hope that helps someone.  If you are the one
complaining about not going through the list and emailing each of the sites
about the possibility of a warez site, write a script for me. :)  I am not
going to work overtime to track down the evils of the net.  I dont have time
to check 400 sites if they are valid for warez.  Apparently quite a few sites
must have had actual warez, otherwise  Anti-track and other
pirates would not have been irate about such lists if it didn't contain
any 'warez sites'.    I find it ironic that many of the admins complained the lists were outdated
and useless (maybe they have access to better lists than me) while the pirates
complained it was one of the best lists ever produced.  In publishing
those lists, my point was that there is an organized crime on Internet
that maybe some admins should be aware of. I do not believe by publishing
those lists that much piracy has been crushed on Internet.
As far as the guys saying how insecure fsp and ftp is because it is so
easy for an admin to look at network statistics and notice the large amounts
of traffic for software piracy, I find it funny those so much pirating
is done without admins ever noticing. And it usually gets noticed
because of lack of hard drive space, not amount of network traffic.
And when 200 users are using some LAN, I really doubt you would notice
an enmormous jump in network traffic anyways, due to people ftp'ing
all the time as it is.  Not to mention it would be rather hard to
find out what kind of network traffic is going through
all the ports, without violating the privacy of the users.

They thought of this. The Skipjack algorithm is programmed into the
chip at the same time the escrowed keys are. If you steal the unprogrammed
chips you may learn the list of basic operations that are part of
Skipjack. However there are also basic operations implemented on the
chip which are *not* part of Skipjack but are there just to confuse
someone who would disassemble a chip.
Btw. This also means that the actual chip assembly line does not require

This is normal. PGP labels each message with a byte that defines its type
(for messages between people this is a byte that indicates that what follows
is public key encrypted) followed by type dependant information. Among the
things in the first bunch of bytes are the KeyID (low order 64 bits, so this
is eight of the bytes you see) of the destination's key. If you are always
sending to the same person (i.e., the same key) these will always be the same.

@_subject: Filing Income Taxes Electronically 
Forwarded from alt.internet.services:
I've been involved with electronic tax filing (EFT) for
six years now. I develope and sell a tax filing package
which allows you to basically enter the data from a completed
return and transfer directly to the IRS or to one of our
transmission sites. This is a tax filing not a tax prep
program. Our main market is tax preparers who buy the program
and transmitt direct to the IRS, tax preparers who register
with us and transmitt returns to us to transmitt to the IRS
and tax preparers who fax us returns and we enter the data
and transmitt.
As for specifics, yes you need a bell 208 modem to send
directly to the IRS. The IRS has several transmission sites
all over the country which processes everybody`s returns.
And they have a set schedule of when a refund is sent.
Basically returns are processed every Tuesday night. What
this means is that if your return has been sent and passed
the IRS acceptanced tests by Monday night the IRS will
process it Tuesday and if you do direct deposit it will be in
your bank account in 10 days, if you have it mailed it will be mailed in 12 days. So if you do file electronicaly DO NOT get
a Refund Anticipated Loan (RAL) unless your electricity is already
off :-). A RAL will get you your money in 3 to 5 days at pre-fixed
fee which averages to be about a 150% loan interest rate for a
at most 7 day loan.
If your interested in doing EFT from your home IBM or clone let me know.
We also work with non tax preparers who have registered with the
IRS to do electronic filing and have a electronic filing indentification
number (EFIN). The IRS can give you these rather quickly, they do a background check to see if you do not owe back taxes or have been
convicted of any felonies and if that works you get a EFIN. Once you
have an EFIN we can work with you to set you up for EFT. Basically
if you transmitt to us we give you the software and charge you per return.
What you do is find your clients ( and they are your clients you must
see then personally and have them sign a EFT form which gets sent with
their W2s to the IRS by you ) enter there returns with our software
and send to one of our transmission sites.
If interested or any other questions relating to EFT let me know.

You are cordially invited to participate in a meeting of the above-
referenced work groups of the Information Security Committee on
Wednesday-Thursday, January 19-20, 1994. These interdisciplinary work
groups will continue to address conventional and electronic notarization
and certification authority issues. The meetings are focused around the
work product of its respective participants and will be highly results
At the last meeting, further progress was made on the development of
"Model Certification Authority Guidelines/Rules of Practice
("Guideline") to provide a legal framework for the use of certificate-
based public key cryptography. Also, proposals were further debated and
developed including for: (i) the creation of a new ABA accreditation/-
specialization "attorney-notary;" (ii) a "Clipper Resolution;" and (iii)
alternative dispute resolution for CAs.
Professor Carl Felsenfeld has secured the use of the Faculty Reading
Room of Fordham Law School in New York City. The meeting agenda and
logistics are attached. I look forward to seeing you in New York.

@_subject: Public key encryption, income tax and government 
I don't agree with the extreme position that cryptography will lead to
the failure of the income tax and the destruction of the government.
Consider: untraceable, anonymous transactions occur every day - not
through cryptography, but through simple cash purchases at the local
grocery store, gas station, department store, restaurant, and so on.
There are many occupations which primarily involve cash transactions.
Are these people immune from income tax?  Of course not.  The
government has many ways of extracting tax in these cases, ranging from
periodic audits with heavy penalties (which keep people honest) to
imputing income (as in the case of tip income by waiters), to fraud
investigations for those living beyond their means.
As I see it, cryptography may extend similar conditions to information
workers - programmers, architects, authors.  Naturally, since a
disproportionate number of those on the net fall into these categories,
this seems like a revolutionary development.  But from the larger
perspective, it is not a major change.
The fact is, information purchases are a small part of most people's
budgets.  If you add up all of what the average person purchases that
would fall into the general category of "information" - books,
magazines, newspapers, music, video - you probably won't exceed a few
percent of income.  Information, despite the hype, is not a dominant
part of our economy.
Particularly at the corporate level, the notion that cryptography will
allow widespread tax cheating seems especially questionable.  I don't
agree that the major force for tax compliance is government
surveillance of telephone and electronic communications.  Instead, the
corporations have to keep books which reflect their financial
transactions, and they have to make appropriate reports to the
government and investors.  To cheat they'd have to have two sets of
books, with all the concomitant risks.  It would be difficult to pass
on the illegal gains to shareholders because they wouldn't match up
with what was reported to the governments.  Perhaps the beneficiaries
in this scenario are the corporate officers?  This sounds like simple
fraud, and I doubt that the shareholders would allow their investments
to be jeapordized in this fashion.
Suppose I walk into IBM today and offer to go to work as a programmer,
for 10% less than they would normally pay me, as long as they pay me
"off the books", and pass on to me in cash the amount they would
normally have to pay to the government in payroll taxes.  Sounds like a
win-win situation, right?  Both IBM and I save money.  But naturally
IBM won't agree to this.  And it's not because they're afraid of
government bugging of their phones, which cryptography might overcome.
They know that there are many ways a scheme like this can be detected.
I don't think this will change once strong cryptography allows me to
make the same offer to IBM across the net.  Sure, my electronic
conversations with IBM will be private - but my conversations in the
example above were just as private.  The advent of cryptography will
not change the fact that violating the tax laws is a serious,
difficult, and very risky business.
Now, I don't know much about high finance, so it's hard for me to judge
what the effects would be of cryptographically-protected communications
with offshore banks.  Again, I am skeptical that the main barrier to
such widespread tax evasion that the government would collapse is the
government's ability to eavesdrop on electronic communications.  I was
under the impression that money transfers have used the Data Encryption
Standard for years, which is not known to be breakable, and yet
government has survived.
Summing up, the main change I see cryptography bringing is to extend to
information workers some of the same possibilities for anonymous,
private cash transactions that plumbers and shopkeepers have always
had.  Even then, big business will continue to operate under the
present rules.  I don't see this as a major change in society.
I might add that over-hyping of the changes due to cryptography is
actually counterproductive.  To the extent that law enforcement
believes these projections, the government will oppose simple
cryptographic technologies that do have an important role to play in
preserving privacy.

@_subject: Skepticism on the Detweiler Conspiracy Claims 
Detweiler says we don't understand that `all that is required for the spread
of evil is for good people to do nothing' Understand it?  Yes.  Believe it completely, or even believe that it applies here?  No. May's beliefs that pseudo-spoofing can lead to monetary and governmental anarchy have little connection in reality, despite the writings of Bruce Sterling and Vernor Vinge.  In that context, May's pseudo-spoofing is little more than childish play-acting. In any event, we need far more evidence to come to light before Occam's razor can even be applied.  ``in other words, `entertain me some more, detweiler. I don't believe you yet, but maybe, just maybe, you will find something that convinces me. for now, I simply don't give a damn either way, and most of all I am not going to post, even though there are some things I would like to post on, because I am a sheep like the rest of humanity, and while these people could be dangerous lunatics out for revenge on anyone who posts, how could these highly respectable people be behind a conspiracy?''   Take out everything above before "I don't..." and after "...not going to post", and you're close.  You're right, they could be dangerous lunatics out for revenge on anyone who posts.  So could you.  Are they respectable?  Who knows?  Who cares, given that their sphere of influence is so incredibly small? Convince me.  I'm a fairly hard-core skeptic -- I don't believe *anything* until I can weigh the facts on both sides.  You've told me that Geoff Dale sent you mail implying that Nick Szabo was *not* his roommate, but something tells me that you believed Szabo wasn't real long before that.  Why?  What led you to that conclusion. Posting the evidence would help convince other skeptics, especially if it's concrete enough. -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -   ``Death is the ultimate form of censorship.''

@_subject: Electronic tax filing 
This raises some interesting security issues.  Elsewhere
is was reported that no encryption is used between the home
PC and the central transmission site.
forwarded from alt.internet.services:
I`ve gotten many request for further info so I`ll just repost
the details here.
I've been involved with electronic tax filing (EFT) for
six years now. I develope and sell a tax filing package
which allows you to basically enter the data from a completed
return and transfer directly to the IRS or to one of our
transmission sites. This is a tax filing not a tax prep
program. Our main market is tax preparers who buy the program
and transmitt direct to the IRS, tax preparers who register
with us and transmitt returns to us to transmitt to the IRS
and tax preparers who fax us returns and we enter the data
and transmitt.
The IRS has several transmission sites
all over the country which processes everybody`s returns.
And they have a set schedule of when a refund is sent.
Basically returns are processed every Tuesday night. What
this means is that if your return has been sent and passed
the IRS acceptanced tests by Monday night the IRS will
process it Tuesday and if you do direct deposit it will be in
your bank account in 10 days, if you have it mailed it will be mailed in 12 days.
If your interested in doing EFT from your home IBM or clone let me know.
We also work with non tax preparers who have registered with the
IRS to do electronic filing and have a electronic filing indentification
number (EFIN). The IRS can give you these rather quickly, they do a background check to see if you do not owe back taxes or have been
convicted of any felonies and if that works you get a EFIN. Once you
have an EFIN we can work with you to set you up for EFT. Basically
if you transmitt to us we give you the software and charge you per return.
What you do is find your clients ( and they are your clients you must
see then personally and have them sign a EFT form which gets sent with
their W2s to the IRS by you ) enter there returns with our software
and send to one of our transmission sites.
If your interested in filing taxes electronicaly ( not preparing )
you need to contact the IRS to get your EFIN number. There is no
fee to get a EFIN number, you must file a form with the IRS and pass their background check.
If you do this and would like to work with us you need to register
which is $20. After that we will send you the data entry program
and the charge will be $3 per return with a minimun charge of
$5 for each data file of returns you send us. This simple means
that you send us a data file over modem of 1 return we will charge $5.
If it has 2 returns it would be $6 which is $3 per return. After you
file 100 returns through us the price will drop to $2 per return but
there will still be the $5 minimun per data file ( a data file can have
up to 500 returns ).
What you charge the taxpayer for filing his taxes is your decision.
Charges vary from around $15 to $75 for filing.
If you want to register call 614-676-1333 or 614-676-5666
but contact the IRS first to get your EFIN. Electronic filing
runs from Jan 11 to Aug 15.

@_subject: Detweiler is really losing it... 
Question: has anybody actually had any contact with Detweiler recently?
I know he used to be a rational and respectable Usetter; keeper of
the Privacy FAQ, runner of an autoposter service for other people's
FAQs, etc. I'd like to think this is all somebody's research project
or piece of performance art, but otherwise... it's pretty ugly to
watch this disintegration happen.  The deterioration has been
marked even within the last few weeks. The RISKS posting was coherent
enough, and no more paranoid than say, the average talk.politics.guns
poster. My opinion is just from his language, logic, reaction to other
people - whether his conspiracy theories are true are not is pretty
irrelevant. Multiple identites mapping to one person is hardly
unusual in electronic spaces, but most people regard tracking them
down as a challenge or an entertainment, not as the cause  for
 desperate rage and paranoia. Cf. the netsport of hunting down
John Palmer identities.
Is he actually a student at Colorado State? If so, and he's genuinely
sending out death threats, the recipients might seriously consider
forwarding them there. Not to get him in trouble, but perhaps to get
someone to look into the situation before this accelerating downward
curve gets where ever it is going. There's plenty of nuts on the net,
but the level of their nuttiness is stable enough. I don't think I've
ever seen someone fall apart like this before.
Of course, maybe it *is* just performance art...

@_subject: Detweiler == Rotweiler 
I may have missed responses to my last post on the subject, but I
am wondering: what makes Detweiler think that T.C. May and Mayor Szabo
are the same person? How is this so critical to his argument that
he needs to spend half his waking hours ranting about it?
I'm still trying to figure out why it's critical to his argument.
The one time I started getting mail/flamage from someone who (from
writing patterns, nicknames, etc.) I thought was someone else, I
was pretty livid about it (Eric Hughes). I've since cooled down, after
he apologized, somewhat... but it doesn't change a thing about the argument itself. (Of course, I knew his argument was bunk to begin with).
But is Rotweiler so unable to address issues that he has to attribute
everyone with a roughly similar belief to be one person?
"It didn't take very much reductio to get right down to absurdium
from where you started."
                            --Mike Jones, jonesmd at crd.ge.com I think we're in the situation of trying to get *up* to absurdium.
Either Detweiler's a disturbed individual with some sort of multiple
personality disorder, or he's impersonating one.  Or, of course, the
GRAND CYPHERPUNK CONSPIRACY has been FORGING messages to LOOK like
they've come from L. Detweiler!  UN-altered REPRODUCTION and
DISSEMINATION of this IMPORTANT information is ENCOURAGED!
