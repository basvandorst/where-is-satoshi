Whoa! Much of content of the discussions I had with Mr. Levy
concerned the importance of protecting privacy and security for
everyone.  None of those comments made the cut.  Yes, I have
concerns about fully anonymous digital cash, but while I am not a
full on crypto-anarchist, neither am I a crypto-facist.
Let me ask you a question.  If people can communicate over the
net anonymously, tranmit unreadable messages, and transfer
unlimited amounts of fully anonymous money, haven't you, in
addition to protecting some of the interests of minorities, also
perfected a mechanism by which people with evil intent can engage
in criminal activities completely unobserved and with no fear of
prosecution?  How safe would you feel as an average private
citizen, a famous/wealthy citizen, a mail order retailer, a bank,
or a leader of a democracy?
I have always believed that people won't come outside to play
with you unless they feel safe.  We want electronic commerce to
work everywhere in the world.
The following is not flamebait!!!  If anyone can adequately
address the concerns of all of the above entities I can guarantee
you that they will become wealthy fast, if you don't address them
all there is a significant risk that you will fail.  If you have
the answer (and I haven't seen an adequate proposal yet) please
let me know and I will spread the word and clear the way.
Thanks for listening!...kawika...

Association Recommends a 10-year Extension for the Data
Encryption Standard
     WASHINGTON, July 21 -- The Data Encryption Standard (DES)
should be recertified for at least 10 more years to allow
interested financial institutions adequate time to convert to any
new cryptography standard, the American Bankers Association said
in a policy statement issued today.
     Encryption is the process whereby sensitive data
communications, such as wire transfers, credit card and automated
teller machine transactions, are protected by secret codes to
protect their confidentiality.   DES, released in 1977, is the
primary method used by financial institutions to encrypt
     Critics say that the longer DES is used, the more likely its
code could be broken.  While realizing this could limit its life
span as a government certified standard, ABA warned that
requiring banks to convert to a new standard by 1998 (the year
DES's certification expires) could be prohibitively costly due to
the high level of electronic funds transfers secured by DES.  ABA
therefore encouraged the National Institute for Standards
and Technology (NIST) to continue to endorse DES as a Federal
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for use by the financial
     There has been an ongoing debate regarding who should
control the development and support of private-sector computer
security standards:  the government or the private sector.  ABA strongly recommends that the U.S. government work with the
private sector and Congress in an open forum to develop a
comprehensive policy on the commercial use of cryptography.      In its newly-revised policy statement on cryptography, ABA
proposed alternatives  to DES and outlined other criteria that
must be met before changes in cryptographic standards can be
accepted by the banking industry.   These criteria -- which will
be presented next week to representatives of the White House,
U.S. Department of Commerce, National Security Agency (NSA) and
federal banking agencies -- were developed following a two-day
meeting held in June of bankers, vendors and crypto
experts concerned about the federal government's direction
regarding private-sector information security.      Specifically, ABA recommended:
     *  The financial services industry be allowed to continue to
use DES based on risk assessment (e.g. value of the transaction)
and the business application involved.      *  A security framework encompassing a family of
commercially available algorithms, including DES, be developed. This framework should include a process for negotiated algorithm
selection based on the level of risk and other business
requirements.       * Opposition to government mandated key management systems
for financial applications where keys would have to be stored
outside the financial institution  (e.g. key
registration/surrender or the mandatory escrow of cryptographic
keys).      Instead, banks should continue to be responsible for key
management and continue to cooperate with government for law
enforcement purposes, as required by law.
     * Export of cryptography for financial applications must not
be restricted.
     * Full participation of Congress and the private sector
before establishing a U.S. policy for the commercial use of
cryptography, instead of being carried out solely by Executive
     [Note:  These recommendations were summarized.  For the full
statement, please call Sonia Barbara at 202/663-5469.]
     The American Bankers Association is the only national trade
and professional association serving the entire banking
community, from small community banks to large bank holding
companies.  ABA members represent approximately 90 percent of the
commercial banking industry's total assets, and about 94 percent
of ABA members are community banks with assets less than $500

The brochure is too long to type in but some excerpts follow:
      10 key questions to be answered at this        critical industry event:
       10.  What are the biggest avenues to entry into the world
            of electronic commerce?
        9.  Who will be the biggest users of electronic money?
        8.  Who should be allowed to issue E-cash?
        7.  How will debit and checking fit in with the electronic
            money future?
        6.  How do you balance privacy, security, and efficiency in             E-cash systems?
        5.  How can electronic commerce be used for a business
            advantage?
        4.  How will the government regulate E-cash?
        3.  How will electronic payment systems protect against
            fraud?
        2.  What infrastructure is needed to provide security
            on open networks?
        1.  What are the leading technologies that will be used for             E-cash?

@_subject: (Fwd) DIGITAL CASH IN AN ELECTRONIC WORLD -Reply 
I am still lurking on the Information Railroad(TM)
I am still trying to preserve privacy while maintaining
accountability for all parties.  Technical solutions are
insufficient, no matter how innovative.  My greatest problem today is the lack of sophistication of
decisionmakers.  Very few people understand the technology,
economics, and politics of electronic commerce.  Keeping governments
from making the wrong decisions is difficult.  Keeping bankers from
doing the same is even more difficult.  Most of the discussion occurs
between bank marketing and R&D types.  Compliance, operations,
security, risk management, and legal counsel units within banks are
often uninformed about the efforts of the technology delivery groups.
It is also difficult to offer financial services to the new world. It is not easy to "know your customer," evaluate risks, and price the
risks when you cannot verify their identity or reach them easily. Bankers prefer orderly environments to anarchy.  So do governments.
      ****Extremely Personal Observation*****
So do I.  I like privacy, I do not need true anonymity nor do I wish
to engage in significant interaction or be exposed to anonymous
IF SOMEONE WEARING A HOOD OR A MASK COMES TO MY DOOR
THEY WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY VIEWED AS AN IMMEDIATE THREAT.
I may classify non-anonymous persons as threats after evaluating
available information.  Banks and governments will similarly look
askance at those who wish to wear masks when engaging in commerce.
Respectfully, Kawika Daguio
THE ABOVE ARE MY PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS
NO ONE IN SHOULD ATTRIBUTE THE SENTIMENTS
EXPRESSED TO THE ASSOCIATION OR OUR MEMBERS.

@_subject: 3DES weak because DES falls to brute-force? (was Re: JohnGilmore...) 
If you listen to those in the exploitation community you might hear that 3DES provides less comparable security relative to DES than you know or have stated.    Either way, however, it is more than sufficiently strong to secure any kind of traffic one might contemplate sending over a network.  3DES should work for a while, but I would prefer something more elegant and efficient.
We have pushed 3DES forward as an interim standard, and are moving 3DES out into the world and the AES (128 and 256) forward to provide us another long-term solution.   We told NIST that we hoped the AES could serve as a 20-30 year solution and are pushing algorithm agnostic standards to avoid similar obstacles to a transition in the far off future.
One of the reasons we so aggressively pursued the negotiations over export control with the Administration and have pushed the AES, and our PKI is the collateral damage from the export control legislative debate.   When the AES is finalized it will be followed closely by  an ANSI X9 standard.  Once these standards and infrastructure are established, the concerns about brute force attacks should be largely behind us.
my views only
Sigh.  One should not do math before coffee.
Let's try this again:
If you assume 2^56 requires $50k and 3 days, and are willing to take
2^8 times longer and spend 2^16 times more, and want to break a 2^112 bit
key, and assume technology doubles in performance for this particular
operation per year, then the calculation is easy to do.
112 - 56 - 16 - 8 = 32
If you wait 32 years, and have *incredible* performance gains in excess of
what we have now (but which I think could be possible for worst-case crypto
breaking chips, since they have relatively little in the way of communication,
and have small units), and have a budget of 16 times what the DES cracker
had (about $3b, which is totally reasonable), and are willing to wait about
2 years, you can brute force 3DES in the year 2030.
There is still very little that is relevant in 32 years, and there is still
a far better chance that some analytic attack will be discovered, a fundamental
breakthrough in computation will happen, etc. before that time.
112 bits is below the "physical impossibility" point as far as key size goes
(I like the calculation based on free energy in the universe in Applied Chapter 7 in Applied Crypto is probably a far better analysis than mine,
especially as it includes the caveat emptor section.
Perhaps it is correct, "It's time to bring on those 128, 192, and 256-bit at least for some systems, although I'd definitely prefer multiple ciphers
separately keyed with long keys than n-DES for such long-term use.
Calculating future key lengths really *is* a losing game.

The syllogism at the end of your post is exactly why I have spent the last more than 5 years negotiating and lobbying and why we (FI's) and you (everyone else) shouldn't worry about the impact of government policy on the security of financial communications.  Market (macro and microeconomics plays a bigger role than the government.
I wouldn't give up my citizenship,  neither would I join those guys at the Fort and give up my rights to move about the world without asking permission to travel or publish.  I like the balance where I am, but respect those who wish to protest peacefully.  I would prefer that folks kept us out of their fields of fire in the various skirmishes occuring during the cryptocrusades and left us to manage the policy for and the security of our space for ourselves and our customers.  just my personal views...kawika...

Frankly, I *really* have a hard time with all this
man-without-a-first-world-country, crypto-expat stuff. I think making the
technology not eonomically optional is the way to change things, and no
amount of romantic, jurisdiction-shopping "regulatory arbitrage" is going
to alter reality all that much.
But, I guess, Anguilla's as nice a place to have this affliction as any I can

And, I wish Vince -- and now, apparently, Ryan -- good luck, whatever happens.
Yet, for some reason, memories of Vietnam-era draft-dodgers keep coming to
mind. For what it cost them all personally, not much good came of it, I'd say,
for them or anyone else. The people who protested the war and "fought the good
fight" to end it stayed here to do it, after all. The most potent anti-war
activists were Vietnam vets themselves, for that matter. And, of course,
Ridgeway told Eisenhower at the outset that Vietnam was a multi-million-man
war, and Eisenhower stayed out accordingly, throwing a few marginal people on
the ground to shut Lodge up. It took Testosterone Jack to get a Special-Forces
hard-on. Eventually he and Desktop Lyndon ended up screwing a pooch
instead of the commies.
Do people out there really think somebody like Gore's going to do a
crypto-amnesty someday? I didn't think so. Ashcroft, maybe, but don't hold
your breath, there, either. It'll be decades, I bet, and our "boys over
there" will have grey hair long before they do come back home on this one.
Political inertia is probably going to keep a few people we know outside
the fence, looking in, for an awful long time after the issue's utterly
I expect people who do this crypto-expat stuff are going to get their
new passports refused at the U.S. border when they visit, and I think that
things are going to get worse for them for a long time before they get better.
Of course, there's a fair argument to be made that if they do get refused,
it's probably time to leave, anyway, but I'll let someone else gnaw that bone.
And, frankly, I *do* expect that the FBI will attempt domestic crypto
controls, just like they've been been trying to do for some time now. But,
unlike a lot of people, I think that the marketplace will steamroller all
such silliness into yet another roadtop attraction, before or after its

Financial cryptography is strong cryptography.
Therefore, if there's no strong cryptography, there's no digital commerce.
