@_subject: `Web of trust model' matches common business situation too 
Interestingly, I am coming to the conclusion that big business operates
on a web of trust very much like what is found in PGP.  There are
Dun&Bradstreet reports of course, but, bye-and-large, when a company
wants credit, they give a list of the other companies that they do
business with as evidence of their trustworthiness in receiving credit.

@_subject: dockmaster addresses 
I note that at least one of you (who won't say who he is) wondered about
communications from this address.  This address has one very appealing
feature to me, it is company independant; that is, if I should move
around, I get to keep the address.  I started this before the acm begain
their redirection effort, so now if you wish to reach me, you can email
to peace at acm.org.  That does sound much better doesn't it?
I must echo some other sentiments that I have heard from others around
here ..  an issue that gets lost a lot on the majority of internet lists
(including PEM-DEV) where company affiliation carries a very large
amount of baggage.  Namely
I am who I am, and that's all that I am.
I'm ..Peace ..Tom
