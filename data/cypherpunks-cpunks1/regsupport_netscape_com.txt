There are lots of open proxy servers, which will let you access
other sites by setting your web proxy to use them.
I don't have a list handy, but most search engines will make it easy
to look for them.  Also, does the proxy block the IP address, or only the domain name?
If it blocks by name, use the IP address.  If it blocks by IP address,
write the administrators of anonymizer.com to see if they've
got alternative IP addresses.
Also, see if your proxy blocks spaceproxy.com.

Meanwhile, the Bush and Gore campaigns are doing their own discussion on privacy policies, led by Markey, who thinks
that the Feds have a right to control what goes on Cable TV
because lots of people watch Public Television on cable,
(Goldsmith I don't know... Robbin, do you know him?)
and moderated by Etzioni, who doesn't believe your right to
privacy includes keeping the Feds from eavesdropping,
and invented "Fair Cryptography" to make it easier for them.
I seem to remember Etzioni being tied into the Communitarian
movement as well.
Much as I think the Naderites are wrong in their idea that
more government control can improve privacy,
this seems like a setup for a debate on
"Privacy - Threat or Menace"....

That's certainly a big part of it.
NSA has also always had the policy that they and only they will decide
what's strong enough for military use, partly because they
know what they (and possibly the KGB) can crack,
and they know that everything the commmercial world offered before DES,
and much of which it offered before PGP and before EFF's Deep Crack,
was either Snake Oil or DES implementations of varying quality
(e.g. some had inadequate random number generators for keys).
They also had a policy of not letting their crypto tech out,
because that would give the Commies technology as good as theirs,
which they desparately didn't want, and while security by obscurity
isn't real security, it still helps reduce attacks by less capable
cryptanalysts and makes data collection harder for the KGB,
or for other people they might want to hide stuff from,
like the Brits or French or Israelis.
