The Canadian Broadcasting corporation is running a segment on the 10pm news tomorrow on e-privacy. To the public's comments and suggestions on the issue they have created a discussion forum on thier web page.

A study by Canada's privacy commissioner reports that almost half of Canadians are perfectly comfortable with retailers compiling personal data...if there's a reward paid to the consumer. (Such as a discount or free goodies). Tell us what you think about e-privacy and who should know what about you.
