@_subject: FAQ? how to set up a cross-platform encrypted mailing list/forum 
Why not a web-based email/discussion forum over SSL?
Or does "encrypted traffic" mean you want it encrypted as it sits around
in various places, and not just while it's in-transit.

At CertCo we used a slightly modified version of the Umich BER decoder
can now be found within openldap.  I don't know how big it was, but it
into a Chrysalis card with a whole bunch of other certco firmware.

It sure looks like the Umich LDAP library is prior art which invalidates
most, if not all, of the independant claims.  (At least 1 and 6, which
are the key ones.)  This library was documented in RFC 1823, published
in August 1995.
