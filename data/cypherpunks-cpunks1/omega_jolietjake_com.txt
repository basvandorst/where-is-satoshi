   +I guess I don't understand the distinction you are trying to make,
   +between a  "popular anarchy" and an "anarchy."    Maybe you were trying
   +to distinguish  between "dictatorship of the few (or one)" and
   +"dictatorship of the many (perhaps a  majority)" but it didn't come out
   +very understandably.
   +Put simply, "anarchy is not the lack of order.  It is the lack of
   +_orders_."
       disagree. pure anarchy is not the lack of "orders" --pure anarchy        implies that everyone is imbued with that perfect sense of        responsibility.
   +>        anarchy is only possible in an ideal world where _everyone_    +>    assumes not only responsibility for themselves, but for the common    +>    good.  no malice, no greed, no need for assassination politics....
   +No, that's traditional thinking and that's wrong.  See AP part 8.    +Freud  believed (as "everyone" else believed, even myself, before AP)
   +that anarchy  was inherently unstable.  But it ISN'T, if the tools of
   +AP are used to  stabilize it.  And no, no altruism is necessary for AP
   +to work as well; no  individuals are being asked to sacrifice
   +themselves for the common good.    Rather, they are given the
   +opportunity to work to achieve a reward offered,  cumulatively, by a
   +number of citizens.
       aah, but that is the difference between a _pure_ anarchy and a         _popular_ anarchy.  A pure _anarchy_ is sufficiently idealistic in        that _noone_ lacks the necessary resonsibility to keep society        moving, each individual in their own niche.  As long as there is        perfect responsibility in a perfect anarchy, then there is no need        for AP.
       AP is a negative, or _punative_, influence; I might liken it to the        Catholic Church which is a religion of fear, and an instrument of
       political control.
