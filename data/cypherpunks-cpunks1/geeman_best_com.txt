@_subject: On computer face recognition: 
There was a piece, I _think_ in Scientific American, tho it might have been
an AI journal, on face recognition by use of neural nets together with what
were called "eigenface" images: These eigenfaces each have specific characteristics, which when combined
together can closely approximate a specific face image.  The target face was
analyzed in terms of closeness-of-match to a small set of eigenfaces, on the
order of 5 to 8, I think.  Results of course were promising (else why write
about it, eh?) if not excellent.

This is the language that Feinstein inserted into the Defense Authorization Act.  It has been passed by the Senate.  This is not
good, but significantly different from her first effort last Spring (a similar amendment, to the S.735 anti-terrorism bill of 1995). This
language is technology-neutral.  However, it does have a very slippery
'intent' or 'knowledge' standard, and though the language of the bill does not directly focus on the Internet, all of Feinstein's commentary on the Senate floor and to the press have focused exclusively on "bomb-making information" on the Internet.  Though this new version of her Net censorship proposal is possibly constitutional, unlike the earlier one, a key question that all constituents and journalists need to ask of Sen. Feinstein is: If you are simply trying to criminalize online incitement of, or conspiracy to commit, murder by bomb, then what on earth does this bill do?  Both of these things are *already illegal* online or offline.

This comes up once in a while --- it appears an inappropriate approach,

since the solution space for the problem consists of exactly one spike, in

more efficient

This argument would break down if there were detectable biases in the

Software that is imported becomes subject to ITAR with respect to
re-exportation, of course (but of course IANALetc.)  If you can't demonstrate to MSFT that you are
playing by the rules --such that you have the proper export papers
for your code if you plan to export it, for example-- they won't sign,
even if developed outside US.
So: you develop a CSP outside US ... you have to IMPORT it to get it signed.
It becomes subject at that point to ITAR export regs.  Unless you demonstrate
that you fulfull those requirements, no signature.  So there's no relief by
looking at just exporting the signature.

We have been trying to post this News Release to several          places in USENET, but are seemingly being thwarted by          person or persons unknown. Shortly after the posting, on          01-26-96, our postings were all methodically removed without

         Internet.Privacy.Guaranteed, IPG, today announced a new

         IPG Guarantees Absolute Privacy on Internet. Using the          trademark CRE transform, material, what do I get?
the IPG PCX Nvelopes system          translates any intelligble digitized information into
         random gibberish. function: does this make it secure?  Ridiculously not.
Only one other user, or more in certain          instances where there is a need to know,  will have the          Nvelopener required to transform the random gibberish back
         into intelligible digitized information. CRE Transforms,
         trademark IPG, are the only acknowledged unbreakable method
         of so transforming digitized information. information was given them about the implementation?  Who  is IDG, what are their bona-fides?  Did they
work for the Mossad once, per chance?  That's always a good line.....
There are no passwords,
         encryption keys, or anything like that to conjure up, remember,          and perhaps forget. PCX Nvelopes usage is automatic, similar          to PKZIPand PKUNZIP.   Easy to install, use, add to, and
         administer.
                        It is Unbreakable            If an individual, or any group of individuals, break the IPG
         Privacy System, IPG will sell them their company for $1.00,
         and even give them the dollar to buy it with. If you think you
         can, just try and find out that it is impossible. There may          be rumors that someone has broken the system, but that is not          possible, it will never happen.
                     Don't Waste your time !
         How dare IPG have the unmitigated gall? When you are certain,
         then you are certain, and IPG is certain! Others dare not
         make such a brazen boast because they cannot possibly back it
         up, but IPG most certainly can.  Every informed expert of the
         technology will confirm, without reservation, that the IPG
         system is not breakable, as many already have!  There, we
         have thrown down that gauntlet, dare you pick it up?  Be
         forewarned, if you do, in your quest, you will never become a
         knight; but instead, will only become utterly benighted.
                               CRE Transforms
         The system uses CRE transforms, called Nvelopes, to translate          any meaningful digitized information into random gibberish. In
         order to convert that random gibberish back into intelligible
         usable form, a Nvelopener is required, and only the recipient
         has the required Nvelopener.

There are remarkable similarities between this 'system' and the Elementrix

Or perhaps it's the other way around.
Both involve:
- An ill-defined cure-all solution which can't realy be revealed because of
patent-pending status
- An OTP (so they say) that's not really an OTP
- Starting with a 'seed' that is truly random and then algorithmically
generating a stream that is XOR-ed with the data, based on analogies to
"rotors" and "dice"
- Encrypting keystream data using portions of the previous keystream

  The June 10, 1996 Network World carried a story on page 8 under the
title "Microsoft breaks crypto barrier", which starts off as follows:
  " Microsoft Corp. last week said it will include cryptography-based
security technology in its operating systems, messaging product and
Web browser through a new set of APIs that will be available both in
the U.S. and overseas.
They said this quite some time ago!
  Later on, it says:
"  Microsoft's Crypto APIs will be available to third-party vendors
writing applications with embedded security. But the hardware or
software Crypto-engines for these applications will need to be
digitally signed by Microsoft before they will work with the APIs.
Under an unusual arrangement with the NSA, Microsoft will act as a
front man for the powerful U.S. spy agency, checking on whether the
vendors' products comply with U.S. export rules."
compliance is the developer's responsibility, and any notion that MSFT is going to front for NSA in somehow validating crypto code is ludicrous.  The signature function is so the OS can validate the code and make sure it's not been tampered with.  Period.  Excuse me, er, NW, how is MSFT going to sign hardware?  heheheheh.
  I was a bit surprised not to see any discussion of this here. Is it
just old news? Or maybe people here don't read Network World?

ok, last time:
the deal was that Microsoft got the permission to ship a generalized API if the crypto-engines
are signed to prevent code that conforms to export restrictions from being tampered with after the fact: hence the signing.  This prevents code that is conformant from being patched, e.g. to turn a 40-bit key parameter into a usable one.
Now I suppose it could be that there is a back-door deal that MSFT will provide to NSA info regarding the
originators of the engines, but let's have some evidence of it before yet another conspiracy rant, OK?

This is a very deft and sly move, if it was indeed planned, by the NSA.
Clearly they have got the message.  Political efforts to curtail crypto
are doomed to failure.  Economic strangulation is the way to go.
Well here you are folks, months of bitching about how stupid the NSA must
be has paid off.  Not only is this clever, its insidious.
1. It's too difficult for Joe Sixpack to understand.
2. It preys on the market leader already, rather than attempting to
bootstrap (as with clipper).
3. It uses as its implementation a private, rather than a public entity.
Now this strikes me as something truely frightening.  The NSA has become
an intelligence agency which is effectively working in concert with
private interests to conduct internal security operations by proxy.

Particularly impressive is that our key length report was hardly
above criticism from several angles, but their rebuttal managed
somehow to avoid them.
What I find most disturbing about this is that their report was
provided secretly to policymakers in the administration and in
Congress, without independent technical review that would have
quickly exposed the fallacy of the arguments.  I never would have
seen it had several of the recipients not faxed it to me.  This is
the first hard evidence I've seen of NSA providing anything less
than the highest quality technical analysis to other parts of the
government.  A non-specialist reader would be easily misled by the
technically dense, but completely irrelevant, "rebuttal".  It smacks
of either ill-informed sloppiness, or, perhaps worse, self-serving
disingenuous cynicism.  Either conclusion is scary, and, to me in

Many good cryptographic products are available, both commercial and free.  However there are also some extremely bad cryptographic

It is extremely important that users of cryptography actively

works.  If this appears to be confusing nonsesense, it may very well
be (even to someone familiar with the terminology).  Technobabble is
good means of confusing a potential user and masking the fact that
vendor doesn't understand anything either.
A sign of technobabble is a descrption which drops a lot of technical
terms for how the system works without actually explaining how it
* specially coined to sound as if they mean something
* used in a way that the profession generally doesn't do.
Check for other references to the "technologies" referred to, and if you find nothing in any literature (even by doing a not search) then you should be suspect.
Examples include:
New Type of Cryptography?
Avoid software which uses "proprietary" or "secret" algorithms.
Security through obscurity is not considered a safe means of
protecting your data.  If the vendor does not feel confident that the
method used can withstand years of scrutiny by the academic
neither should you.
Beware of specially modified versions of well-known algorithms.  This
may unintentionally weaken the cipher.
The use of a trusted algorithm, along with technical notes explaining
the implementation (if not availablity of the source code for the
product) are a sign of good faith on the part of the vendor that you
can take apart and test the implementation yourself.
Old Ciphers Never Die...
Some vendors will claim their software is "unbreakable".  This is
marketing hype, and a common sign of snake-oil. Avoid any vendor that
makes unrealistic claims.
No algorithm is unbreakable.  Even the best algorithms are breakable
using "brute force" (trying every possible key), but if the key size
is large enough, this is impractical even with vast amounts of
computing power.
Be wary of marketing gimmicks related to "if you can crack our
software" contests.
caveat-ed: Any such contest which seems to be OVERSTATED (e.g. "I'll give you the keys to the company ...") in relation to the size, maturity, and reputability of the offering entity (company or individual) is to be suspect.  Netscape offering tee-shirts and such for breaking a system is one thing.  Someone you have never heard of offering his entire company is something else.  I think there will necessarily be some fuzziness here.
A snake-oil vendor may claim the system uses a one-time-pad (OTP),
which, when implemented ABSOLUTELY CORRECTLY, is unbreakable.
A OTP system is not an algorithm.  It involves generating a random
at least the size of the message and garbling the message with it.
When the message is decrypted, the key is destroyed.  Only one
is encrypted with a OTP, and it is used only once.  They key is
random: generated using a real random source, such as specialized
hardware, radioctive decay timings, etc., and not from an algorithm
cipher.  Anything else is not a one-time-pad.
The vendor may [perhaps deliberately] confuse random session keys or initialization vectors
with OTPs.
property of (properly used) OTP's and try to call whatever it is he is offering an OTP.  Any variation from the fundamental rules of what an OTP is makes the claim bogus.  Any vendor who tries to pass off his invention as OTP when it is not has, by definition, reduced his credibility to dangerously low levels.
Algorithm or product XXX is insecure
The "key" and the "password" are often not the same thing.  The "key"
generally refers to the actual data used by the cipher algorithm.  The "password" refers to the word or phrase the user types in,
 which the software converts into the key (usually through a process
called "hashing" or "key initialization").
The reason this is done is because the characters a user is likely to
type in do not cover the full range of possible characters. (Such keys would be more redundant and easier for an attacker to gues
s.)  By hashing a key can be made from an arbitrary password that
covers the full range of possible keys.  It also allows one to use longer words, or phrases and whole sentences as a "passphrase", wh
ich is more secure.
Anything that restricts users passwords to something like 10 or 16 or
even 32 characters is foolish.  If the actual "password" is the cipher's key (rather than hashing it into a key, as explained abo
ve), avoid it.
Anything that claims to solve the "key management problem" is also
be to avoided.  (Key management is an inherent problem with crypto.)
Convenience is nice, but be wary of anything that sounds too easy
to use.  Avoid anything that lets anyone with your copy of the
software to access files, data, etc. without having to use some sort of key
or passphrase.
Avoid anything that doesn't let you generate your own keys (ie,
the vendor sends you a key in the mail).
Avoid anything by a vendor who does not seem to understand the
difference between public-key cryptography and private-key cryptography.
Lost keys and passwords
If the software is made in North America, can it be exported?  If the
answer is yes, chances are it's not very strong.  Strong cryptography
is considered munitions in terms of export from the United States,
requires approval from the State Department.  Chances are if the
software is exportable, the algorithm is weak or it is crackable (hence it was approved for export).
If the vendor is unaware of export restrictions, avoid the software:
the vendor is not familiar with the state of the art.
Because of export restrictions, some legitimate (not-Snake Oil)
products may have a freely exportable version for outside of the USA, which is different from a separate US/Canada-only distribution.

What about the heuristics of partitioning the keyspace?
Seems to me that a _subset_ of all possible keys is much more likely
to appear than a random selection from an equidistributed population 0..2^56.
(P)RNG's just aren't that likely to produce a key of 010101010.....
nor 001100110011... etc etc and I have been thinking about how one might formalize and exploit this randomness property to increase the probability of finding the key sooner.
So a keysearch strategy should be something other than a partitioning of 2^26 into N bins
with a linear search within each bin.  I realize that it is POSSIBLE that a key of 1010101010...
was used, (excluding weak keys from consideration) ---- but I have seen "certifiable" RNG's and,
God Bless 'em, they just dont ever produce anything with any predictability.  Is not the lack of predictability a predictable, and therefore exploitable, attribute?

The distributions are **not** uniform.
I am talking about FAMILIES of predictable bit patterns in keys, not any specific pattern.
I'm doing the stats.
The goal is to search the most likely keys first, and not all keys are created equally.
Your reasoning is thin.

Right.  A good CSPRNG is ulikely to produce the pattern 010101010101.
It's also unlikely to produce the pattern 0011001100110011.  Oh, and
it's also unlikely to produce 01100100101001011.  In fact, a good
32-bit CSPRNG has only a 1/2^32 chance of producing any particular
bit pattern.  Of course, another way of saying that is that it's just
as likely to get an "obvious" bit pattern as it is to get any other
one.  You can't just throw away part of the keyspace based on such
bogus reasoning.  (There may be other reasons to throw away part of
the keyspace, of course.)

: 	Re: DESCrack keyspace partitioning of course, any number in the range of a random number
generator is theoretically as likely/unlikely to appear.
however, consider the case in which DES keys are generated
from ascii sequences or words that people enter in at
password prompts, which is in fact how the unix passwd file
word. these obviously have far less randomness
and Gary's attempt to narrow the keyspace is highly also, I took his post as suggesting that some parts of the
keyspace ought to be searched at higher priority than
others. in the above example, keys that correspond to ascii sequences typable on a keyboard should be searched
first in the keyspace.
a lot of systems use DES only in conjuction with a one-time-key
generated for a particular message. (similar to the way
PGP uses IDEA for the session key, and transmits this encoded
key using RSA). in general I would say these could be considered
random in a way that the previous "less-than-random" property
doesn't hold.

@_subject: probability question for math-heads 
I'm too tired &/or busy to work this out, via Knuth --- maybe you can help, with some implications for the DES keysearch strategy.
What is the expected distribution, in a "random" binary sequence  -- with all the fuzziness that implies as to what _exactly_ is "random" -- of gaps between runs of same-bits. i.e. what is the expected distribution of sequence length between occurances of two (and only two) 1-bits in a row?  how about sequences of 3 1-bits?  ETc.
We know that in a _truly_ random sequence, taken over a long enough period, there should be all possible values of "gaps".  But what is
reasonable to expect in a "random" sequence as to how those gaps are distributed?  Is my question equivalent to Knuth's gap test?
If anyone feels like proffering some education on this, if I find anything useful in my investigations I'll certainly credit the help!
TIA, etc.  -- and hey: doesn't Nickelodeon have a trademark on GAK?

yes ... the more one looks at the "random sequence" question, the more
questions that arise!  Again, referring to Knuth ... anything that takes
as many pages in one of his books as "Definition of Random Sequence" does
is certainly nontrivial.
A "gap" in my current inquiry is the number of bit positions between occurrances
of a specific bit-pattern.  My current investigation uses same-bit repetitions (00, 11),
but of course that generalizes to any specific n-bit pattern (e.g. we should get
the same results **in a perfect random sequence** if we count gaps between the
pattern "11" or the pattern "01".
I'm going to have to chew on this .... but thanks for the Poisson hint.  Actually,
it looks like some graphs I've generated just might have some similarity to Poisson
distribution!!!  Bears more thought.

@_subject: [DES] Random vs Linear Keysearch. 
I still maintain (and I'm working on some proposals --- it just takes more time than I have to form them well) that there
are strategies for partitioning the keyspace that are likely to be more efficient, given how likely it is that the key is constructed/derived/etc., using certain common techniques.
Now, if there is **NO** information as to how the key is constructed/derived, then
all the assumptions about a perfectly distributed keyspace result in the
conclusions we are all familiar with.  But you know the adage --- smarter, not
harder, and all that.  There WILL (almost always) be knowledge of the key generation techniques.  It is unlikely that geiger counters are in use by the
banks.  **IFF** there is a-priori knowledge of the key gen techniques, then it should be used if possible.
Now, I happen to be working on ONE SPECIFIC and common generation technique,
and there is some reason to believe that when it is used there is a more
efficient approach to partitioning.
There are a lot of caveats here ... and don't overgeneralize what I'm after -

Avoid anything that lets anyone with your copy of the software to
     access files, data, etc. without having to use some sort of key or
     passphrase.
     Avoid anything that doesn't let you generate your own keys (ie, the
     vendor sends you a key in the mail, or it's embedded in the copy of      software you buy).
     Avoid anything by a vendor who does not seem to understand the
     difference between public-key (asymmetric) cryptography and      (symmetric) cryptography.
   * Lost keys and passwords
     If there's a third-party utility that can crack the software, avoid      If the vendor claims it can recover lost passwords (without using a
     key-backup or escrow feature), avoid it.
     If there is a key-backup or escrow feature, are you in control of the
     backup, or does the vendor or someone else hold a copy of the key?
   * Exportable from the USA
     If the software is made in North America, can it be exported? If the
     answer is yes, chances are it's not very strong. Strong cryptography      considered munitions in terms of export from the United States, and
     requires approval from the State Department. Chances are if the
     software is exportable, the algorithm is weak or it is crackable      it was approved for export).
     If the vendor is unaware of export restrictions, avoid the software:
     the vendor is not familiar with the state of the art.
     Because of export restrictions, some legitimate (not-Snake Oil)
     products may have a freely exportable version for outside of the USA,
     which is different from a separate US/Canada-only distribution. Also
     note that just because software has made it outside of North America
     does not mean that it is exportable: sometimes a utility will be
     illegally exported and posted on an overseas site.
Other Considerations
Interface isn't everything: user-friendliness is an important factor, but the product isn't secure then you're better off with something that is
secure (if not as easy to use).
No product is secure if it's not used properly. You can be the weakest link
in the chain if you use a product carelessly. Do not trust any product to foolproof, and be wary any product that claims it is.

TITLE:          SYMMETRIC-KEY CIPHERS BASED ON HARD PROBLEMS
A useful principle in cipher design is to reduce or at least relate
closely the cryptanalysis of the cipher to some long-studied problem
that is believed to be difficult.  Most public-key ciphers follow this
principle fairly closely (e.g., RSA is at least similar to factoring).
Modern symmetric-key ciphers, on the other hand, can rarely be reduced
in this way and so are frequently designed specifically to resist the
various known cryptanalytic attacks.  In this informal talk, we examine
a simple cipher primitive, based on Feistel networks, for which recovery
of its internal state given its inputs and outputs is NP-complete.  We
outline simple and efficient block- and stream- cipher constructions
based on this primitive.

One is the insistence of Government that the benefit of crypto to the Four
Horsewomen of the Infocalypse (Porn, Drug Dealing, Money Laundering, and
Terrorism), and the corresponding threat to society, is so large as to
warrant  registering everyone's secret-telling capability. The other is the
intrusion by Business and Employers into the habits of consumers and workers.
 From click-tracking on the Web to the recently reported monitoring of every
7-11 manager's move at the POS terminal, Business is no friend of the People.
 That this is perhaps the more insidious threat is manifest by your not even
mentioning it or including it in the question set.  I fear Businesses who say
"Government leave us alone because the Free Market knows what's best" and
then proceed to invade and intrude in ways that are equally damaging to the
privacy of the individual.  The philosophy that if Business invades privacy
it's OK, and if Government does so it's bad, is to say that 2+2=5.

I use anonymizing tools when I need to, to protect what I consider "things"

ownership of Gov't *by* Big Business. I see two equally onerous invasions:
One is the insistence of Government that the benefit of crypto to the Four
Horsewomen of the Infocalypse (Porn, Drug Dealing, Money Laundering, and
Terrorism), and the corresponding threat to society, is so large as to
warrant  registering everyone's secret-telling capability. The other is the
intrusion by Business and Employers into the habits of consumers and workers.
 From click-tracking on the Web to the recently reported monitoring of every
7-11 manager's move at the POS terminal, Business is no friend of the People.
 That this is perhaps the more insidious threat is manifest by your not even
mentioning it or including it in the question set.  I fear Businesses who say
"Government leave us alone because the Free Market knows what's best" and
then proceed to invade and intrude in ways that are equally damaging to the
privacy of the individual.  The philosophy that if Business invades privacy
it's OK, and if Government does so it's bad, is to say that 2+2=5.
I have been fairly careful and very jealous of my privacy; and then my name
and home address showed up on one of the name-search pages.  I don't know if
it's still there, and I don't remember the link.  But then the Similac
marketing Geniuses sent me something in the mail that even included the due
date of my expected child!  I consider that sensitive as hell, and it didn't
occur via the Web.  The problem is across the board.
I use anonymizing tools when I need to, to protect what I consider "things"
that are too sensitive for the Web.  I have looked up past friends on the
Web, and then not called because I felt it would be an intrusion into their
life.  I have found the ability to search for information on PUBLIC figures
important and useful, looking for items related to their professional
activities, and I think this is an important capability.  The opportunity for
People to make sure that the elected officials they elect and pay for, and
the businesses that pave their towns and dump toxics into their yards, are
behaving responsibly, is one of the few remaining possibilities for positive
change.  In the meantime, I'm wondering, as I wander off to renew my driver's license,
why they want my social security number.  And I still don't know how Similac figured out when my wife and I had sex.

yikes - this response makes me as nervous as any misguided government GAK
Yes, why *should* the poorest and most starved people in the world have any
more than they do? It's a free world, ain't it?  They're free to avail
themselves of the latest in technology, health care, and education to
improve their lot aren't they?  No, they're victims of transnational corporate wealth-displacement programs
funded by the IMF and World Bank, organizations which fatten tinpot
dicators' personal fortunes while forcing an export economy onto the weak,
stripping them of the power of self-sufficiency in order to feed corporate
Masters with no place and no conscience.
These people the ones who pick your fruit and vegetables; they're the ones
who make your designer sneakers and the silk ties and nice button-down
shirts you wear to your cubicle every day.  They're the ones who have no
voice, no power and no chance. They starve in order to feed and clothe and
entertain you, that's why. There are equitable balances of wealth distribution, and there are
unconscionable and indefensible ones.  I try to play a part is maintaining
a balance saner than that of a world dominated by people with your

my wife sponsors a child thru the Christian Childrens Fund; I try to
educate myself -- to learn why the peasants revolted in Chiapas, how GATT

The point was that Marc Andreessen insists on framing the crypto debate in
terms of "The Market" -- the next statement was that that's OK because What's Good
for the Market is Good for the People.  My reply to that was "bullshit and
here's why"; don't take my word for the stats, go look them up, and I won't
go into the absolute correctness of your statement about "wealth" vs.
"securities" Bottom line is that there is tremendous evidence that what's good for the
Market is NOT at ALL good for 'the people' -- and that framing the crypto
debate in such terms makes the issues of civil liberties and the
empowerment of People irrelevant.  Now this may be a good political ploy

The alternative solution might go something like this (also known as the
Mother of Clipper):
1. Outlaw use of any crypto not authorized and provided by an Official
Source, which is to be provided in the form of hardware on the
CPU/Motherboard (or equivalent, depending on the computing/communications
2. When you wish to send an encrypted communication or store encrypted
data, the Official Crypto Device from the Official Source first must obtain
a Secrecy Credential from a Central Repository, to which you have applied
for some strength crypto.  The Credential gives you certain secrecy
privileges ... as long as you're being a good citizen.  The Credential
enables the crypto on your official device: the device will not function
without communicating with the Central Repository and obtaining today's
3. When LEA wants to tap you, it sends a control message to the Central
Repository which modifies your Secrecy Credential, dumbing you down to,
say, 40bits. They could even provide the entire session key (or other
secret as required by protocols.)  As long as this state is in effect, your
"encrypted" communications and storage are readable by the LEA.
Now: consider the profits to be made by the Central Repository, which is
responsible for maintaining your Credential.  Each Credential use could be
charged a transaction fee, as well as the annual licensing.  The crypto
device provider has a locked-in market for its silicon, as it must go on
all the motherboards and into the CPU's.  The big-system manufacturers
responsible for the servers and communications required to manage the
communications between the crypto and repository make out real well too.
It sounds like a perfect fit for Microsoft, Intel, together with HP-s ICF!!

These evaluations are in percentage form. They represent the percentage
of time that the incumbent voted with that organization's preferred
positions on a number of
votes that they identified as key in their issue area. Remember, by
definition, these r
atings by special interest groups are biased. They do not represent a
non-partisan stance. In addition, some groups select votes that tend to
favor members of one political party over another, rather than selecting votes based
solely on
issue concerns. However, they can be invaluable in showing where an
incumbent has stood on a series of votes over a year's time, especially when ratings
by groups
on all sides of an issue are compared. Descriptions of the organizations
offering p
erformance evaluations are available. Project Vote Smart collects performance evaluations from ALL special
interest groups who provide them. If there is a group you that feel is missing from our
database, either they do not compile performance evaluations, they would
not allow Project Vote Smart to distribute them, or we are unaware of the fact
that the
group does ratings. Please let us know if you think we are missing a
group's ratings and we will contact the group immediately. A final note: The clearest way to read these percentages is, "In [year],
the X
YZ organization gave Senator/Representative X an 80% rating. That means
that on
votes they identified as key in their issue area during that time
period, he/she voted with the group's preferred position 80% of the time." The
exception to this is the
evaluation done by the National Taxpayers Union, which represents how
often a representative or senator voted to decrease, or not increase, spending.                                      Performance Evaluations by Special

I'm reading a book, "Who Will Tell the Truth" with some very clear insights
How it All Works.  The bottom line is the Bottom Line and the reason the
debate is going this way is due to exactly one thing: Money.
I know there are those amongst this readership who feel that there is no
place for the usual political process in dealing with the crypto issues, but
that's not a universal or a given, nor is it necessarily practical in the long
run.  But within the existing structure the missing component in the debate is
the active participation of a lot of dollars.
The weight of Micro$osft + Netscape + (name your favorite list) is
miniscule, and their players woefully inexperienced,
 compared to McDonnell D., G.E. Fed., TRW., Lock/Martin, IBM, and others who
stand to gain hugely from a Federally-mandated and controlled PKI.  Those
heavyweights are all drinking buddies with the  other Washington sorts who
are in search of ever-expanding missions in life, and the result is a coterie who's primary
isn't even remotely concerned with Child Pornography, Money Laundering, etc.
but their own aggrandizement measured in personal and corporate dollars.
There are no doubt massive investments being made by Industry in the conservative thinktanks
who produce the
intellectual fodder-de-jour that supports the position of this elite, and
overwhelm the
likes of McCain and Kerrey with
impossible-for-the-legislature-to-understand managed "information" which boils it all down to the 4 Horsemen arguments.

  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, last week the Senate Commerce Committee reported a bill, S. 909, sponsored by Senators McCain and Kerrey, which largely embodies the latest administration proposals to deal with encryption technology. This misguided legislation (S. 909) would be a great leap backward in the effort to reform current American export restrictions on encryption and remove serious impediments to the competitiveness of our Nation's high-tech industry.
  In addition, by proposing unprecedented domestic controls on the use of encryption, the McCain-Kerrey bill also poses serious threats to fundamental civil liberties and privacy rights. I believe that the Senate effort is propelled largely by a lack of understanding of both the worldwide prevalence of strong encryption and the technical challenges posed by the massive key recovery-escrow infrastructure envisioned in the bill.
  Earlier this week, Mr. Dan Gillmore, columnist for the San Jose Mercury News discussed the problems with S. 909 and strongly urged a rejection of the McCain-Kerrey approach. I submit his column into the Congressional Record.
            [From the San Jose Mercury News, June 23, 1997]
          Encryption Bill: Federal Exercise in Self-Deception
                            (By Dan Gillmor)
       As a bill bearing his name zipped last week through the      Senate Commerce Committee he heads, Arizona Republican John      McCain said, ``This bill carefully seeks to balance the      concerns of law enforcement with individual privacy      concerns.''
       The legislation, co-sponsored by Nebraska Democrat Bob      Kerrey and two other Democrats, was the latest futile attempt      in Congress to achieve the impossible: compromise on an issue      that fundamentally has no middle ground.
       The issue is encryption, the scrambling of digital      information. Try as they might, lawmakers must eventually      understand the reality. When it comes to the privacy of      personal information in the digital age, we have two simple      choices. Either we allow people to encrypt their messages,      using scrambling and unscrambling ``keys'' to which only they      have access, or we do not.
       Governments are certain that bad people will use encryption      to help achieve bad ends. They're right. But their cure would      shred our basic liberties.
       So the Clinton administration and its allies--the McCain-
     Kerrey legislation is widely viewed as an administration-
     approved plan--are pushing a policy that would force us to      put descrambling keys in the hands of third parties. Then,      when law enforcement people wanted to see our communications,      they'd simply get the keys from that third party.
       The McCain-Kerrey bill pretends to stop short of that. It      would force government agencies to use only electronic      hardware and software that included this key-recovery scheme.      It would also require the same system for anyone using a      network that is funded in any way by federal funds, including      virtually all university networks.
       While one section calls the system ``voluntary'' for      private individuals, the rest of the legislation would make      it all but impossible to resist. Hardware and software      companies, which so far have resisted the government's moves,      will be much more likely to simply give in and build this      key-recovery method into all of their products if they have      to build it into ones bought by the government. Consumers      need options, not monolithic products.
       Another section of the bill would, in effect, require even      private citizens to use such software--and therefore give      their keys to the third parties--if they want to buy anything      online. People tend to use what they have in front of them.
       There's nothing wrong with the idea of letting a third      party hold onto a descrambling key in certain cases. As      former White House official Jock Gill noted recently on an      Internet mailing list, all government communications should      use such a system so the public can keep an eye on what the      government is doing in our name and with our money. We'll      need to create a system, of course, where such oversight      doesn't end up forcing the public to use exactly the same      technology for its own encryption needs--or at least keep      private keys out of the hands of centralized third parties.
       Companies, meanwhile, will need to hold onto the business-
     related keys of employees, so that vital records won't be      lost when someone leaves or dies. But I can't think of many      companies that will be happy about giving the vault keys to      third parties they can't control.
       Private citizens also should consider giving their keys to      trusted third parties, just as they give their house keys to      neighbors when on vacation trips. I intend to do just that--
     but it's none of the government's business who gets my      personal encryption key. I need strong encryption, as the      digital age arrives, because more and more of my life will      exist on these public networks.
       The practical difficulties of setting up a centralized key-
     recovery system are immense. Even if it could be done, I      would never trust such a government-run system to be even      remotely secure from corruption. I remember the Social      Security employees who sold personal information to      outsiders. I've also seen too much evidence that governments      tend to abuse liberties when they have too much power--and      the McCain-Kerrey bill would allow virtually anyone at any      level of law enforcement to have access to private      information on the flimsiest pretext, not even requiring a      court order.
       Kerrey's participation in this latest travesty is sad. He      needs no lessons in courage. He lost part of a leg in      Vietnam. Later, as he stood up to the know-nothings who would      ban flag-burning, he noted that our strength comes partly      from our ability to express ourselves even in ways that      offend many others.
       Now, however, Kerrey is aligning himself with a much more      dangerous crowd of know-nothings: those who'd ban our right      to keep private information private. He may believe this is      about finding common ground; if so, someone has fed him      falsehoods. His proposal, if enacted, would create the worst      invasion of our fundamental liberty in many decades.
       If you care even slightly about your privacy in the future,      pick up a pen today and write your Senators and member of the      House of Representatives. Tell them to reject the Clinton-
     McCain-Kerrey approach. Tell them you value your privacy and      won't give it up without a fight. And remind them that you      vote.

My biggest problem is when the pundits (and by extension, those that punt
to them)
frame this entire debate in terms of the Market.  To do so is to argue that
only solutions
that are good for The Market are good solutions; that when a particular
policy is market-agnostic
or market-negative, even though it may be good policy for People (yes,
remember them ???) it is irrelevant or
bad.  This debate is NOT about the Worldwide Encryption Market!

@_subject: [PGP-USERS] Crypto-logic US$1 million Challenge 
There was a Snake-oil FAQ floating around for quite a while that addressed
all this
in some detail.
This scheme/scam has circulated before, too although I forget the name of
the perpetrating company.
product of this nature, they charge $49 for the "OTP's" (I'll get to the
OTP's later)!!!
communicating with requires a separate "OTP". The program comes with 2
"OTP's" and additional "OTP's" can be purchased for $49. So say you have 10
people you wish to communicate with you are talking almost $500 out the
gate to get going!!! This is just silly.
made of. Here is how their sales pitch works (and i have seen many of them
over the years):
understand what a OTP is and how it works.
fancy here. To encrypt a message one takes the bits in the plaintext and an
equal amount of bits from the OTP and XOR them together. The result is just
another random file of bits. To get the plaintext back one takes the
"encrypted" files and Xor's it with the same bits used the first time.
"random" data you are dead in the water. The biggest flaw in products that
claim to use OTP's is they use what is called a PRNG (pseudo random number
generator). Unfortunately the data that PRNG's produce are not sufficiently
"random" for use in OTP's. It has long been accepted in the field of
cryptology that you *MUST* use a real world sample for random data, things
like measuring the time intervals between click on a Geiger counter
measuring background radiation.
as this seems (after all this is why they call it an One Time Pad) there
are programmers out there that fail to grasp this basic concept. Now AFAIK
there is no pad reuse with this program. That's where their revenue stream
is comming from charging you for the new pads!
an OTP encrypted message is provably unbreakable.
program uses an OTP only too see that they are using a PRNG to generate
their "OTP". I even had one claim that it was ok to reuse his PRNG
generated pad.
who knows what they are doing.
comes to generating and using OTP's then yes the message is unbreakable.
the company!! This means that a 3rd party outside of you and the person you
are communicating with has a copy of the pad!!! This is a big no-no in
cryptology. Anyone who has access to the OTP can decrypt any message that
was encrypted using it. What type of security do they have on site? Who has
access to the OTP's?? How are they generated?? What are their policies if
the government requests access to these OTP's?? All questions left
unanswered by the company.
considering how the initial OTP's are sent to the customer, (drum roll
please), the just MAIL them!!!!
in cryptology. How do you get the keys to the people who need them to
decrypt the message??? With OTP's or any form of cryptology where the same
key is used to encrypt and decrypt the message the user must find a
"secure" channel for exchanging the keys. This is no different than a key
to a house or a car, the same key is used to lock and unlock the door.
Anyone who has a copy of the key can unlock the door. Need less to say you
don't just send the key in the mail. Usually such exchanges are done in
person or if this is not practical a "trusted" courier is used to exchange
the key. Not very practical for every day use.
There are may other programs that provide overall better security than what
this program ever can or ever will provide.
who can better expand on this issue.
