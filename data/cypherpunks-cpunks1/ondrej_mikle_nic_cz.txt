@_subject: [cryptography] really sub-CAs for MitM deep packet inspectors? 
This thread is amazing. I've known just a fractions/hints of the practices
described here. Few comments/questions inline/below.
How do MitM boxes react when they MitM connection to a server with self-signed
cert (or cert issued by an obsure CA not trusted by MitM box)? Do the boxes send
to client also an auto-generated self-signed cert that generates warning or
"re-sign" it so that client sees valid chain?
MitM-re-signing an unverifiable chain of server to a chain that's trusted at the
MitM-ed client would be hilarious, allowing to MitM a MitM box (though this
would be an easily avoidable mistake to make).
Given the state of security/auditing of "private sub-CAs" as described, was
there ever a report of a breach (e.g. stolen key, fraudulently issued certs)?
While chasing data from my scans around, I checked history of few CAs. Most
oddly hilarious "trusted" CA is probably SAIC (Science Applications
International Corporation). Reason: SAIC led the development of Trailblazer
Project for NSA (in my book this tops much-too-obvious CAs of other TLA agencies).
Also, Network Solutions, L.L.C (also a CA) was owned by SAIC at some time.
Later, Network Solutions did not acquire exactly "good guy" reputation.
Don't get me wrong: I'm not claiming either of the mentioned CAs did anything
egregious subverting CA-trust placed in them. I have no intention to single them
out as "shady", additional search would turn up many more CAs.
Hypothetical question: assume enough people get educated how to spot the MitM
box at work/airport/hotel. Let's say few of them post the MitM chains publicly
which point to a big issuing CA. It was said (by Peter I think) that nothing
would likely happen to big issuing CAs (too-big-to-fail). Would the MitM-ing
sub-CAs take the fall? (lose license and invested funds)
