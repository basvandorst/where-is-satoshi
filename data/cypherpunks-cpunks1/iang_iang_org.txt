@_subject: [p2p-hackers] Whistle-blower site platform design 
If I think of the 3 whistleblower cases I'm mildly familiar with, there is no commonality between the source protection aspects.  I think this might be something where whatever technical system you put in place, a wise whistleblower would not be keen to trust it.  Given that the typical cost of being a whistleblower is probably minimum loss of income for years, and loss of liberty likely, it might be a really high target.
If that view holds, it might be better kicked out of any technical design for a publishing system.
OTOH, If you wanted to make source protection strong *and* technical (e.g., uploading), then you might want to make it the same system for both uploading and downloading.  Hiding the source in a crowd of downloaders is one benefit, and making the download protection high profile may help to make the overall source/sink protection better.
4.  Gatekeeper role.  It would seem that any pure technical system could be flooded by junk.  Typically a team is needed to analyse, filter, edit and approve.
Some thoughts!

:)  Maybe to add to your surprise, there was a serious history!  Perhaps a little more background will help.
In the late 1980s, a guy called David Chaum invented a cryptographic form of cash which he called digital cash.  His invention was a variation of the RSA formula that allowed a transfer of something from one person to another, that a third party could prove as valid, but not track the transfer.  This allowed the third party to be an issuer of value, and users to transfer coins without being traced.
David was a privacy guy and worked out somehow that the future of the planet depended on robust but private exchange of goods for cash.  He saw the bank and the government as the greatest threats to people in their breach of privacy.  The basic threat is that if the crooks, governments or banks know where the value is, they won't be able to keep their hands off it for long.
David started a company called DigiCash in Amsterdam which built a system of digital cash (of course) and then in around 1994 he started trying to sell it to banks as the latest hot Internet invention.  From a PR point of view, he succeeded dramatically;  more was written about the invention of digital cash than practically any other thing with perhaps the sole exception of Netscape.
Which intersected with a large community of anarchists / libertarians / privacy nuts called the cypherpunks.  So around 1995 there was an explosion of interest in money systems, wherein money was seen as the solution to every problem.  This interest rumbled on, with hundreds of startups taking on different perspectives until 2 events knocked the fun out of the game (2000 dotcom crash and 911).
Now, just about that time, as the money business was being rewired in some post-fun image by dotbomb+911, Napster started up and showed a new model.  So a natural shift occurred as people started looking at the p2p market as the solution space.
MN was one of those.  The thing to understand though is that the people in MN all came from the earlier generation.  Zooko worked for DigiCash and Jim was a cypherpunk, I guess.  Well, we all were in some sense, I was too.
So, that generation saw money as the solution.  This generation sees p2p collaboration as the solution.  Who's right?  Who's wrong?
It all depends on your assumptions.  Economics will tell you that the money guys are right if there is a scarce resource, and/or the resource is worth real value.  But, if not, then collaboration can be done if we can find the sweet spot.  Now, it's rather difficult to predict how any particular problem plays out, but it is somewhat easier to say this:  if the system is valuable, it will eventually have value.  To steal.  And if not, maybe we're wasting our time?
So, in such a system, money might solve the accounting of trades of value, but that's not a guarantee -- money is very tricky stuff to get right, and there is plenty of merit in leaving that part to the end. Which is kind of what Jim was getting at:  MN tried to solve too much. Out of it came some successes, but they were cut-down, like BitTorrent and Tahoe.  As time goes on, more value finds its way into these successes, and the call to add in a money gets louder.
Caveat:  I was an observer of those efforts, of the things mentioned above, so corrections from the insiders can be expected!

One could say that, as an emerging force eating away at the web.
The problem is a layering one.  TCP/IP was a fabulously successful product but is now showing the end-of-life blues.
As p2p apps have discovered, the proper software engineering is to bypass the TCP/IP + TLS + HTTP bloat completely and develop a custom UDP security protocol.  This is relatively easy to do, and I would argue this results in better performance (at all levels including human coding costs) than trying to improve TCP/IP/S.
At some stage, those with browser and server access [0] trying to improve the HTTPS experience are going to realise that what is needed is a complete bypass.  They'll hack up a secure datagram mode in the server, and get Chrome or IE to flip across to it by means of some trick in DNS or HTTP headers.
Hopefully they'll do it correctly, and eliminate all the pointless negotiation about security policy in TLS.  It's all on, all the time. There is only one mode, and it is secure :P  One True Cipher Suite!
 From what I've seen when I've done this, resiliance goes up an order of magnitude, and speed for ordinary stuff doubles [1].

I believe it is germane to anyone designing crypto protocols to understand how they actually impact in user-land.  This particular one is a running sore for me because of its outrageous claim of deniability.
The *claim made by OTR is to provide technological deniability* as opposed to any non-technological status.  Its non-technical deniability is zilch.
Unfortunately, outside the technology, it is trivial to prove the logs as authentic.  This is confusing for the technologists as they are trying to create a perfect security product, and they believe that technology rules.  What they've failed to realise is that real life provides some trivial bypasses, and in this situation, they may very well be creating more harm

@_subject: [cryptography] OTR and deniability 
Back in the 1980s, a little thing called public key cryptography gave  birth to a metaphor called the "digital signature" which some smart  cryptographers thought to be a technological analogue of the human  manuscript act of signing.
It wasn't, but this didn't stop the world spending vast sums to experiment with it.  They still are, in Europe.  Oh well, that would have been OK as long as it didn't hurt anyone.
But it gets worse.  Those same cryptographic dreamers theorised that  because their mathematics was so damn elegant, the maths couldn't lie. So, they could promote a "non-repudiable signature" as a technological advance over ink & quill.  The maths was undeniable, right?  Although these days we know better, that "non-repudiation" is a crock, we still have people running around promoting it, and old text books suggesting it as an important cryptographic feature.
Repudiation is a legal right, it's a valuable option within dispute  resolution, not a mathematical variable to solve out of the equation.
You can't mathematise away legal rights, any more than you can democratise poverty away in the middle east, nor militarise pleasure away in a random war on drugs.
OTR makes the same error.  It takes a very interesting mathematical  property, and extend it into the hard human world, as if the words carry  the same meaning.  Perhaps, once upon a time, in some TV court room drama, someone got away with lying about a document?  From this, OTR suggests that mathematics can help you deny a transcript?  It can't.  It can certainly muddy the waters, it can certainly give you enough rope to hang yourself, but what it can't do is give some veneer of "it didn't happen."  Not in court, not in the hard world of humans.
I am reminded of a film _A few good men_ which is somewhat apropos of  those two young kids wasting away in some afghan shithole that passes for military justice.  It's that well known scene where Cruise traps Nickolson in to undenying his repudiation:
   Kaffee: *Did you order the Code Red* ?
   Col. Jessep: *Youre Goddamn right I did* !
That's repudiation, real life version.  And that's what happens to it, as summed up by Kafee afterwards:  "the witness has rights..." Mathematics has no place there, as is shown by all the other muddy evidence in the case.

@_subject: [cryptography] OTR and deniability 
(I suspect a confusion here.  A plaintext is a document, whereas "he said, she said" is witnessed or hearsay.  They have wildly different effects in court, under interrogation.)
Actually, I suspect not.  I humbly submit to the court that a plaintext  document plus the presence of OTR is somewhat less deniable than a  plaintext document by itself, which are both less deniable than a  non-existing document.
Perhaps we could lump this under the law of unexpected consequences?
Part of the problem I have semantically with OTR is that it isn't OTR. The presence of a record means it is on the record.  While OTR-the-product might be attempting to decrease the tamper-resistance qualities of the document, there is manifestly a document.  And such presence tends to outweigh in real life any advantage gained by tampering.
If it was truly OTR, it would turn off the record.  That's what it means, the tape stops rolling, the typist stops typing.
Probably we can't achieve precisly that, within the context of p2p  communications without TCBs.  But we can come close.  There are  possibilities:  Counterparties can contract to delete the record  afterwards, exposing themselves to civil claims if this is not done.  Further, it might be possible to make declarations under penalties of  perjury that the record has been deleted.  Or, we could IPR it, or even  invoke DMCA over it, and have the OTR application do the deed under a  technological protection.
I'm not suggesting that this be done;  just that it seems to be evident  that OTR doesn't take much in the way of steps to take something "off the record."  What it does achieve, IMHO, is make it easier for a court to rule against a false repudiation.  This is hard to see as an advantage to the users, who might be tempted to talk as if they can later deny the conversation.  E.g., wikipedia, that notably deniable authority, says:
"The primary motivation behind the protocol was providing deniability for the conversation participants while keeping conversations confidential, like a private conversation in real life, or off the record in journalism iang, the other other one

@_subject: [cryptography] bitcoin scalability to high transaction rates 
The question is whether it is even close.  It's pretty clear it can never be stable enough to be a currency.  Pretty much all currencies lean on some form of stability;  BitCoin does not, and suggests "when it's big enough, supply v. demand will stabilise it..."
Only gold/silver has ever pulled off that trick, and emulating gold is not what you'd call a winning strategy.  Actually there's a name for it:  alchemy.  BitCoin is cryptographic alchemy.
Sure, and those things have rules too.  Local currency is local; BitCoin is not.  The difference is that in local currencies we can rely on the trust and reputation networks to stop people stealing.  In BitCoin, we can't.  In local currencies, when the currency moves outside the very tight trust circle where everyone knows each other, they fail, because someone moves into the currency who has no reputation to lose.
(Alternative currency is just a term used by the regulated currency  people, it doesn't really tell us anything.)
Not really.  It's problem isn't its mathematics or its release rate, but  that it has no ground to stand on.  Which is to say, if people want to bid it to the sky, they can.  If people want to dump it to the bottom of the ocean, they can too...
With a currency that is backed on something stable, the stable commodity  forms an anchor around which value gyrates.  So, it is worth holding if  the price goes up too low, because you can always use it for its stable  thing.  E.g., in US of A, the american people are quite happy to hold $$$ because they can pay their taxes with it.  They really don't care that much what the exchange rate is doing, up or down.  This anchor means USD is a good currency.
Possibly what people don't realise is that it is very easy to corner a  market.  However, the fundamental value of the unit (the commodity) will  stabilise and punish the speculator who corners the market.  With BitCoin there is no underlying anchor to punish the person cornering the market, so the games will be excessive, and volatility will be too high to be PS: having said all that negative stuff, I quite like BitCoin.  If it got the econ right, we'd be having different conversations :)

A requirement for a bubble would be a promise of ever-growing value, the  rest is just the marketing.
Yes, this is what I mean by the obsession against government monies, which makes people vulnerable to putting their value into alternate currencies.  Their desire to thumb their nose against the government outweights their desire to manage value wisely.  To the extent that people put their funtime income into this, it's the same as movies, gambling, porn.  Fine, but some people will inevitably invest their fortunes in it...
What is most extraordinary about the current thing -- and what tends to  confirm "bubble" to me -- is that the same people who were desperate for  the privacy promise of blinded bearer coins are projecting their old  privacy beliefs on the nymous BitCoin:
The biggest drive towards the use of Bitcoins on sites like Silk Road is  that they supposedly cannot be traced [1]. However, a member of the  Bitcoin core development team told Gawker that "...because all Bitcoin  transactions are recorded in a public log, though the identities of all  the parties are anonymous, law enforcement could use sophisticated network analysis techniques to parse the transaction flow and track down  individual Bitcoin users."
Such a comparison was denied vociferously in bearer days.  Blinded  transactions were the only way to do it, and the nymous architecture now  seen in BitCoin was considered evil because the issuer could supposedly  see "all".
Worse than a private nymous system, this one is public?!  What could be  easier to datamine than a public database?  Give me a public database and a handful of subpoenas, and this thing goes down.
[1] Note confused terms there.  BitCoin can be traced, but the holders  aren't identified.  This is called "nymous" in the trade.  In contrast,  bearer coins could not be traced, but typically the holders had identified accounts.  "Untraceable."  One system achieves privacy through a perpetual public key account mechanism, the other through an untraceable transfer between known persons.  You can take these axes and combine them to create 4 spaces if you desire...

The best way to think of this is from the marketing concepts of "product  diffusion" or "product life cycle".
The challenge for the new product is to migrate from left to center to  right of that graph in above link.  In doing so, the newer groups come to dominate the earlier groups, and the earlier groups typically fall away.
Recall the video story?  The innovators got in very early, and bought  Betamax because it was better quality.  But they got stuck when the market was captured by the VHS system.  So lesson  is that early groups are risking punishment.  Same story for DVD.
Also, the backroom story for video was that the porn films, the big market that lifted the revenues of the distribution chains, and made it  worthwhile.  These products/people/chains kept the industry alive while it built up steam for the mainstream.  Lesson  -- you need these strange uncomfortable groups to get to where you want to get.
Later on, as more mainstream comes into play, these strange uncomfortable groups can be eased out.  Or they go somewhere else, or we change our minds about them.  We also write them out of history...
So, as far as recreational pharma product is concerned, this is typical of these things (if that is what it is).  E.g., SSL certificates early  revenue was also porn, Paypal had some dodgy customers, and for e-gold, it was ponzis / games that pushed the business into the black.
The challenge is what to do next, how to grow up.  This is going to be  practically impossible for BitCoin because it has no guiding hand like  e.g., Paypal had.  It's only got the invisible hand, which suits the  innovators fine ... but it also means it hasn't got much of a chance of  going mainstream.

It depends on what the intention or objective of the attack is.  And that depends on the threat actor.
For example, a phishing threat actor would be looking to steal money.  Whereas the state actor would be looking to figure out who is doing what, to attack out of band.  A competitor would look to attack the reputation, by e.g., disruption to reliability or mud flinging.  A retailer / consumer would look to dump liability.  Insiders would look to extract rents.
Each of these interests from diverse parties result in different  attractivenesses to different threat scenarios, many of them uncorrelated.  Some of the scenarios and assets can be protected ("mitigated") by tech/crypto, but typically most cannot, and require non-tech mitigations.
To go any distance on this, you'd rapidly end up doing a major risk  analysis, a lot of work.
The alternative is to start from the classical CIA, etc.  The problem with that is it that it is someone else's threat model, not yours.  You really don't want to discover who that someone is after you've built your system, it'll so ruin your appetite.

@_subject: [cryptography] Is BitCoin a triple entry system? 
Yes, so back to crypto, or at least financial cryptography.
The accounting layer in a money system implemented in financial  cryptography is responsible for reliably [1] holding and reporting the  numbers for every transaction and producing an overall balance sheet of an It is in this that BitCoin may have its greatest impact -- it may have  shown the first successful widescale test of triple entry [2].
Triple entry is a simple idea, albeit revolutionary to accounting.  A  triple entry transaction is a 3 party one, in which Alice pays Bob and  Ivan intermediates.  Each holds the transaction, making for triple copies.
To make a transaction, Alice signs over a payment instruction to Bob with her public-key-based signature [3].  Ivan the issuer then packages the payment request into a receipt, and that receipt becomes the transaction.
This transaction is digitally signed by multiple parties, including at  least one independent party [4].  It then becomes a powerful evidence of  the transaction [5].
The final receipt *is the entry*.  Then, the *collection of signed  receipts* becomes the accounts, in accounting terms.  Which collection  replaces ones system of double entry bookkeeping, because the single  digitally signed receipt is a better evidence than the two entries that  make up the transaction, and the collection of signed receipts is a better record than the entire chart of accounts [6].
A slight diversion to classical bookkeeping, as replacing double entry  bookkeeping is a revolutionary idea.  Double entry has been the bedrock of corporate accounting for around 700 years, since documentation by a  Venetian Friar named Luca Pacioli.  The reason is important, very  important, and may resonate with cryptographers, so let's digress to there.
Double entry achieves the remarkable trick of separating out mishaps from frauds.  The problem with single entry (what people do when making lists of numbers and adding them up) is that the person can leave off a number, and no-one is the wiser [7].  We can't show the person as either a bad bookkeeper or as a fraudulent bookkeeper.  This achilles heel of primitive accounting meant that the bookkeeping limited the business to the size with which it could maintain honest bookkeepers.
Where, honest bookkeepers equals family members.  All others, typically,  stole the boss's money.  (Family members did too, but at least for the  good of the family.)  So until the 1300s and 1400s, most all businesses  were either crown-owned, in which case the monarch lopped off the head of any doubtful bookkeeper, *or* were family businesses.
The widespread adoption of double-entry through the Italian trading ports led to the growth of business beyond the limits of family.  Double entry therefore was the keystone to the enterprise, it was what created the explosion of trading power of the city states in now-Italy [8].
Back to triple entry.  The digitally signed receipt dominates the two  entries of double entry because it is exportable, independently  verifiable, and far easier for computers to work with.  Double entry  requires a single site to verify presence and preserve resiliance, the  signed receipt does not.
There is only one area where a signed receipt falls short of complete  evidence and that is when a digital piece of evidence can be lost.  For  this reason, all three of Alice, Bob and Ivan keep hold of a copy.  All  three combined have the incentive to preserve it;  the three will police  each other.
Back to BitCoin.  BitCoin achieves the issuer part by creating a  distributed and published database over clients that conspire to record  the transactions reliably.  The idea of publishing the repository to make it honest was initially explored in Todd Boyle's netledger design.
We each independently converged on the concept of triple entry.  I believe that is because it is the optimal way to make digital value work on the net;  even when Nakomoto set such hard requirements as no centralised issuer, he still seems to have ended up at the same point: Alice, Bob and something I'll call Ivan-Borg holding single, replicated copies of the cryptographically sealed transaction.
With that foundation, we can trade.
In 2005, the SEC looked at my triple entry implementation, and....
...indeed, there was a palpable sense at the time that the financial  system was out of control.  They were looking at this thing with worried  It's an open question as to whether triple entry in any of its variants  (Todd Boyle's, mine or Satoshi's designs) would have changed things for  the financial crisis of 2007 +/-.  I think the answer is;  it was way too late to effect it.  But, it wouldn't have hurt, and with other things added in [9], the sum would have changed things, assuming widespread But (a) the list of needed innovations is not trivial, and all are opposed by the financial institutions for the obvious reason.
Also, (b) it has to be said that at the bottom of the financial crisis is securitization, which changes everything about finance [10].  And I do mean everything :)  Without understanding the role that securitization plays, talking about triple entry or toxic assets or ratings agencies or bad behaviour or poor people or whatever is pretty much doomed to irrelevance.

Right.  Or more particularly, he asked:
    "... I canbt help wondering why
    Bitcoins arenbt unregistered securities."
And the answer is that the registrar of securities defines what the  securites are, and the SEC's definition is a long way away from BitCoin.
    "Uh-oh?  Maybe someone will be hearing from the SEC?"
No, that's not how the SEC works.  The SEC is a responding organisation.  They only deal when there is a complaint.  Even when there is a complaint, they will try their best to ignore it.  C.f, Madoff, which was dealing in If there is an interest, it will come from UST, via USSS.
Nod. A security is a contract where something is secured by one party to  the benefit of another.  We're missing the three components here, so where do we start?  Who's going to complain and what's their complaint?

I don't think there is any doubt that people can die because of breached  communications.  No need to look at the Iranians, just look at the US CIA, and the intel feeding into drones.
The question of causality is one that is very difficult to determine,  absent some pattern revealed by WikiLeaks (who have been accused as well).
However causality is also very important.  Without some historical pattern of facts, we're all speculating to a greater or lesser degree. How confident are we of that?
This is a sadly inaccurate statement.  Most people working actively and  aggressively against unconstrained governments know diddly squat about  tech.  The communities have frequent roll-over, frequent recruitment. The techies working with them are under considerable pressure to deliver, and often make basic mistakes.
Yes, definately.  Open question:  did the 9/11 guys use HTTPS?  Or just  HTTP?  I'm still searching for a case where it makes a clear difference.
(Their main counter-intel coup was to understand that the threat model  better than their enemy.  Their technique was to open an ordinary Yahoo  style account, share the account, then open up a draft email, and share  that!  Never send it, just edit and delete, over and over.  The NSA which were presumably hoovering all sent emails ... never saw a thing.)

How's BitCoin doing?
I saw two issues, being the lack of a substantial grounding in contractual valuation (design issue), and the rather dodgy hackability of the software (implementation issue).  In the event, these two conspired to cause volatility that makes the big markets look like a calm sea...  Fun to watch and play, not recommended to invest :P

On the crypto topic that everyone loves to hate, Bitcoin, the expected  attack has begun.
Philipp Guering and I wrote a paper that explains how this will fall out.
Although in the big picture, this is more about finance not cryptography, there is an engaging question - can cryptography be used to control this sort of issue?  It didn't work for Bitcoin, but more judicious uses of crypto can do a lot better, and has done with other designs.  The challenge is to get the balance right.

So, step into NSA's shoes.  If there is a timeline here we (NSA) worked  out we can break AES "soon" ... what would we do?
Would we impress everyone in the world as to how strong it was and push  NIST to standardise it as much as possible?  Plausible given that everyone follows NIST's lead without question.  The Suite B sweetener is aptly named, nobody seems to have missed the sour taste of Suite A ;-)
Would we propose or advance some modes or protocols above others?
Where I'm getting at here is things like CTR mode.  It seems that this  mode reduces the obfuscations of CBC to make AES the sole and only fulcrum of strength.  Nice, clear and simple.  But, assuming a predictable counter, we have lots of ciphertext with a clear relationship.  So CTR is easier to crack assuming a big machine that makes the local county brown-out every time someone wants to read a conversation.
Or, is the advantage that CBC and other modes have - obfuscation of the  ciphertext with variation stolen from the plaintext - of such low value in the scheme of things that these things make no difference?  Is the choice of mode irrelevant if AES has a weakness?
(context here is that I am examining an older protocol of mine with  thought of replacing it, and wonder which mode to prefer...)
(thinking about it more, my normal rule of "ignore the NSA always" should answer this :) )

He means Chaumian blinding protocol for transferring a single IOU from  Alice to Bob.  A Chaum blinded transfer ensures that the issuer Ivan  cannot trace the transfer from Alice to Bob, in this case it gives  untraceability (as opposed to anonymity or psuedonymity).

That's the point :)  As a slice of experience, this business of creating  new monies demands an integrity to economics that is uncompromising.  Whatever your views, you will find them challenged.  The more you know,  the better you'll be.  If you don't have a total commitment to the reality of people's financial habits, and a total commitment to being totally wrong from time to time, you'll find this business an unhappy one.
You are asking people to choose your form of money over others, and your  customers will be incisive and brutal with your chosen set of  presumptions.  Another thing you will need is a thick skin;  the ability  to debate the real issues while not getting distracted by the sink into  politics and verbal tit-for-tat.
Back in the good ol' days, Zooko and I used to run something called the  Weber Economics Club.  Every week we would collect all the local monetary engineers and discuss one economics topic of interest.  I remember Coase's theorem one week, Schelling points another week.  For an hour ... and then the beer would steer us to other topics.  Which is probably good, as our group was filled with randians and marxists alike, and we wanted to survive the night.
We should have produced a poster, something like
"Beer - helping Randoids and Commies debate economics since 1862!"

In a project similar to Wikileaks, ICIJ comments on tools it used to  secure its team-based project work:
"ICIJbs team of 86 investigative journalists from 46 countries represents one of the biggest cross-border investigative partnerships in journalism history. Unique digital systems supported private document and information sharing, as well as collaborative research. These included a message center hosted in Europe and a U.S.-based secure online search system.  Team members also used a secure, private online bulletin board system to share stories and tips."
"The project teambs attempts to use encrypted e-mail systems such as PGP (bPretty Good Privacyb) were abandoned because of complexity and unreliability that slowed down information sharing. Studies have shown that police and government agents b and even terrorists b also struggle to use secure e-mail systems effectively.  Other complex cryptographic systems popular with computer hackers were not considered for the same reasons.  While many team members had sophisticated computer knowledge and could use such tools well, many more did not."

Seems like.
However, the barrier for that seems somewhat higher than an intercept or  pen register.  (Entering into full speculation mode here) I suspect that  one would need a direct court order akin to a full search & seizure in  order to give the feds access to the messages;  it seems to involve  handing over the entire device key to clone the full personality.

Yes, now.
I suspect going back say 20 years, pre-net, it wasn't so obvious, because the dependency on open nets just didn't exist.  See comment below about AT&T & IBM.  In those days, networking was telco business, a mentality which just happened to align nicely with control mentalities, which suited both swings of the pendulum.
Right -- but it can answer the question to a sufficient degree given an  absence of interference in what is the right answer.  I posit.  C.f, Skype.
Delicious Irony!  Clearly my opinion is rather fruitloopy, but this  'conspiracy theory' is enacted in law -- crypto is officially a munition.  It's the job description of the agency of topic, which probably employs more computing security people than any other place. It's not as if Louis Freeh went to congress in the 1990s and said "Senators, I wish to engage you in a conspiracy!" although we might grant the DEA would wish it so.
What is perhaps controversial and maybe ridiculous is me saying that it  worked.  The NSA succeeded in created a drag on internet security  sufficient to explain the general failure -- the house of cards, as you  put it.
OTOH, if they hadn't achieved that drag, was taxpayers' money really being used wisely?  What are all these security people doing, then? Another irony

I think we all suffer a fair amount of cognitive dissonance on this one.
We all know stories.  DES is now revealed as interfered with, yet for  decades we told each other it was just parity bits.  The same process  happened to GSM -- MiBs specified the 40 bit key, but because it was a  secret design, they didn't need to create a legend to hide the 16 bits of zeroes.  Add in export control regs, add in the war against PRZ.
If someone where to do a longitudinal study of the public knowledge of the interference, I think it would mount up.  Individually, we can ignore those stories as conspiracy theory, but in aggregate, much harder.
This is the good news.  I think the message has finally got through that  usability is more important than classical CIA, etc.
Yeah.  This is a mystery to me, where did this crap come from?  Although  it aligns perfectly with the geek mentality, other specialties in CS tend to create a greater resistance to the guild mentality.  I can't pin the causality on it as yet.
A great read!
An interference attack can be extremely high-leverage.  Being good at it  can do a lot of damage.  This however doesn't mean that one is any good at cryptography mailing list

That's what we all believed.  From Wikipedia (I haven't checked the  primary references):
In contrast, a declassified NSA book on cryptologic history states:
In 1973 NBS solicited private industry for a data encryption standard (DES). The first offerings were disappointing, so NSA began working on its own algorithm. Then Howard Rosenblum, deputy director for research and engineering, discovered that Walter Tuchman of IBM was working on a modification to Lucifer for general use. NSA gave Tuchman a clearance and brought him in to work jointly with the Agency on his Lucifer NSA worked closely with IBM to strengthen the algorithm against all except brute force attacks and to strengthen substitution tables, called S-boxes. Conversely, NSA tried to convince IBM to reduce the length of the key from 64 to 48 bits. Ultimately they compromised on a 56-bit key.[9]
Conclusion?  We wuz tricked!  In their own words, they managed the entire process, and succeeded in convincing everyone that they did not.  And they made it weaker where they held the advantage:  budget to crunch.  Last two sentences, above.
Indeed.  Notice the subtlety of their attack:  it is brutally simple. We others focus on elegance, and dismiss the simplistic.
Cognitive dissonance?
They focussed on mission, and used asymmetry of crunch strength.  Recall  that, in the old days, no other country could muster the budget and  technology that they could.
Possibly.  In terms of algorithms, I don't think there has been a case  where they've deliberately weakened the algorithm.  OTOH, in terms of key strength, they have been very very finessed.  Remember Skipjack? The comments at the time was that the key strength was beautifully aligned - right at the edge.  80 bit keys where the open community had already concluded 128 was the target.  Which meant that if there was to be an advantage, all that was left was:  budget in crunching.

@_subject: [cryptography] an untraceability extension to Bitcoin using a 
Steve Bellovin posted this on another list, hattip to him.
    For those who just want the TL;DR, here it is:
Zerocoin is a new cryptographic extension to Bitcoin that (if adopted) would bring true cryptographic anonymity to Bitcoin. It works at the protocol level and doesn't require new trusted parties or services. With some engineering, it might (someday) turn Bitcoin into a completely untraceable, anonymous electronic currency.
(iang adds:)
Bitcoin is psuedonymous but traceable, which is to say that all  transactions are traceable from identity to identity, but those identities are psuedonyms, being (hashes of) public keys.  This is pretty weak.  In contrast, Chaumian blinding was untraceable but typically identified according to an issuer's regime.  Because Chaumian mathematics required a mint, this devolved to trusted/identified, so again not as strong as some Bitcoin fixed this 'flaw' by decorporating the mint into an algorithm.  This suggests a new axis of distributed.  But  Bitcoin lost the  untraceability in the process, thus rendering it a rather ridiculous  attempt at privacy, as the entire graph was on display.  Bitcoin is more  or less worse at privacy than Chaumian cash ever was.
The holy grail in Chaumian times was untraceable & unidentifiable, to  which Bitcoin added distributed.  This paper by Miers, Garman, Green &  Rubin suggests untraceable & psuedonymous & distributed is possible:

@_subject: [cryptography] "Meet the groundbreaking new encryption app set 
When we [0] were building the original Hushmail applet, we knew the flaw - the company could switch the applet on the customer.  The response to that was to publish the applet, and then the customer could check the applet wasn't switched.
Now, you can look at this two ways:  one is that it isn't perfect as  nobody would bother to check their applet.  Another is that it isn't  perfect but it was a whole lot better than futzing around with OpenPGP  keys and manual decrypting.  And it was the latter 'risk' view that won,  Hushmail filled that niche between the hard core pgp community, and the  people who did business and needed an easy tool.
This is also the same thing that is the achilles heel of Skype.  It turns out (rumour has it) that the attack kit for Skype that circulated in the late 00s amongst the TLAs was simply a PC breach kit that captured the Skype externals - keystrokes, voice, screen etc.  Once the TLAs had that, they were happy and they shut up.  It was easier for them to breach the PC, slip in the wrapper tacker, and listen in than seriously hack the skype model.  And, then, media perception that Skype was unhackable worked again, everyone was happy.
Same will be true of Silent Circle, and they will already know this (note that I have nothing to do with them, I just read the model like anyone else).  The security requirement here is that they don't need it to be completely unbreakable, they just have to push 99% of the attacks onto the next easy thing -- the phone itself.  Security is lowest common  denominator, not highest uncommon numerator.  See below.
FWIW, their security model looks pretty damn good, in that it is nicely  balanced to their business model (the only metric that matters) and they  trialled this through several iterations (ZRTP, I think).  They are the  right team.  Even their business customer looks fantastic (hints abound).  If you're looking for an investment tip, this wouldn't be so far off ;)
Don't be suspicious, be curious -- this is where security is at. Remember:  The threat is always on the node, it is never on the wire.
Looking back at that Hushmail app, another anecdote.  When I was doing  business with a guy who was security paranoid, he used an unpublished nym, encrypted his messages with PGP, and then sent them via Hushmail to me.  Life then turned aggressive, and we ended up in court.  His side demanded discovery.  I took all his untraceable, pgp-encrypted and  Hushmail-protected mails and filed them in as cleartext discovery, as I  was severely told to do by the court.  Oops.  From there they entered into the transcript as evidence, and from there, others were able to acquire the roadmap via subpoena.
The threat is always on the node.  Never the wire.
Your node, your partners node, your partner's friend's node ....  It is  this that the Mission Impossible deletion feature is aimed at, and it is  this real world node threat that it viably addresses.  This is what people want.  The fact that it is theoretically imperfect doesn't make it Nah, this again is the wrong approach.  Instead think of it this way: of 100 human rights reporters, if 99 are protected by this tool, and one  dies, that is probably a positive.  If 100 human rights reporters are  scared away by media geeks that say it is unlikely to be perfect, and  instead they use gmail, and 99 are caught (remember Petreus) then this is probably a negative.
Human rights reporters already put their life on the line.  Your mission  is not to protect their life absolutely, as if we are analysing the need  for a neighbour's swimming pool fence, but to make their reporting more  efficient.  Which coincidentally also means raising the chances that they live to report the next one.
Risks, not absolutes.

@_subject: [cryptography] "Zero knowledge" as a term for end-to-end 
Not without some precedent, there was a company called Zero Knowledge  Systems back in the early 2000s that tried to build what we now would see as a Skype or Tor competitor.
AFAIK, the term 'least authority' as used by Tahoe-LAFS folks does not  refer to 'zero knowledge' as per cryptographic protocols, but to the  concept of least authority as derived from the 'capabilities' school of  security thought.  This school has it in short that once one agent has  authority over some object (data perhaps) then there is no economic model available to us to stop that agent from sharing the authority (by accident or intent) and thus breaching security.  Given this 'truth', it derives that the best strategy for security is to reduce the amount of authority in many and serious ways.
As a technical paradigm, the capabilities school models everything more or less in the same way as OO programming.  Every active thing is an object, and references (called capabilities) are passed around carefully.  I think this fits precisely with what Tahoe-LAFS tries to do (although I'm writing from osmosis not real knowledge).  It seems from a quick browser that SpiderOak use the same design?
Although there are parallels, I don't think it helpful to interchange the terms 'least authority' and 'zero knowledge' in more technical  conversations.  They operate at different layers or levels, and achieve  rather different things.
That said, in the world of marketing, it is far more appropriate to tell  the customer something they understand.  Least authority isn't meaningful to the end-user;  zero knowledge does come much closer to what grandma can conceive of.
