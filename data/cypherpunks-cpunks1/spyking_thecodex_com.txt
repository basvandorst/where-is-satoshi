@_subject: Best Computer School? 
This is a little off topic but maybe someone can help. I've got a teenage
son (HS sophomore) who's interested in majoring in computer science in
college with a particular interest in cryptography. He's leaning toward MIT.
Any suggestions from list members as to colleges to investigate?
