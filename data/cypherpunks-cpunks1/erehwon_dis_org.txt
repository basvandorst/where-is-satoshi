@_subject: Computer design flaw opens airports to terrorism 
NEW YORK (Reuters) [2.9.98] - The computer security systems that control access to 40 airports worldwide through electronic
badges have a design flaw that could make them vulnerable to terrorism, the New York Times reported Sunday.
California computer security consulting firm, MSB Associates, found the flaw in December in a routine audit of a large California financial services software company, the identity of which was not disclosed, according to the newspaper.
Government buildings, including that of the CIA, and prisons
and industries with sensitive military, drug or financial
information or material also use the system and are also
vulnerable to attack, the Times report said.
American and British aviation officials have notified airports of the flaw, the Times said.  The system, introduced several years ago by a small company, Receptors, Inc., of Torrance, CA., relies on a secure, isolated computer in a guarded room to control door-locks and an inventory of electronic badges, the Times reported.
The company found, however, that in some cases an individual could dial in to the computer and create security badges and unlock doors.  Receptors' equipment was removed from the House of Representatives after the Inspector General found that 757 former employees appeared on the rolls of active employees and had working badges that would have allowed them access to the House buildings, the Times said.
Receptors' chief operating officer Dale Williams said that the problem is not with the system but with the way it was installed in some cases.  Some systems were connected to networks instead of being accessible only by a modem that would only be turned on when a Receptor employee performed maintenance, Williams told the Times.
Testing the system, MSB found that the problem persisted as late as last week in the company they audited, the Times said.  MSB created a fictitious employee, Millard Fillmore, which the company spotted on its rolls and removed. However, even after he was removed, the faux former president was still able to gain access to the company buildings, meaning any dismissed employee
would have the same access, the Times said.

Well as far as countries that have governments that don't really
exist there is always Liberia, But I personally would like my
own militia included with their business development package.
If I remember Black Unicorn's posts some months back about the
Seychelles, The Rene government will protect you from extradition
from any country with their military for what? $6 million?
Anguilla seems to be a doing agood job on becoming a country
willing on hosting data havens.
And there are likely under a hundred oil companies looking for firms to 'recycle' their old oil platforms and drilling
rigs wasting away around the world, I'm sure some might just
give you one just to be rid of future liability.

I'm working on a web page that would include a list of Internet

I have been able to put together, I'm wondering if there are

If memory serves me right it was because Vince bounced off the Taxbomber
site because it offered second passports, camouflage passports, and other
products that was considered a fraud, Which to me sounds odd since there
is some other company selling most everthing and then some from an .ai
domain which Vince's company has the monopoly on handing out .ai domains
You also have to wonder how far in the future it will be before the
special forces of some banana republic drops in on Vince to blow-up
his operation for as he advertises publishing censored information on ones ex-president on the Internet, or for that matter I have
yet to see abortion information coming from his servers. What has happened in Anguilla proves that there will be a need for different flavors of datahavens, Different degrees libility that
datahaven owners will want to store information on their servers.  I would love to open a XXX WWW site in Anguilla pulling in the industry average of $5-10K a month and not pay any taxes there, But it won't happen in Anguilla with the present adminstration!
Isn't there a microstate off the coast of England called 'Sealand' run
from a former oil rig/gun battery for the last 20 years?  I agree completely, But there is still room for massively distrubted
datahavens on oil rigs, barges, gun batteries, island nations or
hiding in Norm's LAN in Cicero IL.  All the harder to supress that

@_subject: Former US spy ship now a tourist attraction 
TOKYO (Reuters) [1.26.98] North Korea has turned the Pueblo, a U.S. navy intelligence ship captured 30 years ago, into a tourist attraction to attract badly needed foreign exchange, a Japanese scholar said Monday.
Shinobu Oe, professor emeritus of contemporary history at Ibaraki University, told Reuters he visited the North Korean port of Wonsan, where the vessel is docked, on October 29.
"As far as I know the North Koreans have been showing the ship to Japanese tourists since August," Oe said. "They tell tourists it's the Pueblo."
The capture of the Pueblo and its crew by North Korean patrol boats off Wonsan in January 1968 held the administration of then-U.S. President Lyndon Johnson at bay for months.
Japan's Asahi newspaper Monday published a photograph Oe took of the ship, which showed it bristling with antennae and wires. The professor said he could only view the ship from the dock.
"It sure looks like the Pueblo," said a U.S. embassy naval attache in Tokyo who saw the photograph.
Oe said North Koreans at the port gave no information about the ship or how it had been used for the past 30 years.
Attracting foreign currency has become increasingly important to North Korea after years of economic decline and failed harvests that have left the isolated Stalinist nation struggling to feed its people.
The standoff prompted by Pyongyang's seizure of the Pueblo 30 years ago led to a U.S. state of naval alert rivalling the Cuban missile crisis in 1963.
The crew was finally released in December 1968, but the ship stayed in North Korean hands.
Pyongyang portrayed the incident as a huge blow to the prestige of the U.S. superpower, which was then in the throes of the controversial Vietnam War.
