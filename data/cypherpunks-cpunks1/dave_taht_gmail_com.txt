@_subject: [Freedombox-discuss] bufferbloat, cerowrt and freedombox 
I am curious if the wifi blob problem in the dreamplug has been
resolved? It was runnerup  for bufferbloat's cerowrt research
effort, but that blob knocked it out of the running last year.
Failing that, is there another hardware device on the freedombox list
that has a decent (fully open source) dual channel wifi radio on it?
I'd give a lot to be working in a less constrained environment.
Other notes:
There's been some progress of late on fixing bufferbloat (which among
other things, is important for vpns to work well on low bandwidth
links), and I'd like folk to be aware of and applying some of the new
techniques to other related projects, see 'byte queue limits' in the
upcoming mainline kernel.

After living in Nicaragua for a few years, I tend to think also that
bandwidth management is important to your overall effort, and I'm
curious if you've taken a hard look at that? in my own experiments
with the previous openrd, it worked a lot better if you could set the
tx queue rings down below 20, from the default, and BQL promises
