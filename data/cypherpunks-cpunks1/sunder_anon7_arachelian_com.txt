So in Choate Prime, in order that one make a movie of a person getting

So in Choate Prime, in order that one make a Godzilla stomps on Tokyo

So in Choate Prime, are there no cartoons because it would be impossible

Porn is speech, the same as any other type of magazine, movie, sound, etc.
The acts can and have been faked, as are the sound effects.
The speech part isn't irrelevant, it's the whole, and only point of this
Yes, I know you'd bring up kiddy porn, but recall that not only movies of
such acts are banned, but so are cartoons, comic books, etc. depicting
such acts.  In other words, here in the real world (i.e. not in Choate
Prime), kiddy porn is thought crime, and thus it is restricted speech.
So is going on Yahoo stock message boards and getting people to buy stocks
so as to raise their price.
So are sexual offers/requests in the office.
I'm sure in your next elequent reply you will continue to tell us about
your lovely world in its parallel dimension, which has no relation to
ours, and we'll read it with fascination.

It was indeed very sureal.  Everyone was calm and quiet, no crazy panicked
mobs, just orderly, slow, methodical evacuation...  Of course the first
thing to go was cell phones, just from the sheer volume.  I did manage one
or two calls to loved ones.
There was a smaller queue of people in Radio Shack snapping up every
single radio they could find...  others were going to grocery stores to
get water and food, still others went to bars.  It was so fucking surreal,
I guess the shock of what happened hasn't sunk in my head yet, but I just
can't stop watching CNN.  I was listening to the radio all day, hoping for
more bits of truth....
I was in the subway at the time it happened, going downtown.  The train
stopped and got turned around.  I had no idea of what had happened.  When
the conductor announced that we were going back to 14th street, of course
we asked questions, we were told "Go home, be happy you're alive!"
Being in a shitty economy like this, I was seriously worried about being
late due to another subway fuckup...  I just barely got a job after three
months of being weaned off the .com nipple...  I didn't realize the
severity of it, until I got above ground and saw the huge plume of smoke
and the missing WTC towers...
When I got out, people were just walking around aimlessly, then eventually
they started heading north.  I ran across a Radio Shack and managed to
pick up a small shortwave so I could find out what had happened.
I walked, and walked and walked, people saw I had a radio and asked what I
heared, and I stopped at places turning it up letting them hear the news.  Of course some of the glory sucking weasels on 770AM(?) WOR would try to
twist things to make themselves look good.  Some asshole reporter/dj/etc named "Ed" was dropping that he'd been in
Vietnam, and how this is a tragedy, how he knew all along that Bush was
going to go to the SAC base in Alabama(???) though he earlier said he
thought Bush would go to a mil location in Fl, just being an annoying
prick and not getting the news out but rather basking in the tragedy of it
What pisses me off is that these fuckers managed to hiijack four planes by
using nothing but knives.  How the fuck could a bunch of guys do
that?  Nobody fought back?  Nobody charged at them?
And the silliest of all things, now, they will heighten security
further.  Great.  Didn't work before, certainly didn't work today.  How do
they expect metal detectors, silly questions such as "has your luggage
been in your sight all day long", and id checks to prevent attacks like
this propagated by suicidal religeous fanatical assholes?
If they had any sense, they'd have everyone on the plane carry guns.  The
second anyone tried anything, everyone would be able to stop them in
This attack was possibly the biggest "hack" of the century.  The bastards
lost very little.  Used our own resources against us.  Very effective.  I'm very outraged at this - a bunch of guys with knives did this!
I hope Bush has the balls to nuke'em back to the stone age!
This is amazing.  The NSA spends, what, $4.5 billion of our tax dollars a
year?  The CIA $2B?  With all that surveilance, with all that heigtened
security at airports, with all that sigintel and humintel, a bunch of rag
heads with knives managed this!
Why do these fuckers have a salary?
Go ahead, turn the USA into fucking Cold War era Russia.  Put face
scanners everywhere.  Give everyone travel visas to just pass from one
town to another.  Put metal detectors up our asses.  Go ahead.   But don't tell me you could have prevented something like this by doing
so.  Don't tell me your future lockdowns, curfrews, heigtened security
checks, road blocks, id checks, or any of that would have, could have, or
ever will prevent this sort of attack.
Admit the truth oh dear government.  You're useless.  Sure, bring in the
reserves, bring in the troops.  All you can do with them is clean up the
debris.  Go ahead put destroyers in the east and hudson river.  Fly F14's
around Manhattan.  It's still already too late for those that perished in
WTC 1,2, and 7.  It's not like the ragheads are likely to come flying migs
to NYC and shoot missles or come by boat - if they had such resources at
their disposal, they wouldn't have done it this way.
Had you allowed us citizens concealed carry guns through airports, had
even a small percentage of those on the downed airplanes carried guns,
this would have never happened.  But no, instead of arming us, you make us
weaker, disarm us further and further, so that we can be even more
vulnerable.  You stupid fucking morons!  What a waste!
Hope someone got a clue from this, but I doubt it.  Hope the Echelon
engines pick this up, and someone, somewhere, with a bit of sense will
wake up and get a clue.  Don't disarm America!  Let us arm ourselves.  Do
it for the children we will be able to protect from these nuts!  Yes, you, Jeff Gordon, trolling for bits of info to find someone to drag
into the courts for your perverse pleasure, you can make a real difference
instead of wasting our money on mock trials of defenseless lunatics who
write stupid manifestos.  Suggest this to your handlers.  Let us arm
ourselves.  Let us defend our country against these suicidal insane And yes, that concludes my $0.02 of bitching and ranting.  Sorry.  I had
to vent.

Fuck you and get a clue.  You're assuming that 90% of the population is
irresponsible for itself.  Today, I know for a fact that we are good,
honest, law abiding folk.  No doubt, no ifs, no buts.  I didn't see
looting, I didn't see insanity, I didn't see a single soul that did not
try and help his fellow exodee (if you would allow me the lattitude in
inventing the word.)
In fact, most people are not going to go around killing each other.  Even
if they could.  Most people are going to help each other.
Have you ever thought it out for a second past the media bullshit you'v
been spoon fed about how guns are evil?  They're not evil, they're
tools.  They're equalizers.  They make the smallest pipsqueak equal to the
tallest muscular bad ass out there.   And that in itself is why we need
them.  Two factors: a) 90+% of the population isn't interested in hurting
others.  B) when those that would pop out from under their rocks, they
would be surrounded by those who would put them out of everyone's misery
without the slightest hesitation.
Yes, and didn't you stop to think for a second that if a single terrorist
had a gun, but he was surrounded by fifty others against him with guns
that he would not survive?  Even if he were suicidal?
Think for a second.  Yes, he could put his gun to the head of a child next
to him, and quite likely suceede in murdering that child.  But he would
not be able to achieve any goals whatsoever.  HE would be shot down
instantly without mercy.
A terrorist's goal is a simple one.  TO force others to his will.  If he
knows he will die and is willing to die, he will do this gladly as we saw
today.  But if he knows that he will die and not achive his goals, if the
price is one terrorist's life for that of an innocent versus eight
terrorists for the price of 20,000, he wouldn't even attempt such a thing.
I'm 100% positive that a single armed terrorist with the best training in
the world would perish within seconds at the hands of 50+ such businessmen
before taking out more than several victims.  To understand this, you must
think as they did.
They suceeded in sacrificing eight of their lives on two planes - or so
the reports say 3-4 ragheads per plan with sharp implements managed to
raze at least three buildings.  I don't know how many died, but they said
that over 10,000 people worked at EACH of those buildings.  I hope most of
them managed to get out.
Back to the point: the bastards did the math just as well.  Eight of their
lives for 20,000 of ours.  If everyone had guns, even if the terrorists
also had guns, 4 guys in a plan of 120 would not have been able to force
the plane to become a bomb.  Simple, cold, math.  You can add, can't you?
Bullshit, they had knives and sharp instruments.  No matter how well
trained a killer is, he is no match for odds like 120 to 4 against.
Yes, I grant you, of those 120, many would have died.  But not thousands.
And why the fuck not.  Guns again are equalizers,  They make the weakest
of us into an equal of the strongest of them.
No, not everyone.  But that would have saved 20,000 lives at a cost of
perhaps three or four innocents.
Look in the mirror.  Learn the math.  Learn the crime statistics of those
cities and states that outright ban guns versus those that don't. Then
perhaps you can remove your socialist gun-paranoid foot from that hole you
utter words with.

No shit Sherlock, when did that dawn upon you?  But hey, guess
what?  When you go to driving school, you have nice stickers on the car
that say "Student Driver" and you have an instructor (car master?) who has
a second brake incase you fuck up so you can learn.
But once you leave the driving school and have your license, you're in the
real world.  You don't have the student driver stickers, nor the "car
master" next to you.
In an airplane with 3-4 terrorists, you'd presumably be one passenger of
120.  If even 5% of the passengers had guns, none would have to reload.  I
highly doubt that they would need a weapons master to tell them how to
hold a gun.  I certainly think that most people would be glad they were
alive and unhurt thanks to said gun carriers, and would mind the ringing
in their ears far less than being dead.
And certainly assuming most guns have at least 6 shots, multiplied by 6
people (that's 5% of 120 people) would give you 36 shots to put 4 assholes
out of everyone's misery, I don't think you have to worry about reloading.
You have very little to add to this conversation Mr. Anti Gun.

They were right.  The plane was effectively a missle, and come to think of
it not a bomb.  Bomb is something that isn't launched, it's carried or
dropped.  A missle is launched, it flies.  Like the planes.
Yes, of course plane!=missle, but in this case, it effectively was.
Granted, there will almost always be a witness that will say it was aliens
from the 8th dimention too...

In this case, I don't think anyone will complain very loudly.  In this
case, for once, the NSA would be right, and it wouldn't just be FUD.

I'd still fucking rush them if I had been there.  If anything it would
wake everyone else up to do the same.

So fucking what?  I'm sure he also uses toilet paper and soap, cellphones,

heaven forbid should anyone else be allowed to lest they be likened to a
Oh, you mean like Hiroshima or Nagasaki?  Oh well, let's just shit on
Uncle Sam for inventing the nuclear weapons before Germany could.  Nah, we
should have idly stood by while Germany built their own nukes, that way
you couldn't blame "our technology"
I think at this time, and I don't speak for most people - I'm simply using
my own views and extrapolating, that most people are glad they are alive
and breathing.  Most people are pissed and want retaliation.  Most people
aren't thinking "Hmmm, maybe I shouldn't use crypto, the telephone, mp3's
or the radio because they can also be used by terrorists."
Hey two way radios, cell phones, pen and paper, ink, cutlery can be used
against freedom.  Do you see Gerber, the knife makers volutarily going out
of business?  Or whatever company made the plastic knives used in this
attack because they were used by terroists?
Did Ryder, the company whose moving van McVeigh used to bomb OKC shut down
because their "technology" could be used by terrorists?
Get a fucking clue you troll!
Perhaps, but I think terror is the ultimate goal, not a supression of
freedom.  Fear, uncertainty and doubt, not a loss of freedom are the aims
of terrorists.  After all if they were worried about freedom being such an
important thing, their countries would have freedom, rather than the
extreme religeous bans.
DMCA and SSSCA have to do with mp3's and videos. Not crypto.  Now I'm
100% certain that you are a troll sent to demoralize this list against
cryptology.  Go fuck yourself.
Ok Mr. Troll, go and dig out the proof that said terrorists were
cypherpunks.  Go and dig out the proof that Diffie, Hellman, Rivest,
Shamir, Adelman, Schneier, and Zimmerman were on those planes holding
plastic knives.  Fucking troll!  If anything, you have a lot more in common with those
responsible for this atrocy than you do with any freedom loving citizen of
the USA.  Or for that matter any cypherpunk.
This was an attack against our liberty.  Against our freedom.  Perpetrated
by those who hate liberty and would love to enslave their countries under
severe religious laws.  They hate us most of all because they believe our
freedom is what makes us "The Great Satan"
And you sir, are spewing the very same agenda they are.  I suggest you
turn yourself in to the FBI this moment for the terror monger that you
