@_subject: NSA and the exchanges 
Anyone knows if there's a way to find out how involved NSA monitors 151 front street at Toronto?  NSA allegedly monitors data centres in the US, but does it have the same influence at a building sitting in its neighbor's soil?
There's something on the web like  that tries to piece it together.  but not sure how helpful the information on there really is?
feedback welcome.
