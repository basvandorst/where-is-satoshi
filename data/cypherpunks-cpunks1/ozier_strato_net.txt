@_subject: Gay NaughtyMail Newsletter 
Don't know if you are the right contact but I am still having a problem with the GAY newsletter.  Had rec'd it for months, than it stopped after making some purchases! I contacted you, and started to receive them again, only to have it stopped again?
if you are NOT the correct contact, please advise, if you know, where I would send an e-mail.
