@_subject: Question reports on Y2K report 
Has anyone read "The McAlvany Intelligence Advisor" of Febuary 1998?
The millenium Bug: Global cyber-meltdown in the year 2000 PART 1
Mr McAlvany has a very domesday perspective.  Does his report have
alot of Truth or alot of Hype?
Please don't flame me to hard for my ignorance,  I'm just attempting
to seperate the CHAF from the WHEAT.
Thank you for any guidance

Unfortunately it does not have a URL it is a printed report ( Febuary
1998), & I was given a copy of it.  One paragraph in the report ( that
I have read so far) does reference  Have not had the time to look at the Home Page for the report, but
could possibly be at However, the report it self discusses all areas that the Y2K bug could
affect. The Only location, that I have found so far, is at the
subscription office  ( subscription is to high for me )
