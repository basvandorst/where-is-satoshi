Could I entice someone to remind me of where the anon FTP site (and
directory) is located? I seem to recall that it was on soda.berkeley.edu
but beyond that, my memory fails me....

You must not follow the Usenet nesgoups sci.crypt, alt.privacy, alt.privacy.clipper, comp.eff.org.talk (etc, etc, ad nauseam)
which Sternlight frequents. He even has a news.group named for him (by his detractors), alt.fan.david.sternlight.  ,-)

 I would like to (firstly) extend my personal thanks to you for posting
 the article in sci.crypt, and (secondly) for expressing your opposition
 to the "key-escrow" initiative. I, and I am sure many others, appreciate
 your viewpoints on the entire fiasco and stand alongside you in  opposition of this threat to personal freedom and privacy in the dawning
 new age of information.
 Your paper is well-written and presents the facts in a succint and
 indisputable fashion. I look forward to the seeing the issue in print,
 and any counter-point articles which may also appear in this issue.
 Cheers,

John Gilmore wrote -
No kidding. I just ftp'd the des_key_search.ps file from ftp.eff.org
and browsed through the first few pages (hats off to Michael for a fine piece of work). This is indeed an important milestone and will
have an impact on the cryptographic implementations used by banks, etc.
in the very near future. It should be interesting to see what the future
holds ....
...and in another communique -
That would be an interesting revelation, wouldn't it? ,-)

 That's an interesting point (images of "Wild Palms" conjured).
 This _is_ the wave of the future, as Tim implies, and it's
 unfortunate that instances such as this (segway) tarnishes what
 it is that I think many of us are trying to espouse in the
 cypherpunk movement.

 I find myself straddling the line most of the time, but I have to
 come down solidly on the side of privacy-advocate, if push came to
 shove. However, push isn't shoving, so we (cypher-punk-advocates)
 should all be able to heterogeneously work our goals -- soild, secure
 and unmolested crypto for the masses. Let's be realistic -- and
 effective.
Anyone who thinks that this battle can be won purely on the grounds of
technology is dead wrong. Political leverage is a factor which we
must, absolutely be striving for.
We're getting there, slowly (very slowly) through education, but
digital realization is something that is not going to happen
overnight. The impact has yet to hit home in the public sector.

 I went back through my archives and read this message; actually the
 context in which it was written could be construed that "we"
 is either party (NSA or Cypherpunks).
 After re- reading the remainder of his (or her) post, I think he's
 right for the most part. Messages containing hype (like yours, that
 I told myself I wasn't going to respond to) consist of much more
 paranoia than substance. Paul Ferguson               |   privacy \'pri-va-see\ n, pl, -cies;

Doug Merritt writes -
I'm not sure how much it will help you in distinguishing your objective,
but one of the best general purpose references that I have seen is the sci.crypt Usenet newsgroup FAQ. It's posted occasiuonally to sci.crypt,
but I can't think of a site (offhand) where you can FTP it. If you have
access to a gopher or WAIS, give that a try.

 I can make life much easier for you simply by mentioning the fact
 that you can add the line:
     clearsig = on
 to your CONFIG.TXT file (Drive:\path\PGP\config.txt). Once you add
 this line (note to dox writers: add it to the next version release,
 especially as a  line in the default config), then you
 won't have to worry about adding that pesky argument on the command
 line ever again!
