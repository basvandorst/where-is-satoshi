Sorry to clutter the list but:
I had sent email about beta-testing Chaum's ecash scheme.  I've since lost
my copy of the original announcement (had a drive crash - joy!) and have
never received a reply.
Could some kind soul send me a copy of the announcement?

Ironically, about 2 hours before I read this message I decided to go
that route - I'm going to be doing some consulting (installing a couple
PowerMacs and the software on them) and my buddy who is subcontracting the
Mac work to me is willing to pay me in trade so I am getting a 486DX-25
with a 120 meg drive hodgepodged out of his spare parts.  I want to run linux on this beast and would like some suggestions from the
list - which of the linux CDs do you recommend?  I want to have full network
services running on it.  I need a minimum of POP3/SMTP (my Duo will be grabbing
my mail using StarNine's PT-Inet gateway), a web server, NNTP, ftp, all the good
I'm completely unfamiliar with linux other than hearing people rave about it.
I do have a moderate amount of Unix experience though, as I used to have a BBS
running on an AT&T Unix PC and also administered an AT&T 6300 running Xenix.
This was all a long time ago though - both machines were brand new and just
introduced on the market when I got my hands on them.  Since then, I've just
been a user, no root access anywhere.

I just pick a sentence and use either the first letter of each word or the
last.  If I pick a verse of a song that makes it easy to remember.
If you're willing to chance a little less security of the phrase, pick one
from a book or CD you have near your terminal - I have four or five hundred
paperbacks within 10 feet of my terminal.  It is very easy to remember "book x,
chapter 5 paragraphs 8 through 12."  If you feel paranoid, add 1 letter to each
of the letters derived from your special phrase or some similar modifying

Eli, what I mean is, say you are using the stanza
Can we film the operation,
Is the head dead yet?
Get the widow on the set,

as a mnemonic.
The pass phrase becomes cwftoithdygtwotsgudl
If you pick a simple modification like add 1 to the first letter, 2 the second,
3 to the third, and then repeat (123123) you get a pass phrase of
dyiuqlujgziwxqwtixen.  Throw in some numbers and you should get a decently
random pass phrase that is easy to remember.
If you're really paranoid, pick two phrases from different books and use words
from both to compute the phrase.
Hardly a major security risk if you pick something obscure.

@_subject: Privacy Postage 
Here's a suggestion for the remailer operators who log usage.  When it comes
time to create a dummy message for traffic spoofing, loop it N steps through
the remailer web and have it end up at a randomly selected message sender's
address.  I suggest weighting the selection according to the number of messages
the sender has sent.  Since the dummy is encrypted anyway, this will also help
the people using the remailers to spoof traffic analysis attempts as well.
Combined with random delay, this should make life a little more hellish for
anyone analyzing the traffic, as the dummies will no longer be distinguishable
by being eventually swallowed by a remailer.
The minor inconvenience of occasionally having an unwanted postage stamp
clutter one's mailbox is just the price of doing business with the remailer.
Hell, I'll even design a nice ascii postage stamp file for anyone who decides
to implement this.

@_subject: How irritating are anon encrypted pgp messages 
Personally, I don't like them.  I can see that there are times when someone
would not want anyone to know what the recipient's email address is, but it is
just more noise to filter for everyone else.  I'm on several other mailing
lists, so I already filter through a couple of hundred messages a day.  What
makes it worse is that they are *all* downloaded to my Duo before filtration
begins.  The last thing I want is more disk space eaten up for off topic
messages, and I can't think anything more off topic than messages no one can
Just my two cents worth.

If there is demand for this, someone should set up a message pool list, not
use cypherpunks.  If there was a pool list, I'm sure it would get traffic.

I guess you're right - if they're so clueless that they have to get you to
run grep for them they're clueless enough to be stymied by crypt - all you
have to do is go "Duh, its encrypted, I don't know how to uncrypt."
How long do you think it'll be before crypt disappears, though?
Are these machines connected to the net?  If so, pointing them in the
direction of the remailers might be a good thing.
P.S. I realize it is a lot easier for me to make these suggestions than
for you to implement them - I don't have to deal with the consequences.

@_subject: Remailer postage 
Where can I get the Magic Money software?  I'm also interested in a combination
FV/MM approach to anonymous postage.  I'm still waiting to get my linux box set
up (hassle with client paying the bill and all that fun stuff) but am
considering starting a remailer once I get the site set up.
I am concerned about the ethics of having a paymailer feed into the free
remailer soup - how would their operators react if I'm effectively making money (no matter how little) off of them?
In the interest of preserving anonymity, perhaps their should be a set postage
rate - that way someone could use a digital stamp anywhere, helping to confuse
the audit trail.
I'm not sure if I want to get involved in the hassles of redemption though.  It
would probably become a major hassle for all the operators to have to do that
much accounting on a regular basis.

@_subject: Thoughts on Data Havens 
Re: This is a known weakness of the wizvax style remailers.  It is a shame that
they are so easy for naive users to use - while I like the idea of an easy
to use remailer, I have to shudder at how many people think that they are
a secure system, especially when the reason they use them is usually because
of a very real fear of the possible consequences if their lifestyle becomes
Post a new PGP key and encrypted address block weekly to alt.data.havens,
alt.2600, or a stegoed picture to alt.binaries.pictures.whatever.  If you
are limiting usership, perhaps an autoencrypting majordomo list. If you do decide to go the steganography route, keep in mind that users
on other platforms will want to use your DH and pick your stego program
accordingly.  As a Mac user, few things irritate me as much arj and zip
files on ftp sites.  gzip is a pain also, but at least I can un-gzip in
my shell account before downloading.
One way of solving the traffic analysis problem is to have the DH account
also act as a remailer.  It would also be a good idea to only allow DH
commands to be executed if the encrypted (mandatory) control message arrived
from another remailer account - people knowledgeable enough to be using a
dh will probably not mind if they are "forced" to route traffic through
the remailer network - anyone paranoid enough to be a client is going to
tack your address block on the end of a long chain they created themselves.
As an added security measure, when a valid control message is received,
an identical length stream of random garbage should then be encrypted and
passed into the remailer pool.  This would be easier if remailers supported
some sort of bit sink command to trash a message rather than pass it along.

Basically, Dave wants to make sure that he can't see what's in the file. My
scheme guarantees that the file is unreadable to anybody but the owner
until the owner asks for it back. If return of the file is automated,
Dave'll never know what's in it. Alice should, of course, further protect
her data if she feels the need.
Change the payment structure a little and you don't have those worries.
Alice doesn't pay for thirty day storage, but rather pays for at least
thirty day storage. If she thinks she'll be getting the file back in
fifteen days, she only pays for that long. If she needs it for longer than
that, she sends another payment before the file expires.
That's the job of a data broker, not a data haven. Dave might well wish to
offer that service, too, but, if I were him, I'd keep the two obviously
