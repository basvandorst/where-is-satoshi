I got this on the LAN at work.
Does anyone know this guy?  Does anyone have any questions that they would
like me to ask?  I could take notes and let you know what he says (if
anything).  I imagine this guy is going to say things like "Don't leave your computer

I'd like to ask very poignant questions since this will be my second to

And I really don't care what my boss thinks of my questions. ;)

forward all answers to the list. Thanks a bunch....
