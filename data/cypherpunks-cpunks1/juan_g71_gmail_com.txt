"The essential character of a free society is this: That which is
not forbidden is permitted." That's a useless tautology. The essential character of a free society is
unconditional respect for life liberty and property of people, worldwide,
PLUS a libertarian culture. "The essential character of an unfree
society is the inverse, that which is not permitted is forbidden."
That's the inverse of the previous, virtually meaningless tautology. "The U.S. began as a free society without question;" That's a glaringly false statement. The US began as a **slave society** and remained a **slave society** until
a crazy **civil war** ended slavery well into the 19th century, though
that was **not** the main goal of the civil war anyway.
Today the US is the biggest fascist country on the planet (fascism =
militarism, nationalism, collusion of big business and government).
I'm wondering if Dan's technical views on so called cybersecurity are as
idiosyncratic as his political theory?
