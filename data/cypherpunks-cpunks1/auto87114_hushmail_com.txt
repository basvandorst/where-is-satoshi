Net Privacy Bill Called 'Trojan Horse'                  By Robert O'Harrow Jr, Washington Post
                 WASHINGTON, DC, U.S.A.,
                 25 Oct 2000, 6:14 AM CST
                 The legislation began as an effort to protect people like
                 Amy Boyer, a New Hampshire woman who was slain by
                 a man who tracked her down after buying her Social
                 Security number on the Internet.                  In May, Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., proposed a law to sharply limit the sale
                 of the identifying numbers, which often serve as hooks for electronic
                 dossiers about the whereabouts, credit histories and lifestyles of millions
                 of Americans.                  Then the information industry got involved. Now privacy advocates say
                 Gregg's modified measure, part of an appropriations bill set to pass in the
                 final days of Congress, is a "Trojan horse" that does more harm than good,
                 because loopholes allow giant data brokers, banks, marketers and even
                 private detectives to exchange or sell the numbers among themselves.                  That means such companies will be free to use the numbers to track down
                 debtors or deadbeat parents, collect personal data, conduct                  investigations, and build profiles about what people buy and do.                  The debate is the latest flare-up over one of the staples of the information
                 age, a number that enables government agencies, marketers                  information brokers to keep close tabs on a proliferation of data about
                 individual Americans.                  Some privacy activists believe that Social Security numbers should be
                 used only with individuals' permission. At the same time,
 information
                 industries that rely on unfettered access to personal information fear losing
                 control over a key to their business.                  "It is just the worst kind of legislation," said Edmund                  consumer advocate at the US Public Interest Research Group,
 who has
                 worked with Consumers Union, the American Civil Liberties Union and the
                 Clinton administration to oppose Gregg's proposal. "It is supposed to do
                 something good, but it actually makes things worse."                  Tim Remsburg, Amy Boyer's stepfather, who originally asked Gregg to
                 introduce the bill, is angry about how it evolved. "It sure isn't as effective as
                 what I asked for at the beginning," he said in an interview. "They want to
                 put Amy's name on this."                  A Gregg spokesman defended the legislation, saying it will make it illegal
                 to sell Social Security numbers to individuals. But he acknowledged that
                 the current legislation was crafted with help from the Individual Reference
                 Services Group (IRSG), an industry association that includes some of the
                 nation's largest data marketers.                  Members include such companies as Acxiom Corp., Equifax Inc. and
                 Trans Union LLC, which have strongly opposed any efforts to curb access
                 to personal data.                  IRSG representative Ronald Plesser, who worked with Gregg's office on the
                 legislation, did not return repeated telephone calls. In a Sept. 28 letter to
                 Gregg's office, Plesser blasted more stringent restrictions proposed by the
                 Clinton administration.                  A letter from IRSG said, "Your bill strikes the right balance by providing
                 strong privacy protections without undermining the range of important and
                 socially beneficial activities by business and government that have
                 developed based upon the use of SSNs."                  One exception also would permit state and local governments to continue
                 selling records containing Social Security numbers. The provision is
                 worded in such a way that, critics say, it would allow businesses buying
                 those records to use Social Security numbers with no legal restraints.                  Remsburg's stepdaughter, Amy Boyer, 20, was fatally shot last year by a
                 man who had been stalking her for some time. The man, who killed himself
                 after killing Boyer, acknowledged at a Web site that he obtained details
                 about Boyer from brokers on the Internet.                  "It's a significant restriction on the ability of individuals to get Social
                 Security numbers," said Gregg spokesman Edmund M. Amarosi. "We feel
                 it will have a significant impact on preventing a recurrence of what
                 happened to Amy Boyer."                  In a statement, Gregg's office said that "the exceptions that are outlined in
                 the Amy Boyer Law were the result of thoughtful consideration of the
                 impact that a complete ban on the use of Social Security numbers would
                 have on our nation's economy."                  Until recently, at the request of industry, the law also prohibited states
                 from enacting tougher legislation. But Amarosi said that exception would
                 be dropped because of objections from the administration and others.                  Copyright (C) 2000, The Washington Post. Reprinted with permission.                  Reported By The Washington Post,  .
