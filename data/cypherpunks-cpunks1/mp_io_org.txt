Sorry for taking so long to respond to this.
I have been checking out the Canadian rules for exporting crypto.
Basically (according to "A Guide to Canada's Export Controls",
published by the Department of Foreign Affairs and International
Trade) public domain software can be exported from Canada -- one
might need to file a form with Canadian Customs for each export,
but the export it self is legal. (Public domain is defined as
technology that has been made available without restrictions upon
it's further dissemination. Copyright restrictions do not remove
technology from the public domain. So, I'm not quite sure if PGP
falls within that definition.)
However, goods of U.S. origin are export restricted, unless said
goods are further processed outside the U.S. so as to result in a
substantial change in value, so some of the PGP development would
need to be done in Canada.

No. Export of crypto to Canada is legal because Canada prohibits the
further export of goods of U.S. origin. Before the Canadian government
will allow further export of crypto software from the U.S., there must
be lot of improvement done to the product within Canada. The exact
rules are not well defined, but with crypto I expect that the CSE
(Communications Security Establishment -- our version of the NSA)
would push for at least 50% Canadian content. So I don't expect to
see PGP being exported legally any time soon.
I have talked with the bureaucrat that I think you are referring
to, and he said no such thing. He said that public domain crypto
software that is entirely of Canadian origin was, in his opinion
not covered. When I talked to him, he stressed that PGP is still
