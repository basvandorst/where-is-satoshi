A good idea (or at least not a "bad" one).  While I agree that CPSR, EFF and company should be supported in their fight, too often has the cry been heard, "It's not OUR task, leave it to the professionals."  PZ was willing to put it ALL on the line.  [ ASIDE: I am assuming that simply being ON this mailing list is sufficient to get you _On_File_. ]  We can NOT allow the likes of Dr.'s Sternlight and Denning to dictate public opinion.  Adding our (Respectable, Considerable, Informed, etc.) voice can only help.

Four of the "top ten" reasons to support Jim's proposal:
10) It's voluntary.
 9) It's too late for many of us (to preserve a low profile) anyway.
 8) The public *NEEDS* to be educated about Crypto-Privacy!!!!!
 7) It will teach them to spell Cypherpunks.

entrepreneurs, financially successful and *ACTIVE*.)

It must be nice to be a sysadmin of a net where you have the time to run
around and make sure all your users have access to MIME-aware mail agents.
I only manage 50 users on three flavors of U*NX using 5 different terminal
emulators, and just can't seem to find the time.
Maybe I can talk the tax-payers of CA into paying me overtime to do this.

I'd like to think that MY political beliefs have changed significantly since

your life to change your politics.  My views shifted sharply right with
the birth of my first kid.  They shifted (up? sideways?) towards
Libertarianism several years ago when government interference caused me to
become unemployed.  That trend continues the longer I spend on the net.

Check out the lead article in the "Summer 94" issue of _Mondo2000_.
It is a spoof by Bart Nagel that starts off sounding like steganography.
The article basically states that the photo-journalist-publisher industry
is proposing that all images be encoded using stego techniques to contain
unique identifiers that would prevent copy infringements.  The article
starts in a *VERY* believable fashion before trailing off into an obvious
spoof.  Very well done.

@_subject: Cantwell bill outcome 
The following post to 'eff.talk presents what, IMO, is one of the most
plausible explanations for the ITAR crypto restrictions.  I guess I'm
not nearly devious enough to work for a TLA.  I believe NO request for
export of the App. Crypto disk will be approved as long as this type of
(semi-hidden) agenda is driving the descisions.
However, with the (continuing) spread of PGP, even this argument is bogus:-)

I decided to call around Washington a bit about the unanimous House
Intelligence Committee vote against relaxation of export controls on
I ended up speaking to Greg Frasier, an aide at the House Intelligence
Committee.  He basically reiterated the case re national security and
legitimate needs of law enforcement.
FYI, reportedly, the report is due (from the President) 150 days after
the enactment of the bill.
A couple of interesting statements from Mr. Frasier (paraphrased -- I
didn't record the conversation!):
!	While they are aware that software for secure encryption is
!	available from non-US, they are making a best effort to prevent
!	a standard from emerging, while hoping that some escrowed
!	encryption scheme will gain acceptance.
I was surprised by the unanimous vote, but he was not.  He says that there
has been a lot of discussion on this on the committee, but the security/enforce
  ++ment concerns generally prevail.
My impression is that the range of possible outcomes went from outright
rejection of export reform (at worst), to a request for a report from the
President (at best).  I would guess that as long as there is any hope of
promulgating government key escrow, they will do their best to discourage
the adoption of non-escrowed strong cryptography.

@_subject: Bidzos and the NSA 
posted to talk.politics.crypto in response to Tim's article...
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
  I think the issue, at this point, is not so much whether the NSA goons
actually threatened his life, but that they have consistently attempted to
suppress crypto anyway they can.  That the NSA has tried to intimidate
Bidzos is no secret.  That the NSA considers PGP a threat to their domain
is also well known.
  Given that the purpose of the ITAR restrictions appear to be to prevent
an international standard from forming, I think we need to refocus on the
issue of presenting strong crypto as "a right", inevitable, and ubiquitous.
  CPSR and EFF are doing an admirable job of taking the fight to the beltway;
but outside the net, the grass roots support just isn't there.  As has been
pointed out by PRZ et al., the primary reason to avoided hacks to PGP is
that doing so fragments what standards we have now.  The release of the
MIT PGP was the first step in legitimizing cryptography.  The next step is
to install interoperable crypto on EVERY box out there.  While I don't
advocate bypassing your local sysadmin, try to get PGP installed on each
machine you touch.  Use 2.6 (MIT in U.S., _ui_ elsewhere).  Publish your
key.  Tell your friends.  Annoy your family.  Irrate your boss ;-).
  My wife suggested that my activities would have gotten me "black-listed"
40 years ago.  I suggest that the NSA would like to do exactly that to
individuals like Bidzos and PRZ, but it is too late (and the net would make it virtually impossible anyway).  Besides, some things are worth fighting for.

Most TLAs are required, by their charter/nature/whatever, to have a very
paranoid world view.  Governmental Intelligence (oxy-moron) deals with
*POSSIBILITIES* before considering intent.  For the most part, this is
useful.  However, it works both ways.  WE must also deal with Possibilities
before considering Intent.  Most employees of TLAs are, IMO, honest and
patriotic citizens.  It only takes ONE, however, to destroy all trust and
credibilty for the agency.
The NSAs refusal to publicly discuss ways to safeguard against such abuse
is one of the key arguments against Clipper/EES and Digital Telephony
issues currently under debate "on the net."  (However, I *STRONGLY* urge
the TLAs to continue their hard-nosed positions.  Stand fast you guys. ;-)
To answer your original question; the reasons why NSA would monitor us will
seem completely sane and reasonable TO THEM.  You MIGHT be engaged in
activities harmful to "the rest of us."  Even Joe Public will find their
arguments difficult to refute, particularly following a terrorist-type
incident involving loss of life.
Likelihood?  ==>  100%
Of course it does.  Any other expectation is unreasonable.  Very few
(even of us altruistic heroes ;-) willlingly relinquish power once
it is acquired.  The trick is limit what they acquire...

To preserve *MY* sanity, I try to imagine that this can't happen here.
However, reality suggests that it has :-(  In this case, IMO, "they"
won't need to stage anything, just be selective in the info they
release.  Taking advantage of the "heat of pasion" is something that
lobbyist are extremely at.  The only way *I* can see to counter it, is to
make sure that crypto is explicitely allowed (not that banning it will
stop anyone ;-)  If it can be advocated as a freedom-of-speech issue BEFORE
the emotions of the public are involved, we have a chance.  If not, check
crypto servers for public keys and mail drop info....

Perhaps by being more charitable to non-hardcore crypto discussions (Perry),
the list could attract more members.  Large groups are much more difficult
to prosecute (persecute) than small ones (yes I know, it's not how big it

It seems like MIT was planning the 2.6 release from the start.  To go to this

@_subject: Unicorn vs.... 
I disagree.  Your name is a pseudonym for "you."  Your identity has been
crafted by your actions and associated with your "name."  Authors routinely
use multiple names under which to publish their works.  Each pseudonym may
generate a different impression in the public, but damage to that
pseudonym/persona is no less real.  Ann Rice choices to publish S&M novels
under a different name but chooses not to conceal this relationship between
her "real" name and the pseudonym.  Black Unicorn choose otherwise.  Once
the relationship has been established, the pseudonym becomes the person.
The association (as I understand it) was accidental.  I am sure Black
Unicorn regrets the disclosure, but it happened :-(
Flaming on the net is the same as flaming in person.  You have to know
when it's time to cool down.  If you don't, you better be willing to
accept the results.  This lesson is one with which every parent should be
familiar.  You start gentle and work your way towards tough until they
get it.
If Black Unicorn had blown his horn at a social event, then he would be
expected to live with the results.  Instead, you would have him live
with the results of another's words.  It is unfortunate that it took legal action to resolve the issue, but some people's attention is harder
to get than others.

     PGP is a freely available encryption program that protects the
privacy of files and electronic mail.  It uses powerful public key cryptography and works on virtually every platform.  PGP: Pretty Good Privacy by Simson Garfinkel is both a readable technical users guide and a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at cryptography and privacy.  Part I of the book describes how to use PGP:  protecting files and email, creating and using keys, signing messages, certifying and distributing keys, and using key servers.  Part II provides background on cryptography,
battles against public key patents and U.S. government export restrictions, and other aspects of the ongoing public debates about privacy and free
