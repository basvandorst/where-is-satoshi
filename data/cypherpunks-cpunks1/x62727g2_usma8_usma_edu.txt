@_subject: Data Encryption Algorithm 
Fellow Cypherpunks,
     I am a cadet at West Point and have been involved in developing a new
encryption algorithm which I believe is stronger than DES. I realize that
many of you enjoy the challenge of breaking encryption schemes and I
wondered if you might be interested in trying to break mine. I would be very
interested in any analysis that you could give of my system. Please contact
me if you are interested.

@_subject: Wiretap Chip 
Intellectual Marvels and Omniscient Beings,
     I am looking for some books on advanced bit manipulation techniques,
matrix manipulation algorithms, and variant functions. Does anyone have a
good bibliography?
     Also, if you have the source code for any of these things, I would be
interested in seeing it.
Thank you very much!

@_subject: Crytography 
I thought this list was supposed to have a lot of technical stuff--something on
the order of disseminating new ideas on the cutting edge of crypto-technology.
Most everything I see these days seems purely political. If there are problems
with RSA v. PGP or the Wiretap Chip (and there definitely are!!!) then we
should concentrate on designing our own. We can do things like redesign and
code the engine in PGP which is normally handled by the RSA proprietary code
and we can work to come up with voice encryption alternatives to the Wiretap
chip. In other words, let's start using resources other than talk. Talk is
cheap but actions are the catalysts of change.
I am interested in working with people (perhaps you) on projects involving
crypto, computers, and telecommunications. If any of you are serious enough to
do more than talk, perhaps we can organize a team to vigorously pursue
these projects.

@_subject: EEPROM Programmers for the PC 
Possessors of all Knowledge Great and Small,
    I humbly beseech thy expertise on a manner in which I have none. I have been told that one can by an EEPROM programmer which fits on a card in the PC or a similar version which merley connects to the PC. I would like to know
   a) if this is so?
   b) how much they cost?
   c) where to find them?
   d) what their memory capacities are?
   e) do EEPROMS run as fast as regular PROMS?
   f) an other pertinent data.
Thank you very much!

@_subject: Publications 
Greetings fellow crypto warriors,
     I am attempting to locate several publications to see if they are still
in existence and where I might them or archives of previous issues. The
publications I am interested in are TAP, NIA, AOTD, NARC, etc. If anyone
knows where I might be able to obtain these or similar publications, please
let me know. Also, does anyone know where any "interesting" ftp sites which
carry files or other data related to these type publications?

received in cypherpunk mail in 3 days.
