Please stop relaying FUD. You have full control over your PC, even if this
one is equiped with a TCPA chip. See the TCPA chip as a hardware security
module integrated into your PC. An API exists to use it, and one if the
functions of this API is 'take ownership', which has the effect of
erasing it and regenerating new internal keys.

I've read your objections. Maybe I wasn't clear. What's wrong in
installing a cryptographic device by default on PC motherboards?
I work for a PKI 'vendor', and for me, software private keys is a
nonsense. How will you convice "Mr Smith" (or Mme Michu) to buy an
expensive CC EAL4+ evaluated token, install the drivers, and solve the
inevitable conflicts that will occur, simply to store his private key? You
first have to be good to convice him to justify the extra depense.
If a standard secure hardware cryptographic device is installed by default
on PCs, it's OK! You could obviously say that Mr Smith won't be able to
move his certificates from machine A to machine B, but more than 98% of
the time, Mr Smith doesn't need to do that.
Installing a TCPA chip is not a bad idea. It is as 'trustable' as any
other cryptographic device, internal or external. What is bad is accepting
to buy a software that you won't be able to use if you decide to claim
your ownership... Palladium is bad, TCPA is not bad. Don't confuse the

And do you seriously think that "you can't do that, it's technically not
possible" is a good answer? That's what you're saying. For me, a better
answer is "you don't have the right to deny my ownership".

How? TCPA is only a cryptographic device, and some BIOS code, nothing
else. Does the coming of TCPA chips eliminate the bugs, buffer overflows,
stack overflows, or any other way to execute arbitrary code? If yes, isn't
that a wonderful thing? Obviously it doesn't (eliminate bugs and so on).
I use cryptographic devices everyday, and TCPA is not different than the
present situation. No better, no worse.
