I suppose you know why we don´t have that (the remailing issue). But I kinda have another idea. Just start every subject line with eg -C-P- like I did now, then it would be really easy to filter all the mail.

The "-C-P-" think should of course be found in some kind of faq and/or in the subscribtion welcome message.
That might be a better idea yes. :)
Some nice person might even forward "serious" remailed e-mails to the closed list (since they don´t seem to be too frequent).
