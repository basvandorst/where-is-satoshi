It was open for a couple of years but is now blocked.  I checked a week ago.

Actually, the latter is group-name at demon.co.uk, and it's intended for
demon customers.  I believe they don't police this too heavily (ie they
could chop connections from non-demon sites) but if it's heavily overused
or abused there's a chance it might disappear.  These sites are *not*
anonymous remailers, in case anyone thought that.  They post under the
name presented in your mail to it, and if you forge mail the demon one
at least attaches an 'Originator:' line with the real site, and sends
a copy to the postmaster.
Generally, a service not to be abused.
The only open NNTP server I know of at the moment is sol.ctr.columbia.edu,
and it has user limits and time restrictions.  Still, it's better than none.

@_subject: A link encryption protocol to crytique ;-) 
: T[i] is generated by a pseudo random process, similar to shuffling a deck of
: cards.  For each i, fill the vector with the values 0 to D-1.  Then two random
: indexes (j & k) are chosen (to be different) and the two values at
: T[i,j] and T[i,k] are swapped.  This can be iterated an arbitraty number of
: times (L) to ensure a good "shuffle" of the values.
I saw this particularly clueless statement and stopped even trying to follow
the rest of it.  Still, I made an even more stupid blunder on sci.crypt a few
weeks ago myself, so I can't criticise.  All I can say is I learned from my
mistake and will leave thinking up new crypto schemes to the experts.

blows away the security of the program...
No, I think this suggestion should be put down now, or we'll splinter and
give them exactly the divide-and-conquer opening they're looking for.

Thats what people have *always wanted* to do.  RSA won't let them.  That's
why any talk of a newer friendlier Bizdos is bullshit.

*I* don't need to.  PKP don't have a patent in Britain.
That's *NOT* what we want to do.  We have perfectly good code that we trust
already, called pgp.  We're offering to pay a patent licence for pgp, not
some RSADEF-derived code with DES that we don't trust.  Hell, *I* would even
pay a license fee for pgp and I'm not even legally obliged to...
Because that's the wrong question.

What a nosey bunch...  I've had this machine on the net for almost a year
and not been fingered by as many strangers as over the last three days.  Anyway,
here's a little experiment in paranoia...  which of these people *aren't*
cypherpunks...?  I've always wondered if joining a list like this would
bring unwelcome attention...  I've marked the people who I know are on
the cypherpunks list with a *.  If any of the rest of them are 'one of
us', let me know.  By elimination we'll work out where the gummint spies
hide out :) ... (The machines that reject finger requests and telnet VRFYs
are pretty suspicious...)  And I'm also particularly suspicious of the
finger from ohio-state - it *was* someone who reads this list (the svp ID
was created especially for it) but there are *no* ohio-state sites in
the mailing list at all.
If this is considered a waste of the list's bandwidth, flame me privately...
In fact, reply privately whatever you have to say... (gtoal at gtoal.com)

@_subject: Voice Privacy 
I started asking about this recently and discovered that a lot of people
are interested in it and some of them are even doing something about it.
The most promising group is an Internet Engineering Task Force working
on a project called 'nevot' (network voice terminal) - I'll include the
readme after this post.  It's only drawback is that it doesn't handle
completely-software low baud rates that'll work over the internet *on top
of* v32bis modems running slip or ppp.  I'm working with some folks to
hack up a really low bandwidth scheme and when our experiments are
successful (if...) we'll feed them back to these folks so that everyone
can use it.
If anyone here is working on low bandwidth digital voice, there's a
mailing list on netphone{-request} - its a low-volume
list and really only for reporting what people are working on; chatty
discussions would probably be better on comp.speech or sci.crypt.
Remember that before we get crypto voice, we need non-crypto voice, so there's no real reason to discuss the basics in a crypto group.
This is baically what the multi-media extentions to email are about - check
up on MIME if you don't know about it.  Email mechanisms are fine - the
concept of a 'software answering machine' is seductive, but we don't need
anything special when you can say 'mail -voice fred' and pick up a mike and
talk into it...
sd is a session directory written by Van Jacobson, LBL, available for
anonymous ftp at ftp.ee.lbl.gov.
The nevot/sd directory contains a replacement for the sd start_audio
procedure, which you can insert into your ~/.sd.tcl startup file. Make
sure that the directory containing the Nevot binary is in your path.
Use at your own risk (i.e., don't blame VJ if it doesn't work...).
If you experience difficulties, check the problems.tex file in the
doc directory.

@_subject: RSA patent! 
Could you tell us more about this?
Don't patent holders *have* to license patents to all comers?  If say a rich
sugar-daddy could be found who would put up the same scale of money as Lotus
and Microsoft have, to use these patents - on behalf of Phil and PGP users -
would they be obliged to license it?  (I'm assuming if they did they would
have to offer roughly similar conditions, and not charge punitively to force
us out the market)
If yes - then who do we know that's rich? :-)
If no - are they doing anything wrong that we could get them in court over?
