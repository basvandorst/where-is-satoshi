possible answers:
1) because, for a variety of reason, they like "made here" stuff AND/OR  they had money to absolutely spend.  Grand projects like that are good for rallying the troops and inducing all sort of state-desired emotions.  Rule Umpteen of govt: why buy off-the-shelf when you can spend twenty times to get to copies of custom-made inferior product?
2) because they *know* that everything else is operationnally broken (yeah, right! )

@_subject: Fwd: Important Announcement from Zero-Knowledge Systems 
==================BEGIN FORWARDED MESSAGE==================
Dear Freedom Premium Services Customer,
Zero-Knowledge is introducing Freedom Privacy & Security Tools 3.0, the next generation of its online security software for consumers. This new software includes a personal firewall, form filler/password manager, ad manager, cookie manager and keyword alert. As a result, we are focusing our main development efforts on this product as well as other software solutions providing online security.
As such, I regret to inform you that Freedom Premium Services - Anonymous Web Browsing and Private Encrypted Email - will be discontinued as of October 22nd, 2001. This decision was not taken lightly. It reflects the ongoing high cost and limited returns of operating the Freedom Network - the engine that drives the encryption and anonymity process. This is especially true since our customers and partners increasingly choose to purchase ready-to-use solutions that provide security and safety online - such as personal firewall, password manager and keyword alert - rather than nym-based services. For the past two years we have worked very hard to develop and maintain a sustainable private network and we thank you for all your support of our endeavor.. We share your disappointment and we apologize for the impact this decision will have on your online activities. For detailed information regarding the process we will be implementing to shutdown the Freedom Network, please visit us at  This link contains important and critical information pertaining to your e-mail accounts as well as our special refund policy. We strongly recommend that you visit the above link.
Freedom Network shutdown overview:
A partial network shutdown will occur on Thursday, October 11th, 2001:
 	Freedom nym mailboxes will not accept any more incoming mail as of October 11th, 2001.
 	You will still be able to retrieve mail sent to your nym mailboxes prior to October 11th, but only until October 22nd, 2001.
 	You will however be able to send mail and browse anonymously until October 22nd, 2001.
A complete network shutdown will occur on Monday, October 22nd, 2001:
 	All the Freedom servers will be taken offline.   	You will no longer be able to browse anonymously or, send and receive nym mail.
