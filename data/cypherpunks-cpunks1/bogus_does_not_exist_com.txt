Here is some code to run on a SparcStaion (I or II) to generate random
numbers based on noise from the audio chip.  I have not tested the true
randomness of the out but cause I don't know how.  Thus if anyone can
please do and send me the results.  I suppose some minor tweeking can be
made for the mid range gain for a better spread. unfortunatly there is no way to turn off the u-law audio compression
the chip uses to outputs data if you plot the out put you will see the
problem the compression caused.

@_subject: Problems of anonymous posts 
(This is from Hal; I still can't post from Portal.)
After going to enormous efforts to create a network of anonymous remailers,
we are hoist by our own petard, as our list receives strange, irrelevant,
and argumentative posts through our own anonymous remailers.  (Not all
anonymous posts are like this, but there have been quite a few in the last
few weeks which fall into these categories.)
This should challenge us to reconsider the value of anonymity and remailers.
Are we working only to make the net safe for the immature and incoherent?
I would say not, but these posts should remind us of how incomplete is the
infrastructure needed for successful use of anonymity.
A brief recap of the benefits of anonymous mail: presently, on the net,
all mail is tagged with the sender and destination.  This means that not
only the recipient, but any net snoopers and sysops at systems through
which the mail passes, may be able to know that person A is sending mail
to person B.  This kind of information can be used to build up dossiers
of who talks to whom.
Worse, as we move into an era of electronic commerce, more and more of our
lives may begin to take place on the net.  We may shop, find entertainment,
do business, even work for a living across the network.  This will open up
even more opportunities for collecting data about how we live our lives.
In my opinion, the best way to preserve our privacy is to make it impossible
to collect this data.  Anonymous remailers, and their cousins, IP bouncers
(which perform an analogous function for telnet-type connections), can
prevent the collection of this kind of information by hiding exactly who is
communicating with whom.  These services can serve as the basis for the
other privacy-protecting technologies we've been discussing, such as digital
cash.  There's not much point in using digital cash to prevent tieing
customers to vendors if monitoring the net will provide that information
This isn't just a futuristic concern, either.  Already today the government
is taking steps which could, under some not-so-far-fetched extrapolations,
get people on the list in trouble.  Many people on this list have communicated
with Phil Zimmermann, for example.  What if email logs were used to track
all those people down, and they became suspects in this criminal investigation
that the government seems to be pursuing?
It's not even impossible that the government could someday try to paint the
cypherpunks themselves as a subversive organization.  Think how much more
difficult any such diabolical attack would be if people subscribed to the
list via remailers, under digital pseudonyms.  These days, with the shaky
legal status of cryptography, we of all people should be able to see the
benefits of anonymous communication.
The problem is, then, how to gain the benefits of anonymity, while avoiding
the abuses.  One solution which we have long discussed is reputations and
pseudonyms; another is making people pay to use remailers.
The way reputations work is that people would digitally sign their anonymous
postings.  This way someone could post anonymously and build up a reputation
by means of a series of postings signed under the same name.  As time went
on, they would no more want to damage the reputation of their pseudonym
than they would want to damage their reputation under non-anonymous posting.
To make this work, people need to be able to easily filter their mail
on the basis of the pseudonym it came from, rather than the (irrelevant)
anonymous remailer which sent it.  Then they can choose to accept and read
mail from anonymous posters who have built up a good reputation while
ignoring that from those who have ruined their good (pseudo) name.
Karl Barrus has done some experiments along these lines.  He described
some time back a system he had for working with the elm mail reader,
one of the most common Unix-based mail agents.  The software will display
the true originator of PGP-signed posts (anonymous or not).  This allows
readers to apply the same standards to signed anonymous mail as to regular
mail.  It raises anonymous posters to the same level, and holds them to
the same standards, as other posters.  This software could allow anonymous
posters to build up their reputations, encouraging more responsibility on
their part.
The other solution, pay-for-use remailers, has also been pioneered by
Karl.  His idea is to make the remailer a little harder to use by forcing
the user to include some digital postage (based, I think, on what Tim May
called "poor man's postage stamps").  This could help reduce the volume
of anonymous mail and make it less likely that joke or trivial messages
would be posted.  (We could even consider applying Karl's approach to
the list as a whole; people would have to apply ahead of time for posting
tokens in order to post.  This might force people to take a little more
care and time in their postings.)
I don't think Karl's efforts have been sufficiently appreciated here.
He is quietly working to create the tools needed to allow anonymity to
be a useful and important part of the net architecture rather than the
annoying sideshow that it sometimes seems to be becoming.  We need to
support Karl, work to bring his innovations into other remailers and other
mail agents, if we want to gain the benefits from what we have done so far.

I think the problem here is the amount of time which would be taken
by the moderator.  If you were going to go this route, you might as
well have a completely moderated list.  This slows down list turnaround
and is a lot of work for somebody.
I'm not sure what you mean here.  Perhaps you are talking about someone
who posts saying, "Hi, this is Bill Gates, I just joined your list, and
here's my PGP key, I'll just be posting through these anonymous remailers
for now.  Oh, and to prove it's really me, my annual salary is such-and-
such, which you can confirm by reading the most recent annual report from
Microsoft."  This wouldn't fool anyone for an instant.
Or, someone posts and says, "My name is Deadbeat, here is my PGP key, and
I'll just be posting through anon remailers," then he does so for months
on end.  This also doesn't "fool" anybody, but does represent an ID which
can get established and become as legitimate as other ID's on the net -
in a sense, a "Fake ID"; this is what we call a digital pseudonym.

@_subject: Detecting double-spending (long) 
For those of you who slogged through my description last week of Chaum's
"simple" digital cash which detects double-spending, I've realized on
further thought that a simplification is possible.  Writing that long
essay improved my own understanding of his system.
Recall that the double-spending cash is the product, for i from 0 to
k/2, of f(xi,yi)^(1/3), mod the bank's public modulus.  f() is a one-way
function, one which can't be inverted.  xi and yi were a little complicated,
and here is where my simplification comes in.
Let xi be g(ai), where ai is a random number and g is a one-way function.
Let yi be g(ai xor ), where  is Alice's identifying information,
her account number.  Normally the ai "blinds" that since it is random
and it is xor'd onto it.  But if ever both ai and ai xor  are known,
 is revealed and Alice's goose is cooked.
Everything else works as Chaum suggested; I have just eliminated his ci
and di random numbers.  In his proposal, g took two arguments, and ci and
di were appended for the xi and yi cases.  But I'm convinced now that
these are unnecessary for our purposes.
The purpose for ci and di are to provide "unconditional" anonymity to
Alice if she doesn't cheat.  Look what happens with my simpler system.
She tells Bob ai and yi for certain i's.  Now, g is a one-way function,
but suppose Bob had a big enough computer to try all possible arguments
to g.  Sooner or later he'd find a value Z for which g(Z) was yi.  So
then he could figure that Z equals ai xor , and he knows ai, so
he could find .  This means that in my simplified system Alice
is depending on Bob (and everyone else) being unable to crack g() in
order to stay anonymous.
Chaum's system is better.  By having a g with two arguments he creates
a huge number of solutions to g(Z1,Z2) = yi.  There is no way for Bob to
tell which one is right, so even with infinite computing resources he
can't crack Alice's anonymity.
My thought is, unconditional anonymity is really no better than
computational anonymity in the real world.  Eric Hughes often says
"all cryptograpy is economics".  In practice, beyond a certain point,
anonymity would not be broken by a direct computational attack, but rather
by other means - bribery, theft, etc.  In the real world there is no such
thing as "unconditional" anonymity.  In practice, computational anonymity
is enough.
So my feeling is that for implementation purposes the ci and di in Chaum's
system can be removed, simplifying the protocols somewhat, at the cost
of reducing Alice's anonymity from unconditional to computational.

@_subject: your mailRe: on anonymity, identity, reputation, and spoofing 
I do sympathize with L. Detweiler's concern about multiple identities.
Human nature being what it is, if a series of posts appears quickly taking
one view, people who disagree may think, well, I guess I'm in the minority
on this, I won't make a stink about it.  That's just part of the herd
instinct, which, IMO, we all share.  The lesson is that it is even more
important on the net not to be afraid to take unpopular stands.  You may
find that there are more people who agree with you than you thought.
In particular, although I think Detweiler's posts could be tightened
up considerably, and I don't agree with his solutions in detail, I can
understand his paranoia, having shared it from time to time.
There are some possible technological solutions to some of the issues
raised.  Chaum, in his 1985 CACM paper, describes how "credentials" can
be exchanged among various pseudonyms a person may have.  A credential
can basically be any statement by a 3rd party about a person.  It could
be a statement by a college that he had a certain degree.  It could be
a statement by a government that he had a driver's license.  It could be
a statement by a business that he was an agent for that business.
The credential would be given to the person, then Chaum shows how it
could be re-blinded and shown under other pseudonyms.  The credential
can be verified, but it can't be linked to the True Name or other pseudonyms
of the holder.
We could think about using something like this for reputations.  Take
Nick's question about how a new pseudonym could get through the filters.
Maybe the person posts under his real name for a while, then some respected
person is willing to give him a "valued poster" credential.  He can
re-blind this credential and submit it with posts he starts to make under
his pseudonym.  People will know that the pseudonymous poster is at least
potentially capable of making sense, and give his words some weight.  But
there will be no connection to his True Name.
(Of course, this could lead occasionally to a Dr. Jekyll who makes
sensible and weighty posts under his own name, while under his Mr. Hyde
pseudonym he rants and raves.  But hopefully this would not happen too
Other credentials could be related to some of the other points Detweiler
raised, such as list membership > some number of months.  The point would
be that these credentials are voluntary, used to get past people's filters,
and that they retain poster anonymity while giving readers useful information
about the poster.
It's ironic that L. Detweiler, who has played a major part in spreading
awareness of Cypherpunks technology through his widely read Privacy and
Anonymity FAQ, is suggesting that people should be limited in their
use of this technology.  Still, the concerns he raises are going to be
shared by many people, and we should try to be ready with technological
solutions that are consistent with privacy protection.

   Yes, but the positional accuracy required (on the order of the
   wavelength) would be prohibitive to achieve. (Such things may be
   possible for the NRO's DSP (more acronym overloading: DSP stands for
   Defense Support Program) satellites to implement. I haven't heard any
   speculations that this is actually being done.)
   Synthetic Aperture Radar is feasible becuase the wavelengths are so
   much larger.
   The new Keck Telescope will eventually use a second telescope, now
   under construction, located some distance away, for very long baseline
   interferometry...I have no idea if it can be made to work as an actual
   synthetic aperture. Jay Freeman man know.
I wasn't thinking so much of interferometry techniques (although my
reference to synthetic radar certainly implies them), but rather something
on the order of a filter which might work (independent of the wavelength
of light) as follows:
Take, for example, the square box pixellation (is this the right word
here?) used to blot out people's faces on TV sometimes. Put a long
(preferably continuous) series of images into the computer, and build
a model of the movement of the person's head (the camera isn't
perfectly still; assume that the person, however, does stay
still). Use the data about how adjacent pixels change over time to
improve the model of what the person's face really looks like.
This is independent of the wavelength of light -- it does of course
depend on the resolution of the square pixels used to blot the peron's
face, but not particularly on the wavelength or resolution of the
camera (assuming it is much better than the square blotches).
I first noticed this effect watching Court TV's coverage of the
William Kennedy Smith rape trial (I was home sick at the time), while
the victim testified. I felt that as the person (and camera) moved
around, I could gradually form a better opinion of what the person
looked like than just provided by the square blotches, by noting when
and how the (macro-)pixels changed.
Of course, just filtering a single frame would be better than looking
at the sharp-edged squares. I'm talking about averaging all these
filtered images over time, compensating for movement of the camera and
subject. It would seem to me that over long enough time, perhaps using
more sophisticated mathematics than just averaging (although just plain
averaging seems like the right operation here), if there was actually
enough movement to provide enough resolution, you could eventually get
to a real photographic-quality image of the person.
This process might be similar to CAT scans, where a lot of
low-resolution "pictures" are combined to create a high-resolution
image, except the distribution would be temporal rather than spatial.
I think is relevant to c'punks, because it involves decryption of
an encrypted signal (recovering the face of a person when it was
intentionally distorted). Does this mean that if people like Court
TV really want to blur people's faces, they need to add crypto-secure
noise instead of just averaging the micro-pixels into macro-pixels?
I think so!
and also
I also thought the license plate joke was definately relevant to
c'punks, because it was actually a code, where the cleartext domain
was conceptual rather than textual, just like this mail talks about a
domain in 2-space (or 3-space) images, rather than text. Also, the
fact that the "plaintext" was actually a pun involving multiple coding
schemes made it relevant to this list also IMHO. Also, I think short
humor is appropriate for any list, at least if it is both funny and
computer-related, but I admit that may be stretching it for some here.
I assume that coding (as distinguished from ciphering) is indeed relevant to
this list...

@_author:  
@_subject: Remailer chaining results 
I've done some calculations on the mixing properties of Chaum-style
networks and gotten some interesting results.
Recall that in a Chaum-type remailer network users use nested
encryption and remailing instructions to set up a chain or "cascade"
of remailers.  Each remailer strips off the encryption envelope and
sees the address of the next remailer in the chain or, for the final
remailer, the ultimate destination.  All messages are the same size
and carry no distinguishing features.  We assume that the opponent is
monitoring all messages traffic into and out of all remailers on the
net but can't see what is happening within each remailer.
Let's take a concrete example and suppose there are four remailers.
Everyone sets up a chain of 2 remailers, chosen at random from these
four.  A batch of messages is received by each remailer, which strips
off the envelope and sends them on to the next remailer in the chain,
where they are mixed with the other messages which chose that remailer
as the 2nd in the chain, then sent out to their ultimate destinations.
This model is a little artificial in that we are assuming a certain
amount of synchrony of the operation of the various remailers for
simplicity.  (Note that for this four-node network there are twelve
possible two-node chains where the nodes are different.)
There are three measures that I am interested in: bandwidth used (the
less the better); message mixing (the more the better); and immunity
to subversion (the more the better).  For bandwidth we can measure the
flow through the remailer.  Due to the symmetry of the situation, the
inflow and outflow are equal and the same for all remailers.  Message
flows per remailer are the sum of the flow into the remailer from
outside (the user messages), plus all flows into the remailer from the
other remailers.  Mixing can be measured by a probability distribution
over the outgoing messages which represents how likely they are to be
a given incoming message.  For simplicity this can be expressed simply
as the number M of messages which are equally likely to be the
original (in an earlier message I used entropy which is a log measure
of the same thing).  I am thinking of measuring immunity to subversion
in terms of how much mixing is lost by a certain number of "failed"
(that is, subverted) nodes.  Some networks are vulnerable to "single
point failures", where a single subverted node destroys all the
anonymity.  A more robust network would require multiple failures for
this to happen.  However, it turns out that even in a multiple-failure
network a single-point failure may reveal some information about the
messages, which we can express as a loss in mixing.
Let the total message bandwidth into the network be N packets per time
unit.  Due to symmetry, each node will receive N/4 packets.  With the
chains as defined above, the other three nodes will all be equally
likely to be the 2nd in the chain, so N/12 packets are sent to each of
them.  Simultaneously, N/12 packets come to this node from each of the
others.  This is a total internode bandwidth of N/4 in each direction
per node, or N total per direction.  Add this internode bandwidth to
the user-link bandwidth of N per direction and we get 2N total, or N/2
per node.
At the beginning of each chain, we have N/4 packets come in and get
mixed as each node.  As the packets go out, they are sent to the other
three remailers, and when they leave they may be any of the output of
those three.  Thus they are equally likely to be any of 3N/4 of the
packets, and this is the amount of mixing we have.
If one of the two nodes in your remailer chain is compromised, it
provides no effective mixing.  This means that your message is only
mixed at one node, where it is combined as part of a batch of N/4, so
that is the degree of mixing you have with a single failure.  If both
remailers are compromised then of course you have no mixing, which we
would write as a factor of 1 in uncertainty increase.
This can also be expressed in terms of a percentage compromise of the
network.  If 1 node is compromised, which can be represented as p=.25,
then the six of the twelve remailer paths which use that node will
have single-point failures with the comcomitant reduction in mixing.
In other words, half of the messages will have the full 3N/4 mixing
while half have N/4.  With p=.50, two nodes are compromised.  Two
paths are safe, eight have single failures, and two have
double-failures.  So we have 1/6 of the messages with 3N/4, 2/3 with
N/4, and 1/6 with only 1 mixing.  With p=.75, three nodes compromised,
there are no safe paths; half have single failures and half have
double.  So 1/2 the messages have mixing of N/4 and half have 1.  And
of course with p=1 all messages are compromised with mixing factor 1.
Let me just go on and extend this analysis in one way.  In the
discussion of the chains, we have assumed that the two nodes in the
chain would be different.  Logically though one could have chains
where both nodes were the same.  Let us compare this network with the
one we just did.
There are now 16 possible chains.  Total bandwidth is somewhat less
(since we don't count the messages which stay in one remailer).  Now
only 3/4 of the messages from each node need to get exchanged.  Per
node, there will be N/4 messages to users and 3N/16 messages to other
nodes, for a total of 7N/16 per node or 7N/4 total (above the 7's were
8's).  Mixing is actually improved; there is no limitation on which
input messages might map to which output ones, so we have full N-fold
mixing (compared to 3N/4 above).  With single-point failure mixing is
again N/4 as above.
The failure behavior is quite different.  With p=.25, 1 of the 16
paths is totally compromised, 6 of the 16 have single failures for N/4
mixing, and 9 of the 16 have no failures for N mixing.  With p=.50,
4/16 of the paths have mixing 1, 8/16 have mixing N/4, and 4/16 have
mixing N.  With p=.75, 9/16 have mixing 1, 6/16 have N/4, and 1/16
have N.
It's not clear what measure is useful to compare these failure
situations.  A double-point failure seems much worse than a single
one.  I wonder whether taking a geometric mean (which would be
equivalent to taking the arithmetic mean of the entropies) would be
valid.  If we did that for the p=.25 case, we get average mixing of
.59N^(15/16) for the self-chain network, and .27N for the network
where all chains are two different nodes.  For N less than about
250,000 packets per (network-wide) batch the self-chain network
provides superior average mixing in the p=.25 case by this measure.
Sparing the math, for p=.50 the self-chain network is superior for
batch sizes smaller than 29 packets, and for p=.75 the self-chain
network is only superior for batch sizes smaller than 16 packets.
This suggests that if the network is likely to be mostly safe then the
extra mixing allowed by same-node chains is worth the small increased
risk of exposure.  But as the chance of encountering bad nodes rises
it becomes unwise to take this chance.
Here is a quick summary of the extension of these results to larger
numbers of remailers and longer chains.  Let there be R remailers and
let the chain length be K.  Let the number of message packets per
batch (network wide) again be N.  (I will neglect the differences
between same-node chains and different-node chains as they are
generally small effects on the order of 1/R.)
Bandwidth per node is approximately KN/R.  Network wide it is
therefore KN.  Adding remailer hops increases network bandwidth loads
directly in proportion to the number of hops.  Mixing is approximately
N for K=2 and up, which is the maximum possible.  For K=1 mixing is
Fault tolerance is interesting.  A K-length cascade is invulnerable to
up to K-2 failures!  At K-1 the mixing decreases from N to N/R, a
significant decrease.  And with K failures of course the mixing drops
to 1.  I was surprised how robust these networks are.  The reason is
that with even K-2 compromised remailers in a K-length cascade there
still remains a safe length 2 cascade, and as we saw above that provides
N-fold mixing.
This provides some guidelines on the choice of K.  First, K should
clearly be at least 2.  The increase from K=1 to K=2 increases mixing
from N/R to N, a considerable increase.  Secondly, K should probably
be at least 3.  This will provide full mixing even if you are unlucky
enough to choose a compromised remailer.  Beyond this, you can
calculate that with a chain length of K and probability p of a
compromised node, the expected number of compromised nodes in your
chain is Kp.  This suggests that you should choose K large enough that
Kp is well below K-2.  If you estimate p=.50, for example, you might
choose K=8.  The binomial theorem states that the chance of x failures
out of k nodes where the probability of each failure is p is
(p^x)*((1-p)^(k-x))*k!/x!(k-x)!.  In this example, the chance of 7
failures out of 8 is about 3% and the chances of 8/8 is about .5% for
a total risk of 3.5% that you won't be fully protected.
Now, how many people read this far? ;-)

@_subject: More on remailer chaining 
I have one small addition to the analysis I did yesterday of remailer
chaining effects.  Previously I was assuming that there was a uniform
distribution of messages across remailers, so that all saw the same
number of packets.  How does this change if some remailers are used
more than others?
Again I will sneak up on the problem by taking a concrete example.
Suppose there are two remailers and that we are using two-remailer
chains which include the possibility of using the same remailer twice.
Suppose one of the remailers is used much more than the other.  Take
an extreme case, where remailer 1 is used 90% of the time and remailer
2 is used 10% of the time.  If we suppose that these probabilities
affect both the choice of the first and second remailer in the chain,
then the four possible chains have the following frequencies of use:
1,1   81%
1,2    9%
2,1    9%
2,2    1%
Notice that this also implies that 90% of the messages enter the net
at remailer 1 and 10% at 2, and also that 90% leave via 1 and 10%
leave via 2.
Now, ignoring for a moment the fact that there may be some reason
people are shunning 2 (they suspect it is compromised, or it is
unreliable, or something - but maybe it's just new and a lot of people
haven't heard about it yet), what is the safest way to use this
The key, I believe, is to imitate the observed statistics in your own
choice of a chain, at least for the 2nd hop.  90% of the messages
coming out of the first stage of either remailer will go to remailer
1.  If you want your message to be lost most effectively among the
others, you should choose remailer 1 as your own 2nd hop 90% of the
time.  This way your message will be 9 times more likely to go to 1
than 2, but since there is 9 times the traffic going to 1 than to 2 it
will be perfectly masked.
The result will be that your message is equally likely to be any of
the N messages coming out of the remailer.  Your statistics will match
all of the others.  Therefore, you get a full factor of N mixing with
such an unbalanced network, just as much as you get with a perfectly
symmetrical network - as long as you imitate the network statistics.
The choice of the first remailer in your chain does not appear to be
critical.  We assume the opponent can see which remailer you have
chosen (by tracking your message from your site to the remailer) so
there is no advantage to choosing 1 over 2 as far as secrecy.  You
will get full N-fold mixing in either case.  This is a bit
counter-intuitive; it might seem that choosing 1 is superior to
choosing 2 in terms of mixing.  But look at a specific example:
Suppose 100 messages enter the network, 90 at 1 and 10 at 2.  After
the first step, 9 messages go from 1 to 2 (10% of the 90) and 9
messages go from 2 to 1 (90% of the 10).  Then 90 messages are sent
from 1 and 10 from 2.  Now, if your message entered but had a
90% probability of going to 1 at the second hop, then there is a 90%
chance that it ended up as one of the 90 messages leaving 1, and a 10%
chance that it ended up as one of the 10 messages leaving 2.  This
tells observers exactly nothing about where your message is.  So
choosing 2 as the first hop is just as good as choosing 1.
Although I have not yet extended these results to longer hops and
larger numbers of remailers, my guess is that the same general rule
will apply there as well.  This suggests that it will be useful and
important to have accurate information about the usage levels of the
various remailers so that you can accurately mimic those
How bad is it if you don't have accurate usage information?  According
to my calculations, in the case of two remailers, if the actual
probabilities of the two remailers being used are p and 1-p, and the
probabilities you use are q and 1-q, the mixing level you get
decreases from N to N * (p/q)^q * ((1-p)/(1-q))^(1-q).  If q=p and you
have accurate information there is no reduction.  In the example
above, with p=.9, if you didn't know this and used q=.5, your mixing
level reduces to N*.6.  This is not a huge reduction even for this
rather extreme case, but I can't guess how this will extend to larger
networks and chains.
Assuming these results do hold true, though, it suggests some
interesting "market" dynamics.  Patterns of usage of the remailers may
tend to be stable since anyone who departs from the current usage
pattern will stand out and hence lose security.  It may be difficult
for new remailers to become established since their initial usage
level will be low, making it risky to use them to any significant
degree.  These considerations are somewhat similar to situations where
there are competing but incompatible standards (e.g. Beta vs VHS
VCR's) in terms of the barriers to entry.
There may also be considerable misinformation about usage levels.  It
will be to the advantage of a site to exaggerate the number of
messages they are handling.  Especially if noise messages are used (a
strategy I haven't tried to analyze yet) it would be easy to generate
bogus statistics.  Maybe some organization could collect statistics by
polling remailer users about their practices rather than believing the
operators, and make that information available.
Another point is that, assuming that remailer operation is actually
going to be profitable some day, there will be advantages to being one
of the first to market.  Getting your remailer widely known and used
in the early days could establish market leadership which will have
considerable staying power just from the inherent properties of how
these networks work.  Heavily-used remailers could charge premium
prices while the "little guys" have to be cut rate in order to grow,
compensating users for the loss of security they will experience.
Maybe this will encourage people to make the investment to become what
Tim May has called "Mom and Pop" remailers.  This might be the golden
opportunity to get in on the ground floor.  For more information, send

@_subject: responce to graphic encryption replies 
First, I would like to address the issue of David C.'s spam of the usenet. Mr. Clavedetcher does not work for nor does he represent us in any way. After receiving word from Cypherpunks that he had spamed the list I personally contacted him and informed him to cease and desist these actions or face legal action. We at PrivaSoft do not conduct nor condone such actions on the Net. During my conversation with him I discovered he was a zealous individual looking to make good on our rebate program, as per our Web page. If you should receive any further spams from him or any other over zealous netuser, Please contact me immediately. Also if you could inform me of other news groups/ lists he spammed so I may contact them as well regarding this. Thanx.
    Second I would like to begin addressing several of the issues raised by my inquiry of Graphic Encryption. Firstly Graphic Encryption is the scrambling of a graphic image using an encryption algorithm. In PrivaSoft's case the Image is that of your document, including all text and graphics contained therein. Syntel Sciences, the distributor of PrivaSoft, does not wish to publish its algorithm at this time, however if there is any question as to the strength of PrivaSoft and its Graphic Encryption engine, I would be happy to post a sample document for you to try and crack. Also, I have recently put together an info sheet on the Security provided by PrivaSoft which I can post if there is interest.     One of the key strengths, as I see it, of graphic encryption is that during decryption via hacking, there is an added time element when a human interface is required to verify the product, ( since it is a graphic picture being produced, regular checksums for intelligible words can't be used sans implementing OCR), even if this is only 10 milliseconds per try this is increases the time to crack exponentially beyond that of a data encrypted document of similar key length and algorithm strength.     Once again I would like to apologize on behalf of Syntel Sciences - PrivaSoft for the nuisance caused by the spam done by David C. and I wish to reiterate that such actions are not condoned by us and will not be tolerated.

privacy, we can subscribe ONLY anonymous aliases user_name at alpha.c2.org.
Mailing list messages will be forwarded to your alpha.c2.org adresses through anonymous remailers.
This list is UNMODERATED. Due to our organization, we are unable to find out your true identity, and you are unable to find out where
our list-bot resides. So - you can now have free discussion about all
exploits and great hacks! Just use remailers and be safe...
Remember i) no one can find out where the list resides ii) nobody can
find out that your alpha.c2.org account is subscribed to Hackerpunks
iii) nobody can find out who hides behind alpha.c2.org accounts
iv) nobody can find out that you are using alpha.c2.org aliases.
Everything goes as long as it is about hacking. We shall decide later whether we want to keep non-computer hacking discussions in this
list or make another one. MODERATE FLAMAGE ONLY!
Since remailers are used all the way from you to the list-bot and back,
the time for your messages to reach subscribers will be invariably
longer. You've gotta pay for security. Hackers must be patient!

This thread is probably already due for a change in
the Subject line, but I'll leave it untouched for the moment.
[....] And it sums to a very bleak picture, indeed.
Please forgive my naivete, but are there no legal
weapons available to the 'victims' in such cases?
I'm passingly familiar with the Operation Sundevil
fiasco -- i.e., with the outcome re the principal
'charges'.  I'm appalled, however, at the apparent lack of remedies for return of such seized property.
Are individuals who find themselves in such a predicament simply at the government's mercy (there's
an oxymoron for ya)??

@_subject: I Lost 4 lbs. in 4 Days...Without Dieting!!! 
EAT THE FOODS YOU LOVE
NO WILL POWER REQUIRED
Anyone who has struggled to lose weight, like I did, can tell you DIETS ALONE DON'T WORK !  That's because the difference between thin and overweight individuals has more to do with metabolic rate than what they eat.  It's believed most lean individuals have a
metabolism designed to BURN FAT !
We have designed a product that works
several ways to help you achieve maximum
results from your weight-loss program. This
unique blend of herbs, botanicals and Chromium
Picolinate, improves your metabolism so
your body relies more on stored fat and less on stored proteins.
"LOSE THE FAT....
       NOT THE MUSCLE"
Typically, up to 30% of lost weight is
muscle.  This lowers your metabolic rate and
slows calorie-burning.  This lowered metabolic
rate makes it hard to keep lost pounds from
creeping back.  Result: the "Yo-Yo" syndrome
in which weight is repeatedly lost and then regained.  After each lose-gain cycle the portion of fat increases.
To break this vicious cycle, it is important
to lose only fat while maintaining, or even increasing muscle.  Studies show that optimal
chromium nutrition is an effective part of long-term
fat-loss programs.  Our unique formula of specialized herbs and botanicals is coupled with the best source of chromium available,
patented Chromium Picolinate.
HERE'S EVIDENCE !
Several double-blind crossover studies
conducted along with clinical and laboratory
tests at a leading university and hospital have proven that the ingredients in this product are Without changing dietary or exercise
habits, over a six-week period, subjects in separate studies lost an average of 23% body fat or
approximately 4.4 lbs. of fat, and increased lean body mass by 1.5 lbs.
People over the age of 46 did even better,
and women seemed to do the best.  People
with elevated cholesterol levels averaged a 10%
drop in LDL cholesterol.
          WHAT EXACTLY IS       CHROMIUM PICOLINATE?
It's a bioactive chromium with clinically
proven benefits.  Chromium is vital to
good health and is essential for the efficient
functioning of insulin.  Poor responsiveness to insulin is common and is linked with increased
risk of being overweight, heart disease, elevated
blood fat, high blood presure and diabetes.
Over 90% of American diets provide much
less than the minimal amount of chromium
recommended by The National Academy
of Science.  Most forms of chromium are not
easily absorbed by the body, but chromium
picolinate, being bioactive, is easily absorbed.
In fact, it has been shown to reduce body fat,
lower cholesterol and even reduce elevated
block-sugar in diabetics.
THE DIET BREAKTHRU OF THE CENTURY !!
"Over the last 10 years, I have tried a variety of weight loss methods, spent thousands of dollars and failed at all of them.  By December 1995, I
was the heaviest I had ever weighed-235 lbs.
I had no energy.  My self-esteem had hit rock
bottom... I was introduced to Thermo Lift and have never looked back! My energy level has
boosted and my weight loss increased... In total
I have lost 70 lbs. and went from a size 22 to a
size 12.  The most amazing part - It's So Easy!"

washboard stomach.  By the end of the eighth week
all I could see were solid stomach muscles!  I

abilities."   Chris

@_subject: Bush Gang Suspected In Assault On PresidencyBush Gang Suspected In Assault On Presidency 
Bush gang suspected in new assault on Presidency
by Edward Spannaus and Jeffrey Steinberg
In the midst of the worst global financial crisis in modern history, the
United States Presidency has come under renewed, vicious attack from a
combination of British and nominally ``American'' Bush-League circles.
This latest attack, which one White House official long ago
appropriately dubbed ``bimbo eruptions,'' centered around a Bush
``mole'' who was, unfortunately, allowed to operate inside the Clinton
administration, and who now enjoys high-level security clearances in her
post at the Pentagon.
Linda Tripp, the central player in the renewed assault against President
Clinton--staged around a purported sex scandal involving a young White
House intern, Monica Lewinsky--was a Bush administration employee from
1990, until Bush left office in January 1993. At the urging of senior
Bush administration officials, including Transportation Secretary Sam
Skinner, Tripp was retained by the Clinton-Gore transition team in a
clerical position, and later assigned to work at the Office of the White
House General Counsel, under Bernard Nussbaum and his deputy, Vincent
Foster. All the while, she was operating as part of a treasonous
Bush-League ``fifth column'' within the Executive branch.
While the ``Get Clinton'' media have attempted to portray Tripp as
``apolitical,'' she was, in fact, an ally, from the Bush administration
period on, of then-FBI agent Gary Aldrich, who, in 1996, wrote a
libellous book against President Clinton, {Unlimited Access: An FBI
Agent Inside the Clinton White House,} which also revolved around bogus
claims of White House sexual misconduct (see {EIR,} July 26, 1996,
p.|72.) Aldrich was another Bush-League mole inside the Clinton White
House. His embarrassingly fantasy-ridden book has been trumpetted by the
London-based Hollinger Corporation, the leading British Crown media
cartel; by its subsidiary, {American Spectator} magazine; and by ``Get
Clinton'' money-bags Richard Mellon Scaife.
Tripp emerged in 1995 as an asset of Whitewater Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr, testifying before the Whitewater grand jury and later
before a Congressional hearing on the death of Vincent Foster. When
Lloyd Cutler replaced Nussbaum as White House General Counsel, Tripp,
who by then had been widely identified as an unabashed political enemy
of President Clinton, was reassigned to the Pentagon, where she
eventually got an $80,000-a-year job, which also involved her getting
top-level security clearances. Tripp claimed, to anyone who would
listen, that she had been transferred from the White House because she
``knew too much about Whitewater,'' a patent lie.
Commenting on the role of Tripp as the linchpin in the latest
Clintongate assault, Lyndon LaRouche called on Jan. 22 for Tripp's
security clearances to be immediately revoked, pending the outcome of a
thorough probe of her role in the sordid affair. ``She obviously needs
her security clearances immediately pulled, given her role in what has
all the earmarks of an illegal attack against the President, ostensibly
on behalf of partisan Republican forces. I would certainly hope that
there is no one in the Pentagon who would countenance such an obvious
assault against a vital American institution, the Presidency. I would
expect such treachery from the editorial page writers at the {Wall
Street Journal,} but not from our military.''
               - An earlier `eruption' -
In the summer of 1997, Tripp surfaced again as part of an effort to hit
President Clinton with a ``Profumo''-style sex scandal, telling
{Newsweek} that the President had sexually harassed a White House aide,
Kathleen Willey. Willey denied, under oath, that Tripp's allegations
were true. This prompted President Clinton's attorney, Robert Bennett,
belatedly, in August 1997, to denounce Tripp as a liar.
While working at the Pentagon, in late 1996, Tripp had already begun to
cultivate a close relationship with a former White House junior staff
aide, 22-year-old Monica Lewinsky, who had been recently transferred to
the Defense Department. It is unclear how the two women came to meet,
but in short order, Tripp began to exert a significant amount of control
over the younger woman. Tripp should be forced, under oath, to detail
the circumstance under which she met and befriended Lewinsky.
Tripp soon betrayed Lewinsky's confidence by surreptitiously--and,
probably, illegally--taping telephone conversations with Lewinsky.
By December 1997, Tripp and Lewinsky had {both,} mysteriously, been
subpoenaed to give depositions to attorneys for Paula Jones, in her
civil lawsuit against the President--a lawsuit instigated by British
intelligence operator and former London {Sunday Telegraph} Washington
correspondent Ambrose Evans-Pritchard. How Jones's attorneys came to
know of the existence of Tripp and Lewinsky is one question that may
hold a key to Tripp's role in the present attack against the President.
It should be recalled that, prior to being named the independent counsel
in Whitewater, Kenneth Starr had been paid by Richard Mellon Scaife,
through the Landmark Legal Foundation, to prepare an {amicus curiae}
brief in support of Paula Jones.
Tripp claims that, on Jan. 12, 1998, she took 20 hours of tape-recorded
conversations with Lewinsky to Whitewater Special Prosecutor Starr. The
next day, Starr arranged for Tripp to secretly tape her meeting with
Lewinsky at the Ritz Carlton Hotel near the Pentagon in Arlington,
At the time that Starr arranged for the FBI to secretly tape the
Tripp-Lewinsky meeting, {he had absolutely no jurisdiction to probe
President Clinton's relationship to the former White House aide.}
Indeed, it is critical that a full-scale probe be conducted, to
determine whether Tripp, who was in league with Starr from 1995, was
taping her conversations with Lewinsky on her own, or, covertly, on
behalf of Starr. At minimum, Starr vastly overstepped his jurisdiction;
far more likely, he himself broke the law--along with Tripp--in a
flagrant attempt to entrap and destroy President Clinton.
                 - No U.S. precedent -
In the 200-year history of the American Presidency, there have been
occasional sexual scandals involving top government officials; however,
never has such a personal scandal brought down the chief executive.
There is only one country in the world where heads of government are
brought to their knees through such tabloid scandal-mongering: Great
Britain. In 1963, Harold Macmillan's government was brought down by a
sex scandal involving Defense Minister John Profumo.
It is, therefore, not surprising that a review of the various
Clintongate scandals, from the 1993 so-called ``Troopergate'' affair to
the present attack, reveals that British intelligence stringer and
former {Sunday Telegraph} Washington correspondent Ambrose
Evans-Pritchard has been the chief instigator. As early as May 8, 1994,
in a {Sunday Telegraph} column, Evans-Pritchard boasted that he had been
instrumental in getting Paula Jones to file her civil suit against the
Evans-Pritchard has elsewhere boasted that his assignment, on behalf of
the British Crown's Hollinger Corporation, has been nothing less than
the total destruction of the Clinton Presidency. Writing in the Jan. 22
{Daily Telegraph,} Evans-Pritchard loudly bragged of his manipulation of
Paula Jones: ``My impression after befriending her four years ago,
before she took the momentous step of suing the President, is that her
motive was sheer rage.''
``Paula Jones has now achieved her object of inflicting massive damage
on Bill Clinton, with shortening odds that she may ultimately destroy
his Presidency,'' he continued. Evans-Pritchard accuses the U.S. news
media of covering up the Clinton sex scandals, so that only the
{American Spectator} or the British press will print the stories. ``What
Paula Jones has done is to use the immense power of legal discovery to
force the scandal to the surface. She has finally done the job that the
American media failed to do so miserably.''
This was precisely the strategy that Evans-Pritchard had laid out in
1994, when he acknowledged on May 8, 1994, that he had had ``a dozen
conversations with Mrs. Jones over the past two months.'' He furthermore
admitted that ``I happened to be present at a strategy meeting last
month on a boat on the Arkansas River,'' at which Jones's attorney ``was
weighing the pros and cons of legal action.''
It doesn't ``matter all that much whether Mrs. Jones ultimately wins or
loses her case,'' he wrote on May 15, 1994. ``The ticking time bomb in
the lawsuit lies elsewhere, in the testimony of other witnesses.''
``Put plainly,'' Evans-Pritchard blurted, ``the political purpose of the
Jones lawsuit is to reconstruct the inner history of the Arkansas
Governor's Mansion, using the legal power of discovery. In effect, the
two lawyers and their staff could soon be doing the job that the
American media failed to do during the election campaign and have
largely failed to do since.''
Evans-Pritchard's motive, in contrast to Jones's ``sheer rage,'' is a
deep, abiding hatred of the United States, and particularly, the
institution of its Presidency. Anyone who joins Evans-Pritchard in this
unfolding assault upon the Presidency, is joining the ranks of traitor
Aaron Burr.
A thorough probe of the current insurrection, beginning with a spotlight
on Linda Tripp, is more than appropriate.

     Do you want to end your money pressures forever?
     Do you want to double your income?
     Do you want to build an extra stream of income quickly?
If you answered yes, then let me show you how you can begin living your dreams, this year before it's too late.  I'll get right to the point.
As it says on the letterhead, my name is Robert Allen.  I'm famous for My two  New York Times best-selling books.  Nothing Down and Creating Wealth in America.

it's much easier and far less risky.  It involves:
-No employees
-Little risk
-Little start up cash
-It's so simple, anyone can do it

Dear Friend:

      ''Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your
        home  for an  investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars  expense one
        time''
        THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
       ===============================================
       BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR !!
       Before you say ''Bull'' , please read the following. This is the
       letter you have  been  hearing about on the news lately. Due to the
       popularity of this letter on the internet, a national  weekly news
       program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of
       this program described below , to see if it really can make people
       money.
       The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.
       Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely
       NO.  Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people
       can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make
       some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''.
        DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT         THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING         BETTER THAN EVER.
        This is what one had to say:
       ''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached
         many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad

THE US 'ANNOUNCED' THEIR INTENTION TO USE B61-11 BUNKER BUSTERS ON LAST
NIGHT'S NEWS BULLETINS (BUT SOMEHOW FORGOT TO REFER TO THE FACT THAT THEY
ARE CLASSIFIED AS TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS)
2:00 a.m. Oct. 8, 2001 PDT
Following the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon,
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was questioned on ABC television's This
Week program about the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons in the
expected conflicts to come. In practiced Pentagonese, Rumsfeld deftly avoided answering the question
of whether the use of tactical nuclear weapons could be ruled out. Though large "theater" thermonuclear devices -- doomsday bombs -- don't
fit the Bush administration's war on terrorism, smaller tactical nukes do
not seem out of the question in the current mindset of the Defense
Department. The most likely candidate is a tactical micro-nuke called the B61-11, an
earth-penetrating nuclear device known as the "bunker buster." The B61-11 was designed to destroy underground military facilities such as
command bunkers, ballistic missile silos and facilities for producing and
storing weapons.

I'm really skeptical about this - handguns are generally banned in Brazil, so it seems really unlikely that they'd suddenly be permitted aboard airlines - a policy change that radical and that fast seems too good to be true.
I searched on Yahoo's Brazilian news - see  looking for "pistola" or "revolver" and couldn't find any mention of the change, though I did find some news stories about local shootings, and about how some US residents are buying guns because of the WTC attacks.

When the FBI guys come knocking, it's the worst of times
By Riad Z. Abdelkarim
    The  ring  at  my  doorbell  that Sunday afternoon was
    innocent enough. I set aside my laptop computer and my
    half-eaten Chicken McNuggets and went to the door.
    When  I  first  peered out and saw two sharply dressed
    men in business suits and dark sunglasses, I thought I
    was  being  visited  by  a  pair of friendly Jehovah's
    Witnesses.
    As I opened the door, however, it struck me that these
    men  were  a bit older than the young men of faith who
    usually canvassed the neighborhood.
    Any   lingering   doubt  about  their  identities  was
    immediately  erased  when  the  two  men flashed their
    badges  and  announced  --  in true X-Files fashion --
    that   they   were   with   the   Federal   Bureau  of
    Investigation.
    "What can I do for you gentlemen?" I asked.
    My  initial  puzzled  reaction  turned to concern when
    they  explained  that  they  wanted  to  speak with me
    "about   the   events   of  last  Tuesday,"  obviously
    referring  to  the  horrible terrorist attacks against
    the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
    I  told  them that I would be happy to speak with them
    if  they  made  an appointment to meet me later at the
    local   office  of  the  Council  on  American-Islamic
    Relations,  where I served as a member of the board of
    directors.
    Although  the  agents  were somewhat taken aback by my
    request,  they  ultimately  agreed. An appointment was
    made  for  the following evening, but the agents never
    appeared   to  interview  me  nor  did  they  call  to
    reschedule the meeting.
    The next morning, I awoke ill and asked that my clinic
    patients be rescheduled before stepping out to pick up
    some over-the-counter medication.
    During  this  time,  two  other agents visited both my
    home  and work place. When the agents did not find me,
    they  warned  my  wife ominously that they "would keep
    coming back."
    I  was  finally  able  to  reach  one of the agents by
    cellular  phone, and I made an appointment to meet him
    and his partner at a local coffee shop.
    What  ensued can best be described as a combination of
    a    fishing   expedition   and   a   scene   from   a
    straight-to-video B-movie.
    Holding  a  thin  folder  stamped "SECRET" in front of
    them,   the  agents  initially  queried  me  about  my
    background.  One  of  them  stopped in mid-sentence to
    change  a  question  from  "When  did  you come to the
    U.S.?" to "Where were you born?"
    They  appeared  somewhat  surprised when I mentioned I
    was born in Santa Monica, California, and had lived in
    Southern California my entire life.
    I  was then quizzed about my political views with such
    vague  questions  as  "Are  we  the  bad  guys in this
    thing?"  I  told the agents in no uncertain terms that
    there  could  be  no  justification whatsoever for the
    horrible terrorist attacks that had taken place.
    Further,  I  informed them that my political views are
    widely  known  because I frequently write commentaries
    that  are  published in newspapers around the country.
    In  fact, in the days following the terrorist attacks,
    my commentaries condemning the assaults and expressing
    the  shared  grief and outrage of American Muslims had
    appeared   in   newspapers   in   California,   Texas,
    Connecticut, Washington, D.C., New Jersey, and Madrid,
    Spain.
    The  agents  subsequently  inquired  about my numerous
    affiliations   with   several   prominent  and  widely
    respected   American   Muslim   advocacy   and  relief
    organizations.  At  no  time  was  I  asked  about any
    specific  individual,  nor was I asked to identify any
    suspects in photographs.
    The  interview's  low  point came when I asked why the
    agents had gone to my clinic, when I had provided them
    with  a  cellular telephone number at which I could be
    reached.
    Their  answer  spoke  volumes about the aimlessness of
    this investigation:
    "When  we  learned  that you were out sick, we thought
    that our worst fears had been realized -- that you had
    fled the country."
    I could no longer restrain my laughter.
    "Give me a break," I exclaimed incredulously.
    To  where  would  I  flee?  I am an American. I do not
    possess nor do I desire any other citizenship.
    By  the  end  of the 75-minute ordeal, I was convinced
    that  the  agents  were  not  acting  on  any specific
    information but were instead groping wildly for straws
    in the dark.
    I found this quite disheartening.
    I   harbor   no  ill  will  toward  those  agents  who
    interviewed   me.   I  realize  that  they  were  just
    following orders. Like other Americans who are Muslims
    or  of Arabic ethnicity, I earnestly support the FBI's
    attempts   to   vigorously  investigate  this  heinous
    terrorist act and bring those responsible to justice.
    What  I  do  not  appreciate  is being singled out for
    questioning  merely  because of my faith, my ethnicity
    or my legitimate political activism.
    As noted in a Christian Science Monitor editorial this
    week,  "to have FBI agents with no preparatory contact
    knocking  on the doors of Arab or Muslim citizens with
    no  clear  ties  to  acts  of  crime  is a sure way to
    instill fear right where cooperation is most needed."
    In  legal  parlance,  this  practice is referred to as
    "profiling." In my book, it's just plain racism.
    And it has no place in my country.

    community. He lives in Southern California.

The California State Department of Fish and Game is advising hikers,
hunters, fishermen and golfers to take extra precautions and keep alert for
bears while in the Yosemite and Mammoth areas. They advise people to
wear noise-producing devices such as little bells on their clothing to alert
but not startle the bear unexpectedly. They also advise carrying pepper
spray in case of an encounter with a bear.
It is also a good idea to watch for fresh signs of bear activity and
know the difference between black bear and grizzly bear droppings.
Black bear droppings are smaller and contain berries and possibly squirrel
Grizzly bear droppings have little bells in them and smell like pepper

            Eighth Asian Computing Science Conference
                       Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, India
                      December 10-13, 2003
              Collocated with ICLP'03 and FSTTCS'03
                 ****** SUBMISSION DEADLINE EXTENDED TO AUGUST 11, 2003******
The phenomenal success of the Internet at the application level may
perhaps primarily be attributed to a few simple but powerful ideas: a
client-server computing model, stateless (or partially stateful)
protocols (such as SMTP, HTTP, Instant Messaging and Presence
Protocols), the separation of transport from content, etc.  Fundamental
limitations of these ideas are already being addressed by the
development of middleware platforms for distributed applications (e.g.,
J2EE, Groove, Jini, .Net).  In the future, experience with large-scale
distributed applications may result in well-understood computational
models that are enshrined in programming languages with support for
uniform naming, reflexive operation, fault tolerance, distribution,
locality, partially disconnected operation, persistence, mobility,
autonomic operation, spatial aggregation, continuous streaming, etc.
The theme of this conference is PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES and DISTRIBUTED
COMPUTATION.  Papers are invited on all aspects of theory, practice and
applications related to this theme.  Papers targeting lessons learnt
from the development of large-scale application frameworks (e.g.,
Internet applications, distributed sensor networks) that may serve as
the basis for the development of programming languages are particularly
  - Programming languages for distributed computation
  - Distributed capability-based computing
  - Grid computing
  - Peer-to-peer computing
  - Static analysis and type systems
  - Provably secure distributed computing
  - Proof-carrying code
  - Persistence in distributed computation
  - Language implications for
        Trust management / Reputation management /
        Public-key infrastructure
  - Language aspects of Internet middleware
  - Web services
  - Programming models for:
        Distributed sensor networks / Epidemic algorithms /
        Real-time streaming and querying
  - Model-based methods for distributed systems
  - Modeling of distributed systems
  - Large-scale distributed applications:
        Distributed MUDs / Distributed gaming environments /
        Electronic communities / Distributed collaboration environments

  The series of annual Asian Computing Science Conferences (ASIAN) was
  initiated in 1995 by AIT, INRIA and UNU/IIST to provide a forum for
  researchers in computer science from the Asian region and to promote
  interaction with researchers from other regions. The first seven
  conferences were held, respectively, in Bangkok, Singapore,
  Kathmandu, Manila, Phuket, Penang, and Hanoi. In addition to support
  from the host countries, they have also been sponsored by INRIA,
  France, UNU/IIST, Macau and NUS, Singapore. The proceedings have
  been published as Lecture Notes in Computer Science by
  Springer-Verlag.

Efforts at an out of court settlement having failed, the issue between
Adam Kosmin and Toshiba will at some unknown date be tried in a court of
law.  The case may be tried on Monday 30 June 2003, but the court might
rather set yet another date some time in the future, perhaps a month from
now.  So far Adam Kosmin and Toshiba have been out to the Queens County
courthouse three times.  This Monday's appearance will be the fourth in
this matter.
Adam Kosmin has written an important article on Refund Day II and what we
can do to help the courts and the press and the people understand:
At 5:00 pm on Monday 30 June 2003 Adam Kosmin and some tribesfolk will
gather at the coffee house across the street from the Queens County
courthouse.  All supporters of free software and all students of contract
law are invited!
If the case is heard this Monday, it might be useful to have on hand more
than one laptop computer running a free OS.  As always, Knoppix, or Knoppix
variant, disks are welcome.  These tools may help us explain to the judge
some facts that are not often presented in large circulation newspapers.
If convenient, wear standard CLOTHES OF RESPECT.  Do not interrupt or shout
out in court.  You may not read in court.  You must sit and pay attention
and be ready to help the judge and Adam.
Here is information about Refund Day I:
Adam Kosmin is the leader of Refund Day II and all questions should be
addressed to him at

For more about Refund Day II:
This action is not the whole of Refund Day II.  It is just the beginning.
Already other actions, not yet public, are in process.  No matter what
happens in court we will continue the fight.  What is at stake is our right
to private ownership of computers and our right to free private, tribal,
business, and public use of the Net.

And then too, of course, the "dramatic demonstration" from
SAN DIEGO - October 31, 2003 -- Satellite Security Systems (S3), a global
provider of asset security and logistics control, in cooperation with the
California Highway Patrol (CHP) and InterState Oil Company, dramatically
demonstrated the first wireless remote shutdown of a fully loaded moving
petrochemical tanker truck.
site - satellite communications were used to disable the truck in seconds,
proving S3's GlobalGuardT and FleetGuardT a viable solution to the challenge
of controlling rogue hazardous waste vehicles that could pose a threat to
homeland security.
The event, conducted on CHP Academy grounds in Sacramento and administered
by the CHP, addresses ongoing concerns about the affordability of effective
security technology, stealthiness of such a security device, and how GPS
monitoring can be incorporated safely into law enforcement protocol.

4 Jewish Web sites deemed 'terrorist'
By Jerry Seper
THE WASHINGTON TIMES
Four Internet Web sites operated by two extremist Jewish groups have
included by the State Department on its list of "foreign terrorist
organizations"  the first time the list has been extended to include
Internet sites.
     The four Web sites are:  and  the department said in a notice in the Federal
Register. They offer news, commentary and links to other sites of
interest to
followers of Meir Kahane.
The impact of the listing was not immediately clear, since all four
exist in cyberspace.
The designation makes it illegal for persons in the United States to
money or other material support to the Web sites. The three accessible
yesterday included information on where contributions could be sent,
items could be donated and offered a number items for sale, including
pendants and books.

The collection of concurrences on the merits are quite interesting.  The Chief's opinion adopts the SG's argument -- darn-near-preposterous, IMHO (and that of Justice Thomas!) -- that the Pledge is OK in schools because "under God" is "not endorsement of any religion," but instead "a simple recognition of the fact [that] '[f]rom the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.'"    Justice Thomas concludes -- correctly, in my view, see  -- that if Lee v. Weisman was correctly decided, then public schools may not lead students in daily recitation of the words "under God."  Thomas, however, would overrule Lee.

Yes.  This is one of the technologies used on the Pentium D:
It embeds a private key in each CPU.  The key cannot be directly
extracted, only used for signature and decryption operations.  The
idea is that your computer receives encrypted data from the set-top
box, and can route it to a variety of other targets---but it's always
encrypted when it leaves.  So that might include other PCs in your
home, or a television, or a monitor, or a storage device.  It even
works over IP, counting hops to ensure it doesn't leave your home.
There is a similar technology by Macrovision which appears to also be
So does it *contain* DRM?  Well, if DRM is policy, no.  Does it
contain content-protection technology?  Absolutely.  Does it contain
technology to help restrict you from using media you purchased in
accordance in fair and legal ways?  Yes.

@_subject: private vs. public tor network ... any other options ? 
If you limit yourself to a small set of nodes, you
will definitely compromise your anonymity against a powerful attacker. But
what if you're not worried about a powerful attacker, or serious anonymity?
What if you just want a casual observer to think you're using Tor, and leave
it at that?
You could run two relays on each node you control. One relay would be part
of the public tor network, and limit the bandwidth to a (large) fraction of
what you have available. One relay would be part of your private tor network
and use the rest of the available bandwidth. You'd have to bootstrap your
tor network from scratch, and set up an authority, and so on. Then you could
run your local tor client on your private network, and have a small set of
fast nodes available to you. A casual observer at either end (you-hop1 or
hop3-internet) would see the traffic from/to a tor node, and assume that it
was truly torified. Depending what you personally think the threat profile
is - and I'd suggest reading some of the research to find out what threats
to consider - you might want to use an entry point or exit node on the
regular network, or do other circuit manipulation.
Note that trying to take advantage of your own resources inevitably limits
your anonymity potential. Customizing your network also means that you won't
benefit as much, or at all, from upgrades to Tor. However, if all you want
is casually anonymous browsing at high speed, this may be useful to you.
Nonetheless, I make no guarantees that the system you set up will be
sufficiently anonymous for you.
