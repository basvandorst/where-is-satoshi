Soldiers test `Digital MP System'
by Trish Warrick
FORT POLK, La. (Army News Service, Nov. 13, 2000) Military Police could see
around corners, through trees and in the dark as they tested the Army's new
"Digital MP System" this month at Fort Polk, La.
Patrolmen wore eyeglass-mounted miniature cameras providing "streaming
video" to their partners. Viewing screens in the eyeglasses also allowed
the MPs to check the faces of suspects they stopped against digital mug
shots of known offenders.
Fort Polk's 91st Military Police Detachment soldiers became the first MPs
to test the system Oct. 30 to Nov. 3. Representatives of the U.S. Army
Soldier Systems Center in Natick, Mass., brought the Digital MP System to
Fort Polk. They were joined by members of the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency and a number of contractor teams wanting to see how the
system would work on real soldiers.
The Digital MP is a durable, lightweight, wearable communications and
information management system designed to help carry out reconnaissance,
checkpoint security, anti-terrorism operations and other MP missions, said
program manager Henry Girolamo, Natick Soldiers Center.
The backbone of the Digital MP is a wearable computer developed by ViA
Inc., MicroOptical Corp and Honeywell Inc. and tailored to the mission
requirements of the MP soldier, Girolamo said. The Digital MP's support
features include a hands-free, voice-operated interface and a battery that
provides day-long power on a single charge. It features peripherals such as:
*  An audiovisual system with built-in miniature camera for face
recognition and image display plus a noise-cancelling microphone and
bone-conduction microphone/earphone for voice recognition, all incorporated
in a pair of normal-size eyeglass frames
*  A BDU-pocket-sized "military e-book" readable even in strong sunlight or
pale starlight (with night vision goggles) that emits no light to give away
a soldier's position
*  An electronic glove that can function like a computer mouse with the
e-book and translate hand signals into words on other soldiers'
eyeglass-mounted viewers
The Digital MP system can connect a military police team wirelessly and in
ways never before possible, officials said.
The eyeglass-mounted camera provides streaming video, which means "it can
transmit to me what another MP is looking at even though I can't see him,"
said Sgt. Michael Sauer, Special Reaction Team noncommissioned officer in
charge, 91st MP Det.
An MP making a traffic stop or manning a checkpoint can take live videos
which are checked against digital mug shots stored in the National Crime
Interdiction Center database, Sauer said, so he's quickly alerted if the
person stopped has a criminal record. On deployment, the system can warn
him that he's dealing with a suspected terrorist or war criminal.
An MP on patrol can use the e-book to quickly help others locate what he
sees. "Say he's on recon, looking at the terrain," said Sauer. "He sees
enemy tanks." Using traditional methods, the soldier plots coordinates on a
paper map, calls the TOC on the radio and another soldier plots the
coordinates on another map. With Digital MP, "He puts the icon on the map
and sends it to the operations center," Sauer said.
With the electronic glove, MPs separated by thick woods, buildings or
darkness can still communicate silently with the familiar hand signals for
"Suspect armed!" and other vital information.
The adapted Nomex flight glove, with bend sensors in each finger and in the
wrist, pressure sensors in the index and middle fingertips and 2-degree
tilt sensors, renders preprogrammed gestures as words in fellow MPs'
eyeglass display monitors. The glove works when the signaler doesn't have
line of sight communication with the others and doesn't want to give away
his position by speaking, said Sauer.
The glove also functions like a mouse with the e-book, guiding the cursor
with the tilt sensor and using the pressure sensors as right and left
clicks. When silence is necessary, as on patrol, the glove can override the
voice-operated system.
The Digital MP can be programmed to continuously translate speech from
English to another language and vice versa with only a five-second lag.
Presently it can handle Spanish, Korean, Arabic, German, French, Italian,
Portuguese, Dutch, Thai and Turkish, and officials said they plan to add
"militarese" -- translating the soldier's "clicks" into the civilian's
"kilometers," for instance.

For Some, Intercepting Spy
Transmissions Is Just a Hobby
By Michael Della Bitta    FOXNews.com
   Spending nights intercepting spy agencies' secret transmissions may
sound like an exciting career. But for shortwave enthusiast Chris
Smolinski, it's just a hobby. Smolinski and others tune in to numbers stations broadcasts � instructions
for deployed secret agents encoded into a sequence of numbers and read
aloud on shortwave radio.
Listening to a long string of numbers read over the radio may sound like
dullsville, but Smolinski disagrees. "They may think it's a waste of time,
but then they probably spend 30 hours a week watching sitcoms on TV."
Shortwave Subculture
What started as a fringe hobby for those exploring the frontiers of
shortwave radio in solitude has become a group effort, thanks to the
"It made it possible for hobbyists to rapidly exchange information with
each other. Now someone can hear a station, and alert others in real-time,
so they can tune it in, rather than reading about it months from now,"
Smolinski said.
Smolinski runs an Internet mailing list called Spooks, named after the
slang word for an undercover agent. The mailing list, along with
Smolinski's Web site, is a clearinghouse for the observations of fellow
hobbyists, who can jump online and share their observations with each other.
And the subject of their observations is somewhat baffling. Every night,
the shortwave spectrum of radio is peppered with mysterious,
androgynous-sounding announcers who chant numbers in a monotone voice.
Many times the broadcast is introduced by an eerie piece of music that
identifies the particular station to those in the know. And since shortwave
signals bounce off the atmosphere and the surface of the Earth, sometimes
they can be heard from across the planet.
Listeners first noticed the stations during the beginning of the Cold War,
but didn't know what they were for. To this date, no government has
admitted to the purpose of these broadcasts or even to running the stations
that send them.
It wasn't until the '70s that the source and purpose of the stations
started becoming common knowledge.
Shortwave listeners, by comparing their observations, have traced some of
these signals back to their source. Most of them come from known military
installations of the world's governments.
The numbers stations are generally understood to be coded transmissions of
instructions from the intelligence agencies of the world's governments to
their undercover agents deployed in other countries.
So why are spy agencies using low-tech shortwave radio to get word out to
their agents? "The thought is that it is normal to have a small portable
radio that tunes shortwave, so possession isn't incriminating," Smolinski
"If the agent were caught with James Bond-type sophisticated gear, it would
be pretty obvious he's a spy," he added.
Smolinski estimates some numbers listeners spend over 20 hours a week
practicing their hobby. Some postings to the Spooks list include logs of
hundreds of different stations caught in the act by listeners.
Unfortunately, listeners will never know the meanings of the mysterious
messages. They're encoded using something called a one-time-pad, which is
unbreakable unless you're in possession of a matching codebook to the one
that was used to scramble the message. And agents are trained to destroy
each page of their code book once used, hence the moniker "one-time."
But for Smolinski, the hobby still has rewards. For one, tuning in the
faint stations requires a little more shortwave-listening mettle than
tuning in the BBC, for example.
And by coordinating with fellow listeners, the Spooks list and other groups
of its ilk have managed to figure out who runs many of the stations and
their probable purpose.
For example, Spooks members have noted increased broadcasts from stations
run by the Mossad � the Israeli version of the CIA � during times when
conflict flares in the Middle East.
And listeners have determined that broadcasts from American stations on
this continent are usually read in Spanish � and thought to be aimed at
Cuba. Of course, Cuba is believed to run stations of its own.
A change in the regular pattern of broadcasts will often spark a
speculative thread on the Spooks list. Did equipment fail? Was it some CIA
agent's first day? Was that Latin beat underneath the latest broadcast
interference, or just some Cuban agent listening to the radio?
Spies are a mysterious bunch.
