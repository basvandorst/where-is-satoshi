Believe it or not, something like this is being used (or is being prepared
for use) in breast implants.  An article in the Houston (silicone city)
Chronicle about a month ago (sorry, I can't produce a more exact reference)
stated that new soybean oil breast implants are being manufactured to
accept an identification device to track information on the patient and the
implanting doctor.
It's not exactly big brother (bigger sister?) but it's the first
human-implanted ID device that I've heard of.  I don't know if any have
actually been implanted.

@_subject: Mondex and currency exchange (Was: An article for Wired magazine) 
Pardon me for being behind; I'm catching up with 1500 cypherpunks
articles...  I was skimming and came upon the following:
JM> Mondex in the UK currently has official government units of account
JM> digitally represented for their Mondex card trial in Swindon.  They
JM> have also announced that in the future this card will hold up to five
JM> "official" currencies.
I'm not sure how Mondex works, but if currency conversion is made easy
doesn't this have an interesting effect on the currency markets?  If I can
have my machine follow micro changes in the markets and convert my money
around instantaneously without going through a middle-man then things could
get interesting.  Then again, I'm really nieve when it comes to currency
Please show me the flaw here.
