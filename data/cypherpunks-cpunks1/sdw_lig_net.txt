@_subject: Copyright enforcement through crypto 
I'd like to explore the technical problems of enforcing copyright restrictions through encryption and custom viewing software.
What I have in mind is a viewer, say a spin off of Mosaic, that has
a general purpose decryption engine that could be programmed with an
algorythm as part of the document download process.  The goal I have
in mind is to make possible one time, or limited time viewing of a
downloaded document  The document would be encrypted with the selected
method and keyed with a timestamp.  The client would need access to a
timeserver and a session key, etc. to decrypt as close as possible to
the display hardware.
This could be prototyped as a user process, but securely implemented
as an extension to X, MS-Windows, etc.
I haven't worked out all the problems, but see quite a few already.
Obviously, the goal would be to get really good copyright material on
the net, like first run movies, when we have the bandwidth.
Just wondering what minimum collection of hardware, software, and
infrastructure would be needed.  Of course, this is related to the
pay-per-use software paradigm (vs. current unlimited license).

@_subject: Copyright enforcement through crypto 
Yesyes, you're preaching to the choir.  I want information to be free
too, etc.
It just occurred to me that by tying the decryption to a time server
and sending both the timebased key and a complete algorithm to a general purpose engine that you might get something somewhat effective.
To give an example:
12 years ago I worked in a computer store that sold Atari computers.
I learned to program on my Atari 400, cassete, Basic, assembly, etc.
I used to have fun 'breaking' the copy protection on game floppies.
There were some sophisticated methods that a number of companies used,
but I could eventually disassemble and follow the code and patch it.
(Blue Max was the hardest I cracked: 5 stage load, several
multi-sector-with-same-number-same-track protections, and executing
code merged from two such sectors).
The one disk that I couldn't crack (and I still have it) was the ABC
Basic compiler.  The compiler was compiled with itself.  Since the
assembly was just a general purpose engine, I had to follow the
p-code/tokenized Basic all over the place.  I could never keep track
of it long enough to solve it.
If an algorithm is only good for a perticular copy of a document and
only for a short time, the theoretical possibility of cracking it
becomes harder.
I want to explore what aspects can be solved and what can't.
Obviously you can always take a picture of the screen, possibly
capture data in the window/operating system, etc.  But, with
a modifed X, unmodified OS, etc., how close can you get.
Unless each document uses it's own key and randomly selected
algorithm(s) and needs online access.
Of course, that's always a problem, unless things are priced per use
so that it's more attractive to pay.
Of course, I didn't say it was necessary...  Just musing how effective
it would be.
I agree.
Come on guys, I don't post that much, but you need to crank up your
Devil's Advocate detectors.  Geesh, doesn't anyone like a good

I would like some summary opinions of the state of various efforts to

After playing with ssh, I've been thinking of what it would take to
start migrating certain links to full encryption, possibly using a
VPN-like arrangement.
I'm interested in hacking Linux, loopback userspace drivers for other Unix's,
and thinking about what would need to be done for MS-BLECH.  Of course,
firewall like conversion of IP<->IPng6 would be great.
Of course now that Linux has IP aliasing, IP masquerading (partial I think),
ipfw, and IP over IP tunneling, it has much of what it needs.  I'm just
considering development and migration paths.
I haven't kept up on IPng6 docs, so succinct pointers would be helpful.
One interesting tact might be to start running a dual IPng6/IP stack
where it learns to tunnel packets over a well-known IP udp/tcp link
if an address doesn't respond to IPng6.

Not only that but it's common now for DNS servers to give short TTL
for the answers (multiple A recs for load balancing), no big deal

I believe the root servers answers for intermediate nodes are cached
normally, so key.george.bub.com doesn't cause a root hit after
bub.com has been resolved.
Quite a few domains do run their own name servers, and it's not too tough
to create auto-update scripts, etc.
There's no reason that DNS has to be the only mechanism.  Default
to one method then fallback to others, like direct IP port connection
for query.

It should have minimize bandwidth, minimize cpu, minimize storage
levels of service to allow different levels of users to have
different possible impact on the machine.  (Ie. : local, paying,

I know that those of us running Internet services would devote

Both of these could be modified fairly easily.
I think Twinsock (Troy's winsock, twnsck12.zip) would be the first

It also should tunnel through multiple telnets since by default it escapes

@_subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: Ssh (Secure Shell) remote login program 
I think we've all been waiting for / building this.
ssh, while an obvious name, already collides with a nice shar decoder and
a different kind of secure shell from CFS.
Probably a worthwhile collision though.
Second: It would be very helpful if the socket connection could be made (optionally)
through a telnet proxy for firewalls (with optional quoting of problem
characters).  I've actually done this with TERM and a helper program.
I may produce a patch for this.
Of course support for S/Key and tokens/hand held authenticators would be
useful additions for some situations (although inferior to RSA...).
Someone needs to crank out a Windows/Mac client... (Lower priority, but
still useful.)
udprelay etc. could also be borrowed from the term suite.
Integration with TCP/NFS and/or client-server CFS would be fantastic.
(One local CFS server acting as a secure client over tcp to a remote
CFS server.)

@_subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: Ssh (Secure Shell) remote login program 
I agree as the collisions aren't too bad (except in my /usr/local/bin...).
I was actually contemplating a modification to CFS to support a
tunneled TCP based NFS related operation.
CFS, like other specialized NFS servers, talks to NFS clients like
the normal NFS server, but runs on a different RPC port (so you can
run several types of NFS servers).  CFS encrypts directories that can be attached and detached without changing the NFS mount.
It occurred to me that it wouldn't be too tough to have one CFSD
open a TCP/socket connection to another CFSD and pass file access
requests instead of implementing them locally.  The encryption
of the ssh link and the on disk encryption of CFSD should be a good combination.
I've been compiling under Linux and have had a number of autoconfiguration
errors.  I'll produce a simple-minded patch shortly.
(Thinks I'm cross-compiling, have some include files I don't, don't
have waitpid/wait3, collision with stdc crypt/random defs, etc.)

That's true.  I was thinking in terms of traversing firewalls in a
safe fashion rather than where normal SUN/RPC NFS is available.
For this, using CFS and SSH together seems appropriate.

*** Help on ENCRYPT
Usage: ENCRYPT [| []]
  ENCRYPT allows you to hold an encrypted conversations with
  a person or a whole channel.  Once a nickname/channel and
  key is specified, all messages you send to that
  nickname/channel will automatically be encrypted using the
  given key.  Likewise, any messages from that nickname/channel
  will automatically be decrypted. ircII is smart enough to know
  if the incoming message isn't encrypted and will not attempt to
  decrypt it.  If you received an encrypted message from someone
  for whom you haven't specified a key, it will be displayed as
  [ENCRYPTED MESSAGE].
  The  can be any text which is to be used an they key
  for encryption/decryption of the conversation.  It is up to
  you and the people you wish to talk to about how to agree upon
  a key and how to communicate it to one another.
  For example, if user CheeseDog wishes to talk encryptedly with
  user DogCheese, they must first agree on an encryption key
  (case sensitive), say foo.  Then user CheeseDog must issue a
    ENCRYPT DogCheese foo
  and user DogCheese must issue a
    ENCRYPT CheeseDog foo
  Thereafter, all messages sent between CheeseDog and DogCheese
  will be encrypted and decrypted automatically.
  If ENCRYPT is given with a nickname but no key, then encrypted
  conversation is ended with that user.  If ENCRYPT is given with
  no arguments, the list of encrypted user and keys are
  displayed.
  IrcII uses a built in encryption method that isn't terribly secure.
  You can use another if you so choose, see SEE ENCRYPT_PROGRAM
  for information about this.
  If you are sending encrypted messages to a user or channel, you
  can toggle it off and on in a message line by inserting the
  control-E character in the input line.  This is usually done
  by hitting control-Q then control-E.  An inverse video E will
  appear in the input line.
  Control-q is bound (see BIND) to quote_character by default.
  It is frequently necessary to change this to some other char.
See Also:
  SET ENCRYPT_PROGRAM
*** You have new email.
*** No help available on encrypt_program: Use ? for list of topics
*** Help on ENCRYPT_PROGRAM
Usage: SET ENCRYPT_PROGRAM   Sets the program used to encrypt and decrypt messages.  The

In any case, using SIGIO is a whole parallel method to using a select loop,

has some elegance since they chain to other possible signal handlers in

That's not necessarily true:
I could setup a web server to only listen to a socket that a local ssh
socket proxy could connect to.  Restrict the ssh session for a particular
key to only allow connection to that one socket.  Then the connecting
party would need ssh running with socket proxy near(er) their client
system and the public key.
Assuming that you have a Unix workstation with audio listening software
or a nearby PC it would be easy to setup.

I have a neighbor that develops one of the commercial TCP/IP stacks, so
it's quite possible I could convince him to help.
With things like ssh, it's already very easy to create secure tunnels.
It wouldn't be too tough to modify a proxy to use ssh style connections
if an initial connection was found to be encrypted (or a key was cached
for a URL).
Of course, IPsec is coming...

By James Popkin, NBC News Senior Investigative Correspondent
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is reminding law-enforcement officials of the increased use of female suicide bombers worldwide, and warning that women terrorists might hide explosives in devices bthat mimic the look of a pregnant woman.b
The unclassified DHS threat assessment, released Monday and obtained by NBC News, shows photographs of bpregnancy prosthetics,b hollowed-out devices that could hold explosive devices. The report says bfemale suicide bombers have used devices that make them appear pregnant to hide explosive devices.b
The DHS report states that terrorists are using female bombers more frequently, in part because these attacks generate bmore widespread media exposure.b It adds: bContinued use of female suicide bombers-the most recent example being a 3 February 2008 attack at the main railway station in Colombo, Sri Lanka-indicates that terrorists judge this tactic as effective in increasing defenses and thwarting security measures.b
The report, marked bFor Official Use Only,b is one of dozens of threat assessments issued jointly throughout the year by DHS and the FBI. The authors are quick to mention that therebs no immediate threat to the U.S.
bDHS and the FBI have no specific, credible intelligence indicating that terrorist organizations intend to utilize female suicide bombers against targets in the Homeland,b they write.
The report ticks off several recent attacks by women bombers in Iraq and Sri Lanka, and the recruitment of female suicide bombers in Chechnya, India, Pakistan, the Palestinian territories and Turkey.
Why the increase in women bombers? bDHS and the FBI assess that female suicide bombers may have an advantage over their male counterparts in accessing targets. The means to conduct a suicide attack vary widely, but a key element in maximizing the lethality of a suicide bombing is the bomberbs ability to get close to the target,b the report states. bFemale suicide bombers may carry explosives devices in a backpack, briefcase, or purse, or hidden in an article of clothing worn close to the body, such as a vest, belt, long socks, or jacket.b

Can you write up a spec for that?  A few lines of code?
There are a couple main types of use cases for this kind of capability:
A) emergency situations of various types like the Egypt blackout and
B) getting communication and sharing working in more misc. ambient conditions (poor coverage in a building, on the train, etc.).
There is a big use case for this that will give it a workout that is sort of a simulation of the first of these and with a good need for the second: Burning Man.  Many people in a refugee-like camp, no commercial wireless or land line, a desire to communicate in various ways, a high percentage of techies with smart phones, all running an experiment for a week.  Seems like a perfect testing ground.  We have 6 months to be ready.

Chons - "Egyptian god of light in the night... he also held the titles Embracer, Pathfinder, and Defender, as he was thought to watch over night travelers. As the god of light in the night, Chons was invoked to protect against wild animals, increase male virility, and to aid with healing."
chons.org is now registered.  Now, how is it pronounced??
There has been plenty of work with open source cell networks, etc.  I haven't seen anything usable about hand-held mesh and/or store and forward capability yet.  Ideally, you'd use bluetooth when in close proximity, with Wifi / cell for uplink, with Wifi also being used for wider proximity connections.  The store and forward capability could be kind of cool.  Limit it to SMS-like messages, enforce flow control, then floodcast, possibly with fuzzy geo-routing, as necessary for both unicast and broadcast messages.  Get all roving vehicles to run store and forward nodes.  Include time synchronization, then implement radio control for prairie dog activation for both battery conservation and channel The biggest hurdle will be security, including detecting and defeating jamming and spoofing of various types.
I'm most interested in an Android solution that will work on most devices.  Not only are they easier to hack, more open, easier to run untrusted apps, etc., but some of us are building a collection of obsolete devices that would be cool to use for this.

@_subject: [FoRK] Decentralizing the Internet So Big Brother Canbt Find You 
I was really interested in Plug Computers a year or two ago, and I have a couple development units.  For this kind of application, it seems that a certain range of applications, like personal servers and remote access to archives, is obvious (and there is an "app plug computer" for that, about $100).  For really solving the decentralized problem, you'd want to pair it with mesh communications.  I see several possibilities.  Wifi-Wifi would be great, but there are antenna and power issues in many cases.  Wifi-cellphone-picocell is more interesting because cell phones already can make significantly more distance than typical WiFi.  This is also interesting if you add in resilient routing / store and forward / dynamic multi-modal addressing (including geo).  Ideally, you can cover any distance and gaps for at least some transmission, and great transmission when possible, by opportunistically hitching a ride on any device to any device proximity.
These devices (plug computers, smart phones, picocells, wifi base stations, bluetooth, zigbee) are inexpensive and low power enough that they could be just about everywhere.  Every vehicle, street light / signal, business, person, and even important street surfaces and similar could be wirelessed with an open, cooperative, protocol.  Doing it while controlling abuse and  making use fair is the problem.
The biggest hard problem is probably preventing bombing by e-signal.  Some possible solutions: A) blackout in appropriate conditions (hard to prevent abuse of) and B) super-tracing / persistent following after the fact when a bad event happens and enough people vote for extreme transparency.  In other words, detect the explosion or whatever, people hit the panic button, and every possible trigger is tracked back to a likely source and those sources are tracked for some time using all methods.
There are a number of obvious apps for this kind of network: shotspotter (a la Bump) for all devices.  Person-aware (what I mentioned yesterday a la traffic safety to prevent hitting children and animals in congested traffic areas).  Emergency service / help expediting.

Hollywood whodunit: What's eating emails in iCloud?
A reader in show biz writes in with a puzzle: His iCloud attachments aren't coming through -- perhaps by Apple's design
By Robert X. Cringely | InfoWorld
Here's a mystery worthy of a Hollywood thriller.
I recently got an email from a reader named Steven G., an Academy Award-winning developer of screenplay-writing software used by major movie honchos. Steven told me his customers had been encountering a bizarre issue with Apple's iCloud service.
[ Apple's control freak tendencies go back a long way. Witness: The 7 words you can't say on iTunes. | For a humorous take on the tech industry's shenanigans, subscribe to Robert X. Cringely's Notes from the Underground newsletter. | Get the latest insight on the tech news that matters from InfoWorld's Tech Watch blog. ]
A screenwriter was delivering a PDF attachment of a draft of his script to the project's director, by emailing it from his iCloud/MobileMe account to Gmail. The problem? The script would never arrive, no matter how many times he would send it. But sending other PDF documents worked fine.
I figured, wow -- is this some sort of spectacular failure of our screenwriting software (Movie Magic Screenwriter)? Our software had generated the PDF, so maybe we had accidentally generated information that was somehow matching the profile of a virus, or malware, causing the document to be rejected by Apple's mail servers.
After obtaining a copy of the PDF (sent via Gmail to our Microsoft Exchange server), we confirmed the exact same behavior when we tried to send it to our own iCloud mailbox. The email never arrived, nor did we receive any return notification.
He began experimenting to find out what was going on. First, he compressed the screenplay PDF into a Zip file and sent that. It also disappeared. Next, he compressed it using Apple's encrypted archive format. That attachment made it through, but it came with an unusual comment: "[not Virus Scanned]" appended to the subject field.
flagged and flushed. He cut the file in half and sent the first 59 pages as an attachment. It got deleted. His breakthrough arrived, in dramatic Hollywood fashion:
AND THEN I SAW IT -- a line in the script, describing a character viewing an advertisement for a pornographic site on his computer screen. Upon modifying this line, the entire document was delivered with no problem.
It seemed not only was Apple scanning messages for malware, it was also scanning the content of each attachment and exercising some kind of rule about it. Apple wasn't merely flagging the message or sending to a spam folder, but deleting it outright.

Surprised that works well without corruption...
Although for a whole drive it would be a bit of an efficient storage use issue (requiring just periodic reset maintenance), SparkleShare+Gitolite git server via ssh is a great combination, with clients for Windows/Macosx/Linux or you can use any git client.  If the git server were storing into a TrueCrypt loopback on the server, you'd ruin offline attacks against your data.  Simply sync to another drive somewhere to get Why not run an ephemeral VM (VirtualBox is free) that mounts a local host TrueCrypt volume that is a cache for SparkleShare/Git.  You could run the VM from the TrueCrypt volume, but then it would be mounted on the local OS and Panopticon-like admin / system software would get to it.  An ephemeral VM (that doesn't save updates to disk) that mounts the TrueCrypt volume is more difficult to attack. This was always a feature of VMWare; not sure how to do it with VirtualBox.  Perhaps with snapshots or similar COW drive  mounts with the drives in the TrueCrypt loopback.
The VM should tunnel all network traffic over SSH to a shell server somewhere, home if you properly setup incoming ports.  Use dynamic DNS to get to it or something simpler (file on the ssh server is enough).
It's not to hard to get the beginnings of cover traffic to make traffic analysis tough.  This could be done various ways from random data, traffic sensing reaction, to a smart tunnel that directly augments traffic patterns with chaff.  Modify netcat and then run that over SSH socket proxies.
I've been running a colocated machine one way or another since 1992, with my own DNS server, etc.  When I get around to building almost-never-fail mini-servers, I have at least two other stable but seldom visited locations to put servers.  I currently have an underused Linux box with 4 large drives and 10Mb symmetric unlimited use.  The hard drive wears out about once every 2 years; it gets rebooted about once every 6-12 months.  It would probably be a good idea to share it and defray some of the costs, especially while I'm in (relative) vow-of-poverty startup mode again.

Fox News' Audience Is Literally Dying: Is Roger Ailes' Grand Experiment in Propaganda Doomed?
There are certain demographic realities that can't be ignored.
April 17, 2013  |
The following article first appeared on the Nation. For more great content, sign up for their newsletter here.
In the annals of Fox News, October 2012 will likely stand out as a shining moment. Buoyed by a wave of Republican optimism about Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, the network seemed tantalizingly close to realizing one of its key ideological goals: ousting President Obama from the White House. Renewed enthusiasm among conservatives was, in turn, triggering record-high ratings for much of the network's programming and helping it to beat not just rival news competitors MSNBC and CNN during prime time, but every other TV channel on the cable dial. What's more, the prospect of an ascendant GOP come January meant Fox News might soon return to the era of access and prestige it enjoyed in Washington during the presidency of George W. Bush. The future looked so bright that News Corporation CEO Rupert Murdoch signed Fox News president Roger Ailes to a lucrative four-year contract extension, even though the 72-year-old Ailes's existing contract wasn't due to expire until 2013.
Then November arrived, and with it reality.
Fox News's shellshocked election night coverage, punctuated by Karl Rove's surreal meltdown upon hearing of Obama's victory in Ohio and, thus, the election, capped off a historic day of reckoning for the network and conservatives alike. Chastened by defeat, Republican politicians and right-wing pundits have subsequently been grappling with the repercussions of the caustic tone and incendiary rhetoric their movement has adopted. This ongoing debate about whether broadening conservatism's appeal  requires new messages or just new messaging has ignored the 800-pound gorilla in the room, however. Noticeably absent from all the right wing's public self-criticism is any interest in confronting the potent role played by the Republican Party's single most important messenger, Fox News.
Standing at the epicenter of the networkband any new Republican Party groundswellbis Ailes. A former political operative of President Richard Nixon, Ailes has inextricably intertwined his professional and political pursuits since founding Fox News in 1996. Indeed, the network chief functions as a kind of proxy kingmaker within the party, frequently meeting with Republican politicians to offer strategic advice. He is a regular confidant of Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, and at various times, he (or a network emissary of his) has counseled 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Gen. David Petraeus on their potential future. "Ailes," says former Reagan White House economic adviser Bruce Bartlett, "is quite open about offering his free advice to Republicans.... If you visit New York City, you go see Roger Ailes and kiss his ring. It's like visiting the Vatican. My guess is that there's a lot of back-and-forth between Ailes and whoever is at the pinnacle of power in the Republican Party."
To keep relying on a shrinking number of elderly, white and male subsets of the public, whether to win elections or win ratings, has become a strategy of diminishing returns, however. "I think that you can't separate the problem at Fox [News] from the problem that the Republicans are going through," Bartlett says. He can speak firsthand to this incestuous relationship, as his 2006 book, Impostorbwhich broke with party orthodoxy over the Bush administration's deficit spendingbquickly made him persona  non grata at Fox News, he says. (Fox News did not respond to questions about his comment.) "The Republicans are trying to retool to win. That's all they care about, and they're trying to decide, 'How can we be more pragmatic? How can we shave off the rough edges? How can we get rid of the whack jobs who are embarrassing us, costing us Senate seats? But at the same time, we can't do this in such a way that it alienates our base.'" Fox News faces a similar dilemma, Bartlett contends: "It's 'How do we  modernize? How do we attract new audiences without losing the old audience? How do we remain relevant without abandoning our traditions?'"
These are fundamental questions, and lately Fox News's b(fundamentalsbaudience, ratings and public trustbhave faltered. A 2010  study by Steve Sternberg found the network's viewership to be the oldest (with an average age of 65) among an already elderly cable news audience. (CNN's was 63 and MSNBC's was 59.) By comparison, lifestyle cable channels Oxygen, Bravo and TLC were among the youngest, with an average viewer age of 42. And with MSNBC's recent decision to plug 34-year-old rising star Chris Hayes into the coveted b(8 pm slot, the average age of that network's prime-time hosts will now be 45, while Fox News's rotation, anchored by 63-year-old Bill O'Reilly, has an average age of 57.
Having cable news's oldest average age for both prime-time hosts and audiences represents something of a double-edged sword for Fox in the cutthroat world of cable TV. One advantage is that older audiences are traditionally more loyal, which is why several industry experts say that Fox News is unlikely to be dislodged from its perch atop overall cable TV news ratings anytime soon. This age-loyalty effect redounds to the benefit of Fox News's best-known prime-time hosts, Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly, as roughly two-thirds of their viewers are age 50 or older, according to a recent Pew State of the News Media survey.
But at the same time, there is an undeniable actuarial reality at workbor as Bartlett bluntly puts it, "Their viewership is quite literally dying." The most lucrative advertising dollars flow to TV shows that attract viewers "in the demo," short for "demographic"bindustry parlance for people ages 25 to 54. By contrast, Fox News's prime-time commercial breaks are blanketed with pitches for cheap medical devices and insurance companies aimed at retirees and the elderly. Perhaps not surprisingly, the network's advertising rates have grown at a much more modest pace in recent years, according to the Pew survey. Similarly, the growth of its ad revenues has diminished every year since 2008.
Because of the relatively older age and smaller size of the cable news audience, viewership tends to be relatively stable, says Columbia University Journalism School professor and former NBC News president Richard Wald. "Its [ratings] move in very small increments." To understand why viewers come and go, he compares a TV network's audience to a target with concentric rings. The core audiencebthose who are loyal to your channel and watch frequently (and, for partisan media outlets, those who are most ideologically compatible)bis the bull's-eye. Each concentric ring outward represents a segment of the audience that is less likely to watch because of diminished interest or less enthusiastic partisan sympathies. Dramatic ratings shifts can occur, but they tend to be driven by external events, like elections, rather than programming and thus affect all of the networks simultaneously. Most ratings fluctuations are statistical noise, Wald says, resulting from people in the outermost rings tuning in or out based on varying interest. "I would guess that [Fox News's] numbers could change by 5, 6, 7, 8 percent and not reflect a change in the loyalty of the But here, too, the news does not bode well. Though the network did retain its status as the top-rated cable news network in 2012bits eleventh consecutive year at number onebthe steep drop in ratings that its shows have experienced since Election Day has raised eyebrows, precisely because corresponding shows on MSNBC and CNN have not experienced the same precipitous decline.
Just how much of a drop are we talking about? According to Nielsen data, Fox News's prime-time monthly audience fell to its lowest level in twelve years in January among the 25-to-54 demographic. Daytime Fox News programming likewise saw its lowest monthly ratings in this age cohort since June 2008. Even the network's two biggest stars, O'Reilly and Hannity, have not been immune from viewer desertion: Hannity lost close to 50 percent of his pre-election audience in the final weeks of 2012, and  O'Reilly more than a quarter. The slide hasn't stopped in 2013, either. Compared with a year ago, O'Reilly's February prime-time ratings dropped b(26 percent in the coveted 25-to-54 demographic, his worst performance since July 2008. Hannity's sank even further, to the lowest point in his show's history.
As Wald points out, short-term ratings snapshots can be deceptive. But in the weeks following Obama's 2009 inauguration, Fox News's viewership actually surged, averaging 539,000 prime-time demo viewers versus 388,000 and 357,000 for CNN and MSNBC, respectively. This past January, however, Fox could only muster 267,000 average nightly viewersba 50 percent drop from that 2009 level, and not much more than MSNBC's 235,000 or CNN's So why are all these Fox News viewers tuning out? Some of the decline may be due to a broader cultural trend of people deciding to avoid cable TV news altogether. However, a recent Public Policy Polling survey of news media trustworthiness suggests there's more going on than public apathy. In February, PPP found a marked drop in Fox News's credibility. A record-highb(46 percent of Americans say they put no trust in the network, a nine-point increase over 2010. What's more, 39 percent name Fox News as their least-trusted news source, dwarfing all other news channels. (MSNBC came in second, at 14 percent.)
As might be expected, Fox News's credibility barely budged among liberals and moderates (roughly three-quarters of whom still distrust the network) and very conservative viewers (three-quarters of whom still trust it). However, among those who identified themselves as "somewhat conservative," the level of trust fell by an eye-opening 27 percentage points during the previous twelve months (from a net plusb47 percent  "trust" rating in 2012 to plusb20 percent now). Only a bare majority of center-right  conservatives surveyed by PPP say that Fox News is trustworthy.
"The people who are among the moderate-rights are actually the ones tuning out most," says Dan Cassino, a political science professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University who specializes in studying partisan psychology. Last May, Cassino conducted a survey that found Fox News's viewers were less informed about current political issues than those who watched no news at all. In response, the network's public relations team mocked FDU's college ranking in Forbes and belittled its student body as "ill-informed." This kind of ad hominem attack symbolizes the over-the-top, pugilistic messaging style of Ailes, whose no-holds-barred political instincts have dictated the network's direction since day one.
Ailes's foundational idea for Fox News, explains Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple, was to package this bias under the guise of "fair and balanced" news. "It is indeed the artifice of neutrality that makes so much of what they do objectionable, or not just objectionable but noteworthy," Wemple says. And it is effective, he adds: at a recent Value Voters conference, rock-ribbed conservatives almost involuntarily spouted the network's motto back at him when he asked them about Fox's coverage. It's a maddeningly clever bit of misdirectionbthe network whose branding is most identified with objectivity and accuracy is, in fact, anything but.
"Fox viewers are the most misled...especially in areas of political controversy," Chris Mooney writes in The Republican Brain, his 2012 book about the psychology of right-wing myths. The network's singularly corrosive impact on its viewers' understanding of reality, confirmed by numerous studies Mooney highlights in his book, is amplified by this "fair and balanced" motto, he says. It delegitimizes all other news media to create a vicious feedback loop within the right wing.
Thanks to its loyal conservative audience and its cozy relationship with the GOP leadership, Fox News has long been insulated from the consequences of its serial misinforming. "If your job is to say the most outrageous thing you possibly can and be rewarded for it, why shouldn't you?" Cassino points out. "As long as you get ratings, you're going to keep on doing it." But the recent erosion in ratings and cracks in the network's reputation, Cassino says, have created external pressure to make changes inside the network. (Neither Ailes nor anyone else at Fox News would comment when contacted for this story.)
Most notable among these post-election changes involved Fox News ridding itself of contributors Sarah Palin and Dick Morris and replacing them with former Congressman and left-wing gadfly Dennis Kucinich, former GOP Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts, and RedState.com editor in chief Erick Erickson. To some, this personnel turnover confirmed that Fox News was embracing a more intellectually honest, ideologically diverse worldview.
But there's less here than meets the eye. First of all, the impact an individual contributor can have on the network's overall nature is minimal; permanent hosts like O'Reilly and Hannity drive its day-to-day brand. And in the midst of the 2012 campaign, Ailes locked up O'Reilly and Hannity as well as news host Bret Baierbthe Fox News lineup from 7 through 10 pmball the way to 2016. What's more, one shouldn't read too much into the cashiering of Palin and Morris, since, by all accounts, they were terrible at their jobs: the former was criticized internally for being uncooperative with programming suggestions and personally disloyal to Ailes, while the latter was guilty of humiliating the network with his ridiculous election predictions (as well as auctioning off an unauthorized personal tour of Fox News' studios at a GOP fund-b(raiser). "They were only interested in  promoting themselves or perhaps promoting an ideology that may not win," says Bartlett, who singles out Palin's lack of substance for his harshest criticism. "Totally and professionally, she's the Lindsay Lohan of cable Indeed, Ailes's new hires are little more than new faces plugged into a well-worn programming strategy. Kucinich fills the slot of house liberal formerly occupied by Alan Colmes, serving as a handy foil for conservatives to shout at or over. The telegenic Brown, a blue-state Republican, endorses textbook anti-woman Republican policies, but does so without giving off an overtly extremist vibe. And die-hard conservative Erickson is there to reassure the Tea Partiers and the netrootsbsome of whom inexplicably believe that Fox News is drifting leftbthat they still have a voice on the Erickson is an interesting case. In February, not long after being hired by Fox, he posted a refreshingly frank essay complaining that the conservative media functions like an "echo chamber" that "peddle[s] daily outrage." Erickson, however, was careful not to include his new employer by name. Of course, selective indignation is something of a running theme for him. After accusing Supreme Court Justice David Souter of bestiality and pederasty in 2009, it took him almost a year to apologizebwaiting until after he took a prominent pundit gig at CNN. "Erick Erickson is obviously a whack job by the standards of a normal person," says Bartlett. "But within the ranks of the right-wing wacko universe, he is far closer to the center than, say, Sarah Palin, because at the bottom, he wants to win, see, where people like Sarah Palin don't give a fuck about winning."
Winning, famously, is what drives Ailes, and Rove as well. In the aftermath of the election, Fox instructed Rove to lie low for several weeks. But this benching didn't last long, and by mid-b(January the network had signed him to a new multi-year contract. Coincidentally, Rove launched a new project geared toward finding more electable candidates for 2014 just a few weeks later. But if the past is prologue, many of these future candidates won't be acceptable to fellow Fox commentator Erickson. "This is perfect grist for the sort of stuff Fox loves to do: 'Let's have a debate between somebody on the right and somebody on the far right,'" Bartlett explains. "That suits their agenda just fine."
In other words, the best interests of Fox News and those of the Republican Party, though inexorably connected, aren't always aligned. The currency of the former is ratings and of the latter, votes. "There's always a tension between the two," says Jonathan Ladd, political science professor at Georgetown University and author of the 2012 book Why Americans Hate the Media and How It Matters. But because the GOP relies so heavily on Fox News to reach its constituents and spread its message, the network exerts its own gravitational pull on the party. "If the Republican Party wants to make an ideological shift, if they want to modify their vision on immigration, say, it matters a lot if Fox commentators and management are willing to go along with that," Ladd points out.
Fox News clearly jumped out in front of the party on the immigration issue. Only two days after Obama's re-election, Hannity, a hardline opponent of undocumented immigrants, came out on his radio program (which is not affiliated with Fox News) in favor of a pathway to citizenship for them. To gun-shy Republicans like Senator Marco Rubio, who had spent 2012 opposing just such a proposal, Hannity was sending an unmistakable signal: they would now have some political cover on the network if they similarly  changed their public views, which Rubio quickly did. In a February article in The New Republic, Ailes, too, made a point of striking a more moderate tone toward Hispanics and said he dislikes the term "illegal immigrant," which the Fox News Latino network no longer uses. These changes of heart, it should be noted, involve only as much courage as it takes to agree with the owner of the company. One day after Obama's re-election and one day before Hannity's epiphany, Rupert Murdoch had tweeted: "Must have sweeping, generous immigration reform, make existing law-abiding Hispanics welcome."
Whether these recent, road-to-Damascus conversions are genuine or artificial may not matter much at this point, though. Hannity and many of his Fox News colleagues have invested so much time inciting animosity toward "illegals" and excoriating legislative attempts at "amnesty" that the network has acquired a reputation of harboring anti-Hispanic tendencies. In the aforementioned PPP poll on media trustworthiness, Hispanics ranked Fox News as their least credible news source, with a net four-point negative rating. (Broadcast news networks all enjoyed double-digit positive ratings.) Likewise, a National Hispanic Media Coalition survey from last fall found that Fox News hosts were more likely than those from any other network to negatively stereotype Latinos. It also noted that the network's audience had the highest percentage of viewers with negative feelings about Hispanics and undocumented immigrants.
Jim Gilmore, the former Republican governor of Virginia and current head of the Free Congress Foundation, a conservative think tank, warned against just this type of demographic alienation in a January interview with National Review. "Shrillness and extreme language are driving away the voters who could help us build a majority," Gilmore said. When contacted for this story, Gilmore made a point of saying that the network is "vital" to the conservative movement and added that his critique was not an  implicit indictment of Fox News: "All I can say is that if they are doing anything like that and polling is reflecting it, they ought to stop it, because that would reflect badly on the Republican Party."
That Gilmore's willingness to confront the party's mistakes hasn't yet caught up to understanding what's causing them is symbolic of the broad dilemma confronting the conservative movement right now. The unquestioning faith in Fox gives the network little incentive to undertake real change, since it allows Ailes to feel confident those prodigal conservative viewers will eventually return to the fold. While Fox still enjoys ratings victories, albeit narrower ones, conservatives have suffered significant losses at the ballot box in three of the past four national elections. And they face the prospect of even more defeats if they don't lead their movement out of the wilderness of serial misinformation and forgo the temptation of perpetual outrage.
Arresting this descent into grand conspiracy theories and self-destructive rancor won't be easy, though. "It makes it very difficult for guests who are being asked about Benghazi and Solyndra to talk about concrete policy issues," Cassino notes. Gilmore, at least, acknowledges as much. "It is our burden to go on Fox News and give the right message," he says. "If for some reasonbratings or whatever the reason isbthe commentators try to drag you to a place where you ought not to be, you have to resist going there."
John Stuart Mill, in his famous treatise On Liberty, understood that a "healthy state of political life" must necessarily include "a party of order or stability, and a party of progress or reform." So where exactly the conservative movement goes from here becomes a critical issue, since the Republican Party isn't about to spiral into electoral irrelevance anytime soon. Therefore, the degree to which it is grounded in reality and willing to collaborate reasonably in governance should matter a great deal to liberals, specifically, and to our democracy in general.
The devil's bargain that Ailes struck between his network and his politics seventeen years ago, however, looks unlikely to change within the foreseeable future. Fox News remains an all-too-comfortable gilded cage for Republicansbone that showcases the party but also shelters it from the slings and arrows of honest intellectual debate. One can rigidly confine an ideology for only so long, however, before its beliefs begin to ossify and its policies atrophy. It's an ironic twist: the more the network enables conservative ideas to stray from the mainstream, the less appealing the network's conservative coverage becomes. And after years of deeming their codependent relationship an unalloyed good, it's time Fox News and the Republican Party face cold reality. For both to enjoy long-term future success, each must recognize that the other isn't its salvation; instead, they're both part of the problem.
