In the wise words of William H. Geiger III:
I think the Nolan chart is flawed because the questions are all worded
in a leading manner, personally.
And Singapore survives quite well being a totalitarian capitalist
society. Sure, you can pick nits and claim that Singapore's not entirely
capitalist, but it's more capitalist than this country and certainly
less free, too.
The fact of the matter seems to me to be that most people are perfectly
satisfied to be passive consumers. While they like to be free, that
means free to make purchasing decisions. They also like to be safe, and
if they have to lose civil liberties to be safe, then they're all for
it. Just so long as they can buy what they want. That seems to me to
describe the essence of the Singapore problem, and I'd bet it holds true
for the U.S. (and many other places) as well.
And, regardless of whether the two are actually separate, the Nolan
chart is intended to measure peoples' _beliefs_ and _feelings_ about
economic and political freedom. And those, as this discussion proves,
are clearly separate.

@_subject: new PGP key 
Due to a hard drive crash near the beginning of last month and an inane
lack of backups, I lost my old PGP keys (2047/0xDED5B791 and
1024/0xEC001E4D). I've generated a new key, enclosed below. Key info is
as follows:
Type Bits KeyID      Created    Expires    Algorithm       Use
sec+ 2047 0x4CDD6451 1997-10-12 ---------- RSA             Sign & Encrypt f16    Fingerprint16 = D8 5A 85 06 93 6C 86 E8  79 3A 07 AA 15 6E 3A BD
I will personally verify this information at the physical DC Cypherpunk
meeting tomorrow (well, today, actually), as well as hand out copies of
the fingerprint. The key is also available at my web page, at either
 or
Yes, I keep backups now ;-)
