Yes, that seems to be an adoption barrier for darknets in general -
they're hard to try out on a casual basis.
I agree that replacing keys with short strings would be an
improvement, but I'm not sure it would require switching to Ed25519
(or elliptic curves generally). RetroShare has a DHT, so the key could
be referred to by its hash, which would be used to retrieve the full
key from the DHT.
(I believe you can join the DHT before adding any contacts - but I
could be wrong about that.)
If the P2P connections could be made to work seamlessly then I'd
agree. But my experience with (IPv4-based) P2P connections is that an
informed user can generally make them work better than an uninformed
user, by forwarding ports, setting up dynamic DNS, etc. So exposing
some of the networking details may be a reasonable pragmatic
compromise with the godawful state of the internet.
In general I'm quite pessimistic about the possibility of creating
IPv4-based darknets that work well for uninformed users.
Agreed! The abundance of (overlapping?) features is the thing I find
most off-putting about RetroShare.
By the way, I've just found out that the RetroShare team has a
fantastic development blog:
