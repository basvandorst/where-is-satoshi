Privacy abuse is first and foremost the failure
of a digital rights management system.  A broken
safe is not evidence that banks shouldn't use
safes.  It is only an argument that they shouldn't
use the safe than was broken.
I'm hard pressed to imagine what privacy without
DRM looks like.  Perhaps somebody can describe
a non-DRM privacy management system.  On the other
hand, I easily can imagine how I'd use DRM
technology to manage my privacy.
Yes, it would be nice if we didn't need safes but
until we don't, I'll use one.  You can choose not to
use DRM to manage your privacy but like stacking
your money on your front porch, you don't get to
grump if people take it.  It's called contributory
negligance, I believe.
Cheers, Scott

I don't believe that the choice is both privacy and TCPA, or neither.
Essentially all privacy violations are abuses of authorised access by
insiders. Your employer's medical insurance scheme insists on a
waiver allowing them access to your records, which they then use for
promotion decisions. The fizx is fundamentally legislative: that sort
of behaviour is generally illegal in Europe, but tolerated in the USA.
There may be symmetry when we consider the problem as theoretical
computer scientists might, as an issue for abstract machines. This
symmetry breaks rapidly when the applications are seen in context. As
well as the legal aspects, there are also the economic aspects: most
security systems promote the interests of the people who pay for them
(surprise, surprise).
So I do not agree with the argument that we must allow DRM in order to
get privacy. Following that line brings us to a world in which we have
DRM, but where the privacy abuses persist just as before. There is
simply no realistic prospect of American health insurers or HMOs settling for one-time read-only access to your medical records, no
matter how well that gets implemented in Palladium

Suppose.  Just suppose.  That you figured out a factoring
algorithm that was polynomial.  What would you do?  Would
you post it immediately to cypherpunks?    Well, OK, maybe
you would but not everyone would.  In fact some might
even imagine they could turn a sou or two.  And you can
bet the buyer wouldn't be doing any posting. With apologies
to Bon Ami, "Hasn't cracked yet" is not a compelling security Cheers, Scott

Hello, Rich ...
When I drill down on the many pontifications made by computer
security and cryptography experts all I find is given wisdom.  Maybe the reason that folks roll their own is because as far as they can see that's what everyone does.  Roll your own then whip out your dick and start swinging around just like the experts.
Perhaps I'm not looking in the right places. I wade through papers from the various academic cryptography groups, I hit the bibliographies regularly, I watch the newgroups, and I follow the patent literature.  After you blow the smoke away, there's always an "assume a can opener" assumption. The only thing that really differentiates the experts from the naifs is the amount of smoke.
Now I'm certainly not arguing that given wisdom and hard experience
have nothing to contribute but they aren't substitutes for either mathematical or even statistical certainty.  And I do note in passing that their history of delivering fundamental truth would counsel having a backup plan particularly
when it comes to the family jewels.
Cheers, Scott

 AT&T: EBay, PayPal Infringe on Patents E-mail orPrint this story
20 November 2003, 6:03pm ET
By RACHEL KONRAD AP Business Writer
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- AT&T Corp. reached out and smacked eBay Inc. with
a patent infringement lawsuit Thursday, claiming the online auction company
has been using a payment system that the telecommunications giant developed
more than a decade ago.
The case, filed in federal court in Delaware, comes on the heels of an
August verdict in which a Virginia judge ordered eBay to pay $29.5 million
to an inventor who accused the company of stealing his ideas for fixed
price sales formats.
AT&T's suit demands that eBay pay an undisclosed amount in licensing fees
because its lucrative PayPal division functions as a "trusted intermediary"
between buyers and sellers who may not know each other.
The system _ widely regarded as critical to eBay's gangbuster growth and a
boon to e-commerce in general _ lets buyers provide credit card or bank
account information to a reliable third party instead of individual sellers
around the world. Buyers merely have to trust PayPal, and they don't have
to worry about disreputable sellers using sensitive financial data for
fraudulent purposes.
AT&T says three senior engineers working for the phone company filed for a
patent in 1991 for exactly such a process, which they called "Mediation of
Transactions by a Communication System." The patent was granted in 1994,
AT&T said.
EBay spokesman Chris Donlay dismissed the lawsuit as "meritless," and he
said customers should count on continuing to use PayPal.
EBay acquired PayPal in October 2002, and the division immediately became
an engine of profits for San Jose-based eBay, one of the few Silicon Valley
companies to emerge unscathed from the dot-com collapse.
PayPal produced $106.4 million in revenue in the third quarter of 2003,
nearly twice what it generated in the same period last year. More than 11
million people used PayPal to conduct transactions from July to September,
according to eBay's most recent earnings statement.
Before PayPal, eBay relied on a similar system called Billpoint, which is
also named in the lawsuit.
9605.7913.63 (0.14%)
51.800.23 (0.44%)
19.630.53 (2.77%)
AT&T spokesman Gary Morgenstern said the lawsuit is the result of more than
a year of negotiations between the two companies. EBay refused to pay any
licensing fees, he said.
"AT&T invests hundreds of millions of dollars every year in our research
and development efforts, which have yielded a sizable portfolio of patents
_ that's what we're vigorously protecting here," Morgenstern said. "EBay
and PayPal have refused to compensate us for patented technology, and so
we're forced to take this to the courts."
Numerous inventors and small companies have sued or threatened to sue eBay,
and legal experts have been skeptical of many such claims. But some said
the newest plaintiff's heft gives the AT&T lawsuit the credibility that
cases brought by obscure inventors and operators of now-defunct dot-coms
"To be sure, AT&T's involvement makes this case different from others,"
said Neil A. Smith of the San Francisco-based law firm Howard, Rice,
Nemerovski, Canady, Falk & Rabkin. "AT&T's a well respected company that
doesn't just wave around patent lawsuits unless there's some merit."
Others, however, said that AT&T is unlikely to even force a settlement _
which is the way Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com resolved what might have
been the last such high-profile legal skirmish over Internet sales
strategies. That case, involving Amazon's "one-click" checkout method, was
filed in 1999 and settled last year. The companies have refused to disclose
the terms.
David Pressman, a San Francisco patent lawyer and author of "Patent It
Yourself," said at least half of all patent infringement lawsuits are won
by the defense or eventually dropped before reaching the courtroom.
And Greg Aharonian, San Francisco-based patent expert, said eBay could get
the case dismissed if it finds a company or institution that developed its
own "trusted intermediary" or similar electronic payment system even before
AT&T researchers filed for their patent.
"The question is, did anyone else have trusted third parties in the 1980s?
My gut reaction is that they existed," said Aharonian, publisher of the
daily Internet Patent News Service newsletter. "Some university professor
could have written an article on this, but no one paid attention and no
banks adopted it. Something like that could invalidate the lawsuit
