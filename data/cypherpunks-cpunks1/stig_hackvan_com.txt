I forwarded a cypherpunks message to technomads, where it got a killer
response, so I'll bounce it back to Cypherpunks...

@_subject: The Rise of "Worse is Better"... 
A while ago, I mentioned appendix C to the _Unix-Haters Handbook_ and someone
(Jason?) was interested in it.  I couldn't come up with the text of the
chapter until now because I didn't have it until now.
Look through the Lisp-specific jargon to see what RPG (the author) has to
say about the differrent priorities in getting a job done...  One school of
engineering follows "The Right Thing" approach, while the other uses the
"Worse is Better" (quick-and-dirty) approach.

No crypto/privacy relevance.  Software methodology relevance.  It makes
points about why it's better to get 50% out the door immediately than to be
overly stuck on doing everything "The Right Way"...
That the "Worse is Better" approach has better survival characteristics than
"The Right Way" approach is applicable to the mission(s) of the cypherpunks
is it not?  Of course, in the case of the cypherpunks, it may be preaching
to the converted and if that is the case, then I apologize...
I only subscribe to cp-lite, so I don't have to read all the rehashed
flames.  I suppose that I should be glad that I missed it...

I'll second Eric on the utility of this practice.  I should've done this...
I lost a new pgp key when my hard disk hit the fan last month.  I can't even
revoke it...      Stig
FYI:  The key to ignore is 0x31F61BA9.  The new key is on a server near you.

@_subject: DES & IDEA built right into the Linux kernel... 
Nicholas Leon  has created tools that allow DES and
IDEA encryption at the device level for the Linux kernel.  Some of the
patches are in the 2.0.4 kernel, and the rest can be found at

@_subject: #E-CASH: PRODUCT OR SERVICE? 
Perhaps this has already been voiced on the main list (I get a filtered
helping or two of cypherpunks), but *I'm* surprised that such a generic name
as 'Ecash' was granted trademark status anywhere.
It's like giving Microsoft a trademark on the term 'Email'...  It's nuts!
Was the term ecash not in use before DigiCash showed up on the scene?     Stig
