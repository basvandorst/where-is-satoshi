@_subject: biological systems and cryptography 
People do break cyphers, by finding weaknesses in them. Are you saying
that you think that current cyphers are unbreakable?
Also, what about using biological systems to create strong cyphers,
not to break them?
It seems that all of these analyses assume that an instruction is a
single mathematical operation in a turing machine. What if each
operation was something else? I refuse to believe that the human mind
is just a turing machine.

@_subject: the news from bush's speech 
How about this news?
Last night in the State of the Union address, Bush repeated the lie
that Iraq is creating nuclear weapons, stating the evidence of the
aluminum tubes purchased, which he claimed were used to enrich
These remarks were made despite the fact, discussed here:
that the International Atomic Energy Agency's report on Monday stated
clearly that the tubes "cannot be used directly for [uranium]
So, Bush is either illiterate or just flat out lying, once again.

@_subject: Life Sentence for Medical Marijuana? 
I think this is what you call "taxation without representation"
Note also, that the judge in the case was the brother of the supreme
court judge who bush appointed who's totally opposed to these sates
right cases. Great how bush's daughter, the cocaine addict, isn't in jail, but this
man, who was deputized by the city of oakland to grow this marijuana,
is going to be in jail for 20 years. Bush himself was arrested for
DUI, I wish he was rotting in jail instead of ed. disgusting.
