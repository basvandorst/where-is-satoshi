No law says the attack has to be brute force.  What about the birthday attack, differential cryptanalysis, etc?  True, I believe neither of those examples are applicable to RSA, but factoring is, and it's _much_ more efficient than brute force searches.  There might be other algorithems out there (or as yet undiscovered) that are more efficient than current factoring algorithms are (or ever hope to be).  If your attacker has an algorithm whereby he has to search less than the full keyspace, he has effectively reduced the size of your key.  Essentially, his attack is the same order of magnitude as a brute force search of this new reduced keyspace (call it "effective" keyspace for convenience).  The greater difference between the effective keyspace and the real keyspace (determined by his cracking algorithm), the larger I need to make my real key to compensate.  If his algorithm effectively cuts my keyspace in half, I need to make it twice as large as I would need if my attacker's best algorithm were brute be infeasible
Hmmm... Well, the 384-bit Blacknet PGP key was cracked in just a few months.  How?  Certainly parallelism helped, but the main reason is that they were factoring keys rather than searching the full keyspace by brute force.  I don't know about you, but I'm certainly not going to stop increasing the size of my key simply because it can't be cracked by brute force.

You are correct.  I'm afraid I was thinking one thing and typing another.
What I meant to say is that the attacker has an algorithm that effectively cuts my keySIZE (instead of keyspace) in half,  i.e. his algorithm requires him to try on average only 2^1023 keys (instead of 2^2047 for a brute force attack) to crack my key of 2048 bits.
Thanks for pointing this out.

 Apparently,
Chalk one up for the good guys.  Thanks for hanging in there Phil.
