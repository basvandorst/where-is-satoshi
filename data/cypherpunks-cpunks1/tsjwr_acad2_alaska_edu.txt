@_subject: Cypherpunks Cause 
You bet there is a cypherpunks cause, and if there isn't there should be.
The cypherpunks cause: to promote encryption and other privacy software
usage on the Internet until it is beyond the control of totalitarian
governments.  In other words, to protect the privacy rights of all by making privacy universal.
Any questions?

@_subject: Atari and VAX 
If I owned a PC clone or a Mac, I'd be sitting pretty.  If my host machine
was Unix, I'd be fine.  But I'm using an Atari emulating vt100 off a VAX 6510.  Is there any help for me?  How can I be a cypherpunk?
I want to be using PGP, but I haven't found it for either machine I'm on.
Any suggestions?

To those obnoxious codeheads who flipped me off with a suggestion that I
do my own port of PGP to the Atari and/or VAX:
Kiss my elbow!
Anyone ignorant enough to write code before doing a search to see if the code is already available deserves to take your brain dead advice.  Foolishly
thinking that the cypherpunks were interested in spreading encryption
technology on the Internet, I logically assumed an inquiry on this list
would be part of such a search.
Maybe the cypherpunks are a government front organization set up for _preventing_ the spread of encryption technology on the Internet.
Stranger things have happened.
