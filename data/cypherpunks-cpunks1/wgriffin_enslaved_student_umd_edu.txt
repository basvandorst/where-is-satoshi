This statement is seriously confusing Key Recovery and Key Escrow.  They are NOT the same thing.  Everybody knows what Key *Escrow* is and that it sucks.  Key Recovery is *very* different in that are no databases kept of private keys.
The website you mentioned ( contains some very good info on how Key Recovery works.  I would like to see the source of Schneier's quote also, because I can't believe he could get the two confused.
