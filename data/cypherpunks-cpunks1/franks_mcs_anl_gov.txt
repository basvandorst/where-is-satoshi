Can anyone explain how sophisticated those fingerprint readers are?
Are there readers out there that by themselves are secure devices and essentially are able to talk with their servers thru the PCs/workstations over a protocol such that any man-in-the-middle, like a driver, can not learn anything from the traffic?
(...and all that for less than $40, of course...)
If not, would a trojan then be able to capture your fingerprint's digital-fingerprint, and impersonate you from any other node on the network?
