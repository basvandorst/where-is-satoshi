DCE is exported today, although without the ability to encrypt application
traffic.  Authentication and message integrity are in the export version.
    They are attacks against Diffie-Hellman. I don't know if DCE uses D-H
    in a similar manner. The main problem was too small a (fixed) modulus.
DCE RPC uses Kerberos V5 to establish DES session keys.

Another "RPC" comes from the Open Software Foundation, who
    unfortunately chose the same acronym for the remote procedure calling
    mechanism in their Distributed Computing Environment (DCE).  This DCE
    is a part of the OSF/1 operating system, but implementations are
    available for many versions of UNIX, often as a separate product or
    option.
This is a semi-common misconception, there is no relationship between DCE
and OSF/1.  OSF/1 was one of the reference platforms during the original
DCE development, but so was SVR4, AIX and HP/UX.
Except for parts of DFS (the distributed file system), all of DCE is
user-mode code and ports easily between un*x platforms.
