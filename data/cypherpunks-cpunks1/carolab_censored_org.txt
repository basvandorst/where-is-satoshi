@_subject: Sizzling!!! Was: Crypto = Co 
Dear Mr. Bank President,
Seems? All of the Net' stocks are far outpacing my Coca-Cola shares
right now. And, my Coke stock is at all time highs. My Coke stock is
up 1150% in 10 years. Sizzling appears to be a better word for it.
Good Coke traders everywhere ARE trying to cash in on this very
fab trading pattern. It looks to me that Viacrypt would do really
well when PGP 3.0 comes out, particularly if it has a GUI interface.
And if TCMAY ever became a "pink sheet" stock, I'd stop everything
and buy some shares in it. Love Always,
Carol Anne

Perry works too hard sometimes.
Tim writes kewl articles.
Mr. Young keeps us up tp date on the Times.
Wei Dei has RSA on his case, in unwarranted fashion.
Alex gets it all across the water.
Brad is hung up on Vince Foster.
Lucky Green needs his antique tin.
Futplex has a cool name, and hot pointers.
Joel lives in his own 'Private Idaho'.
Robert now "Pinesigns" everything.
And today My web counter showed that over 1,000 folks had now used
my web page to get PGP. This includes over 300 shipped 'across the
dreaded water zones'. (sound of 1 hand clapping!)
I write code....html, that is......
I do attempt to use it judiciously.
censored.org censors no one. Just quietly enters
things to the unread mail stack (now 11.3 megs)
for a rainy day.
Have a fun summer...fall is coming soon, and light
a candle for Jerry Garica today.

I'm kind of a nobody.....
I can't write elaborate code.
I can't even crack keys, unless it's plug & play cracking.
But I do know SOMETHING important was done here.
And once it's been done, it only gets easier each time.
Congratulations to all of you!

    Warning: it may be illegal to use one of these as a sig file in the US
   Don't feel obliged to use this chunk just because you have requested
   it. It hardly matters if some parts aren't posted as there are easier
   ways to get PGP, like open ftp sites, from which it is 100% legal for
   both US and non-US people to ftp from. It is merely a political
   statement about the ridiculous nature of ITAR regulations

its because it will spell the death of Ticketmaster.
We can show you where your seat is in the stadia or arena.
We can then sell you the ticket on a secure socket.
And then let you print the ticket on your own printer.
The economics of this are fantastic.

I don't see why you call it what it really is.
It is stealing.
For if you reversed the process on Microsoft,
as you had any contact with them,
I'm sure that's what they'd call it.
It no different that being seductive
while you remove their wallet.
Stealing yes, privacy no.

@_subject: You have cashed my check.... 
Dear First Virtual,
You now present puzzling information.
You have cashed my check.
So why are you telling me that you have no bank information.
You stated that the check itself provided the bank information.
If this situation persists,
I will forward said materials and
correspondence to the State of Minnesota Attorney General's Office,
and the U.S. District Attorney's Office for prosecution.
For what you have connumicated so far surely appears fraudulent.
I don't have much money as it is. But then maybe (considering all of
the lag time) this is your scam. Maybe this is entirely legitimate,
and just an honest mistake.
I have added below your opening correspodence of July 18th, the day before the check cashed.
Awaitng your response,
Carol Anne Braddock

@_subject: Transgenders begin lobbying against ITAR 
Transgender Lobby Days has come and gone.
I taught transgender persons about PGP and ITAR.
It got a good reception, and they are beginning to use it.
We went to all 535 congressional offices in two days,
and began to get the "transgender lobby block" noticed.
We did get all of the legislative staffers email addresses,
and will spill the results of this soon, so you can mount
an anti-ITAR campaign of you own.
I concentrated on the media galleries, and began to get the
transgender positions related to the media. We did get lots of
press, and a 20-20 piece coming soon.
They were all virtually uninformed about ITAR or the
Netscape situation. I did my best on ITAR while I was there.
This report is being filed at alt.coffee, a cybercoffeehouse
on Avenue A and 10th Street, in New York City. Gotta go this is costing 16.00 an hour to file.
