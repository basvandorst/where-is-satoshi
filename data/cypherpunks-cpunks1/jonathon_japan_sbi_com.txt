@_subject: Nortel "Entrust" 
Can anyone tell me anything about a product called "Entrust", by Nortel
(Northern Telecom). The notes talk about the software using DES ("which
employs a 56-bit key") so I guess it's single DES, not triple DES. It also
mentions a proprietary algorithm called CAST.   Is this worthy of further investigation, or is it suspect ? What is CAST, and would it be classed as snake oil ?
  Please cc to me in mail - I have a little trouble dealing with the volume here.
