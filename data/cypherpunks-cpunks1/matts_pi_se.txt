Nope. The VB program should give a popup window where you can enter your
passphrase to sign/decrypt the message. Such a popup can have a  button
if you don't want it to do its thing.
But how often do you receive an encrypted letter for which you have the
secret key, and don't want the letter decrypted?
Actually, I was already working on such a program when these posts came by,
so any suggestions to functionality are welcome!

Sure, what did you expect? A program that obtains your pass phrase without a
user interface?!? That would be a neat hack if you could pull it off. Should
it do mind reading, or just crack the pass phrase by brute force?
Seriously, the idea here is that the pgp front end shouldn't deal with the
user interface in your present mail program. Nobody (before you) have
considered doing it completely without a user interface.

Ok, we'll skip the list. They probably don't care about this nit picking.
I did read it the first time around. Very carefully, since I was already
debugging the program he was talking about. He wrote " the VB program
decrypts any PGP mail it sees," and I believe that decryption requires a
user interface for the pass phrase.
But I think that Mike can speak for himself on the list. Let's end this
discussion about what he meant.  We obviously interpreted his idea differently.

You don't have to. PGP already exists in an international version as well as
a US version. Just make your software call PGP to do all encryption and ask
the user to download PGP from his favorite web site (on his side of the US

@_subject: Looking for code to run an encrypted mailing list 
You could avoid alot of encryption by setting up a key for the list and
giving both keys (secret and public) to all the list members. To write to
the list, you encrypt with the lists public key. Everybody reading the list
can decrypt with the secret key.
Pros: No hacking of majordomo. You can use any mailing list software. The
key and clear text message is never available to a robot, making it harder
to compromise security.
Cons: When somebody is removed from the list you have to change the key,
encrypt the new secret key with everybodys public keys and distribute it.
For a big dynamic list where people unsubscribe daily this could be a major
headache. But for small or static lists it shouldn't be much of a problem.

They probably will once the Post Bank gets going with ecash. Until then
there are legal difficulties. Swedish online merchants can't even accept
credit cards. They need an order in hand writing or voice before they
can charge the card.
My offer was to open an account with any ISP, whether they accept ecash
or not. I think that improves the anonymity of the account.

It's not just marketing, it's a fact of life. 16 bit operating systems are not
supported any more. Just as 8 bit OSes haven't been supported for quite
a while either. There will come a day when 64 bits are considered the
minimum for useful software (large database systems are already there).
You just can't stick with 16 bits forever, MS-free or not. Face it.

@_subject: A cryptographic alternative to escrow agents (Matts' half coin) 
Black Unicorn wrote (was: Why does the state still stand)
It should be possible to avoid that trusted escrow agent using blinded
ecash and Matts' half coin algorithm.
Bob wants to buy a $100 service from Alice. Alice wants to get paid if she
performs the service.
Bob and Alice each create half of a $300 ecash coin. They send their half
coins to the ecash mint for signing, with instructions to withdraw $200
from Bob's account and $100 from Alice's account for the signing of a
$300 coin.
When the mint has received both half coins, it signs the complete coin,
withdraws the money and returns the signature to both Alice and Bob.
Nobody can now use the coin alone because they don't know the other half
of the random coin number.
Next, Alice delivers the service to Bob.
If Bob is satisfied with the service, he and Alice write a message to the
mint requesting that the complete coin be credited with $100 to Bob's
account and $200 to Alice'. Alice has now been paid.
If Bob refuses to pay, Alice will never give him her half coin and he loses
$200, but he got a $100 service, resulting in a net loss of $100.
If Alice refuses to deliver the service, Bob keeps his half coin and she
loses $100.
Both participants lose $100 each if they don't complete the deal. That
way they have the same incentive to come to an agreement.
To simplify the messages to the mint you could use two coins. One for
$100 and one for $200. That way there would be a one-to-one relation
between deposits, withdrawals and coins.
The algorithm described above (Matts' half coin) is copyrighted by
yours truly Matts Kallioniemi. Patents pending.

If he was indeed subscribed to 2200 mailing lists, you can assume that
he didn't read all the "welcome messages." For people who are stuck with
old fashioned mail systems (no filters, no macro language) this is a serious
problem. It would be rude to call the victims clueless and subscribe them to
even more "clueless mailing lists."

@_subject: SEVERE undercapacity, we need more remailer servers FAST 
IP spoofing would do this nicely.Since SMTP doesn't require any
significant responses, you can send blind and fake your IP address.
To do that you need root access on your mailer machine and an
ISP that doesn't sniff and filter its network for spoofing attacks.
See ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-95:01.IP.spoofing for
a good description of spoofing attacks and defenses.
If you're not up to writing spoofing code into your (re-)mailer, then
an easier solution is to send everything through anon.lcs.mit.edu after
you have removed all headers that point at you.

How do you create such tiny payments? When I try (2.1.5a MT)
to pay $.001 I receive the warning "Too many digits after '.'!" and
even though it's just a warning I can't do the payment.
Assuming that you had a client that allows tiny amounts, how would
you represent a tenth of a cent in binary? To to it exactly would
require an infinite number of coins...

Now we're back to pennies again. I was more interested in your
earlier claim of tiny payments, on the order of $2^-32.
Will the api make it possible to create coins of arbitrary value? Is
the mint software (and the bank accountants) capable of doing
floating point arithmetic?

Yes I do. Several major currency traders in Sweden keep all
their money in 64 bit floating point storage. I think that DigiCash
will go floating point (get real?) when you start doing currency.
If you sell 1 DEM, you don't want to get paid in cents, you want
to get paid in 10-15 decimal places. That's where the currency
action is right now, and before Ecash(tm) is fully deployed we'll
probably see traders going for 15-20 decimal places. Floating
point is the way to do it, but are your accountants ready for it?
Sorry, I thought that the client created the coins and the mint
just signed them. I guess I should go back to RTFAPI.

As I said yesterday, there are in fact people dealing with billions
in all major currencies that keep their money in 64 bit floats. The
precision is far better than anything you can do in 32 bit integers.
Trust me, this is a fact and can easily be proven.
The "get real" was a pun on floats. Many languages, such as Pascal,
calls them real numbers. Sorry I forgot the smiley.
In my client (2.1.5a MT) there is no way to do currency conversion.
If I go to a FIM or DEM merchant I can't buy anything in the store.
This will probably change in the near future when a new client is
released, and then we'll have the question of how to represent these
currencies in one wallet.
What do you think will happen if you have a one italian lira coin and
you try to deposit it with Mark Twain's USD account? With integer
math it won't be pretty.
Maybe you should start looking for it. You'll need it when the lira

Sure, but we were really discussing Ecash(tm), not accounting. To quote
from the FAPI:

Come on, we're not talking cents here. Question is, how do you represent
a one ITL coin in Ecash(tm) with a USD mint? We are way below the cent
level, where no accountant has ever gone before...

Why would anyone set up a remailer at Lance's (or Sameer's) machine?
They have remailers running already. If the thugs break root and obtain
one remailer key from a machine, they probably get all the keys on that
machine, compromising all the remailers in one single attack. Or am I
missing something? Is there any benefit of multiple remailers on a machine
where root is running his own remailer?

One benefit of non root / anonymous remailers is deniability. When the
police come knocking on root's door, root can say that he didn't know about
the kiddie porn remailer and he will shut it down asap. It will be hard to
prove that he had intent to run a remailer (assuming that remailers are
outlawed, like they are in France?).
A remailer that logs traffic is still useful because it will take the enemy
some time and money to get the log. With plenty of remailers in your chain,
that's plenty of time and money, and hopefully at least one remailer isn't
keeping logs.
