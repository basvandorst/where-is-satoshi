The publication has been supported by EU COST b European Cooperation in  Science and Technology and the EU COST Action IS0807 bLiving in  Surveillance Societiesb.
This book is the first ever published volume that is dedicated to Internet surveillance in the age of what has come to be termed bsocial mediab or bweb 2.0b3 (blogs, wikis, file sharing, social networking sites, microblogs, user-generated content sites, etc). The Internet has been transformed in the past years from a system primarily oriented on information provision into a medium for communication and community-building. The notion of bWeb 2.0b, social software, and social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and MySpace have emerged in this context. With such platforms comes the massive provision and storage of personal data that are systematically evaluated, marketed, and used for targeting users with advertising. In a world of global economic competition, economic crisis, and fear of terrorism after 9/11, both corporations and state institutions have a growing interest in accessing this personal data. Here, contributors explore this changing landscape by addressing topics such as commercial data collection by advertising, consumer sites and interactive media; self-disclosure in the social web; surveillance of file-sharers; privacy in the age of the internet; civil watch-surveillance on social networking sites; and networked interactive surveillance in transnational space. This book is a result of a research action launched by the intergovernmental network COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology).

@_subject: [liberationtech] /. ITU Approves Deep Packet Inspection 
If this approval by the ITU is true - then it is no surprise at all, but  what one would expect. What else has the ITU in the past ever been than an instrument that supports capitalist interests and commodification of the ICT and telecommunications industries?
DPI can advance large-scale monitoring of citizens by the state-capital  complex that is connected by a right-wing state ideology of fighting crime and terror by massive use of surveillance technologies and a neoliberal ideology of capitalist organisations that want to make a profit out of surveillance and want to hinder the undermining of intellectual property See this:

Fuchs, Christian. 2012. Implications of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)  Internet Surveillance for Society. The Privacy & Security-Research Paper  Series, edited by Emilio Mordini and Christian Fuchs. ISSN 2270-7467.  Research Paper Number 1. EU FP7 project bPACT b Public Perception of  Security and Privacy: Assessing Knowledge, Collecting Evidence,  Translating Research into Actionb. 125 pages.
Internet surveillance technologies have recently received attention when  it became public that Western security companies exported such equipment  to countries like Syria, Libya, Iran, Egypt or Bahrain, where they seem to have been used for repression agaisnt political activists. This research report focuses on the analysis of the political economy of one such communications surveillance technology - Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). It analyses societal implications of DPI Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) surveillance technologies are communications surveillance tools that are able to monitor the traffic of network data that is sent over the Internet at all seven layers of the OSI Reference Model of Internet communication, which includes the surveillance of content data.
The analysis presented in this paper is based on product sheets,  self-descriptions, and product presentations by 20 European security  technology companies that produce and sell DPI technologies. For each
company, we have conducted a document analysis of the available files. It focused on the four following aspects:
1) Description and use of the Internet surveillance technologies that are produced and sold.
2) The self-description of the company.
3) The explanation of the relevance of Internet surveillance, i.e. why the company thinks it is important that it produces and sells such  4) A documentation of what the company says about opportunities and  problems that can arise in the context of Internet surveillance.
The assessment of societal implications of DPI is based on opinions of  security industry representatives, scholars, and privacy advocates that  were voiced in white papers, tech reports, research reports, on websites, in press releases, and in news media.
The results can be summarized in the form of several impact dimensions:
1. Potential advantages of DPI
2. Net neutrality
3. The power of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for undermining usersb  4. Potential function creep of DPI surveillance
5. Targeted advertising
6. The surveillance of file sharers
7. Political repression and social discrimination
The conducted analysis of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technologies shows that there is a variety of potential impacts of this technology on  society. A general conclusion is that for understanding new surveillance  technologies, we do not only need privacy and data protection assessments, but broader societal and ethical impact assessments that take into account the political economy of the security-industrial complex.
