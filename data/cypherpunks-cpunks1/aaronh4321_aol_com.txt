@_subject: Van Eck articles, reply.. 
I went to the library and found an article on Van Eck. I posted it at my
site. It was a little long to e-mail. Check it out at:
  If anyone has more current information please e-mail me.

@_subject: Why are 1024 bit keys the limit right now? 
I am just starting at this. I know that part of RSA/PGP's strength comes from
the size key you choose. What prevents someone from writting a 2048 bit key?
Is it because computers can't handle it? Is 1024 top of  the prime number
size right now? Am I way off track?

@_subject: PGP 2.6.3i 
Thanks, I have been meaning to ask someone about that. It is billed as the
International Version. I see it all over the place, except MIT. Is there
anyway this could be a weakened version? How can this be checked? And if it
isn't released by Phil or MIT how can it be called PGP?

@_subject: Diehard can be found at. 
I found this address for it after a couple of tries getting to the
"Diehard.html" site. I couldn't connect to that. This FTP site works though.
I found it at To qoute, "An excellent test of random sequences is DIEHARD, maintained by
George Marsaglia. You get it by ftp from stat.fsu.edu, login anonymous, cd
pub, cd diehard, then get what you want. NOTE: George needs you to send him
mail at geo at stat.fsu.edu when you download it so he can keep getting grants
to support his excellent work."

@_subject: One time pads and randomness? 
I want to use a one time pad pased crypto system. I understand that the
randomness of the pad genorator is key to security(other than lossing the
keys). What I want to know is if I use a psuedo-RNG that maybe repeats its
self every 1000 characters and use it to only encrypt messagase that are
100's of charaters long, will this be a major security risk? Next question:
Say I create a 1 million character one time pad that passes all of the
randomness tests. It is "truely random". I place it on two computers. Now
when these two computers want to send email computer "A" grabs a chunk of the
one time pad  starting at a random point and encrypts it. It labels the email
with the random starting point and sends it to "B". There "B" moves to the
random point and begins decryption. During to process both computers mark
that section of the OTP used so that they don't retransmit with it. I realize
this has a limited amount of messages before it is used up. But would this be
secure? Any suggestions, complaints, big gapping holes I missed?

@_subject: One time pads, Next question? 
Okay, with the intel I have gotten from the responses let me modify and
clarify. So, I now know that you can't use a PRNG to create a OTP. If I did have a RNG
that could create a "cryptographically" random, million character OTP and I
physically loaded the data onto each computer I wanted to communicate
with(e.i. group of laptops all loaded at the same location, same time), how
cryptographically secure would the data be. I know that physical security
would be a nessescary to the system. If I add some type of error checking to make sure someone that knows the
plaintext doesn't modify specific characters, an attacker knows what the
message is (e.g. "Send $10 to Bob") the message can be altered (to "Send $99
to Bob") even though it is encrypted. So, lets recap. If the keyig material is kept secure, and if the OTP is
cryptographically random, and if error checking is implemented then would
this be considered a secure(however encumbering it may be) system.
