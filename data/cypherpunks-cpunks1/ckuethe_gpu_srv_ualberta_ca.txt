@_subject: Laptops and TEMPEST 
[snip]
Here's some more about that.  I use both the Texas Instruments ti85 and
Hewlett Packard HP48 graphics calculators.  I was playing tetris on my ti85
one day and had the radio on.  every now and then this funny noise would
come out of my radio.  After a while I noticed it was sync'ed with a
keypress on my calc.  So I tried some experiments, and I found that doing just about anything would emit a detectable signal.  Keep in mind that I was
using a cheap radio, tuned to a 100kW radio stn and still could tune in a
calc.  I tried indiviual keystrokes.........yup
individual pixel changes.....yup
printing to screen...........yup
"For" loop...................yup
and they all sound different.  My favorite was the for loop.... sounds like
a diesel engine.  Maybe that's why my calc is running so slow.  it's only
going at 1500 RPM (revolutions per minute) The hamster inside must be
getting tired. I guess that's why there's that crap like this that's printed in the manual
of everything electronic...
I think it was "Lucky Green" whose friend saw the little TEMPEST demo.
Perhaps this friend might care to elaborate on this issue.  I almost wonder
if there is some kind of order from on high (NSA, [A-Za-z0-0]1,5) <--regexp
to include other agencies like CSIS, MI5, Mafia, etc... -- to make "leaky"
computers. So now we have to have thermite wired onto our HD's and Noise
generators on the board. :) ICK.

Where would we be if he hadn't tried?  I tend to agree with Sandy on this
one.  BTW, I am humor-impaired, so this might be a response taking your
attempt at humor too seriously.
In fact where would we be if a lot of other things hadn't been tried.
George Boole, Charles Babbage, Allan Turing.  They were laughed at/
scorned for trying.  Aren't we all Guy Fawkes in a way?  Cypherpunks I
mean.  I still have faith in us.  I quote the cypherpunks manifesto:
     We don't care much if you don't approve of the software      we write.  We know that software can't be destroyed and
     ...shut down.
Idealism and stretching things a bit, maybe, but there is a parallel to be
drawn.  How many of us use crypto illegally and don't care? How many of us
care that it's illegal to use crypto and thats why we do it.  How often
have we seen this propelled overseas in the signatures of cypherpunks:

           -sp0777i.  We must show BB
that we do not condone it.
Violence won't work.  Yeah...next C'Punks meeting outside NSA HQ.
Everybody bring your own bombs and guns. That would go over *really* well.
But at least all the papers would write about us.  So we're forced into
something like this.  Export a munition three times daily.  Geez...BB
could really get you hardcore.  And what's even funnier: the
whitehouse.gov autoresponder.  Dear King Billy: I just exported a munition
illegally.  Have a nice day.  And they don't care. Whitehouse just replies
"Thanks. nice letter"  So we, the peons are getting ignored again.  We
should do something to get noticed.
I cried the day I got my drivers licence and social insurance number. THe
gov't now knows who I am... for so many years I was a non-taxable
non-entity who showed up occasionally as someone's dependant at tax time.
Then, suddenly i was a swiftly accessible statistic. EVIL EVIL EVIL.
So saying we salute those who tried makes us terrorists... no.  Guy is
much maligned... and it's a much more efecive way of changing the gov't
than is on lowly ballot.  :)  Statistically that is.  Gee this was almost
on topic.... but really.  Let's try... instead of complain.  And those who
have tried: I salute you.

Ok... I want everybody to go buy a box of diskettes, and put copies of PGP
on them.  Then we'll save our boxes of PGP for when everything but GAK is
illegal, and the thought police are stealing hard drives.  BTW, I really
like that thermite on the HD thing. A possibly better idea could be
something that eats the platters.... little container of nitric acid.
Anyway.. that's off topic. If I'm understanding correctly, In the year 2000 (whatever) when we use
crypt(3) it's just a call to the NSAcryptoGAK chip on the board. and
that's supposed to be good enough for everyone.  What's next? A processor
that detects an unGAK'd software crypto program running and phones the NSA
or whoever?
One more thing... what's this about MD5 being broken... references,
webpages, whatever would be nice.

@_subject: [CRYPTO] Bank Cards, Interac, Bank Machines, etc 
I'd like to hear what everyone knows about security holes in bank
machines.  I don't believe in that little bank machine cracker they used
in Terminator 2, but I'm interested in the algorithms and protocols the
ABM uses to communicate w/ the home bank.  My bank says they have some
special chip inside the ABM to secure the transfer, and that's all they
told me.  I also heard that the magnetic stripe on the back contains your card
number (the shiny metallized numbers on the front) encrypted using DES
using your PIN as the key.  Way out to lunch?  Too close for comfort?  Any
knowledge...heck, even rumors.... would be appreciated.  That way we can
see what kind of FUD is out there.  My bet is that the magstrip with DES'd
card number on it theory is FUD.  But my bank did say that there were some
fraudulent transfers (read successful hits) in Europe.  I bank with Alberta
Treasury Branches, and they said their hardware is immune to the attack
that was performed in Europe.... I will have to dig a bit on that one.
Anyway, I hope I hear something from all of you soon...

Why does it not surprise me that TIS gets permission to export 56-bit (DES?) ?
They do key recovery (is it GAK?) They brag about government consulting. The
clients they will admit to having are listed on:
and, purely unsubstantiated rumors here, but I've heard (seen) TIS, NSA, FBI and other  "friends" of ours all together in the same paragraph. Conspiracy?
Maybe... This is both good and bad.... yes, longer codes are now exportable,
but only to / by certain people?
I notice that the new cipher length is 56 bit...same size as DES? hopefully
that's just a coincidence (yeah, right) or maybe somebody's starting to see
the real world where people download pirate cryptosystems and says "so let's
export bigger ones and make a buck off it, too..." (yeah, right)

@_subject: Airport security [no such thing] 
Ummmm... a few comments.  I flew from McCarran Int'l (las Vegas) to Durango,
CO via Denver over new years.  Due to my transportation arrangements I was
forced to "camp out" in the airport overnight.  That was OK, because I'd just
come off a camping trip anyway.  No security people came and asked me what I
was doing hovering so close to the security doors at 2am.  I would have checked my luggage as soon as I got there, but United Airlines
only lets you check in 4 hours before departure..  And checkin opens at 5 and
I had a flight shortly thereafter.  No biggie.  As I checked my stuff (1 bag
and skis) I mumbled like I didn't care: "Yes I packed this myself, yes it's
been in my posession continuously since I packed it, no I haven't been asked
to transport anything by persons unknown to me." I got an eyebrow but that's
it.  Apparently they don't have to *ask* they just need the answers.
Going thru security, I told them the were not going to fry my HP (hp48gx
calculator - I had homework) they could hand check... they did.  OK fine.
There's 2 card slots for memcards they  didn't check. approximately
2"x3.5"x.6"  how much "stuff" could you put in there?  And it has a timer
built in.  It wouldn't be too hard to "forget" it on a plane...  THen the
metal detectors.  *PingPingPing* (the ping of death) "Step this way sir."
through the other gate. *PingPingPing*   I hate it when this happens.  It was
my hiking boots.  HiTec Sierra Lite II.  Steel shank... or steel stilletto
or... or... or...  you get the drift.  interesting things could be put inside
the sole of the boot.
At the gate... this is the cool part.  Everybody remember the thread about ID
and airlines?  Well I got an E-Ticket, purchased in my name, by someone I'd
never met. I needed ID to check in, but at the gate? Nope... the ETKT is a 1
piece card and you just show that to the flight attendant and your on... no
boarding pass.  So Chris Kuethe (Me) could have picked up his ETKT and given
it to Mr. Clark (Tom Clancy superassassin/SEAL) and that's it.  Or Mr. Clark
could have faked it.... you can access UAL reservations on the WWW. So it
looks like ETKT's are the weak link. There was no hard doc of me getting on
the plane.  And some weak spot in security.  *sigh* Rent-a-Cops!
Durango was interesting.  I got there to go home after skiing CO (Wolf Creek)
I get to the Check in counter.  "Yes sir No sir three bags full sir"  same
crap about my luggage contents.  Flight leaves from gate 1.  There's 2 ways to
gate 1: go straight down the hall, or go left, thru security, go right, into
the insecure waiting room.  I did number 1. I get on the plane.  No id req'd.
It was a DHC-8 (Dash 8).  So I walked across the tarmac, and boarded. Fine.
Flew for an hour, and landed in denver, where I had to switch flights. So here
I am... unsearched passenger in a secure area! This is about to change. I
arrived at gate 59e. Walk in. There, between me and the doors to the rest of
the terminal is a real checkpoint. Same drill.  Not nuking my calc. See it
works... plays tetris, too.  Hiking boots again. they really ought to xray
boots that beep. but anyway, they didn't ask for ID there either. They new I
was coming from an insecure airport (Durango) and security was waiting.
Funny, I left through that gate, too, and there was no security then. "Special
Events Only" I guess... I mean this make me feel like james bond and all, but
it's also creepy.  And they say they've increased security... :(
Another bad one last time I was there was Campbell River, BC, Canada. To help
"suspicious items" pass security, put computer stickers on it. I went through
Edmonton Intl with a laser, with all the warning stickers on it... I even had
the batteries handy and my swiss army knife to open it up... I had 6 security
officers come over and check it out, and then they saw the "Apple Computer"
sticker on there (decoration only) and left me alone. So, to wrap up... Fly on United Airlines. Check   -- reservation/
check-in computer.  Get an E-Ticket. Durango, Colorado: BAD / NO SECURITY!
Durango's airport code is DRO... not to be confused with Durango, New Mex...
Yeah... took the words outta my mouth.  Let's all write to the FAA, DOT, etc.
and tell them what morons they are...  sorry tell them that they need work. No
more Lockerbies, TWA800's and other such tragedies.
