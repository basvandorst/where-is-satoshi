I would be extremely wary of this as accepting code written by someone else to
automatically run on your machine is bad. I realise the non unix people are
forced to use binaries and have no way of knowing what in hell is in the nice
software, but Unix people have a responsibility to themselves and the others
on their machines/networks to at least check that everything is ok. If they do
not have the expertise, they will hear of it soon enough when others scan the
offered code.
Having source code to these programs is essential, from a security and snub
the TLAs point of view. People need to be educated how to write systems
to use crypto and they need to be able to check no trojans are included.

In secure or commercial networks, the onus is on making sure holes are not

Better to include in the clients a list of all slaves and have the initial
contact to a slave random, maybe weighted by network proximity, and either
have the clients cycle to each slave with each ACK, or have the slave TELL
the clients what server to ACK to next, based on slave to slave balancing.
Slaves could tune their pointers to faster slaves and transparently handle
crashed slaves
The idea is to have all the slaves working evenly, assuming they are on equal
nets and equal machines. If not then you can have the slaves tell clients to
only point to a weaker slave once in a while.
I dont think advertising the master is a good idea, better to have the slaves
talking to it only. A backup mirror master would be worthwhile too.
Web people would most likely have to communicate with the one central http
server as you have to Keep It Simple for them.

The maths of ecash and web pages gets very interesting very quickly. If you
charge per page of a web server, $0.01 a page and you happen to be doing this
on a million-hits-a-day web server then you machine is earning you $10,000 ecash bucks a day. How much is it to buy hardware and a link and set up
a nice web site everyone wants to visit? If it was left running you'd collect
$3,650,000 ecash bucks anually. That is just for browsing. Sales on top of that
via ecash (very low overheads relative to physical means) would mean very
high profits. 1% of browsers spending US$50 is US$500,000 a day, or per year
it is US$182,500,000. Not bad for an outlay of a couple of fast SPARCs and
a quick net link and some staff to maintain it.
If you toss arguements like this at some of the sites that would be viable for
the hit numbers and then explain the only way that will occur is if the crypto
laws are repealed, you will create a lot more lobbiers annoying their reps
for the cause. ecash without good crypto is like the Federal Reserve
deliverying cash with open pickup trucks. Or doing credit card purchases on

My point was (and I failed to mention it :) that to protect against stolen
funds you need to encrypt the transactions using strong crypto. Amongst US
juridictions this is possible so long as you license the technologies... so
be it. The achilles heel for global secure business from the US is the ITAR
limitations. This weakens the crypto to levels that are breachable by quite
a lot of people.  As machines get faster and the ITAR laws keep the MTTB
(Mean Time To Break) down it will become more and more efficient to collect
and exploit electronic cash or credit cards.
In other words, if you want to run a trusted global electronic cash based
business then you need strong crypto otherwise someone will break your
transfers and therefore reputation and noone will want to do business with
you over the inet. At the very least it will cost you PR $ to curb any
damage done. Just ask Netscape.
You can live fine with the 250 million people in the US buying your product,
but with 5 billion potential users out there globally, (with various degrees
of connectivity), it makes sense to enable them to buy from you too.
Off topic:
Personally I dont see the relevance of ITAR and crypto any more. When was the
last time any one was prosecuted under its statutes? What is the point of
banning exportation of software which is widely available outside the US
anyway? It's idiocy. Any foreign power or cartel wanting secure comms is not
going to balk at using any method that can, irrespective of its legality
in the eyes of the US. With their resources they can construct secure OTP
systems by sending in people with a couple of "music CDs" in their briefcase.

Indeed. With the huge amount of people that dislike m$ I think we will at
least double the amount of persons wanting to do their bit to rub their
noses in it.  Whats needed is someone to reverse engineer a m$ transfer,
according to the published specs, isolate the encrypted section and then
produce a brute engine which can be ported to the platforms we want to try.
For the person that cracks a session using the brute force program in the
next brutefest and provides the key, I will give a US$50 international money
order to. I'm sure others will pile t-shirts on you as well.
IMHO we owe Netscape some counter pr against m$, we've proved our point to
Netscape and they performed admirally by being open and responsible to the
net.community. Whilst it didnt seem to dent their share value, they did cop
some bad press (and some media weenies still think their product is broken)

People do record their incoming and outgoing email. Smart ones will store it

Mostly though the cleartext email files will be happily archived away each

This is also a situation on PC and Mac POP clients. They can be configured to
record your email as it goes in and out. Here we also backup the PC's each

Me, I just nuke any sensitive information that may arrive in my work mbox,

God help us all.
I am probably biased against the media in general, relying on them to present
a balanced and unbiased by the reporter, editor or media ownership is a tall
task for them. They are too quick to jump into the sensationalist angle and
disregard the overall view and truth.
For cypherpunks to get the proper facts and implications (subjective I guess)
into print, it's usually the case that any communication with the press has
to be very clear, concise, unambiguous and to the point. If you give them any
chance to wander off the rails they will take it and distort your words
according to their agenda. Once that happens it's usually the case the
article is scoffed at for a week or so and then forgotten until it's dragged
up later as someones point for whatever they want to support in their
If there are good articles out there then it's usually the case the reporter
actually went and took the time to investigate their subject matter and
gather all points of view and to verify as many facts as they can. You say
Markoff does this, I dont agree he does. Then the editor has to keep their
big red pen out of it enought so the message isn't distorted. This doesnt
occur often IMHO. You're better off purchasing space in the paper yourself
and getting it said your way.
It's because of this dilema that a lot of the people I communicate with, and
who have the information people should know, choose to avoid and shun any
media contact. They dont want to be linked with some lame ass report.

A more cypherpunky type of application would be to enable anonymous

they could move to another ISP and reconnect to the anon.net as normal.
(Didnt I just read this in a spam HOWTO?)
The problem I see is when a LEA gets involved and snoops your wires and
traces you back to your starting point and then traces the client that is
supplying nasty httpd services. You wouldnt necessarily be aware of this

How do you propose to protect entities wanting to utilise this function from

b) the above LEA attack where your own lines are monitored and data is tracked
   back thru the various networks to the web page maintainer?
c) an open LEA confrontation where they issue a warrant demanding any and all
   info you have on the web page maintainer. (e.g. co$ doesnt like whats on
   one of the pages)
The same again for the anon shell accounts.
Apart from a once off mailed to you via remailer, the creator of a web page
needs to maintain their creations. This implies a means of accessing it that
is repeatable. Wether thats via a dialup account or over the net, it can be

Personally I would be attracted to a fly-by-night remailer that was only up
for a short period of time. This is based on the [reasonable] assumption that
when the remailer is taken down, then any existing logfiles are also toasted.
A 30 minute remailer could exist by advertising in a known pool of billboards,
advertising it's service, free or for cyberbucks for the next 30 minutes
only. People wishing to send anon email would scan the current remailers,
do a nym check for a superficial check of reliable message delivery, then
negotiate with the mailer to ensure it is still accepting, and then deliver
the message. Less than 30 minutes later the remailer is gone and your message
is queued up or sent as per the contract.
Any LEA/monitor/Co$ would have a hard time trying to suppoena records from
a program that removed all traces of itself within minutes of it running.
If the mail isnt delivered you can choose to bad bad on the nym to the
relevant nym rating services. If it is you can allocate kudos to the nym's
good name.
You could use the "2 cyberbucks for 30 minutes" remailer as your front end
into the pool or the final delivery point or whatever your preference.
People could start off their day in the morning by clicking to download a
remailer (suitably signed) to their machine for a bit of cash earnings during
the time they will be away in a meeting. Heck java could do this =). No need
