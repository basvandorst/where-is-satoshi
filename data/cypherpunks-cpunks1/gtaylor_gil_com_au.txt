@_subject: Newt's phone calls 
After following this thread for some time, I have to question whether
Americans realise how far behind the rest of the world they are in
cellphone technology.
Most of the world has been using GSM digital technology for some years
now, with automatic international roaming, unless you travel to the USA.
No one in their right mind uses an analogue mobile phone any more if they are concerned about eavesdropping.  The Newt incident simply could not happen with GSM.
Of course in most countries the government controls the federal police, not the other way round.  Brisbane Australia

@_subject: Anyone have info on foreign "ITARS" 
The Australian regulations are available at:
CUSTOMS (PROHIBITED EXPORTS) REGULATIONS - SCHEDULE 13    AUSTRALIAN CONTROLS ON THE EXPORT OF DEFENCE AND STRATEGIC GOODS:
   Crypto software comes under Part 3, Category 5/2 of these regulations.
(These documents are in MS Word format)
ADFA, for those who are not aware, is the Australian Defence Force
Academy, the major tertiary training institute for the defence forces.
I have an extract of the key clauses of these regulations if anyone is
Briefly, the Australian regulations ban cryptography exports, claiming
responsibilities as a party to the Wassenaar Arrangement, although the
actual details of the latter regarding crypto seem obscure.  However, an
export license can be obtained on application to the Defence Ministry.
The conditions of such a license are not openly stated, and at least
one Australian software company has been refused a license.
It would seem that even "public domain" software such as PGP is covered
here.  Ironically, the international version of PGP is available from the ADFA site at:
     ftp://ftp.adfa.oz.au/pub/security/pgp263i/
The government attitude to crypto policy generally in Australia is much
more relaxed than in the USA.  There is a recognition of business and personal
need for strong crypto and that a balance needs to be sought between those
needs and that of the law enforcement community.  Although key escrow has
been raised as an issue in some circles, it has not formed part of any government policy as yet.
