@_subject: NSA Turns To Commercial Software For Encryption (fwd from  
50 years does sound like a reasonable figure for computing power and the ability to brute force a crack on anything encrypted. If one is lucky the actual time limit will be around 500 years , but with computing power increasing , its possible that what ever was encrypted 10 years ago , is now in danger of being cracked. And for some things ,there is no statute of limitations.

What an aggravating show , most disapointing. But then I am not really
surprised. On the one side ,you had persons from EMI , Mavrick , and Ira
Dean from some country band , and on the other , you had John Perry
Barlow from the EFF , as Well as Chuck D. The show was moderated by Leo
Laporte ,and interviews done by Mickela Perria(sp).
So , the usual suspects spouting their own opinions ,and party lines.
The upshot is that the recording industry is still fighting a rear guard
