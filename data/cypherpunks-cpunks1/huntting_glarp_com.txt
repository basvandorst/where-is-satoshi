@_subject: Security Dynamics 
The MIS department where I work has started using "Secure-ID" cards
made by Security Dynamics Inc for access to their MVS systems.
After listening to a presentation by marketing droids and technical
support from Security Dynamics I had these impressions:
You can probably imagine some of the problems with such a system.
First and foremost in my opinion, it uses an unknown proprietary
algorithm which is a closely guarded company secret known only to
them and anyone which a dissasembler.  Obviously such an algorithm
has never undergone any serious scrutiny.  Most respectable
researchers (outside of Ft Meade) do not need to disassemble code
to find material to write papers on.
Second, the cards are programmed at the factory, and the user has
no way of reseeding them.  The company actually touts the fact that
they have all the card info for all customers on file, and will
gladly send you encrypted tapes or floppys if you loose you database!
Of course they will only talk with one designated contact at your
site, and they will only ship materials to that person.  In all
fairness if your a big client, and you insist, they might be
compelled to tell you how to seed the cards, and give you a batch
of "raw" cards.
When I mentioned how ludicrous it was for us to trust their internal
security, they made some lame noises about employees being "bonded".
In other words, they have established plausible denyability and
are "out of the loop" should your security data be compromised.
I was a little furious.
Lastly, their expensive.  Something on the order of $60/card in
quantities of 250 to 500 for cards that last 3 years and change
every 60 seconds.  Programmable DES devices (used by DEC and others)
which employ a challenge response system are about one third as
I came away from the talk with a bitter taste in my mouth.  As I
understand it (and please correct me if I'm wrong) they are, at
this point, one of the largest companies "crypto card" companies
in the world.  This is, to say the least, unsettling.

There's a definite advantage in using multipart/* to separate
signatures from the plain-text they apply to because then you can
easily encode the signatures with base64 while encoding the text

But I can put a MIME message headers in a PGP message.  And (though
I haven't tried it), I should be able to specify that application/pgp
messages will be piped through a command like "pgp -m|metamail" or
"pgp -m|mhn -file /dev/stdin".  Unfortunately, I've had problems
redirecting pgp's stdin and stdout.  I'm not sure that it opens
Also, since you bring up PEM-MIME, what could be done to bring PGP
and PEM closer together?  I'm not suggesting changing the web of
trust model or using DES instead of IDEA.  Just make the formats
similar enough so that an application implementing one could be
painlessly modified to implement the other.
A common format wouldn't seem to be all that difficult to implement.
Since some folks want to use triple DES and others IDEA, add this
info to the RSA encrypted portion of the message.  This has the
advantage of hiding not only the key used to encrypt the body of
the message, but the algorithm as well.
As for the trust models, there not so different in theory, just in
practice.  PEM is planing on using X.509 type certificates, and
they are having problems figuring out how to map X.500 Distinguished
Names (DN's) onto e-mail addresses (I think they're making the
problem allot harder than it is).
Perhaps the model for future PEM/PGP systems is to keep both private
key rings, and public key rings with the latter being found in the
(Internet) X.500 directory.  This would nessesitate being able to
sign a private key with a public key, and vice versa.

Imagine if your government decided to outlaw deadbolts on font

executing "no knock" search warrants.  But then to make you feel
safer, they make "breaking and entering" a felony worthy of 15
years in prison, even if nothing is stolen and no one assaulted.
In America cops often use armored battering rams to execute knock
warrants.  Similarly, they can use court orders to obtain keys to
decode encrypted transmissions or files.  If a person is ordered
to turn over their password to unlock their documents, they can be
held in contempt if they don't, and they can demand their right to
not have any of the documents used against them if they do.
In America at least, there are no new civil liberties to be found

While stopping terrorists may be easier in a country with pre-taped
communications, and organizing otherwise undetected insurrection
will be a little closer to possible, this is not the main purpose
of wiretaps today or in the future.
The real targets of wiretaps (now and in the future) are political
activists.  Anyone who poses a serious threat to large corporate
profits is a target for a wire tap.  This includes organizations
like Greanpeace, the communist party, CISPES, and even libertarians
who oppose superfluous military intervention.
Sure, blowing up the world trade center costs money, but cutting
arms sales to Indonesia just because of some little genocide on an
island with only a few hundred thousand inhabitants...  That cuts
into profits; especially if it catches on.
In the past, if Dow wants to put a tap on my friend's mom's phone
(a prominent anti-pesticide activist), they can just hire a private
investigator to climb the poll and sift through the conversations.
No, they never found out who was taping the line, for some reason
they didn't think to ask the guy who came around once a week to
change the tapes on top of the pole (go figure).
In the world where Clipper is predominant, the government will have
a monopoly on this sort of activity.  Two things are clear to
follow:  First, there will be fewer PIs able to do wiretaps.  People
chasing after abducted children or forgoten alimony cheques will
be out of luck.
Second, the government will be pressured into taking on the activities
that are now done by PIs (at a substantially greater cost of course).
This will force some relaxing of the rules governing obtaining
escrowed keys.
Since anyone purchasing the key escrow devices will have implicitly
agreed to (amongst other things) wave any expectation of privacy
associated with using the device, they probably wont have to much

the costs for information are incured by the ones that produce and
diseminate it.  I for one will fight long and hard to insure that
usenet stays free and does not sink into the same myopic sluge pit
that corporate press wades through.
It's very importaint that usenet be free for anyone to post.  It's
also becoming nessesary to have good noise filters on the readers

But the idea that it will replace the Internet is nothing more than
a telco wet dream.  Unfortunatly most telco data networking types
(an oxymoron) really think that Internet can be replaced by ATM
(as opposed to IP over ATM which is a viable posibility for future
high speed networks).

@_subject: CERT Funding 
The main gripe most people have about CERT is that they are way
slow.  Could it be that they systematically inform some parties
before others, and that it just so happens that the public at large
is the last to know and the US intelegence community is the first?
Just another paranoid supposition...
Dont let it keep you up at night, :-)

Regardless of their technical expertiece, federal law enforcment
agents must always be accompanied by local police.  Otherwise they
are out of their juristiction.  DC and other "teritories" are
probably excempt from this.

I think a simple key seeded MD5 work work fine for garage doors:
The remote can transmit: (n, M(n^k))
Where n is random (and so doesn't repeat often), k is a shared key
known only to the remote and the door opener, and M is a reasonably
strong hash function.  k could be set by a bank dip switches, but
to get a large enough key space would require alot of switches.

Several years ago (like mid or early 80's if I recall), there was
just such a program for marking children.  It involved implanting
a "microchip" on the surface of a tooth.
I remember hearing about it on one of those "human interest" stories
that air on slow news days when the local TV stations burn through
the local police blotter and government press releases too quickly
and need to kill time with unimportant trivia lest they mention
something that actually matters.
Unfortunatly, that's all I remember about it.

Gee Tim...  I think we might have to send you back to the indoctrination
center for some vocab' rehabilitation.  After all, there are probably
children reading this list.
If I recall (and it's been a couple years since I read this),
Vonnegut makes the argument that the whole concept of obscenity
and it's censorship is a Victorian thought control device.  Whether
it's TV executives putting per hour quota's on forbidden words, or
yokeles getting _Lysistrada_ pulled from highschool classics courses,
it's censorship and it's obscene.
Heaven forbid!
Indeed, chain them to the bed and put bricks on their heads.
Think about it Tim...  When I saw Vonnegut speak at C.U. in the
80's, he spent the majority of his speech damning the christian
right for it's neo-victorian book banning activities.
P.S.  Thanx for the correction, it's Vonnegut (two n's) and _Palm
Sunday_, not "Psalm".  All other spelling errors are deliberate
can be placed with extreme prejudice in the offended readers

Curious, David Skaggs (R-CO) while arguing against having the Rocky
Flats Grand Jury testify before congress on they're findings pointed
out that congress can only offer immunity from prosecution for a
testimony _about_ crimes they may have committed.
In Shimomura's case the crime was committed in front of congress
as _part_ of his testimony.  One could easily argue, as Skaggs did,
that congress oversteped it's bounds by asking a witness to commit
a crime.  Then again, they're the ones who decide what most of
these crimes are in the first place.
Sorry to stray off topic.
