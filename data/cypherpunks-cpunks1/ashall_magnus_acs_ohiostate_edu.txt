A brief comment. Anyone who was fooled was a dimwit. If I remember
correctly, Tim's "encrypted GIF" was about 80 lines long. This isn't
large enough for a stick drawing, let alone kiddie porn.

@_subject: META:Digital Signatures 
Is there anyway for the list software to incorporate digital signatures
as  verifying the poster is a list member?
I know Tim posted a whistle-blowing trial balloon, and I have used my
anonymous acct to post here. It would be nice if the software used
digital signatures to verify list members regardless of their actual
origin of posting. Presumably the signature recognition base would be
seperate from the names base.
This is primarily directed to the Extropians mailing list, but overlaps
to cypherpunks. What I am considering is that a user could chose to
only accept digitally verified postings. That would eliminate noise
like subscription requests. It would also "verify" anonymous postings
as being from a "valid" (as in list member) source.
I know there are some problems such as maintaining anonymity, but I think
verifying would have some interesting and positive results. We could trade
HeX shares based on signatures, not names. That would eliminate the element
of personality (or some of it) contest. Some one who is considered persona
non gratia could redeem themselves with a series of high quality, but
anonymous posts.

I agree with Perry. The original query was not 'how can I be cool and
use PGP to write secret notes?' It was a serious enquiry about PGP and
*other* similar systems. Reading a fringe popularization about PGP
will not do much. (And I consider Paco to be a competent general writer.)
Using PGP is about as easy as using DOS. Understanding PGP, its capablities,
its strengths, how it relates to other crypto systems, and evaluating it
and other systems is not so easy. It doesn't require 'an advanced degree
in mathmetics,' but just high school algebra won't do it either. I have
seen FringeWare and, while the treatment is PGP is fine as a tutorial, it
is not an introduction to public key cryptography. It wasn't meant to be.
There is a big difference between having people just use PGP and having
them understand it. I know since I have worked several pieces to explain
public key crypto for a general audience. If someone really wants to
learn about the subject, the PGP docs are the best place to begin. From
there, the sci.crypt FAQ, and then, if you are serious, Denning's
_Cryptography and Data Security_. A deep and complex topic like cryptography
requires as deep and complex study as the scholar wish to apply. That can
mean a lifetime. A fluff, yet hip, article in a cool, yet sophisticated
fringe journal is *not* the place to begin.
Perry doesn't need my defense, but I will add that this mostly-lurking
cypherpunk doesn't think he is an asshole. He is brutally honest and
declares his opinion. I respect that. While he is often a bit wired,
I have yet to see any hostility to those who didn't deserve it. (
cf recent extropians/pagans love-in or alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children)
I apologize for excessive re-quoting, and hope someone will forward a good
crypto reference list to the original inquirer. I would, but I can't find

@_subject: Crypto Credentials 
Maybe it's just you, Tim...
This touches on what bugs me the most about the Net and why I post very
little. People are too goddamn sensitive. Too many people sit around with
a massive chip on their shoulder. I really have no idea why. I can't
imagine that *all* of these people have never really experienced
the hothouse atmosphere of hard-core problem-solving or brain-storming
where one is often curt, harsh, hostile, obscene, etc during the exchange
of ideas with no ill-effects later. Maybe people need to play rugby or
soccer more. You know, kill one another for an hour and have a beer to
laugh about it after. Maybe that brewski after is what is missing on the
The reason I am rambling on this here is that I also see a relation to
cypherpunk technology. Is the relatively anonymous technology of the
Net (faceless at least) causing people to forget the "polite  society"
which greases the skids of human contact? Will it be worse with even
more anonymity? (To be fair to the anonymous posters here, I have seen
no decrease of politeness from their quarter. When I have posted under
my pseud, I have not been impolite either.)
It would seem that we are still ape-like enough to need to see real teeth
in that smile and not ASCII ones. I know we mostly like to talk tech
on this list, but most of us see cypher-tech as a road to specific social
goals. (see Tim's .sig) This tech does and will have social impact even if
we are not sucessful in this agenda Part of the cypherpunks "job" needs to
be to anticipate and help guide the social changes. Step one needs to be
adapting homo sapiens to this new means of communication.
BTW- I will stand by D. Denning's book as a crypto primer. It is a little
outdated but, IMHO, is still the best starting point.

@_subject: PGP and Offline Mail/News 
A while ago some one here (from England) mentioned a program he was
involved with that was an offline mail reader that allowed one to add
external protocols like PGP. He gave an FTP site (also in England).
The program was called something like APPNEWS. I downloaded it,
looked at it, and archived it until I could put time into installing
it with my connection and work out the bugs of dynamic addressing.
Now was the time, but I have lost the program. Please help me.
Perry queried earlier about what off-line readers people use. I use
Pop-mail and Eudora, but neither are really friendly with adding
externals. The problem I want to overcome is providing multiple users
on a single machine with security. Pop-mail and Eudora are designed to
be used by a single user and a personal (hopefully secure) machine.
The solution currently implemented is to have users save mail only to
floppy. Both mailers will create personal directories, but these can be
accessed both within and from outside the program. I would like to add
PGP (or another scheme) so that *all* saved messages (or ones so desired)
are encrypted. This would use the user's password and would be automatic.
