@_subject: CoS supoenas records of all anonymous remailers? (Unverified) 
Thank you, Declan.  Grady is a sharp guy and he spent hours with the church lawyers.  If he thinks this is likely to happen I would take the possibility seriously.  I sent the note to Jim Warren because I thought the community should know of the possibility.  A little advance notice might enable someone to prepare a legal defense.  I hope that remailers will resist turning over their records even if there is no useful information in them.  We'll probably know in a few days whether Grady's guess is correct.  Meanwhile, if you are going to pass my letter around please snip the personal stuff.
