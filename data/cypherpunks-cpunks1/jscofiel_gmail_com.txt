messages, lots of information can be inferred through various forms of

One strategy might be to consider the adoption of a time delayed email
system.  The reason why the use of such a mechanism to allow someone the
ability to write an email, and then have it sent off at a specified (or
randomly generated unspecified) date is useful for multiple reasons.
If a program could be coded in a way which could delay the actual
transmission of data in such a manner that the original time of creation
was adequately masked, it could hamper nefarious metadata collection of
time-stamping and possibly geo-locating of user information.
For example:
A person walks into a computer café at 10am and sets an email to send at
around 4am the following morning (via cloud or machine).  The data gets
sent at 4am when the building is empty.  No CCTV photos/cameras are able to
document who sent the message because the computer café is unoccupied at
4am.  The software is designed in such a fashion that it is nearly
impossible to unmask the original time when the message was instructed to
send, thus hiding the metadata associated with time-stamping, and thus
hiding the true identity of the computer user at the café at 10am the
previous day.
Any and all feed back regarding this idea is welcome.

Possibly, I will defer to the more technically learnt.
I'm not a nym server expert but from my laymen perspective the Pynchon Gate
design looks good. It might be totally redundant and unnecessary but if
metadata analysis is the concern, wouldn't such a setup be even more secure
by coding something so that the time between sending a message and
receiving a reply which in theory could leak information about the nym
holder, be sent at a random date in a given time-frame (unbeknownst to the
metadata leeches) . i.e. In 6-12 hours from the moment I click "send" or
say in 12-20 days etc.
The email message could be coded to send at random like an online roulette
table ball, within a given time window: verses say reloading every 24hours.
This would in theory give out incorrect message 'sent' time-stamps, or
would this be unnecessary because trafﬁc from the user to the email
distributors is already being controlled by the user, which queries into
intervals anyway? Is that not metadata that can be tracked?
