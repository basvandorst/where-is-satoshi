@_subject: HOW TO FAKEMAIL 
I'm new to this list and am sorry if this is a frequently asked question.
Can someone tell me how "fakemail" works and how to do it.  I need to send mail
to the "ftp by mail" server at decwrl.dec.com and want the host to think that
it is from another address.  Basicly, I want to send it my ftp request from one
e-mail address and have it mail what I'm requesting to a different one.  The
only way that I know of to do this is with fakemail.
Any suggestions?
