@_subject: Why get an original watch? 
Hello Rowena
How about buying yourself a two Bvlgari watches the same day? It's not impossible, mostly when you can get them for a couple hundred bucks
With top notch customer service and super warranty, we stand behind our watches.
Our Bvlgari have Weights/feels and looks exactly same as original.
