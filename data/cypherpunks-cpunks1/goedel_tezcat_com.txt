Most credit card companies ship their registration information off shore to
low tech developing countries. The idea is that the people entering the
information are unlikely to be able to exploit the information they are
exposed to.
Capturing a set of credit card tapes is certainly profitable, as would be
capturing large volumes of numbers, as you suggest. Now, are those West
African credit fraud rings dialing up DEC, SUN, and SGI? :-)
P.S. There could be an article in tomorrows WSJ about the SSL Challenge.
The technical details and facts will surely be mangled. :-(

@_subject: SSL Challenge - Some thoughts 
1. What kind of pseudo random number generator does Netscape use?
2. If it is a cryptographically secure sequence, doesn't that run up
against ITAR restrictions?
3. Can we improve upon the brute force algorithm in a non-probabilistic way?
4. If we are happy with a 5% yield, we can restrict ourselves to the same
5% of the key space for each message.

Thats pretty much the spin on page B3 of the WSJ. I'll type it in when I

I'd we willing to set up a "crackweb" mailing list, or perhaps a site to
register your machine(s) with % available and MIPS ratings.

I talked the guy out of using an analogy with physical key length (the kind
you stick in a door) and he settled on "10^26" rather than a power of 2.
Also, I gave hime the relevant names, e-mail addresses, and URL's, but
didn't have any phone numbers.
BTW, in the "cryptography experts and hackers and mathematicians" as well
as the whole "hacker" slant, smells like an editor.

Many people have suggested improvements to the techinical side of brutessl.
I don't think anyone has looked at the user interface side of things. A
simple configure script, and a few more reasonable defaults would bring
quite a few more volunteers. I know of at least a handful of people who did
not contribute because they were overwhelmed by the unfriendly scripts.
While a rough user interface could serve as a basic intelligence test, I
don't think that this sort of exclusion is necessary, given the nature of
the task.

@_subject: Java insecurity - long - argumentative - you are warned. 
This "checking," as any comp-sci undergrad will tell you, amounts to solving
the halting problem for the java interpreter. While this is possible for a
finite state automata like the java interpreter (made more difficult by the
fact that it can use the "net" for additional state), it is not even
remotely feasable.
If you can write a checker that works in a reasonable amount of time, I'll
write a turing machine simulator that'll do something nasty if the input
machine halts. Then we'll split the fame and fortune for solving the 5 state
Busy Beaver problem. Deal?

(drifting wildly off topic...)
Consider me exhibit A that speaking only German in the home until age 17
does not diminish ones language skills. In fact, (drifting...) it was only
until I began speaking English to the exclusion of German that my language
skills began to decline.

@_subject: Need ideas. NFP to monitor law enforcement on the net. 
Dear cpunks,
after reading several articles about government sting operations in the US
and Bavaria, I'm thinking of starting a not for profit to collect and
diseminate information on law enforcement on the net. I know how to register
a NFP Corp, and certainly know about mailing lists and web pages, but other
problems still remain to be solved. Specifically:
1) Is it better to be a national or state registered NFP? (Given the level
of LEA hassling I might experience.)
2) What if I start a mailing list and nobody shows up? Whose participation
should I ensure so that the effort is a success.
3) What are some good sources of information for LEA's on the net?
Any suggestions would be most welcome.

I should mention that the literate programming mailing list somehow died
when it moved to comp.programming.literate. Something about the nature of
usenet took the life out of it.
Besides, does anyone want the inevitable "How can I get my Win95 PC to run
doom?" questions?

@_subject: Cypherpunks Press release 
We've seen the word "hacker" kicked around rather arbitrarily in the press.
Are we to conclude that the cypherpunks are a bunch of hackers? I think its
time for some cypherpunks spin. How about a logo *and* a press release? The
press release would give contacts (email, phone, etc.) so that someone on
this list would be contacted by journalists when a crypto story breaks.
If we get enough volunteers, we can fax blanket every newspaper, station,
and network in the world.

You can plunk a nasty url into the SRC field of an IMG tag, thus eliminating
the need for clicking on the offending url. Also, it makes it harder to
check the html of a page. Check out html if you feel like rebooting.

@_subject: Representations of Pi, etc. 
Since we're talking about digits rather than numbers, I can see why base to
some power of 2 might turn out to be significant. The trivial base 2 or 16
to base 10 conversion isn't useful if you're working with a single digit. A
well, its fruitless to guess without looking at the result. Let me close by
saying that in decimal notation, not a single digit of Klarner's Konstant
is known. Not really relevant, but its as close a chance as I get to
mentioning my research. :-)
