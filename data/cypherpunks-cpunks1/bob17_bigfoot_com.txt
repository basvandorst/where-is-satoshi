@_subject: The rumors ARE true 
Hi If you follow business journals you may have heard about a new  phone company that has patent pending technology that will revolutionize   the the way we communicate.
They are using technology that allows us to use our existing phones in a manner similar to the the way we communicate on the internet now.  This is causing the long distance rates to tumble to low prices that have been unheard of  before this.
What's more this new technology will eventually allow us to offer an unlimited usage low flat rate plan as well as being able to have up to 8 phones, computers or fax machines all working off of one phone line at the same time.  All this without having to purchase any new phones or equipment.
This technology is so advanced that the Richard Marriott family of Marriot Hotels has invested 74 Million Dollars in the company for just a 38% interest in the company. If you would like more information on the service or business opportunity
with this new company just send an e-mail to" mailto:bob17 at bigfoot.com" with the words"the rumors are true" and I will send you information right away.
