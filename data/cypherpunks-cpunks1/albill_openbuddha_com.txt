I'm affiliated but we are mainly just gathering people now to get the money together. Our email list is the best way to talk to folks.

Oh, I'm pretty sorry I upset you, Al. Tell me, please, Whose boots you

Any that make you grow up into a human being that isn’t an asshole?

Frankly, you sound like an angry 19 year old who lives with his mom.

Your mechanism for breaking Tor since that paper apparently contains all that you need to do so. Quick, show us your work or are you just some guy bitching on the Internet?

aka “I’m jealous that you have all the data and don’t care if anyone gets hurt by it being dumped unredacted on the net.”
You realize that there are likely things hidden in the data that can get people killed. I know first hand, from a friend who *did* have their data in the wikileaks dump, that at least one of their informants only escaped being killed after it was unveiled because of family connections in the corrupt little nation they were in. 
I hear a lot of sour grapes and jealousy from a few people of “How dare Greenwald not give *me* access to all this data?!?!"

No, the Pacer thing was previous. He was accessing JSTOR’s archive of (often publicly funded) scholastic research with a crawler of sorts. His main mistake seems to have been not rate limiting his requests, which caused so much traffic that he impinged server functionality and got noticed by the sysadmins for JSTOR, who then blocked access. He kept circumventing the blocks, drawing more attention, until they finally figured out who he was, where he’d put his laptop on their network, and arrested him.
