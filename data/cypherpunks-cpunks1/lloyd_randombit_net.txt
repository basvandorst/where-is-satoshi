Still, I liked this quote: '"I came to vote because wasting one's ballot in a

AFAIK most local/state elections have even lower turnout than the recent ones
for the prez. Anyway, you could always have voted for Nader/Brown/Tim May/etc.
Hmmm... that's a thought. Tim May as president. Election slogan: "You're *all*

How well is VoIP going to work over SSL/TLS (ie, TCP) though? I've never used
any VoIP-over-TCP software before, but some people I know who have say it sucks
(terrible latency, sometimes as bad as 5-10 seconds). That may have just been
an artifact of a bad implementation, though. DTLS might be a better pick for
securing VoIP. There's also SRTP.

Well, nothing stopping you from treating your datagram-based VPN (ie, DTLS) as
an IP tunnel, and doing TCP-like stuff on top of it to handle the IM and file
transfer. Actually I'm working on something rather like that now, which may or
not get finished soon.

Anyone know what's up with this? I'm guessing this just means AES, or maybe
Skipjack, but it would be interesting (and very strange) if they were using
BATON or JUNIPER.

So... don't give your account info to organized crime, and don't use Outlook,
and your risk is reduced by, what, 90%? And doing online banking from a Net
cafe... I mean really.
At least some of these numbers seem wrong. If "nearly 2 million" people got
ripped off last year, and "at least 1.8 million" people fell for phishing
attacks, then why would keyloggers/viruses cause "up to half" of the account
compromises? Did nearly a million people fall for phishing attacks and yet were
too stupid to even get their account details correct?

@_subject: The Gilmore Dimissal 
Sometime before early January this year, at least (probably significantly
before). However, from DC Union Station (and probably many other stations),
can use the automated ticket system which 'only' asks for a credit card, no
govt ID needed. And all the conductors care about is if you have a
ticket. Philadelphia's automated system doesn't accept my credit card for
mysterious reasons, so I have had to present ID when buying a ticket there.
I haven't observed them doing any sort of scanning on my ID when I show it;
anyway my ID doesn't have a magnetic stripe like the ones issued by most
around here, just an optical code. They copy down the name at least (shows up
on the ticket), but it's hard to get a good look at their hands as they type,
so it's possible they also grab the state/license # pair, which ties back to
who-knows-what databases.

I wonder if my Model M keyboards (which have individual electrical/mechanical

can imagine that the noise of each key's switch is sufficiently different (due

a) Why do I have the feeling that there is no way to tell which password a
piece of software is asking for when you thumb it. Does the host machine get
all of them and figure out which one it wants to use?
b) How hard is it to bypass the check and simply pull the complete set of
passwords out of it's memory. My guess it "not too fucking hard."
At $50 a piece, they can't have spent too much (if any) on tamper-resitance,
security review, etc. Anyone know how much cheap thumb scanner hardware goes
for in bulk these days?

One would hope that they meant anonymizing the subjects, much the same way some

It's easy. The whistleblower says: if you want more info, post your questions
encrypted with this PGP key I just generated to alt.test.messages with a
subject that contains "Fluffy Bunnies", and I will reply to you. Of course
they'll want to trash that key pretty quickly afterward, since it's "proof"
that they where the whistleblower. Obviously that is more technical that many
journalists could handle, but nothing saying it can't be largely automated with
a web frontend stuck on it.
And don't most/all remailers support responder blocks?

Can't be too short, less than about a third the size of the modulus you start
running into problems [*], which, with the sizes you're suggesting (you would
need, what, a 100K+ bit key to do this?) would make signature generation pretty
slow too.
Easier to do standard RSA and then encrypt the whole thing with a 64 or 80 bit
symmetric key.

@_subject: FW: on FPGAs vs ASICs 
Counter mode works this way, and is a fairly common mode in any case.
Depending on the interconnect it would probably be faster to do it in blocks of
8-64k, doing it a bit at a time would eat your standard PCI bus alive.
There are message authentication modes which can scale 'infinitely' (assuming a
sufficiently long message), and don't depend on the number of functional units,
so for example I could generate a MAC using my regular single core CPU and you
could verify it on a machine with N functional units with a cooresponding
speedup of N (modulo some fixed per-message overhead) without us having to
agree on anything in advance. For example there is the MAC used in Rogoway's
OCB. Unfortunately most (all?) of these algorithms have been patented.
