   [2]Cellphone records reveal the basic pattern of human mobility
   Posted: 11 Jun 2008 12:36 AM CDT
   [3]Mobile phone movement    A few months back, we saw what happens when researchers get their paws
   on anonymixed mobile phone records. Albert-Laszlo Baribasi at the
   University of Notre Dame in Indiana and some buddies used them [4]to
   discover entirely new patterns of human behaviour.
   Now Baribasi has dug deeper into the data and discovered a single
   basic pattern of human mobility.  It's nothing special: lots of
   smallish journeys interspersed with occasional long ones (the length
   of the journey actually follows a power law).
   That's more or less what you'd expect but experimental confirmation is
   important.
   Human mobility is one of the crucial factors in understanding the
   spread of epidemics. Until now, the models that predict how disease
   spreads have had to rely on educated guesses about the way human
   travel patterns might affect this process.
   Baribasi's work will take just little of the guesswork out of future
   efforts and that can't be bad.

   [2]Breakthrough calculations on the capacity of a steganographic
   channel
   Posted: 03 Nov 2008 11:49 PM CST
   [3]Steganography    Steganography is the art of hiding a message in such a way that only
   the sender and receiver realise it is there. (By contrast,
   cryptography disguises the content of a message but makes no attempt
   to hide it.)
   The central problem for steganographers is how much data can be hidden
   without being detected. But the complexity of the problem means it has
   been largely ignored in favor of more easily solved conundrums.
   Jeremiah Harmsen from Google Inc in Mountain View and William Pearlman
   at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy NY, say: "while false
   alarms and missed signals have rightfully dominated the steganalysis
   literature, very little is known about the amount of information that
   can be sent past these algorithms."
   So the pair have taken an important step to change that. Their
   approach is to think along the same lines as Claude Shannon in his
   famous determination of the capacity of a noisy channel. In Shannon's
   theory, a transmission is considered successful if the decoder
   properly determines which message the encoder has sent. In the
   stego-channel, a transmission is successful if the decoder properly
   determines the sent message without anybody else detecting its
   presence.
   Previous attempts have all placed limits on the steganographers
   channel for example, by stipulating that the hidden data, or
   stego-channel, has the same distribution as the cover channel. But
   Harmsen and Pearlman have take a more general approach which takes
   some important steps towards working out the channel capacity over a
   much wider range of conditions.
   The results are interesting and in some cases counter-intuitive (for
   example, adding noise to channel can increase its steganographic
   capacity and in some cases, mounting two attacks on a channel instead
   of one can do the same).
   It's fair to say that Harmsen and Pearlman are pioneering of the study
   of steganographic capacity and that with this breakthrough, the field
   looks rich with low hanging fruit. Expect more!

   [2]Anonymizing data without damaging it
   Posted: 05 Nov 2008 11:39 PM CST
   [3]graph.jpg    If scientists are to study massive datasets such as mobile phone
   records, search queries and movie ratings, the owners of these
   datasets need to find a way to anonymize the data before releasing it.
   The high profile cracking of data sets such as the [4]Netflix prize
   dataset and the AOL search query data set means that people would be
   wise not to trust these kinds of releases until the anonymization
   problem has been solved.
   The general approach to anonymization is to change the data in some
   significant but subtle way to ensure that no individual is
   identifiable as a result. One way of doing this is to ensure that
   every record in the set is identical to at least one other record.
   That's sensible but not always easy, point out Rajeev Motwani and
   Shubha Nabar at Stanford University in Palo Alto. For example, a set
   of search queries can be huge, covering the search habits of millions
   of people over many months. The variety of searches people make over
   such a period make it hard to imagine that two entries would be
   identical. And analyzing and changing such a huge dataset in a
   reasonable period of time is tricky too.
   Motwani and Nabar make a number of suggestions. Why not break the data
   set into smaller, more manageable clusters, they say. And why not
   widen the criteria for what it means to be identical to allow similar
   searches to be replaced with identical terms. For example, replacing a
   search for "organic milk" with a search for "dairy product". These
   ideas seem eminently sensible.
   The problem becomes even more difficult when the data is in graph
   form, as it might be for mobile phone records or web chat statistics.
   So Nabar suggest a similar anonymizing technique: ensure that every
   node on the graph should share some number of its neighbors with a
   certain number of other nodes.
   The trouble is that the anonymization technique can destroy the very
   patterns that you are looking for in the data, for example in the
   [5]way mobile phones are used. And at present, there's no way of
   knowing what has been lost.
   So what these guys need to do next is find some kind of measure of
   data loss that their proposed changes cause, to give us a sense of how
   much damage is being done to the dataset during anonymization.
   In the meantime, dataset owners should show some caution over how, why
   and to whom they release their data.

   [2]Steganophony-when internet telephony meets steganography
   Posted: 27 Nov 2008 09:30 PM PST
   [3]steganophony.jpg    Steganophony is the term coined by Wojciech Mazurczyk and Jzef Lubacz
   at the Warsaw University of Technology in Poland to describe the
   practice of hiding messages in internet telephony traffic (presumably
   the word is an amalgamation of the terms steganography and telephony).
   The growing interest in this area is fueled by the fear that terrorist
   groups may be able to use services such as Skype to send messages
   secretly by embedding them in the data stream of internet telephony.
   At least that's what Mazurczyk and Lubacz tell us.
   The pair has developed a method for doing exactly that called Lost
   Audio PaCKets Steganography or LACKS and outline it on the arXiv
   today.
   LACKS exploits a feature of internet telephony systems: they ignore
   data packets that are delayed by more than a certain time. LACKS
   plucks data packets out of the stream, changes the information they
   contain and then sends them on after a suitable delay. An ordinary
   receiver simply ignores these packets if they arrive after a certain
   time but the intended receiver collates them and extracts the
   information they contain.
   That makes LACKS rather tricky to detect since dropped packets are a
   natural phenomenon of the internet traffic.
   But is this really an area driven by the threat of terrorism? If
   anybody really wants to keep messages secret then there are plenty of
   easier ways to do it, such as Pretty Good Privacy.
   There's a far more powerful driver for this kind of work. It's name?

   [2]Calculating the cost of dirty bombs
   Posted: 24 Feb 2009 09:46 PM PST
   cesium-137
   One of the more frightening scenarios that civil defence teams worry
   about is the possibility that a bomb contaminated with radioactive
   material would be detonated in a heavily populated area.
   Various research teams have considered this problem and come to
   similar conclusions-that the actual threat to human health from such a
   device is low. Some even claim that terror groups must have come to a
   similar conclusion which is why we've not been on the receiving end of
   such an attack. The panic such a device would cause is another
   questions.
   Today Theodore Liolios from a private institution called the  Hellenic
   Arms Control Center in Thessaloniki in Greece, goes through the
   figures.
   He says the most likely material to be used in such an attack is
   Cesium-137, widely used throughout the developed and developing world
   as a source for medical therapies.
   The unstated implication is that it would be relatively easy to get
   hold of this stuff from a poorly guarded hospital. Exactly this
   happened in Goiania in Brazil when an abandoned hospital was broken
   into and its supply of cesium-137 distributed around the surrounding
   neighbourhoods. The incident left 200 people contaminated. Four of
   them died.
   But a dirty bomb would not be nearly as lethal. The trouble with them
   (from a terrorist's point of view, at least) is that distributing
   radioactive material over a large area dramatically reduces the
   exposure that people receive. Particularly when most could be warned
   to stay indoors or be evacuated (unlike the Goiania incident in which
   most people were unaware they were contaminated).
   Liolios calculates that anybody within a 300 metre range of a dirty
   bomb would increase their lifetime risk of cancer mortality by about
   1.5 per cent. And then only if they were unable to take shelter or
   leave the area. That's about 280 people given the kind of densities
   you expect in metropolitan areas.
   And he goes on to say that it is reasonable to assume that a
   cesium-137 dirty bomb would not increase the cancer mortality risk for
   the entire city by a statistically significant amount.
   But the terror such a device might cause is another question. Liolios
   reckons that current radiation safety standards would mean the
   evacuation of some 78 square kilometres around ground zero. That would
   affect some 78,000 people, cost $7.8m per day to evacuate and some
   $78m to decontaminate.
   That seems a tad conservative but however it is calculated, it may
   turn out to be chickenfeed compared to the chaos caused by panic,
   which may well result in more deaths than the bomb itself could claim.
   How to calculate the effect of that?

   [2]How terrorists groups resemble manufacturing firms
   Posted: 21 Jun 2009 09:10 PM PDT
   Terrorist organisations may be best understood as companies whose
   principle product is violence, suggests a new study of terror attacks
   Understanding how terrorist groups operate is hard, not least because
   of a severe lack of information about how they recruit, organise and
   plan their activities. So it's no surprise then that working out how
   best to stop these organisations is tricky.
   Now Aaron Clauset from the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico and his
   pal, Kristian Skrede Gleditsch, say they've found an important new
   insight into terrorist activity that could help to solve this problem.
   The analysis is based on the one set of reliable data that we do have:
   the number and severity of terrorist attacks and rough idea of the
   size and age of the groups that carried them out (they've looked at
   the data from 1998 to 2005). Clauset and Gledistch say that a simple
   analysis of this data shows that the frequency of attacks increases
   over time in a pattern that is common to all groups: the time between
   attacks plotted against the group's experience decreases according to
   a power law.
   That can be explained in two ways. First, terrorist groups are born
   clumsy and increase their attack rate primarily because their members
   learn to be more efficient. In manufacturing industry, this kind of
   organisational learning is called learning by doing and is widely
   studied.
   Second, the terrorist groups are born small and increase their attack
   rate by recruiting new, replaceable, members, a process called
   organisation growth and is again well studied by economists.
   Perhaps economics can help. "In this light, terrorist groups may best
   be understood as firms whose principal product is political violence,
   and whose production rates depend largely on organizational growth and
   the availability of low-skill labor," say Clauset and Gledistch.
   That may well be an important insight because it implies that certain
   kinds of easily accessible organisations such as non-profit companies
   and groups of political activists, might be good models of terrorist
   groups from which additional insights can be gained. For example, it
   may be possible to determine whether the activity a group is best
   reduced by limiting its growth or by disrupting its organisation.
   But there is a puzzle in this data, say Clauset and Gledistch. The
   severity of terrorist attacks is independent of the size and
   experience of the organisation. So contrary to what you might expect,
   young and old terrorist groups are equally likely to carry out
   extremely severe attacks. "Internal factors seem to play a marginal
   role in the severity of any particular attack," say Clauset and
   Gledistch.
   Here's one explanation. Similar kinds of power laws are common in the
   real world: in the size of stock market crashes, the number of deaths
   in wars and the severity of forest fires. In these cases, the size of
   the conflagration has nothing to do with the size event that triggered
   it but everything to do with the network in which the event took
   place.
   Perhaps the same is true with terrorist attacks: the severity of the
   attack has more to do with the properties of the system being attacked
   than the organisation doing the attacking.

Wireless network modded to see through walls
Posted: 30 Sep 2009 09:10 PM PDT
The way signal strength varies in a wireless network can reveal what's  going on behind closed doors
It's every schoolboy's dream: an easy way of looking through walls
to spy on neighbours, monitor siblings and  keep tabs on the
sweet jar. And now a dream no longer...
Researchers at the University of Utah say that the way radio
signals vary in a wireless network can reveal the movement of people
behind closed doors. Joey Wilson and Neal Patwari have developed a
technique called variance-based radio tomographic imaging which
processes the signals to reveal signs of movement. They've even
tested the idea with a 34-node wireless network using the IEEE
802.15.4 wireless protocol. This is the protocol for personal area networks  employed by home automation services such as ZigBee.
The basic idea is straightforward. The signal  strength
at any point in a network is the sum of all the paths the radio waves can  take to get to the receiver.  Any change in the volume of
space through which the signals pass, for example caused by the
movement of a person, makes the signal strength vary. So by
"interrogating" this volume of space with many signals,
picked up by multiple receivers, it is possible to build up a picture
of the movement within it.
In tests with a 34-node network set up outside a standard living
room, Wilson and Patwari say they were able to locate moving objects in the  room to
within a metre or so. That's not bad and the team say there is ample
potential for improvement by increasing accuracy while reducing the
number of nodes.
The advantage of this technique over others is first its cost. The
nodes in such a network are off the shelf and therefore cheap. Other  through-wall viewing systems cost in excess of $100,000.
The second advantage is the ease with which it can be set up. Wilson and  say that adding a GPS receiver to each node allows it work out its
own location which should dramatically speed up the imaging process.Other  systmes have to be "trained" to recognise the environment.
Wilson and Patwari have even worked out how their system might be used:
"We envision a building imaging scenario similar to
the following. Emergency responders, military forces, or police
arrive at a scene where entry into a building is potentially
dangerous. They deploy radio sensors around (and potentially on top
of) the building area, either by throwing or launching them, or
dropping them while moving around the building. The nodes immediately
form a network and self-localize, perhaps using information about the
size and shape of the building from a database (eg Google maps) and
some known-location coordinates (eg using GPS). Then, nodes begin to
transmit, making signal strength measurements on links which cross
the building or area of interest. The received signal strength
measurements of each link are transmitted back to a base station and
used to estimate the positions of moving people and objects within
the building."
That's ambitious but shoudl they ge ttheir system to the point where it can  be used like this it raises another problem: the issue of privacy.
The broader issue is how such a cheap and
easy-to-configure monitoring networks might be used if they become widely  available. What's
to stop next door's teenage brats monitoring your every move or house
breakers choosing their targets on the basis that nobody is
Of course, in the cat and mouse game of surveillance,
it shouldn't be too hard to build a device that disables such a
monitoring network. But only if you know it's there in the first
There are fun and games galore to be had with this idea.

How to fix an election
Posted: 20 Sep 2009 09:10 PM PDT
Manipulating election results may not be as hard as previously thought
In recent years, computer scientists have begun an aggressive
program to study elections using both theoretical models and
agent-based simulations. Their motivation is not just that
elections are crucial for the proper functioning of a democratic
society but that elections are playing an increasingly important role
for things like collaborative decision-making, artificial
intelligence and recommendation systems on websites.
So the question of how to fix an election is of some concern. However, one  of the recent key insights is that it is possible to design
election systems that make this kind of rigging NP-hard.
(By fixing, computer scientists mean either the blatant adding and
deleting of votes/candidates or the more subtle strategy in which
groups of voters change their allegiances to achieve a specific
This result gives succor to those who worry that elections can
easily be fixed. What it means is that rigging is so complex that it
is computationally impractical to achieve. It's as if the election
has a built-in shield that prevents fixing.
Now Piotr Faliszewski from the AGH University of Science and
Technology in Poland and a few buddies say they have found a special
case in which this protection vanishes. The special case is in elections
where the vote is dominated by a single issue such as war or
economics. This is known as a single-peakedness.
And the worry is that it may be a common
feature of human elections. In fact, many political institutions seem
designed to achieve single-peakedness and so may be more vulnerable to
manipulation than we imagined.
But it by no means guarantees it. One potential weakness of
Faliszewski and co's approach is that while many human elections are
dominated by a single issue such as defence or taxes, there are
always a few extreme individuals whose vote is determined by some
other issue such as the sex of the candidates or the color of their
It may be that these extreme individuals protect the veracity of
elections by ensuring that the single-peak weakness does not
Faliszewski and co are working on their idea to see if it can be
extended to elections that are almost single-peaked.
Until then, we can but wonder that we may end up relying on extremists to  make our
elections more robust.
