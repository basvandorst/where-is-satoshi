@_subject: "Notes" to be Eclipsed by "Netscape" 
I've used Notes myself (and have written about how it and Notes add-in apps are used).  Yes, it was overpriced, but they came out with a less-featured, less-expensive version (which I haven't seen).  Based on my experiences, it appears to be a choice for rigid/business management/TQM types in big corporations, among others.
No question about that.  You need a dedicated server, server software and, at least a year ago, it all cost something like $500+ per seat to setup.  Plus, it doesn't do you any good unless you are working in a workgroup.
I only just subscribed to this list, and by all rights should probably spend more time lurking; that said, Notes includes encryption and digital signature.
There has been growing sentiment among certain sectors that workgroup computing is the wave of the future.  Unfortunately, given IBM's track record, their purchase of Lotus seems to doom it to a fate similar to OS/2: an excellent product with a track record, with a small but fervent following, which will soon be eclipsed by some less-featured, newer product that makes someone a pot of money (like CollabraShare).
Notes end users have always seemed to feel it had too much power and was not easy to figure out how to use; Notes programmers love it, and there are lots of addins.  With Notes going to IBM, Netscape seems to have made another very clever move--while it still doesn't justify the overall stock price, it does justify the rise associated with that move.
Notes uses replication to distribute data across networks; there are better ways to have people compute remotely in my opinion too (not sure WWW is THE answer, but it certainly is one of them).
