Historically BIST has been more attractive for crypto hardware because you can also use it for assurance testing prior to use.  Invoking it can be
hard coded into device initialization.
If JTAG is present, you don't have to have internal scan.  If you have internal scan  you could have a zeroize on entering test mode.  This prevents scan chains
from being capable of being used to save as well as restore state.  If and when is it a problem?  If you were to examine FIPS PUB 140-2, 4.5 'Physical
Security', 'Table 2 Summary of physical security requirements'  and section:
4.5.1 General Physical Security Requirements
 ...
SECURITY LEVEL 1
The following requirements shall apply to all cryptographic modules for Security Level 1.
* The cryptographic module shall consist of production-grade components that shall include standard passivation techniques (e.g., a conformal coating or a sealing coat applied over the module's circuitry to protect against environmental or other physical damage).
* When performing physical maintenance, all plaintext secret and private keys and other unprotected CSPs contained in the cryptographic module shall be zeroized. Zeroization shall either be performed procedurally by the operator or automatically by the cryptographic module.
Meaning for a cryptographic module boundary at the chip level, the
keys should have been zeroized before physical access.
 ...
SECURITY LEVEL 3
In addition to the general requirements for Security Levels 1 and 2, the
 following requirements shall apply to all cryptographic modules for Security Level 3.
* If the cryptographic module contains any doors or removable covers or if a maintenance access interface is defined, then the module shall contain tamper response and zeroization circuitry. The tamper response and zeroization circuitry shall immediately zeroize all plaintext secret and private keys and CSPs when a door is opened, a cover is removed, or when the maintenance access interface is accessed. The tamper response and zeroization circuitry shall remain operational when plaintext secret and private cryptographic keys or CSPs are contained within the cryptographic
Meaning that physical access will cause zeroization.  This would imply
zeroization on test mode activation on a JTAG interface on a single
chip cryptographic module.   You start getting real security at levels
3 and 4, the  certification criteria comes from the Commercial  COMSEC Evaluation Program (CCEP).
Am I worried someone is producing chips that aren't protected?  No.
I'm more concerned that implementations (systems) aren't properly
designed, tested and certified.  "They got AES, we got AES" is just
a form of snake oil.
