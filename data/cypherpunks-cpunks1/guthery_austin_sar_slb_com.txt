@_subject: IT View of Worldwide Electronic Commerce Conference 
Robert Hettinga wonders ...
I did and here's a view from IT; i.e. not law or marketing.  The conference
was two-track so by definition I only attended 1/2 the sessions.
The high points ...
          down to micro (sub-penny) transactions
          escrow but folks aren't buying it;  Dorthy Denning gave
          a very weak "the sky is falling" talk.
          Microsoft may start to feel trapped between Intel and Netscape.
          contract law may need some updating
          card that does fingerprints including pores which I learned are           better than ridges for identification
          or otherwise

                            - the Swedes have a very aggressive Digital ID system on the air;

          technologies of preference;  PGP was occassionally acknowledged           to be one of the best available but strangely went undiscussed.
          Good quote: "Commercial DES (for export) with 40 bit keys is a                        joke. Don't even think about it."

                                                   Most of the security focus of the conference was on authentication.
