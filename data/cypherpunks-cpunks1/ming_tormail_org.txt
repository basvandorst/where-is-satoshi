@_subject: [tor-talk] LivelyBlog Encourages Tor Users To Blog With Special 
Lively blog[1], a free blogging service, offers a special configuration[2] for Tor users. It's the
first free blogging service on the open web I've discovered which encourages Tor users to join and
blog anonymously. (unlike the .onion sites which require Tor in order to access and usually
experience poor up time and longevity)
