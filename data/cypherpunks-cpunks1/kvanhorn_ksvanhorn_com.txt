You didn't read the "mainstream" account, nor Fisk's account, carefully enough.  Fisk's account was posted at 8:00 a.m. (Iraqi time) on April 4, corresponding to midnight, April 4 in the Eastern time zone, where your "mainstream" U.S. news account (southern Florida Sun Sentinel) of the same day was published. Fisk's account was clearly written many hours earlier than the Sun Sentinel report, which states,
"During the day, the ministry [of information] organized a trip to the airport for reporters in the capital, and they filmed the empty runways and terminals. Yet within hours, artillery and rocket fire erupted in the region and military officials said an assault on Saddam International Airport had begun."
The "empty runways and terminals" is consistent with Fisk's report, which appears to have been filed before the actual capture of the airport took place.
Fisks's report says,
"Only three hours earlier, the BBC had reported claims that forward units of an American mechanised infantry division were less than 16km west of Baghdad -- and that some US troops had taken up positions on the very edge of the international airport.
"But I was 27km west of the city."
That is to say, the mechanized infantry division was 11km to the east of the airport at the time of the BBC report, but that report had been written so as to give the impression that US troops were already attacking the airport.  Even if we discount Fisk's report and only rely on the Sun-Sentinel report, we have to conclude that "some US troops" must have, in reality, been only a very small number of hidden scouts -- not an assault force.
In other words, just as with Umm Qasr, the initial "mainstream" media (BBC) reports gave the impression that the coalition's attack had progressed farther than it actually had. (Umm Qasr was reported under control of coalition forces many days before this was fully achieved.)

His claim was that he couldn't see them, and that even the mainstream reports put them many kilometers away, if you read them carefully.
And, according to the Sun-Sentinel report, it wasn't -- they reported it as empty early in the morning.
Now you are being dishonest. He made no claim about what might happen in the future, only  about what he was seeing at that moment.
This statement is complete fantasy, and corresponds to nothing that Fisk actually wrote in his report.
I don't know much of anything about Fisk, but I now know that *you* cannot be trusted to give an honest report.

Rumsfeld gives press conference on the whereabouts of Saddam Hussein
Doha, Qatar (Routers) In response to questions as to when coalition forces anticipated capturing Saddam Hussein, U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had the following reply:

In spite of thousands of bombs,
I'm sorry to say, yeah,

He's gone to Tikrit to hide,

Do you have some hard data to back up this assertion, or are you just repeating the brainwashing we Americans are fed from at least kindergarten forward?  I don't know of any serious study of economic freedom that puts the U.S. in the number one spot. Every rating I've seen for the past ten years has put the U.S. at number four or worse.
I haven't seen any serious attempt to quantify overall freedom, but even there I still have my doubts that the U.S. would rank number one by any reasonable measure. Yes, the U.S. looks great on paper, with that nice Constitution and Bill of Rights; too bad all those protections have been interpreted out of existence by the Supremes.  Furthermore, the U.S. is the most powerful government in the world right now, which allows them to intrude much more severely into the lives of their subjects than many nominally less-free nations with (on paper) worse laws and fewer legal protections for the rights of individuals.

How can it possibly be treason if there was no declaration of war?
Furthermore, since when is mere travel treason?  If you  could show that he had actually participated in war against the U.S. -- not just thought about it, not just taken leg one of a trip that could eventually get him to a location where he would have an opportunity to do so (if he didn't change his mind first) -- then there could be a case.

"Enemies" are discussed in juxtaposition to "levying War against [the United States]".  This implies
that "Enemies" of the United States are those with whom the U.S. is at war.  Since the Constitution
gives Congress the sole power to declare war, I conclude that "Enemies" in this context can only  be
those entities on whom Congress has declared war.
This also precludes conviction of Hawash, as there was no overt act, only  a claim that his intentions in travelling were to later commit such an act.

Have you  ever heard the phrase, "unconstitutionally vague"?  If "enemies" are something other than parties with whom the U.S. is at war, then who are they?

Think more literally here.  The prisoners are the entire population of accused persons.  If all the accused (in all cases in the Injustice System) were to reject plea bargaining and insist on a jury trial, then prosecutors would be spread more thin, and would not be able to extort confessions as they do now.
Do you have any evidence at all for this assertion?  It seems to me that you've been taken in by Big Brother's propaganda.  On a regular basis I hear about corrupt judges who act as a second prosecutor, and actively prevent the accused from presenting any effective defense by disallowing crucial evidence and even telling them what arguments they can make.  Too often, the prosecution just needs to convict somebody to keep their numbers high, or police need to make arrests because they've allocated a certain portion of the departmental budget to come from forfeitures.

As a former believer and student of the Bible, I can assure you that there is no passage in the Bible that says that Jesus was, will be, our should be the *only* person conceived without the benefit of sexual intercourse. And what do you think in vitro fertilization is, anyway?
Many / most American Christians stress that they rely on the Bible as their one and only source of religious truth.  If so, they have absolutely no *religious* basis for objecting to cloning.

I think your aim is off here.  It's the politicians and political appointees who are agitating for this war, not the career military.  A lot of the top military leadership is against the idea of attacking Iraq, I suppose because they have a keener appreciation of just how dangerous, messy, and unpredictable war can be.

Sorry, but you've got your facts completely wrong here.  Mormons very much consider themselves a Christian church; in fact, they consider their church to be the restoration of the church Christ originally established.  Jesus is a divine figure in the LDS church. He's considered the literal son of God the Father; he's also considered the creator of the Earth, the Jehovah of the Old Testament, and a god in his own right.

@_subject: Defending decentralized societies from military aggression 
Let's take a look at some historical examples.
1. Switzerland during WWII.  While other more centralized nations were easy pickings for the Nazis, the tiny Swiss nation managed to retain its freedom and independence as a small island of freedom in a sea of fascism.  Several factors entered into this, including the Swiss willingness to fight to the bitter end and their long policy of strict neutrality; but one oft-overlooked advantage the Swiss had was their loose confederation and lack of strong central control.  Your average Swiss citizen doesn't even know who the Swiss president is; it's just not that important of a position.  Whereas other countries gave in to the Nazis without firing a shot when the governmental leaders capitulated and ordered a surrender, in the case of Switzerland there really wasn't anybody with the authority to surrender the country... and the fiercely independent Swiss would have disobeyed any orders to surrender, anyway.  (For example, at one point there was some concern among the junior officers in the Swiss military that their higher-ups might be considering capitulation. They formed an organization among themselves with the intention of offing their senior officers and taking over command should any form of surrender be attempted.)
As a result, although Hitler made it clear that he loathed Switzerland, and repeatedly had plans drawn up for its invasion, there were always easier targets and other pressing matters to be taken care of first.  In the meantime, the Swiss observed the German's military tactics and modified their own defense strategy accordingly.  The Swiss maintained their freedom not because they had the military might to defeat Germany; they didn't.  They stayed free because they ensured that the price for conquering them would be unacceptably high, and the gains unacceptably low.
2. Ireland and England circa 1100 A.D.  Ireland was a lawful anarchy; England was more centralized.  When the Normans invaded, it took them not much more than a month to conquer England.  All they had to do was obtain the surrender of the appropriate authorities.  As is often the case, the existing governmental apparatus was then used to administer the occupation.
The conquest of Ireland took 300 years, and some say it was never really completed. Ireland didn't have any central authority that could surrender.  The main form of societal organization was the tuath. The territory of a tuath was the sum of the lands of its members; people could and did change their affiliation from one tuath to another without moving their place of residence.  The tuath "king" was a religious and military leader; he was not a ruler, and had no special powers to make law nor immunity from lawsuit.  This system was an invader's nightmare.  The invaders had to fight for every square inch of Ireland.  Even when a tuath was apparently defeated, the tuath king could only surrender for himself, but not for the tuath members; they were free to join a different tuath.  So effectively, the invaders had to obtain their surrenders one household at a time.
3. Somalia. The world's sole remaining superpower, whose military spending and might exceeds that of the next several contenders combined, was sent packing by the people of a destitute country lacking any significant industrial base and still recovering from a nasty civil war.  The Somalis didn't have to defeat the invader to win; they just had to make remaining in Somalia too politically costly for the invader Clinton.
