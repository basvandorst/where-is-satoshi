If a DRM system is based on X.509, according to Brand I thought you could
get anonymity in the transaction. Wouldn't this accomplish the same thing?

One more thing, there are different types of DRM. For instance you might
want to make sure that only a specific number of accesses to a media
document are made, and no more. A second type of DRM access might be
allowing only one concurrent access, again I'm not sure that this requires
much private information.A third type of DRM might be time limited. You
might also want a DRM access to a specific IP/location. These don't seem to
require private information, unless prosecution is in the model of
