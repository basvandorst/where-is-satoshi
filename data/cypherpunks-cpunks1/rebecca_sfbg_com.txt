@_subject: [liberationtech] San Francisco's "smart" streetlights 
My article in this week's issue of the SF Bay Guardian describes how the
city of San Francisco has initiated two pilot projects for LED streetlights
connected via a wireless mesh network. The test sites are determining how
well the "smart" streetlights can transmit data from traffic cameras and
remotely read electric meters; according to a Request For Proposals issued
last June, future uses could potentially include anything from "street
surveillance" to "gunshot monitoring" to "public information broadcasts."
Thought it would be of interest to people on this list.
