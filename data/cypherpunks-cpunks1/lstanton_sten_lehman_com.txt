What about later Byzantium? The last 100 years of the Ottomans? Most of the
history of the Holy Roman Empire? Capetian France? Egypt under the Mamluks?
There are many examples of a government peacefully becoming incompetent and
weak. Sometimes, an outside power moves in. Sometimes, anarchy results, and
later a strong new government arises. Sometimes, things just muddle along
for a while, with most people ignoring government entirely.
That all of these periods end with the rise of, or takeover by, another
government, proves nothing. Every historical period has an end. Does anybody
here think that the current set of governments in the world is static for
all time? Those who think that governments only get stronger is taking too
short a view. The Babylonian, Roman, and Persian empires were all succeeded
by far weaker, less centralized, power structures.
The questions are: what comes next? And what can we do to make what comes
next bearable?

But you can make a good case that this was BECAUSE the monarchy had not been
drastically weakened and impaired for a time before the revolution. The
revolution was too sharp a jolt, and the system became unstable. Politics
abhors a square wave.

How can you distinguish the marauders and the government? There was an

I would love the purist stance, except that it is untenable. Every security
system is breakable, if enough effort, money, and professionalism are involved.
We should never kid ourselves about this. One time pads are provably secure,
but someone can still break in and physically steal your plaintext, or steal
you and bring out the rubber hoses...
If crypto does become widespread, then it will be used in situations where
the value of the key justifies considerable effort and expense to steal it,
and it will happen. There must always be a mechanism to deal with repudiation.
As to your later point about mootness, I would not be comfortable saying that
there are limits to what a court will attempt to coerce cooperation.

I don't think this is really the purist stance. You defined it as 'you are
your key', and my view is that revocation will have to be possible. All
that your argument above is saying is 'email address and claimed name are
insufficient to prove identity' -- surely no one disputes that?

Yes. And physical possession of them is not generally considered to be

owned them.

In all honesty, I don't see physical key theft to be a major problem
for individuals, since it can generally be made unprofitable. Where I
see legal key revocation as essential, is for corporate situations.
That is where a multi million dollar cost of stealing a key could still
be quite profitable. We need to figure a way to extend web of trust to
revocations and corporate identity.

Unfortunately, I think that the courts will expand too. The courts may not
be able to freeze and confiscate your foreign assets, but they may be able
to block you from doing a great deal of business without very frequent
changes of 'name' and reestablishment of reputation. Also, there is always
the possibility of being hampered in the physical world. We all have to
buy groceries, and the physical means of communication will always be
vulnerable to pressure.
This is not to say that I don't think crypto will weaken government. It
will. Making court rulings effective will be far more expensive than it
currently is.

I don't think so, at least not easily. I think that most countries,

The real problem that I see is getting legal assets out of the control and
monitoring of the US/IRS. Especially without taking a bath in the process.
It is much easier to launder illegal assets than legal ones, and any method
would need to handle NYSE securities to be useful.

I agree of the inheritance tax question, but there is still a problem. The only

US. That will not magically change just because I get citizenship somewhere
else, and that still leaves me liable for US tracking and taxes.

This would be a known plaintext attack, well suited to differential
Though the lifetime of the average garage door opener is probably small
enough that it would die before you had enough plaintext/ciphertext

Lets try a game:
I'm thinking of a number, lets call it my private factor.
I tell you that it is less than some other number, which we'll call my
public key.
For any number you choose, I'll tell you whether your choice is above or
below my private factor.
How long will it take you to guess my factor?
Lets try. my public key is 24.
Is the factor above 10? No.
Is the factor above 5? Yes.
Is the factor above 7? No.
Is it 6? Yes.
And look: 24 / 6 = 4 ! You guessed my private key, and you happen to have factored
my public key at the same time! Wow!
You may not think that you are talking about factoring, but factoring is a
subset of what you are discussing.

Of course it qualifies. No matter how a key gets broken, its
broken. The point is that if a function exists which will tell you if
a given number is larger than the RSA private key, that function can
be used as a factoring algorithm.

No, what it means is that you would have to break most of number
theory, and common sense, before having to worry about such a
function. The risk of exploding in the vacuum caused by all of the
molecules in the air of this room suddenly moving to the far corner is
far higher than the chance of such a function existing.

I like the general idea of distributing the load of moderating a list, but
would make a few changes. Instead of picking a moderator at random, might
it not work better to pick some percentage of the list (say 5%) and then
post the message only if more than half of those chosen as moderators, and
who respond within an hour, approve?
The trouble with random single moderators are many, but worst would probably
be time-delay. If the chosen moderator for a message is busy, sick, or away
from their desk messages could be delayed for days. The problem gets even worse
if a delayed message is then approved, and posted out of sequence.

While the courts can always rule whatever they want to, there are hopeful
signs. I was having dinner with a Federal Judge last weekend, who made the
mistake of asking me "Just what is the internet I keep hearing about." By
the end of the night we had covered everything through the ITAR. The
classification of crypto as munitions struck him as absurd, he liked the
cryptography as an envelope for email analogy, and volunteered that "people
who think only those with something to hide need privacy are fools."
Judges tend to have brains, and are educatable. This is where, ultimately,
the battle for free crypto will be won or lost.

I don't see this as a real worry. Once the use of RSA is legal worldwide, it
is fairly easy to just yank the RSAREF code and drop in functionally
equivalent, but legally unencumbered, code.  Or, everyone in the US/Canada

Absolutly true, but even week security can have its uses. One of the most
useful things we can do is get people used to, and routinely using, encryption.
There are still too many people who think that using encryption is proof
of wrongdoing.
