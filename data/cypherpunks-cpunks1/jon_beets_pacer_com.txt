Hmmm lets see, if I remember right that actually was not an air raid shelter
it was a military hold which the people of the community were told was
"safe" to hide in...  Or am I just to believe that is our own government
Hmm I guess all the Kuwaiti's that the Iraqi's killed brings nothing into
this equation of yours? Including the removal of Kuwati babies from their
incubators so the iraqis could take the equipment.. Oh yea and the Kuwaiti
commanders that were hung at the main gate of Al Jaber AB and their body's
left there for several days for everyone to see..  And before you say that
both of these did'nt happen I have been there twice for several months and
have seen the photgraphs and personally talked to the people that were
witness to it.. It did happen.
Apparently you have never been in the military... Because you have no real
idea how the common soldier is taught or trained.. You probably have all
your training from watching Full metal jacket baout 40 times....
Too bad the government has'nt deprogrammed you yet.... Because your cheese
done fell off your cracker... (Okay so I stole that line from the Green Mile
Ohh I get it so we should'nt mourn over these individuals?   Ok they
deserved it because they were working there... and the kids across the
street at the day care center deserved it too....  Interesting though the
people in waco were given the chance to come out on their own several
times..   Do I believe that the government got together and decided to kill
everyone at the Waco compound? NO... Do I believe the governement made a
mistake at Waco... YES...  Do I believe Timothy McVeigh sought out to kill
everyone he could at the federal bldg... YES..
Now going with your logic... I accidently and by bad judgement caused a
wreck in my car.... I killed some people.. Should I be disciplined..  Most
likely.. Should I die?.. Most probably not.   Now you saw the accident and
decided that because I was working for this certain company when I did it
that your going to take your car and purposely run everyone traveling in
that a company's van off the road and whne you do it you cause a 6 car
pileup killing even more people..  Does this makes sense..  Certainly not..
Unless your insane....
Okay so by your logic again, he should have come by your house and blown you
up too...
Drove him?  Drove him how?   You think the only way to make change in this
country is to do violent acts?  He was not a soldier who malfunctioned.. He
was a man who made a decision and know he must pay for it..  Executions
should be public just like the trials.. Otherwise we are no better than
other countries where even the accused is represented by someone who works
for the government... Hmmm.. I guess you did'nt learn everything you needed
to know about life in kindergarten...
If you wanna make change... Then become a public a voice.... Do you do
anything more than sit in here and talk.. Does change happen overnight..
Hell no....  All that the violence is doing is giving the government more
ammo to say "See.. told ya so"
Probably will.. After all there are thousands of insane people out there...

No More Secrecy Bills
LAST YEAR President Clinton properly vetoed an intelligence authorization bill that would have criminalized virtually all leaks of classified information. Unfortunately, this year the idea has resurfaced and is due to be considered by the Senate intelligence committee in September. The leaks bill is still a bad idea and should again be rejected.
We don't pretend to be neutral on this subject. Newspapers publish leaked material; our reporters solicit leaks. And some of the leaked material we publish is classified. But it is a mistake to imagine that all leaks of classified information are bad. Some expose wrongdoing or allow the public to debate relatively nonsensitive matters that government would prefer to handle without scrutiny. The government massively overclassifies information, so a law banning all leaks of supposedly sensitive material would inevitably criminalize conversations between officials and citizens about subjects that are not genuinely sensitive and chill in dangerous ways the ability of officials and former officials to speak out on important policy questions.
Traditionally, the law has respected this fact and has made criminal only leaks of specific types of classified information -- the names of intelligence agents, for example, or material related to encoding systems used in intelligence work. Certain disclosures of defense information, if done with intent to harm national security, can be prosecuted under espionage laws. And no one is suggesting that every government employee should be free to decide what remains secret and what does not. Generally speaking, leaks are handled under administrative personnel rules; if you get caught, you can lose your job.
One trouble with creating a blanket criminalization of classified leaks is that it gives the executive branch almost unchecked authority to remove information from public discussion. Classification rules are generally not made under statutes but by executive orders, meaning that the president would have the authority both to decide what information is classified and to prosecute people for leaking it. Such unchecked power would be dangerous even if overclassification weren't rampant.
But there is hardly an area where government is more capricious than in its determination of what secrets it needs to keep. Several years ago, to cite one example, the Federation of American Scientists sought historical and contemporary data on the aggregate intelligence budget under the Freedom of Information Act. After some litigation, the government released the figure for fiscal year 1997 and then, voluntarily, for 1998. It has refused, however, to release data for subsequent years and claims that releasing the figures for the years 1947-1970 could compromise "the interest of national defense or foreign policy" and "intelligence sources and methods." There have been times when the disclosure of irrationally or unjustifiably classified information has served the public. Certainly, in a system that depends on an informed and skeptical electorate, the government should not be moving in the direction of criminalizing public debate.

I got a notice today from MOXON & KOBRIN Attorneys at Law representing the Church of Scientology International ("CSI") and Religious Technology Center ("RTC") stating infringement Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act for a web site I currently mirror at  It appears that some of the infringements may be true ( I will have to look to be sure) but what really gets me is the part quoted below.. They are saying since "Scientology", "Dianetics", "Hubbard" and "NOTs" are registered trademarks they cannot be used in metatags in a webpage... The restriction in use of words in a web page is just flat out censorship.. Absolutely ridiculous... It would be one thing if someone used the words to represent a business.. But I would think metatags at the very least would fall under the "Fair Use" clause.  Quoted from email Lastly, you have placed the following federally registered trademarks belonging to RTC as metatags on your web page:
"Scientology" which is registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office under registration numbers: 1540928, 1342353,1329474, 1318717, 1036997, 0898018, 1755441;

I still do not understand how we can support Israel as we do..  From what I
have seen they are as much to blame for their problems as anyone else (maybe
more)...  When I was a much younger man I sided with Israel (American public
schooling, what can I say..)... Now that I am 37, I am tending towards the
Palestinian cause.  I don't approve of the radical groups attacking
civilians but I wouldn't at all disapprove of them attacking the Israeli
government agencies.  What would you do if a foreign government occupied
your country?   Of course allot of the problems would not turn out to be so
violent if countries would stop letting religions run their governments.
Hell, a dictatorship would have works things out by now.....

The main point I saw in the dissent and which I totally agree on, is the
police should not have the same standards as regular citizens when
performing their public duties since they alone have the power to force
citizens to do their will..  They work for the people and therefore should
be accountable for the people just like any boss should be able to monitor
their employees....  If you can't record their activities then how do you
police the police?  I am a firefighter and I would have no problem with
being recorded while doing my sworn duty...  When I am off work though that
is a different matter...
I will give you an example of how the police in my town were not able to
police themselves. However this does not have anything to do with recording
I really don't remember how it was found out but 7 off duty police officers
(I believe we only have about 15 or 20 in our town of 30,000 people) had
stolen property from a residence which was quoted in the newspaper as "an
abandoned building" in another county.. When the police chief was going to
fire them all the City Council said no they would not allow it. It was later
reported in the paper that the council was pressured by some of the
remaining officers. In the end the property was returned and no charges were
filed and all the officers returned to work after about 4 weeks off-duty
with no pay.  Then they petitioned afterwards and won to get their lost pay
back...  The only honest person in the whole situation was the Police Chief
and he was not able to do anything.... How can you trust someone to enforce
the laws they are breaking?

There are two types of windows on most American cars...  The first is the

windshield since it is easily removed with a sharp knife around the seal

windows are another matter, they are made to shatter so that there are no

This reminds me of complaints filed in the Air Force. If anyone files a
complaint either by the one that was wronged or somone who saw a person
being wronged the gears are then in motion...  These complaints can range
from sexual harrassment to sexual or racial discrimination, etc..
Essentially anything that is not of a criminal act. All criminal; acts are
handled by the security police and AFOSI (Air Force Office of Special
Investiagtions). Even if the complaintee wants to withdraw the complaint its
too late and the investigation must go forward. The basis for this is 1) To
stop people from using it as a threatening tool to get what they want since
most likely the investigation will show the truth if they made a false
statement  2) To ensure the complaintee hasn't been pressured to drop the
complaint by their superiors or peers. The investigation is always performed
by someone who does not have ties to the squadron of the people he is
investigating. This is done to try to take out any partiallity.. Criminal
acts are investigated the same way except the investigator is a law
enforcement official.
I like the idea of continuing the investigation no matter what.. While I
think the DMCA sucks I think that the only way the feds can stay
professional and look impartial in this incident is to continue to
investigate, otherwise it comes down to pick and choose what they will
enforce and when..

Randomly checking for a drivers license which you are required to have when driving. Many people who have had their drivers license suspended often drive their vehicles anyway. I would assume most states (if not all) require you to surrender you drivers license to the police when asked. I believe the law actually views the drivers license as the property of the state which would be where they have the right to revoke it.

to stand up and say its wrong is what has been taught in the military over

looking at a very long time of making big rock into little rocks.....  At
the same time would we risk torturing prisoners when we have preached for
