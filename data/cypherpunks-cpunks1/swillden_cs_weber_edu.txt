And Christian theology also offers an explanation as to why God would do
such a thing: so that faith is required for belief.
Logic is of no use in theological discussions.  Not because people are
incapable of understanding or applying it, but because they have already
applied it.  Given its own definitions and axioms, every belief system
I've encountered is pretty rational, and I've dealt with more than a
few.  As a Mormon missionary I spent quite a bit of time discussing
theology with people :-)
