"0.000002", "2.0.3.0.14.657" etc. but release numbering systems are
essentially arbitrary in nature so don't get excited as Lucrative goes
toward version 50+.
This release is a fairly minor one, but included some changes such as
the client name that I wanted to get out as soon as possible.

I went through an install with someone over IRC last night and made a
blog entry summarizing the install notes. I recommend reading the notes
before attempting an install. I am glad to help with an install, drop me
a note at patrick at lfcgate.com if you have trouble.
Some documentation on the various entities in the Lucrative system is
now available on the website,

you can:

Lucrative release 4 is out.
I know many people are used to seeing releases numbered like "0.000001",
"0.000002", "2.0.3.0.14.657" etc. but release numbering systems are
essentially arbitrary in nature so don't get excited as Lucrative goes
toward version 50+.
This release is a fairly minor one, but included some changes such as
the client name that I wanted to get out as soon as possible.
There is also a new development weblog at
I went through an install with someone over IRC last night and made a
blog entry summarizing the install notes. I recommend reading the notes
before attempting an install. I am glad to help with an install, drop me
a note at patrick at lfcgate.com if you have trouble.
Some documentation on the various entities in the Lucrative system is
now available on the website,
 but more is needed and
If Lucrative is interesting to you, please consider helping in any way
you can:
Installation reports
Feature requests
Source code patches
Are all very much welcomed. And criticism is more useful to me than
praise. My sincere thanks to everyone who has participated so far by installing,
testing, providing feedback, spreading the word, and donating.
And finally I just received word from SourceForge that the project
registration for Lucrative has been approved.

"0.000002", "2.0.3.0.14.657" etc. but release numbering systems are
essentially arbitrary in nature so don't get excited as Lucrative goes
toward version 50+.
This release is a fairly minor one, but included some changes such as

I went through an install with someone over IRC last night and made a
blog entry summarizing the install notes. I recommend reading the notes
before attempting an install. I am glad to help with an install, drop me
a note at patrick at lfcgate.com if you have trouble.

now available on the website,
