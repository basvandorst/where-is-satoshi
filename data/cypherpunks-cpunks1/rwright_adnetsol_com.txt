The way I see it:  if you narrow your targeting, by research, you can send SPAM to people who may really have a need for your products and services.  I send spam.  I am very apologetic, but I send only to software manufacturers.  I sell software media and duplication, so most software makers can relate to a request for me to quote on their needs.  BUT I OBJECT to spamming of usenet, and my mailing lists that I read.

Yes, Dr., this latest tripe that has spewed forth from Tim's keyboard reeks of bigotry.  And all this time I felt you may have been too hard on him.  This latest rant of his has made me reconsider your rough treatment of Mr. May.  I kinda think he deserves a slapping right now.
I find Mr. Mays comments quite racist and are quite off topic for this list.
I would much rather talk about what rights I have to do bulk, targeted e-mailings!  Or the fame of "The Spam King"  I saw him on a TV show called The Web on the SciFi channel.  This guy is a great example of the old adage that there is no such thing as bad publicity.
Just my two cents.  It's been too long since I last posted, but I was compelled to post about this racist crap.  I went to an inner-city school in South Gate, California and found it better to be friendly with anyone who would be my friend, despite the color of their skin.  I went into the US Military and that idea was reinforced there.  So I hate to hear people who are unwilling to find humanity behind a darker color skin.  That just pisses me off!

Yes, part of that "higher standard" is to keep your fucking mouth shut about that piece in your sholder holster.  Those that brag that they are packing and won't hesitate to use it are usually those that freeze under fire or snap at the workplace.
A true shooter shut's the fuck up and if needs be, let's the weapon do the talking when the time is right.
That mutually assured destruction shit only works for governments.  In this day and age you better think EVERYONE'S packing, and if you shoot your mouth off about your little pea shooter you just make yourself a target for the first shot fired.

It is just an effort for educators to better understand how their students may communicate.  So everyone who liked Tim May's

probably try remailing through other jurisdictions to evade
regulation. END QUOTE.

I always use my true name and am happy to spread it far and wide, but I have been doing some work for a GroupWare manufacturer.  They have seen that even in a corporate environment where information sharing is practised and embraced, sometimes people want to make a comment and not take the heat for making that comment.  This can provide some constructive input, so they have a anonymous comment feature built in.  So you could say that it is absolutely necessary for the web to have that feature as well.
NO WAY, These guys are in my life enough already, and you can't trust them anyway!!!!

It's affecting the rights of these fine spammers, Cyber Promotions.  That affects spammers everywhere.  More rules by our government affects all of us.
That's the real point I have always made.  No rules and we should
not want rules.  Why are we INVITING the government into OUR
internet??? Just cause we have to read spam?  That is just plain
stupid!!!  Just cause we have to read spam, oh well, let the
government come on in. Do we let the government into our bedrooms
because our wife says no to sex tonight or because we don't like to
make our beds??  Everyone on this list seems to want to limit
government  intervention EXCEPT when it comes to spam, then every
one just holds the door open wide and let them in.  If they get that
inch, they WILL take the whole 9 YARDS!!!!!!  Get a clue, delete or
killfile those who spam and keep the government out of
By the way, I get about 2 or 3 spams a day in my mailbox and it is not killing me!  Don't get the wrong idea, I don't like it.  I like the government WAY LESS!!!!! Ross Wright

Sure. I agree with that, no shoes no shirt, if you are on AOL you accept "internet-lite".
Right now.  Yet it has been apparent to me that many people are begging for restrictions to be put in place.  Restrictions on spammers.  The government saying anything about regulation of the internet is bad...  Yet people still scream about a couple of unwanted e-mails.  I'm saying that this spammer thing could be the "kink in our armour" that lets the government into our little playground here.  Just suck it up and delete those messages.

I must agree that having a website invites unsolicited  e-mail, if only to comment that people have seen the site.  I send unsolicited e-mail to website owners as part of my marketing plan.
That's what makes it smell fishy.  When I send  unsolicited  e-mail I give up the whole deal: phone number and all.  If someone complains, I make great effort to never contact that person again.  Either you want people to know who you are or you don't. As I said having a website invites comments.  It's like being a public figure.  In effect you are publishing your e-mail address.
Just like all the seedy low life multi-level-marketing jerks!  No need to use a remailer for that.
Just 2 cents worth.

Just great.  That sure takes away any anonymity you had about being "on the cutting edge" of the information age.  That 1952 "proof-read" crap went out in the 70's.  How can you hope to enforce it?  It's a joke, right? :)  Maybe not, since it's on your sig-line.
Sorry, Wombat.  As much as I hate to agree with this multi level long distance phone company spammer.  He is right.  A website is an open invitation to comment and e-mail.  Better password your site if you want to solve this problem.  Then no-one can visit it, and no-one can send out a spider to get your e-mail address.  That's what I do, send out a robot to bring back e-mail addresses.  Of course I only send to makers of software, and my product applys to their world.
If you don't want spam in your mail box:
1. Don't have a website or don't put your e-mail address on your     website
2. Don't post to newsgroups
3. Don't post to mailing lists
4. If you post do so anonymously

Right, but this is where a tool comes in that lets you post a

harder for an article to be canceled, I imagine.  Or you can do it by hand.  I am sure that in a 40 hour week I could post seemingly "On-Topic" to many newsgroups.  Hell, I'm doing this on a minor scale right now.
Bob just needs to be *really* smart.  And if he has a good relaitionship with his small, local ISP, then he can proceed as normal.  Hell, I never get complaints anymore.
Yet, every time I post I advertise my company.
Boy, I would be pissed off if I was Bob.  This is definitely the scary end of the internet.  Most people will never even know about this rash of first amendment violations, that you are calling "forged cancels" and "plug pulling".
I am so glad I fell into these groups when I joined the net just about 20 months ago.  Funny thing is, it's right where I belong.  I always speak my mind and have been known as a trouble maker in the Well, it seems to me that this is where this conversation is leading.

Tuesday August 26 9:39 AM EDT U.S. Judge Rules Encryption Regulations Invalid
SAN FRANCISCO - U.S. government regulations on the export of
encryption software are unconstitutional, a federal judge ruled. U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel said licensing requirements for
the export of encryption software and related devices were an
unconstitutional prior restraint on First Amendment free speech
rights. Patel also issued a permanent injunction barring the government from
enforcing the regulations against plaintiff Daniel Bernstein or anyone
who sought to use, discuss or publish his encryption program. Encryption involves running a readable message though a computer
program that translates the message according to an equation or
algorithm into unreadable "ciphertext." "By the very terms of the encryption regulations, the most common
expressive activities of scholars -- teaching a class, publishing
their ideas, speaking at conferences, or writing to colleagues over
the Internet -- are subject to a prior restraint by the export
controls ...," Patel wrote in a 32-page ruling released in San
Francisco. Patel said that, having found the regulations to be invalid, she could
have issued a nationwide injunction barring their enforcement. But she
said she had kept the injunction as narrow as possible pending appeal
because "the legal questions at issue are novel, complex and of public
importance." The ruling is important because the computer industry sees use of
encryption technology across country borders as essential for
advancing electronic commerce and private communications over the
Internet. The government has previously cited national security concerns over
the export of encryption programs. As a graduate student, Bernstein developed an encryption algorithm he
called "Snuffle." In 1992, Bernstein asked the State Department
whether Snuffle was controlled by export regulations then in force
which classified cryptographic software as "defense articles." The government told him his program was subject to licensing by the
Department of State prior to export. Alleging that he was not free to teach, publish or discuss with other
scientists his theories on cryptography embodied in the Snuffle
program, Berstein sued the State Department in 1995, challenging the
regulations on free speech grounds. Bernstein is now a research assistant professor of mathematics, statistics and computer science at the University of Illinois
at Chicago. Patel ruled last December that the old regulations limiting the export
of encryption software violated the First Amendment.
But late last year, President Bill Clinton issued an executive order
transferring jurisdiction over the export of nonmilitary encryption
products to the Commerce Department. Patel's latest ruling was on Bernstein's amended lawsuit which
included the new regulations and new defendants. Patel said that her finding that encryption source code was speech
protected by the First Amendment did not remove encryption technology
from all government regulation. Cindy Cohn, a lawyer for Bernstein, called the ruling a "very big
victory" for free speech advocates. "This brings us a step closer to
people being able to freely publish ideas about encryption," she said.
A U.S. Justice Department lawyer who defended the regulations could
not immediately be reached for comment. The government could appeal
the ruling. Copyright, Reuters Ltd. All rights reserved Ross Wright

TBTF for 5/4/95 [6]
In 1995 the FBI asked for and was granted $500 million to augment the
government's ability to tap communications (of this total $100M has
been released to the FBI so far). Privacy advocates expressed outrage
at the FBI's stated capacity goal: to be able to listen in on 1% of
installed telephone lines at any time. This translates to about 1.6
million taps simultaneous of all kinds: pen registers, trap-and-trace,
and wiretaps. The FBI withdrew its initial proposal under fire and on
1/14 submitted a revised proposal -- press release at [7], analysis
at [8]. Unlike the earlier draft, this essay lays out its assumptions
and straightforwardly projects needed capacity growth. The result is
a capacity figure of fewer than 60,000 intercepts, less that 4% of
the original request. This level of capability would allow the FBI
simultaneously to monitor more than 500 phone lines in an area with
the population of Manhatta still an enormous increase on historical numbers of intercepts.

Dear Friends,
On February 8, the first anniversary of the Telecommunications Reform
Act of 1996, NetAction and the Center for Educational Priorities are
launching a month-long Internet demonstration to call attention to the
wide gap between the rhetoric and reality of this sweeping
legislation.  President Clinton and Congress promised the American people that
enactment of the Telecommunications Reform Act would lead to a
cornucopia of technological innovations that would change the nation's
cultural frontiers, expand our choices, dazzle our eyes, and inform
our minds.  Instead, we've been censored in cyberspace, subjected to
TV ratings systems, and prevented from experiencing the benefits of a
truly competitive marketplace by the emergence of "cartels" created by
mega-mergers in the telecommunications and media industries.
This is not reform!  And it's not too late to demand that our decision
makers deliver on what they promised us on February 8, 1996: MORE
competition, MORE consumer choices, MORE widespread access to
information technology.
The Center for Educational Priorities and NetAction are spearheading
this demonstration in an effort to pressure the Federal Communications
Commission and other state and national regulatory agencies to ensure
that the Act is implemented in a way that truly benefits the public. We invite you to join this effort by linking to the site at
 for one month beginning on February
8.  By linking to the protest site, you will be adding your voice to a
united demand for true telecommunications reform.
The site is currently under development.  When completed, it will
feature brief summaries of the impact the Act has had in its first
year on telecommunications and technology policy, media ownership and
content, and censorship, along with suggested actions to help ensure
that implementation of the Act truly benefits the public.  We are also
creating extensive links to other organizations working on these
issues, as well as to other sites with current information on
censorship, mega-mergers, universal service, school hook-ups, and the
v-chip. We welcome suggestions for additional links to add.
Please let us know if you will participate in the demonstration by
contacting NetAction, by email at akrause at igc.org, or by phone at
415-775-8674. Thanks!

launching a month-long Internet demonstration to call attention to the
wide gap between the rhetoric and reality of this sweeping
legislation.  President Clinton and Congress promised the American people that
enactment of the Telecommunications Reform Act would lead to a
cornucopia of technological innovations that would change the nation's
cultural frontiers, expand our choices, dazzle our eyes, and inform
our minds.  Instead, we've been censored in cyberspace, subjected to
TV ratings systems, and prevented from experiencing the benefits of a
truly competitive marketplace by the emergence of "cartels" created by
mega-mergers in the telecommunications and media industries.
This is not reform!  And it's not too late to demand that our decision
makers deliver on what they promised us on February 8, 1996: MORE
competition, MORE consumer choices, MORE widespread access to
information technology.
The Center for Educational Priorities and NetAction are spearheading
this demonstration in an effort to pressure the Federal Communications
Commission and other state and national regulatory agencies to ensure
that the Act is implemented in a way that truly benefits the public. We invite you to join this effort by linking to the site at
 for one month beginning on February
8.  By linking to the protest site, you will be adding your voice to a
united demand for true telecommunications reform.
The site is currently under development.  When completed, it will
feature brief summaries of the impact the Act has had in its first
year on telecommunications and technology policy, media ownership and
content, and censorship, along with suggested actions to help ensure
that implementation of the Act truly benefits the public.  We are also
creating extensive links to other organizations working on these
issues, as well as to other sites with current information on
censorship, mega-mergers, universal service, school hook-ups, and the
v-chip. We welcome suggestions for additional links to add.
Please let us know if you will participate in the demonstration by
contacting NetAction, by email at akrause at igc.org, or by phone at
415-775-8674. Thanks!

And here's where it degrades into discussions about ads and sales tactics and all that stuff that the general public is so frightened of.  It's like salesmen are the reviled, untouchables in our society. Needed but hated.  These topics always fall to the level of the morals of given marketing strategies.

God, Last summer we had the whole "Spam as Free Speech Debate".  Now Rick Osborne drags it up again.  You can not retaliate against free speech, Rick.  That's a bad thing, plain and simple, black and white. Some of your metaphors are kinda harsh, and a bit cartoonish.
Well, you are doing OK so far.
It depends on what street you are walking, here.  Kevelar *may* be in order.  What's your problem with your 'delete' key?  Broken?
Now, here's where you start to go really crazy.  Spam as a weapon?  Please, Rick get ahold of yourself.  It's just e-mail.  Nothing scary or harmful, right?  Right?
You got a website?  You post to usenet?  I know you post to this list.  By now, everyone knows that any of those things are as good as giving away your e-mail address.  Maybe that's unethical, but it's a fact.  And if you do have a website, it's an open invitation for me to send you advertisements, just like the yellow pages.
Free speech is a right.  You have the right to make some snotty reply, but no right to intentionally harm.  You are doing wrong if you try to harm someone who is exercising their right to free speech.  Rick, what if someone decided they did not like an opinion you expressed on this list and did the same thing to you?  See, it's all the same thing.  You, nor anyone else, has a right to lash out at someone for something they say or some ad they send you.
Because FREE SPEECH IS A RIGHT WE HAVE!  Why all this talk of retribution?
No one has a right to retaliate, get it?  First Amendment?  I didn't read in there the right to get back at some poor advertisers, did Free Speech : Good      Mail Bombs : Bad
Ahhh, at last the point.  Are you a self centred ass, who's personal feelings are more important that the Constitution?  Feel better?  How about when those black suited ninjas break into your house to steal your rights?  That's my metaphor of what you are doing to people who spam you...
It's talk like this that those good old boys in D.C. love.  Bad internet, bad.
Um, there is no war against spammers.  Did you know that?  You could be doing so much more with your time.  Please reconsider.  Thank you.
No war, no battles, no skirmishes, no need for "Anti-Spam Laws".  Just be nice, and everything will work out for the best.  I'm more worried about this anti bomb making recipe law that the government is yammering about now. Ross Wright

You can spam him back, but with just as many megs as he sends you.  Match him meg for meg, not 10,000 megs for 1 meg.
I have a unique way of dealing with spammers.  I set up a list of the e-mail addresses of the spammers.  Each time a new spammer spams me, I send him a copy of the addresses, telling him "I am not interested in your product or service, but my associates will be. Here's their addresses."  Then I add him to the list, and so on.  This way the spammers are spamming each other.  Poetic Justice.  And no harm done.
Well, if you publish it on a website it *is* free game.
No perfect world here.  Hell the deep dark secret that everyone glosses over is the fact that advertisers are using years of behavioral analysis to better market to us.  That's the real I agree that the gathering of e-mail address from usenet and from mailing lists is a bad thing.  *But*  if you have a web page, you have a yellowpages ad.
Right, but you see what I am saying about a web page being a yellow pages ad, right?
Please, a few megs between cyber-clients?  No harm no foul.  You get more megs of crap just from this list!  I'd bet real money on that!
Set up a robot to send you megs and megs of crap, just for one e-mail, that's what I am saying.  You wouldn't like that very much!
You do.  One for one.  Mano a mano.  No more, no less.
 > >No one has a right to retaliate, get it?  First Amendment?  I
But, you see, they send the pamphlets to a few billion addresses, not just to your house.  Apples and oranges.
Spam is not equal to an arp attack or a mail bomb.  One letter to one address is quite different than 10,000 letters to one address.
Me too, by the way.  An opinionated one, as well.
No you are advocating harming others who are speeking freely.
Again, I say:  One Meg Per One Meg.  Equal and fair.
Well, I just hope that this dosen't get carried away, that's all.  Match them meg for meg that you personally receive, and everything really will be OK.  And if we keep the government out of it.
It's just an act.  I am pretty jaded.

No shit, you just can't send 10,000 megs of info in retaliation for a few bits.  Really, there's no call for that.  It's wrong. What?  Like 80 cents per gig?  Please a bit here and a byte there isn't going to break anyone.  Could someone do the math?
One message in your in box is no excuse for terror tactics.  Mail bombs, arp atacks, calls for regulations: aren't you over reacting?  Just a little?  I think your mental well being is in question anyway.

Such a watse of talented code writing.  And why are you escalating this?
Well I've tried to describe that you lose about a dime per year.
You can feel free to send me twice as many bytes as I send to you, OK?  Feel beter?  No!  You must fuck me over because I sent you my latest MLM scam.  Yeah that's so mature!  Come out from behind your remailer and state your opinions, wrong as they are.

Tasty Bits From The Technology Front
 Your Host:  Keith Dawson
    This issue: ..Mailing-list spammers..
    Email spam is the favorite gripe of most Netizens, excepting the
    spammers. Congress is considering legislation [25] to limit the
    practice of sending unwanted commercial email in bulk. Not everyone
    thinks this is a good idea. See [26] for a thread from an ongoing
    debate on Declan McCullagh's fight-censorship mailing list. George
    Matyjewicz  did a modest experiment on a
    week's worth of his email -- he is on 56 mailing lists and gets
    around 200 messages a day -- to gauge how widespread the problem
    actually is. Matyjewicz posted these results:
                        week     avg/day
      Total messages    1,354    193.4
      Spam messages        10      1.4     < 1 %
      Spam complaints     189     27.0      14 %
    Mailing-list owners share information on the addresses from which
    commercial spam messages originate. Recently Alexander Verbraeck
     posted a particularly compre-
    hensive list of purported spammers. I have taken the liberty of
    preserving a snapshot on the TBTF archive [27], sorted both by email
    address and by "virulence" -- the total number of messages sent by
    each spammer over a given time period to two of Verbraeck's lists.

ANOTHER VICTORY FOR FREE RADIO BERKELEY & MICROPOWER BROADCASTING
At 7 PM on Thursday, [ed: correction - Wednesday] November 12
attorneys for Stephen Dunifer & Free Radio Berkeley received a 14 page
decision via fax from Federal District Court Judge Claudia Wilken
announcing her ruling in favor of Stephen Dunifer and Free Radio
Berkeley. Her ruling denies the FCC's motion for summary judgement for
a permanent injunction, states that she has jurisdiction in this case
and that the FCC's regulatory structure is unconstitutional. Further,
she orders the FCC to submit within 14 days a brief on the
constitutional issues raised. Essentially Judge Claudia Wilken affirms
all the merits and arguments raised by the defense attorneys for
Stephen Dunifer and Free Radio Berkeley. Stay tuned for further
details. The full text of the decision will be posted ASAP. A victory
party will take place on Saturday evening, November 15 in Berkeley.
Place to be announced as soon as one is secured. Everyone is invited.

Blah blah blah.  I'm bored with this SHIT.  Blah blah blah.  Like the TruthMonger said, you roll around on the floor with the
dogs, you gonna get licked on the mouth.  Spam is a fact of life, and complaining about it is far worse than
spam.  Again, I say:  hit your delete key and shut up, you fucktard.

No, actually your complaints about spam are TRUE theft of services.  In an article that I posted to this list last year it says the following:
Mailing-list spammers
Email spam is the favorite gripe of most Netizens, excepting the
spammers. Congress is considering legislation [25] to limit the
practice of sending unwanted commercial email in bulk. Not everyone
thinks this is a good idea. See [26] for a thread from an ongoing
debate on Declan McCullagh's fight-censorship mailing list. George
Matyjewicz  did a modest experiment
on a week's worth of his email -- he is on 56 mailing lists and gets
around 200 messages a day -- to gauge how widespread the problem
actually is. Matyjewicz posted these results: Total messages...1,354...193.4
Spam messages.......10.......1.4.....< 1 %
Spam complaints....189.......27.0.....14 %
This article is at:
Spam is not crime, it's commerce.  Shut up and hit that delete key, you fucktard.

Is that *really* what you want?
Again, I ask: "Is that *REALLY* what you want?"  You want stupid congressmen and women to make new laws about spam???  Are you nuts?
*Really*, you want them sticking their small minds into the internet? You and all your "organized ISP" brothers should just shut up and hit the delete keys, you bunch of fucktards.

Dear Supporters of Community Media and Free Speech,
You may be aware that the Federal Communications Commission
has recently intensified it's assault on unlicensed micropower
radio stations.  In response to this campaign and the government's
longstanding ban on low-power radio, a national movement has emerged
to proliferate microbroadcasting, and win constitutional protection to
broadcast at the community level.
We invite you to  show your support for
community access to the airwaves. Join us in Washington, DC
on Sunday, October 4  for a micropower radio conference,
and on Monday October 5 for a march on FCC and  NAB headquarters.
Workshops & information will be offered on how to start a radio
station and acquire the necessary equipment.
Please pass this on to people who might be interested, especially
those who don't have access to the internet.
See you in Washington.

its heart." --Noam Chomsky
SHOWDOWN AT THE FCC!
 FREE RADIO ACTIVISTS MARCH ON WASHINGTON TO
 CONFRONT THE GLOBAL  MEDIA MONOPOLY AND
THEIR MARIONETTES IN GOVERNMENT!
Sunday, October 4, 1998
Monday, October 5, 1998
Washington, DC
Calling all media activists, microbroadcasters and people for a
democratic media:
 Come to DC for the first national mobilization for free radio.
 Microbroadcasters from around the country will gather for
 two days to share radio skills, organize alliances, speak out
 to the media and protest at the FCC and NAB buildings,
 culminating in a live broadcast straight into the offices of the
people working so hard to shut us down. Free Radio Berkeley, Radio
Mutiny, Steal This Radio and other microstations have all broadcast
live in public and challenged the FCC to shut them down in the light
of day, in front of the press and the Feds have never dared to show
their face- this time, we're going to take it right to their doorstep
and tell them that if they're so sure that their dumb law is worth
enforcing, then the Chairman should come down from the 8th floor and
put the cuffs on us himself.
There will also be workshops to help new folks start
stations, appointments will be made to lobby congress
people, and press events will be held to show the true,
diverse face of the microbroadcasting movement.
                       Sunday,
                       10-12 workshops (to be announced)
                       12-1 lunch
                       1-3 workshops (to be announced)
                       3-5 speakout
                       5-6:30 dinner
                       7pm party/puppet making for demonstration
  Monday
 10:30 am MARCH AND PUPPET PARADE
  starts at Dupont Circle, goes to the Federal
 Communications Commission building, and then marches
on to confront the National Association of Broadcasters.
During these protests, we will flip the giant free speech
switches, turn on our transmitters and strike a blow against
the meta-marionettes: A giant puppet of General Electric
and Corporate America, which will in turn control a slightly
smaller puppet of the National Association of Broadcasters,
which in turn will operate a smaller puppet of the FCC,
which in turn will be trying to stamp out microbroadcasters
and our free speech rights. These demonstrations will also
include a number of sneaky surprises that are so cool that
we can't even mention them here!
meetings set up with people's congressional
representatives for lobbying
4pm press event:
What Can a Black Panther, a Free Market Think Tank
Policy Analyst, an Anarchist Feminist,   A Radio Engineer,
A Public Health Worker and a Discount
Store Owner Agree Upon? IT'S TIME TO LEGALIZE
 So what's YOUR excuse not to come to the most
excellent weekend of mayhem ever? Nothing. Then good-
we'll see you there.
Bring a sleeping bag, cameras and recording devices,
vehicles, some money to help this all come off, questions
for the experts on pirate station operations, puppet
materials, signs and banners, transmitters, AND ALL OF
YOUR FRIENDS!
