Thursday August 2 6:57 AM ET
                Website Says Virus Leaked Ukrainian Secret
                Documents
                KIEV, Ukraine (Reuters) - A Ukrainian Web site said on
Thursday it had
                received secret documents from the administration of
President Leonid
                Kuchma due to a computer virus that infected government
computers and
                e-mailed it the files.
                ``The Sircam virus, having infected the computers in the
                administration, is bombarding our editorial department
with their
                documents,'' said the ForUm news Web site
                Administration officials declined to say whether their
security had been
                breached, but told Reuters they had started an
investigation into whether
                any of their computers were infected with viruses.
                ForUm printed one of the documents it said it had
received -- a timetable
                for Kuchma's movements on Ukraine's 10th anniversary of
                later this month. Kuchma's exact movements are usually a
tightly guarded
                secret.
                The Sircam virus, which first emerged in July, is a
so-called e-mail worm
                which arrives as an e-mail attachment and sends copies
of itself to names
                and addresses in the infected computer's address book.
Tim, you don't write Ukrainian, do you?

M.I.T. Physicist Says Pentagon Is
                             Trying to Silence Him
                             by James Dao
                             WASHINGTON - A leading critic of the
military's missile defense testing
                             program has accused the Pentagon of trying
to silence him and
                             intimidate his employer, the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, by
                             investigating him for disseminating
classified documents.
                             The case has raised questions about whether
a document can be
                             considered secret if it is widely available
to the public. And it has
                             touched off a dispute between the critic,
Theodore A. Postol, and M.I.T.
                             over how to balance academic freedom with
the university's obligations
                             to cooperate with Pentagon investigators.
                             At issue is correspondence between Dr.
Postol, a
                             physicist, and the General Accounting
Office, an
                             investigative branch of Congress, in which
                             accused the Pentagon of using doctored data
                             defend missile defense technology.
                             Dr. Postol said his conclusions had been
based on
                             an unclassified report, which he
disseminated over
                             the Internet and can now be downloaded from
                             sites around the world, including one in
                             But after Dr. Postol began distributing the
                             last year, the Pentagon determined that it
                             secret information. This month, Defense
                             Department investigators asked M.I.T.
officials to
                             stop Dr. Postol from disseminating that
                             and to confiscate the document from him.
                             The university has not done so. But in an
e-mail message to Dr. Postol
                             on Monday, Charles M. Vest, the university
president, said M.I.T. might
                             be required to ``move forward with at least
the initial steps'' ordered by
                             Defense Security Service, a Pentagon
agency. Dr. Postol provided a
                             copy of that message to The New York Times.
                             ``They are basically threatening M.I.T.
that it will lose its contract to run
                             this big laboratory if they don't abide by
these demands,'' Dr. Postol said
                             in an interview.
                             The institute operates the Lincoln
Laboratory at Hanscom Air Force Base
                             in Lexington, Mass., under contract with
the Defense Department to do
                             research into missile defense, weather
forecasting, military surveillance
                             and other sophisticated technologies. The
lab's contract with the
                             Pentagon was worth $319 million last year.
                             M.I.T. officials declined to speculate
today on whether Dr. Vest would
                             cooperate with the Pentagon's requests. But
Dr. Vest issued a written
                             statement that raised questions about the
investigation of Dr. Postol.
                             ``While M.I.T. certainly abides by the laws
that protect national security,
                             we also believe that the legitimate tools
of classification of secrets should
                             not be misused to limit responsible
debate,'' the statement said. ``Trying
                             to treat widely available public
information as `secret' is a particular
                             concern.''
                             Pentagon officials declined to discuss
details of their investigation. But
                             Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, a spokesman for the
Ballistic Missile Defense
                             Organization, argued that the department
was obligated to stop Dr. Postol
                             from disseminating potentially damaging
information, even if it was
                             readily available.
                             ``Just because it is made public doesn't
mean it's declassified,'' Colonel
                             Lehner said.
                             Dr. Postol agreed that the information was
potentially damaging, but only
                             because it showed that the Pentagon was far
from developing effective
                             antimissile weapons.
                             For years, Dr. Postol has argued that the
Pentagon's prototype
                             antimissile system could not distinguish
between decoys and enemy
                             warheads. He has joined forces with an
engineer, Nira Schwartz, who
                             has accused her former employer, TRW, a
military contractor, of faking
                             tests and evaluations of the technology to
make it appear more
                             successful than it was.
                             The latest dispute arose when the Pentagon
hired five scientists,
                             including two from M.I.T.'s Lincoln
Laboratory, to review TRW's
                             technology in the wake of Dr. Schwartz's
accusations. The resulting
                             report disputed Dr. Schwartz's assertions
and has been used to defend
                             the missile defense program on Capitol
                             But Dr. Postol, who in the 1990's
successfully challenged the
                             effectiveness of Patriot missiles in the
Persian Gulf war, analyzed the
                             report and concluded it had distorted data
to make it appear that
                             available technology could reliably
distinguish warheads from decoys. In
                             fact, Dr. Postol contends, that technology
does not yet exist.
                             The Pentagon and TRW have denied that
                             Dr. Postol first raised concerns about the
Pentagon report in a letter to
                             the White House last year. Not long after,
the Pentagon determined that
                             officials had inadvertently not removed
classified information from the
                             report before releasing it, including the
tables and diagrams Dr. Postol
                             has used to attack the testing program.
                             But Dr. Postol, who has done work for the
Pentagon and stands to lose
                             his security clearance, contends that the
Pentagon's actions smack of a
                             cover-up. He has recruited supporters in
Congress. Representative
                             Henry A. Waxman of California, the ranking
Democrat on the House
                             Committee on Government Reform, has asked
the Pentagon to review
                             Dr. Postol's accusations about the report.
Representative Edward J.
                             Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, has asked
the General Accounting
                             Office to study the Defense Department's
classification policy.
                             ``The question that naturally arises is
whether such a policy really
                             protects national security or whether it
merely serves to stifle the ability
                             of Dr. Postol to communicate his views,''
Mr. Markey asks in a letter sent
                             to the accounting office today.

Out-of-state resident can be sued in DVD
        case
        By Jim Hu CNET News.com
        An out-of-state resident who allegedly posted computer code that
        circumvents DVD encryption measures can be sued under California
        a California appeals court ruled Tuesday.
                          The Sixth Appellate Court of California
decided that
                          Matthew Pavlovich, who is not a California
                          could be tried for violating the state's trade
                          law.
                          "The reach of the Internet is also the reach
of the
                          extension of the poster's presence," the
ruling stated.
                          The decision follows what appeared to have
been a
                          small victory for Pavlovich in December 2000,
                          the California Supreme Court ordered a lower
        to show he should remain in the case even though he is not a
        resident.
        Because of the ruling, others involved in the case living
outside California
        will remain under the state's jurisdiction. The ruling could
show that the
        Internet is not immune to California's long-arm statutes even
when the
        publisher of the site is located outside the state.
        The DVD Copy Control Association originally filed a complaint in
        December 1999 against Pavlovich for allegedly posting the DeCSS
        - web sites) code on his Web site. The suit was meant to prevent
        dissemination of DeCSS, a code whose original intent was to let
        programmers create a DVD player for Linux (news - web sites)
        The movie industry and DVD CCA argued that DeCSS could be used
        illegally copy DVDs and have taken legal action against people
posting the
        code on their sites. In a federal case filed in New York, for
example, the
        Motion Picture Association of America is suing 2600, a site that
        published and linked to the DeCSS code.
        Allon Levy, the attorney representing Pavlovich, could not be
reached for
        comment.
        "The very significance in it has held that persons like
Pavlovich in various
        parts of the country are subject to jurisdiction in a California
court if they
        did what Pavlovich did," said Robert Sugarman, an attorney at
        Gotshal & Manges and a legal counsel for the DVD CCA.

                        (NYSE:T - news) is blocking
                        access to Web servers that
                        residential customers are
                        running, a spokeswoman said
                        on Wednesday.
                        ``We are trying to protect our
        greater user population as a whole,'' said AT&T
        spokeswoman Sarah Eder. The company provides
        cable Internet access to 1.35 million residential
        customers, she said.
        By blocking incoming traffic to Web servers,
        AT&T is effectively shutting down the Web sites,
        which residential customers are not supposed to
        be operating anyway, Eder said.
        ``According to our official use policy, customers
        are not permitted to operate Web servers behind
        cable modems,'' she said.
        Commercial customers of AT&T's cable Internet
        service are not affected, she added.
        The Code Red worms spread through a hole in
        Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Information Server
        Web software running on Windows NT and 2000
        computers and then scan the Internet looking for
        new computers to infect.
        Code Red II, which surfaced on Saturday, leaves a
        ``back door'' on infected computers, making them
        vulnerable to future hacking.
        Code Red II also spreads more quickly, looking
        for computers in close proximity or the same
        network to infect rather than random computers
        on the Internet, like Code Red I does.
        This scanning of the local neighborhoods is
        slowing down cable modem networks, where
        subscribers share bandwidth.

Learned the following today: starting soon --Jan 2002 IIRC-- you can't
use an unswipable drivers license to buy a gun in CA.  When asked, the
 employee said there was encrypted info on them
that was harder to forge than the holograph-laminated front.
When I said that the licenses could be read with a regular cardreader
and that info could be forged, he suggested it was the newer license
(with two pictures vs 1 and an optical bar code too).  He suggested that
the "encrypted info" was harder to forge than the laminated front.
This would be possible if the front info was securely hashed with a
secret key.
Anyone have more info?  Good citizens are curious if they did this
right, and
what all the bits on the strip mean.
So monkeywrenching the magstrip will impair your constitutional rights.
A replacement license is $12; perhaps a good citizen needs a spare.
In any case Govn'or Slime Davis signed a law requiring fingerprints in a

I bet they'll be taking hair samples or cheek scrapings in five years.

              sport-utility lot had been set
              afire.
              The fire at Ray A. Schoppert
              Logging Inc., in Eagle Creek,
              Ore., also occurred between 2
              and 3 a.m. This one, on June 1,
              near the site of a disputed timber
              sale in a federal forest, burned
              three logging trucks.
              Sometime in the night of June
              10, someone broke into a
              research farm owned by Seminis Inc., near Twin Falls,
              and ripped out hundreds of genetically altered pea plants.
              These incidents share more than the fact that none has
              resulted in an arrest. All three appear to be part of what
              federal authorities describe as a growing pattern of
              eco-sabotage, or vandalism, that its anonymous
              claim to have carried out in defense of the environment.
              Many of these attacks, which the authorities say are
              especially prevalent here in the Pacific Northwest, are
              relatively small-scale and fail to attract much attention.
              go unreported, for the companies involved are often
              reluctant to generate publicity that might make them a
              all over again.
              But even if less noticed than major acts of eco-sabotage
              the recent fire at a University of Washington genetics
              research laboratory, the vandalism has quietly reshaped
              for many small businesses, forcing a need for safety
              measures that would have once been unthinkable.
              "We've had to beef up security so it looks like a prison
              around our greenhouses," said Crystal Fricker, president
              Pure-Seed Testing Company in Canby, Ore., which grows all
              kinds of grass seed. The company installed a chain-link
              with razor wire, motion sensors and an alarm system after
              vandals broke into greenhouses on its 110-acre property
              June.
              The intruders destroyed several research projects, stomped
              on the grass, spray-painted slogans like "Nature bites
              and left behind golf balls marked with the letter A, the
              international anarchists' symbol. Pure-Seed was apparently
              singled out because of its experiments with a genetically
              modified form of grass that could be used for putting
              on golf courses.
              A few days after the incident, an e- mail message from a
              sender identifying itself as the Anarchist Golfing
              claimed responsibility for the vandalism, which caused
              roughly $500,000 in damage.
              "Grass, like industrial culture, is invasive and permeates
              every aspect of our lives," the message said. "While the
              trade journals claim that `golf courses provide suitable
              habitat for wildlife,' we see them as a destroyer of all
              wild."

@_subject: Denver to use facial biometrics on drivers' licenses 
Colo. to 'map' faces of drivers
                   By Julia C. Martinez
                   Denver Post Capitol Bureau
                   Wednesday, July 04, 2001 - First it was the
photo-radar vans
                   snapping pictures of Denver-area speeders.
                   Now, some fear Big Brother's roving eye soon will be
watching all of
                   Colorado with the arrival of a new European import
called "face
                   recognition."
                   The Department of Motor Vehicles, in an effort to
prevent identity theft
                   and driver's license fraud, is buying cameras that
will map every
                   driver's facial characteristics like a
three-dimensional land chart.
                   The danger, critics say, is that the technology could
eventually be
                   expanded to monitor the comings and goings of
ordinary Coloradans.
                   This week, Tampa, Fla., became the first city in the
United States to
                   install similar high-tech security cameras on public
streets to scan
                   crowds in the city's nightlife district. Images will
be compared against
                   a database of mug shots of people with active
                   "There is a danger," said Rep. Matt Smith, a Grand
Junction lawmaker
                   and attorney who serves on a statewide task force
studying the issue
                   of privacy. "The intended purpose of facial
recognition is to help the
                   state prevent the theft of identity. Now the question
is, "What will its
                   future use be?'
                   "There has to be a point where the government doesn't
have its nose
                   over every shoulder," he said.
                   Mug shots compared
                   Old driver's license photos will be scanned into a
computer database
                   using the new technology. Then, starting next July,
new mugs will be
                   compared with those on file to make sure people are
who they say
                   they are when they go to get, or renew, a Colorado
driver's license.
                   It doesn't matter if you gain 200 pounds and go bald
                   photographs. Short of plastic surgery, the camera
will recognize you.
                   "Facial recognition deals with spatial details, where
a nose is compared
                   with the eyes," said Dorothy Dalquist, spokeswoman
for the Colorado
                   Department of Revenue. "Baldness doesn't count, and
weight doesn't
                   either. It's the basic facial structure."
                   The state legislature authorized the technology
during the last session.
                   State officials won't disclose the cost of the system
until they meet
                   later this month with officials from Polaroid, one of
the companies
                   involved in making the system.
                   In the beginning, face recognition will be used to
try to prevent
                   criminals from obtaining multiple driver licenses
under others' names,
                   Dalquist said.
                   "We know of cases where individuals steal personal
information from
                   other people, forge documents and go to six or seven
driver license
                   offices getting licenses with their pictures and
other people's
                   identities. In theory, they have a legitimate
license, but in actuality,
                   they're not who they say they are," Dalquist said.
"Now, we will be
                   able to say after the first one, "No, you can't have
another one.'"
                   Or the police could be called in.
                   "My guess is if we saw something that is an egregious
misuse of the
                   system, we might alert law enforcement to that," she
                   The cameras can't prevent the types of fraud that now
occur when
                   people make their own driver's licenses using home
computers and
                   the Internet. However, as part of the new program,
invisible markers
                   will be added to each new license so stores or banks
can scan the card
                   to see if it's genuine.
                   Privacy concerns
                   The technology has raised concerns about privacy,
ethics and
                   government intrusion. Privacy advocates are concerned
that a
                   database of photographs could itself spill into the
Orwellian realm.
                   "We all want to catch as many criminals as we
possibly can, but we
                   also have to be concerned about the privacy issues,"
said Sen. Ken
                   Gordon, D-Denver, a member of a state task force set
up to craft
                   legislation aimed at protecting privacy. "Information
obtained for one
                   purpose is sometimes used for reasons that were not
contemplated by
                   people who set up the system to begin with."
                   Gordon said Colorado already sells driver records to
                   companies for $5 million a year.
                   "If we're going to create a database of photographs
of every driver in
                   Colorado, will it be used only to protect against
criminals?" Gordon
                   asked. "Or will it be used for commercial purposes or
marketing or to
                   produce books of people's photos. We have to be
                   Colorado's new system could pave the way for expanded
use, say for
                   instance tapping into a criminal database and finding
out if someone
                   getting a driver license is a fugitive.
                   "I'm sure law enforcement would appreciate it
sometime in the
                   future," Dalquist said. "Right now, we're not hooking
into their data
                   process. We're trying to protect citizens against
identity fraud, and
                   businesses, too."
                   But some say this latest technology could continue to
grow into a
                   Tampa-like monitoring system.
                   Last month, Denver police used low-tech, hand-held
video cameras to
                   catch rowdy partygoers celebrating the Colorado
Avalanche's Stanley
                   Cup victory.
                   "We haven't discussed it," said Denver police Sgt.
Tony Lombard, "not
                   at this point."

DAILY MAIL (London) June 11, 2001 LENGTH: 705 words A SPEED CAMERA ON
EVERY CORNER
DAILY MAIL (London)
June 12, 2001
POLICE WILL ISSUE UP TO TEN MILLION TICKETS A YEAR IN A MASSIVE
CLAMPDOWN ON SPEEDING MOTORISTS. WITH THE
NUMBER OF SPEED CAMERAS EXPECTED TO TREBLE, THERE WILL be no escape from
the prying electronic eyes.
For the police, it will mean a gold-mine in fines thanks to the decision
to allow forces to keep money
raised from fixed penalties. Until now, many of the 4,300 cameras across
the country have been
ineffective because police cannot afford to stock or process the film.
But the potential to raise revenue has given them a powerful incentive
to extend and improve the network.
This means any driver 'flashed' by a camera will now almost certainly
face a fine.
The speeding clampdown comes as the latest crime figures show a
year-on-year rise of 2.5 per cent in
violent offences including murder, rape and muggings.
Yesterday, motoring groups claimed the blitz would undermine public
confidence in police priorities.
As well as alienating drivers already burdened by high fuel taxes and
rising crime, more cameras would
never be as effective as patrol cars in preventing truly dangerous
driving, they said. Police, however,
are delighted with the prospect of more cameras on the roads.
Some areas involved in trial schemes have seen 25-fold increases in the
number of tickets issued to
If these results are reflected across the country, the number of
penalties issued via roadside cameras
could soar from 550,000 in 1999 to more than ten million.
North Wales chief constable Richard Brun-strom, who leads the
Association of Chief Police Officers'
traffic technology committee is keen to see more cameras on the roads.
'Speed cameras make a major contribution to road safety and this
legislation means motorists can expect
to see at least a tripling in the numbers on Britain's roads,' he said.
Under new Home Office rules, money raised by fines will no longer go
straight to the Treasury.
Instead, police will be allowed to keep fixed penalty revenue above a
'baseline' figure. Almost all the
43 forces in England and Wales are submitting business plans to the
Government to show how they will use
the extra money.
The standard penalty increased last year from GBP 40 to GBP 60, and m
Edmund King of the RAC Foundation said: 'The danger is that speed
cameras actually lead to our roads
being under-policed.
'With an over-reliance on speed cameras, forces have been cutting back
on traffic police.
'In some areas there is little or no chance of being stopped for
dangerous or careless driving, which is
often more dangerous than speeding.
'Only around a third of accidents are blamed on speed.
'Cameras don't pick up on drivers tailgating the car in front, or
swerving between lanes.
'Home Office research revealed a 60 per cent chance of dangerous drivers
having committed other criminal
'Those stopped may have burgled goods in the car, for example. Cameras
won't clear up any of those other
'We are already seeing cameras being extended beyond accident blackspots
to straight stretches of rural
road in places like Oxfordshire.
'If that trend continues there is the danger we will see speed cameras
on every bend in every trunk road.
'We don't believe that is something motorists want to see, and nor do
Yesterday, Home Secretary David Blunkett signalled his determination not
to let the new financial rules
distract police from their core purpose of fighting crime.
A source close to Mr Blunkett said: 'Road safety is important, but we
don't want to see manpower diverted
to running speed cameras.
'The cameras are a valuable tool but we have to strike a balance.'

                       Millimeter-wave energy to be
                       used in a weapon
                       By Peter Clarke
                       EE Times
                       June 6, 2001 (5:39 p.m. EST)
                       LONDON Â Stories of the soldiers who
                       operate the Arctic radar stations and stand
                       in front of the transmitter to get warm will
                       surely be repeated now that the U.S.
                       Department of Defense has gone public with
                       plans to use the heating effect of millimeter
                       waves within a weapon.
                       The U.S. Marine Corps says it has developed
                       a 95-GHz system as an antipersonnel "heat
                       ray" and is conducting tests on animals and
                       volunteers.
                       The supposedly nonlethal weapon, called
                       "active-denial technology," has been in the
                       works for the last 10 years at the Air Force
                       Research Laboratory (Kirtland, N.M.), in
                       tandem with the Marine Corps' Joint
                       Non-lethal Weapons Directorate. About $40
                       million has been spent developing the
                       weapon, according to the Air Force Research
                       Laboratory (AFRL), although it could be
                       nearly another decade before it is used in
                       conflict. The earliest estimate for deployment
                       is 2009.
                       The system includes a millimeter-wave
                       energy source with waveguides to direct the
                       energy to a dish antenna measuring about 3
                       x 3 meters, which forms a beam that can be
                       swept across a battlefield or hostile crowd.
                       The aim is to deter or drive off adversaries
                       caught out in the open with a beam that
                       inflicts pain without causing permanent
                       damage.
                       According to an AFRL fact sheet, the 95-GHz
                       energy penetrates 1/64 inch into the skin
                       and produces an intense burning sensation
                       that stops when the transmitter is switched
                       off or when the individual moves out of the
                       beam.
                       Top skin layer takes heat
                       "It works by heating the water molecules in
                       the top 1/64-of-an-inch layer of the skin,"
                       said Marine Corps spokesman Maj. David
                       Andersen.
                       According to reports, a 2-second burst from
                       the system can heat the skin to a
                       temperature of 130Â° F. Elsewhere, the AFRL
                       describes the sensation as similar to
                       touching an ordinary light bulb that has
                       been left on for a while. "Unlike a light bulb,
                       however," says the AFRL fact sheet,
                       "active-denial technology will not cause
                       rapid burning, because of the shallow
                       penetration of the beam and the low levels
                       of energy used."
                       Beam size, whether it is a convergent,
                       focused beam or a divergent beam, and its
                       range are all classified information.
                       "This is a beam that is going to be directed.
                       It's not harmful to internal organs because it
                       doesn't penetrate the skin beyond 1/64 of an
                       inch," said Conrad Dziewulski, a spokesman
                       for the directed-energy division of AFRL. "It
                       will be swept across the battlefield or
                       directed at an individual for a few seconds."
                       Dziewulski said the system was intended to
                       protect military personnel against
                       small-arms fire, which is generally taken to
                       mean a range of 1,000 meters. Elsewhere,
                       the system is described as having a range of
                       700 yards.
                       While early tests have been carried out using
                       a fixed antenna, the military now plans to
                       develop a mobile version of the system,
                       otherwise known as Vehicle Mounted Active
                       Denial System, or Vmads.
                       AFRL said Vmads could be mounted on a
                       High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle
                       (more commonly referred to as a Humvee).
                       Later it could be mounted on other vehicles
                       such as aircraft, helicopters and ships,
                       officials said.
                       However, countermeasures against the
                       weapon could be quite straightforward Â for
                       example covering up the body with thick
                       clothes or carrying a metallic sheet Â or
                       even a trash can lid Â as a shield or
                       reflector. Also unclear is how the
                       active-denial technology would work in rainy,
                       foggy or sea-spray conditions where the
                       beam's energy could be absorbed by water
                       in the atmosphere.
                       The technology was developed by two Air
                       Force Research Laboratory teams: one from
                       the laboratory's Directed Energy Directorate
                       at Kirtland Air Force Base, and the other
                       from the Human Effectiveness Directorate at
                       Brooks Air Force Base, Texas.
                       The Air Force's Electronic Systems Center at
                       Hanscom Air Force Base, Mass., will manage
                       acquisition of the Humvee Vmads system.

Mobile phones may foil stealth bombers
                By Robert Uhlig in London
                America's multi-billion-dollar stealth bombers could be
rendered obsolete
                by a British invention that uses existing mobile
telephone masts to detect
                and track aircraft that were previously invisible to
                US stealth fighters and bombers such as the F117, B1 and
B2 played key
                roles in the Gulf and Kosovan wars as they are almost
impossible to detect
                using conventional radar.
                However, the ease with which the mobile telephone mast
system -
                developed at a laboratory in Hampshire - can be used to
detect the aircraft
                has greatly concerned the military.
                Mr Peter Lloyd, the head of projects at Roke Manor
Research, said: "I
                cannot comment in detail because it is a classified
matter, but let's say the
                US military is very interested."
                Stealth aircraft, each of which costs at least $A3.6
billion, are shaped to
                confuse radar. A special paint absorbs radio waves,
reducing the radar
                signature to the equivalent of a gull in flight.
                The Roke Manor scientists discovered that telephone
calls sent between
                mobile phone masts detected the precise position of
stealth aircraft with
                ease. "We use just the normal phone calls that are
flying about in the ether,"
                Mr Lloyd said. "The front of the stealth plane cannot be
detected by
                conventional radar, but its bottom surface reflects very
                Mobile telephone calls bouncing between base stations
produce a screen of
                radiation. When the aircraft fly through this screen
they disrupt the phase
                pattern of the signals. The Roke Manor system uses
receivers, shaped like
                television aerials, to detect distortions in the
                A network of aerials large enough to cover a battlefield
can be packed in a
                Land Rover.
                Using a laptop connected to the receiver network,
soldiers on the ground
                can calculate the position of stealth aircraft with an
accuracy of 10 metres
                with the aid of the GPS satellite navigation system.
                "It's remarkable that a stealth system that cost Â£60
billion [$158 billion] to
                develop is beaten by Â£100,000 mobile phone technology,"
Mr Lloyd said.
                "It's almost impossible to disable a mobile phone
network without bombing
                an entire country, whereas radar installations are often
knocked out of
                action with a single bomb or missile."

Of course, anyone who advances fascism at this time is a *collaborator*
Maybe a tree will martyr itself by jumping into her way as she's
                        Rep. Mary Bono, R-Palm
                          Springs, on Friday warned
                          that the country should
                          prepare for a fight against
                          international terrorists that
                          will likely include personal
                          sacrifice, the use of ground
                          troops overseas and the risk
                          of retaliation against civilians
                          by the enemy.
                          In a wide-ranging interview, Bono gave dire
                          of an immediate future she predicted could
