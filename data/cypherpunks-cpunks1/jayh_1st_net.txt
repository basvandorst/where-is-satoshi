People seem to overlook that throughout most of human history (as well as most indigenous societies), 'artists' had productive day jobs and did their creative work out of personal desire.
By and large, the concept that people should make a good living simply by creating art is a modern aberration.

An interesting point and a serious threat to privacy. Alas I would like to see a more reliable source forthcoming than Worldnetdaily.

The USA PATRIOT act forbids a library from talking
hmmmm... does that mean the by declaring that his library does not have than info, and thus has not provided info to the feds, is that declaration in itself a violation of USA PATRIOT?

My comment was basically a musing, but nonetheless technically since it is a crime to reveal that the feds have gotten information, it would seem that declaring that they have not provided information is in itself a declaration about fed activity and so You are right, that librarians are upset. However the situation is such that librarians have been specifically warned that if they call the ALA about such a visit, they cannot say anything in their conversation that they are calling in regards to such a request. The most they are allowed to say in such phone conversations is that they would like to talk to a lawyer.
This is a very bad precedent.

This assumes the truthfulness of the fundamental premise, that an artist can both share information, and yet control it after it's shared. This is more an artifact of our time than a fundamental moral principle of nature.
Throughout most of human history, information was either secret, or it was public knowledge... no other choices.

This idea will die once substantial numbers of movie goers start getting headaches and vertigo. I think this would be, at best, a Pyrrhic victory. j ---------- Original Message ---------------------------------- Sent via the WebMail system at 1st.net

Apparently artwork depicting the horror war is just to disconcerting a backdrop for Ambassador Negroponte as he rallies the troops.

We don't want war presented as anything but whoesome entertainment.

Not necessarily. It is a well documented phenomenon that people show up at hospitals with even some seemingly real conditions whenever there is a particular panic in the media, even in cases where it is simply not possible that they were made sick by the incident.
(Assuming of course that even the reports of treatment are themselves accurate, which is doubtable under the circumstances.)
<----- Original Text ----->
The press was reporting that some dozens of people went to
hospitals after encountering shuttle parts,
and about 8 were actually treated for something,
between lung or skin problems (presumably chemical burns of some sort.)
So it's not totally harmless.

Prosecutors have actually argued that people who talked about NOT doing particular things were actually code talking about commiting the crimes.
Sheesh. we're all guilty.
