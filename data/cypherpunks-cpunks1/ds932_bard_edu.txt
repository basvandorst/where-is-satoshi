Just playing the Devil's Advocate here.
Are you allowed to go into a theatre and yell, "FIRE!!!" when there is
none?  Nope.  There *are* restrictions on speech.  If MS's "speech" violated somebody's
rights, that speech can be made illegal.
PS I agree that code is speech.

I see your point...prior restraint sucks, but I disagree with you that
speech cannot violate rights.  What about slander or libel?  I believe
that I have the right not to be publicly ridiculed and to be made the
subject of untrue statements against my character.  But that's the limit.
I think that's about the limit of restriction on speech.  But the reality of it is, prior restraint *does* exist, and seeing as code
is speech, the same restrictions that apply to speech apply to code.  I am
pretty much talking out of my ass (because I am not a lawyer), but what I
just said makes sense.

Isn't there some sort of rule where at the first mention of "Hitler" or
"Nazi", it's the end of the thread? ;)
Heh.  Maybe ridicule wasn't the right word.  I can take a joke, ridicule
is ok.  I guess a better word would have been "unjustified slander" (OK,
that's two).  Satire and ridicule are good things, and are
protected...this is good.
But now, I am beginning to see what you are saying.  We shouldn't blame
*speech* for the result of speech.  It's the *result* of said speech that
should be the grounds of wrongness.  Makes sense to me.

Hmmm...good point.  I should have thought of that before.

Whatever.  Lets not be too serious.
Never said I was an expert.

Somehow I feel that my position (although now I see that I was wrong), was
a Nazi-related view.  That and I was only partially serious.
