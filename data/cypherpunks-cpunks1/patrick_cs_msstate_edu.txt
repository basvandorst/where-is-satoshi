As a sideline to all of this serious discussion:
I was re-reading one of my favorite SF books the other day, Daniel
Keys Moran's _The Long Run_ (published by Bantam, ~1989, now out of
print, despite its popularity) and it has an interesting anecedote to
the Clipper debate:
In _The Long Run _(tLR), the Network on Earth is essentially uncontrolled
despite the best efforts of the government because it was created without their
direct control; it's creation was over and done with before they could get
their nosy little fingers involved. Meanwhile, the Lunar network (separate from
the Earth network becasue of the time it takes data to go from earth to the
moon and back) is stricly controlled by the Lunar Information Network Key
(LINK), an encryption system which monitors all traffic on the network and must
approve all transactions.  (Of course, all government transactions are
Sounds sort of cliiper-esque, eh?
Of course, the hero of the book, Trent, doesn't like this system...  :-)
If I get a chance and there's the demand, I'll type in Moran's description of
the LINK...
Good reading if you can find it.

So, can we turn in the State Department and NSA for restraint of trade?

I wrote some code about six months ago to embed digital signatures
of each section of an executable in to the data section of a program
(a.out format executables). The program had several limitations that I know how to get around, but never did:
1. I only got as far signing the text section of the program
2. The signature didn't contain several important pieces of information
3. It used LUC for its algorithm, and I'd prefer to use PGP and RSAREF
Anyway, it some provides minimal security:
 If the signature is intact and verifies, you know exactly as much as
with a signed e-mail message: the author of the program (assuming you have
his public key) and that certain portions of the program haven't been tampered with. This is, of course useful information. I never got around
to writing the code that did verification at runtime, although it shouldn't be to bad: I embedded a symbol in the symbol table pointing to the signature.
I plan to try to clean it up this fall and make many changes...

foolproof runtime verification would be quite difficult, although I
still need to think about it... Any reasonable hacker would just
change most programs to jump around the verification routines. On the
other hand, I think that pre-runtime verification would be doable by a
separate program. Of course, then you have to trust that program, and
how do you verify that it hasn't been tampered with? A chicken and the egg problem, clearly... Let me think about it some more...

The best I can think of (right now) is embedding digital signatures in
the file.  One way or another, the program is going to have be
decrypted to run (unless you're using NSA`s patented EES4400 2500 MHz
0.1 micron run-encrypted CPU :-) ).  Anyone with a debugger and a
disassembler could then derive a version of the program as it decrypts
and make a hacked up version. At least if a digital signature is in
the program and it verifies _with a program you trust_ (a very
important point), then you know who last signed it. (and who to blame
if it does something wrong or vindictive) Doing verification inside the program is just too messy, since a good
cracker could set up your program to always act like verified
correctly even if it was modified. It may be more difficult if the
program is encrypted, but it is still doable...
Since you almost always trust the kernel (you sort of have to on most
machines, since it can f*ck with you in so many ways, by stealing your
PGP passphrase, for example), the kernel loader might be a good place
to do this verification for important programs. (It would slow the
machine down to much to do this for _every_ program, IMHO) If a user
wants to verify his program, make the external verification program be
checked by the kernel...
In the end, you have to trust someone. Just choose very carefully
who you trust.
I guess I sort of got off on a tangent, but, oh well... I guess I need
to go revise (perhaps rewrite) my signature-embedding program,
since "cypherpunks write code." :-)

So, what about FOIA requests? Is the algorithm classified SECRET or some such nonsense? If you can
get hold of it (as a company) without a clearance,
couldn't someone just file a Freedom of Information Act request for the document?
