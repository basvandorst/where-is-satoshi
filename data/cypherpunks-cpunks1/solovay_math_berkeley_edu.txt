@_subject: How Many Games of Chess? 
I seem to remember from way back in high school that the number of potential moves by the third set of moves is on the order of billions of legal moves.
(number of starting squares) times 64 (number of destination squares)
x 4 [number of ways a pawn can promote]. Thus we get the bound 16, 384
[which can be easily improved] which is way less than "billions of
possible moves". The same computation shows that the number of
possible games of length n grows at worst expoentially pace mr
The right way to think about this is to get sharp upper bounds rather
than attempt a precise calculation. A crude upper bound would be
longerst possible game is about 6000 moves [using the 50 move rule].
At most 2**16 mves per position so at most 10**[192 * 10**6] games.
I'm sure that sharper estimates are readily available.

@_subject: Dorothy Denning at it again 
Just thought I would mention that if any of you haven't yet read Dorothy
Denning's contributions to the clipper debate in RISKS 15.48 you should
probably ought to do so.
Question: How does one access RISKS 15.48

@_subject: Magic money not working bigendian 
Is there a simple way to find out if ones computer is big-endian or
not? [Like a simple C program that one can compile and run to settle
the question.]

@_subject: The books you showed at the Mountain View meeting 
I'd be very greatful for a bibliography of these books [= list of
authors and titles. ISBN's and Publishers would help if they are
readily available.] I'm sure that many others on the cpunk list would
also be interest in this.
