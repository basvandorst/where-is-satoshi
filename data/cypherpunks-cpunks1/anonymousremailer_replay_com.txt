Many people don't have mime mailers, and if you want to talk to them, you can't use mime features.  You can tell them that they're stupid not to have better software or accounts, but until getting PPP running is as easy as installing the aol client, you'll just be pissing in the wind.
You don't know it but you are.
Is this list supposed to convey ideas or demonstrate the latest email standards?  I'm not sure the two goals are compatible.
