 "cypherpunks Because of the follow message(s), I feel the need to set the record straight.  For the record, I have no intention of putting any 'bets', 'donations', or 'predictions' into Sanjuro's (or anyone else's) 'Assassination Market'-type system!  First, as I think will be obvious, I am merely one of about 7.1 billion humans on Earth.  Any 'bets' I would make would be insignificant and therefore superfluous.  Secondly, right now I consider investing in my isotope-modified fiber-optic invention       as being by far my highest priority.  (My primary need at this point is raising money to 'buy' about 100 national-stage patents from nations around the world.  There is no international patent system, at least other than Europe.  An invention must be patented in any nation where patent protection is desired.)  Disclaimer:  I am not involved with Sanjuro's 'Assassination Market' in any way.  I do not know who he is.

From that article:
     Quantum cryptography can't be broken by factorisation. Could it one day replace standard cryptosystems?
 short distances it wouldn't be too hard to build a quantum key distribution network to encrypt data. Over longer distances, you would need quantum repeaters every 50 kilometres or so on the fibre-optic network, as it's difficult to maintain a quantum state over long distances. Even if they are cheap by then, it's a lot of investment.
=====end of quote=====
My fiber optic invention has a certain relevance here. A typical modern germania-doped-core (GeO2) silica optical fiber has a loss of about 0.19 decibels/kilometer (db/km).  Over 50 km, the loss is (50 km x 0.19 db/km) = 9.5 db, ignoring splice losses.  (A good splice has a loss of about 0.10 db.)  So, the quote above is indicating that above a loss of about 10 db, a quantum system is hard to maintain.  I have suggested in my patent application that isotope-modified fiber (where the Si-29 level is brought from nature's 4.67% (atom/atom) to 0.10 %, the loss might decrease by a factor of 10 to 20.  This means that the ultimate distance limit might increase to 50 x 10 = 500 km, to 50 x 20 = 1000 km.  That would be a major improvement if it works.
The reason that this new fiber would be necessary is this:  Ever since the invention of the EDFA (Erbium-doped fiber amplifier    ) in 1986, it has been used to amplify IR signals in the 1510-1560 nanometer band.  Using it and ordinary signals (not quantum signals) it is possible to go about 125 kilometers between amplifiers.  (In other words, that usage tolerates about 25 db of optical loss before an EDFA is necessary.)  However, apparently an EDFA cannot be used to amplify a quantum system.       Or, at least, not directly.

brian carroll Okay, thank you for clarifying this matter.  I merely Google-searched for  'EDFA quantum entanglement' and found and cited this paper, and that only because it referred to the problem of trying to amplify quantum signals through an EDFA.  Myself, I am hoping that longer-key public-key cryptosystems will remain unsolved by quantum techniques, at least as long as it takes to get rid of governments.  After that, it probably won't matter.  As of now, it looks like things will go the way I'd like.

I am limited by the fact that I have only had a couple of classes which touched upon quantum physics (and 35 years ago, to boot), I wonder if there will be some limit to how far these quantum techniques can be used to factor huge numbers. (Speculation warning!)   A 1 centimeter difference in altitude in Earth's gravitational field results in about a 1 part in 10**18 time dilation.  Even if the atoms making up a quantum computer could be maintained  within 1 micron altitude, that would be a time dilation difference of 1 part in 10**22.   Could there be an effect which would allow the factorization of numbers up to, say, 22 digits long, but that would fail if the number was 301 digits long?  (equivalent to 1024 bits.)   Such a computer might be raised into earth orbit to take advantage of micro-gravity effects, but even that might only raise the limit by a few orders of magnitude, say 22+6 = 28.  Someone much more familiar with quantum mechanics
 should be able to shed light on this speculation.

@_subject: Exclusive: Secret contract tied NSA and security industry pioneer 
By Joseph Menn SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As a key part of a campaign to embed encryption software that it could crack into widely used computer products, the U.S. National Security Agency arranged a secret $10 million contract with RSA, one of the most influential firms in the computer security industry, Reuters has learned.
Documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden show that the NSA created and promulgated a flawed formula for generating random numbers to create a "back door" in encryption products, the New York Times reported in September. Reuters later reported that RSA became the most important distributor of that formula by rolling it into a software tool called Bsafe that is used to enhance security in personal computers and many other products.
Undisclosed until now was that RSA received $10 million in a deal that set the NSA formula as the preferred, or default, method for number generation in the BSafe software, according to two sources familiar with the contract. Although that sum might seem paltry, it represented more than a third of the revenue that the relevant division at RSA had taken in during the entire previous year, securities filings show.
The earlier disclosures of RSA's entanglement with the NSA already had shocked some in the close-knit world of computer security experts. The company had a long history of championing privacy and security, and it played a leading role in blocking a 1990s effort by the NSA to require a special chip to enable spying on a wide range of computer and communications products.
RSA, now a subsidiary of computer storage giant EMC Corp, urged customers to stop using the NSA formula after the Snowden disclosures revealed its weakness.
RSA and EMC declined to answer questions for this story, but RSA said in a statement: "RSA always acts in the best interest of its customers and under no circumstances does RSA design or enable any back doors in our products. Decisions about the features and functionality of RSA products are our own."
The NSA declined to comment.
The RSA deal shows one way the NSA carried out what Snowden's documents describe as a key strategy for enhancing surveillance: the systematic erosion of security tools. NSA documents released in recent months called for using "commercial relationships" to advance that goal, but did not name any security companies as collaborators.
The NSA came under attack this week in a landmark report from a White House panel appointed to review U.S. surveillance policy. The panel noted that "encryption is an essential basis for trust on the Internet," and called for a halt to any NSA efforts to undermine it.
Most of the dozen current and former RSA employees interviewed said that the company erred in agreeing to such a contract, and many cited RSA's corporate evolution away from pure cryptography products as one of the reasons it occurred.
But several said that RSA also was misled by government officials, who portrayed the formula as a secure technological advance.
"They did not show their true hand," one person briefed on the deal said of the NSA, asserting that government officials did not let on that they knew how to break the encryption.
STORIED HISTORY
 View gallery    A National Security Agency (NSA) data gathering facility is seen in Bluffdale, about 25 miles (40 km …
Started by MIT professors in the 1970s and led for years by ex-Marine Jim Bidzos, RSA and its core algorithm were both named for the last initials of the three founders, who revolutionized cryptography. Little known to the public, RSA's encryption tools have been licensed by most large technology companies, which in turn use them to protect computers used by hundreds of millions of people.
At the core of RSA's products was a technology known as public key cryptography. Instead of using the same key for encoding and then decoding a message, there are two keys related to each other mathematically. The first, publicly available key is used to encode a message for someone, who then uses a second, private key to reveal it.
From RSA's earliest days, the U.S. intelligence establishment worried it would not be able to crack well-engineered public key cryptography. Martin Hellman, a former Stanford researcher who led the team that first invented the technique, said NSA experts tried to talk him and others into believing that the keys did not have to be as large as they The stakes rose when more technology companies adopted RSA's methods and Internet use began to soar. The Clinton administration embraced the Clipper Chip, envisioned as a mandatory component in phones and computers to enable officials to overcome encryption with a warrant.
RSA led a fierce public campaign against the effort, distributing posters with a foundering sailing ship and the words "Sink Clipper!"
A key argument against the chip was that overseas buyers would shun U.S. technology products if they were ready-made for spying. Some companies say that is just what has happened in the wake of the Snowden The White House abandoned the Clipper Chip and instead relied on export controls to prevent the best cryptography from crossing U.S. borders. RSA once again rallied the industry, and it set up an Australian division that could ship what it wanted.
"We became the tip of the spear, so to speak, in this fight against government efforts," Bidzos recalled in an oral history.
RSA EVOLVES
RSA and others claimed victory when export restrictions relaxed.
But the NSA was determined to read what it wanted, and the quest gained urgency after the September 11, 2001 attacks.
RSA, meanwhile, was changing. Bidzos stepped down as CEO in 1999 to concentrate on VeriSign, a security certificate company that had been spun out of RSA. The elite lab Bidzos had founded in Silicon Valley moved east to Massachusetts, and many top engineers left the company, several former employees said.
And the BSafe toolkit was becoming a much smaller part of the company. By 2005, BSafe and other tools for developers brought in just $27.5 million of RSA's revenue, less than 9% of the $310 million total.
"When I joined there were 10 people in the labs, and we were fighting the NSA," said Victor Chan, who rose to lead engineering and the Australian operation before he left in 2005. "It became a very different company later on."
By the first half of 2006, RSA was among the many technology companies seeing the U.S. government as a partner against overseas hackers.
New RSA Chief Executive Art Coviello and his team still wanted to be seen as part of the technological vanguard, former employees say, and the NSA had just the right pitch. Coviello declined an interview An algorithm called Dual Elliptic Curve, developed inside the agency, was on the road to approval by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology as one of four acceptable methods for generating random numbers. NIST's blessing is required for many products sold to the government and often sets a broader de facto standard.
RSA adopted the algorithm even before NIST approved it. The NSA then cited the early use of Dual Elliptic Curve inside the government to argue successfully for NIST approval, according to an official familiar with the proceedings.
RSA's contract made Dual Elliptic Curve the default option for producing random numbers in the RSA toolkit. No alarms were raised, former employees said, because the deal was handled by business leaders rather than pure technologists.
"The labs group had played a very intricate role at BSafe, and they were basically gone," said labs veteran Michael Wenocur, who left in 1999.
Within a year, major questions were raised about Dual Elliptic Curve. Cryptography authority Bruce Schneier wrote that the weaknesses in the formula "can only be described as a back door."
After reports of the back door in September, RSA urged its customers to stop using the Dual Elliptic Curve number generator.
But unlike the Clipper Chip fight two decades ago, the company is saying little in public, and it declined to discuss how the NSA entanglements have affected its relationships with customers.
The White House, meanwhile, says it will consider this week's panel recommendation that any efforts to subvert cryptography be abandoned.

Privacy Advocate Exposes High-Tech NSA Spy Gadgets Monday, 30 Dec 2013 03:43 PM
Share: A well-known privacy advocate has given the public an unusually explicit peek into the intelligence world's tool box, pulling back the curtain on the National Security Agency's arsenal of high-tech spy gear.
Independent journalist and security expert Jacob Appelbaum on Monday told a hacker conference in Germany that the NSA could turn iPhones into eavesdropping tools and use radar wave devices to harvest electronic information from computer even if they weren't online.
Appelbaum told hundreds of computer experts gathered at Hamburg's Chaos Communications Conference that his revelations about the NSA's capabilities "are even worse than your worst nightmares."
"What I am going to show you today is wrist-slittingly depressing," he said.
Even though in the past six months there have been an unprecedented level of public scrutiny of the NSA and its methods, Appelbaum's claims — supported by what appeared to be internal NSA slideshows — still caused a stir.
One of the slides described how the NSA can plant malicious software onto Apple Inc.'s iPhone, giving American intelligence agents the ability to turn the popular smartphone into a pocket-sized spy.
Another slide showcased a futuristic-sounding device described as a "portable continuous wave generator," a remote controlled device which — when paired with tiny electronic implants — can bounce invisible waves of energy off keyboards and monitors to see what is being typed even if the target device isn't connected to the Internet.
A third slide showcased a piece of equipment called NIGHTSTAND, which can tamper with wireless Internet connections from up to 8 miles away.
An NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines said that she wasn't aware of Appelbaum's presentation, but that in general should would not comment on "alleged foreign intelligence activities."
"As we've said before:  NSA's focus is on targeting the communications of valid foreign intelligence targets — not on collecting and exploiting a class of communications or services that would sweep up communications that are not of bona fide foreign intelligence interest to the U.S. government."
The documents included in Appelbaum's presentation were first published by German magazine Der Spiegel Sunday and Monday.
Appelbaum and Der Spiegel have both played an important role in the disclosures of NSA leaker Edward Snowden, but neither has clarified whether the most recent set of slides came from Snowden.

    I think my 'counter-surveillance' was a factor, but not in the way most (relatively uninformed) people might think.  You see, upon my release in April 2000, I strongly suspected that the Feds had been engaging in corruption and illegal actions against me (Google 'Ryan Thomas Lund'; also, it's in the July 2003 re-filing of my lawsuit 'Revision 1.06'        ) and I publicly announced that I would be investigating the facts and would eventually file a lawsuit. Primarily, during the summer of 2000, I visited the last-registered-addresses of vehicles that had been used on Father's Day Sunday 1998 to surveill me when I drove to a relative's house to attend her birthday party.  I suspected that those vehicles had been acquired by the Feds, and that they WOULDN'T be found at their last registered address.  (I had the Oregon DMV database on CDROM).  Turns out, I was absolutely correct.   (see, for example, 
    )
    What I DIDN'T know (in April 2000) was that since June 1999, the Feds had been faking an appeal in the 9th Circuit court of appeals (case 99-30210).  Quite literally, the appeal was initiated, and from the record it would have appeared that I was trying to handle the appeal myself.  But nobody told me about that appeal, and in fact at least a couple dozen pieces of legal mail that should have come to me at (first) Seatac FDC jail, and subsequently Phoenix FCI prison, were stolen (never delivered) by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) staff.  Further, I knew nothing of the law at that time.   (Note:  This version of the lawsuit was finalized under trying circumstances just days after I had first read the docket for appeal case 99-30210, so I couldn't write in detail about that fake appeal.  Subsequent amendments (around September 2004, as I recall) were far more detailed in my accusations.)
  The number of Federal felonies that were committed against me must have been immense.  Why they initiated, and kept secret, this fake appeal case, I still do not know.  But _THEY_ KNEW what they had done.  And, in about April 2000, I wrote a letter to the Ninth Circuit (still entirely unaware of case 99-30210) asking for an appeal in the underlying probation-revocation case.  (97-5270).  (I had been told by a 'jailhouse lawyer' in about January 2000 that I had a right to an appeal of that case).  At the time, I didn't know that to get an appeal, I'd have had to ask for an appeal (send in a "Notice of Appeal" document) within 10 working days of the 'entry of judgment' on the case.  I hadn't done that, and by the rules they would have been able to refuse me that appeal.  EXCEPT that there was ALREADY an appeal going, 99-30210!   And my request for an appeal, coupled with my public statements that I suspected corruption, probably put a world of
 fear into those who had been committing those crimes against me.  They knew I was on their track, and they presumably were afraid that I would discover what they had done.
    What I think was done was this:  They assigned a corrupt lawyer, ostensibly to represent me, "Jonathan Solovy", after having RE-forged the docket for appeal 99-30210 (probably in May 2000).  Solovy's job, as I later derived, was to APPEAR to write and file that appeal.  He did, and he lost.  But he didn't send me a copy of the docket for that case.  Had he done so, or had he asked me one of one hundred questions ("I see you've been working on this appeal for 10 months!  What are your appeal issues...?) I would have been instantly alerted that I hadn't initiated that appeal in April 2000, as I thought I had.  Solovy's job was to conceal from me the corrupt nature of the events around appeal 99-30210, and he did so.  I found out the true nature of fake appeal 99-30210 about June 20, 2003, after I received a copy of the docket for that case from the clerks' office of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
The corrupt lawyer, Robert Leen, was assigned to me about November 21, 2000.  I learned early that he didn't intend to actually defend me.  I sent a letter to the (corrupt) judge Tanner about December 8, 2000, telling him that I had 'fired' Leen.  Tanner's response was to refuse to let me fire Leen.  At that point, I realized that I would be fighting not merely the prosecution, but also 'my' attorney and the judge.  I began learning the law, and put a lot of effort into self-written motions and objections.  I even filed a 'Notice of Interlocutory Appeal' in late March 2001, just before my 'trial', which divested jurisdiction from that court to proceed.  Naturally, they simply ignored this, Leen, prosecutor Robb London (who currently works as the Communications Director at Harvard Law School), and judge Tanner.    Much of this is described in my lawsuit.   Like I said, the level of corruption used against me was immense.

Since the issue was just raised about me needing a PGP key (presumably, for now, just for signing purposes), it occurred to me that the best way to get that key signed would be for me to attend a meeting of Cypherpunks.  Since many such meetings occur in the Bay Area (San Francisco and environs) I could come from Vancouver Washington (Just across the Columbia river from Portland) and attend an upcoming Cypherpunks meeting.  What I'd appreciate would be a local who could provide transportation (I don't do 'credit card' and they probably wouldn't rent a car to me if I did!), and possibly a place to stay for 2-3 days.  Does this sound like a plan?  I could bring my BOP (Bureau of Prisons) ID, smuggled out when I was released, and auction it off for bitcoins, to pay for my expenses. (It's sure to be a collector's item someday!)

From that article:
     Quantum cryptography can't be broken by factorisation. Could it one day replace standard cryptosystems?
 short distances it wouldn't be too hard to build a quantum key distribution network to encrypt data. Over longer distances, you would need quantum repeaters every 50 kilometres or so on the fibre-optic network, as it's difficult to maintain a quantum state over long distances. Even if they are cheap by then, it's a lot of investment.
=====end of quote=====
My fiber optic invention has a certain relevance here. A typical modern germania-doped-core (GeO2) silica optical fiber has a loss of about 0.19 decibels/kilometer (db/km).  Over 50 km, the loss is (50 km x 0.19 db/km) = 9.5 db, ignoring splice losses.  (A good splice has a loss of about 0.10 db.)  So, the quote above is indicating that above a loss of about 10 db, a quantum system is hard to maintain.  I have suggested in my patent application that isotope-modified fiber (where the Si-29 level is brought from nature's 4.67% (atom/atom) to 0.10 %, the loss might decrease by a factor of 10 to 20.  This means that the ultimate distance limit might increase to 50 x 10 = 500 km, to 50 x 20 = 1000 km.  That would be a major improvement if it works.
The reason that this new fiber would be necessary is this:  Ever since the invention of the EDFA (Erbium-doped fiber amplifier    ) in 1986, it has been used to amplify IR signals in the 1510-1560 nanometer band.  Using it and ordinary signals (not quantum signals) it is possible to go about 125 kilometers between amplifiers.  (In other words, that usage tolerates about 25 db of optical loss before an EDFA is necessary.)  However, apparently an EDFA cannot be used to amplify a quantum system.       Or, at least, not directly.

I am limited by the fact that I have only had a couple of classes which touched upon quantum physics (and 35 years ago, to boot), I wonder if there will be some limit to how far these quantum techniques can be used to factor huge numbers. (Speculation warning!)   A 1 centimeter difference in altitude in Earth's gravitational field results in about a 1 part in 10**18 time dilation.  Even if the atoms making up a quantum computer could be maintained  within 1 micron altitude, that would be a time dilation difference of 1 part in 10**22.   Could there be an effect which would allow the factorization of numbers up to, say, 22 digits long, but that would fail if the number was 301 digits long?  (equivalent to 1024 bits.)   Such a computer might be raised into earth orbit to take advantage of micro-gravity effects, but even that might only raise the limit by a few orders of magnitude, say 22+6 = 28.  Someone much more familiar with quantum mechanics
 should be able to shed light on this speculation.

@_subject: Exclusive: Secret contract tied NSA and security industry pioneer 
By Joseph Menn SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As a key part of a campaign to embed encryption software that it could crack into widely used computer products, the U.S. National Security Agency arranged a secret $10 million contract with RSA, one of the most influential firms in the computer security industry, Reuters has learned.
Documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden show that the NSA created and promulgated a flawed formula for generating random numbers to create a "back door" in encryption products, the New York Times reported in September. Reuters later reported that RSA became the most important distributor of that formula by rolling it into a software tool called Bsafe that is used to enhance security in personal computers and many other products.
Undisclosed until now was that RSA received $10 million in a deal that set the NSA formula as the preferred, or default, method for number generation in the BSafe software, according to two sources familiar with the contract. Although that sum might seem paltry, it represented more than a third of the revenue that the relevant division at RSA had taken in during the entire previous year, securities filings show.
The earlier disclosures of RSA's entanglement with the NSA already had shocked some in the close-knit world of computer security experts. The company had a long history of championing privacy and security, and it played a leading role in blocking a 1990s effort by the NSA to require a special chip to enable spying on a wide range of computer and communications products.
RSA, now a subsidiary of computer storage giant EMC Corp, urged customers to stop using the NSA formula after the Snowden disclosures revealed its weakness.
RSA and EMC declined to answer questions for this story, but RSA said in a statement: "RSA always acts in the best interest of its customers and under no circumstances does RSA design or enable any back doors in our products. Decisions about the features and functionality of RSA products are our own."
The NSA declined to comment.
The RSA deal shows one way the NSA carried out what Snowden's documents describe as a key strategy for enhancing surveillance: the systematic erosion of security tools. NSA documents released in recent months called for using "commercial relationships" to advance that goal, but did not name any security companies as collaborators.
The NSA came under attack this week in a landmark report from a White House panel appointed to review U.S. surveillance policy. The panel noted that "encryption is an essential basis for trust on the Internet," and called for a halt to any NSA efforts to undermine it.
Most of the dozen current and former RSA employees interviewed said that the company erred in agreeing to such a contract, and many cited RSA's corporate evolution away from pure cryptography products as one of the reasons it occurred.
But several said that RSA also was misled by government officials, who portrayed the formula as a secure technological advance.
"They did not show their true hand," one person briefed on the deal said of the NSA, asserting that government officials did not let on that they knew how to break the encryption.
STORIED HISTORY
 View gallery    A National Security Agency (NSA) data gathering facility is seen in Bluffdale, about 25 miles (40 km …
Started by MIT professors in the 1970s and led for years by ex-Marine Jim Bidzos, RSA and its core algorithm were both named for the last initials of the three founders, who revolutionized cryptography. Little known to the public, RSA's encryption tools have been licensed by most large technology companies, which in turn use them to protect computers used by hundreds of millions of people.
At the core of RSA's products was a technology known as public key cryptography. Instead of using the same key for encoding and then decoding a message, there are two keys related to each other mathematically. The first, publicly available key is used to encode a message for someone, who then uses a second, private key to reveal it.
From RSA's earliest days, the U.S. intelligence establishment worried it would not be able to crack well-engineered public key cryptography. Martin Hellman, a former Stanford researcher who led the team that first invented the technique, said NSA experts tried to talk him and others into believing that the keys did not have to be as large as they The stakes rose when more technology companies adopted RSA's methods and Internet use began to soar. The Clinton administration embraced the Clipper Chip, envisioned as a mandatory component in phones and computers to enable officials to overcome encryption with a warrant.
RSA led a fierce public campaign against the effort, distributing posters with a foundering sailing ship and the words "Sink Clipper!"
A key argument against the chip was that overseas buyers would shun U.S. technology products if they were ready-made for spying. Some companies say that is just what has happened in the wake of the Snowden The White House abandoned the Clipper Chip and instead relied on export controls to prevent the best cryptography from crossing U.S. borders. RSA once again rallied the industry, and it set up an Australian division that could ship what it wanted.
"We became the tip of the spear, so to speak, in this fight against government efforts," Bidzos recalled in an oral history.
RSA EVOLVES
RSA and others claimed victory when export restrictions relaxed.
But the NSA was determined to read what it wanted, and the quest gained urgency after the September 11, 2001 attacks.
RSA, meanwhile, was changing. Bidzos stepped down as CEO in 1999 to concentrate on VeriSign, a security certificate company that had been spun out of RSA. The elite lab Bidzos had founded in Silicon Valley moved east to Massachusetts, and many top engineers left the company, several former employees said.
And the BSafe toolkit was becoming a much smaller part of the company. By 2005, BSafe and other tools for developers brought in just $27.5 million of RSA's revenue, less than 9% of the $310 million total.
"When I joined there were 10 people in the labs, and we were fighting the NSA," said Victor Chan, who rose to lead engineering and the Australian operation before he left in 2005. "It became a very different company later on."
By the first half of 2006, RSA was among the many technology companies seeing the U.S. government as a partner against overseas hackers.
New RSA Chief Executive Art Coviello and his team still wanted to be seen as part of the technological vanguard, former employees say, and the NSA had just the right pitch. Coviello declined an interview An algorithm called Dual Elliptic Curve, developed inside the agency, was on the road to approval by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology as one of four acceptable methods for generating random numbers. NIST's blessing is required for many products sold to the government and often sets a broader de facto standard.
RSA adopted the algorithm even before NIST approved it. The NSA then cited the early use of Dual Elliptic Curve inside the government to argue successfully for NIST approval, according to an official familiar with the proceedings.
RSA's contract made Dual Elliptic Curve the default option for producing random numbers in the RSA toolkit. No alarms were raised, former employees said, because the deal was handled by business leaders rather than pure technologists.
"The labs group had played a very intricate role at BSafe, and they were basically gone," said labs veteran Michael Wenocur, who left in 1999.
Within a year, major questions were raised about Dual Elliptic Curve. Cryptography authority Bruce Schneier wrote that the weaknesses in the formula "can only be described as a back door."
After reports of the back door in September, RSA urged its customers to stop using the Dual Elliptic Curve number generator.
But unlike the Clipper Chip fight two decades ago, the company is saying little in public, and it declined to discuss how the NSA entanglements have affected its relationships with customers.
The White House, meanwhile, says it will consider this week's panel recommendation that any efforts to subvert cryptography be abandoned.

Privacy Advocate Exposes High-Tech NSA Spy Gadgets Monday, 30 Dec 2013 03:43 PM
Share: A well-known privacy advocate has given the public an unusually explicit peek into the intelligence world's tool box, pulling back the curtain on the National Security Agency's arsenal of high-tech spy gear.
Independent journalist and security expert Jacob Appelbaum on Monday told a hacker conference in Germany that the NSA could turn iPhones into eavesdropping tools and use radar wave devices to harvest electronic information from computer even if they weren't online.
Appelbaum told hundreds of computer experts gathered at Hamburg's Chaos Communications Conference that his revelations about the NSA's capabilities "are even worse than your worst nightmares."
"What I am going to show you today is wrist-slittingly depressing," he said.
Even though in the past six months there have been an unprecedented level of public scrutiny of the NSA and its methods, Appelbaum's claims — supported by what appeared to be internal NSA slideshows — still caused a stir.
One of the slides described how the NSA can plant malicious software onto Apple Inc.'s iPhone, giving American intelligence agents the ability to turn the popular smartphone into a pocket-sized spy.
Another slide showcased a futuristic-sounding device described as a "portable continuous wave generator," a remote controlled device which — when paired with tiny electronic implants — can bounce invisible waves of energy off keyboards and monitors to see what is being typed even if the target device isn't connected to the Internet.
A third slide showcased a piece of equipment called NIGHTSTAND, which can tamper with wireless Internet connections from up to 8 miles away.
An NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines said that she wasn't aware of Appelbaum's presentation, but that in general should would not comment on "alleged foreign intelligence activities."
"As we've said before:  NSA's focus is on targeting the communications of valid foreign intelligence targets — not on collecting and exploiting a class of communications or services that would sweep up communications that are not of bona fide foreign intelligence interest to the U.S. government."
The documents included in Appelbaum's presentation were first published by German magazine Der Spiegel Sunday and Monday.
Appelbaum and Der Spiegel have both played an important role in the disclosures of NSA leaker Edward Snowden, but neither has clarified whether the most recent set of slides came from Snowden.

    I think my 'counter-surveillance' was a factor, but not in the way most (relatively uninformed) people might think.  You see, upon my release in April 2000, I strongly suspected that the Feds had been engaging in corruption and illegal actions against me (Google 'Ryan Thomas Lund'; also, it's in the July 2003 re-filing of my lawsuit 'Revision 1.06'        ) and I publicly announced that I would be investigating the facts and would eventually file a lawsuit. Primarily, during the summer of 2000, I visited the last-registered-addresses of vehicles that had been used on Father's Day Sunday 1998 to surveill me when I drove to a relative's house to attend her birthday party.  I suspected that those vehicles had been acquired by the Feds, and that they WOULDN'T be found at their last registered address.  (I had the Oregon DMV database on CDROM).  Turns out, I was absolutely correct.   (see, for example, 
    )
    What I DIDN'T know (in April 2000) was that since June 1999, the Feds had been faking an appeal in the 9th Circuit court of appeals (case 99-30210).  Quite literally, the appeal was initiated, and from the record it would have appeared that I was trying to handle the appeal myself.  But nobody told me about that appeal, and in fact at least a couple dozen pieces of legal mail that should have come to me at (first) Seatac FDC jail, and subsequently Phoenix FCI prison, were stolen (never delivered) by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) staff.  Further, I knew nothing of the law at that time.   (Note:  This version of the lawsuit was finalized under trying circumstances just days after I had first read the docket for appeal case 99-30210, so I couldn't write in detail about that fake appeal.  Subsequent amendments (around September 2004, as I recall) were far more detailed in my accusations.)
  The number of Federal felonies that were committed against me must have been immense.  Why they initiated, and kept secret, this fake appeal case, I still do not know.  But _THEY_ KNEW what they had done.  And, in about April 2000, I wrote a letter to the Ninth Circuit (still entirely unaware of case 99-30210) asking for an appeal in the underlying probation-revocation case.  (97-5270).  (I had been told by a 'jailhouse lawyer' in about January 2000 that I had a right to an appeal of that case).  At the time, I didn't know that to get an appeal, I'd have had to ask for an appeal (send in a "Notice of Appeal" document) within 10 working days of the 'entry of judgment' on the case.  I hadn't done that, and by the rules they would have been able to refuse me that appeal.  EXCEPT that there was ALREADY an appeal going, 99-30210!   And my request for an appeal, coupled with my public statements that I suspected corruption, probably put a world of
 fear into those who had been committing those crimes against me.  They knew I was on their track, and they presumably were afraid that I would discover what they had done.
    What I think was done was this:  They assigned a corrupt lawyer, ostensibly to represent me, "Jonathan Solovy", after having RE-forged the docket for appeal 99-30210 (probably in May 2000).  Solovy's job, as I later derived, was to APPEAR to write and file that appeal.  He did, and he lost.  But he didn't send me a copy of the docket for that case.  Had he done so, or had he asked me one of one hundred questions ("I see you've been working on this appeal for 10 months!  What are your appeal issues...?) I would have been instantly alerted that I hadn't initiated that appeal in April 2000, as I thought I had.  Solovy's job was to conceal from me the corrupt nature of the events around appeal 99-30210, and he did so.  I found out the true nature of fake appeal 99-30210 about June 20, 2003, after I received a copy of the docket for that case from the clerks' office of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
The corrupt lawyer, Robert Leen, was assigned to me about November 21, 2000.  I learned early that he didn't intend to actually defend me.  I sent a letter to the (corrupt) judge Tanner about December 8, 2000, telling him that I had 'fired' Leen.  Tanner's response was to refuse to let me fire Leen.  At that point, I realized that I would be fighting not merely the prosecution, but also 'my' attorney and the judge.  I began learning the law, and put a lot of effort into self-written motions and objections.  I even filed a 'Notice of Interlocutory Appeal' in late March 2001, just before my 'trial', which divested jurisdiction from that court to proceed.  Naturally, they simply ignored this, Leen, prosecutor Robb London (who currently works as the Communications Director at Harvard Law School), and judge Tanner.    Much of this is described in my lawsuit.   Like I said, the level of corruption used against me was immense.

Since the issue was just raised about me needing a PGP key (presumably, for now, just for signing purposes), it occurred to me that the best way to get that key signed would be for me to attend a meeting of Cypherpunks.  Since many such meetings occur in the Bay Area (San Francisco and environs) I could come from Vancouver Washington (Just across the Columbia river from Portland) and attend an upcoming Cypherpunks meeting.  What I'd appreciate would be a local who could provide transportation (I don't do 'credit card' and they probably wouldn't rent a car to me if I did!), and possibly a place to stay for 2-3 days.  Does this sound like a plan?  I could bring my BOP (Bureau of Prisons) ID, smuggled out when I was released, and auction it off for bitcoins, to pay for my expenses.

From that article:
     Quantum cryptography can't be broken by factorisation. Could it one day replace standard cryptosystems?
 short distances it wouldn't be too hard to build a quantum key distribution network to encrypt data. Over longer distances, you would need quantum repeaters every 50 kilometres or so on the fibre-optic network, as it's difficult to maintain a quantum state over long distances. Even if they are cheap by then, it's a lot of investment.
=====end of quote=====
My fiber optic invention has a certain relevance here. A typical modern germania-doped-core (GeO2) silica optical fiber has a loss of about 0.19 decibels/kilometer (db/km).  Over 50 km, the loss is (50 km x 0.19 db/km) = 9.5 db, ignoring splice losses.  (A good splice has a loss of about 0.10 db.)  So, the quote above is indicating that above a loss of about 10 db, a quantum system is hard to maintain.  I have suggested in my patent application that isotope-modified fiber (where the Si-29 level is brought from nature's 4.67% (atom/atom) to 0.10 %, the loss might decrease by a factor of 10 to 20.  This means that the ultimate distance limit might increase to 50 x 10 = 500 km, to 50 x 20 = 1000 km.  That would be a major improvement if it works.
The reason that this new fiber would be necessary is this:  Ever since the invention of the EDFA (Erbium-doped fiber amplifier    ) in 1986, it has been used to amplify IR signals in the 1510-1560 nanometer band.  Using it and ordinary signals (not quantum signals) it is possible to go about 125 kilometers between amplifiers.  (In other words, that usage tolerates about 25 db of optical loss before an EDFA is necessary.)  However, apparently an EDFA cannot be used to amplify a quantum system.       Or, at least, not directly.

Okay, thank you for clarifying this matter.  I merely Google-searched for  'EDFA quantum entanglement' and found and cited this paper, and that only because it referred to the problem of trying to amplify quantum signals through an EDFA.  Myself, I am hoping that longer-key public-key cryptosystems will remain unsolved by quantum techniques, at least as long as it takes to get rid of governments.  After that, it probably won't matter.  As of now, it looks like things will go the way I'd like.

I am limited by the fact that I have only had a couple of classes which touched upon quantum physics (and 35 years ago, to boot), I wonder if there will be some limit to how far these quantum techniques can be used to factor huge numbers. (Speculation warning!)   A 1 centimeter difference in altitude in Earth's gravitational field results in about a 1 part in 10**18 time dilation.  Even if the atoms making up a quantum computer could be maintained  within 1 micron altitude, that would be a time dilation difference of 1 part in 10**22.   Could there be an effect which would allow the factorization of numbers up to, say, 22 digits long, but that would fail if the number was 301 digits long?  (equivalent to 1024 bits.)   Such a computer might be raised into earth orbit to take advantage of micro-gravity effects, but even that might only raise the limit by a few orders of magnitude, say 22+6 = 28.  Someone much more familiar with quantum mechanics
 should be able to shed light on this speculation.

@_subject: Exclusive: Secret contract tied NSA and security industry pioneer 
By Joseph Menn SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As a key part of a campaign to embed encryption software that it could crack into widely used computer products, the U.S. National Security Agency arranged a secret $10 million contract with RSA, one of the most influential firms in the computer security industry, Reuters has learned.
Documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden show that the NSA created and promulgated a flawed formula for generating random numbers to create a "back door" in encryption products, the New York Times reported in September. Reuters later reported that RSA became the most important distributor of that formula by rolling it into a software tool called Bsafe that is used to enhance security in personal computers and many other products.
Undisclosed until now was that RSA received $10 million in a deal that set the NSA formula as the preferred, or default, method for number generation in the BSafe software, according to two sources familiar with the contract. Although that sum might seem paltry, it represented more than a third of the revenue that the relevant division at RSA had taken in during the entire previous year, securities filings show.
The earlier disclosures of RSA's entanglement with the NSA already had shocked some in the close-knit world of computer security experts. The company had a long history of championing privacy and security, and it played a leading role in blocking a 1990s effort by the NSA to require a special chip to enable spying on a wide range of computer and communications products.
RSA, now a subsidiary of computer storage giant EMC Corp, urged customers to stop using the NSA formula after the Snowden disclosures revealed its weakness.
RSA and EMC declined to answer questions for this story, but RSA said in a statement: "RSA always acts in the best interest of its customers and under no circumstances does RSA design or enable any back doors in our products. Decisions about the features and functionality of RSA products are our own."
The NSA declined to comment.
The RSA deal shows one way the NSA carried out what Snowden's documents describe as a key strategy for enhancing surveillance: the systematic erosion of security tools. NSA documents released in recent months called for using "commercial relationships" to advance that goal, but did not name any security companies as collaborators.
The NSA came under attack this week in a landmark report from a White House panel appointed to review U.S. surveillance policy. The panel noted that "encryption is an essential basis for trust on the Internet," and called for a halt to any NSA efforts to undermine it.
Most of the dozen current and former RSA employees interviewed said that the company erred in agreeing to such a contract, and many cited RSA's corporate evolution away from pure cryptography products as one of the reasons it occurred.
But several said that RSA also was misled by government officials, who portrayed the formula as a secure technological advance.
"They did not show their true hand," one person briefed on the deal said of the NSA, asserting that government officials did not let on that they knew how to break the encryption.
STORIED HISTORY
 View gallery    A National Security Agency (NSA) data gathering facility is seen in Bluffdale, about 25 miles (40 km …
Started by MIT professors in the 1970s and led for years by ex-Marine Jim Bidzos, RSA and its core algorithm were both named for the last initials of the three founders, who revolutionized cryptography. Little known to the public, RSA's encryption tools have been licensed by most large technology companies, which in turn use them to protect computers used by hundreds of millions of people.
At the core of RSA's products was a technology known as public key cryptography. Instead of using the same key for encoding and then decoding a message, there are two keys related to each other mathematically. The first, publicly available key is used to encode a message for someone, who then uses a second, private key to reveal it.
From RSA's earliest days, the U.S. intelligence establishment worried it would not be able to crack well-engineered public key cryptography. Martin Hellman, a former Stanford researcher who led the team that first invented the technique, said NSA experts tried to talk him and others into believing that the keys did not have to be as large as they The stakes rose when more technology companies adopted RSA's methods and Internet use began to soar. The Clinton administration embraced the Clipper Chip, envisioned as a mandatory component in phones and computers to enable officials to overcome encryption with a warrant.
RSA led a fierce public campaign against the effort, distributing posters with a foundering sailing ship and the words "Sink Clipper!"
A key argument against the chip was that overseas buyers would shun U.S. technology products if they were ready-made for spying. Some companies say that is just what has happened in the wake of the Snowden The White House abandoned the Clipper Chip and instead relied on export controls to prevent the best cryptography from crossing U.S. borders. RSA once again rallied the industry, and it set up an Australian division that could ship what it wanted.
"We became the tip of the spear, so to speak, in this fight against government efforts," Bidzos recalled in an oral history.
RSA EVOLVES
RSA and others claimed victory when export restrictions relaxed.
But the NSA was determined to read what it wanted, and the quest gained urgency after the September 11, 2001 attacks.
RSA, meanwhile, was changing. Bidzos stepped down as CEO in 1999 to concentrate on VeriSign, a security certificate company that had been spun out of RSA. The elite lab Bidzos had founded in Silicon Valley moved east to Massachusetts, and many top engineers left the company, several former employees said.
And the BSafe toolkit was becoming a much smaller part of the company. By 2005, BSafe and other tools for developers brought in just $27.5 million of RSA's revenue, less than 9% of the $310 million total.
"When I joined there were 10 people in the labs, and we were fighting the NSA," said Victor Chan, who rose to lead engineering and the Australian operation before he left in 2005. "It became a very different company later on."
By the first half of 2006, RSA was among the many technology companies seeing the U.S. government as a partner against overseas hackers.
New RSA Chief Executive Art Coviello and his team still wanted to be seen as part of the technological vanguard, former employees say, and the NSA had just the right pitch. Coviello declined an interview An algorithm called Dual Elliptic Curve, developed inside the agency, was on the road to approval by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology as one of four acceptable methods for generating random numbers. NIST's blessing is required for many products sold to the government and often sets a broader de facto standard.
RSA adopted the algorithm even before NIST approved it. The NSA then cited the early use of Dual Elliptic Curve inside the government to argue successfully for NIST approval, according to an official familiar with the proceedings.
RSA's contract made Dual Elliptic Curve the default option for producing random numbers in the RSA toolkit. No alarms were raised, former employees said, because the deal was handled by business leaders rather than pure technologists.
"The labs group had played a very intricate role at BSafe, and they were basically gone," said labs veteran Michael Wenocur, who left in 1999.
Within a year, major questions were raised about Dual Elliptic Curve. Cryptography authority Bruce Schneier wrote that the weaknesses in the formula "can only be described as a back door."
After reports of the back door in September, RSA urged its customers to stop using the Dual Elliptic Curve number generator.
But unlike the Clipper Chip fight two decades ago, the company is saying little in public, and it declined to discuss how the NSA entanglements have affected its relationships with customers.
The White House, meanwhile, says it will consider this week's panel recommendation that any efforts to subvert cryptography be abandoned.

Privacy Advocate Exposes High-Tech NSA Spy Gadgets Monday, 30 Dec 2013 03:43 PM
Share: A well-known privacy advocate has given the public an unusually explicit peek into the intelligence world's tool box, pulling back the curtain on the National Security Agency's arsenal of high-tech spy gear.
Independent journalist and security expert Jacob Appelbaum on Monday told a hacker conference in Germany that the NSA could turn iPhones into eavesdropping tools and use radar wave devices to harvest electronic information from computer even if they weren't online.
Appelbaum told hundreds of computer experts gathered at Hamburg's Chaos Communications Conference that his revelations about the NSA's capabilities "are even worse than your worst nightmares."
"What I am going to show you today is wrist-slittingly depressing," he said.
Even though in the past six months there have been an unprecedented level of public scrutiny of the NSA and its methods, Appelbaum's claims — supported by what appeared to be internal NSA slideshows — still caused a stir.
One of the slides described how the NSA can plant malicious software onto Apple Inc.'s iPhone, giving American intelligence agents the ability to turn the popular smartphone into a pocket-sized spy.
Another slide showcased a futuristic-sounding device described as a "portable continuous wave generator," a remote controlled device which — when paired with tiny electronic implants — can bounce invisible waves of energy off keyboards and monitors to see what is being typed even if the target device isn't connected to the Internet.
A third slide showcased a piece of equipment called NIGHTSTAND, which can tamper with wireless Internet connections from up to 8 miles away.
An NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines said that she wasn't aware of Appelbaum's presentation, but that in general should would not comment on "alleged foreign intelligence activities."
"As we've said before:  NSA's focus is on targeting the communications of valid foreign intelligence targets — not on collecting and exploiting a class of communications or services that would sweep up communications that are not of bona fide foreign intelligence interest to the U.S. government."
The documents included in Appelbaum's presentation were first published by German magazine Der Spiegel Sunday and Monday.
Appelbaum and Der Spiegel have both played an important role in the disclosures of NSA leaker Edward Snowden, but neither has clarified whether the most recent set of slides came from Snowden.

    I think my 'counter-surveillance' was a factor, but not in the way most (relatively uninformed) people might think.  You see, upon my release in April 2000, I strongly suspected that the Feds had been engaging in corruption and illegal actions against me (Google 'Ryan Thomas Lund'; also, it's in the July 2003 re-filing of my lawsuit 'Revision 1.06'        ) and I publicly announced that I would be investigating the facts and would eventually file a lawsuit. Primarily, during the summer of 2000, I visited the last-registered-addresses of vehicles that had been used on Father's Day Sunday 1998 to surveill me when I drove to a relative's house to attend her birthday party.  I suspected that those vehicles had been acquired by the Feds, and that they WOULDN'T be found at their last registered address.  (I had the Oregon DMV database on CDROM).  Turns out, I was absolutely correct.   (see, for example,

    What I DIDN'T know (in April 2000) was that since June 1999, the Feds had been faking an appeal in the 9th Circuit court of appeals (case 99-30210).  Quite literally, the appeal was initiated, and from the record it would have appeared that I was trying to handle the appeal myself.  But nobody told me about that appeal, and in fact at least a couple dozen pieces of legal mail that should have come to me at (first) Seatac FDC jail, and subsequently Phoenix FCI prison, were stolen (never delivered) by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) staff.  Further, I knew nothing of the law at that time.   (Note:  This version of the lawsuit was finalized under trying circumstances just days after I had first read the docket for appeal case 99-30210, so I couldn't write in detail about that fake appeal.  Subsequent amendments (around September 2004, as I recall) were far more detailed in my accusations.)
  The number of Federal felonies that were committed against me must have been immense.  Why they initiated, and kept secret, this fake appeal case, I still do not know.  But _THEY_ KNEW what they had done.  And, in about April 2000, I wrote a letter to the Ninth Circuit (still entirely unaware of case 99-30210) asking for an appeal in the underlying probation-revocation case.  (97-5270).  (I had been told by a 'jailhouse lawyer' in about January 2000 that I had a right to an appeal of that case).  At the time, I didn't know that to get an appeal, I'd have had to ask for an appeal (send in a "Notice of Appeal" document) within 10 working days of the 'entry of judgment' on the case.  I hadn't done that, and by the rules they would have been able to refuse me that appeal.  EXCEPT that there was ALREADY an appeal going, 99-30210!   And my request for an appeal, coupled with my public statements that I suspected corruption, probably put a world of
 fear into those who had been committing those crimes against me.  They knew I was on their track, and they presumably were afraid that I would discover what they had done.
    What I think was done was this:  They assigned a corrupt lawyer, ostensibly to represent me, "Jonathan Solovy", after having RE-forged the docket for appeal 99-30210 (probably in May 2000).  Solovy's job, as I later derived, was to APPEAR to write and file that appeal.  He did, and he lost.  But he didn't send me a copy of the docket for that case.  Had he done so, or had he asked me one of one hundred questions ("I see you've been working on this appeal for 10 months!  What are your appeal issues...?) I would have been instantly alerted that I hadn't initiated that appeal in April 2000, as I thought I had.  Solovy's job was to conceal from me the corrupt nature of the events around appeal 99-30210, and he did so.  I found out the true nature of fake appeal 99-30210 about June 20, 2003, after I received a copy of the docket for that case from the clerks' office of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
The corrupt lawyer, Robert Leen, was assigned to me about November 21, 2000.  I learned early that he didn't intend to actually defend me.  I sent a letter to the (corrupt) judge Tanner about December 8, 2000, telling him that I had 'fired' Leen.  Tanner's response was to refuse to let me fire Leen.  At that point, I realized that I would be fighting not merely the prosecution, but also 'my' attorney and the judge.  I began learning the law, and put a lot of effort into self-written motions and objections.  I even filed a 'Notice of Interlocutory Appeal' in late March 2001, just before my 'trial', which divested jurisdiction from that court to proceed.  Naturally, they simply ignored this, Leen, prosecutor Robb London (who currently works as the Communications Director at Harvard Law School), and judge Tanner.    Much of this is described in my lawsuit.   Like I said, the level of corruption used against me was immense.

I am an alum of MIT (Class of 1980; Chemistry).  I've just read the Wikipedia article on Aaron Swartz, and I am very sympathetic to him.   I wish I'd been aware of his situation while he was alive; I might have been able to help, and would have tried to do so.

@_subject: Jim Bell comes to Cypherpunks? 
Since the issue was just raised about me needing a PGP key (presumably, for now, just for signing purposes), it occurred to me that the best way to get that key signed would be for me to attend a meeting of Cypherpunks.  Since many such meetings occur in the Bay Area (San Francisco and environs) I could come from Vancouver Washington (Just across the Columbia river from Portland) and attend an upcoming Cypherpunks meeting.  What I'd appreciate would be a local who could provide transportation (I don't do 'credit card' and they probably wouldn't rent a car to me if I did!), and possibly a place to stay for 2-3 days.  Does this sound like a plan?  I could bring my BOP (Bureau of Prisons) ID, smuggled out when I was released, and auction it off for bitcoins, to pay for my expenses. (It's sure to be a collector's item someday!)

"James A. Donald"
 didn't commit any real crime so he never was, or pretended
My understanding (from reading the Wikipedia article on Swartz an hour ago) was that he accessed "PACER" information.   (     )    The information in PACER (which I have used a few times before, for example to access the docket for fake, forged, fraudulent "appeal" case 99-30210) is simply Federal court case files.  (Dockets; filings).  This material is legally in the public domain:  It is not even copyrighted.  I don't know if Swartz did anything 'illegal' to get into the computer that had the information, but I doubt that.
   Incidentally, the charge for PACER documents is now $0.10 per page, but if you run up a charge of less than $15.00 in a calendar quarter, there is no charge.  (In other words, less than 150 pages downloaded are free)
