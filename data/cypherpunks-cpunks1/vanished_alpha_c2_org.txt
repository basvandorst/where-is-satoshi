@_subject: Cookies anyone? 
While rummaging around in my cookie jar, I found this message--along with some cookies.
:Netscape HTTP Cookie File
:# :# This is a generated file!  Do not edit.
Rather than bring down my system by experimenting, I thought I'd ask the list, "What happens if I delete this file?" and "What happens if I delete (edit) the cookies?"
This may have been discussed before, but until now I never checked for cookies.
Thanks for your consideration of this matter.
