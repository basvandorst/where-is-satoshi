@_subject: Detweiler's SQUISH broadcast: can remailers filter out addressee? 
I'm not familiar with anonymous remailer internals.  Would it be cheap
in terms of hack-time to add the capability for an anonymous remailer
to maintain a list of addresses (or address regexp's) which do not
wish to receive anonymous remailed messages?
That way, if Detweiler is sending unwanted msgs to say,
"chess-fans at foo.bar.com" via an anonymous remailer, and the readers of
chess-fans complained to the (hopefully responsive) remailer operator,
the remailer operator could add the "chess-fans" address to a "don't-
remail-to-these-folks" list so that the nice readers of chess-fans can
read mail in peace.
However, if the "Don't-mail-to-these-folks" list gets too long, it
would probably degrade remailer performance... sigh.  (remailer authors:
is this a correct assumption?)
(Perhaps the "don't-mail" addresses could be tagged with amount of time
somebody last attempted them;  addresses that no one's attempted to
hit in say, a year, could be expired.)

Hello, Larry.
Isn't it amazing?  You can spend all day typing & editing posts; it
only takes me about 1.5 seconds to hit the "delete" key.  (Sort of
like the way a $200,000 disposable anti-air missile can take out a
$30,000,000 jet fighter.)  It's probably the best filter in the world:
knows exactly what I do and don't want to read.  Plus, when you do
occassionally come up with a useful post, such as the one I'm replying
to, I can save it.

"Wacos In Cyberspace:  Hear, hear!"

@_subject: Cyberspace is by nature crime-free 
The major difference between cyberspace and the world of brick houses
    is that no _physical_ crime is possible
Right on.  With the exception of fraud (the danger of which is
lessened by the use of appropriate cryptographic protocols in your
business transactions), cyberspace is essentially crime free.
Mind y'all, when I said "Wacos in Cyberspace: Hear, hear!"  I thinking
of the positive aspects of the former Branch Davidian community: they
were independent, effectively sovereign, and capable and willing to
defend themselves.  (Vernor Vinge's "The Ungoverned"[1] is one of my
favorite stories.)
I *am* *not* fond of their plethora of bad aspects: that they were
religious-fanatic leader-following probably-child-abusing collectivist
loonies with barely a gram of rational grey matter amongst the lot of
    What's the FBI going to do? Jail people for _talking_ ... ?
I'm sure they'd like to.  It would certainly make things more... *orderly*.
"You have been found guilty of Thoughtcrime..."
Actually, in a recent case a person was threatened with jail for
exercising freedom of expression.  Underground comix artist named Mike
Diana recently was found guilty of distributing pornography; he
self-published a xeroxed zine containing his own rather raw artwork.
As part of his sentence, the judge ordered him to *never draw this
kind of stuff again*!.  Seriously: the judge ordered that the guy's
parole officer was to *make unannounced checks of the guy's house
periodically to make sure he wasn't drawing anything pornographic*!
Even if he wasn't publishing it!  [Check around on Usenet for more
details; I can't remember which newsgroups I saw this in.]
ObCrypto: Perhaps Diana could begin drawing on a Mac, and use Stego
to hide his stuff.  "Sure, officer, wanna see some of the landscapes
I've been working on?"

[1] Vernor Vinge's short story "The Ungoverned" is a great depiction of
anarchocapitalism in action.  Look for it in either of his collections
"Across Realtime" and "True Names and Other Dangers", both from Baen
Books, in paperback.

@_subject: Cyberspace is by nature crime-free [?] 
I have to disagree with this, especially the title 'is by nature'.
   Cyberspace as a communications forum still presents many opportunities
   for crime as are present in physical and related communications media.
Good points, I wasn't thinking far enough.  The examples you cite can
be classified as follows:
- Breaking and entering:  Yes, an obvious "cyberspace crime" which I
  unthinkingly missed.  Could perhaps be considered fraud: If you give a
  username/password to gain access, you are falsely asserting that
  you're an authorized user of that username.
- Vilification/slander/libel: Also possibly can be considered as
  fraud?  You're asserting things that are false, and people who rely on
  your false information will make bad decisions.
- Discrimination:  I don't think this should be a crime.    The interactions/commerce/associations that people engage in should
  be freely assented to by all parties, even if they have really
  stupid reasons for deciding to refuse.
- Sedition:  Not a crime in my book... Yay, Sedition!
- Inciting violence:  Perhaps even can be covered by fraud, if you
  stretch it hard enough:  You give people false information ("Such and
  such ethnic group are polluting our precious bodily fluids and
  should be killed") which they then rely on to make bad choices
  regarding the perpertration of violence.  Of course, the actual
  physical committing of violence is a much more serious crime.
- Transferring funds, tax evasion:  Also not a crime in my book.
  Yay Tax Evasion!
- Illegal business activity, false advertising:  False advertising
  is an instance of fraud.  I'm not sure what you mean by
  "illegal business activity."
- Contempt of court:  Hm.  Refusing to provide your decryption
  key to the judge...  Not really a crime *of* cyberspace; more
  akin to a crime of the courtroom.
- Copyright infringment:  Ah, theft of Intellectual Property.
  A tough nut in these modern times.  If you had to forge authorization
  information to get the material, then it would be fraud in the same
  sense as an unauthorized login:  You are fraudulently asserting
  that you are a paying customer.  But if the material is just lying
  around unprotected for you to pick up?  Hm...

P.S. Larry, if you're still lurking around here:  the "Yay Sedition!" and
"Yay Tax Evasion!" are especially for *yoooouuu*.
