Tell me about it. Im on AOL. WHO CARESSSSSSS if ya get one MAYBE two pieces
of  mail you take LESS than a second to delete them both with the handy
delete key. These people are wasting more time complaining about it than they
will ever do actually deleting it.

 Yes, a bunch of them:
 1. Get a life. Learn to delete unwanted e-mail. Get a real shell account.
 2. Ask AOL to let its users decide what e-mail to reject automatically (like
 procmail). They've been promising this capability by the end of September.
 Then you can set up your account to get no more e-mail from netfree.

Typical asshole response. I must thank chuck at nova..etc. for his TRULY helpful
But you........get a real shell account?? I do thank you. netcom and a school
system. I can delete unwanted mail. But maybe I LIKE to yell at people who
spam me. And ive never received mail from netfree before..nor since... thats
NOT my problem. Learn to comprehend what pthers write. I wanted to know what
I can do about getting in coontact with them. It is in my opinion not right
to forge email addresses...people dont do it when the send me us postal mail

<< .why do Telco
 people and the government blame us hackers for costing them billions of
 a year to fix the security holes that they have??? >>
 Considering there is a LARGE workload on the employees as it is.. they dont
need more work suddenly that is unneeded. Basically EVERY system has some
kinds of security holes. If noone knows about them.. then it isnt a problem.
If someone is exploiting them and using money from the company illegaly (free
phone service) .. even though it may only be 5 of you doing it.. it has a
LARGE potential to become globally exploited by tons of people. So.. they
have to invest time and money to research the hole and fix it. Thats why.
