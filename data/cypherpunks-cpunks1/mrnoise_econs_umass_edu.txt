@_subject: PGP: suggestions from the trench 
While I agree that keys of greater lengths out to be made available for
those fortunate enough to possess platforms powerful enough to use them,
your choice of words--'TOY GRADE'--is, perhaps, unfortunate.  Every user
of PGP has different reasons for needing/wanting encryption, & not all users
need the sort of protection that can withstand a determined attack mustered
by cryptographic experts.  Some users, frankly, just don't like people
snooping into their private mail, & therefore use PGP encryption as an
'envelope'.  Sure, the 'envelope' can be 'steamed open', but it's not likely
to be worth the trouble if you have no major secrets to conceal...

Hear, hear!  For cryin' out loud, Fido 'Snooze' accepts *everything* they're

@_subject: anon email/caller id 
Phil Karn's anology between anonymous e-mail & caller i.d. gets it
right, I think.  If you don't want to read it, don't, just as you
may block calls without caller i.d.  There are two concerns I'd like to
see addressed, though:  first, what about those who use anon email to
get away with behavior that wastes net resources?  When the identity of
the poster is know, they can be 'disciplined' by other net.citizens (call
it frontier justice if you like...).  second, from the opposite end, won't
the availability of caller i.d. mean that it will become more diffuclt to
engage in truly anonymous conversations over the telephone network, as
revealing one's identity becomes the norm?
As to the first objection, I suppose we could continue to rely on the
site administrators (& remailer admins) to discipline the offenders.  After
all, the sites are still subject to the same discipline we can inflict on
the individual poster if known.  As to the second, I suppose we can always
observe that those who won't accept our anonymous call aren't worth talking
to in the first place, but that evades the question IMHO.  Also, having the
capability in the phone system means someone can still abuse it without our
I would suggest another solution to this dilemma:  'handles'.  Having a
semi-secret identity means having control over your Real Life exposure to
risk, whiel still allowing those you come in contact with to indentify you--
& ignore you if they wish with minimal trouble.  It also means that you can
set different levels of security:  anyone who cares to can find out who Mr.
Noise is, but how many of you know the *other* 'real mes'?
Well, just some rambling thoughts at lunchtime as a way of saying hello to
all of you on this list, since I just joined a week ago & didn't want to
'lurk'.  :-)  Have an anonymous day!

@_subject: RSA patent! 
There are two things wrong with this objection that I can see:
(1)  What is relevant is whether the public derives a NET (no pun intended!)
benefit from the patent system, not whether it has benefittted in this
particular case.  We can't decide, ex post, whether to extend patent protection
to something that is patentable under the law, else the law will cease to provide the incentives that encourage innovation.
(2)  We may have, in fact, benefitted.  The question is whether anyone would have come up with the algorithim & given it away if it weren't for the possibility
of making some money off of it.  Maybe they would have;  it *is* certain that in a few years (how many, exactly?  anyone know?) the patent will expire, & we
will enjoy the full use of the algorithm free of patent restrictions, right?

Maybe...but what about 'crisis hotlines' and number for 'anonymous referrals'?
The average person is probably unaware that the folks at the 800 number they're
calling can get their number...

@_subject: Phil Zimmerman on the Radio 
ACK!  My mailbox has been so backlogged that I read this message a month late!
*Did* anyone tape the show?  I'd really like a copy...maybe to replay on the
radio at WCNI (New London, 91.1) if it's really good (if that's o.k....?)...
If someone has a tape, please let me know at mrnoise at econs.umass.edu, or if
you're feeling both ambitious & altruistic, please mail a copy to me at P.O.
Box 109, Bozrah, CT...I'll mail you back $$ for the tape & postage.  Thanks in
advance for any help on this one...

@_subject: The New Mykotronix phones... 
Please forgive me for replying to a message that's already a month old,
but I was in the process of wading through the messages that have swamped my mailbox while I was doing end-of-the-semester stuff & didn't
come across any replies...so just a brief note or two before I
submerge again to study for my last Ph.D. comprehensive:
This is a good, creative response to fascist technology, but I wonder if I'm
the only one on this list who's noticed a parallel between the government's
attitude toward small arms & its attitude approach to cryptography?  (After
all, cryptographic technology *is* dealt with as a 'munition' in the export
laws, right?)  While this means that many of the same defenses apply to crypto as to arms--as in "When codes are outlawed, only outlaws will have
codes," a tagline I made up when I first started using PGP--it also means that
we can expect the government (& other opponents) to use similar tactics in
trying to deny us our right to privacy.
So how might the government respond if we were to use the tactic described
above?  Well, just consider what they would do if you loaned someone your
handgun & they committed a crime with it:  they hold you responsible as well.
If we allow a system of key registry to be instituted in any form, I think we
can expect the same boneheaded legislation restricting our freedom to use
cryptography as is currently inflicted on would-be gun owners.  If nothing
else, "key permits" would represent a new source of revenue for the tax-crazed
Clinton administration & governors across the fruited plains!  Consider that,
in order to obtain local & state permits to carry a handgun in my home state of
Connecticut it costs a total of $50 for the first year alone & $25 per year to
renew the liscence (it may cost even more in other towns, I don't know)!  &
then there's the paperwork, & the wait, &....

@_subject: WER #79 
Having received my copy of the latest Whole Earth Review yesterday, I
expected to see a pile of messages about the article by Kevin Kelly on
"Cypherpunks, E-Money, & Technologies of Disconnection"...but maybe,
like me, you've all been too busy to read the article all the way through.
Anyway, I thought those of you who don't subscribe would appreciate a mention of the article so you could run right out & buy the mag.  There's
also some good sci-fi stuff (they give it some kind of fancy name, you
know WER...) by Kelly & Brian Eno.  & the cover is by R. Crumb!
Well, anyway, it seems Mr. Kelly has spent some time talking to list
member (guru?) Tim May, Phil Zimmerman, & a bunch of other cypherpunk
folk, so how about some reactions to the article from those he talked to?
...& is it me, or is the WER/WELL/cypherpunks/Wired/EFF/etc. crowd starting
to get just a *little* inbred?  (In a nice way, of course...)  I feel as
though Kelly, Sterling, Brand, Levy, et al. are my best buddies & I don't
think we've ever exchanged e-mail (well, once or twice maybe), they just
keep popping up everywhere I turn.  Heck, I may even have to write R.U.Sirius
into my will, he feels like such an old pal...
