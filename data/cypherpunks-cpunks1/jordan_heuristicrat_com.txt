At the risk of sounding like Perry, if you think that the major card
issuers "don't care" about cutting (or eliminating) fraud, you're not
talking to the right people.  Fraud eats away a big chunk of revenue
and can quite significantly affect competitiveness in a market with
thin margins.

Just a note for those who aren't aware, Business Wire is a pay-per-use
"news release" service.  That is, RSA wrote the contents of what Bob
(Hi!) posted.
The clue is at the bottom of the "story":
This is not to say anything pro or con about the content of the press
release; just that it wasn't written by a third party.
