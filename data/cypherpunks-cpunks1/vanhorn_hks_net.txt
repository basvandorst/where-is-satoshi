I consider it unlikely in the extreme that this passed without Gingrich's
sanction.  So I guess the Newt's much-publicized opposition to the Exon
amendment was just a show.

@_subject: DejaNews all over again--a URL for Usenet Searching 
A small point of information.  I work for Architext, the company that provides
the excite service.  We only keep the last two weeks of USENET news around,
and don't keep any archives going further back than that.  USENET is just too
damn huge for us to go to the trouble of keeping comprehensive archives around
without good evidence of demand for it among our target audience.

And while you're at it, make sure you point out what the acronym CDA
really means:
  Communications Disempowerment Act.

Best-selling author Harry Browne fits the bill.  He's seeking the Libertarian
Party nomination.

Tim May is the first person I've ever encountered who calls himself a
libertarian and yet thinks dropping the Bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
was justified.  I think that, from a consistent libertarian perspective,
using the Bomb was equivalent to taking out a Mafia chieftain by napalming
the neighborhood in which he lived.  Perhaps the bad guy being targetted was
a killer who deserved to die, but that doesn't justify snuffing his neighbors.
