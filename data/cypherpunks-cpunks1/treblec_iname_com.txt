@_subject: CDR: Cryptonomicon question... 
I realise Cryptonomicon (by Neal Stephenson) was a thread middle of last year, and I don't intend to revisit old topics. But this question was posed to me, and I can't find the answer anywhere. And it's as simple as this... What is Avi's surname??? Web searches came up blank, I've re-read the book, and I couldn't see anything in the old discussion thread.
Don't post responses (not worth the disk space on CH), but I would appreciate an email (and a page reference if possible) before it drives me nuts!!!
Much appreciated
