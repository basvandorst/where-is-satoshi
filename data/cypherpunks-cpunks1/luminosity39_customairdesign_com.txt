@_subject: Feeling ill? We may make you feel better very swiftly. 
i told cate about st. patrick's day and ireland- she has a lot of irish ancestors through me. she's amazing. we are happily enjoying being able to play outside again. back in a few days
the best part of dinner was the irish soda bread- it was so so good, and it's really easy to make. in a tiny town in idaho
i want those red boots and that coat. with the sun streaming in
and totally not what you are supposed to be eating
it was super delicious. the ms craft dept was featured in an article, and their personal crafting projects were shown. i recommend rounding your troops for a similar conversation, and a brainstorm session for how to prepare for what lies ahead. just sayin.
she'll be here friday and saturday april 3rd and 4th, and she'll be taking appointments for all day/ night both days at my house. when she does these weekends she fills up really fast so don't wait- if you need color and/or cut and/or face waxing at very reasonable prices email her promptly and she'll get you booked and give you directions. where you can get great steak and shrimp
i am excited about my new running shoes.
corned beef is cheap meat, a head of cabbage is less than 50 cents, and i bet you have all the ingredients for the bread in your cupboard. you should make this meal tonight!
last minute trip to idaho to see my sister- so much better than home blogging!
i am determined to get the house clean so i can relax and sew tomorrow.
good news!
