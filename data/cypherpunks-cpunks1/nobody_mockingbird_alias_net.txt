I'd use: Linux + ssh + dosemu
You can run your text-based messy-dos programs remotely; I do it all the
If your work computer is not on a tcp/ip network already, then you'll need
to use slip/ppp over the modem, which isn't hard.  Just read the dip manual
and/or pppd man page, it tells you how to set up a slip/ppp account.  Ssh
takes care of all the encryption for your logins and file transfers (scp).

Yep, you can mount encrypted files or partitions as filesystems. (sorta
like securedrive/securedevice for messydos.)  Nifty stuff...

How about getting the CyberCafes to accept ecash?  Just pull out your
Newton/HP48/PDA and point the IR beam at the cash register.  Now that's
an ecash application I'd like to see!!

@_subject: private key encryption program for you to hack at 
Look, newbie, there are many people here who would be happy to review your
algorithm, but playing silly games like you are doing isn't going to win
you any points.  Most of the people on this list don't even use messydos,
so an exe file without source is kinda pointless.  If you're serious about
writing a secure crypto application, then stop giving us the runaround and
get to the point.  That means either post source code, or a thorough
technical description of your algorithm.
