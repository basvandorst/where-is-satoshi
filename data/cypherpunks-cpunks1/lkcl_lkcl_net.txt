@_subject: [Freedombox-discuss] Debian GNU/Linux on tablet hardware 
[for the benefit of the freedombox list, cc'd here: a discussion is
taking place - again - on debian-arm about the cost and availability
of ARM-based systems.  a chipset has been found which meets eben's
criteria in mass-volume.  actually, is a whopping 25% _below_ eben's
expectations of $20, and is 40% lower than the raspberrypi price,
with, being a 1ghz Cortex A8 instead of a 700mhz ARM11, roughly 2 to
2.5x better performance.]

 i am in touch with such a "no-name" chinese tablet manufacturer. i
can negotiate one of those "into existence"... *if* people are willing
to commit - publicly so that i can refer the factory to the archives -
to buying some.
 let's work through the costs, and i'll ask the factory to confirm,
but it'll be roughly something like this:
 * the mass-production BOM of a 1ghz Cortex A8 system using the
chiprise aka bmorn aka allwinner SoC will be - literally - around the
$15 mark.
 * morphing the "Reference Board Design" into a "FreedomBox-like"
device will be about 10 days @ $150 per day (NOT $150 per hour, REALLY
$150 per day).
 * back-caclulating that cost to include it in to the first.. say...
100 units, that's $15 extra per unit.
 * scaling up on the BOM to 100-only quantities, you prooobbbably need
to add about 60% to 70%.
 * $15 * 1.7 = $25.50 plus $15 amortised over 100 units is $40.
 * add a reasonable profit margin - say 25% (that's *really* generous
btw), that's now $50.
 * $50 plus shipping, tax and a box, that's about $80 to get it into your hands.
 $80 is still a f*** of a lot lower than $125 *excluding* shipping for
a beagleboard.
 and, once it hits mass-production and goes world-wide, that $80
becomes about $35, and if you do a "Special FreedomBox Special Order"
of 100,000 units, that $35 becomes about $25 *including* shipping and
 so it's up to you, folks.  if you want to see something like this
happen, you have to say so.
 btw - if you want to take over negotiations with the factory, i am
quite happy to put anyone who wishes to take over in touch with the
factory.  i will give you their email address, you can talk directly
with them.
