Keep Out
                  The Journal of Electronic Privacy
     There is a well-established constitutional right to privacy in the United
States.  We have this right today because of the wisdom and forethought of our
founding fathers.
     That right is being threatened--usually not by would-be dictators or
demagogues, but by well-meaning people who are simply misguided.
     To counter that threat, I created Keep Out.
     Keep Out focuses on the practical side of cryptography, digital money,
anonymous remailers, and everything else that can increase privacy.  Rather
than discuss the obscure branches of mathematics that are the basis for these
technologies, Keep Out will discuss how to get these technologies, what they
can do, and how to use them.
     Stories in progress for the first issue include:
       *  A review of the different programs that claim to link PGP with
          off-line mail-readers
       *  A story on the breaking of RSA and what it really means in terms of
          the security of your messages
       *  An interview with Phil Zimmermann, including his thoughts on privacy
          in the digital age, export controls on cryptography, the copyright o
          RSA (the algorithm used in PGP), and information on his struggle wit
          US Customs over exporting PGP
       *  In our beginners' section, an explanation of how public-key
          encryption works, and how it can work for you
     In short, Keep Out focuses on who is taking your privacy away from you,
and what you can do to get it back.
     A one-year subscription (six issues) to Keep Out costs US $15.  Keep Out
can not accept credit-card orders, but checks and money orders payable to
"Keep Out" are welcome.
     The premier issue of Keep Out will reach newsstands everywhere August 1.
     The electronic version of Keep Out will be released after it is published
on paper.

rr> About "Keep Out": you might want to be more precise in your blurbs.  As
rr> things stand, I'm leery of trusting anything I might see in
rr> your journal.
rr> RSA is not broken, as far as I know.  If you have verifiable details that
rr> it has, that'll be quite a scoop.  If you meant to say "the _factoring_ of
rr> RSA-129," well, you should have said that instead.
My apologies to the net.  RSA is certainly not broken, and I was aware of that
when this press release was written.  My word choice was sloppy.  In the
article, the information comes from people I have interviewed who have direct,
first-hand knowledge of the effort--people like Arjen Lenstra, who wrote the
software that made the factoring possible.
rr> >        *  An interview with Phil Zimmermann, including his thoughts on
rr> privacy in the digital age, export controls on cryptography, the
rr> copyright on RSA (the algorithm used in PGP), and information on his
rr> struggle with US Customs over exporting PGP
rr> A publisher, of all people, really needs to understand what a copyright
rr> is.  Note that we cannot copyright ideas, only our expression of those
rr> ideas.  Referring to a copyright on "the algorithm used in PGP" is
rr> nonsense.  Instead, PKP holds licensing rights to a system _patent_ on
rr> using RSA to perform public key encryption.
Again, I used sloppy language.  And again, my apologies.
This is certainly not the last mistake I will make.  There will be errors in
Keep Out.  However, I will do my damndest to make sure Keep Out remains as
accurate and unbiased as it can be.
And when I make mistakes, I trust Cypherpunks to let me know about them, so I
don't repeat the mistakes.  It's a damn sure bet I won't be making these two
errors again!

Uu> Speaking of digital cash, many thanks to the author of the
 Uu> 'magic money' software.  I am in the process of integrating it
 Uu> with a local bulletin board, which should hopefully be available
 Uu> on the net sometime this summer.
Does anyone have any more information about this?  Sounds interesting, if I
knew what it was.

 Uu> I have always been skeptical of this observer-chip approach, because
 Uu> it wasn't clear that it was feasible to make a tamper-resistant chip
 Uu> economically, and because the specialized hardware that would be
 Uu> required would prevent the system from being used on widely-available
 Uu> PCs.  However, now we see that our military rulers apparently trust
 Uu> tamper-resistant technology well enough to put it into thousands of
 Uu> public hands, without fear that even one chip will be opened and read.
 Uu> Breaking an observer only lets you double-spend the coins it holds,
 Uu> while breaking Clipper allows you to permanently defeat the escrow
 Uu> provisions of the whole system.  So this suggests that the technology
 Uu> is adequate for observers.
I once asked my grandfather if he was sure he could take apart the tractor he
was working on.  His response?  "A man put it together."  Anything one man can
do, another can undo--the only variable is the degree of effort required.  I'm
sure we can make a tamper-resistant chip, but can we make a tamper-proof one?
Considering the determination and intelligence of some of the people involved,
I'm sure that a tamper-resistant chip would be compromised pretty quickly.
