@_subject: Correction to cryptome.org 
Are you a good contact person for the information on the Microsoft DRM patent (6,330,670) on cryptome.org?
The pages linked from  say that the authors of this patent (England, DeTreville, and Lampson) were identified by Newsweek as Palladium programmers.
I can reliably state that I (DeTreville) am not a Palladium programmer, and neither is Butler Lampson.
I believe that the Newsweek article was referring to a different patent. I'm sure that the Palladium participants jointly hold a significant number of important patents in the field of computer security.
