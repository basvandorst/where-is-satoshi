Partially agreed - a user doesn't have to know *how* it works, but must
have to take a positive step (eg, type in a password, answer "yes" to a
"are you really sure you want to do this" message, that sort of thing)
for it to be binding under most e-sig legislation. However, the law of
contract assumes every dotted i and crossed t is read and fully
understood to the full measure of the law. Enough people get caught out
this way each year (they find the contract they signed isn't what they
negotiated but (eg) binds them to a full term of service (say, two
years) when they wanted a three month trial...
There is a balance to be had here. it should be impossible for a random
user to walk up to their powered off pc, power it on, then sign a
document. It should be extremely difficult for a random user to walk up
to a pc that has been left logged on (but which hasn't been used to sign
documents for five minutes or so) and sign a document; it should be easy
for the user to sign a large number of documents in rapid succession,
without having to type in a complex password every single time. If this
involves remembering the password for a specified "idle" time, or using
a smartcard to auth (rather than a manual password or in addition) that
the user can remove when he takes a coffee break then fine - but
whatever you do must almost certainly use no other hardware than is
already fitted to the machine, so a usb dongle could be ok for a home
user but a credit-card style smartcard almost certainly won't be
(although if anyone knows a decent floppy-adaptor for smartcards, I
would love to know about it)

it would at least give us a chance to check the integrity of your post
(what a sig is for after all) and anyone faking your key on the servers
would have to prevent you ever seeing one of your own posts (so that you
can't check the signature yourself)
The Web-of-Trust model is mildly broken - all you can really say about
it is that it is better than the alternatives (X509 is not only badly
broken, but badly broken for the purpose of hierachical control and/or
In the current case, one reason to sign important posts is to establish
a pattern of ownership for posts, independent of real-world identity. If
I know that posts a,b & c sent from nym x are all signed, I will be
reasonably confident that key y is owned by the normal poster of nym x.
that I don't know who that is in meatspace is pretty irrelevant.
Where both systems break down is when trying to assert that key y is
tied to anything but an email address (or possibly a static IP). There
is little to bind a key to anything or anyone in the real world, unless
you meet in person, know each other reasonably well (if only via third
parties that can identify you both) and exchange fingerprints. in fact,
WoT is simply an attempt to automate this process offline, so that you
can be "introduced" to someone by a third party without all three of you
having to meet; you still have to make a value judgement based on how
sure you are about the third party's reliability and how confident they
seem about the identity of x - however in the real world, both of those
are vague, hard-to-define values and in the WoT they are rigid (you have
a choice of two levels of trust for an introducer, and no way to encode
how much third parties should rely on your identification)

Given the nature of this problem, perhaps a *better* solution would be to
work on getting the spec updated to include a "security-sensitive"
declaration for variables in c/c++? such variables could be held in such a
way that they (where the os permits)
a) are never swapped to disk
b) are automagically wiped with three passes of pseudo-random data when
c) are in a "security data" area of memory that can't be accessed by
programs not owning the data there
d) are register variables when possible (for security, not speed)
the "always wipe when the variable is discarded" functionality shouldn't be
that hard to impliment, and would remove the only real reason we don't want
optimisation for those variables - that we want to be able to blank them.

Its a nice idea, but unfortunately gets easily bitten by the usual
networking bugbears
1. large wifi networks start to hit scaling problems - they start to need
routers and name services that are relatively expensive, and ip address
ranges start to become a scarce resource.
2. no matter how large the new network becomes, it still needs a link to the
"old" network; almost all ISPs frown on use of home connections for sharing
more than just the owner's machines, and many consider using even unmetered
in a manner they didn't provision for (ie, using unmetered more than 100
hours a month at the full bandwidth limit) as "abuse" and end the contracts
of those who do so. what you would need would be an ISP (or large
commercial) style contract with a guaranteeed bandwidth and dedicated ip
addresses - which do not come cheap enough to be worth giving away.
3. unmetered is only just becoming common in england, and is still mostly on
56K modem. broadband is often *massively* underprovisioned, and quite often
all the connections in an area feed to a single fixed-bandwidth multiplexor
at the telecomms office, so adding additional connections doesn't actually
add any bandwidth at all. the *only* end user deal is 500kb down, 250kb up
shared amongst *50* people in your area (the uk has a telecomms monopoly
from a recently privatised company that has already forced two would-be
competitors out of the market). Even now (given expected usage patterns) the
mere existance of a microsoft OS service pack more than 30mb in size is
enough to throw available bandwidth per-user below modem levels....

not as such, no. the vast majority of "free internet cloud" users couldn't
care less about computer resources and/or distributed computing - they want
to access websites, ftp servers and read/send their email. with a large(ish)
number of otherwise standalone nodes, you need to worry about addressing
space, routing and (to conserve what little bandwidth you have to the
classic internet) caching. ad-hoc routing also doesn't scale well - so you
get into issues of cells mapping to address ranges and dynamic allocation to
mobile nodes as they move from cell to cell (there are probably better ways
to do that than cells and static ranges, but self-networking swarms blow out
their bandwidth purely negotiating routing long before the amount of traffic
those nodes needs becomes an issue)
its possible I am wrong and there is a wonderful distributed-computing
method to solve these purely network routing problems, but it is news to me.
that would require that the new network be not only larger (and more cost
effective) but joined up enough (and routing-efficient enough) to see it
become the primary backbone. I am willing to imagine a world where "classic"
isps have a peering arrangement with such cloud networks (giving free access
to their own sites in return for free access to Cloud sites by their
customers) but there is always the prisoner's dilemma (which has been
attempted by so many ISPs lately) of refusing to peer with anyone they think
they can sell transit to instead.
A typical commercial setup (2mb bandwidth, no ratio, no contention (sharing)
over a dedicated line) is about 700ukp/month. (say about a thousand
dollars). ok, to a large commercial operation that is about the cost of one
employee - probably even less. assuming that it came out of a pr budget
though, that is one less staff member and/or one less campaign a year, for
the (dubious) benefit of whatever pr you could get by donating it. I didn't
say it was too expensive to give way, I said it was too expensive to be
*worth* giving away compared to cheaper pr stunts that don't have to paid
for every year as an ongoing cost (with all the pr loss of having to shut it
down if it becomes too much of a drain)
and that is a *recent* cost - as little as two years ago you could pay that
for a 512K link.
yes, of course there are - but they aren't cheap. the US has a history of
cheap connectivity and free local calls - the uk (along with most of the
rest of the world) doesn't.
There is a ratio thing - anyone with a home broadband connection (which is a
lot more common in london, where most of the free MAN schemes seem to be
concentrated) can afford to carry a few freeloaders on an ad-hoc basis, and
it isn't currently in the interests of the telco monopoly to crack down on
it - it doesn't cut into their core business (selling phone lines and leased
lines) and the traffic blips can be absorbed by the ISP who has statistical
models of how much they can underprovision their total sold broadband and/or
dialup pool bandwidth by without complaints (the monopoly, who is also an
ISP got its sums wrong a couple of years back when it first went unmetered
and the *average* bandwidth allocation during busy times was less than
2Kbits - and that was dialup pool only)
If the number of freeloaders became significant, and more importantly,
became predominantly home users (who want continuous high bandwidth) rather
than passing "war driving" people grabbing a few ks of download for email or
a quick website surf purely because it is cool) then it would both cut into
the bandwidth available to the person paying for it, and the higher average
load curve would alert both the isp and the telco to take a closer look at
why that user is using so much bandwidth.  This is in a world where you are
committing breach of contract to the monopoly telco's isp if you use the
unmetered home service and attempt to use a vpn connection to your
employer's network (which is "business use" and therefore needs a business
dialup account at eight times the cost) and where the unmetered service
drops the connection every two hours to prevent you running servers and
discourage large downloads....
Yes, I would like to see more MAN "guerrilla" networks to compete with the
monopoly telco - both for local links (and a surprising amount of local
traffic could happily stay local - particularly most of the high-bandwidth
games servers) and voice-over-IP. however, that isn't the same as free
internet service, as ultimately someone has to pay for the bandwidth that
leaves the local MAN cloud and travels elsewhere - and given the local
monopoly telco and the big-name so called "tier one" isps would all want
their cut, I can't see free internet ever happening in the UK - however, I
*can* see a high-bandwidth, uk only cloud that the majority of the uk users
connect to, with mail servers and webservers, supplimented by a dialup isp
account for access to the internet as a whole; could that gradually expand
until almost everything you need is reachable via "the cloud"? yes,
possibly, if you are interested only in stuff on your own continent. but I
don't expect to live long enough to see the current hierachical and
big-money dominated internet replaced by an anarchistic global cloud - not
just because of scaling and routing issues, but because the land surface
(and distribution of population centres) is just not continuous enough to
support even a continental cloud in my lifetime using current wifi
technology - and there is little enough incentive for those with a vested
interest in the system remaining as it is now to improve technology until
that *is* possible.

I would dispute that - not that it isn't used and useful, but unless you
are handing off directly to the "home" machine of the end user (or his
direct spool) odds are good that the packet will be sent unencrypted
somewhere along its journey. with TLS you are basically protecting a
single link of a transmission chain, with no control over the rest of
the chain.
Signing has a limited application - I wouldn't use it routinely other
than to establish an association (key-->poster) early in a conversation,
and then omit it except for things whose source *I* would want verified
if I was receiving it.
It is unusual for me to use a sig outside of encrypt+sign.
Depends on the definition of "know". If a poster had a regular habit of
posting at least one signed message every week, and had never protested
that the sigs were faked, then you could assume that the poster whose
sig just cleared is the same as the poster who has been posting for that
time period - mapping that to any real-world individual is more
problematic, but mostly you don't need to. There are plenty of people I
only know online from email exchanges, and in some cases am not even

encrypted using a PKI "work reduction factor" key in the message header;
this section of header is important, as lotus gateways won't accept
messages that have had it disturbed. by decoding this block, the NSA
have the actual keysize they need to block reduced to the legal export
level of 40 bits; one government found this out *after* rolling it out
to all their billing and contract negotiation departments... belgum or

other US government orgs) could break the key, rather than letting
everyone have an equal chance (and indeed, letting their customers know
their crypto was still only 40 bit vs USA intel agencies)
Still, even the domestic version was only 64 bits, which is painfully

Basically, it works like this
1. user enters five-digit pin code. code is in colours (four choices)

2. device increments an internal counter, and generates a composite code
comprising user id, current clock time and the internal counter (number
of times card used, basically)
3. device uses single-DES to encrypt that data, and then binhexes it to
give a keycode
4. user types in their username and keycode into website
5. website contacts quizid authentication server and verifies code is
valid (and that account has enough to cover the transaction)
6. website completes transaction and bills quizid company
7. quizid company bills user's credit card.
the plus side here is that the website never knows the user's credit
card details, and is given a oneshot authentication handle that is
useless once verified.
the downside is that the system has no way to verify an amount, and is
only weakly protected (both in pin (weaker than the usual four digit ATM

9/11 attack (and Shrub really needed to win a war with *someone* over that; OBL is
conspicious in his non-capturedness, but that is the problem that the Russians had with him
back when the CIA were training and funding him, so that the US can't now find him (when he
was trained by them and had all that experience dodging the russians) is little surprise).
  Note that the promised evidence (that was "utterly convincing" but "could not be released
due to security considerations") has not only not surfaced, but probably never will
(excepting the equally convenient find of "OBL's planning PC" by the Wall St Journal and
their cracking of the EFS on there in three days - which may be possible if
 isn't snakeoil, but that OBL trusted
american export crypto seems unlikely given his traning)
The intel was creatively edited at best. Given the way the US treats countries that *do*
have WMD (such as N Korea) the very fact that the attack went ahead is probably all the
evidence you need that the US didn't expect saddam to have a usable defensive force, never
mind a WMD or three.

On February 14, a Florida Appeals court ruled there is absolutely nothing illegal about
lying, concealing or distorting information by a major press organization. The court
reversed the $425,000 jury verdict in favor of journalist Jane Akre who charged she was
pressured by Fox Television management and lawyers to air what she knew and documented to be
false information. The ruling basically declares it is technically not against any law,
rule, or regulation to deliberately lie or distort the news on a television broadcast.
On August 18, 2000, a six-person jury was unanimous in its conclusion that Akre was indeed
fired for threatening to report the station's pressure to broadcast what jurors decided was
"a false, distorted, or slanted" story about the widespread use of growth hormone in dairy
cows. The court did not dispute the heart of Akre's claim, that Fox pressured her to
broadcast a false story to protect the broadcaster from having to defend the truth in court,
as well as suffer the ire of irate advertisers.
Fox argued from the first, and failed on three separate occasions, in front of three
different judges, to have the case tossed out on the grounds there is no hard, fast, and
written rule against deliberate distortion of the news. The attorneys for Fox, owned by
media baron Rupert Murdock, argued the First Amendment gives broadcasters the right to lie
or deliberately distort news reports on the public airwaves.
In its six-page written decision, the Court of Appeals held that the Federal Communications
Commission position against news distortion is only a "policy," not a promulgated law, rule,
or regulation.
Fox aired a report after the ruling saying it was "totally vindicated" by the verdict.

I believe the blank media "tax" was an international invention (amongst the music industry

was agreed (1992) but AFAIK restricted just to digital media (so CDR, DVD and minidisk) - If
there is a media tax on analog recording, I am not aware of where it is established
Canadian law doesn't distinguish between analog and digital; initially, the tax on a blank
CDR was to be $2.50 but given the then current cost of the media was under $2 that was
considered a little excessive by the public
In the UK there is no such levy, as making copies, even for personal use, is a crime (as is
in theory use of a vcr to timeshift. the UK sucks)
Yup. and copy protected audio "non cds" such as the more recent album releases are actually
an attempt to prevent you using your fair use rights, which are of course legal, without
performing an illegal circumvention of the protection under the terms of the DMCA.  Note
such prevention is not illegal in itself, despite the levy on blank media - the RIAA are
permitted to block you in any manner they see fit, they just can't sue you if you record
their stuff (but of course now they can claim you *must* have borken the DMCA terms in order

If someone has *already* issued a certificate - and ignored the CA flag - is

um, this is a **CA** - you have *one* key in the database, your CA key. It
is bad practice to generate the keys on the CA machine and transport them to
the server they will be used on - instead, the Cert request should be
generated on the end-use machine, and the *request* transported to the CA,
signed, and the certificate returned. That way, the private key never leaves
the machine it was generated for and used on, and is protected by its own
Then don't leave it running. If you got out of your car but left the engine
running, and somebody stole the car, would you blame the design of the car?
This is just fine for a root - the root acquires 'n' signing requests, opens
the program, signs or rejects the requests as appropriate, then closes the
program.  It is not the duty of the CA to generate keys or enter certificate
information - that is the requestor's problem, which he can do with the
tools appropriate to his machine (openssl on almost anything, the built in
keygen in IIS and several other webservers, and so forth. I am actually

  Fox news repeats this enough that more than half of america believes it,

  The rules are considerably more lax for the defenders than the
attackers - if you are entering another country, then you must either be
part of a uniformed, standing army or be part of a militia (with a rigid
authority structure, open carrage of arms and an identifying badge or
emblem). You must also respect the rules of war - so at least in theory,
even a uniformed "official" combatant is not entitled to the protections
of the Geneva conventions if he himself breaks those conventions (by e.g.
shooting noncombatants)
  If you are defending though, you are entitled to the protection of the
geneva convention (and lawful combatant status) simply by being an "open"
hostile (carrying your weaponry openly and obeying all the usual
provisions of the geneva convention, which obviously doesn't allow hiding
in a crowd of civilians). This is the "take up arms" provision so beloved
of the american people - that in the face of invasion, the ordinary
citizen would "take up arms" to defend his home and neighbours.
  There is considerable doubt as to exactly how this applies to sniping -
certainly, uniformed combatants are little less likely to decide to dive
into cover and "take out" their opponents with aimed fire than random
undertrained militia are, and it would be insane for a lone "take up arms"
defender to stand out in the open to "duke it out"; the problem is a
random sniper is difficult to locate *after* an attack if he is not
otherwise identifiable; ok, he isn't permitted to drop his weapon and
retain his lawful combatant status, but nor could a uniformed individual
(one of several) be expected to volunteer that he was the one who just
killed four of the team now pointing weapons at him..... (the "take up
arms" provision seems to assume the defender picks up a gun and continues
firing until he is killed, captured, or he wins :)

for virtual drives, the real question is at what point in the boot process
you can mount a drive - if it is not until the os is fully functional, then
you are unable to protect the os itself. if the bootstrap process can mount
the drive before the os is functional, then you *can* protect the os. Win9x
uses dos as its bootstrap (and drivespace gives a good example of a virtual
drive system that can hand over to a 32bit driver as the os starts). lilo
*could* kick a virtual drive into existence during the kernel boot, given
such a driver and some patches to both kernel and lilo itself.  that it
would need a password from somewhere during this process is both obvious and

no, you can't. data from the hardware is *still* encrypted; only the
output of the driver is decrypted, and a machine no longer running
bootstrap or os is also incapable of decryption. you *could*, if good
enough, place the processor in a halt state and use DMA to modify the
code to reveal the plaintext, but it would be a major pain to do so and
would require both physical access to the machine *while powered up and
without triggering any anti-tamper switches* after the password has been
supplied. This is actually a weakness in firmware cryptodrives (as I
have seen advertised recently) - once the drive is "unlocked" it can
usually be swapped over to another machine and the plaintext read.
Indeed so, yes. however, usually that decision has to be made before the
password would be entered - so making more awkward. you *could* finangle
the bootstrap though; there must *always* be part of the code outside

  Oh, and as to the "murder" bit, IIRC the captain of a ship or plane may
legally kill you if he believes this is required for the safety of his
vessel and passengers as a whole - I would hate to see the paperwork

If any one airline decides to impose a blanket requirement (all passengers
must show ID) then that is fine. If all airlines decide to do so
independently (or even as a joint response to a situation) then that is
fine, but probably could do with a little scrutiny to make sure it really
was their idea.  However, false ID is easily enough obtained.
If the federal government decides to impose (or even "strongly recommend")
such a scheme, and further provides a list of "no fly" people (purely on
name, so you can't tell if the joe bloggs you have at your desk is a
terrorist threat, someone who wrote a purple-ink letter to the president
last year, or some other joe bloggs who is really unlucky in his choice of

Nope. issuing certs to someone is trivial from both a server and a user
endpoint - the user just gets a "click here to request your key" and hits ok
on a few dialog boxes; the server simply hosts some pretty off-the-shelf
Not so much that as have a much bigger security issue. Maintaining keys
securely would then become a task for the client, and while keeping a
written password secret is something most people can handle the concept of,
keeping a block of computer data safe from random trojans while exporting it
to be transported between machines is much, much harder.
Of course, you *could* generate the key entirely locally on the server,
protecting it with a HTTPS download, and protect it with the enduser's
password (not sure how secure the PKCS password is - if it isn't, then use
some self-decoding-exe like the 7z one) but that still wouldn't force the
end user to do more than hit "import" and have it stored insecurely on their
client machine.
its surprisingly reliable and easy - particuarly if your end users are just
using the MS keystore, which requires them to do no more than double-click
the pkcs file and hit "next" a few times.

The problem is here, we are blaming the protective device for not being able
to protect against the deliberate use of an attack that bypasses, not
challenges it - by exploiting the gullibility or tendency to take the path
of least resistance of the user.
The real weakness in HTTPS is the tendency of certificates signed by Big
Name CAs to be automagically trusted - even if you have never visited that
site before.  yes, you can fix this almost immediately by untrusting the
root certificate - but then you have to manually verify each and every site
at least once, and possibly every time if you don't mark the cert as
"trusted" for future reference.
To blame HTTPS for an attack where the user fills in a web form received via
html-rendering email (no https involved at all) is more than a little unfair
I am not aware of one (not that that means much, given I am a novice in this
Even PKI relies on something close to a shared secret - a *trustworthy* copy
of the public key, matching a secret copy of the private key. In x509, this
trustworthyness is established by an Ultimately Trusted CA; in pgp, by the
Web Of Trust, in a chain leading back to your own key; in SSH, by your
placing of the public key into your home dir manually (using some other form
of authentication to presumably gain access)
in each of these cases, the private key will almost invariably be protected
by a passphrase; at best, you can have a single passphrase (or even single
private key) to cover all bases.. but that just makes that secret all the
more valuable.
That is pretty much because defence occupies the position of the interior -
attackers will almost invariably attack weak points, not strong ones. It is
easy to log and calculate how many attacks happen on weak points, but
impossible to calculate how many attacks *would* have happened had the
system not been in place to protect against such attacks, so the attackers
moved onto easier targets.
It makes little sense to try and break one https connection (even at 40 bit)
if by breaking into the server you get that information, hundreds of others
(until discovered) and possibly thousands of others inadvisedly stored
unprotected in a database.
Which again matches well to the Nigerian analogy. Everyone *knows* that
handing over your bank details is a Bad Thing - yet they still do it.

  That it is no different from shouting "fire" in a crowded theatre -
which appears to be the standard example in this sort of discussion.
  If you chose to see it that way, yes. Enough holocaust deniers have
tried to duke it out in court and lost that I am more than a bit
sceptical about yet another one. The deeds of the nazis were so dark the
term "war crime" was almost invented to deal with them - certainly the
hague court was - and the nazis are such an obvious black reference
point that almost anyone seems clean by comparison.
  The worst excesses of the nazis are increasingly in the past - well
over half a century ago now - and there has been no credible evidence
presented in that time that the jewish lobby invented or exaggerated
anything that happened in those death camps for their own gain.
  I class the holocaust deniers pretty much the same as the religious
fanatics who try to deny evolution - firmly convinced of their own
rightness, despite an overwhelming body of evidence disproving their
position.  Its nice they have firmly held beliefs, but I don't feel any
real reason to listen to them, and a big enough body of people trying to
force *their* beliefs on me is irksome (cue any of asimov's frequent
comments on "ignorance waving the bible")
If you are asking if I believe that people should be prosecuted for
simply believing this, or even publicly stating this belief then no - it
is only when (like with evolution) they try to get their version of
events accepted as the "official" version that they should provide
proof - if (for example) a history teacher taught his entire class that
WW2 was in fact started by the jews and that they turned on the nazis
when they saw the war was lost, faking evidence to make it look like,
far from being equal partners with the nazis in the war, they were a
persecuted minority - then I would expect that teacher to be suspended
at the very least, if not prosecuted (hence the evidence - he would be
free to present his overwhelmingly persuasive evidence as to the true
facts of the war in court)

I personally think the biggest problem with almost any label of
universal disgust (and "Holocaust denier" is almost as good as
"pedophile" for this purpose) is that it gets abused as a method to
suppress unrelated or marginally related discussion. Holocaust denier is
a bad label for someone who (for example) doubts the "skin lampshades"
story - they aren't denying the holocaust, they are arguing for the
untruth of a selected fact; only by questioning the validity of
individual elements of an accepted theory can you maintain the truth of
that theory, or find a greater truth that extends human knowledge.
saying "$FOO is provably true so you must accept unquestioningly
everything I ever say as being equally true, regardless of proof" is as
unreasonable a position as denying $FOO without any counterproof to the
original assertion.
  Doubting the validity (or legallity) of Israeli policy in the occupied

Indeed so - but saying that (in their opinion) RSA IS implimented better and
more securely in puTTY than DSA can hardly be the same as saying DSA should
be avoided. As I understand it, the problem with DSA is that it is *very*
dependent on the random number being random (collisions leading to
weaknesses) - and everyone knows that windows is bad at RNG. What (as I
understand it) the new putty scheme does is use the secret key to obfusc the
random value a little - hashing it with both the private key and the hash of
the message being signed - hoping to pull enough entropy out of those two to
reduce the possibility of discovery of the random value due to it being
limited to a subset of the "range" it should have. obviously, this approach
won't produce gold from straw - you still have a limited set of possible
values - but it should distribute them evenly across the range in a
key-dependent manner, so that knowlege of the limited possible values would
have to be per-key or involve knowledge of the private key (which is a
game-over scenario anyhow)
so my understanding of the above warning is that the games puTTY plays with
the keyspace is *probably* enough to fix the lousy randomness of the windows
platform - but they recommend that you use RSA where the randomness of a
prng is not an issue.

on the plus side - it apparently uses Sha-1 for a signing algo, RSA with a
max keysize of 16Kbits (overkill, but better than enforcing something
stupidly small), built in NTP synch for timestamps (probably spoofable,
but at least a valiant attempt to keep timestamps accurate "by default")
and supports a range of file, folder, email and chat crypto with a
onscreen keyboard for password entry (again, not unbeatable but a valiant
next step is the symmetric component though - which shows more than slight
traces of oil.
First is a randomly generated session key, protected by the RSA
component - on the face of it fine (its how pgp and smime do it, after
all) but no details are given on *how* the random key is obtained (the
code apparently "contains a true random number generator" which seems
doubtful) and the symmetric component is a proprietary algo (for which
source is provided, but even so...)
Second is pretty much pgp's conventional mode - but with a user supplied
key. no mention of hashing, and again, the proprietary algo is in use.
Third is True One Time Pad - yes well duh! I could write one in eight

IIRC, PGPfone ( did something similar, with a "verbal handshake" protocol that relied on you being able to recognise the remote party's voice over the phone while speaking a list of words.... always seemed both unreliable and odd in something with "PGP" in the name, but....
Raw data streams would be fine over a point to point modem link - but I can see an advantage to compartmentalization - you can break your secure phone problem down into two distinct subproblems
a) establishing a secure IP VPN between two nodes
b) optimizing VoIP for low bandwidth links
I would add a third - a modem protocol based on something like CSMA/CD to allow conference calls to be used as carrier media for secure conversations, but that is too hairy for me :)
Something like OpenVPN ( seems ideal for the secure VPN part of the problem, but requires an underlying IP network.... the VoIP part of the problem has a embarrassment of riches; H323 used to come as standard with windows, in the form of Netmeeting (complete with videoconferencing and whiteboarding) and SIP is now part of Windows XP (a not-particuarly-well-documented) "feature" of windows messager. There are many, many more, and Asterix (sadly not particularly well known, and unix only) is a complete, open source PBX which is conventional telephony, SIP and H323 aware.
OpenVPN is of course built on SSL, and can use either X509 certificates or a preshared key for authentication. Sadly, there is no convenient way to use DNS-SEC key records for OpenVPN.

you can do SSL over UDP if you like - I think most VPN software is UDP only, while OpenVPN has a "fallback" TCP mode for cases where you can't use UDP (and TBH there aren't many)

PGPfone had that problem, even over landlines (no IP involved) - however, I think that was more do to with the compression codecs and the crypto than any external problems, as switching to half-duplex usually cleared the problems up.
The strength of a pure VPN solution is that you aren't limited to *just* VoIP - you can transfer files, use whiteboarding, run videoconferencing, support text channels..... even play games :)

"easy-to-use AES encryption to protect your sensitive data." We exhibit
several attacks against WinZip's new encryption method, dubbed "AE-2" or
"Advanced Encryption, version two." We then discuss secure alternatives.
Since at a high level the underlying WinZip encryption method appears
secure (the core is exactly Encrypt-then-Authenticate using AES-CTR and
HMAC-SHA1), and since one of our attacks was made possible because of the
way that WinZip Computing, Inc.~decided to fix a different security
problem with its previous encryption method AE-1, our attacks further
underscore the subtlety of designing cryptographically secure software.

Unless I am mistaken as to the Quantum Key Exchange process, only one

   I note also that, as QKE is *extremely* vulnerable to MitM attacks, a
hybrid system (which need only be tactically secure, not strategically
secure) can be used to "lock out" a MitM attacker for long enough that
his presence can be detected, without having to resort to a classical
but unblockable out of band data stream.  I think this is part of the
purpose behind the following paper:
which I am currently trying to understand and failing miserably at *sigh*

Unless someone has come up with a new wrinkle to this since I last looked, the QKE system indeed requires three channels - the key photon one which must be optical, and a conventional comms pair (the latter of course can be substituted with any comms pair you have handy, but if you are running fibre from A to B you might as well run three)
As all three require MiTM to be mounted, it would be better to have a physically diverse path for the conventional pair - but in a small city where you are patching the optical channel though the nearest exchange, this may not be practicable.

Indeed so. however, the argument "in 1998, a FPGA machine broke a DES key in 72 hours, therefore TODAY..." assumes that (a) the problems are comparable, and (b) that moores law has been applied to FPGAs as well as    I am unaware of any massive improvement (certainly to the scale of the comparable improvement in CPUs) in FPGAs, and the ones I looked at a a few days ago while researching this question seemed to have pretty much the same spec sheet as the ones I looked at back then. However, I am not a gate array techie, and most of my experience with them has been small (two-three chip) devices at very long intervals, purely for my own interest. It is possible there has been a quantum leap foward in FPGA tech or some substitute tech that can perform massively parallel calculations, on larger block sizes and hence more operations, at a noticably faster rate than the DES cracker could back then.
Schneier apparently believes there has been - but is simply applying moore's law to the machine from back then, and that may not be true unless he knows something I don't (I assume he knows lots of things I don't, but of course he may not have thought this one though :)

@_subject: undersea cable cuts 
I was under the impression that there were regeneration nodes every so many tends of KM (essentially receiver/emitter pairs, with a bit of logic in the middle to reshape the pulses to keep them clean) and always assumed at least some of those were equipped with additional logic to allow a suitably equipped sub to simply clamp an inductive coil around the node and "ask" the node to emit signal in EM form so the sub could listen in... how many of the bundled fibres you could that for in parallel would be a design issue though, albeit a minor one (using a clamp-on coil surrounding the entire node, you could pretty much use the entire radio spectrum as bandwidth and assign one frequency per repeater; I suspect you would need to supply power inductively too though, given the power requirements for an "active" node of this time would go though the roof compared to normal operation.)

If you are still on the continental shelf, I guess scuba kit and a suitable cutting tool (or shaped charge)
   As has been noted previously (perhaps elsewhere; nanog is discussing this too) there was a case where concrete "holdoffs" where placed above a cable to protect it from a natural gas pipe laid atop it; with the weight of the pipe and time, the holdoffs sank into the sea bed and severed the cable in several places.
   That was poor design; however, similar emplacements would presumably be fairly economic to produce, and would have the added feature of making it hard for the repair vessels to trawl up the cable for repairs if there were still existing blocks pinning it down in the area they are attempting to lift cable. making the downward facing edge deliberately a curved blade is an obvious "improvement" to the design, and could actually be helped by attempts to repair the cable - tug up the cable against the block, and have it severed *again* at the point you are attempting to trawl up (at which juncture, the severed end will slip out of your hook and back to the ocean floor). Given even half hearted timing, you could place the blocks weeks or even months before, meaning nobody could easily trace back your presence in the area to the time of the "event".
   Still don't see any terrorist benefit to doing so though.

Extremism is a possible explanation, but given they stole a whole heap
of expensive networking equipment, it is equally possible it was
financially motivated, rather than political.
Could be both as well, of course - that would make funding other attacks
easier, while also disrupting capitalists in the capitol :)

Don't even have to do that. For the UK solution, the entire *site* is
redirected to the url-checking server, who then passes though "clean"
urls, and blocks "bad" ones.
So, best choice is to visit squeaky clean pages. Lots of them,
preferably ones with lots of image content the checking server will need
to proxy, and as wide a range as possible to invalidate the caching.

Isn't that the procedural equivalent though of saying "you should always
keep your cryptographic algorithm secret and only disclose an algorithm
as a ploy to deceive"?
Any good methodology, be it technological, cryptographic, or procedural,
consists of elements which *must* be kept secret (the fewer the better),
and elements which need not be. Disclosing the latter makes it easier to
get peer review, encourages other people to use the same methodologies
(which at worst increases the value of a break to an attacker, and at
best allows the original poster's traffic to be "lost in the noise"
amongst a larger amount of similar) and allows other people to build on
that base and present different (and potentially better) methods.
as Schneier has said repeatedly, any idiot can design something he can't
figure how to break himself. Getting peer review of anything you might
end up betting your life on, has to be worth its cost.

A good Nym has a life of its own, and the reputation is attached to THAT
life - almost impossible to transfer unless you are willing to
compromise the Nym by linking it to somewhere else.
No reason why the Nym-identity can't build a good reputation though, and
I know of several that have done so.

Its a nice theory, but doesn't cover first-visit scenarios, nor the
yearly rekey grind of giving CAs (large amounts of) money for the
results of a fairly easy math problem.
What I would prefer is some parallel system where person 'x', who I
trust, may or may not have visited site 'y', and may or may not have
signed the then certificate, the signature for which (with its date of
providence) is then stored *on the site* for me to access though a
well-known url. That way, I can look with suspicion at sites which do
not have such a certificate, investigate myself if they are serving the
certificate I am expecting to see (and how do I do that? I have tried in
the past phoning companies to obtain their website public key for
independent verification; most don't know what one is, a few have even
said they can't disclose that as it is *priviledged information*....)
But, who do I trust for that, who do *you* trust for that, and will
those people be wiling to give up a significant slice of time every year
revisiting websites after their certificates are renewed, and facing the
same hurdles I did (the complete ignorance of most companies as to how
their websites' certificate works and unwillingness to supply an
accurate fingerprint over the phone).

They can. There is the revocation issue (once a certificate passes its
validity date, they no longer need to store a revocation for it if it
was revoked; for one and two year certificates that is only one or two
years, but if it were longer than that the CRL would be correspondingly
larger. certificates can *specify* where the CRL is, giving a mechanism
to assign a different URL to each year's offerings, but surprisingly,
many of the older CAs don't use it and rely on the browser having
hard-coded data for the CRL.
I think it is more that most sites don't want to pay that sort of cash
up front for their cert - with the current crop of EV certificates
exceeding  a 10 year cert would be in excess of  and a 20
year 9K or more. even with a discount, that's a *lot* of upfront cost
for a business.
Another factor is that prices for normal certificates have been steadily
declining, year on year, for some time now - even given that money *now*
is worth more than money this time next year, if the cert is going to be
cheaper next year in absolute terms, you would be ill advised to to buy
too many years up front at the higher price.
EV is another good example of a factor; it didn't exist a few years ago,
now it is a "must have" for big name sites. What will the next big thing
be five years from now, and would it mean discarding your expensive 10
year certificate for the new and more secure "we really really check you
are who you claim to be, this time, honest" Super EV that is then
considered a requirement?
Finally, will you still be called the same thing ten years from now?
companies change, their branding (and corporate image) changes, they
merge and split; you may not wish to have five more years as
 if you no longer make widgets, and your company name
has changed to megagadget...
still a lot of one year certs out there - bigger sites may find the
trouble of renewal on what is only a small difference in price an issue,
and thus go with a longer certificate, but the default for most
purchases is the One year cert. But regardless - the whole pricing
structure of the CA market is commercial - certificates exist *only* to
make money for commercial CAs; any actual security benefit is a side effect.
Because it doesn't.
the vast majority of browsers don't report a certificate that has
changed since your last visit - because they don't keep a copy of the
certificate to verify against. Those that do have been specifically
modified for that purpose by their users - as is detailed in this
thread, pretty much - and suffer from the first visit problem because
there is no mechanism to say "if it is a cert I don't have, verify it
against the CA, tell me which CA it is (and if that seems a sane choice)
and then store a copy so next time I have my own standard to refer to".
There is also no mechanism to chain from a trusted certificate that is
due to expire (or already has) to a new, not yet verified one. But then,
there is no commercial incentive for either of these features, as
browsers are happy to support the commercial CA model, and certainly the
commercial CAs don't want anyone to leave the hierarchical "CA as god"
You should be able to check the certificate chain on the object and see.
I haven't tried this (and given its 1am I am not going to now, but I may
do so when I get time :)

Indeed, and many get scammed, then find the peddler they bought their
"bargain" from isn't there the next day when they return.
Its certainly getting that way now. My local butchers are unable to make
their own sausages - because the requirements for documenting and
providing the ingredients for each "product" apply to that, and it is
not economically viable to go though that process when they can instead
buy a standard "mix" from a supplier, add a specified weight of
specified meats, and then use the supplier's pre-certified documentation
and ingredients list.
Does that protect us against rogue food providers? possibly. Does it
stop my (formerly award winning) butcher from selling me a superior
product instead of the standardized one? yes, it does.
On the internet, nobody knows you are a dog.
On your website, nobody can tell if you are or aren't really BigBank,
BigBoxShifter, or BigManufacturer; there is therefore a market for
certifying this, and the current climate (where you get to choose in a
competitive market which lizard you select, but must select a lizard) is
a viable approach; however, its plainly biassed in favour of the current
incumbents, who have a vested interest in keeping prices high and
consolidating against outsiders.
A distributed model would be good, but even leaving aside key
distribution issues for your trusted recommenders, it means that you are
basing your own trust decision on two things - one, that the person
certifying the site is himself trustworthy, and two, that the process
was not compromised (if I wished to establish a scam site, and a
distributed model was in place, the first few transactions would be
*amazingly* honest and I would take pains to get those first few
certifications well established... then fight tooth and nail to hang on
to them and prevent any revocation being posted, no matter how many
other people I scammed based on the mistaken trust assertion made by the
early visitors.)
Or could be badly advised as to the trustworthyness of some of her
couriers - because she herself doesn't know if a particular supplicant
is honest and trustworthy, so must rely on others to assert that to her.
But in essence, even if you have a lot of trustworthy friends, whose
online community of interest is similar to yours, you are going to have
to be first visitor to at least some of the sites - and the trust
decision is then going to have to be made by you based on something
other than the distributed network.
The future will *always* have lusers. It's in the nature of the system -
spam and phishing scams would not exist if there wasn't a profitable
minority who believe that yes, there *is* a Nigerian out there who
wishes to give them 6 million dollars, and all he needs is their bank
details... that 90%+ of all email is now of this type just shows there
is a profit to be made from the gullible being gullible. All attempts to
"do something" about this will not make the gullible any safer, but will
restrict what *you* can do without the permission of the state. Laws
are, for the most part, to force the law abiding to not do things the
scofflaws will ignore anyhow, even if the law abiding previously had a
legitimate reason to do so.

@_subject: fingerprinting traffic at ISP for big content 
Its complex. the surprising and short answer is - bit torrent traffic
does not have *any* file names; the torrent descriptor file contains the
file layout, individual file hashes, and an overall hash that is used to
reference the torrent in communications (in fact, no torrent client will
talk to you unless you reference a file hash it is currently holding
"live", either for download or seeding).
Alternative distributed peer locating systems and "trackerless" cloud
torrents have a secondary system for handling this information, but move
the actual data using the torrent protocols. You also get "private"
trackers, who require a unique registered token per registered user
before they will share peer information. Most of these prohibit
alternative peer finding mechanisms, which is good, but conversely also
track which torrents users have uploaded and how much (in bytes) which,
given those logs are kept, is potentially a goldmine for anyone wishing
to link interest in a given file to a list of people who have
"distributed" it in part or whole.

@_subject: Money in a closed ecosystem 
I disagree. While the total value of the system compared to the external
world can indeed grow (and be balanced by an outflow of some saleable
resource, either physical or not) the amount of needed in-circulation
cash is going to be pretty close to constant, if you can disregard
you still need a bank - people will need to exchange the non-physical
value of their wages for physical tokens (cash) and will spend those at
retail for food, clothing etc. a certain amount will remain in the bank
(as savings) or be transferred electronically for mail order goods)
however, all money spent at retail will be in the cash registers of the
retailers who will invariably then take at least some of it to the bank,
to be credited to their account. This account will then be used to pay
wages (for their own workers) and buy in fresh supplies of resources
(electronically). Some will no doubt skip this step, and issue wages
from receipts and buy some materiel in cash (so freshly caught raw meat,
etc) but that doesn't cause the cash to leave the system - its new
owners will either spend it at retail or bank it, thus recycling the
tokens they have.
no matter how you look at it, the amount in people's wallets won't vary
that much, and once spent, will either be placed in other people's
wallets, or in the bank (where it can be re-issued to the people who
spent it in the first place). The only reasons you can need new physical
tokens in the system are inflation (items are costing more, so the
amount of in-wallet cash you need to carry is larger), physical tokens
are leaving the system - so, raw materiel bought in cash from outside
the system, people leaving Antarctica and taking cash with them - or if
the number of people in the system is increasing, which of course is
