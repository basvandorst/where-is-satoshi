@_subject: Denmark, update on Echelon 
Just a short notice on the Echelon-discussion in Denmark
The danish parliament Folketinget has declined to aid the EU committee
which is investigating Echelon. The EU committee formally contacted the
head of the parliaments permanent select committee for controlling the
intelligence-services -- in danish: kontroludvalget for
efterretningstjenesterne -- asking for information regarding parliamentary
control with the danish intelligence services.
No confidential information was asked for. Just the basic info on how the
select committee works.
The head of the committee, Thor Pedersen from the liberal party Venstre
declined to aid the EU committee. He did this without informing the select
committee or the parliament. This caused some uproar when we disclosed his
doings in Ekstra Bladet, but later the decision has been upheld at a
meeting in the select committee. Complaints have now been filed against
Thor Pedersen.
This means that Denmark is one of only two EU-countries parliaments have
declined to help the EU committee: The other declining parliament is the
british. No other EU countries have stepped aside. Indeed they have been
rather helpful with the EU committee.
Thor Pedersens decision has infuriated the members of EU-parliament Lone
Dybkjaer, (party: Det Radikale Venstre, married to our prime minister) and
Torben Lund, (party: Socialdemokratiet, which is the governing party in
Denmark) Both are members of the EU committee, and both have declared they
have no doubt Echelon exists.
Meanwhile, the danish signals intelligence-service Forsvarets
Efterretningstjeneste is continuing to upgrade their equipment. The
SIGINT-site at Skibsbylejren has been equipped with three satellite
dishes, all 18 meters across. There are plans to erect further three
dishes of the same size. The dishes are solely planned for interceptions.
According to building plans a radius around the area must be cleared of
all electronic emissions, including cell phone towers and welding
equipment. Also tall buildings will be prohibited in the area around the
30 meters tall radomes containing the dishes. Bo Elkjaer, Denmark

United States Patent 6,163,841 Venkatesan ,   et al. December 19, 2000 Technique for producing privately authenticatable cryptographic signatures
and for authenticating such signatures A technique for generating, for a given message to be signed, an authentic cryptographic signature that can be authenticated, by a recipient of the signed message, as having originated from a signor of the message; and
appropriately authenticating such a signature. Specifically, this
technique, given a message, such as, e.g., a numerical product copy
identifier (83, 93), forms an authentic signature (87, 97), based on
public-key cryptosystem, through use of generator value selected from
points on an elliptic curve over a finite field. The authentic signature is generated using the generator value in conjunction with three keys; namely, a public key, a private key and a secret key, and thus substantially increases the security associated with cryptographic
signatures generated through a conventional two-key public-key
cryptosystem. A unique product copy indicia can be formed by concatenating
the identifier, for a given product copy, with its corresponding authentic
signature. During subsequent user installation of that copy to a computer,
the user enters the indicia when prompted by execution of an installation
program which, in turn, privately authenticates the signature contained in
the indicia in order to continue or prematurely terminate the installation. Inventors: Venkatesan; Ramarathnam R. (Bellevue, WA); Montgomery;

The danish minister of trade Pia Gjellerup has stated in a public letter
to industrial leaders and organisations, that she will work for an
annulment of the note. This was confirmed to me personally by the danish
delegate to Wassenaar, Bjarne Bitsch a couple of weeks ago, although he
couldn't guarantee 'what might happen at the last moment. There's
allways a political risk in these things'. Things seems to be clearing up, though. The danish government has been
under a lot of pressure both w. regards to Wassenaar and the recent
Echelon-debate, and the leading danish industrial organisation Dansk
Industri has declared that they intend to put a lot of force into the
annulment of the note. They also want the remaining crypto-products
released, but have low expectatios on this.

withhold it. Lets see if it keeps. Bo Elkjaer, Denmark

Last thursday a friend and colleague of mine visited the danish SIGINT
site Skibsbylejren, which is under reconstruction and enhancement. They're
building new 23 meters tall, 30 meters wide radomes. Three radomes are
more or less finished by now, three more are planned to be built soon.
My friend visited the site with a local politician.
So they went in on the enclosed area (through the unlocked gate) and
knocked on the door of a trailer parked near one of the radomes. This guy
jumps up inside the trailer, rushes to the door blocking their access, and
tells them 'you're not supposed to be here'. He's obviously american,
wearing overalls and a blue workmans shirt with a round printed badge on
left pocket: NOOS in the middle, US Department of Commerce along the
NOOS is short for four words - which also were printed in the badge, but
they didn't get the time to read the words before the american ran away
and eight danish military intelligence officers showed up and threw my
friend and the politician out.
My friend works for national radio, and they were visiting the site so she
could interview the politician for a news-piece on signals intelligence in
Denmark. The story about the american broke big time this morning and will
be discussed in parliament later today.

@_subject: New patent: Auto-escrowable and auto-certifiable cryptosystems with fast key generation  
Patent 6,243,466, granted june 5. 2001.
Auto-escrowable and auto-certifiable cryptosystems with fast key
generation A method is provided for an escrow cryptosystem that is overhead-free,
does not require a cryptographic tamper-proof hardware implementation
(i.e., can be done in software), is publicly verifiable, and cannot be
used subliminally to enable a shadow public key system. A shadow public
key system is an unescrowed public key system that is publicly displayed
in a covert fashion. The keys generated by the method are auto-recoverable
and auto-certifiable (abbrev. ARC). The ARC Cryptosystem is based on a key
generation mechanism that outputs a public/private key pair, and a
certificate of proof that the key was generated according to the
algorithm. Each generated public/private key pair can be verified
efficiently to be escrowed properly by anyone. The verification procedure
does not use the private key. Hence, the general public has an efficient
way of making sure that any given individual's private key is escrowed
properly, and the trusted authorities will be able to access the private
key if needed. Since the verification can be performed by anyone, there is
no need for a special trusted entity, known in the art as a "trusted third
party". Furthermore, the system is designed so that its internals can be
made publicly scrutinizable (e.g., it can be distributed in source code
form). This differs from many schemes which require that the escrowing
device be tamper-proof hardware. The system has a novel feature that the
system parameters can be generated very efficiently and at the same time
provide a very high level of security. Another novel feature is a method
for making the certificates of recoverability publishable. The system is
applicable for law-enforcement, file systems, e-mail systems, certified
e-mail systems, and any scenario in which public key cryptography can be
employed and where private keys or information encrypted under public keys
need to be recoverable.

The british parliament have acknowledged membership of the UKUSA
agreement. It happened in the annual report 1999-2000 from the
Intelligence and Security Comittee.
Link: The danish primeminister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen was handed the report in
march, but apparantly decided to try to bury it. The following article was printed in Ekstra Bladet today.
Bo Elkjaer, Denmark
BRITISH SPIES: WE ARE PART OF UKUSA
The British intelligence service has admitted for the first time that they
cooperate with the USA on surveillance through the UKUSA agreement. For
several months now, Denmark's prime minister has had proof that the
surveillance agreement behind Echelon exists.
Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has had an official British acknowledgement of the
spy agreement behind Echelon in his possession for several months. The
British confirmation is in writing, and it confirms the fact that the
British and the Americans cooperate closely on intelligence assignments
under the UKUSA agreement. The UKUSA cooperation is accused of standing
behind the Echelon system, and it is the first time that any of the
involved parties officially mention the existence of the controversial
agreement whose precise contents are still classified.
The Intelligence and Security Committee of the British Parliament
mentions the close cooperation in its annual report for 1999-2000. The
report was delivered to Great Britain's prime minister Tony Blair in
August of last year, but Denmark's prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has
known about the report since March of this year at least.
'The quality of the compiled intelligence clearly indicates the value of
this close cooperation under the UKUSA agreement,' says the official
British report, which subsequently, and in great detail, reveals how close
the cooperation between the British and the Americans actually is.
The report mentions as an example that the British took over the
assignments of the USA's National Security Agency (NSA) for three days in
2000, when the NSA's computers broke down. For three days, the British
were capable of servicing their own 'clients', as well as the USA's, by
tapping telefaxes, e-mails and phone conversations.
The British report confirms in writing the very same issues about which
several Danish parties have been trying to get Denmark's prime minister,
Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, to ask Great Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair:
whether the US and Great Britain are cooperating on surveillance.
NOT MY TABLE
Through a secretary, prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen refuses to
comment. He refers the matter to the Ministry of Defence. Yet in spite of Nyrup's referral, Minister of Defence Jan TrÃ¸jborg is also
unwilling to comment on the Echelon case that is putting the government
under increasing pressure.
The chairman of the Socialist Party, Holger K. Nielsen, informs Ekstra
Bladet that he will try to force Poul Nyrup Rasmussen to contact Tony
Blair regarding an Echelon inquiry, possibly by going around the
government to get a majority:
"They might as well do it now. The pressure from the parties will continue
to increase. It's unreasonable that this information should just be
quietly ignored.
Is it acceptable that with the information now in its possession the
government keeps refusing to inform the public, to organise any kind of
investigation or merely to send an inquiry to Great Britain? "No, it is not acceptable. In my opinion, they should contact Great
Britain in the form of an inquiry," says Holger K. Nielsen.
"This affair concerns the European countries, and I find it very
unacceptable that Great Britain is hedging its bets here."
"The Echelon Report from the European Parliament particularly emphasises
the industrial conflicts between the USA and Europe. In my opinion, Great
Britain is playing Trojan Horse in this game, which is unacceptable.
Hopefully, the government will realise that they must react." Do you think they will?
"They appear quite intractable. But in light of the fact that the European
Parliament places such a high priority on the case, they can't keep
avoiding the issue." DEMANDS CLARITY
Prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen learned about the British report,
which confirms the intelligence cooperation, in March in connection with
an official question asked in a session of parliament. The question to the
prime minister was submitted by member of parliament Keld Albrechtsen
after Ekstra Bladet had sent a copy of the annual report of the British
intelligence agency to Mr Albrechtsen for a comment. Instead, Mr
Albrechtsen chose to formulate a question to the prime minister, who
replied one month later, on 26 April 2001.
In his reply, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen merely stated that neither the Danish
Defence Intelligence Service nor the Police Department's intelligence
service are willing to comment on the cooperation agreements of other
countries in the intelligence field. Thus two other highly placed
ministers must know about the global surveillance, i.e. Minister of
Justice Frank Jensen and Minister of Defence Jan TrÃ¸jborg.
A few days ago, Helge Adam MÃ¸ller, MP for the Conservative Party, tried to
get a majority of parliament to force Nyrup Rasmussen to ask Blair about
Echelon. The Liberal Party refused to support the proposal however. Ekstra Bladet asked the Liberal Party's spokesman in the area whether it
was acceptable that the government refused to inform the general public
about Echelon or to ask the British about the matter.
"What is seriously unacceptable is that the government has trouble
deciding what to inform the parliament about," says Kristian Jensen. "The Radical Liberal Party in the government says that Denmark should do
something about Echelon and the Social Democrats say it doesn't even
exist. It is unacceptable to us that the government can't make up its mind
on the issue. Therefore, our first demand is that the government should
get control over its own legs and agree on what it knows about Echelon and
on what it intends to tell the Danish parliament," says Kristian Jensen.
"So we're looking for some clear answers from the government as to what it
can tell us about Echelon and what the government's position actually is."
After Ekstra Bladet's disclosure, Knud Erik Hansen of the Socialist Party
will now request a meeting with Poul Nyrup Rasmussen on the matter.

Bo Elkjaer, Denmark
In 1965, James Ellis, who worked for CSG (GCHQ's codemaking department),
went back to first principles to solve the problem and dreamed up the
unthinkable. His vision was sending secret messages without the need for
exchanging a key. Suppose Alice wants to send a message to Bob. Alice
looks up Bob's "public" key and encodes her message using a standard
algorithm. Bob receives the message and decodes it using his "private" key
and another standard algorithm.
Anyone can intercept the message because the public key is widely known,
but only possession of the private key enables the decoding step.
The private key remains in Bob's possession throughout and never has to be
passed to Alice, thus guaranteeing confidentiality.
By 1967 public key cryptography had hit a brick wall. Mr Ellis was not
able to come up with a private key function to bring his theory to life.
But in September 1973 bright young Cambridge graduate Clifford Cocks
joined GCHQ. After six weeks, the puzzle was presented to Mr Cocks and
within half an hour he came up with a solution - an algorithm that made Mr
Ellis' theory a real possibility.
In 1975, these ideas were refined further by Mr Cocks' colleague Malcolm
Because they were employees of GCHQ, they were sworn to secrecy and their
brilliant idea was never made public.
In 1976, a trio of American academics, Diffie, Hellman and Merkle, filed a
patent for their version of public key cryptography which they developed
independently. They went on to claim the glory for developing the system.

@_subject: List of documents from ILETS 97 seminar on lawful interception 
The following is a documentlist obtained from the danish
ministry of information technology and science concerning the
international law enforcement telecommunications seminar ILETS 97 held
january 1997 in Dublin.
I haven't been able to locate the documents listed and all FOIA-requests
concerning the documents have consequently been denied under exceptions
concerning national security and Denmarks relations to foreign
Anyhow, since only a few tidbits of information have surfaced from the ILETS
seminars over the years I thought that the documentlist still might be
interesting enough to be worth publishing.

@_subject: THESE ARE YOUR DEAD CHILDREN, PRIMEMINISTER -- 
It's not only in USA and UK that pressure is mounting after the war.
As you may know, Denmark participated in the war against Iraq. This has
lead to an increasing pressure on the danish government as the evidence
of WMDs - and thus the reason to go to war - evaporates. Now there's talk
of public inquiries into the war.
The following articles were printed in Ekstra Bladet, the second largest
daily newspaper thursday, june 19, 2003.
The pictures of dead children mentioned in the articles can be found at
thememoryhole.org. (

THESE ARE YOUR DEAD CHILDREN, PRIME MINISTER
Shaken primeminister tries to evade weapons lies and bombed children: 'The
war is justified'
Ekstra Bladet does what apparantly no one else dares: We confront prime
minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen with the direct result of his, Bushs and
Blairs war on Iraq: Dead children.
  One of the pictures show a boy that has been horribly burned by
coalition bombs. Another picture is a close up of a boy who's head has
been blown to pieces.
  Two innocent children. Killed in a war based on a lie about weapons of
mass destruction. Conservative estimates say that at leas 5.500 civilians
died in the war. Others speak of up  to 10.000 killed civilian iraqis.
  After a long, heated debate in the foreign policy select comittee, where
primeminister Anders Fogh Rasmussen and foreignminister Per Stig Moeller
tried to justify the reasons for danish participation in the war and
talked about UN-mandate and international law, Ekstra Bladet asked the
  -- What is your opinion about the picture of the boy, who's head has
been blown of?
  'War is terrible', said primeminister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, visibly
shaken by the horror of the brutally killed iraqi boy.
  -- How do you feel about how the reason for war is obviously very thin,
yet it ended with  little children like this boy having their brains blown
  'I think, that if your paper is going to bring pictures like these, then
it should bring other pictures too, the pictures of mass graves, showing
how Saddam Husseins regime murdered thousands of people. You should bring
those pictures too.'
  -- But these are YOUR dead children?
  'Yes, but now its interesting to see if you're going to show the
pictures of mass graves at the same time so the readers can have a fair
and balanced picture of, how horrible it is.'
THE WEAPONS ARE THERE
  In spite of the large civilian losses, in spite of how no weapons of
mass destruction has been uncovered in Iraq and in spite of how inquiries
have been launched both in the US and in UK, prime minister Anders Fogh
Rasmussen still has no doubts about the war.
  -- What you're discussing today is that you - both you and the foreign
minister - on several occasions, both in public and in the parliament has
declared with great certainty, that there were weapons of mass
destruction. Have you deceived the people and the parliament?
  'But listen! No! Certainly not! And I'd like to say, that it hasn't been
proved that they're not there. They just haven't been found yet.'
  'Everything shows that of course he had those weapons. They must be some
  -- You have no doubts about that?
  'Where in the world should they be, if he hasn't declared them?', says
the danish prime minister before he ends the interview and hurriedly
leaves the scene.
FOREIGN MINISTER
ON SLIPPERY ICE
'The evidence should be able to stand in court', the danish foreign
minister Per Stig Moeller said on september 6 last year.
  Today his demands of legally solid evidence against Iraq is completely
  'At no time did we say that we with certainty knew that he had those
weapons. What we said was that he had the threat of having the weapons.
He has used that threat to destabilize the entire region', says foreign
minister Per Stig Moeller today.
  -- But you said that the government was sure that Saddam Hussein had
weapons of mass destruction?
  'Not me. I haven't said that. I'm pretty sure I have said 'alleged
weapons of mass destruction'...'
  -- But Fogh said last september he had no doubts that Iraq had weapons
of mass destruction?
  'Well, yes. But you should talk to primeminister Anders Fogh Rasmussen
about that.'
  -- Are you rejecting what the prime minister said?
  'No! But you're interrupting me. See, now you interrupted me.'
  -- But today it suddently does'nt matter to you at all, whether Saddam
had those weapons of mass destruction?
  'Yes, you might say that. The important thing is that he used it as a
threat to the international society. And that he couldn't declare that he
had destroyed it. It was Saddam who needed to prove that he didn't have
it. That's what UN said all along.'
WHAT THEY SAID BEFORE THE WAR
Eight times in the same speach the foreign minister Per Stig Moeller on
march 21 said that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. This is what he
  'You have to go in with military force to remove Saddam Hussein and his
weapons of mass desctruction.'
  'He has hidden those weapons of mass destruction.'
  'You have to take the consequences and remove his weapons of mass
  'All aspects of the weapons of mass destruction programs should be laid
clear and the weapons destroyed. The same thing goes for the missiles.'
  'Then Saddam Hussein will sit there with his weapons of
  'This is a fight with Saddam Hussein because of his weapons.'
  'We all want to disarm him of his weapons of mass destruction.'
  'I'd like to thank for two days of long debates, where we have discussed
every element in  connection with participation in the fight with Saddam
Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction.'
  September 6 the danish foreign minister Per Stig Moeller said:
  'The evidence should be able to stand in court.'
  The same month the danish prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen said:
  'I hold no doubt at all that he has weapons of mass destruction and that
he wants to produce them.'
THEY DECEIVED BOTH PEOPLE AND PARLIAMENT
In the middle of the long and heated debate about the Iraq war, MP Keld
Albrechtsen left the meeting to relieve himself. He was so shaken that he
completely forgot to go to the bathroom.
  'I can't get prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen and foreign minister
Per Stig Moeller to understand that they have deceived both the
parliament and the people', Keld Albrechtsen told the press outside the
meeting room.
  'They simply don't understand. But then we'll have to work for getting a
thorough inquiry which has to find out whether the government has
misguided or deceived the people. Something along the lines of what's
starting in the US.'
  'It has to be with the possibility of interrogating civil servants so we
can find out whether they knowingly deceived us and what stake the
intelligence services has in this', Keld Albrechtsen of the Unity Party
said before hastening in to the meeting again.
  MP Villy Soevndahl of the Socialist Peoples Party also wants an
independent inquiry while the socialdemocratic MP Jeppe Kofod talked
about a declaration from the government while keeping an eye on the
revelations in USA and UK.
  'Lets see what happens, then we can find out what to do about it here',
Kofod said.
