       sex [options] ...  [username] ...
       sex allows the invoker to have sex with the user(s) speci-
       fied in the command line.  If no users are specified, they
       are  taken  from the LOVERS environment variable.  Options
       to make things more interesting are as follows:
       -1     masturbate
       -a     external stimulus (aphrodisiac) option
       -b     buggery
       -B animal
              bestiality with animal

       -f     foreplay option
       -F     nasal sex with plants
       -i     coitus interruptus (messy!)

       -l     leather option
       -m     masochism (see -s)
       -M     triple parallel (Menage a Trois) option

              kills it)
       -o     oral option
       -O     parallel access (orgy)
       -p     debug option (proposition only)
                                                                1
       -m     masochism (see -s)
       -M     triple parallel (Menage a Trois) option

       -q     quickie (wham, bam, thank you, ma'am)
       -s     sadism (target must set -m)
       -S     sundae option
       -v     voyeurism (surveys the entire net)

       LOVERS is a list of default partners which will be used if
              none are specified in the command line.  If any are
              specified, the values in LOVERS is ignored.
       /usr/lib/sex/animals
              animals for bestiality
       /usr/lib/sex/blackbook
              possible dates
       /usr/lib/sex/sundaes
              sundae recipes
       /usr/lib/sex/s&m
              sado-masochistic equipment
       ^C     (quit process) may leave the user very unsatisfied.
       ^Z     (stop process) is usually quite messy.
       Oldest program ever.

You mean one machine with dual processors? You can't run two operating
systems concurrently on an SMP machine. You can install two operating
systems and choose which one to run, of course. This is complicated by the fact that there are several FAQs in that
directory. One, combined, is 100K. Juno has a message limit of around 64K,
meaning that the FAQ would have to be split, and I don't know what the
upper limit is on the size of a mailspool at Juno. My suggestion is to sneak into a public university computer lab, sit down
at a machine then FTP it and put it on a floppy. Most of the people in
these labs don't ask questions because getting carded tends to really tick
the students off. If they do, say you left your ID card in your car, that
you're very sorry, that you usually don't get asked for it when you walk
in, that you're taking  class, that you only need about 5 minutes of time, and that you'll
remember it next time.
