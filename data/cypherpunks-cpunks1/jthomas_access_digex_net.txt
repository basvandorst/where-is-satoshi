@_subject: REMAIL: problems 
I've thought about this as well.  I don't think it's right to _ever_ keep
return path information in a cypherpunk remailer, even for error reporting.
Far better to just drop the message on the floor than provide a loophole
to the anonymity of the system.
That said, I think there are possible solutions to the problem of
vanishing remailers.  Let's say there is a method to quickly and easily
verify the continuing existance (or lack thereof) of a remailer.  When a
remailer receives a request to send a message to another remailer, it can
quickly check to see if that remailer is in operation.  The question is
what to do with the information if it turns out the remailer is really down.
If the message is unencrypted, a smart remailer could simply skip the
missing remailer or send the message on to a substitute remailer, which
would then pass the message down the chain.
But if the message is encrypted with each remailer's key, it is
undeliverable without that remailer to decrypt it.  My idea is for
remailers to share their private keys using a secret-sharing protocol. When a remailer goes down, all the other remailers that hold pieces of its
key would choose a replacement remailer and send it the key pieces.  From
then on, all mail for the missing remailer would be routed instead to its
replacement remailer, which would decrypt and process it as usual.
It would be quite a pain to implement, but would make large remailer nets
a lot more reliable if it's done right.

@_subject: tripple des 
In fact, "triple" DES goes three times through the engine, but only uses
two keys:
     EN(DE(EN(data,k1),k2),k1)
My understanding is that this was chosen for hardware implementations
because it is equivalent to single DES when k1 = k2.  This is important,
of course, when some people you want to talk to are still using single DES
and the hardware is hard to reconfigure.
Nowadays, when most DES (technically, DEA) is done in software, it would
make more sense to use three separate keys.  Two key "triple" DES has 112
key bits (56 * 2), while a three key system would have 168.  I've seen the
latter system used recently, though I can't remember where...

@_subject: archiving on inet 
Several variations on this analogy have been posted, but I still don't see
how it applies to Usenet.
If HBO allowed anyone who could receive its signal to pass it along to
anyone else, without a prior license agreement, I would say it would have
little grounds for trying to prevent the sale of programs taped off HBO.
But to attempt to bring this back from misc.legal to cypherpunks territory...
Have people here thought about what happens to the concept of intellectual
property in an environment of strong cryptography and cheap anonymity? When there's no way for the government to enforce Berne on movies and
electronic books, what hope is there for Usenet postings?

@_subject: The Death of Statutory Compensation for Intellectual Property (was pissing contest) 
Here's my slant on it:
Without government coercion, "intellectual property" is limited to its
only natural form -- a secret.  If you don't want everyone to have certain
information, don't tell anyone.  At the very least, don't tell anyone who
has no incentive to keep the information to himself.

Is this really a settled issue?  I'll bet I could devise a scheme for
tagging a large number of copies of an image, such that the information
available to a cheater from two images isn't enough to produce an
untraceable copy.  Such a scheme would entail some image degradation -- if
you didn't mess with some visible bits in each picture, a cheater would
only have to randomize all the "invisible" bits.
But of course this stuff is only useful if the work is distributed
non-anonymously in the first place.  It doesn't do QVC/Paramount much good
to know that an2538295 was the one responsible for redistributing 10,000
copies of Star Trek L.
Computer software and other interactive works should fare better, since
the publishers can restrict their distribution to secure machines on a
network.  Customers would pay to use the software, but never receive a copy of
their own.  Reverse-engineering even "Dragon's Lair"-type games would be
non-trivial and error-prone.  And after getting ripped off for a bad
interactive copy, most people would probably be happy to pay a premium for
the real thing.

@_subject: NSA museum now open, if you can find it 
A long article from today's paper -- I hope nobody minds the length.
Only Sleuths Can Find This Museum
By Ken Ringle
Washington Post Staff Writer
In the shadowy world of U.S. intelligence agencies, the National Security
Agency has always been the most clandestine of all.
Some 20,000 people work at the mirror-windowed complex at Fort Meade south
of Baltimore-Washington International Airport, but until 1989 there wasn't
even a sign in front of the buildings.  The 1952 executive order that
created the agency was itself classified.  For years it was a federal
crime even to say it existed.
Next to the NSA, the CIA is Geraldo Rivera.
Therefore, as might be expected, when the NSA opened its own museum
recently, it did things a little differently.  It held the first opening
in July and didn't tell the public.  It held a second ribbon-cutting last
month for the public but didn't tell the press.  (Officials reportedly
worried that news photos might de-anonymize some NSA cryptographer snapped
nosing around the exhibits.)
When a reporter heard of the museum recently from a source close to the
NSA, he was able to locate it only after an extended series of calls to
the agency, all fielded by people answering with their telephone extension
number and who, when asked for a given person, would reply firmly the "the
name does not compute" or "we do not provide directory assistance."
"People tend to be a bit sensitive around here," said Stephen J.
McAnallen, a surprisingly good natured man finally located under the
oxymoronic title of NSA public affairs officer.  "It sort of comes with
the territory."
With McAnallen's help, the National Cryptologic Museum was ultimately
discovered in a defunct motel at the end of a crumbling road behind a
Shell station just off Route 32 from the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.  It
would be a highly anonymous location were it not surrounded by a high
chain-link fence with barbed wire on top.
The museum is the latest step in the gradual demythologizing of the agency

Minor quibble:  It might be better to say that you'll probably *have* one if you take 2**64 random samples.  Finding the pair would be pretty hard, and you'd need a lot of storage in the meantime.

This seems like an appropriate time to give a plug to the Extropians list software.  If I remember correctly, there was a ::nosend command that people could use when forwarding long messages.  The ::nosend command
would cause the list processor to file the whole message in the archives, and only send out a pointer to it (a title in the index?).  Those who wanted to retrieve the message could send a command to the list processor, requesting it.
I don't know if Majordomo has anything similar...

Sure.  Stay jacked-in full time.
Seriously, communications costs are dropping so fast, I'm not sure why
you'd put much effort into designing a bulletproof offline system.  Even with today's technology, a shopkeeper could just have a $17.50/mo. Netcom account and run his Magic Money client whenever someone wanted to pay with bits.  Certainly no more expensive than a credit card Verifone.
But this question comes up often enough that I'm afraid I'm missing something.  Why would offline systems be more useful?

@_subject: Nom de guerre public key 
I probably ought to get out of lurk mode here, since my signature can be found on the key of one of the more prominent pseudonyms on the list, Black Unicorn.  I met Uni briefly at one of the (two) D.C. area cypherpunks meetings, last spring.  I didn't check his ID.  For all his reluctance to give his name here, he did, as I recall, attempt to give it at at the meeting.  (Pat Farrell was trying to draw a seating chart so we'd know what to call each other, but he had trouble spelling Uni's I guess it could have been an impostor at the meeting, but enough of the details seemed to match up that I didn't have any doubts about him.  And I've probably got enough information from his posts, and my hazy recollection of his first name, to find out who he is, if I felt like it.
I guess my point is that key signing doesn't always fit into one particular category, one that requires a drivers license or passport.  That (or personal knowledge of the person) is the most secure method for keys that are clearly bound to a specific person, but it's not the only way things are done.

Another thought:  why couldn't you sell a book of "stamps" -- Magic Money tokens -- and get paid for them using First Virtual?  This would get around two problems:  the lack of anonymity using First Virtual, and the fairly high 29-cent-per-transaction fee.  You could sell a book of twenty remailer stamps for a dollar, or something.  I'd buy.
And it wouldn't make it too easy for people to use remailers without paying.  FV will still take an account away from someone who denies legitimate charges too many times.
I guess there is the problem of Chaum's patents (and RSA's).  Is there anyplace where neither set of patents is valid, or where they'd be practically unenforceable?
