Greating and salutations
 I need this document translated, and the translation is to be of high quality. The attorney asked me to be especially careful with page 2. As I need to submit the document tomorrow, please have it checked and translated for me today.
 I have deposited $150 to your credit card account that you gave me the last time. Let me know if any questions occur.
 P.S. The document is in the ZIP-compressed MS Word file attached to this message. I look forward to getting the result ASAP.
Let's keep in touch
Maggie Hathaway
