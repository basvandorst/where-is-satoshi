On the importance of anonymity (in regards to the whistleblower
Last week, the Houston Chronicle ran two or three articles on how ill
run the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is.  Specifically, the article
described how one or two people had their careers absolutely ruined by
raising safety concerns at nuclear plants.  In each case, the
employees involved were terminated shortly after citing safety hazards
(such as spills left uncleaned on table tops, etc.)  Someone quoted in
the article stated this behavior undoubtedly scares off other
potential informers.
Plus, I read an article in the Chronicle about how a NASA employee was
fired for his political beliefs.  Well, it is more complicated: the
employee actively participated in some usenet group
(talk.politics.china?), and had a store of back articles on his
computer at work, which his superiors discovered.  Shortly thereafter,
he lost his job.
I've been busy of late and could kick myself for not saving these
papers, because real world incidents such as these strengthen our
arguments for privacy and anonymity.  Some people have such an
irritating tendency to assume irresponsibility and abuse when a
freedom becomes available - just read news.admin.policy.

@_subject: "Cypherpunks Write Code" 
Heh, lots of stuff could be done:
1) Hack around with the anonymous remailers.  Eric mentioned he is
working on a "second generation" remailer which allows users to
specify cut marks, etc.  I've been fooling with one that caches all
incoming messages in a directory, and then at midnight (by using the
at command) mails/routes each messages on its way.  Still got problems
with it, though...
2) DC Nets.  Yanek Martinson is working on a DC Net implementation
using email.  A TCP/IP version would be nice!
3) CELP.  Don't know much about this other that porting it and hand
coding parts in assembly for speed would be welcome.  Then, we could
have our own encrypted conversations.
4) Digital Bank.  A full-blown implementation (RSA encryption and
decryption, blinded messages, etc).  I have written a scaled down
digital bank which provides privacy and security by using random cash
and random account numbers, and does not correlate account numbers
with usernames.  It's written in the Korn shell, and I plan many
improvements once the semester is over (rewrite in PERL for one...)
But my bank does not implement Chaum's digicash scheme, and that would
be best.
5) Once that is done, we can experiment with a "cash accepting"
remailer - one that will only remail if valid digicash is included in
the header, or whatever.  Then, such a system may be expanded to do
anonymous or pseudonymous usenet posting, which may be an acceptible
(to folks who are vehemently against anonymous posting, etc.) solution
to helping prevent abuse by such services.
6) Steganography, hiding code in other documents.  For example, hiding
each bit of a message (encrypted or not) in the low order bits of an
image, gif, tiff, whatever.  I've played around with the tiff format
and will try to use Sam Lieffler's (sp?) tiff package to help out.
Writing a program that will automatically embed a message in a picture
and read a message out will be useful.  ("hey everyone, be sure to get
the denning.gif from alt.binaries.pictures.misc and read my comments
about the clipper chip!")
7) Misc stuff.  Check out the scripts which help in the use of the
anonymous remailers - they are for UNIX and DOS.  Amiga, Mac, etc.
versions needed.
8) Take your favorite unix utility (mail for example) or whatever and
add encryption automatically.  Sure, using it on a multi-user systems
may not be the best thing to do, but the code, techniques, and
solutions would be of value and would aid others.
9) probably lots of other stuff that would be nice...

@_subject: RADIO: keys, ham, and subliminal channels 
Hmm... if authenticating signatures can be transmitted, then some
enterprising and patient cryptographers can also transmit messages,
encrypted if desired, back and forth using one of the "subliminal
channel" protocols!
A subliminal channel allows people to communicate by essentially
disguising their true message in the digital signature of the message
they transmit openly.  It would take several exchanges between the two
to transmit a real message, since I recall the subliminal channels
I've looked at allow the transfer of a few numbers at a time, but it
could be done!

This could very well be.  An associate of mine :-) discovered that
anonymous posts made via remailers concerning the student suspension
at UH (traffic on comp.admin.policy and alt.comp.acad-freedom.talk a
few weeks ago) stopped showing quite suddenly.
On the other hand, be advised that the gateway at UTexas doesn't post
to all groups - I tried posting to alt.security once, only to have the
post returned to me with a note "group renamed to comp.security.misc".
So if anonymous posts are filtered - how is it being done?  If it is
something simple like refusing posts from a username of nobody then
that can be fixed easily enough.  But it may block posts by taking
addresses from the list of remailers.

also publish Salomaa's _Public Key Cryptography_); ISBN 0-387-97930-1
and 3-540-97930-1.
The book describes the differential cryptanalysis attack, which is
also applicable to "bounded-round versions" of certain other
cryptosystems [what is a "bounded-round version" anyway?].  Phil
Zimmerman is acknowledged in the Preface [could this be the same prz
of PGP?]
I haven't had a chance to read the book - I've just been flipping
around so far, but here are the chapters:
1	Introduction
2	Results
3	Introduction to Differential Cryptanalysis
4	Differential Cryptanalysis of DES Variants
5	Differential Cryptanalysis of the Full 16-Round DES

Unfortunately, I can't erase the syslog file or turn sendmail logging
Some things that would help foil traffic analysis would be to file all
incoming mail in a directory, and then mail it out randomly in the
early hours of the morning.  Or, hop your mail around a bit more.
Ah, I have some bad and good news about my remailer
elee7h5 at rosebud.ee.uh.edu.  A friend has loaned me his account, and in
the course of setting up a remailer which uses RIPEM instead of PGP
(some folks have requested this - and it should be up RSN :-), I tried
to log into my account to fix the sendmail invocation option to -oi
and recompile perl to include flock() support.  I found my password
had been locked!
Actually, I've been expecting this to happen - you see, I'm through
with UH and am going to Rice from now on.  Rosebud is a workstation in
the grad group I used to be in, and since I'm no longer a student, I
figured this would happen sooner or later.  BUT, it is a precedent
that old student's directories are kept around, with logins disabled.
I've tested the remailer, and it still responds, so hopefully it will
run quietly for many more months/years :-)
That was the bad news: I can't log into it to fix things, or check
bounced mail, etc.  But this is good news as well: bounces and errors
are dropped, the remailer works automatically and I can't disable it
:-) In fact, I have a pretty good excuse if ever somebody "abuses" the
remailer... I can't do anything about it, heh :-)

@_subject: encrypting virus (KOH) 
Well, perhaps any discussion of viruses tends to cause feelings to run
high, so perhaps the author of potassium hydroxide shouldn't have
termed his program a virus.
I don't see any difference between Stacker 3.0 and its stacked disk
option that compresses files on a floppy and inserts a small
decompression routine there as well, and the encrypting "program" I
posted information on.  Well, besides the fact the Stacker compresses
and potassium hydroxide encrypts.
Well, if I were more proficient in assembly I might code an encrypting
Stacker program.  Perhaps you will take the public domain code,
disassemble it and improve it, elevating it from "virus" status.
Yes, this may be true, and applied to every program ever written, not
just "viruses".  Not to insult anybody, but if memory serves PGP had a bug which
destroyed files on hard drives.... why, even Microsoft's CHKDSK
program had a bug which could destroy a hard drive.
Modern software is complex and configurations uncountable.  Now I do
not advocate spreading viruses and damaging computer systems, but to
imply the only viruses harbor potential for damage is surely
I posted this because the purpose of the "virus" is to automatically
encrypt files, a goal that I understand some people on this list are
working on.  If anybody is interested in a copy, I can send it.  A
disassembly would be instructive, and would allow people to fine tune
the program, improve it, incorporate it into other projects, etc.

@_subject: encrypting virus (KOH) 
Since this doesn't have much to do with encryption or cypherpunks per
se, I am hesitant to respond.  Interested people may obtain the
software from me.
Perhaps I should have doctored the text included with the program I
received and termed it an automatic encryption program, which encrypts
your hard drive and floppies with your permission.  We would possibly
be spared some of the fears of viruses.
1) the program asks for permission before performing any action
2) perhaps the program should include the standard disclaimer that ALL
SOFTWARE INCLUDING COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE includes, usually in the
beginning of the documentation, or on a separate card.  You know, the
one that says essentially that the the authors are not omniscient,
cannot predict all circumstances the software shall be used under, and
thus disclaim any damages.  This warning is included in all the
commercial software I own.  Actually, the disclaimers simply say that
you use the software at your own risk, damages are disclaimed.  I have
yet to see software which attempts to explain all potential
ramifications of its use.  I very much doubt I would be using software
at all if I were to wait for such packages to appear.
3) the program does not do this, much like Stacker does not create
README files which explain that your disks are now compressed.  This
is left to the documentation that comes with the program, some
appearing in a booklet, some as a text file (this practice occurs in
every single commercial package I own)
Now, I realize that since the author chose to call his program the
"potassium hydroxide virus" that alarm bells sound.  Maybe he should
have posted the source to this list, describing it as a CryptoStacker
program, which after installation encrypts floppy disks after
Why, the whole thing would be so much better if MSDOS could run
background processes - he could have written it to work like a unix
As I said before, I posted this since I know some people are working
on a similar program and may be interested in one which purports to do
all this.  Interested people may obtain the program, hex debug, and
read.me file from me.  I don't have the source code but maybe I can
contact the author and ask for it.  I don't have the tools or
expertise in assembly to do the disassembly myself.

@_subject: encrypting virus (KOH) 
Well maybe things were updated since I bought my copy of Stacker 2.0.
A stacker.log file is created, but it only logs errors during the
screate process.  No mention of compression is made.  If everything
went well, the log file contains no information, except headers and
empty lists.
But then I never stack floppies because I want to be able to use them
wherever I go, something Stacker 2.0 can't do, but Stacker 3.0 does.
I wonder if the author of KOH made this same decision: to insert
decrypting code on the floppy so you aren't tied to using one
computer, or to not "invade" a floppy so you are stuck using one

Out of curiosity, what are the approximate computer ratios among this

many Amigas, many have Unix, how many have VMS?  I'm just curious because it recently struck me that not everyone here

in C++ for MSDOS, but after looking at the code, I've decided to bury
it and replace it with the following MSDOS script (at bottom of this

Cypherpunks, this is an experiment we can try right here right now.
We certainly have the anonymous mail facilities, pools, and
encryption, as well as a digital bank we could use to "pay" people :-)
Splitting a decryption key is fairly easy: we could use the simple XOR
method.  Say you want to encrypt a message of length m and split the
key among n people.  Choose n-1 sequences of m random bits (coin
flips, cryptographically strong pseudo-random number sequences, etc)
and XOR the message with all the random sequences (call the result
M').  Then your split secret is the M' and the n-1 sequences.  To
recover the message, calculate the XOR of M' and the n-1 sequences.
Providing for an n-out-of-m scheme takes more work and number theory,
but that can be done as well.

Forty years ago cryptography wasn't even popular with mathematicians.

always popular since it the [sic] NSA is the villain.  There's the
public key issue - RSA Inc. expressing concern over the public good,

At long last I beleive a working version of hopmail written in the
MSDOS scripting is finished.  I've tested it and it seems to work (and
I even sent messages with DOS CRLF's instead of unix NL and had no
problems), but if you find problems let me know.  I'm assuming you are
like me in that my pc doesn't have a dedicated net connection, so the
scripts just prepare file, but don't mail them.  You would upload the
file to your network account and go from there.
Warning: the code is ugly, but I plead innocence, citing the
constraints of the language!  I've never used so many goto's since my
last BASIC program ~11 years ago.
I think in the future I'll just write DOS stuff in C/C++, with system
calls, and offer source with executables, so you can recompile if
you've think I've added secret password catching commands :-)  I'd use
4DOS and other enhancements like some people have suggested (thanks!)
but I want to be sure as many people as possible can use the script,
so using just plain old DOS seems the best way to go.  Well, the best
way to go in DOS.
I'll write a help file and offer it, the script, and anonmail.bat up
for ftp.  Quickly, because getting input from the user in DOS is a
real pain/impossible without resorting to extra programs/assembly
hacks , all parameters are just entered on the command line.  Type
hopmail and a short help screen will appear.
Now I'll clean up the digital bank and circulate the source to those
interested. ---------8< -- cut here -- >8----------

That's right, because each remailer attempts to discard as much of the
header as possible.  Otherwise it wouldn't be anonymous - if I were to
send a message to you through rosebud and the headers showed the path
from me to rosebud and rosebud to you, you'd know where the message
really came from!
So the header of an anonymously mailed message should make it look
like the message originated from the last hop.

This double & unexpected message problem reminds me of the problems I
had when I attempted to chain pax and penet together.  But that

unexpected userid occured, then it would show in the message to
cypherpunks from penet, assuming an5877 would say that that isn't his
normal pseudonym.
penet to send to this list, that someone will be allocated a penet id,
and allocation will be sent back to the original sender.  Then, mail
to penet with the remailing request to this list will show up as
originating from the pseudonym established.  So how in the world is
Chael's remailer getting hold of the messages and forwarding them to
this list?
I know a few times in the past I've received mail addressed to me and
the list (cc: cypherpunks at toad.com) and I've replied without noticing
the cc: header, so my reply showed up in both places (now I try to
look for the carbon copy header and delete it out!).  But an5877 says
that the header only contains the header he specified.
Now Chael wrote the remailer software himself (is this true?) and I
think he said there were several remailing request specifiers, one of
which is X-Anon-To: user at host - the same one penet uses.
So maybe an5877 is replying to messages with this header:
X-Anon-To: cypherpunks at toad.com
(If the header were this obvious, then I'm sure an5877 would catch it.
But sometimes extra stuff shows in the header, like message id's, etc.
so the cc: is hidden a bit)  Then, the nowhere remailer would
dutifully resend the message as instructed in the X-Anon-To: header.
Of course, to get the cc: nowhere at bsu in the header in the first place
would indicate that an5877 did try to use it at some point - for the
original message?
Well, its a bit far-fetched, but it does explain what is going on.

@_subject: STEG: subliminal messages 
An interesting related topic is subliminal channels and messages.  A
subliminal channel is one in which communication takes place without
an external observer realizing it.
The classic example is communication between two prisoners (I guess
they played the prisoner's dilemma and both wound up in jail anyway).
Two prisoners are allowed to communicate, but the warden is suspicious
so he intercepts all traffic, reads it, and then passes it on.  The
prisoners demand that they be able to digitally sign messages to
prevent forgeries by the warden.  The warden demands he be able to
read the messages (no PGP).  All parties agree to these terms and the
communication begins.
Basically, the prisoners communicate in the open (the message readable
by the warden) but they also communicate with a "subliminal channel"
the warden isn't aware of: the digital signature.  The prisoners sign
their messages in such a way as to communicate a few bits of
information with each message passed along.  The digital signatures
can be verified, so the warden suspects nothing.  Eventually, the
prisoners work out their stories and are released.  :-)
As I remember, and I don't have the book here with me now, Seberry and
Peipryzk's book describes this, and gives several examples of
subliminal channel algorithms, of which I only recall El Gamal`s at
the moment.  Perhaps Arto Salaama's "Public Key Cryptography" contains
more information.

@_subject: subliminal messages 
Eric Hughes just told me some extremely interesting information
concerning subliminal channels and the DSS.  Apparently, the DSS is
very hospitable towards subliminal channels.  (I won't summarize
further since Eric may have posted to the list).
Again: a subliminal channel is a channel in which an external observer
is unaware of communication.  For example, two prisoners want to
communicate.  The warden agrees if the messages are plaintext.  The
prisoners agree if they can authenticate (digitally sign) the messages
- - after all, the warden may try to spoof them.  The warden agrees to
this arrangement (for instance, after reading up on digital signatures
in Denning's book, which doesn't cover subliminal channels!), allowing
the prisoners to embed their true communication in the digital
signature of their plaintext messages.
Before showing an example El Gamal subliminal channel, I'll briefly
describe El Gamal's authentication scheme (since most people are
familiar with or have heard of the RSA method only).  In El Gamal's
scheme (from Seberry and Pieprzyk's "Cryptography: an Introduction to
Computer Security"):
1) Alice chooses p a prime, g a primitive element of GF(p), r a random
   integer.  Loosely, g (being primitive) can be used to generate the
   rest of the field GF(p) by exponentiation.
2) Alice calculates K = g^r mod p
   Alice publishes (K,g,p) as the public key
3) a message M is authenticated by first choosing a second random
   integer r' such that r' and p-1 are relatively prime
   Alice computes X = g^r' mod p
   Alice solves M = rX + r'Y mod p-1 for Y
   Alice sends (M,X,Y) to B and keeps (r,r') secret
4) Bob can verify the message M by calculating A = K^X X^Y mod p and
   only accepts the message as authentic if and only if A = g^M mod p
The example in the book is (I'm not sitting at a NeXT at the moment,
the only place it's convenient for me to use Mathematica, or I'd use
some larger numbers):
Alice chooses p = 11, g = 2, r = 8
Alice computes K = g^r mod p = 2^8 mod 11 = 3
Thus (K,g,p) = (3,2,11)
Say the message is M = 5
Alice chooses r' = 9.  GCD(r',p-1) = 1, so they are relatively prime
Alice computes X = g^r' mod p = 2^9 mod 11 = 6
Alice solves M = rX + r'Y mod p-1 for Y
             5 = 8*6 + 9*Y mod 10; yeilding Y = 3
Alice sends out the triple (M,X,Y) = (5,6,3) to Bob.
Note: M can be read.
Bob now has (M,X,Y) = (5,6,3) and the public key (K,g,p) = (3,2,11)
Bob calculates A = K^X X^Y mod p = 3^6 6^3 mod 11 = 10
Bob calculates g^M mod p = 2^5 mod 11 = 10
So, since A = 10 and g^M mod p = 10, the message is valid.
Again, when I have a chance I'll plug in much larger numbers so you
don't think it all works out by coincidence.
In the El Gamal subliminal channel, somehow the random integer r is
known by both parties.  So Alice and Bob agree on a random r before
they ever find themselves in the position of using a subliminal
channel.  1) Alice chooses p, g as before.  She chooses the r that she and Bob
   share.  She calculates K as before.
2) Alice calculates the subliminal message m, using a plaintext
   message M, by calculating X = g^m and solving the following equation
   for Y: M = rX + mY mod (p-1)
3) Alice send (M,X,Y) to Bob.
4) Bob receives (M,X,Y) and knows (p,g) which are public and the
   secret r he shares with Alice.
5) Bob calculates A = (g^r)^X X^Y mod p and accepts the message M as
   authentic if A = g^M mod p (as before in El Gamal authentication).
6) Now Bob extracts the subliminal message by computing
   m = Y^-1 (M - rX) mod (p-1)
As before, (K,g,p) = (3,2,11) is public.  r = 8 is the shared secret.
Alice wants to send m = 9, using the plaintext message M = 5
Alice computes X = g^m mod p = 2^9 mod 11 = 6
Alice solves 5 = 8*6 9Y mod 10 for Y; Y = 3
Alice sends (M,X,Y) = (5,6,3) to Bob.
Bob computes A = (2^8)^6 6^3 mod 11 = 10
Bob computes g^M mod p = 2^5 mod 11 = 10
These are equal, so Bob accepts the message.
Now, he extracts the subliminal message: m = Y^-1 (M - rX) mod (p-1)
  = 3^-1 (5 - 8*6) mod 10 = 9.
So, it is possible to communicate information with subliminal
channels.  A real life example where this could occur is with ham
radio operators.  Encrypted messages are illegal, but checksum message
can be transmitted, so the checksum can be modified to include a
subliminal message.  I'm just pointing this out for theoretical
interest - I know it's illegal!
Now, back to subliminal messages and the DSS.  Suppose the government
decides to authenticate the information on your driver's license with
DSS.  All sorts of information can be included subliminally, such as
an arrest record, number of speeding tickets, if the person in
question is suspicious, etc...

He mentioned his friend is getting abusive mail, probably from telnet to

who would harrass and abuse others."  Wait a second... here is an
example of harrassment right now, without anything to do with the

just wait patiently until someone leaves their machine for a few seconds

I guess I'm one of those people who would get upset and blame the person
responsible for the action instead of software and/or technological
advancement for possible providing a means.
As Peter mentioned, payphones are already perfect for harrassment.  So
is junk mail... and the crucial thing here is these services cost money.
I'm sure future remailers will incorporate digital cash and be a
pay-for-each-remail service.
Chris also mentions concers about distributing porn and stuff like that
through remailers.  I guess this could be done, but why give up the
speed and convenience of ftp, fsp, irc (dcc), and usenet posting?  These
services distribute files faster and further than remailing.

would first purchase some postage stamps, certificates, however you
want to think of it.  Then, you attach the cash/stamp/certificate to
the mail (maybe by a special header field), and send it to the
remailer.  Your mail would probably be encrypted as well to keep
others from spying on your cash, altering it (rendering it invalid)
and using it for themselves.  The remailer would validate your cash,
probably store it in a file to prevent multiple uses, and then forward
your mail to wherever.
The digital cash part just means electronic forms of payment which
have cash properties.  Say you purchase something with cash.  The
merchant can't link your identity to the cash, and later when the
merchant deposits cash in a bank, the bank cannot link the cash to
your transactions with the merchant.  But the merchant can verify the
cash is valid, and the bank can too.  Furthermore, you can't spend the
same piece of cash twice.
This is confusing to think about without being familiar with modern
crypto; one of these days I shall finish a digital cash application
I've been working on for people to play with.

@_subject: STEG: subliminal messages 
[I'm forwarding mail from Eric which was meant for the list as well]
[summary deleted]
Gus Simmons has recently written a paper on subliminal channels in the
DSA (the one PKP is about to license).  The paper as of yet is not
officially published, but likely will be at Crypto '93 next month.
I've seen a copy of the paper, but don't have a copy.  I do, however, remember this one line. "The DSA provides the most
hospitable environment for subliminal channels in any system yet
seen." (Almost verbatim, but not quite.)  Assume this is true.  (I believe Simmons, myself.)  What might this
mean?  Suppose some agency of the government makes digital signatures
on some certificate for individuals.  To take a concrete example, take
driver's licenses.  The subliminal channel in the signature might be
used to encode, say, the following:
  1. number of drunk driving convictions
  2. number of drunk driving arrests
  3. insurance rating
  4. whether this person is suspected of habitually
    a. merchandising narcotics
    b. carrying large amounts of cash
    c. looking at child pornography
    d. wanting to kill police officers
    e. carrying concealed messages
Since the signature itself contains this information, and since the
channel is subliminal, the only way to know whether the channel
carries data is to see the software.
For this reason the DSA should not be used by government agencies to
make certificates for individuals.  It should be scrapped for this
purpose and some other algorithm designed which has a provable upper
bound on the subliminal channel of less than one bit.

Perhaps the government should quit selling these items to third world
I think it is a large factor.  It boils down to control.  I could get
my own domain from UUNET and ship megs of junk mail, but I'm probably
not going to do that since I would PAY for it all.  You think your
email is "free" since the associated cost is hidden in your school
Yeah, but the clues that a payphone call or junk mail leave are nearly
worthless.  I mean, I could do a "pot shot" attack on somebody, one
time only, and there is no way I could be tracked, unless I were
observed at the time.
Just curious, but what makes e-mail so different to you?  E-mail
reaches thousands of people all over the world, but so does postal
mail.  E-mail is usually quick, and so is a phone call.  Anonymous
mail is harder to trace to the sender; a phone call from a payphone is
harder to trace to the caller.
Is it the combination of these items?
These remailers are just experimental!
Sendmail activity is generally logged in the syslog file.  Anonymous
mailers make is more difficult to determine the true destination.
You would have to repeatedly use the same payphone or mailbox, to
leave tangible clues

@_subject: HELP: pgp, .forward, mh 
Situation: I'd like mail that arrives at my other account to be
encrypted and then forwarded to this account.  I have spent a few
hours trying various things and nothing seems to work.
I've tried this as my .forward file:
"| /myhome/pgp -fea barrus | mail elee9sf at menudo.uh.edu"
but all that arrives at elee9sf is a blank message.
I've tried
"| /myhome/remail.script"
where remail.script was a one-liner similar to the above.  Nothing.
Any suggestions?  Note:
1) barrus at tree.egr.uh.edu is a NeXT account.  Is NeXTSTEP just too
different for this stuff to work?
2) I'm running pgp2.1 on tree.egr, and don't have the old docs
anymore.  Was the -f option not present?
3) Anybody have a makefile for NeXT so I can upgrade?  I compiled 2.1
by hand editing some lines, but the task looks pretty daunting with
2.2.  I tried 'make mach' but that didn't get very far.
So, if that's impossible, how do I get my elee9sf account to do it?  I
use mh on menudo, and have tried
to barrus at tree.egr.uh.edu | A "/path/pgp -fea barrus | /path/rvcstore +tonext"
in my .maildelivery but that doesn't seem to fly either.  Any suggestions?

@_subject: THANKS: pgp, mh, .forward 
Thanks Hal, Stanton, Miron - I finally got it to work, on the menudo
side, not the NeXT.
I don't know what the deal is with the NeXT; 'cat .plan | myscript'
worked (myscript had all the necessary stuff) but having this .forward
file didn't: "|/bigpath/barrus/myscript"
But, I got it to work from menudo with this in my .maildelivery file:
to "barrus at tree.egr.uh.edu" | A "PGPPATH=/fajitas/elee9sf/Crypto/pgp22 /fajitas/elee9sf/bin/pgp -fea barrus | /usr/lib/mh/rcvstore +fromnext"
Mail sent to barrus at tree.egr.uh.edu gets piped through pgp, encrypted,
and then stored in the mail folder 'fromnext'.  The PGPPATH did seem
to be the missing factor!
Now, for those who wonder why in the world I'd want to do this... I've
been involved in a quasi-flame session on USENET (in comp.admin.policy
and other cross-posted groups) concerning a student who was suspended
here.  My posts became more and more sarcastic, and as I was
contemplating sending out a post which may have been on the edge, and
not wanting to make the sh*tlist here - or get higher up on it :-) - I
was going to route it through penet from my tree account.  But then
responses to the post would have eventually been dropped here on
menudo, since I have my mail forwarded.  Now I'm not suggesting that
the admins here are watching my mail, but it wouldn't be difficult for
the admins to do some traffic analysis (crypto sophistication!),
noting that Karl's mail file grows coincident in time and size to
responses to XYZ post... enter encryption!  So it would be better to
get the encryption going on the NeXT side, but this solution is good
enough for me.  Final note: I forgot penet is restricting posts for
the time being, but in any event this system is working.)

@_author: elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU 
@_subject: INFO: .forward 
Well, I'll give it a shot.  Sendmail optionally reads a file in your
home directory named .forward, and follows the instructions there.
Typically, a .forward contains another address, in which case mail
sent gets forwards to the address in the .forward file.  For example,
my .forward file on tree.egr.uh.edu is
elee9sf at menudo.uh.edu
so any mail sent to barrus at tree.egr.uh.edu gets forwarded to
elee9sf at menudo.uh.edu.
A more interesting application is to forward your mail to a command
(pipe mail to a command).  In that case, the .forward file reads
"|/path/mycommand options"
and mail gets piped to mycommand for further processing.  For
instance, the vacation program works by piping incoming mail to
vacation, which both files and responds for you.  Also, the cypherpunk
remailers work by using a .forward file to pipe incoming mail to the
scripts which make up the remailer.  Yet another example is the slocal
program which is part of the mh mail system; incoming mail gets piped
to slocal, which in turn relies on a configuration file
(.maildelivery) which contains instructions for handling the mail.
My idea was to have all mail sent to barrus at tree.egr.uh.edu piped
through pgp and then mailed to elee9sf at menudo.uh.edu.  The rough idea
is to do this:
"|/path/pgp -fea barrus | mail elee9sf at menudo.uh.edu"
Here, incoming mail gets piped to 'pgp -fea barrus' which encrypts the
message with my public key, and the result is piped to 'mail
elee9sf at menudo.uh.edu' which then mails the encrypted result to me.
For various reasons I'm still exploring, this didn't work (even with
PGPPATH set, piping to a script, etc.  I've got more things to try to
see why it isn't working.) on the NeXT.
So, I tried to do this from the menudo.uh.edu side.  Using the slocal
program and the associated .maildelivery file, I have mail which comes
from barrus (remember my mail from tree is forwarded
to menudo) piped through 'pgp -fea barrus' and then the result is
piped into an mh command which stores the mail in a folder.
Of course, this isn't a substitute for end-to-end encryption.  Here,
mail travels all the way to me before getting encrypted, so if
somebody wanted to snoop me they could just stand between the sender
and my account and eavesdrop.  A better solution would be to have the
sender encrypt the message!  But as I mentioned I was trying to set
this up so that replies to a USENET posting got encrypted before
finally getting dropped on menudo.  An improvement would be for me to
get the encryption and remailing working on the NeXT, but again, this
is inferior to having the sender encrypt in the first place.
You mentioned trying to put your mail through a filter - were you
trying to use the filter command of elm?  Sometimes you have to watch
subtle things like file permissions (slocal will not use a
.maildelivery file that is group or other readable) or pathnames (try
putting the fill path names when you use commands).

A while ago Dave Sun suggested keeping a file containing the public

signed by myself and occasionally others.  I recently uploaded a
tar-gzip file with the public keys I have, and an MSDOS zip file of
the same info will follow shortly.
I'd like to (at least) get the remailer operators to sign their keys.
I must apologize in advance because once I went through my key ring
and removed all the "unknown signator" signatures, and thus have
probably erased the signatures that some put on in the first place.
If this is the case, please send me the remailer keys, your public
key, and I'll add them both to my ring so I won't have those errors in
the future!

Yeah, the discussion centered on whether remailers should modify text
(converting tabs, crlf, strip signatures, etc.) or not.  I guess it
would be "best" if the remailers just pass text on through, but then
some people can't help extra stuff their mail software puts in.
Right now, you can form your message and encrypt it with extropia's
public key - that remailer will only forward text encrypted text, so
your signature will get removed.

There must be some correlation between my weekend trips and other

I've tested the remailers with unencrypted requests, and have received
these replies (within seconds, I might add):
tamaix.tamu.edu       <-- note, 'Return-Path: remail at tamaix.tamu.edu'
                                'From: remail at tamsun.tamu.edu'
                          just in case you see the from line and think tamaix
                          isn't working
So I'll wait for the others (rebma, extropia, utter, uclink, jarthur)
and then try them all with encrypted requests.
A while ago I had a script test all the remailers once a week - I
wasn't able to have a cron entry, but I used the 'at' command to
schedule the mailing of prepared messages and itself every week.
Maybe I'll start that up again since it would help isolate problems if
a remailer doesn't respond, especially if twice in a row.

cumbersome and subject to evasion, we should give it full

Regulated encryption!?
This topic was discussed quite thoroughly in sci.crypt in response to

The article is very interesting, containing many oxymorons:
"On the contrary, implementation of an intercept capability together
with appropriate security measures is more likely to lead to
telecommunication systems that are "smarter," more secure, and of
commercial interest to other countries."
"while often labeled as "anti-privacy," wiretapping actually serves to
protect the privacy of law-abiding citizens and the business
interests of corporations"

Like any new technology, selling crypto to the public will be
difficult at first.  I'll bet the telephone, something so vital to
today's society it is difficult to imagine functioning without it, was
tough to get going.
PROPONENT: "Just imagine the service and convenience!"
OPPONENT: "What services and conveniences?  I visit the people I want
           to talk to and conduct my business withing 5 miles of home."
At the time there were no neat services or conveniences.  Buying into
new technology will cause resistance, since people are not going to
miss what they do not have.
However, I think some crypto technology will be easier to sell than
others.  It should be easy to convince people of the need for good
encryption, the kind that can protect you or your company's financial
information, mail, ideas, etc.  Also, digital signatures and
authentication techniques should face little resistance.
Now, anonymous remailers and other privacy methods will be a little
harder :-)  (witness the debate over anonymous speech occuring right
On a related note, it is amazing how much information about you
exists.  Did anyone else watch a PBS documentary about this (sorry, I
can't remember the name of it)?  In the report, a writer researched
how direct mail marketing departments seek out infomation - from going
to the county court house and obtaining property and deed information,
to using census information to classify your living habits,
professional organizations you belong to, catalogs for mailing lists
of various interests, etc.  Some supermarkets were even testing a

saved and indexed by your credit card or check!  Banks could then sell
this extremely valuable information to direct mail houses.

@_subject: CASH/REMAIL: combination 
Some people have made excellent suggestions regarding digital cash and
anonymous remailers.  I'm going to try to obtain another account from
a friend in order to implement a remailer which accepts digital cash.
(However, this will probably wait until I am able to upgrade the bank
to PERL)
Maybe future for "profit" anonymous services will work similarly, thus
helping to cut down on remailer abuse since abusers must be willing to
"pay" for the service.  I don't think I can work in usenet posting as
well (technical reasons not philosophical ones!) but the whole thing
should be an interesting experiment anyway.
The remailer will work like the others, except valid cash must be
included or the remailer will not forward the message.  For ease, a
number of bills will be generated upon request, which will then be
deposited as used.  As a side effect, bank accounts will be
incremented as well (too bad real banks don't work like this) so
customers may "withdraw" more bills to use for remailing messages.
Since the bank won't mail back confirmation of deposits (messages may
be coming from other remailers, etc.) and it would be nice to have a
way for you to see if your cash was accepted and your message
forwarded, I think I'll have the bank accounts copied into the .plan
file so you can finger the account, check your account number and
balance, and determine whether or not the remail was successful.  Of
course, the full account number will not be displayed - perhaps the
MD5 hash of an account number or whatever will be put in the file,
along with the account balance.  I'll also provide a command to obtain
the .plan file via email, for those without finger.
Actually, for the purposes of this experiment, it might be best to not
use the new site in a chain.  At least until the single hop mode works
Nathan Estey suggested to me that traffic analysis could be made more
difficult if messages under a certain length were padded, and message
over the length were split and remailed a piece at a time.  This will
help, although I think it would be easier for the sender to include
padding in the message itself (thus identical messages plus random
padding will encrypt differently).  Plus, the message may be multiply
encrypted and thus padding cannot be added "inside."  Maybe future
mail software will automatically pad in addition to encrypt :-)
I may implement a delay feature, which would help foil traffic

@_subject: CASH/BANK: combo 
Hal saw through my laziness attempt: I thought it would be "easiest"
for a cash accepting remailer to increment an account (marking bills
as spent) and have users request more bills from the bank rather that
filter requests through me.  However, this does lead to a perpetually
full bank account...
But actually, a full service bank isn't required (although maybe that
would be nice) - all that's really needed is for the remailer software
to compare the included digicash versus a spent cash list and a valid
cash list.  The banking portion need only be one command for me to
use: one that deposits newly created cash into the valid cash list.
When a letter arrives, the digicash is checked, added to the spent
cash list, and re-routed.
For privacy, requests for digicash could come to me via anonymous
remailers, along with the appropriate header to allow me to respond.
This would render logs relating digicash and user useless, since I
wouldn't know who is requesting digicash bills.  On the other hand,
somebody could store up several digicash bills by routing their
request through the various remailers.  But I'll accept that risk,
hoping that nobody on this list would prepare a email attack (except
for the unfortunate folks who can't seem to unsubscribe :-) JUST KIDDING!!)

@_subject: MISC: steganography & pics 
I too have played around with graphics formats, specifically the TIFF
format.  It's a large and complicated format, but it does leave room
for customization.  I just mention this because I'm more familiar with
TIFF than the GIF format.
Skipping over 99% of the details: the TIFF format has a header (magic
numbers and stuff), tags and corresponding information fields, and
picture data - real terminology exists, like image file directories
and so forth, but I'll skip that.  The TIFF format allows you to
specify quite a bit of info: information fields such as time of
creation, author name, comments, host system; picture information such
as rows, columns, whether the minimum value corresponds to black or
white; color models: RGB, CMY, CMYK, greyscale; compression model:
none, LZW, JPEG; alpha values, and many other fields.  Finally, the
picture data is stored, non-sequentially if desired (that is, row 1,
then row 137, the row 54, etc.)  TIFF is extendible by simply defining
new tags.
Because the TIFF format is so all encompassing, few software packages
can read and write the entire thing - that is, valid TIFFs may be
created that may not be recognized by other software.  Sam Lieffler
(sp?) at sgi has written a comprehensive TIFF manipulation package
available via anonymous ftp which helps to overcome this problem.  Anyway, for steganography purposes, we wouldn't want to define a
"crypto" tag obviously!  Maybe we could adapt one of the other fields,
like host computer or whatever, so that the signal that a TIFFs
contains hidden information is that one of the fields has a certain
value, to be arranged in advance or whatever.  A 256x256 image contains 65536 pixels, each of which could contribute
1 bit to a message, which comes to 8192 bytes (say each pixel is 8 bit
and not 24 or something fancy like that), more than enough for a
message.  This sounds like fun - I imagine in a few weeks there will be a
message to the list to retrieve the recently posted image from
alt.binaries.pictures.misc and read the hidden message!

Q1: What cypherpunk remailers exist?
 1: hh at pmantis.berkeley.edu  2: hh at cicada.berkeley.edu  3: hh at soda.berkeley.edu  4: nowhere at bsu-cs.bsu.edu  5: ebrandt at jarthur.claremont.edu  6: hal at alumni.caltech.edu  7: remailer at rebma.mn.org  8: elee7h5 at rosebud.ee.uh.edu  9: phantom at mead.u.washington.edu 10: hfinney at shell.portal.com 11: remailer at utter.dis.org 12: 00x at uclink.berkeley.edu 13: remail at extropia.wimsey.com NOTES: 	remail only, no encryption of headers
	support encrypted headers
	special - header and message must be encrypted together
	introduce larger than average delay
	CANNOT CONFIRM OPERATION YET! TEST BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO USE. *
	public key not yet released
Q2: What help is available?
Check out the pub/cypherpunks directory at soda.berkeley.edu
(128.32.149.19).  Instructions on how to use the remailers are in the
remailer directory, along with some unix scripts and dos batch files.
Mail to me (elee9sf at menudo.uh.edu) for further help and/or questions.

@_subject: Question 
Government Communications HQ or something like that.  It is similar to
the NSA.  Rumor has it that each agency taps the other's domestic
calls, so both may truthfully say that they don't engage in domestic
survellience... I beleive the U.K. still denies the existence of the GCHQ, despite
there being a large building with satellite dishes and antennas all
over it in Cheltenham (?).  I read that a government minister said in
response to a statement made by a former GCHQ chief that he worked
at the "GCHQ" that this didn't necessarily mean that GCHQ existed
before his tenure, nor does it imply the GCHQ existed after he left...
(This from the book _SpyCatcher_?)

@_subject: Huffman and Crypto 
I have a book titled "Data Compression" or something like that, which
explains Huffman and Huffman-type coding, arithmetic coding,
dictionary compressers (sliding window LZ* types), and JPEG
compression.  The book comes with source code, so if anybody else has
it and has a scanner...
As I recall, arithmetic compression works well, but is really cpu
intensive, even with a math-coprocessor.  Plus, you need to have a
rough idea of the statistical breakdown of the plaintext for
arithmetic compression to work as well as it can.  The Zimpel-Lev type
sliding window compressors are popular because they work well on most
inputs, with little or no pre-computation or statistics.
Isn't Phil Karn on this list?  I'm sure he can tell you everything you
want to know about compression :-)

@_subject: REMAIL: sendmail invocation 
I just adjusted the sendmail invocation in the remailer scripts on
menudo to include the -oi option ("/usr/lib/sendmail -oi ").  This
option tells sendmail to not treat a period on a line by itself as the
end of input.
(I remember having fun posting a message where I showed forging a
usenet post - my post had such a line, and the rest of the message
kept on getting truncated.  Miron brought the -oi option to our
However, it just occured to me that this is a simple, if unplanned,
way for people who have signatures automatically appended to messages
to use a remailer and have trailing lines cut!  No fancy "cut here"
marks for the scripts to recognize, let sendmail do the work!
On the other hand, I plan to not use sendmail in the long run.  I plan
to upgrade to an smtp package (hopefully to avoid logging like syslog)
sent to me by Peter Honeyman, so I'm going to leave the sendmail
invocation with -oi.
