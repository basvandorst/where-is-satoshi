no kidding.. it wouldn't be hard to have something to capture the signal to open the car doors and start the engine.  anyhow i wouldn't trust anything to be controled by a radio freq. anyhow.. it never works.. for example the garage door openers (pardon my spelling) people are robbing houses by duplicating the garage door opener
