@_subject: List for crypto minus political rubbish 
Just about everything on cryptography has already been said far too many
times. Just read Applied Cryptography and be done with it. What remains to
discuss is politics, psychology and marketing. How do you get people to use
the cryptography that already exists and how will the authorities react when
people do use it.

What if Person A is better armed? Could that change the outcome?

@_subject: Netescrow & Remailers? 
How about this idea for improving the remailer network:
Every remailer is marked as either IN or OUT, not both. An IN remailer
accepts mail from anybody but remails only to other remailers (IN or OUT).
An OUT remailer never remails to another remailer, only to final recipient
If an IN remailer finds itself as the last one in the chain then it picks
an OUT remailer at random to send the message through.
This way there would never be any abuse complaints on IN remailers because
they are invisible. When an OUT remailer is taken out nobody gets hurt
because OUT remailers will never be used in reply blocks.

Another way to get rid of the totally clueless and involuntary subscribers
would be to require subscription requests to be PGP signed and acknowledged
by the subscriber.
