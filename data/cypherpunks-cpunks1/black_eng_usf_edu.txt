@_subject: Question about the Timing Attack 
I have looked over the paper, but I will look more closely this weekend (finals going on right now).
  The main question I have, since my programs run over a network with dumb terminals is this: If someone can get the timing information why would they need it, since they can read the message.  So how can this attacker get the timing info without being able to read the message   Thanx.

@_subject: using PGP only for digital signatures 
I am in a discussion (during the week) with a system administrator about seeing if we can just make PGP publically available to everyone, but now the discussion seems to be to just allow PGP to do digital signatures, and I don't think that is the best choice, then.  They are not against PGP being used, but there are legal issues as to whether they can offer it to everyone, as some students are international students, and are not allowed to use the version for the US, or so I have been informed, so now I need to see if we can have the international version, so these students can use it. :(
  Is there any good programs (for the Unix, SunOS) that just does digital signature encryption?  What they are trying to do is make certain that no one can send a message to anyone, claim to be in the faculty, and cause problems that way.  My position is just a student programmer, but I am trying to learn as much as I can, to answer questions and deal with problems.
  Thanx.

I'm trying, but all the legal angles need to be covered first.  This answer helped a great deal though.  Just remember, I am just an undergrad student. :)
  Thanx.

@_subject: using PGP only for digital signatures 
I brought up the security issue with the administrator that I am talking with, about the implementation of PGP as it looks like it will go through all the hurdles.  The last difficulty is that we have a student that has an account here, but he is actually overseas (so we will have two copies of PGP, and he will use the international one, not the US one).  The security issue is important.  Part of that is that most users use dumb terminals, so any programs ran will be done on remote servers.  My solution (until I get a better idea) is to just write a mail program that can check the hash value (I think that is the term) of the PGP executable, compare it against the one that it created originally and use it, only if they are the same.  The user can also request the number, and write it down for his own personal comparisons.   The program will also automatically encrypt, if it finds the public key on the user's keyring, or the universities keyring.  I will now check on how secure the LAN network is, as I am a student and I want to know that the system is safe.  She (the administrator) felt that if it is safe against people getting into accounts it should be safe, but if I my signature is on a document, then people will believe that it is from me (until I state otherwise), and that could be more damaging than getting into my account.
  Well, I am looking into the security side, since the legal issues are pretty much done with (IMOHO).  If anyone has any brilliant ideas as to how to run PGP on a multi-user network utilitizing dumb terminals so it can be transparent I am interested in options.
  Well, take care and have fun, and I will look for RIPEM (I think that was the name) and see if that will be adequate, at the moment.

I am planning on changing pine (a mail program on the Unix) to use PGP and RIPEM directly, and this is one of the issues I am dealing with.  The fact is that if you let someone get your secret keyring and password then that is your problem, as both should be secure, esp your password.
  What I am hoping to do is just have every message that is to be signed to be signed with the thumbprint (hash?) of the message, and this will be put at the bottom of each message, every time, so that it protects from any messages being changed, and verifies who sent the message.
  Again we go back to the fact that the weakest link here is *you* not   Take care and have fun.  BTW: Once I am done this version of Pine will be export controlled it sounds like. :(

The paper suggested that you have two different keys, one for encryption and the other for signatures, and you don't mix the two up, so that way you are protecting yourself from someone forging your signature, but you are not letting them know what your private key is.
  Make sense?  I would suggest that you read the paper, as it is really an excellent document.

@_subject: Keyed-MD5, ITAR, and HTTP-NG 
As a student I am concerned with the false security, and that was mentioned while we were talking (today).  As to liability, it is important that no one can come back and hold the school liable.  Once the messages can be encrypted then it is harder to read the messages, but not impossible, unless the students keep the key on a disk, and just ftp it into the account everytime.  The fact is that that won't be the rule, so the admin can still read messages, but there will need to be clear-cut reasons for them to do that (IMOHO).  I am curious what requirements must be met.  I guess there are more schools that allow this than I expected .  Well thanx for replying.  Take care and have fun.

I have been reading this discussion, and I would recommend that someone show the time that Bruce Schneier has in his book "Applied Cryptography" (2nd ED), as he covers the security of different key lengths very well.  I would also suggest that people read it if this is a topic that interests them, as it was written very well.   I would quote from it, except that I am at work, and the book is in my dorm room. :)
  Enjoy and have fun.

@_subject: Revoking Old Lost Keys 
If there is someone that you trust (or several people), just make a revocation certificate and possibly cut it into pieces, and just let those know when to send it out, so that you don't have to rely on a faulty memory, and by having it in several hands they can't just send it out, as they don't know the other people.  Just a thought.

@_subject: Looking for code to run an encrypted mailing list 
The way to do it is for the system (listserver) to have everyone's public key, and just encrypt every message for that person.  If this isn't done already I could get around to writing the program to do this.

In my case what seems to happen often is that my boss(es) will make some
minor change (to them) that requires making many changes to the code, and
so it takes me longer than I expected, or my homework load gets very heavy
for a few days (when projects are due :) and I have less time to finish
the program.
  Just why I sometimes go over-deadline.
