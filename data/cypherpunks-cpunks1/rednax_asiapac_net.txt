With reference to se7en's incident, is it because of implications like that
that Up Yours doesn't work?

Speaking of NT, I downloaded the full version of msie 3.0 the other day but
when I tried installing it, an error message came up saying that it requires
a Win95 or WinNT4.0 build of 1381 or higher. I am currently running NT 4.0b
that has a build of 1314, does anyone know of where is the upgrade or
service packs(if available)? I have tried looking around microsoft.com, but
they neither provided any detail nor did they provide an e-mail.

Hmm, this page however, does something if you are using netscape

@_subject: Crypto Num Mum, Hmm 
Are perfect numbers of any use in cryptography?
I have yet to come across the usage or application, let alone heard of it,
but has there been any proposals?
