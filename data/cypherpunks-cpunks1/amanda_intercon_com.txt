Indeed.  Every job I've had since part-time consulting in college has been gotten through the net, and with me electronic presentation and reputation a large factor in getting hired.  My official title at InterCon is "Software Engineer / Net Goddess", and among my official responsibilities are to competently and professionally represent myself and my employer on the Internet.  The whole reason I'm on cypherpunks, in fact, is because we're ramping up on supporting encryption & authentication in our commercial software, and this is where the ideas are.
It would also be hard to ship things without highways & airports :).  This is why the net is an example of infastructure.  InterCon probably makes more money from people who download our demos over the net, or see reviews and recommendations on comp.sys.mac.*, than we do from our traditional printed advertising (and given the quality of a couple of our MacWeek ads, this is a darned good thing :)).
I agree.  And reputations *are* becoming at least partially digital.  I've refused to hire people because I've seen them being twits on the net, and I've hired people (and been hired) because I make a generally good net.impression.  It even got my picture in Fortune magazine this spring.
If that's not at least a start at a digital  reputation, I'm not sure what is.

develop *any* Internet software, secure or not.  Although, I have to say,
I've never seen a startup that pissed off so much of the Internet industry

Sure.  Netscape has managed to alienate many IETF working groups, including
HTML, HTTP Security, IP security, and so on by implementing and distributing
half-cooked "extensions" to HTML & HTTP without a lot of forethought.  As a
result, they've greatly multiplied existing interoperability problems, and
created a very confused environment in precisely those areas that most need
standardization and consensus (security and HTML itself).
That help?

@_subject: Clarification of my remarks about Netscape 
Several people have asked me to clarify my recent comments about Netscape.
I am more than happy to oblige.
First of all, let me begin by saying that I am a biased observer, and that
all of this is my personal opinion.  My annoyance with Netscape is also closer
to the surface this week than it normally is, due to a variety of factors
(including having just returned from the San Jose IETF meeting).  My initial comment, and the ones that follow in this message, are thus more frank than is my usual style on, say, public Usenet newsgroups.
That being said, here are some of the data that has gone into my impressions
of Netscape so far.
(1) Netscape plays very fast and loose with HTML.  Rather than participating
    in the existing standardization efforts, they have indiscriminately added
    "extensions" to it that are not supported by any other client software,
    and which in some cases go directly against HTML's markup-oriented
    structure.  This only adds more confusion to an already muddy area,
    delays the prospects for a standard HTML specification, and divides the
    WWW into "WWW Classic" and "Netscape-compatible".  Personally, as a
    strong proponent of universal interoperability, I find this reprehensible.
    There is no need to bypass existing efforts just to add cosmetic value to
    your own software.
(2) The Netscape Secure Sockets proposal has an extremely poor security model.
    It is not an end-to-end security model, but rather relies on transport
    level security, which is in my view dangerously inadequate for reasons
    which should be obvious to most of the folks on this list.  It is also
    tied directly to the RSA certification hierarchy.  Now, for those of us
    who have X.509 certificates rooted in the RSA Commercial Certification
    authority, that's fine, but it also means that any other WWW client that
    wishes to interoperate with Netscape's "secure servers" must license
    TIPEM from RSA Data Security, and consequently pay RSA's rather high
    royalties, unless the software is free (in which case RSAREF can be used).
    This serves as a direct barrier to competition from other commercial
    vendors.  This is not all bad--I happen to like RSADSI's products and
    technology--but promoting a transport-level security system instead of
    an end-to-end one is to my mind simply irresponsible.
    There has been no peer review of Netscape's security model--it was simply
    implemented by fiat, without regard for the IETF standards process.  I
    find that this leaves a very bad taste in my mouth.  I also heard similar
    sentiments from a wide variety of other attendees at the IETF, including
    members of the IP Security working group, people who attended the Secure
    HTTP BOF, and others.  This leads me to believe that it's not just a
    matter of me leaping to wild conclusions.
(3) Netscape is viewed as a "loose cannon" by most of the other commercial
    players in the WWW arena, mainly because they have introduced a fair
    amount of FUD into the HTML standardization effort, while simultaneously
    promoting themselves as being standards-based.  Members of Apple's
    "Cyberdog" project and Microsoft's web projects, who *are* trying to
    contribute to the standards process, had particularly excoriating things
    to say in this regard.
Now, as I said, I am biased and my comments about Netscape are strictly my
person opinions.  I will be perfectly willing to revise these opinions as I
receive more data.  For example, if Netscape takes a more active part in
the standards process, works with RSA to secure wider availability of the
underlying technology required by their proposals, and generally demonstrates a willingness to play nicely with other children, that would be great, and I'll just as strongly defend them as I am panning them now.
However, in my view, they have not shown a good initial track record.
Only time will tell.

I disagree.  The WWW is no longer a research project, and if it is to
survive it will have to do so by consensus, either formal or informal.
That's what standards committees, and groups like the IETF, exist to
The alternative is fragmentation, which we're already starting to see
(in part because of Netscape's unilateral changes to HTML).
Let me re-iterate something here: I'm biased.  I'm a commercial vendor.
I'm perfectly happy to live by the sword and die by the sword if that's
how the market ends up--I just think it would be better for the Internet
as a whole if the actual on-the-wire protocols and formats become standards,
so that people don't have to worry about what clients or servers they are
talking to.  UI, performance, service, and such are fair game.  Infastructure
has to be consensus-based or it fails.
But hey, if Netscape can innovate by fiat, so can anyone else.  Right now,
I'm betting that Netscape will decide it's worth cooperating with the
standards process.  If they don't, they'll just fragment their own market.
I can live with that, but I think it would be a shame.

@_subject: Clarification of my remarks about Netscape 
[I'm sending this to the list because it does have some crypto content]
Agreed.  My annoyance with Netscape is not based solely, or even primarily,
on security concerns.  In fact, my only annoyance with your security
proposal is that it is at the wrong layer (or, more accurately, at layer
which should be secondary).  In my view, you picked the right technology,
but applied it to the wrong problem :).
SSL is a mechanism whereby a client and a server can establish a secure,
authenticated transport channel.  The problem is that this isn't what I want to secure and authenticate.  Most of the time, in fact, I don't care about
the transport: I may be talking through a proxy (like the current CERN httpd), or bringing things in from a cache, or talking to a load-balanced server array.  I want the *documents* I'm accessing to be secure and/or authenticated.  I want my HTML documents signed and certified by the *author*, not the server.  I couldn't care less about the server if I can verify that I've got the right document in response to my query.  Similarly, if I send the contents of a form containing, say, my Amex number, I want to encrypt the session key with the public key of the merchant, not the service provider.
This is what I (and many others) mean by an "end to end security model."
Transport security is a nice secondary ability (it helps defend against traffic analysis, for example, and casual snooping by students with packet sniffers), but without end-to-end security, it's simply a way of providing a false sense of security.  I wouldn't want to do away with the TCP checksum field simply because the modem I use for my SLIP link is "error-correcting," and I feel the same way about security.
I'd rather that technical feedback occur in a public forum like the IETF.
I have no pretensions about being a security expert, and I want people to shoot down my bad ideas too.  Heck, I *like* having my competitors tell me what's wrong with my ideas :).
Nope, not if I want to sell it (note the word "commercial" in my comment).
RSAREF cannot be used for commercial software, nor can IDEA under the PGP license.  There is no feasible way to license the RSA patents for commercial use except by licensing TIPEM.  I have been told this outright by Kurt Stammberger of RSADSI (their VP of marketing, I believe).  This is not secondhand information.  All commercial software that I know of using RSA public key encryption and RSA stream ciphers (such as RC2 and RC4) uses TIPEM and BSAFE, including Lotus Notes and Apple PowerTalk.  RSA's royalty structure is based on a percentage of revenue, with the percentage on a sliding scale based on gross corporate revenue (not just on products which use RSA's patents).  If you keep your margins low to compete in the marketplace, you lose.  Even you folks are making your money on high-margin products (servers) rather than low-margin ones (clients), I'd wager at least in part because it's a way to make money despite having to pay RSA royalties.
The RSAREF license has been loosened up some recently, but it's still restricted to freeware.
I don't have to pay royalties to sell an implementation of TCP/IP.  Your analogy fails.
You've already got your eggs in the right basket on this one--sell servers and services, not client software.  Microsoft has a miserable track record in the server arena (witness the underwhelming success of Windows NT :)).  It's also less of a commodity market, which is where Microsoft excels (no pun intended).
Mostly RSADSI people, by my count.  Great technical background, but I wouldn't call relying on one of your technology vendors "peer review"...
Precisely.  Rather than working with others in the industry and research communities, you are trying to push your proposal into the standards track.
On this I agree completely.

Actually, it's not an extension to HTML, but to MIME (whose formats HTTP uses top tag and label data), and it just went to Proposed Standard (the last step before Internet Standard).  The MIME multipart/signed and multipart/encrypted body parts allow anything using MIME encapsulation to sign and/or encrypt arbitrary body parts.  Since it's at the document layer, it requires no special transport software, works with existing proxies and caching servers, and allows secure HTTP software to share code with secure email software (since it would use exactly the same formats).  The framework is general enough to allow use with either PEM-compliant signatures and encryption or others (such as PGP).  I believe that can also be used with symmetric key management, which could be useful for special purpose applications.
EInet's secure SHTTP proposal is also an end-to-end security framework.

@_author: Amanda Walker 
@_subject: HTTP security 
I think I'm starting to need a quick reference card :).
This is true.
Just as an exercise, I'll give a description of the informal model that I have been using as I evaluate different proposals for secure HTTP (and other Internet security proposals).
(1) I trust the network somewhat more than I trust the server machine.
    This is why I don't like SSL, for example.  Now, I realize that this
    assumption is not a universal (someone in a college dorm would trust
    the server a lot more than the network), but the fact is that once you
    get off your organizational Ethernet, it's hard to monitor the Internet.
    On the other hand, servers are a problem.  If someone's running a web
    page on Netcom, for example, I don't want to have to worry about whether
    or not they've been broken into this week (note that I'm using Netcom
    strictly as an example--the same concern holds for any public access
    system).  I want to be able to authenticate the content I am viewing
    without having to worry about whether or not the transport & server
    systems have been compromised.  I'm still vulnerable to a denial of
    service attack, of course, but at least I can tell when I do get something
    that it is genuine.  This concern holds even when I don't care if the
    content is encrypted.  If I get sales literature, I want it signed by
    the organization it claims to be from, and so on.  And for this purpose,
    I like X.509.  Self-signed certificates are fine, if there are other
    ways to verify the public key.  Signed PGP keys could be used as
    certificates as well, of course.
(2) I want authenticated content all the time, even if it's just to an
    anonymous key pair I've gotten through some other channel.
(3) I want private content sometimes.  When I want private content, I want
    end-to-end privacy, not just transport level privacy.
(4) Occasionally, I want transaction security (sending a credit card order,
    for example), where I want the transaction to be encrypted, signed, and
    not subject to playback attacks.  Ideally, the server itself won't be
    able to decrypt it--only the actual recipient will.
In all cases, I expect the network and the server machines and software to be insecure.  Anything else is simply unrealistic.

Do you need a server certificate issued directly by one of these PCAs, or does it just need to be rooted there (i.e., can I use my [hypothetical] corporate PCA, which itself has a certificate from the RSA commercial PCA)?
If it's the former, I would strongly urge you to extend your clients to include the latter.  I don't want to have to go to RSA for every server certificate--that's in part what the PCA hierarchy exists for.
Similarly, if I set up a personal server (with my home page, for example), can I'd like to be able to use a certificate issued by the RSA Unaffiliated User CA, which is itself a PCA certified by the Commercial CA.

Very much agreed.  This is why, in my description of the rough criteria I sent out, I included mention of self-signed certificates (which only show that you do in fact have the private key corresponding to a given public key), bare keys, and so on.
There clearly needs to be facilities for encrypted anonymous use.  To expand on my example of wanting sales literature to be signed so I know it's genuine, I correspondingly *don't* want to include a certificate with identifying information in my own query--I get enough junk mail already, and I don't want vendors to be able to capture market research at the browsing level (I haven't looked at WIRED's server for precisely this reason).

Well, it's what Apple is using for PowerTalk signers (which are a key pair and X.509 certificates, by default from the Unaffiliated User PCA).  It makes sense for personal (as opposed to organizational) servers, such as someone running MacHTTP for their home page...
On the other hand, if RSA has set up a server PCA, that should be suffcient for now.  I wonder what the certification policy is, though--how do you prove that you control a given server?  For an Unaffiliated User CA certificate, you just have to show a notarized application and two forms of ID, one with a photo (driver's license, passport, etc.).  I can't off hand think of an equivalently strong way to ID control of a server...

The two are not necessarily mutually exclusive :).  And from this point of
view, I have to say that for all of my complaints about the specifics of
various things Netscape has put forth, I cannot fault them for trying to
improve the status quo.  One thing that everyone has in common here is that
we all believe that the issues we discuss are important, and that it's worth
trying to solve the problems.  This is in part, I think, why tempers flare
from time to time--I know this was true in my case.

@_subject: McCoy is Right! New Mail Format to Start Now. 
I'd actually be interested in a poll, but I know better than to actually ask for one :).
I have to admit some bias here--our flagship product for the Macintosh contains a very MIME-aware mailer (which I am working on making crypto-aware as well), and which was designed to make MIME seamless.  No helper software, no extracting pieces and finding a viewer for them, it just works.
In my case, it's because I intentionally make them fit.  Most mailing lists have a general expectation of plain ASCII.  When I send mail to other people at InterCon, I (and the recipients) see something that looks like any other Mac document--nice formatting, diagrams and screen shots displayed inline, and so on.  And when someone sends me a file via email, even if they're not using a MIME mailer, it shows up as an icon I can drag to a folder in the Finder.
This isn't really a commercial for my product, though :).  This is how I think MIME was meant to be implemented, and it's analogous to how I think encryption should be implemented.  Forget helper applications, macros, and so on.  There should be two popup menus on the envelope: "sign with" and "encrypt with".  When you select them, you get prompted for your passphrase, and it just works.  This is the same direction that other commercial vendors are headed, and it's this kind of simplicity that I think will finally get people to start using the technology (just as with MIME).  On this, I suspect the Netscape folks and I are in violent agreement :), as probably are you from some of your comments to this list...
Right now, PGP is more of a bleeding edge technology than MIME is, IMHO.
Indeed, that's why I brought it up; at the moment, I'm sitting in my study at home posting over a dialup (14.4K) PPP link.  I've also posted from 37,000 feet sitting in a DC-10 (in coach :)), with my mail being queued up until I could jack into a phone when I land.
Hmm.  I'd say it's a partially solved problem.  Newsgroups like clari.features.dilbert are popular enough that there's at least a significant fraction of people who can handle MIME messages with embedded graphics.
Well, I could start posting some, if you want existence proofs :)...

Actually, that's not my feeling at all.  I haven't (at least intentionally) been making or intending to make the kinds of "get with the program" remarks that Lucky, Perry, and some other have been.  I've just been trying to explain why I think that MIME isn't necessarily bunk.  There is a middle ground between "the one true way" and "utter crap," after all, and I found your assertions that MIME was useless to be just as annoying as assertions that it's a panacea.  I'm not telling you (or anyone else) to use MIME.  Even I don't use the fancy features MIME for most of my off-site email, especially mailing lists, for exactly the reasons you describe.
I'm just tired of people deciding the because they're not able to take advatange of something, that it is therefore useless.  That's all I've been intending to complain about, and I'm sorry if I've come across more strongly.
I certainly don't want to chase you off the list.  You're one of the people I take pains to read, even on high-volume email days...
Well, I came onto the net after the NCP/TCP flag day, so you've got some seniority on me, but I'm hardly a young gun, and I hate Intel processors and UNIX :).  I started in the spring of 1982 on a VAX 11/780 with real live DEC VT100s, and an ADDS Viewpoint on a 1200 baud modem (at the time, this was really fast) in my dorm room.  I was just awful to come back from a week's vacation and spend a whole hour catching up with Usenet--and that was before you could unsubscribe to individual groups :).
To a large degree, it's this dozen years of experience with the net that makes me optimistic about things like encryption, MIME, and so on.  Every time the baseline moves up, people complain.  It happened moving from NCP to TCP/IP.
It happened when moving from A News to B News (my site was actually an A News holdout for a long time).  It happened when net.* got broken up into a set of hierarchies (alt.* is a remarkably long-lived fragment of that changeover), and it's happening now with things like PGP & MIME.  Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose.
Part of the cypherpunks mission, as I understand it, is to help to keep moving that baseline, concentrating on one particular direction (privacy).
I'll stop posting on side issues if it will help keep the focus on privacy, and help keep folks like you from giving up in frustration.  After all, cypherpunks is far from the only soapbox I subscribe to :).

There's been a fair amount of discontent here in the the last year.  I don't think it's a matter of any one flameful discussion (of which many have gone by recently).  Rather, I think it's a matter of frustration.  PGP has acheived a fair amount of recognition in the user community at large, and lately even in the mainstream press.  However, beyond PGP and some anonymous remailers, there's not a lot else out there.
There won't *be* anything unless we build it.  No one's going to come riding in on his white horse to hand us crypto-security.
We all agree we need better tools, and that everyone else needs better tools
before they'll start adopting the technology we so fiercely believe can save us from the erosion of our civil liberty and personal privacy.
So let's build those tools.  Strange as it may seem, I actually have to weigh in on the side of Netscape in some of the arguments that have come by in the last week or so.  They are building stuff, after all.  That's better than most of the people on this list, from what I can tell.

Exactly.  What allows something to be used as an economic unit are
its uniqueness and liquidity.  Real assets are unique simply by virtue of being physical objects, and are liquid (in the long run) by virtue of having inherent value.  I don't worry about someone forging my house, for example, and even things like gold coins or other precious metals are much easier to verify than to forge, and once verified can be exchanged for real assets without reference to the entity which originally issued them (for example, the value in a Krugerrand is that it's gold, not the fact that it was issued by South Africa).  Precious metals and the like are borderline, for all practical purposes we can view them as having inherent value, since people have assigned them value for all of recorded history.
Currency, however, has no inherent value.  Its only value lies in its being made up of unique tokens which can be exchanged for real assets.  If a token ceases to be unique, it ceases to have value (except perhaps as a curiousity--
there may well be people who collect counterfeit money, for all I know).  Also, if it loses its ability to be exchanged for real assets it likewise loses its value (e.g., Confederate dollars from the Civil War).
Digital cash poses two problems.  The first is that digital information is easier to duplicate than to verify, and a successful forgery is absolutely indistinguishable from the original, since it is the information itself that is the token, not any phsyical instantiation of it.
The other is that to be successful, digital cash needs to be liquid.  For a token to be liquid, it must be backed by real assets.  Governments are the classical examples of entities which have sufficient resources to back a currency, although cartels in the private sector can also do so (VISA/
MasterCard, for example).
So far, though, no one has solved either the uniqueness problem or the liquidity problem for digital cash.  As a result, it might be more realistically be called "digital scrip", at least so far.
Indeed, mainly because existing currency is either physical objects or data controlled by the banking system and overseen by governments.  Right now, digital currency only works by being a pointer to a token, not the token Speaking as someone who has a sharp interest in such things, and the resources to apply to them, I have to say that the current regulatory environment serves as a large barrier.  If industry's hands are tied, then this all has to be done in "free time" or academia...  This slows things down immensely.
If it weren't for the Department of State holding the export-control sword over our heads, we'd already have things like digital purchasing, online user registration, digital sigs & encryption by default in email, and so on.

It's not entirely a fiat value; in effect, it's backed by the strength of the economy.  The difference between a ruble and a dollar was not the fiat value (they were the same, as I remember), but in the fact that it was a lot easier to exchange dollars for real assets.
For the record, I think that going off the gold standard was a bad idea, but growing up in the days of double-digit inflation probably gave me a biased opinion of floating currency.
I didn't say that the government had to be the agent of such an exchange.
I can buy real assets with my dollars, but not with Confederate dollars.
While it has been somewhat eroded since the start of the Drug War, dollars are still exchangable for real assets, even though the government is no longer backing them directly.
Little plastic tokens that are accepted more places than the government's paper and metal ones.  If it quacks like a duck...
Exactly.  On the other hand, with real-time clearing (which the Internet
*does* provide the ability to do, with ever-increasing capacity), you can construct something that acts like an "instant check", which is close enough to cash for most practical purposes.

Do PGP key blocks bigger than the message body count as "fancy crap"?
Fancy and Crap are both in the eye of the beholder :).

Well, aside from the fact that I was being intentionally annoying (you
will note that I do not normally include my GIF signature in my messages),
I will say that the bugs in your mailer are not entirely my concern.
MIME is a standard for email on the Internet.  If your mailer chokes on it,
you can always get another mailer.  Pine is good, from what I've heard,
and handles MIME just fine.  It's just as free as ELM...

Actually, I'm not, any more than you're expecting me to hunt around for
a copy of PGP just so I can verify your signature.  Secondly, having to
hunt around for viewers is something that has to do with your mailer, not
MIME itself.  For example, when I receive MIME email with images, they
just appear inline with the text.  Just because the easiest way for
mailers like ELM to support MIME is to call out to metamail or the like
doesn't mean that's necessarily how MIME was meant to be used...
Yes, it is.  The MIME RFC specifies image/gif and image/jpeg as the
standard formats for including images in Internet email messages.
That's the problem with depending on UNIX :) :)
Just as a reminder, I'll point out that I do in fact sympathize, which is
why I refrain from using graphics, styled text, HTML links, and so on in
my messages.  I just have a strong disagreement with the sentiment expressed
by Tim, where limiting email to what can be punched onto Hollerith cards
is seen as a feature, not a bug.  On the other hand, since designing UIs
for Internet software is how I make my living, I'm no doubt biased in favor
of it being a bug.

I don't see so much of a difference.  There is very little difference in the nature and methods of governments vs. corporations.  A government can usefully be viewed as a corporation engaged in the business of public services.  It's simply a geographical monopoly, as are many public utilities.

The government does not have a monopoly on military force.  In fact, the 2nd amendment explicitly prohibits such a monopoly, however much it has become eroded in recent decades.
However, I will agree with you that a certain amount of corporate coercion goes on with government collusion (not all, however: look at Westlaw or Equifax for examples).

@_subject: Will all codes and ciphers be broken? 
Indeed.  The situation is analogous when it comes to other areas (such as financial fraud, corporate espionage, and so forth).  A modern cipher is not going to be the weak point of most cryptosystems, unless it is intentionally crippled (cf. export restrictions to <= 40 bit keys for DES & RC4).  The (publically known) "codebreaking successes" (outside of contrived academic exercises) of recent decades have not involved cryptanalysis at all.  This point is also lost to most people in the Clipper debate.  Too many people, I feel, are focussed upon back doors in Skipjack.  This seems to me to be missing the point.  Skipjack could be a perfectly good block cipher, perhaps a
Lucifer/DES-style product cipher with more rounds and bigger boxes.  The point of Clipper is that it would institutionalize *non-cryptanalytic* intelligence gathering capabilities.  It's the digital wiretap initiative wrapped in a large red herring.  The actual cipher is completely incidental.
At this point in history, humans are much easier to subvert than ciphers are.

@_subject: Hi again, and an invitation to kibitz 
Hello folks,
A couple of years ago I signed off of cypherpunks in annoyance at what I
thought was a high "fluff" level, and said I'm sign back on when I had
crypto software to talk about.  Well, I do and so I have :).
Last week at MacWorld Expo, we announced a new product designed to provide a
secure AppleTalk tunnel over the Internet; we'll be doing a public beta in
a few weeks, and expect to be shipping relatively soon after that, assuming
that the public beta goes well.
The initial version is moderately secure (that is to say, I believe that
the most effective attacks to be DES key search and a dictionary attack on the
user's pass phrase).  I'm interested in comments on weaknesses aside from the
use of 56-bit DES; I'm profiling DES-EDE and if it's fast enough we'll be
switching to that.
Here's a sketch of the protocol:
(a) Server sends 8-byte challenge to client
(b) Client sends Microsoft NT authentication response to the server
    (take the password in Unicode form, do an MD4 hash, pad with 0s to 21
    bytes, split into 3 7-byte groups, use these as DES keys to encrypt
    the challenge three times, send the 24-byte result as the response).
(c) If authentication fails, close the connection.
(d) If authentication succeeds, all subsequent traffic is enccrypted with
    DES in CFB mode.  Until April :), the DES key used is taken from the
    first 7 bytes of the MD4 hash of the password (after April, we expect
    to switch to Diffie-Hellman key exchange first, followed by a revised
    authentication handshake).
I have not been able to find any obvious weak points, even if MD4 is weak,
since the digest is not put on the wire--recovering the digest would require
recovering a DES key given a single known plaintext/ciphertext pair.
I would be very interested in
any weak points anyone can identify (particularly with step b, since that
would have repercussions beyond this little piece of software).
I would also be interested in the effects on anyone's analysis given the
following modifications:
- Using SHA (160 bit hash) instead of MD4
- Using DES-EDE (112 bit key) instead of DES
- Using Blowfish in CFB mode instead of DES
- Using RC5 in CFB mode instead of DES (not likely unless RC5 is cheap)
- Using RC4 (40 bit key) instead of DES (not likely)
Comments?  Catcalls :) ?

Correct.   This is the reason I've been thinking of switching to SHA-1,
which gives a 20-byte hash (leaving only one byte of zeros, which can
be filled in with some function of the other 20 bytes to arrive at 21 bytes).
I haven't found any hole opened by exposing the last two bytes of the MD4
hash, but it's the piece I'm most worried about just on general principles
(never expose more than you have to :)).  I'm currently using the NT
algorithm simply because I had it around and needed to get a demo working
for the show.  We're not tied to using it, although it would be useful
if we end up doing an NT version of the server (since NT stores the MD4
hashes of passwords, not the plaintext).
Yup.  April was wishful thinking on my part; we won't adopt D-H until the
patent expires.
Yup.  I started with vanilla DES because I was worried about speed, but
as it turns out the cipher step has a negligible impact on performance.
I'm considering DES-EDE (the easy option), Blowfish (also pretty easy),
or the DES variant Bruce Schneier describes in Applied Cryptography, 2nd ed.
(the one with independent subkeys).  So far, DES-EDE and Blowfish are the
front runners, since they're the ones that have been poked at the most.
DES-EDE has the advantage that more people know what DES is (the "buzzword
compliance" factor).  I'm not inclined to make the cipher a user-configurable
option unless customers demand it, just to keep the user interface as simple
as humanly possible.

Well, in the week or two since resubscribing to Cypherpunks, I've seen a
trickle of postings about cryptography, security, and privacy, and a flood
of insults, harangues, fighting words, and so on.  Some of this reads more
like a script from a Jerry Falwell TV spot than anything I recognize as
"Cypherpunk" traffic.
I don't care who's offended whom.  I'm not interested in participating in a
forum where the supposed topic is submerged underneath a lot of adolescent
alpha primate chest-beating.
I'm off to look for a mailing list where people are ACTUALLY DISCUSSING
CRYPTOGRAPHY AND IMPLEMENTING CRYPTOSYSTEMS.  This list may still be
called "cypherpunks", but it doesn't have much cypherpunk left in it, as
far as I can tell.

Please excuse if this is a FAQ.
I'd been operating under the assumption that the Diffie-Hellman patent
(4200770) will expire on April 29, 1997 (17 years after the date of issue).
Several people have recently told me it doesn't expire until September,
evidently confusing the date of issue with the filing date.  However,
does anyone know of another patent (Hellman-Merkle, perhaps?) that would hve an impact on software that does D-H key exchange?  We've got some planned uses of DH; while it doesn't seem cost effective to pay to license DH at this point, that six-month difference is something I need to plan around if Amanda Walker
