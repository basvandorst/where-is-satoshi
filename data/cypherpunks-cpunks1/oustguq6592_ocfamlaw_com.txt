What are your tips for clearing clutter so you can focus on such a project as sewing?" well mary, let me answer your question by showing you some examples of how i deal with clutter in different areas of my home:
ps- did i say i would sew this past saturday? i meant next saturday! haha!
kiss me, i'm irish
here's an irish blessing from us to you...
i am not going to worry...about a thing.
i love her style. i always enjoy knitting lacy stuff but this pattern was especially fun, super easy, and portable.
may you always have courage to take a chance and never find frogs in your underpants.
i told cate about st. patrick's day and ireland- she has a lot of irish ancestors through me. and you are happy.
but so worth it.
the ms craft dept was featured in an article, and their personal crafting projects were shown. i am blocking my two latest projects today and will show them tomorrow. i recommend rounding your troops for a similar conversation, and a brainstorm session for how to prepare for what lies ahead. just sayin.
i am trying to be a patient, kind mom.
i love the color palette and obvious softness. like this one, from sweet mary, that she left on the clean room post: "Your house seems so organized. really, cate is also mexican, japanese, native american, swiss, and a lot more- a true american- so we actually have a lot of family history travelling to do, but i really love the romantic beauty of ireland, and have always been drawn to that part of the world. plus i really love corned beef.
corned beef is cheap meat, a head of cabbage is less than 50 cents, and i bet you have all the ingredients for the bread in your cupboard. you should make this meal tonight!
