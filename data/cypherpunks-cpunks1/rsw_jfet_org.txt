I have a Samsung SCH-8500 cell phone that has a built-in modem.  (You
connect it to the serial port on your computer via an overpriced cable
and send it AT commands.)  Using pppd under Linux on both the client
and server end, I dial a modem on my home machine.  The only other
piece of software I use is mgetty on the home machine to actually
answer the phone---it hands it off to pppd quite nicely.
The mgetty+sendfax documentation and the pppd manpage contain all the
information you need to get something similar working for you.

The enhanced security regulations apply only to airplanes flying under
FAR part 121---airplanes with 10 or more passengers onboard.  Those
airplanes operating under FAR part 135 (9 or fewer passengers---what
most general aviation pilots fly) are not subject to the same security
procedures; for the most part, I'd expect that people and companies
who don't fly commercial airlines are more or less ignoring the
enhanced security bullshit.  (There are other requirements for FAR
part 121---max gross weight, etc.---but for the most part, you expect
that 10 or more passengers is 121, 9 or fewer is 135.)
Up until some time in 1997, pilots who were certified only for part
135 could still fly small commuter planes.  The Clinton administration
enacted the "single level of safety" rules that required all
commercial carriers to operate under 121, mostly due to pressure from
various interests after the several ValuJet-style crashes.  However,
charters and private airplanes are still almost exclusively operated
under 135.
As to your idea for a buy-in airline, the biggest problem is going to
be that you have to have 9 or fewer people on each flight.  Because of
that, it's going to be prohibitively expensive (you're going to be
investing $5M to $10M on the plane initially, plus operating costs
around $1k/hour of flight, if not more).

============================== START ==============================
The example you're thinking of, I believe, comes from Peter Wason.
Imagine you have 4 cards on a table.  On visible side of the cards is D, F, 3, and 7.  You are asked to test the hypothesis "If a card has
a D on one side, it has a 3 on the other."  Which cards do you need to
turn over to test this?
Most people would say D, or D and 3.  The correct answer is D and 7.
You need to test that the D has a 3 on the back and that the 7 does not
have a D on the back.  Since the statement is expressed as an
implication (D -> 3), you don't need to check the 3 because it wouldn't
be relevant (3 !-> D).  It's pretty obvious why you wouldn't need to
check the F.
Now, reword this same test that almost everyone fails.  You are a
bouncer at a bar and are enforcing the rule "If a person is drinking
beer, he must be 18 or older."  You may check what people are drinking
or how old they are.  Which do you have to check:  a beer drinker, a
Coke drinker, a twenty-five-year-old, or a sixteen-year-old?  It's now
pretty obvious to everyone that you need to check the first and the
Peter Wason claims that the difference here is not just the concreteness
of one versus the abstraction of the other; his claim is that the
hypothesis "if a person eats hot chili peppers, then he drinks beer" is
no easier to prove false than the original card test.  It is only the
situation in which a person tries to detect cheaters that makes this
test easy. For more on this topic, see such books as Steven Pinker's "How the Mind
Works," a reasonable introduction to modern psychology.

@_subject: Tunneling through a hostile proxy? 
Doing this would violate the HTTP CONNECT semantics described in the
IETF Internet-Draft "Tunneling TCP based protocols through Web proxy
servers" by Ari Luotonen.  Not that that's stopping anyone.
I've written a perl module, Net::HTTPTunnel, that allows you to make a
CONNECT tunnel through an HTTP proxy and treat it as a normal socket
object (it's very simple---it just handles talking to the proxy server
and returns an IO::Socket::INET object).  It's available on CPAN.
Note that most proxy servers are configured to allow CONNECTs only to
port 443 (https) and 563 (snews).  Of course, all you have to do to
get around this is run an ssh server on port 443 or port 563 on a
machine you control that lives outside the firewall.
Using the above-mentioned perl module, have a program listening for
connections on your machine inside the firewall which will, upon
receiving a connection, establish a CONNECT tunnel and forward packets
in both directions.  Now all you do is ssh to that port on your local
machine and tunnel any other protocols you want through the ssh
connection (for example, run squid on the machine outside the firewall
and forward a local port to the squid server across the SSH tunnel if
you wish to conceal your at-work browsing habits).  I'm using just
such a tunnel to write this email.
Of course, there are lots of ways to make tunnels.  A good friend of
mine used to tunnel through his high school's firewall using a program
he tossed off that would get the data back and forth through the
firewall in HTTP POSTs.  Sure, it's more complicated, but when his
school turned off CONNECTs to prevent the method described above, he
took it personally.
I think there's even a program out there that creates a (very high
latency!) tunnel using email.

@_subject: Degrees of Freedom vs. Hollywood Control Freaks 
It's true that tubes distort differently, but not for the reason you
If you compare the transfer characteristics (Vce vs Ic with Vbe as a
parameter) of a tube to those of a transistor, you see that (using BJT
terminology) the transistor passes through saturation and reaches
linear operation at a relatively low Vce (triode/linear, saturation,
and Vds respectively, for you FETholes).  On the other hand, the tube
does not saturate quickly in this way.  If you draw a load line over
these transfer characteristics and grind through the math (or have
Matlab do the work), you'll see that BJTs and FETs produce mostly
odd-order harmonic distortion, whereas tubes produce more even-order
harmonic distortion.
The audible difference in this distortion is consistent with empirical
results from acoustic musical instruments: violins (and other stringed
acoustic instruments), which produce mostly even-order harmonics, have
a drastically different timbre from, say, a clarinet, which produces
mostly odd-order harmonics.
While I'm sure you're right that most people can't tell the difference
between .01% and .001%, I'm not sure I believe that _everyone_ likes
distortion (or, if they do, that everyone likes distortion of the same
kind or level.)  It seems that when you _re_produce a recording you
may as well do so with as much fidelity as possible, leaving it to the
artist to introduce whatever distortion they intend when they record
When I listen to Ormandy and Philadelphia perform Mahler 2 I want the
utmost fidelity; at the same time, I don't complain about the
distortion in the recording when I listen to the Smashing Pumpkins's
latest album.

In automotive power systems, the bigger concern is load dump.  When
there's a step change in alternator load from high to low, the commutating
inductances resulting from the field windings of the alternator can't
react quickly enough, and you tend to get big spikes on the power lines.
Perhaps this could be used to advantage---if you want to convince
someone that your electronics blew up on their own, blow up the
rectifier at the output of your alternator, too.

If all you're trying to do is screw with surveillance cameras, a Xenon
tube is crushing a fly with a crane.
You can probably get away with an IR laser and a diffuser or something
to that effect.  It would be cheap (diode laser) and easy to build
(for a strobe-like effect it would take, what? a 555, a couple
resistors, a cap, and the diode).
If you want, you can probably extend this idea to much more IR output
just by adding more diodes and more juice.  I don't remember the
numbers off the top of my head, but IIRC the efficiency of a diode is
substantially greater than the efficiency of a Xenon tube.
Just took a quick look around, and it seems like a Xenon would still
work at 900nm:
        Apparently, Xenon tubes put out lots of crap around 900nm.  In fact,

@_subject: Cypherpunks response to viral stimuli 
If it's the type of virus that delivers its payload as soon as it's
viewed (relying on bugs in MSOE or whatever), then it's possible that
such a thing could go undetected, especially if AV signatures haven't
been updated to stop it.  Of course, you could also just put a web bug
in an HTML email sent to the list and wait for people to view the
message in the proper viewer (read: MSOE, &c).
Other than relying on bugs (or "features") of the mail client,
however, it seems that any such system relies on the user opening a
malicious attachment.  Any reasonably clueful person knows not to do
this, so the answer to the filter question is yes; lack of stupidity
is a filter that will stop this sort of attack.  Of course, this
assumes that the mail client doesn't automagically execute the
payload; on the other hand, it could be argued that using such a
client is itself an act of stupidity.
There's another answer as well: subscribe to a moderated node that
demimes messages before passing them on.  Viruses won't get through at
all, nor will HTML email.  LNE used demime before its demise;
pro-ns.net and al-qaeda.net do as well.

It seems that more and more people see "racism" where it doesn't
(necessarily) exist.  Perhaps this is simply because it's a convenient
catch-all counter-argument---"you're arguing that way because you're a
racist, hence you're immoral, hence I win," an ad hominem "trump card"
that more often than not passes for a real argument, probably because
people are afraid to voice opinions to the contrary for fear of being
labeled racists themselves.  Another more insidious possibility is
that as a result of such tactics, people actually _do_ see racism
where it isn't.  The latter worries me.  A lot.
In any case, before you tear into me for being Tim's shill, consider
whether the following examples count as X-ism:
1) I hate X people because they are X.
2) I hate X people because most people who are X are also Y.
3) I hate people who are Y.  Most people who are Y are also X.
I'd say that the first one is the very definition of X-ism.  The
second one seems to me to be a special case of Y-ism (assuming that,
as seems to be the case given the phrasing, Y's are hated for being
Y), but is not X-ism.  The third one, the one I believe describes this

Well, clearly there's the frequency on which the satellites broadcast
(~1500MHz).  I think his point was that to jam the GPS you've got to put
out RF energy on the appropriate frequency, which would then be
traceable to you.
Of course, you can do a bit better by using the external antenna jack
and feeding the signal straight into the phone.  Make sure in this
case that you're using low enough power that you don't blow up the

I don't see the benefit of adding another layer on top of the JVM.  Tor

the host machine than Tor talking with a Linux kernel running on the
JVM.  Moreover, you don't actually realize a benefit in portability by
adding the Linux-on-JVM abstraction to the soup.

FPGAs are mostly useful for prototyping.  Once you've decided on a

Have to in what sense?  If they're constantly reconfiguring the FPGAs
(new software revs, or some sort of evolutionary "learning" process---
the latter not likely in telecom, of course), sure, they have  to be on
reprogrammable structures.
If, on the other hand, you're building a custom hash cracking machine,
you don't need to reconfigure your gates. You could design your
parallelized SHA1 cracking machine and dump it onto a bunch of FPGAs,
but if you really have unlimited resources you take the plunge into
ASICs, at which point you can tighten your timing substantially.

Oh, sure.  Buy yourself the flexibility of the FPGA, e.g., by putting an

Note also that you can probably buy yourself lots of performance without
increasing the design cycle time all that much by simply synthesizing
(via Synopsys or the like) the same Verilog with which you would have
programmed the FPGA.  Buy (or pirate if you can; it's not like you're
selling these things, so who cares about the IP issues?) a set of
standard logic cells in the smallest process you can afford so that even
the lion's share of the layout can be done in a completely automated

I don't think it has to be this broad to cover the mp3=copying issue.
You can draw a continuous line from the original performance through
one or more automated processes intended to reproduce said performance
(recording, encoding, printing the CDs), and at all steps along the
way the newly-created data is said to be a "copy" of the original.
There is nothing particularly special about lossy methods of deriving
new data from old, since it's the fact that it is so derived that
makes it a copy.
It's a violation of copyright to translate a book into a different
language and sell it as your own, even if the two languages are slightly
at odds with regard to, e.g., their colloquialisms (i.e., the
translation is "lossy" in some way).  It's about the chain of
derivation, not the subjective experience.
IANAL, and I don't know if these arguments are "right" in any particular
legal context; take this as nothing more than musings on the definition
of a copy.

Or even better, have out1, out2, and out3 diverge and run through their
own mix chains with randomly-selected lengths to make it harder to
correlate pieces of a message.
Then you just need some up-front processing and the reverse on the
client end to combine out{1,2,3} into an intelligible message.  Perhaps
something where each (n-1) messages can be used to produce a decryption

@_subject: Noise keeps spooks out of the loop 
Sounds like a practical secure implementation of this will be very
difficult.  Consider that if Alice and Bob do not perfectly synchronize
the resistor transitions, there will be a window in which an attacker
will see a line that is unterminated at one end.  It's trivially easy in
this case to determine the resistance that has already been connected to
the line, and with proper equiment (e.g., TLP) it would also be possible
to determine which end of the line is unterminated.  Those two pieces of
information uniquely determine one bit of the key.
Or how about this: if the resistors are not perfectly matched, there is
a difference in resistance when Alice chooses low versus when Bob does,
leaking key information.  Beyond that, resistor properties change over
time, which requires that Alice and Bob calibrate their resistors to one
another on a regular basis. Any such calibration step gives Mallory yet
another way of corrupting the protocol.
I'm sure that at least some of these concerns are addressed, but I'd be
gravely concerned about a system where at the end of the day you're
relying on the hope that you have timed and calibrated everything to
better than the enemy's sensing noise floor.

@_subject: uniform pseudo random number generation 
It seems to me like the extent to which you can decorrelate the output
sequences is rather limited because of the requirement that each
sequence contain {0..360} precisely once, essentially because the
uniqueness requirement means that each sequence is, to a large majority,
characterized by the entropy at the beginning of the sequence, but not
at the end.
For example, let's say you have generated all but one digit of the
sequence.  Since there is only one unused number remaining, there is no
information encoded in the final digit of the sequence.  Similarly, the
second-last digit is one of only two possibilities, third-last is one of
three, et cetera.  So, at most, the second-last digit has one bit of
entropy, while the first has log2(361) =~ 8.5 bits.
If this doesn't trouble you, it should at least motivate you to attempt
to appropriately weight the digits in the sequence when you measure
correlation (correlation early in the sequence is "worse" than late,
since there's more information encoded in the early numbers).
So then, on to generating the sequence (and then back, briefly, to the
correlation question):
Let's assume you get entropy from an oracle,
(implicitly assuming here that, like in the SysV function, state gets
updated appropriately).  Also, assume the existence of a function
that removes the kth element from an array and returns a new array with
length reduced by 1, and
that appends elm to array and returns a new array with length increased
by 1.  Then:
(1) Initialize numarray = {0..360}.
(2) k = rand(state);
(3) nextInd = k mod length(numarray);
(4) nextNum = numarray[k];
(5) outarray = push(nextNum, outarray);
(5) numarray = delete(k, numarray);
(6) goto (2) while length(numarray) >= 0;
This should preserve as much entropy as possible in the generation of
your sequences.
Now, back to the correlation for a second: I claimed earlier that you
had to weight the digits by how much information they contain, but I
didn't talk about how you might do this.  If you generate the sequence
with the above method, I claim that you can easily accomplish this by
saving the sequence of k's that you generate, as long as you are careful
to store each k in a number of bits (approximately, in practice) equal
to log2(length(numarray)) for the corresponding step in the sequence. By
doing this, the early k's are guaranteed to take up more bits than the
late ones; thus correlating the sequence of k's stored in this way gives
a truer measure of the correlation of the sequences.
Just my $0.02 +/- delta...

Twelve hours (or maybe three years, depending who you are) later than
promised, here's the first cut at the CDR howto:
Getting it all set up on your end is not terribly difficult. In fact, in
the past I've cobbled together other implementations where everything
was dispatched through procmail filtering on the Received header (the
list ran that way in 2004 for a month or two), so feel free to riff on
the basic config as long as you don't break anything at the boundary.
The part we have to redesign is the way CDR nodes share their subscriber
lists / maintain a common whitelist. In the past this was done with
Majordomo "who", but I think it's a bad idea to enable this.
I propose instead that each node push its local subscription list to the
other nodes, possibly PGP signed to defend against the obvious attack
whereby massive amounts of garbage can be injected into the whitelist
with very little effort. (Yes, someone can still subscribe a massive
number of addresses to a node, but such activity has less leverage and
will draw attention.)
I'll put together the appropriate scripts tonight(ish), and once someone
else has a node set up we can do some testing and put the D back in CDR.

A more detailed analysis of what's going on with the JS exploit:
    Hits a vulnerability in the FF17 Javascript implementation. Notable
because FF17 is the long-term support version, and it's the one included
in the TOR bundle (though JS is off by default in the bundle).
This business with the FBI spraying JS hijacks around the web is more
than a little troubling. Is this the first widely-publicized case of the
feds indiscriminately deploying an exploit on this scale?

so. There may be some brief outages. Thanks for understanding.

@_subject: Switching power supplies 
I doubt you want to use anything so zany :)
What you're talking about is a relatively high power design, which means
that in addition to worrying about designing the switching supply,
you're going to have to sweat the practical details regarding PCB
layout, et cetera.
I'd have a look at some of the reference designs and application notes
from the usual suspects (onsemi.com, ti.com, maxim-ic.com, linear.com),
since they will have a lot of good practical information on getting the
supply built. For example,
    seems to have a substantial amount of reference material available.
For more general information on theory and practice of dc/dc converter
design, "Fundamentals of Power Electronics 2e" by Erickson and
Maksimovic is my go-to reference. It more or less assumes you're already
an electrical engineer, which may or may not be useful to you. Along
these lines there's also "Principles of Power Electronics" by Kassakian
et al, a book dear to me but certainly not to all.
If you're looking for a gentler introduction, Google should be able to
point you to a few tutorials, e.g.,
    I've been kicking around an idea for a weird little buck converter
controller that I haven't actually built yet. It's not particularly well-
suited for kW converters, though, since the most basic form of the idea
involves using a P-channel device for the high side switch. For any
reasonable amount of power you end up wanting to use an N-ch, as they're
generally higher performance devices than their P-ch counterparts (in
silicon, hole mobility is about 1/3 of electron mobility, so devices
that control electrons are generally higher performance than devices
that control holes).

The list *should* be fully operational and is on a new host.
Never fear if you're still resolving the MX as 69.60.117.34, I'm abusing
iptables to make things work until everyone's DNS updates.
