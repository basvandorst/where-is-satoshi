@_subject: Important Information about IETF 76 Meeting Registration 
Registration for IETF 76 will open in the next several days and we  want to alert you to some exciting changes coming your way.
1) New Meeting Registration System
We have moved to a new meeting registration system. The first time you  use the new system (called ARO) you will need to create an account.  Your account will be password protected and only you will have access  to it. Your contact information will be saved, making registration in  the future much simpler, and you will be able to update your contact  data, registration information, etc at any time.
2) RFID Tagging Experiment at IETF 76
The hosts for IETF 76 are organizing a RFID tag experiment for the  meeting. The tag will be affixed to the underside of your meeting  badge, as a sticker, and will contain only your full name and any  listed affiliation. The experiment will allow us to explore the  possibility of electronic blue sheets (though we are still using paper  blue sheets as the official blue sheets of record). We also hope that  the RFID tag will improve the experience for remote participants,  since speakers will be identified through the RFID tags.
While you will be given the option to "opt out" of this experiment  when you register for the meeting, we sincerely hope you will  3)  One-day Guest Pass Experiment
For IETF 76 we are also offering a one-day guest pass for $200. If you  only plan to attend one day of meetings, you now have the option to  select which day (Mon, Tues, Weds, Thurs or Fri) when you register.  After the meeting, we will solicit your feedback on the one-day pass  option and evaluate to see if it makes sense to offer at future  Please contact me if you have any comments or questions. And I look  forward to seeing you at IETF 76 in Japan!
