I think the concept presented at the end of that last paragraph is one
of the best ones I have heard.  If put to the average user on those terms,
I would think it would be relatively easy to convince them of the value of
crypto.  No non-technical type would even think of sending snail mail
without an envelope, out in the open for everyone to read.  So the concept
of an "electronic envelope" for email is a very easily grasped one.
However, I have noticed that the rules that often apply to snail mail,
including basic grammar, punctiation, capitalization, etc., often do not
apply to email for some odd reason.    I think some more of the problem
lies in the fact that the tools aren't all that user-friendly for the
non-power user.  A lot of people are intimidated by the very concept of
email itself.  I can only imagine what they must think when someone begins
to go on and on about public keys, and private key, and codes, and
encrypting, and decrypting.  People fear technology.  They are the same
people who will never enter a credit card number on a secure web site, yet
have no qualms about telling it to someone over a public telephone, or cel
    That's a good place to begin, though.  "Would you send a letter to
someone without an envelope?"  "Then why not put your email in the
electronic equivalent of one?"

@_subject: more FUD! 
First time poster.  Been reading for awhile now and I feel like a goof
for having to ask, but what does FUD stand for anyway?
