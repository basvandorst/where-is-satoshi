@_subject: Global Strike to protest Wassenaar 
I agree that the primary damage, and resultant attention, is [necessarily]
focused upon those whom [indirectly] had the least to do with "inflicting"
this upon us (very accurately put), however, it is also the way most
likely to generate the necessary awareness of the issues.  Our biggest
problem isn't that Wassenaar is forced upon us by bureaucrats: our problem
is that hundreds of these types of things are forced upon us every year,
and *nobody cares*.  Our people have become so totally numbed and
apathetic, that if they are not "bitten" directly, they could care less.
I submit that this strike allows them to be bitten, albeit mildly, and
that this *may* (and may very well *not*) raise their attention level a
notch or two...

:Helsinki, Finland, December 15, 1998-- Data Fellows, the global leader in
:developing data security software solutions, has been invited to join the
:Microsoft Security Partners Program.
"Invited"?   You mean they finally accepted your application, right?
:The Microsoft Security Partners Program
:( provides customers with the
:tools and information they need to establish, test and maintain effective
:information security for their computing infrastructure. By providing real-life examples of how NOT to implement security
practices.  By simply purchasing these failed products (at only *slightly*
exhorbitant prices), so can learn by example: see for yourself just how
easy it is to completely botch a security directive.  Witness how
thoroughly you can mangle password encryption.  Learn what major design
flaws *really* look like!
:The program brings
:together software manufacturers, security consultants and security
:trainers, making it even easier for customers to provide robust security in
:their Microsoft Windows NT operating system-based networks.
Just as soon as it becomes available?  Oh, BTW, when *will* that be???
:Three Data Fellows products are included in the Microsoft Security Partners
:Program. I'm sorry.  But don't worry, if you keep working on it, you'll be able to
sell it to a *real* vendor someday...
:F-Secure Workstation Suite consists of malicious code detection
:and removal as well as unobtrusive file and network encryption,
Very unobtrusive, I'm sure!  Does the attacker even know it's there?
: all
:integrated into a policy-based management architecture. Hmmm... Somebody's been playing with their buzzword-generator again :)
:F-Secure VPN+
:provides a software-based, IPSec/IKE VPN solution scaleable for large
:corporate networks as well as remote and small office networks.
Was that IPSec/IKE, or IPSec-like?  I vote for the latter.  It's just like
IPSec, but without wasting all those nasty cycles on dumb things - like
encryption: it's *so much* more user-friendly when it doesnt [further]
slow the speed of new window open/closes...
: F-Secure
:FileCrypto is the first and only product to integrate strong real-time
:encryption directly into the Windows NT-based file system.
Could be, we already know that Micro$loth has *no clue* when it comes to
these things (Right Paul???)...
:"Microsoft is pleased to include Data Fellows as part of its Security
:Partners Program," said Karan Khanna, Windows NT Security Product Manager
:at Microsoft Corp.
Of course you are.  Micro$loth would be pleased to welcome Joseph Stalin
into the Security Partners Program.
: "This program will help our mutual customers develop and
:deploy secure solutions built on the Windows NT platform."
Just as soon as they can get Windows NT to run faster than a 6809 with 1k
of 512ns RAM and a single parallel port for IO ;-)
:"The relationship with Microsoft shows Data Fellowsï¿½ commitment to improve
:the native security of standalone and networked computers with a
:comprehensive, centrally managed suite of security services," said Risto
:Siilasmaa, president and CEO of Data Fellows. You're *that* worried about Micro$loth's current offerings, huh?
Personally, I'd let them fend for themselves, but...
:"Data Fellows is committed to
:providing globally available And this *IS* your *FIRST* priority, isn't it?
:seamless security for Windows users; security
:that is strong yet easy to manage and economical."
Great!  Let me know when it's available!
:Data Fellows is one of the worldï¿½s leading developers of data security
Really?  Who decided that?  Do you have any research to back up this
awe-inspiring claim?
: The company develops, markets and supports anti-virus, data
:security and cryptography software products for corporate computer
That's only because most of the private networks already know better.

Is it better that we make martyrs of the entire population?  We are busy

should just go ahead and execute him, rather than make a policy of
deliberately toruring an entire country.  Even the Good Of The Few
arguments go in favor of this "option".

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...

didn't escalate.  countries like Iraq to sell oil at or below cost?  And isn't that the
entire point of "allowing" Iraq to sell oil at the rate of some 50 billion

He can slap that order on anything he likes, even if it is an unpublished

method used by the fedz to avoid having to do a complete "site
clearance" on certain new defense contractors (at least this was true in
the late 80's - I have no reason to think it has changed).  If work is
expected to yeild "national secrets", but it is expected to do so without
utilizing previously classified materials ("classified" being over
"Sensitive"), the work is normally allowed to progress until such time as
a "secret" work product is produced, at which time it is retroactively
classified to it's appropriate level(s).
These shenanigans work in the fedz favor because it costs real dollars to
send out the men with the little plastic ID cards to do site surveys and
personnel background checks.  If the work is unsuccessful, they have not
wasted the $$.  If it comes to fruition, they impart a "temporary" site
and personnel classification, classify the work product, and only then
spend the necessary money and D.I.S. hours.

Lets get my position straight:  I think spam is annoying as heel, and
should not be done.  I don't think that SPAM is going to cause any major
social upheavals.  I also disagree that all people want to be spared from

Google is your friend here: this has been litigated to death already.  Of

While I agree that home schooling is a [very real] threat to public
education, I think it is so for an entirely different reason: it shows
that there is a real alternative to sending your children into the hell
holes that are our public schools.  Obviously, having this kind of
[extremely attractive] alternative threatens the State Mind Control
Interesting.  I have not known many home-school families, but none of the
ones I _have_ known were fundamentalist christians, or for that matter,
fundamentalist *anythings*.  In fact, the most successful home-schooler I
know is a long time cpunks member (although I haven't seen a posting from
him in about a year ).
Of course they should.  But the religious communities are well organized,
and present a real threat to government if pushed to the point of acting
in unison, so the government has chosen (as do all such schoolyard
bullies) to graze in easier pastures.  For a modern example of how this
works, look into the history of the Church of Scientology.  > Another facet is that the well-to-do are attempting to remove their
So I must educate my children according to the public good, and not the
good of the kids themselves?  Fuck you.
To be frank, sending kids to public schools is practically *requiring*
that they become "thick", merely in order to _survive_.
While you claim to favor choices, you have just argued that these choices
should not be available.
Make up your mind.

Today must be "my day"!  I get a "tahnk you for the cite" from Tim, and a
semi-nod from Declan.  Shit, a guy could have a heart attack this
way !
I will grant that in my red-flag state (above), I was obviously not clear,
so let me make my argument clearer.
My point was that we have long since departed from the long line of
"jurisprudence" to which you refer above.  In real terms, in the USA
today, there is no difference between speech and action (from the legal
point of view).  I am not talking here of the theoretical way that things
"should be" (and that are taught in larvae school as the way things
_are_), I am talking about how it really *is*, when you are actually in
the courtrooms, at the mercy of the fascists who are to "judge" you.
Remember Mr. London: "He has not recanted", and "Its still posted on the
internet today"...
*Perfect* example.
Other interesting examples are most certainly familiar to many of the
members of the list - certainly I cannot be the only one of us who has had
personal visits from federal badge holders because of political views
expressed here?

Actually, I think the currently "hip" term would be "twit" :-)
Which, in context, is clearly a justification of what follows it.
No, you did not.  Nowhere was this said or implied.  What you said is
above, so there is no need to  it here as well.
I am not endowed with any expertise on this topic, so I cannot make any
considered judgement on the example.  Having thrown out the required
caveat, it seems to me that the deregulation was only a small part of the
problem.  Of course, I am truly talking out of my ass on this topic, so I
will leave it here...
The fact that you consider this a "knee jerk" response does not make it
so: you have no way of knowing how much or little I have looked into this
topic.  As someone who has had 4 kids in various public and private
schools, as well as person who has personally attended two private and
three public schools, I have had ample incentive to look at homeschooling
when it began to cross my radar about three years ago.
My beliefs regarding homeschooling are very definitely _not_
knee-jerk reactions.  And my statements regarding the state of the public
schools is from personal first hand experience, both as a student, and as
a parent.
What "right wing war chants"?  Where the hell do you get the idea I'm a
right wing type of guy?  Just because I believe that home schooling is a
Good Thing and that the public schools are a life threatening repository
of brainwashing and bad karma?  Last I heard, it took a LOT more than this
to qualify as "right wing".
Again with the knee jerk label.  If it's a view you disagree with, it's a
knee-jerk reaction, huh?
I wouldn't know, I don't have much use for Rush, and have only heard
*about* his show.  However, we again see the disparaging of view with
which you disagree as terms such as "foolishness".  This "position" is
hardly persuasive.  Perhaps you can enlighten us as to WHY it is so
"foolish"?  Perhaps you can trade some FIRST HAND information you have on
the state of the public schools, so that we may more readily examine the
ISSUES before us, and not your assertions that all positions you disfavor
are "knee jerk reactions"?
No.  Your post did make several statements which claimed to favor
proposals that were fair to the community, but NOT to
individuals.  Personally, I think the Good Of The Many depends totally
upon the Good Of The Few.  The macrocosmic must fail if the microcosmic is
While I actually agree with this assertion to a degree, I would also
caveat it with (1) I can only supply a very weak degree of "confidence" in
the truth of this assertion, and (2) I am unable to compellingly argue
either for or against it.  This type of conundrum should lead the more
analytic amongst us to examine these issues on a much deeper basis,
hopefully to determine what properties are impeding the discovery of the
actual truth or flasity of the above premises...

no.  His is fighting for the freedom of his peoples to follow the path

As is George Bush and half the congresscritters.  As have been a great

Granted, we've gotten somewhat better in this respect, but then we've had
a longer period to try - and yet we are _still_ a helluva bad example

And we send in armed police to attack when they see a ranch they might

proportion to the level of distate expressed), is bogus.
At least they are being HONEST about it, no?  Here (USA) we are making

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of

Kabul, Afghanistan - The Recording Industry Association of Afghanistan (RIAA) has begun a major crackdown on pirated music since the Taliban fell from power 2 days ago, and
launched their own bid for control in the war torn city. Many cheered the fall of the Taliban, but the RIAA feels that if music can be listened to that copyrights will be violated. Soon after the Taliban fled Kabul, black market Qamar Gul and Ahmad Zahir CDs were being openly peddled on street corners. Rumors of Abdullah Muqri MP3s circulating on the Kabul computer were widespread.
"It was much easier to control music piracy when the Taliban was in control. Now we fear that with their new found freedom the people of Kabul and in the rest of Afghanistan will turn to copyright violation to satisfy their musical needs," said RIAA President Ghulam Hotak. "An RIAA lead country will be able to enjoy the joys of music, but only if artist are properly compensated."
Opposition groups denounce the RIAA power grab. "We will fight to the last man to keep the RIAA from power in Afghanistan," said General Mahommed Dawood of the Northern Alliance. "We did not unseat the Taliban only to have them replaced by a more oppressive regime."
The Recording Industry Association of America has pledged support to the RIAA by offering troops from its elite piracy fighting Freedom Squad. "We can not sit idly by and watch the people of Afghanistan violate copyrights. Our brothers in the RIAA need our support," said Hilary Rosen.

  -- Insufficient Complaint vs. Narco News and Al Giordano
  -- The Drug War Went on Trial And The Drug War Lost
  Stay Tuned for a Full Report:
    Narco News offers its profound thanks to our readers for your support   throughout this expensive attack on our free speech and press freedom.
  We thank the many people who donated large and small contributions to
the   "Drug War on Trial" defense fund to defeat the billionaires' abuse of
the   legal system to attack cyber-liberties.
  We extend our congratulations and gratitude to Mario Menï¿½ndez in
Mï¿½rida,   Yucatan, for his heroic work exposing corrupt white-collar drug
traffickers   and how the US DEA and other government agencies protect them.
  Mario started a movement. And this movement, to expose the real powers   behind the corrupt war on drugs, and to end the drug prohibition from
which   they profit, will continue, and will triumph.
  We have not yet begun to fight!
  We offer our most profound thanks to Tom Lesser, counsel to Narco
News, and   everyone at Lesser, Newman, Souweine and Nasser of Northampton,   Massachusetts, particularly Libby Spencer and Karen Thatcher, who beat
the   biggest lawyer-lobbyist firm in the world.
  Tom Lesser pitched a no-hitter against the Akin Gumpsters, the
overpaid   incompetents who struck out at every time at bat against the great
civil   liberties and free-speech barrister from Massachusetts.
  It is fair to say that without Tom Lesser, this immense victory would
not   have been possible.
  We also thank the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), who valiently
filed   an amicus brief on behalf of The Narco News Bulletin when other "press   freedom" institutions ran from the fight.
  We also thank Marty Garbus, David Atlas and the team who defended
Mario   Menendez so ably, whose teamwork and experience made this defense   unstoppable against the biggest of foes.
  And we thank all the many colleagues in authentic journalism who wrote   about, spoke about, reported on and investigated this case, and in
every   single instance concluded what NY State Supreme Court Justice Paula
Omansky   has just ruled: This billionaire's lawsuit should never have been brought.
  We are sure we have more people to thank, but frankly, it is Saturday
Night   in a country called Amï¿½rica, a night to celebrate. It's a world dance party,   from Cochabamba to your town.

@_subject: Nov-L: Supremes will interpret Apprendi in guns/drug offenses early 
Supreme Court accepts challenge of federal gun crime GINA HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer   (12-10) 11:23 PST WASHINGTON (AP) --  The Supreme Court agreed Monday to consider the fairness of federal
prison terms for inmates given longer sentences for using a firearm in
their crimes.     The question for justices: whether juries or judges should decide if
someone brandished or discharged a weapon while committing a crime.
In federal courts, juries must decide beyond a reasonable doubt if there
was a crime. Whether a gun was involved can be settled separately by a
judge, who uses a lesser standard of proof.
The Supreme Court will review the case of William Joseph Harris, whose
attorneys argued that the process violates defendantsï¿½ constitutional
rights to due process and a jury trial.  The weapon allegation does not
have to be listed in an indictment.
Congress requires longer prison sentences for people who use guns during
violent crimes or drug dealing.  The penalty for brandishing a weapon is
at least seven years in prison and for discharging a gun is 10 years.
Harris had pleaded guilty in 1999 to selling marijuana out of his pawn
shop in Albemarle, N.C. He wore a pistol in a hip holster while at work
for safety reasons, his lawyer told the court.  Harris bragged during
one sale that his homemade bullets could pierce a police officerï¿½s
armored jacket, according to government records.
A judge convicted him of brandishing a gun while engaged in drug
trafficking, then sentenced him to the mandatory seven years in prison.
"He could have received seven years even without that finding," the 4th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in rejecting his case.
The Bush administration had urged the Supreme Court to also turn back
Harrisï¿½ appeal, arguing that Congress in 1998 properly set penalties for
criminals who use weapons.
Justices decided to hear arguments in the case next year.
Harrisï¿½ appeal relies on a 2000 Supreme Court ruling that overturned a
New Jersey manï¿½s sentence for a hate crime.  Justices said a juryï¿½not a
judgeï¿½ should have decided if Charles Apprendi was motivated by bias
when he fired shots into the home of a black family.  Apprendi, who is
white, had gotten a longer sentence because a judge ruled it was a hate crime.
"Any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed
statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a
reasonable doubt," the court said in the Apprendi case.
Multiple appeals are pending or have come through the Supreme Court with
similar arguments from defendants in drug cases.
The case is Harris v. United States, 00-10666.

the security protocol that you're describing---i.e., generate a symmetric key and ship it encrypted with the recipient's public key---seems very expensive for a layer 3 forwarder (or, better, for what I think that that beast is, really). I understand that  a) you have limited a forwarder's scope to processing signalling data only, and b) PGP email, for one, use keys pretty much the way you said. Yet, I think one could do much better with a Diffie-Hellman cycle producing a batch of symmetric keys, which need not to be exchanged across the wire. This is what IKE (rfc2409) does. IKE has all sort of wrinkles to it in order to thwart DH vulnerabilities to men-on-the-middle attackers. A forwarder implementing such solution could attain a wide range of throughputs, possibly exceeding 1Gb/s with hardware crypto-assists (as commodity VPN boxes show today). Public key operations as you scoped will definitely lock you out of these ranges.

@_subject: BugTraq: EFS Win 2000 flaw (fwd) 
I have found a major problem with the encrypted filesystem
( EFS ) in Windows 2000 which shows that encrypted files  are still very available for a thief or attacker.
The problem comes from how EFS works when the encryption
is done. When a user marks a file for encryption a
backup-file, called efs0.tmp, will be created. When
the copy is in place the orginal file will be deleted
and then recreated, now encrypted, from the efs0.tmp-
And finally, when the new encrypted file is succesfully
created, the temporary-file ( which will never be shown
in the user interface ) will be deleted as well.
So far, so good. The only file remaining is the one
which is encrypted.
But the flaw is this: the temporary-file is deleted
in the same way any other file is "deleted" - i.e.
the entry in the $mft is marked as empty and the clusters
where the file was stored will be marked in the $Bitmap
as available, but the psysical file and the information it
contains will NOT be deleted. The information in the
file which the user have encrypted will be left in the backup
file efs0.tmp in total plaintext on the surface of the disk.
When new files are added to the partition will they
gradually overwrite the secret information, but if
the encrypted file was large - the information could
be left for months.
So how can this be exploited ?  If someone steals
a laptop or have psysical access to the disk it will
be easy to use any low level disk editor to search
for the information. For example, the Microsoft
Support Tool "dskprobe.exe" works fine for locating
old efs0.tmp-files and read information, in plain-text,
that the user thought was safe.	
In my opinion there should be a function in the EFS
which physically overwrites the efs0.tmp at least once
to make it a lot harder for an attacker to gain control over secret information.
Here is a description how to test this :
Use any version of Windows 2000.
Install the Support Tools from the Win2000 CD.
For demonstrating purposes - create a new partition with
the size of 7 MB.
Choose to format with NTFS.
Create a new small file ( easier to find ) with Notepad
and put some text in it. Save this file in the root of the
new partition.
Do not encrypt it yet.
Let us look at the file through DiskProbe before encryption-
start Diskprobe from Support Tools on the Start Menu.
A. Choose the "Drives"-menu and "Physical Drive"    Double click on "physical drive 0" ( or other drive you are using )
   Click "Set active" and then "OK"
B. Choose "Drives" again and this time "Logical Volume"
   Double click the drive letter for your new partition
   and then "Set active" and "OK"
C. Choose the "Sectors"-menu and "Read". For starting number
   type 80 and for the number - 35 perpaps.
Maximize the window and click the arrow for "Next sector".
At sector 86 you should see the name and contents of your
file ( assuming you made a new partition )
The file is obiously in plain text and easy to read for anyone
with physical access to this disk, regardless of permissions
in the ACL, which is ignored when using this kind of utiliy.
Better encrypt this file .. !
Now close the DiskProbe utility and open Explorer and locate
your new file. Choose Properties - Advanced - Encrypted - OK.
The file is now encrypted.
Wait a few moments to be sure the new data has been written
to the disk. Open Diskprobe again and repeat steps A, B and C.
When reaching sector 86 you should be able to see the name
of your file, but not be able to read the information - it
is now encrypted. But.. continue to click the Next Sector-Arrow and look carefully
at the information being displayed. A few sectors away from the
orginal file there should be a file called efs0.tmp - which is
the backup file EFS creats during encryption. You should ALSO
be able to see the contents of this efs0.tmp file - which will
be the data from the file you encrypted. The problem is just that
the data is in clear and plain text.
So again - anyone with physical access to this disk can read
the data you thought was safe.

Even though it's likely irrelevent over the long term, I would expect that
the contract would be somewhat self-destructive where it comes into
conflict with State law, for example, where the vehicle is required by law
to travel at some minimum speed (45mph on the highways around here), and
the rental contract specifies something different.
Obviously, I pulled this example out of my ass, and it is unlikely that
any of these contracts would attempt to enforce such a low limit, however,
it is descriptive as an example of public policy vs private contract
interests.  I am sure that the lawyercritters have given us any number of

statement excludes those persons committed to institutions by a court as

(2) The "2-P.C." [2 Psychiatrist Committal] laws do NOT apply to someone

under the jurisdiction of a *court*, and they are no longer patients (and
only _patients_ get 2-P.C.'d).

an immenent danger to themselves or others".  This is clearly not the same
as "have committed a crime".

Re:	Internet Piracy of Planet of the Apes
Dear Colleagues:
We at Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation ("Fox") are writing to ask
for your help and cooperation in the protection of our upcoming
highly-anticipated motion picture, Planet of the Apes.  Fox is the
copyright owner and owner of exclusive distribution rights in all media,
including the Internet, to this motion picture, which is being released
in the United States and certain other countries on July 27, 2001.  Some
pre-release screenings are already taking place.
As you are likely aware, technological developments currently allow the
seriously detrimental and widespread infringement of intellectual
property via the unauthorized electronic dissemination of films over the
Internet.  As widely reported in the media, up to 1 million illegal
copies of first-run movies are now available on the Internet.  Fox, in
cooperation with the Motion Picture Association of America ("MPAA"), the
U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI, is working to combat piracy of
films on the Internet.  We hope to be able to count on your assistance
as well.
We anticipate a high volume of Internet piracy of Planet of the Apes.
Illegal film footage posted and/or available for download on the
Internet is usually sourced from video recordings made in movie theaters
and digitally transferred into electronic video formats.  As Fox is
making every effort to aggressively battle Internet piracy, it is likely
that you will notice an increase in the volume of correspondence which
you receive from Fox and/or from the MPAA.  Therefore, we would like to
take this opportunity to introduce you to the department responsible for
combating this issue at Fox which is authorized to act on behalf of
Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, the copyright owner of Planet of
the Apes.  Our contact information is: Fox Intellectual Property Department
(310) 369-4260
antipiracy at fox.com
Working with you and our other partners, we hope to be able to identify
and remove infringing files quickly.  The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") and other civil and
criminal statutes provide for severe penalties (including prison
sentences of up to 10 years, forfeiture of equipment, and fines of up to
$2 million per incident) against persons who record and post pirated
copies of films on the Internet.  We intend to pursue and prosecute
infringers to the fullest extent possible in conjunction with the MPAA,
the FBI, the Department of Justice, and through civil lawsuits.  Congress included mechanisms in the DMCA which are designed to allow
copyright owners to prevent and prosecute infringement of their rights
on the Internet.  The DMCA requires copyright owners to notify you, as
the Internet Service Provider, of infringing activities, and imposes the
obligation on ISPs to act expeditiously to remove or disable access to
infringing materials.  This letter is intended, in part, to give you
advance information that you will be receiving additional notices
pursuant to the DMCA from Fox, its representatives or the MPAA. We trust
that we will be able to count on your prompt action in response to such
notices requesting you to disable such infringing postings and/or
downloads and stop the infringement of our rights.
The posting and/or dissemination of unauthorized copies/recordings of
all or part of a copyrighted film on the Internet (excluding trailers
authorized and licensed for such use) infringes the copyrights in both
the motion picture and the soundtrack.  Fox, as owner of all rights
relating to Planet of the Apes, has not authorized any distribution of
the motion picture or its soundtrack over the Internet.  We, therefore,
have a good faith belief that any Internet postings of such video and/or

Wrong headed or not, LEOs are manufactured out of human beings, and
because of this, the spend a considerable amount of time in the Maggot
Academy (tm) being taught the fine points of this very issue.  In fact,
a great majority of an LEO's "education" time is spent instructing them on
how to determine [decide] what is and is not constitutionally protected
{speech, action}.  If they did not use this "ability", they would have to
arrest *everyone*, and let the courts sort out the mess.
Actually, she is the perfect example: she interpreted the constitution her
way.  The "Rule of Law" has to be implemented at the individual [enforcer]
level: therefore, each enforcer is putin the position of having to make
and act on their [constitutional] opinions on a moment to moment basis.
The fact that you [and in this rare case] I agree that Reno is a fascist
sack of shit is completely irrelevent.
Yes.  And if you are at all familiar with the history of 2A case law, you
will understand why the SCOTUS has been so meticulous in avoiding a
ruling.  Of course, our friends [hrmmm... Never thought I'd say THAT] in
Texas may well put an end to the charade soon.
Virtually the entire 2A ablating federal infrastructure is based on a
truly scary "finding" that *any* firearm is the product of Intertate
Commerce, regardless if it has been out of the state in which it was
manufactured.  In fact, IIRC, there is an early 1970's case where a felon
was convicted under federal laws, even though the weapon he posessed was
self-manufactured using components found completely within the state in
which the manufacture took place.  The ruling basically stated that since
the manufacture of the weapon utilized federal notes, there was an
interstate commerce nexus.  Go look: there are *thousands* of these.
Als at the risk of going Choation, what part of "Shall not be
infringed" don't you understand?
No. This is a free market issue.
Again, no.  The market will not support a gun manufacturer that does not
produce reliable weapons.  See above: it is by definition unavoidable.
I don't know what world *you* live in, but you have just described the
world the *rest* of us live in.
Irrelevent.  We are not discussing abstract legal theory, we are
discussing factual implementation.
Nevertheless, *this* is how the world works.
Agreed.

That explains a lot about the California SS.  Down in the United States,
or at least in the few areas I have personal knowledge of, New York (City
PD and State Trooper) and New Mexico, there is a great deal of
constitutional education.  This education is seen as necessary to
"properly" interpret *when* (not if, sadly enough) an LEO may take certain
knew) committed an act that violated the law. You are confusing "civilians" and LEOs.  Only civilians are held to the
personal knowledge standard.  Leos are held to profoundly lower probablity
If you honestly believe this, then someone needs to beat the shit out of
you with a clueclub.  By definition, LEOs are [daily] involved in all
issues, from 1-ad to no-ad...
Please document this assertion.  1/2 is just plain *wrong*.  The tax
issues are restrictive, but not ablating, i.e., if you can afford the tax,
then, *in theory*, you have no problem.   I am talking about totally [2A]
destructive laws, such as felons losing their RIGHT to ownership of
firearms, civilians losing their RIGHT to own "assault
weapons" (interesting note: it is still legal to collect missiles, but not
certain types of rifles - the idiocy continues).
 > > > > >> 	Further
more, what is *constitutionally* an infringement? > >
Yes.  Period.
No it is not: it is directly on point.  There is NO constituional basis
for the government to be able to regulate firearms.  Period.  Whether for
"good", "bad", or indifferent.  There is a very clear constitutional
mandate that any and all firearms be available to "the people" -
period.  Any infringement, even if it is "for my own good" is
unconstituional on it's face.

No.  Assuming that ORBS servers were blocked at the edge (as is the case
here), they have absolutely no way to test for open relays (not that it
would do any good here, as we don't have any).  If ORBS probes are
blocked, ORBS will literally _invent_ the review of "open relay", and
apply it to the "movie" (domain) they never had access to "see".
There is another dark side to ORBS which seems to be missed here:  Most
people's primary complaint about spammers is that they (the spammer) is
making use of network services at someone elses expense, without
permission of the spamee.  ORBS is guilty of the EXACT same "crime" - but,
the ORBS is Politically Correct, so nobody seems to mind...   Hypocrisy in action, eh?

It didn't occur to you that the upstream NSP was contacted because they
are the next in line from the ISP?   Are you saying [with a straight

Disingenuous.  Totally.
Bzzt.  I complained to the upstream ISP, and their upstream NSP.  Normal
practice and procedure: I personally have to look at several thousands of

Look again Declan (clue: the email I complained about *is _clearly_

complain about you: anyone with the reading abilities of an
armchair could see what we were bitching about.  Sorry that UU has an

course, it's obviously *much* more satisfying for you to yell and scream
like a 4 year old who has been rejected from the Romper Room Playtime
Then maybe you need a new provider.  We, like everyone else, gets
complaints.  A responsible upstream is going to actually *examine* any
complaints for validity before taking any action.  If your ISP doesn't
fall into this category then you shouldn't be doing business with them
should you?
Wrong:  *OUR* part.  But unlike us, you are apparently unwilling to accept
your piece of responsibility.  You went off half cocked, with no looking
back, and now it has [rightfully] bitten you in the ass.  You have abused
your position as a "journalist" here.  You have sullied your own

I made an honest mistake, and acknowledged it openly when it was pointed

@_subject: A reasonable editorial assessment of Afghanistan status. 
An amazing editorial piece, considering that it is the very first one I
have seen that didn't have Shrub's balls slapping against the author's
WASHINGTON (Tribune Media Services) -- Almost two months into the war
against terrorism -- and one month into the war against anthrax -- it's
fair to ask: 'how are we doing?' The answer is: 'fabulous!' Just ask
anyone in the White House. Thanks to Lloyd Grove of the Washington Post for assembling this verbal
collage of praise issued by members of the Bush administration to each
other. Let others play the blame game. They're busy playing the praise
game, showering each other with compliments, not always well-deserved. Of course, the praise starts from the top. President Bush boasts: "I've
put together a fabulous administration. I picked a great vice president in
Dick Cheney." He's proud of his Treasury Department, too: "Secretary Paul
O'Neill is doing a fabulous job." And he has no doubt we'll win the
war: "I've got great confidence in the American military." In each case, the truth belies the praise. If the military's doing such a
great job, why -- after three weeks of nonstop, intensive bombing of one
of the poorest countries on earth, with no navy, no air force and only a
ragtag band of soldiers using obsolete weapons -- is the Taliban still in
power? Why do they still control every major city in Afghanistan? What's
left to bomb? And why are Osama bin Laden's whereabouts still unknown? For that matter, if Dick Cheney's doing such a fabulous job, why are his
whereabouts still unknown and why isn't he allowed back into his White
House office? And is Paul O'Neill really doing such a fabulous job when
the nation's suddenly in a recession? The president is also quick to stroke Secretary of State Colin
Powell: "He's done a fabulous job of assembling a coalition of people from
all around the world to fight terror." Nice words, but again, the reality falls short. Of the so-called
coalition, only Britain is contributing man- and firepower. Saudi Arabia
won't let us fly sorties from their soil. Egypt has refused to supply troops. And Pakistan, our most important ally
in the region, is urging the United States to stop bombing. Except for
England, for all practical purposes, we're fighting this war alone. Other Bush team leaders join in self-praise. Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld brags: "We've done a pretty good job of being able to now
function over that country from the air." Which is as meaningless as his
assertion, on the second day of bombing, that we had "run out of
targets." In three weeks, we have learned the same lesson Russia learned
the hard way: Being able to fly military jets safely over Afghanistan is
far from being able to dislodge Afghani fighters from their mountain
strongholds. By the way, where are the massive defections of Taliban fighters we were
told to expect once bombs started dropping? But it's not just the war against terrorism. On the home front too,
fighting anthrax, administration members are lavish with praise. Health
and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson gives kudos to the Centers for
Disease Control: "They're doing a good job of identifying cases that might
be anthrax." And White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card chimes in: "We
have outstanding health care experts that understand this problem and are
addressing it quickly." Tell that to postal workers, who were assured by the CDC there was no need
to wear protective clothing or be tested against anthrax. That was before two mail carriers died from exposure to the disease. Completing the congratulatory circle, Card singles out his boss for
praise: "He is in great shape. He's a very disciplined man. He gets up
very early in the morning. He does his homework. And he works hard during
the day. He exercises, and he sleeps well at night." So, there you have
it. Things must be going well, because not even the Taliban can keep
George Bush from his treadmill. Actually, there are disturbing signs that neither war is going well. The
generals warn we may not be able to defeat the Taliban until November
2002. Secretary Rumsfeld recently said we may never catch Osama bin
Laden. And neither the CDC, the FBI or the CIA have any idea where the
anthrax-laden letters came from. Maybe the Bush administration would do a better job fighting both
terrorists and anthrax if they weren't so busy patting each other on the
back.

Agreed.  As an interesting aside, there is actual case law in New York
that would be on point here (although I can't for the life of me find the
damn citation.  Sandy?).  The NY Court of Appeals ruled that it is not
possible to "disturb the peace of a police officer".  The incident was in
fact someone calling a cop a "pig", and their subsequent arrest for
"disturbing the peace".

According to new federal laws, a non-lethal stun gun *is* in fact a

it seems geared more towards keeping the populace from self-defence.

ROLLING THUNDER
by Bill Bonner
"The bastards have never been bombed like they're going to be bombed this time."
Richard M. Nixon
Some things just don't work as well as you think they should. Arguing with your wife, for example. Or diet plans. Or hair growth tonic. The rhythm method. Psychotherapy. Momentum investing. Handouts to poor people. Strategic air power.
authorities have had high hopes for the persuasive power of dropping bombs on people. It was assumed that a few tons of high explosives, loosed from a passing airplane, would improve your enemy's behavior.
In the first World War, planes were still too callow to allow the weight of serious destruction. But by WWII, planes could get off the ground with enough bombs to really teach someone a lesson...or so it was thought.
The Germans thought they could bring about a change of attitude in Britain by sending over the Luftwaffe each night and bombing grocery stores and theatres as well as ammunition dumps. They did change attitudes, but not the way they hoped. Instead of softening up, the Brits turned a hard face...and mobilized for war with greater resolve.  When the tide turned in the air, and the god of war floated over to the other side, the British and Americans saw an opportunity for a little attitude adjustment on the continent. They reduced Dresden, Koln, and other German cities to rubble. But a study done after the war showed that even this intense bombing did little to slow the German war machine. Railroads were patched together. Production was shifted from one facility to another. The wheels still turned.
Faith in air power remained. Besides, by the 1960s, the analogies of WWII didn't seem to apply - especially to non-industrialized nations with no planes of their own. In the digital mind of U.S. defense secretary McNamara, there was no question about whether or not airpower could do the trick, but what amount of bombing it would take. Robert McNamara made his calculations. He approached the issue as though he were a Fed chief with 650 basis points to work with. How far would he have to go - and at what cost - before the enemy gave up, he But many people saw the obvious problem. There were few targets in Vietnam against which bombs might be effective. Averill Harriman, returning from a fact-
finding mission, warned Kennedy that "we shall replace the French as the colonial force in the area and bleed as the French did."
By 1964, Kennedy sensed that the war was a losing proposition. He wanted out...but he also sensed an election coming up. "I can't do it until 1965 - until after I'm re-elected," said the president. It was "no profile in courage," comments Barbara Tuchman in "The March of Folly." Lyndon Johnson also sensed a problem, but believed he could not "lose" Vietnam to the communists. That would be a stain on his presidency, he believed - a stain darker than a Texas tort lawyer's heart. "I am not going to be the first U.S. President to lose a war," he declared. Charles De Gaulle offered his views, if not his help. America was being drawn into the war on the same illusions as the French 10 years before, he said. The military superiority of a modern nation was useless in a backwater like Vietnam, he noted. It was a "a hopeless place to fight..."; a " rotten country" that would likely destroy the U.S. army just as it had the French. Instead of fighting, the only way out was negotiation, he advised.
Johnson would have none of it. Undersecretary of State George Ball explained to de Gaulle that "that the U.S. did not believe in negotiating until our position on the battlefield was so strong that our enemies would make This presumed, of course, that the war would go in their Alas, it did not. "Reports from Saigon told of progressive crumbling, riots, corruption, anti-American sentiment, neutralist movement by the Buddhists," writes Tuchman. "I feel," declared one American official in Saigon, "as though I were on the deck of the Titanic."
The Johnson Administration decided to raise the stakes. On March 2nd of 1964, a campaign of bombing named "Rolling Thunder" began. And "by April it was apparent that Rolling Thunder was having no visible effect on the enemy's will to fight," Tuchman writes. "Bombing of the supply trails in Laos had not prevented infiltration; Viet Cong raids showed no signs of faltering."
Like another President 36 years later, Johnson decided to bribe as well as bully. More than $1 billion in aid was offered if only North Vietnam would accept U.S. peace terms. But having taken to the air, America found nowhere to set down. Attitudes in North Vietnam hardened under the bombing. Hanoi announced that it would not negotiate until the bombing was stopped. The U.S. said it would not stop bombing until the Viet Cong stopped fighting.
Still, people were as optimistic as investors in a bull market. McNamara, toting up his bombs and trying to quantify war, saw nothing but good coming out of it. It was the kind of war America had to learn to fight, he said, "a limited war...the kind of war we'll likely be facing for the next fifty years." And so it was! The thunder continued to roll. And McNamara continued adding up his figures. A CIA study revealed that each $1 of damage caused to the enemy cost the U.S. $9.60. (Probably a bargain compared to the rate of return on bombing in Afghanistan.) By the end of 1967, the Pentagon had dropped over 1.5 million tons of bombs - already more than the U.S. had used in Europe in all of WWII - and the bombing had scarcely begun.
McNamara was growing uneasy. He didn't like the numbers. Asked to determine how much damage would have to be inflicted upon Ho Chi Minh's forces to bring him to stop the war, the CIA came up with an alarming answer: There was no level of bombing or naval action that would be "so intolerable that the war had to be stopped."
McNamara was a fool. But he was a smart fool. Soon, he had moved on...he resigned from the Pentagon and took his talent for doing dumb things brilliantly to the World Bank. His replacement, Clark Clifford, quickly came to the same conclusion. He saw that "the course we were pursuing was not only endless but hopeless." Johnson, realizing that he had been trapped, withdrew from the race for another term. Vietnam had ruined him.
But the bombing continued. Richard Nixon took up the illusion - that increasing the pressure on Ho Chi Minh...with more bombs...would cause the old man to give up. He intensified the bombing attacks and expanded them into Cambodia. Each bomb dropped may be a losing proposition, perhaps he reasoned, but we can make it up on volume!
The French continued to offer the same opinion. It was a "hopeless enterprise," said Jean Sainteny to Henry Kissinger. That opinion had spread far and wide. The New York Times labeled Nixon's campaign in Cambodia a "Military Hallucination." In a rare occurrence, the Times was right.
Widening the war was an act of folly, opines Barbara Tuchman, "designed to bring down trouble upon the perpetrator...the kind of folly to which governments seem irresistibly drawn as if pulled by a mischievous fate to make the gods laugh."
Nixon knew the war was a hopeless cause. He just wanted to bring the North Vietnamese to the bargaining table in order to win a "peace with honor." How could he do it? He stepped up the bombing with his "Christmas bombing" campaign - the heaviest of the entire war. Did Hanoi finally give up? No, Hanoi persevered. Nixon and Kissinger gave up, signing the Geneva Peace Accords on the 27th of January 1973. The U.S. stock market hit a high on almost that very day...and then fell for the next 21 months, losing half its value. As a percentage of GDP, stocks registered a high of about 90% of GDP in 1968. They did not reach that level again until nearly 30 years later.
Your editor,
Bill Bonner
P.S. Writing about the folly of others gives no immunity from foolishness - neither in your editor, nor in Barbara Tuchman. Your editor's foolishness is on display regularly, his wife assures him.
Tuchman's can be found in the second paragraph of the first page of her book. Wondering why people do obviously stupid things she becomes delusional: "Why does American business insist on 'growth' when it is demonstrably using up the three basics of life on our planet - land, water and unpolluted air?" Using up the planet's land and water? She almost makes McNamara and Johnson look sensible.

(since mid nineties) CP lurker.  As a frequent poster here, the SE
recognized my name, and we started talking - and the salesguy sat there
with his mouth hanging open, stunned at the content of the
conversation.  That was about three months ago.
Last week we met with this team again, and the salesguy, the *naive* one
who was anti-gun, anti-drug, pro-whitehouse, etc., has just purchased his
first firearm, and begun to take active steps to protect his privacy.  It

Right out of a Monty Python piece...
 MI5's secret plan to recruit gerbils as spycatchers
By Michael Smith, Defence Correspondent
(Filed: 30/06/2001)
MI5 considered using a team of highly-trained gerbils to detect spies and
terrorists flying into Britain during the 1970s, Sir Stephen Lander, the
service's director-general, revealed yesterday.
The plan was based on the ability of gerbils to detect a rise in adrenalin
from changes in the scent of human sweat. Sir Stephen said the Israelis
had put the idea into practice, placing gerbil cages to the side of
security checks for travellers at Tel Aviv airport. A suitably placed fan
wafted the scent of the suspect's sweat into the cage.
The gerbils were trained by Pavlovian response to press a lever if they
detected increased adrenalin, receiving food as a reward. The system was
never put into practice by MI5 because the Israelis were forced to abandon
it after they found that the gerbil could not tell the difference between
terrorists and passengers who were scared of flying.
Speaking at a conference at the Public Record Office in Kew, Sir Stephen
said MI5 archives contained a complete volume on the idea - which was
based on Canadian research for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police - written
in the 1970s.
Although Dame Stella Rimington made a practice of speaking publicly in an
attempt to change MI5, yesterday's Missing Dimension conference was only
the second occasion that Sir Stephen has done so.
The conference marks a new PRO exhibition on espionage, Shaken Not
Stirred, starting today, which includes exhibits on a number of spies
including Mata Hari and a spy paid the equivalent of 6.5 million by King
George I to spy on the Stuarts.
The Missing Dimension refers to the fact that most histories are written
before intelligence files have been released and so omit a crucial element
of what occurred and why. Sir Stephen admitted that it would be a long
time before MI5 would be able to release details of its Cold War

And, as you say, it was an unthinking act - for which ONLY you (as a

I'll cry for them - not.  The insurance industry has it pretty
sweet.  They are specifically exempted from anti-trust laws, and are
pretty much free to do as they please.  I seriously doubt there is a
person on this list who has not been screwed at least once by the

Then the industry should cease to write these policies.

As it should be.
Um, pardon me, but isn't the assesment of risk what the industry does for
a living?  Or are they hereby admitting that they in fact operate on some
other basis?
Again, as it should be.
Of course: the insurance industry is merely a form of gambling, and as
such, needs to "balance their book", i.e., charge based on likely risk of
You mean it would have *anti insurance industry* consequences.  At least
be honest here.
Which of course will have to be factored into the rents/leases/development

very significant drop in insurance rates (based on risk of loss in the
flight areas of course.  My rates dropped by almost 2/3rd when I left the

risk across their entire subscriber group, or charge what they need to,

agreed: by both the terrorists from abroad and the terrorists from within
(USG/State Gov, Local Gov/asstd corrupt LEO orgs).
Too late. These costs are already levied on those who live in cities.  If
they don't like it, they can (and will) move to a place where conditions
are more amenable to their lifestyle and financial situation.  Why should
I subsidize someone elses risk so they can live in a [high crime / highly
attractive terrorist target].  These are life choices made by people who
choose to live in these places - it is not my job to pay their way
Yeah, right.  This is the outfit that allowed the S&L debacle of the 80's
to thrive.  I am not keen to using a model of modern corruption as a model
for anything else that I have to [also] pay for.
Again, as it should be.   Now of course, the FDIC and it's ilk have
created a situation where "banks" can bilk billions of dollars from those
who don't even do business with them (through the forced application of
force to collect the "taxes" which pay for the likes of the FDIC.
If bankers were responsible for their own fuck ups, we'd have a much
better banking system.
This is simple bullshit.  If the insurance industry wants to provide
insurance with collosal risk, they can simply charge collosal premiums.
And then reintroduced by the FDIC encouraged "bailout".
So?  The assumption of risk is a business decision, like all others.  It
must balance many different things, including the risk of terrorists,
police officer payouts, consumer confidence/spending, and a myriad of
other things.  If the risk of financial loss is greater than the risk of
financial gain, then you do the business.  Otherwise, you don't - unless
this logical balance is disturbed by the kind of drivel we are seeing here
(the requiring of those [relatively] not in risk to assume the risk of the
person who is *supposed* to be balancing these diverse risks him/herself.
Dumb?  No.  The actuaries merely underestimated the actual level of risk,
and as a result the industry had to payout.  Thats what it is all about.
Why not?  Be precise: what's "not right" about making a person assume the
risks of their own actions?
Or, as I pointed out above, the industry can do this for themselves.  It
is not governments place to be acting as an insurance business: this is
forcing those of us who do not believe the assumption of the insurance
risk is a wise move to participate in it anyway, usually to the detriment
of those who [as business persons as well as individuals] would NEVER
consider underwriting these risks.  This is theft, pure and simple.  Yeah, right: look at what "no fault insurance" did to places like New
Huh?  Oh yeah, I get it.  If the USG "covers" war losses, there will
likely be less concern and flack from Joe Six.
By whom?
Theft under threat of violence is hardly an "innovative solution".
Agreed.  When governments stop practicing terrorism, it will no longer be
a problem which can claim a moral high ground, and the incidenc will
likely decline.  Until then, if the insurance industry wishes the public
to underwrite their losses, then they had better be prepared to also hand
over any profits.
Actuaries.  Cost == risk.
Bullshit.  This was written for the insurance industry.

According to the registry, their record was modified yesterday (24
November).  In addition, I am unable to reach either of their authoritative name
servers - their upstream may in fact be off the air completely.  With the
recent change in their record, it is possible they made changes to their
dns server addresses, and the new addressed were botched in the process
(something I went through several weeks ago - it appears to be quite
difficult to get the new registrars to properly move dns hosts).
I guess the next step would be email to their admins, and possibly a NANOG

 I know there's a transparent proxy on my ISP and apparently it attaches

 Anonymiser happily copies this field to its own http request. Actually
 it will pass along any field sent with your request, which makes sense
 for "Accept-..." stuff but is obviously a bad ideia for anything else.   So beware if you trust this service and there's an unknown proxy
 somewhere along the wire. Please note this experience was with
 Anonymiser.com's free service. I would like to know if anyone paying
 for it can confirm this.
  To try it: launch netcat on your port 80 (nc -l -p 80), telnet to

While I agree with you in principal, it would not be an easy thing to do

settled that a president may invoke these powers during times of _declared_
war.  Although congress declined a formal declaration, they did provide a
defacto one with their support and authorization of military force ditty.  It
is unlikely that *any* supreme court, much less the sitting one, would deny
Shrub the argument that the country is in a state of war, and therefore has
the requisite autority as the sitting CIC.
The more plausible avenue for legal attack on these two rodents would lie in
the 1200 or so persons detained without even the most basic of constitutional
protections, as well as the current "decision" to monitor [formerly]
privileged [attorney-client] communications.  Also look for legal fodder in

DEA WONï¿½T PUNISH AGENTS WHO FAILED TO DISCLOSE LYING BY INFORMER CHAMBERS
Nobody will be disciplined for letting St. Louis-based drug snitch
Andrew Chambers lie under oath throughout 16 years of government
testimony, Asa Hutchinson, the new head of the DEA, disclosed in an
interview with the Post-Dispatch.
But he vowed that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration would never
again give informers the free rein that Chambers abused.
". . . It hurts the agency," Hutchinson said, referring to Chambersï¿½
lying in testimony about his background and arrest record. The testimony
has compromised dozens of DEA investigations.
Hutchinson said no agents have been punished because an investigation
determined that it was the DEAï¿½s own policies that failed.
Chambers, 44, grew up in University City. Before his suspension last
year, he was the most activeï¿½and one of the highest paidï¿½undercover
operatives in the DEAï¿½s history.
"Chambers abused his position with us, and we didnï¿½t have the systems in
place to keep the checks and balances on that," Hutchinson said last week.
He said heï¿½s confident the right checks are now in place:
* The DEA has set up a central registry to keep track of informers who
testify in more than one place. Beginning in 1984, when Chambers was
recruited at the agencyï¿½s Clayton office, he helped arrest more than 400
drug suspects in 31 cities. He also lied under oath at least 16 times,
but the DEA says its agents either didnï¿½t know or, if they did, didnï¿½t
tell their colleagues elsewhere.
* * All agents have been ordered to turn over the complete records of
their snitches to prosecutors and defense attorneys. Some agents were in
courtrooms when Chambers lied but never reported it. Others did, but the
agency kept a lid on it.
How could no one be punished after years of courtroom lying?
The DEAï¿½s own records show that senior officials at headquarters fought
a two-year court fight to keep secret Chambers records: that he
repeatedly lied in court when he claimed he had never been arrested or
convicted, inflated his educational background and claimed he paid taxes
on his DEA earnings - more than $1.8 million.
The DEA spent months investigating itself. The report of that
investigation, obtained by the Post-Dispatch in May, concluded that at
least one DEA supervisor in the field should have done more to report
Chambersï¿½ courtroom lying.
In July, a DEA spokesman said two employees were under investigation.
They are now identified only as an agent and a supervisor.
"A thorough investigation was done, and there was no finding that would
result in a disciplinary action," DEA spokesman Michael Chapman said Friday.
Critics see a cover-up
"Iï¿½m stunned that so much government wrongdoing meant so little to the
government," said Dean Steward. Heï¿½s a former federal public defender in
California who led a three-year effort to make the Justice Department
disclose the extent of Chambersï¿½ lying - and the Justice Departmentï¿½s complicity.
"Had this been a major corporation, heads would roll," Steward added.
Hutchinson acknowledged that the scandal had hurt the DEA: "Whenever you
lose the credibility of an informant . . . it hurts the agency."
But in the end, he said, it appeared to be "a failure of policy versus a
failure of personnel."
He said he wasnï¿½t familiar with all of the details because he became DEA
administrator just over a month ago. He reports to Attorney General John
Ashcroft, who also took office months after Chambers was suspended,
after disclosures in the Post-Dispatch.
Hutchinson said undercover snitches are crucial, both to his agency in
the war on drugs, as well as to the countryï¿½s new war on terrorism.
"Youï¿½ve got to use informants. . . . Otherwise, you canï¿½t get the job done."
He said the DEA wonï¿½t use Chambers again in any capacity - despite
accolades from dozens of agents who considered him the best.
Hereï¿½s how the DEA investigation describes Chambers: ". . . Motivated by
money, thrill, camaraderie and a sense of self-righteousness."
The DEA chief disagreed with those who say Chambers is too valuable to lose.
"You donï¿½t lose anything by cutting that out," Hutchinson said. "You
want to balance proper accountability and checks and balances with
getting the job done."

Sent: 9/25/01
Dear all:
It is time to get coordinated and aggressive with the new round of peer to
peer services. The amount of music being downloaded is, as you know, reaching unprecedented levels. Since college started last week Morpheus traffic was
up to 19 million downloads per day. AND THAT'S JUST MORPHEUS. With the
imminent launch of legitimate subscription services we have to get our customers
back. I know you want your new businesses to be successful. So do I. Given the overwhelming volume of these alternative services, RIAA can't handle all
of the enforcement alone. If they are not controlled more effectively and
consumers redirected to legitimate offerings, there won't be new businesses. That's obvious. You are all competitors, but you have common interests in
enforcement. Help me help you. I'd like to have a meeting at the RIAA in October as soon as possible. If you agree to participate, I will have my assistant try and
work with schedules to get a date that works. I want to keep the meeting small to start (we can expand participation to
other companies later). We need to discuss: 1. Spoofing and/or interdiction methods for existing peer to peers -
(perhaps by adding promotional messages about the launch of various new systems) 2. A PR campaign
3. We will share the latest legal strategies and RIAA's thinking on
options Please plan on attending. I am cautious about sending alternates because
we need people who have the ability to make decisions and commit to spending. Best regards, Hilary

@_subject: RIAA Legal Analysis 
transcription are likely my own - see the original at
My favorite part is the last paragraph, where they talk of getting
FastTrack to roll over on MusicCity!
PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL/ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT
We have distributed various legal and technical memoranda that describe
the KaZaA network and the potential legal claims against the entities
offering this peer-to-peer service. This memorandum seeks to consolidate
our current learning into a single document. Accordingly, detailed below
are: (a) a brief overview of the relevant entities and the KaZaA network
architecture; (b) the facts supporting our legal claims; and (c) a going
forward strategy recommendation.
I. Overview of Entities and Architecture
FastTrack is the Netherlands based software company that developed the
software code library used to create the KaZaA peer-to-peer networks.
KaZaA was the first application to use the FastTrack code. FastTrack later
licensed its code to MusicCity (MusicCity dubbed its system Morpheus) and
Grockster. The principals behind FastTrack are Niklas Zennstrom and Janis
Friis- - Two young technology developers who are primarily interested in
the development of their technology and who have privately funded their
operation. MusicCity is being run by Steve Griffin, but with heavy
influence by Timberline Venture Partners, the independently managed
Northwest Affiliate of Draper Fisher Jurvetson.  Timberline owns 65% of
MusicCity and is very involved in running the company.
The FastTrack network designates (perhaps automatically) certain peers -
more powerful computers with high-bandwidth connections - as "supernodes."
[because of the systems encrypted communication, we are unable to
determine how supernodes are designated]. Several hundred "ordinary" peers
connect to any one supernode. A supernode also connects to other
supernodes. [because of the systems encrypted communication, we are unable
to determine how one supernode knows how to locate other supernodes].
Vidius found that when one of its machines was in supernode status, it was
connected to approximately 25 other supernodes. The supernode functions in
Napster-like fashion as a local search hub, building an index of the files
being shared by each peer connected to it, and processing search requests
on behalf of those peers. Supernode queries other supernodes to fulfill a
search request, but does not query peers serviced by other supernodes
(such a step is unnecessary because the supernodes index all files
available among the peers they service). The effect of this architecture
is to create a relatively small peer-to-peer network of supernodes, each
of which in turn functions as a miniature central server for hundreds of
other users. As in Napster and Gnutella, file transfers in the FastTrack
system are purely peer-to-peer, and involve neither the central server nor
any supernode.
Significantly, the FastTrack system encrypts all communications (a)
between a peer and the log-in server, (b) between a peer and its
supernode, (c) between a supernode and the central servers, and (d)
between supernodes [we do not know the nature of the encryption]. However,
peer-to-peer communications associated with downloading a file are
unencrypted. Presumably, the encryption scheme was created, and is
controlled, by the developer of the application - FastTrack. By encrypting
the communication, the developer has ensured that the network remains
"closed" and accessible only through the KaZaA, Morpheus, or Grokster
applications (and any future licensees of the FastTrack technology).
KaZaA, MusicCity, and Grokster each operate a central log-in server. The
addresses of these servers are hard-coded into the application. At log-in,
the peer sends one packet of data to the server, and the server returns
two packets. The transmissions presumably involve log-in information from
the peer and acknowledgement and confirmation from the server. This
function appears to be similar for each of the three entities. In
addition, Vidius reports that, at least with the KaZaA application, there
is a communication regularly every 12 hours between the log-in (.37)
server and the user (whether in peer or supernode status) [we do not know
the nature of these communications].
Notably, the log-in server is not essential to a peers use of the network.
If the log-in server is not available, the application nevertheless
attempts to connect to a supernode using the list contained in the
registry (whether it is the preset list for a new user or the most recent
update for a repeat user).
After log-in, the peer then attempts to connect to a supernode, using a
list of supernode addresses stored in the software application. That list
is supplied by the application developer, and is identical across KaZaA,
Morpheus, and Grokster. The list includes IP addresses at universities and
other institutions such as the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The list of
supernodes has changed with each new version of the application. In the
newest version of the application, the list also includes an IP address at
Disney, rnd11-200.rd.wdi.disney.com. The IP addresses listed in the
registry do not all function as supernodes at any given time; in fact,
most do not. After logging in, a peer works through the list in its
registry until its finds a supernode it can connect to. When the peer
connects to a supernode for the first time, it receives an updated list of
supernodes, which overwrites the preset list in the registry. [we do not
know how the suprnode obtains this updated list of supernodes to
distribute]. The list of supernodes in the registry is then updated every
time the peer connects to a supernode. Thus, a peer always has the most
recent possible list of computers that have functioned as supernodes,
thereby increasing the odds of a successful connection during the next
session. After initially making contact with a supernode, a peer may be
shunted around the network as the system attempts to match the peer with
the most appropriate supernode.
If the registry is somehow corrupted, the application causes the peer to
contact another server controlled by KaZaA, supernode.kazaa.com
(213.248.112.38). This address is also hard-coded into the application.
This means that the KaZaA network maintains a dynamic list of active
supernodes [we do not know how this happens]. Upon connecting to that
server, the peer will receive a list of known supernodes. All three
applications direct the user to the KaZaA (.38) server in this
KaZaA operates another server in addition to the log-in (.37) server and
the (.38) server described above. That is alpha.kazaa.com
(213.248.112.34), the address of which, as with the other two, is
hard-coded into the application.  The (.34) server communicates with
supernodes [we do not know the nature of the communication]. During an
interval when a Vidius machine was acting as a supernode, there were 12
different attempts by the (.34) server to connect to the supernode. Vidius
reports that in a completed transaction the (.34) server sends
approximately 1600 bytes of information to the supernode. In addition, as
noted above, a supernode makes periodic connection with the KaZaA log-in
(.37) server. Vidius hypothesizes that there is a loop between the (.34)  server, the (.37) server, and the supernode, which is highly suggestive of
some sort of control mechanism - the nature of which must remain unknown
until the substance of the communications can be analyzed.
Vidius found that "netsplits" or disconnections sometimes occur on the
FastTrack network. The system contains some mechanism to resolve such
disconections by redirecting peers away from a supernode that has become
detached from the network and back to a supernode on the network.
Supernodes that are split from the network also eventually reconnect to
it, but that reconnection takes 10-15 minutes longer than the reconnection
of peers. Vidius believes that this timing differential indicates some
control of the reconnection process that is external to the client
Among the supernodes on the new preset list is one at s1grokster.com,
which resides at the same location as the Grokster log-in server. Those
computer functions like an ordinary supernode, compiling indexes of
available files and processing search requests. Vidius was able to connect
to that supernode, and used it to find and download numerous movie and MP3
II. Elements of Claims and Proof
1. Contributory Infringement
Liability for contributory infringement attaches to "one who, with
knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes or materially
contributes to the infringing conduct of another . . . [L]iability exists
if the defendant engages in personal conduct that encourages or assists
the infringement." A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004, 1014
(9th Cir. 2001).
o FastTrack sought to obtain licensing from NVPI and was referred to
individual   members of the organization.
o NVPI wrote to FastTrack and provided notice that its conduct was
infringing   and that it should obtain the necessary licensing.
o RIAA wrote letter to MusicCity when it was an OpenNap system and placed   MusicCity on notice of infringing conduct. The same principals contacted
by          the RIAA are still in place at MusicCity.
o In discussion with General Counsel of Copyright.net, KaZaA CEO
acknowledged   exchange of copyrighted content and stated looking into filters,
particularly   for child porn.
o Press has raised issue of exchange of copyrighted content with company   principals.
o Widespread presence of copyrighted materials on system.
o Message Boards discuss available music, films, and software.   MusicCity employees participate in message board discussions and CEO   acknowledges MusicCity controls message boards.
[should we provide notice by letters and when?]
Material Contribution
o FastTrack creates and licenses software primarily used for the
reproduction     and distribution of copyrighted works.
o FastTrack created and controls encryption that ensures that the network     remains closed and insulated from outside monitoring.
o Provides a dynamic list of available supernodes where content can be   exchanged (possibly through the .38 server).
o Continually updates the list of available supernodes and communicates
that   information to users (likely through the .34 server).
o FastTrack, MusicCity and Grockster maintain log-in servers.
o Maintains the s1grokster.com server which acts as a supernode (and by   definition maintains a file index).
o Resolves netsplits and other system problems (likely through the .34
Vicarious Infringement
o Vicarious liability arises when the defendant "has the right and ability
to   supervise the infringing activity and also has a direct financial
interest     in such activities." Napster, 239 F.3d at 1022.
Right and Ability to Supervise
o KaZaA, MusicCity, and Grokster all expressly reserve the right to limit
the   number of files that users make available or access and to terminate
users   who infringe intellectual property rights or violate other laws.
o MusicCity also reserves the right to remove or disable links to
allegedly   infringing material.
o Network limits MP3 files to certain bitrate
o MusicCity implemented a filter for child pornography.
o Steve Griffin claims to have cooperated with police in limiting the
exchange   of child pornography.
Financial Benefit
o Generate advertising revenue based on user base.
o Steve Griffin expressed to head of Rock the Vote that he cant stop   infringements so he intends to make money from it.
o Zennstrom acknowledged to the press that FastTrack is making money.
o The services have a rapidly growing user base and according to CNETs   download.com is the most popular software on the net.
o MusicCity obtaining additional funding from Timberline Venture Partners.
III. Recommendation
We have solid claims against FastTrack, MusicCity, and Grockster of
secondary liability for copyright infringement. The claims are not as
strong as those against Napster, but they are also not so remote as to be
Our claims would likely be strengthened by learning more about the
designation of supernodes and the content of communications within the
system. However, the encryption of this communication precludes further
learning absent cooperation from one of these companies or court ordered
discovery. In that regard, we recently learned that FastTrack is very
interested in exploring alternatives to litigation and its principals are
willing to sit down with the record companies to discuss ways of resolving
any dispute. FastTrack is willing to sell the company and the technology,
or enter into a licensing arrangement. FastTrack is also willing to
implement filtering technologies to prevent infringements. We have also
learned that MusicCity is looking for the litigation and would like for us
to file suit.
Thus, we recommend (1) filing claims against FastTrack, MusicCity, and
Grockster, (2) immediately thereafter initiating discussions with
FastTrack about resolving our claims in a way that will provide us with
useful information and testimony against MusicCity, and if possible obtain
FastTracks cooperation in shutting down or converting MusicCity and
Grokster, and (4)  continue forward with litigation against MusicCity,
Grokster, and potentially Timberline Venture Partners.

Dear all:
It is time to get coordinated and aggressive with the new round of peer
to peer services. The amount of music being downloaded is, as you know,
reaching unprecedented levels. Since college started last week Morpheus
traffic was up to 19 million downloads per day. AND THAT'S JUST
MORPHEUS. With the imminent launch of legitimate subscription services
we have to get our customers back. I know you want your new businesses to be successful. So do I. Given the
overwhelming volume of these alternative services, RIAA can't handle all
of the enforcement alone. If they are not controlled more effectively
and consumers redirected to legitimate offerings, there won't be new
businesses. That's obvious. You are all competitors, but you have common interests in enforcement.
Help me help you. I'd like to have a meeting at the RIAA in October as
soon as possible. If you agree to participate, I will have my assistant
try and work with schedules to get a date that works. I want to keep the meeting small to start (we can expand participation
to other companies later). We need to discuss: 1. Spoofing and/or interdiction methods for existing peer to peers -
(perhaps by adding promotional messages about the launch of various new
systems) 2. A PR campaign
3. We will share the latest legal strategies and RIAA's thinking on
options Please plan on attending. I am cautious about sending alternates because
we need people who have the ability to make decisions and commit to
spending. Best regards, Hilary

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...

   Update: Investigation of Anthrax Associated with Intentional Exposure and
Interim Public Health Guidelines, October 2001
     On October 4, 2001, CDC and state and local public health authorities
reported a case of inhalational anthrax in Florida (1). Additional cases of
anthrax subsequently have been reported from Florida and New York City. This
report updates the findings of these case investigations, which indicate
that infections were caused by the intentional release of Bacillus
anthracis. This report also includes interim guidelines for postexposure
prophylaxis for prevention of inhalational anthraxand other information to
assist epidemiologists, clinicians, and laboratorians responding to
intentional anthrax exposures.
     For these investigations, a confirmed case of anthrax was defined as 1)
a clinically compatible case of cutaneous, inhalational, or gastrointestinal
illness* that is laboratory confirmed by isolation of B. anthracis from an
affected tissue or site or 2) other laboratory evidence of B. anthracis
infection based on at least two supportive laboratory tests. A suspected
case was defined as 1) a clinically compatible case of illness without
isolation of B. anthracis and no alternative diagnosis, but with laboratory
evidence of B. anthracis by one supportive laboratory test or 2) a
clinically compatible case of anthrax epidemiologically linked to a
confirmed environmental exposure, but without corroborative laboratory
evidence of B. anthracis infection.
     Laboratory criteria for diagnosis of anthrax consist of 1) isolation
and confirmation of B. anthracis from a clinical specimen collected from an
affected tissue or site or 2) other supportive laboratory tests, including
(a) evidence of B. anthracis DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from
specimens collected from an affected tissue or site, (b) demonstration of B.
anthracis in a clinical specimen by immunohistochemical staining, or (c)
other laboratory tests (e.g., serology) that may become validated by
laboratory confirmation.
     On October 2, the Palm Beach County Health Department (PBCHD) and the
Florida Department of Health (FDOH) were notified of a possible anthrax case
in Palm Beach County. The suspected case was identified when a gram stain of
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed a gram-positive bacilli. An epidemiologic
investigation was initiated by FDOH, PBCHD, and the FDOH state laboratory.
The state laboratory and CDC confirmed B. anthracis from a culture of CSF on
October 4. Later the same day, FDOH and CDC epidemiologists and laboratory
workers arrived in Palm Beach County to assist PBCHD with the investigation.
As of October 16, two confirmed cases of inhalational anthrax have been
     The index patient was a 63-year-old male resident of Palm Beach County
who sought medical care at a local hospital on October 2 with fever and
altered mental status. Despite antibiotic therapy, his clinical condition
deteriorated rapidly, and he died on October 5. An autopsy performed on
October 6 confirmed the cause of death as inhalational anthrax. An
investigation revealed no obvious exposures to B. anthracis.
     On October 1, the second patient, a 73-year-old co-worker of the index
patient, was admitted to a local hospital for pneumonia. On October 5, a
nasal swab was obtained from the patient that yielded a positive culture for
B. anthracis. Subsequent testing revealed positive PCR tests for B.
anthracis in hemorrhagic pleural fluid and reactive serologic tests. The
patient remains hospitalized on antibiotic therapy. Enhanced case finding
and retrospective and prospective surveillance systems were initiated in
Palm Beach, and surrounding counties. Environmental assessments and sampling
were performed at the index patient's home, work site, and travel
destinations for the 60 days preceding symptom onset. Environmental sampling
revealed B. anthracis contamination of the work site, specifically
implicating mail or package delivery. Environmental samples of other
locations the patient visited, including extensive sampling of his home,
were negative.
     Questionnaires were administered to employees at the index patient's
work site. Postexposure prophylaxis was administered, and nasal swabs were
obtained from those with exposure to the work site for >1 hour since August
1. Of 1,075 nasal swabs performed, one was positive for B. anthracis.
Environmental and co-worker testing indicated contamination of specific
locations at the work site. The investigation and environmental sampling are
New York
     On October 9, the New York City Department of Health notified CDC of a
person with a skin lesion consistent with cutaneous anthrax. CDC sent a team
to New York City to provide epidemiologic and laboratory support to local
health officials. As of October 16, two persons with confirmed cases of
cutaneous anthrax have been identified. One person with confirmed anthrax
was a 38-year-old woman who had handled a suspicious letter postmarked
September 18 at her workplace. The letter contained a powder that
subsequently was confirmed to contain B. anthracis. On September 25, the
patient had a raised lesion on the chest, which over the next 3 days
developed surrounding erythema and edema. By September 29, the patient
developed malaise and headache. On October 1, a clinician examined the
patient and described an approximately 5 cm long oval-shaped lesion with a
raised border, small satellite vesicles, and profound edema. The lesion was
nonpainful and was associated with left cervical lymphadenopathy. Serous
fluid from the lesion was obtained and was negative by gram stain and
culture. The patient was prescribed oral ciprofloxacin. Over the next
several days, the lesion developed a black eschar, and a biopsy was obtained
and sent to CDC for testing. The tissue was positive by immunohistochemical
staining for the cell wall antigen of B. anthracis.
     The other person with confirmed cutaneous anthrax was a 7-month-old
infant who visited his mother's workplace on September 28. The next day, the
infant had an apparently nontender, massively edematous, weeping skin lesion
on his left arm; he was treated with intravenous antibiotics. Over the next
several days, the lesion became ulcerative and developed a black eschar;
clinicians presumptively attributed the lesion to a spider bite. The
infant's clinical course was complicated by hemolytic anemia and
thrombocytopenia, requiring intensive care. The diagnosis of cutaneous
anthrax was first considered on October 12 after the announcement of the
other confirmed anthrax case in New York City. A serum specimen collected on
October 2 was positive for B. anthracis by PCR testing at CDC; a skin biopsy
obtained on October 13 was positive by immunohistochemical staining at CDC
for the cell wall antigen of B. anthracis. No suspicious letter with powder
was identified at the mother's workplace. Both patients were treated with
ciprofloxacin and are clinically improving.
     B. anthracis grew from swabs (two nasal and one facial skin swab) from
three other persons, suggesting exposure to anthrax. One of the exposures
was in a law enforcement officer who brought the letter containing B.
anthracis from the index patient's workplace to the receiving laboratory.
The other two exposures were in technicians who had processed the letter in
the laboratory. Environmental sampling in both workplaces is ongoing and
investigations of other exposed persons continue.

Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that four confirmed
cases of anthrax have resulted from intentional delivery of B. anthracis
spores through mailed letters or packages. These are the first confirmed
cases of anthrax associated with intentional exposure in the United States
and represent a new public health threat.
     Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by the sporeforming
bacterium B. anthracis. It occurs most frequently as an epizootic or
enzootic disease of herbivores (e.g., cattle, goats, or sheep) that acquire
spores from direct contact with contaminated soil. Humans usually become
infected through direct contact with B. anthracis spores from infected
animals or their products (e.g., goat hair), resulting in cutaneous anthrax
(2) (Box 1). Inhalational and gastrointestinal are other forms of the
disease in the natural setting (4,5). Humantohuman transmission has not been
     Clinical laboratorians should be alert to the presence of Bacillus
species in patient specimens. In particular, laboratorians should suspect B.
anthracis when the specimen is from a previously healthy patient with a
rapidly progressive respiratory illness or a cutaneous ulcer. If B.
anthracis is suspected, laboratories should immediately notify the
health-care provider and local and state public health staff. For rapid
identification of B. anthracis, state and local health departments should
access the Laboratory Response Network for Bioterrorism (LRN). LRN links
state and local public health laboratories with advanced capacity
laboratories---including clinical, military, veterinary, agricultural,
water, and food-testing laboratories. Laboratorians should contact their
state public health laboratory to identify their local LRN representative.
     Postexposure prophylaxis is indicated to prevent inhalational anthrax
after a confirmed or suspected aerosol exposure. When no information is
available about the antimicrobial susceptibility of the implicated strain of
B. anthracis, initial therapy with ciprofloxacin or doxycycline is
recommended for adults and children (Table 1). Use of tetracyclines and
fluoroquinolones in children has adverse effects. The risks for these
adverse effects must be weighed carefully against the risk for developing
life-threatening disease. As soon as penicillin susceptibility of the
organism has been confirmed, prophylactic therapy for children should be
changed to oral amoxicillin 80 mg/kg of body mass per day divided every 8
hours (not to exceed 500 mg three times daily). B. anthracis is not
susceptible to cephalosporins or to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and these
agents should not be used for prophylaxis.

*Cutaneous illness is characterized by a skin lesion evolving from a papule,
through a vesicular stage, to a depressed black eschar; edema, erythema, or
necrosis without ulceration may be present. Inhalational illness is
characterized by a brief prodrome resembling a "nonspecific febrile" illness
that rapidly progresses to a fulminant illness with signs of sepsis and/or
respiratory failure, often with radiographic evidence of mediastinal
widening; signs of bacterial meningitis may be present. Gastrointestinal
illness is characterized by severe abdominal pain usually accompanied by
bloody vomiting or diarrhea followed by fever and signs of septicemia.
BOX 1. Clinical forms of anthrax
     Clinical Forms of Anthrax
     The following clinical descriptions of anthrax are based on experience
in adults. The clinical presentation of anthrax in infants is not well
     Inhalational. Inhalational anthrax begins with a brief prodrome
resembling a viral respiratory illness followed by development of hypoxia
and dyspnea, with radiographic evidence of mediastinal widening.
Inhalational anthrax is the most lethal form of anthrax and results from
inspiration of 8,000--50,000 spores of Bacillus anthracis (3). The
incubation period of inhalational anthrax among humans typically ranges from
1--7 days but may be possibly up to 60 days. Host factors, dose of exposure,
and chemoprophylaxis may affect the duration of the incubation period.
Initial symptoms include mild fever, muscle aches, and malaise and may
progress to respiratory failure and shock; meningitis frequently develops.
Case-fatality estimates for inhalational anthrax are extremely high, even
with all possible supportive care including appropriate antibiotics.
     Cutaneous. Cutaneous anthrax is characterized by a skin lesion evolving
from a papule, through a vesicular stage, to a depressed black eschar. The
incubation period ranges from 1--12 days. The lesion is usually painless,
but patients also may have fever, malaise, headache, and regional
lymphadenopathy. The case fatality rate for cutaneous anthrax is 20%
without, and <1% with, antibiotic treatment.
     Gastrointestinal. Gastrointestinal anthrax is characterized by severe
abdominal pain followed by fever and signs of septicemia. This form of
anthrax usually follows after eating raw or undercooked contaminated meat
and can have an incubation period of 1--7 days. An oropharyngeal and an
abdominal form of the disease have been described. Involvement of the
pharynx is usually characterized by lesions at the base of the tongue,
dysphagia, fever, and regional lymphadenopathy. Lower bowel inflammation
typically causes nausea, loss of appetite, and fever followed by abdominal
pain, hematemesis, and bloody diarrhea. The case-fatality rate is estimated
to be 25%--60%. The effect of early antibiotic treatment on the
case-fatality rate is not established.

There's actually two questions implied here:
whe the event(s) take place;
I can't address number 1 directly, but I can address number two from first
hand experience.
In 1983 I was questioned by a (New York) police officer, who interrupted
my quite open and obvious dictation into a hand held microcassette
recorder to do it.  Since he saw the thing in my hand, and did not ask me
to turn it off, I let it run during what was essentially a "Terry Stop".
When the Terry stop escalated, and I was ordered to follow the officer for
more questioning, I asked him, while holding out the recorder for the
answer, whether I was under arrest.  Answer: no.  Followed by "Am I free
to go?".  Answer no.  "Sir, I believe these two conditions are mutually
exclusive: either I am under arrest, or I am free to go.  As I have things
to do, I need to know which it is, so that I may either go do them, or
call my attorney to join us".
My reward was a crushed microcassette recorder, a "missing" cassette (he
claimed the recorder was both damaged and empty at the time he first
encountered it), and an arrest (and conviction no less!).
On the way to central booking, he helped himself to my pocket change to
pay for the coffee and doughnuts for him and his three buddies (they
actually stopped en-route, leaving me cuffed in the car alone for about
20 minutes).
So, in a nutshell, expect that the recorder will be "empty", and quite
damaged when/if it is ever returned to you (which mine wasn't, even after
multiple applications).

While I agree with your assessment that he has "earned killing", I do not
see how my failure to kill him earns doubt - one does not necessarily
follow the other (in the real world anyway - the "ideal" world is
something completely different).
I did not, and likely will never have the opportunity to kill the bastard.  Nevertheless, this was a very radicalizing event in my life, and was the
foundation upon which many of my future "incidents" were based.  In a way,
the guy did me a favor: he permanently opened my eyes to the Real World.
His reward, and society's reward, is that I am now a fervently
anti-government/anti-LEO prick, who will never again work within the
system (or for that matter, do anything to assist it in any way, shape, or
form).  I firmly believe that he and his ilk will get the killing they so richly
deserve when enough people finally wake up and form a [political] critical

I submit that this has already been long abandoned, however, I am more
interested at the moment in the "truth serum" premise.  My understanding
(from questioning on this topic in the distant past with an
MD/"shrink") is that the sodium thiopental/pentobarbital/etc. "truth
serum" is an urban legend.  He was quite specific that the drug was a
definite aid to relaxing patients, and "allowing" them to go where they
_wanted_ to (psychiatrically speaking) with much less "work", but that
"pentothal interviews" were very much not free-will altering devices.
At the risk of being told to go google (which I guess I'll do in a
moment), does anyone have any information either contrary to this, or
possibly of another "truth serum" that would fit the stated bill?  I really suspect this truth serum business is just psywar in action...

@ "The nonflagellated vegetative cell is large (1-8 microns in length,
1-1.5 microns in breadth). Spore size is approximately 1 micron."
The germinated B anthracis is _larger_ than the _singular_ spore
(dormant) state (the gram positive rod). The spores are being milled to
the "spherical" and "singular" spore size, around 1 micron. The spores
unmilled may clump greatly (as reported for the Boca Raton letter) as
part of the process that was used to cause sporulation of the growing B
anthracis stock. Also they clump because of electrostatic charge (which
is now being reported to have been defeated).
My question is how do the TB and HEPA masks function with 1 micron size
particles that are  electrostatically neutral. I would assume that all
these masks were designed from the premise that small particles will
always have a electrostatic charges--since only artificially made
particles (requiring great technical skill) can be made
electrostatically neutral.
Is the filter a physical barrier at 0.3 microns? Or is this a physical +
electrostatic barrier at 0.3 microns (which means that the physical
component may be much greater)?

*written words*.  The anti-imaging laws are justified on the grounds that
producing the stuff requires, by definition, a child, and therefore,
outlawing the stuff "Saves Children".  As I understand this story, the guy had a diary which contained written
descriptions of things he would *like* to do, not a photo album of kids
bent over a table...
Big difference.  A a "journalist", I'm sure you can see where this not so
subtle difference lies...

It did not appear [to me] that you were attempting to defend the law.
I did not elide this snippet below.  That said, I came in from an 18++ hour day at work, and skimmed through my
700++ emails for the day, focusing primarily on those threads of
interest.  As there were an unusually large number of them today, I did
stay closest to the most recent as a kind of "digest" attempt - if the
below paragraph was somewhere in the original thread, it was gone by
the time I responded.
That said, I will respond to this now.
An outgrowth would imply that it is along a continuum that has the same
basic "footing".  All of your above examples, from the traditional "kiddie
porn" to the Feinswine dirty pixel laws deal with visual imagery of the
photographic "kind".  What we have here is distinctly different: no
pictures of *any* kind, real or constructed, *unless*, we are no
prosecuting the imagery that we are assuming is present in the mind of the
author.  He is using *words*, not *imagery*.
I *am* upset at the entire framework.  Regardless of which  (or both) of
these footings are argued as somehow "morally valid/justified/whatever",
what it boils down to is the outlawing of *information*.  The outlawing of
DATA is a Pure Thought Crime.  If we wanted to "Protect The Children" we would make the *act* of engaging
a minor in an *act* of nude photography/sex/dope smoking/whatever a
serious crime, and we would then enforce it to the teeth.  That we do not
speaks volumes about who we are "protecting".
The "drug war" is the perfect analogy here: it is the posession, which is
inherently victimless, which is the greater evil under the "judgement" of
our "society".
Posession of *anything* is a victimless "crime", and should NEVER be

While I am unsure of the _current_ status, as of 1989/90 it was at least
OK to place severe restrictions on *how* one did business with them.  At
that time I worked for a company that separate divisions, of which one was
a [consumer] retail outlet (interestingly, the other division was strictly
for Fedz contract work- oh, the irony!).  During 1987 ('88?) the Fedz (in the person of IRS) made rather a lot of
purchases via P.O., and was so "laid back" about [not] paying their bills,
that the retail side of the house put in a strict cash-only policy on
government purchases, and simultaneously placed a no-sale policy on them
until their bills were paid in full (which never happened, and which means
there were no further sales to the federales).

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

Wed Sep 19 16:23:31 2001
It's the U.S. foreign policy, stupid
Haroon Siddiqui
STAR COLUMNIST
AMERICA IS not the target of terrorism because Islamic
fundamentalists hate American democratic ideals of freedom, liberty and "all that we stand for,"  as George Bush has claimed. Only if it were so. The problem may be much bigger. This is what needs to be grasped, quickly, even in this period of
bereavement.  There is a danger in this television-driven drama's
misplaced focus on the ``how'' of last week's horror, that Americans
will not pay sufficient attention to the ``why'' of it. The worst possible interpretation of the evil deed is to assume that
it was carried out by spiritually inspired suicide bombers seeking
"martyrdom" as a reward for trying to topple American hedonism. The mad bombers did not fit the mould of pious avengers. On the eve
of their evil act, two were consuming vodka and ogling strippers at
a bar. Another who had come via Germany liked to drink and dance
with his live-in girlfriend whom he had ditched before crossing the
Atlantic. They were trying to "meld in," to avoid suspicion, say the experts
who know not that no true believer would ever behave so, even as a
ruse. Nor did the bombers come from impoverished hellholes, the breeding
grounds of zealots and ready recruits for extremist causes.
They were educated products of privilege, sons of affluent families
from Arab nations that are among America's strongest allies. This is
scarier than we think. What we think is based on what we are told. What we are being told
in the wake of the biggest terrorist act is what we have already
been told, ad nauseam, in the years before. None of it inspires much
confidence. Osama bin Laden is the prime suspect, yet we can't seem to get even
the most basic facts on him right.
He is said to have inherited $20 million. Or $200 million. Or $500
million. All stashed in a Sudanese bank. Or invested broadly. His accounts have remained frozen since 1998. Or maybe not. He has only a few dozen followers. Or a few hundred. Or "3,000 Arab
radicals from 12 countries." Or an army of "35,000 warriors"
assigned to secret cells around the globe. He lives in a cave with three rooms and four wives, satellite TV,
faxes and phones. Or he does not spend more than one night in any
Either out of ignorance or calculation, the theories on the motives
for last week's attacks avoid the most obvious: America has many
enemies. Not just because of globalization and a McWorld in which Coke brings
harmony to all. Or because of American cultural domination. Or
because America is arrogant and isolationist. Rather, it is due to American complicity in injustice, lethal and
measurable, on several fronts: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in which America stands by
decades-long Israeli defiance of United Nations resolutions,
international law and the most basic standards of human rights,
keeping millions penned in military-patrolled enclaves. The decade-long American-led economic sanctions on Iraq that have
killed 500,000 children under 5, strangled a whole nation and
destroyed the birthplace of civilization. The mess in Afghanistan where the CIA recruited and trained the
likes of bin Laden to overturn the Soviet occupation but dumped them
once that mission impossible was accomplished. Since then, the
American-led economic sanctions - imposed to help ferret out bin
Laden - have inflicted a new wave of misery, leaving thousands of
children dead and about 1 million people starving. American strategic alliances with the military and monarchical
dictatorships of Algeria, Turkey and Egypt, as well as the oil-rich
Arab states, all of whom crush even the smallest steps towards
democratization. Add the American sanctions on Iran, Sudan and Libya, "the rogue
states," plus the miseries of Bosnia, Chechnya and Kashmir, and you
begin to grasp the utter dismay, and sense of helplessness, gripping
the peoples of all these lands. Not all the conflicts can be blamed on America but many can be and
have been, especially in the last decade, only to draw indifference
or, more scandalously, a barrage of propaganda blaming the victims
themselves: that Muslim genes must account for all the savagery and
suffering surrounding them. It suits America to avoid the real issues, and the double standard
and hypocrisy enveloping them. It suits Israel to keep up the fundamentalist, terrorist mantra,
especially now, as it moves to create even more elbow room to crush
the intifadah. It suits Russia, which has cloaked its brutality in Chechnya as a
war against terrorism. It suits India on Kashmir. It suits China, in battling Uighur separatists in Xingiang region,
and in keeping America on side for joining the World Trade
Organization. With so many agendas at work, it is difficult to keep it all in
context. It goes without saying, but bears repeating, that no grievance can
ever justify what happened last week. But the apologists for America
and its allies are disingenuous in advancing the racist notion, with
nauseating regularity, that the victims burst out in anger because
their religion rewards them for it. Some no doubt believe so. But to
present them as the sole face of all the oppressed is to distort
reality. The public, more than the media, senses this. Some put it crudely: America had it coming. The surprise is how a broad spectrum of the
Canadian middle class, including academics, professionals and
business people, is coming to the view that America needs, beyond
any tactical strikes or smart bombs it might deploy, a more humane
and even-handed approach to the world. Haroon Siddiqui is The Star's editorial page editor emeritus. His e-mail address is hsiddiq at thestar.ca

January 07, 2002
Prosecutor: Police Acted Properly
CASSOPOLIS, Mich. (AP) - The FBI and Michigan State Police were
justified when they shot and killed two men at a campground known
for its advocacy of marijuana use, a prosecutor said in a report
released Monday.
The standoff at Rainbow Farm began Aug. 31 when Tom Crosslin, 46,
skipped a court date relating to drug and weapons charges and
allegedly set fire to buildings on his farm, which High Times
magazine once rated one of the nation's premier marijuana-smoking
Cass County Sheriff's deputies arrived and surrounded the farm,
and were joined later by the FBI and Michigan State Police.
Three days after the standoff began and negotiations had failed,
Crosslin left the farm's main house, armed with a rifle, to get
food and supplies from a neighbor's farm.
On his way back to his house, he spotted an agent in the woods and
raised his rifle, Cass County Prosecutor Scott Teter said. Two
agents fired at Crosslin, killing him.
Rolland Rohm, 28, who was Crosslin's business partner, remained in
the main house. The next morning, after Rohm had agreed to
surrender, the main house began burning, Teter said.
Thirty minutes later, Rohm ran out of the house carrying a rifle
and wearing black face paint. Teter said Rohm spotted a Michigan
National Guard light armored vehicle and pointed his rifle at two
Two Michigan State Police snipers nearby in the woods fired at
Rohm and killed him.
In both cases, Teter said, the shooters were protecting themselves
or others.
The Rohm and Crosslin families said through a spokesman Monday
that they rejected the findings.
"We think that Teter is playing fast and loose with the truth,"
spokesman Bill McMaster said. "There are two unexplained homicides
caused by 120 police with snipers, tanks and helicopters."

I don't know what your definition of military force is Marc, but any *group*
of persons who are armed and engaged in common cause qualify as a military
force in my book.
According to dictionary.com, "military" is defined as:
You may not approve of calling groups you disagree with "military", yet it
does not change the facts.
I assume you are referring to the WTC victims here.  Sorry, but they were not
"innocent".  They, as participants in the selection of the rulers of this
country, are 100% guilty of the many crimes perpetrated by the United States
against other peoples.
As for AQ being a "criminal association": how do you arrive at this?  I
suspect you get there by considering their acts to be outside of accepted
behaviour (of any "lawful" society).  If so, then I agree that they qualify
as a "criminal association", however, this definition also qualifies the USA
as a criminal association.
What's good for the goose should be good for the gander, ya?

Really? Fuhrer Bush disagrees with you.  Our Maximum Leader has "declared" a
"war on terrorism" (conveniently leaving out our own terrorist tendencies and
acts).  It was this "war" which led to the detention of these
prisoners.  Sorry Marc, these are indeed prisoners of war.  Or maybe you
consider that all the military force we just used over in Afghanistan was
something other than an act of war?  Terrorism maybe?

For those of  you not on a large number of listservs, here is a
dangerous new bill.
Steve Gotzler, National Lawyers Guild and November Coalition
PROPOSED LAW COULD SUBJECT YOU TO 20 YEARS IN PRISON
Stop the Senate From Banning Marijuana Rallies and Other Events
Take Action at: [Please direct any questions to bpiper at drugpolicy.org.]
The Senate is poised to pass legislation that would give federal
prosecutors new powers to shut down hemp festivals, marijuana rallies
and other events and punish business owners and activists for hosting
or promoting them. The proposed law would also potentially subject
people to enormous federal sentences if some of their guests smoked
marijuana at their party or barbecue. It would also effectively make
it a federal crime to rent property to medical marijuana patients and
their caregivers.
The bill, known as the Reducing American's Vulnerability to Ecstasy
Act (RAVE Act), was just introduced in the Senate on June 18th and has
already passed the Senate Judiciary Committee. It is moving VERY
rapidly and could be passed by the Senate as early as this week. While
it purports to be aimed at ecstasy and other club drugs, it gives the
federal government enormous power to fine and imprison supporters of
marijuana legalization, even if they've never smoked marijuana.
It is urgent that you take action today!
ACTIONS TO TAKE
**  Fax your Senators today. Go to     to find out more.
**  Forward this alert to your friends, family, and co-workers.
**  After you fax your Senators, please follow it up with phone calls.
    Tell them you just faxed them a letter in opposition to S. 2633,
    the Reducing American's Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act. Tell them
    that innocent business owners shouldn't be punished for the crimes
    of their customers. Tell them this bill has dangerous anti-civil
    liberties provisions that they need to be aware of, and this bill
    deserves serious debate.

MORE INFORMATION
The Senate is considering legislation that would give federal
prosecutors new powers to shut down raves, marijuana rallies and other
events they don't like and punish businessmen and women for hosting or
promoting them. The bill (S. 2633), also known as the Reducing
American's Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act (RAVE Act), is moving very
rapidly and could be considered by the full Senate as early as this
week. (A similar bill is also pending in the House.)
S. 2633, sponsored by Senators Durbin (D-IL), Hatch (R-UT), Grassley
(R-IA) and Leahy (D-VT), expands the so-called "crack house statute"
to allow the federal government to fine or imprison businessmen and
women if customers sell or use drugs on their premises or at their
events. Property owners, promoters, and event coordinators could be
fined hundreds of thousands of dollars or face up to twenty years in
federal prison if they hold raves or other events on their property.
If the bill becomes law, property owners may be too afraid to rent or
lease their property to groups holding hemp festivals or putting on
all-night dance parties, effectively stifling free speech and banning
raves and other musical events.
The new law would also make it a federal crime to temporarily use a
place for the purpose of using any illegal drug. Thus, anyone who used
drugs in their own home or threw an event (such as a party or
barbecue) in which one or more of their guests used drugs could
potentially face a $250,000 fine and years in federal prison. The bill
also effectively makes it a federal crime to rent property to medical
marijuana patients and their caregivers, giving the federal government
a new weapon in its war on AIDS and cancer patients who use marijuana
to relieve their suffering.
Health advocates worry that the bill will endanger our nation's youth.
If enacted, licensed and law-abiding business owners may stop hosting
raves or other events that federal authorities don't like, out of fear
of massive fines and prison sentences. Thus, the law would drive raves
and other musical events further underground and away from public
health and safety regulations. It would also discourage business
owners from enacting smart harm-reduction measures to protect their
customers. By insinuating that selling bottled water and offering
"cool off" rooms is proof that owners and promoters know drug use is
occurring at their events, this bill may make business owners too
afraid to implement such harm-reduction measures, and the safety of
our kids will suffer.
The RAVE Act punishes businessmen and women for the crimes of their
customers and is unprecedented in U.S. history. The federal government
can't even keep drugs out of prisons, yet it seeks to punish business
owners for failing to keep people from carrying drugs onto their
premises. If this bill passes, federal authorities will have the
ability to scare business owners away from using or renting their
property for marijuana festivals, as well as any other "politically
incorrect" event.
For more information on this bill, go to  and
under "bill number" search for S2633.

Why, after reading the questions presented below, think that Danit is
the *wrong* person to be writing this article?
Note that the term "community" here, while probably not accurate in
the strictest sense, is certainly a *LOT* more accurate than the
implied term "organization", which the vast majority of your questions
Cypherpunks are "organized" only in the sense that "they" manage to
get their shopping done when they run out of food.  There are CP's who
fall all over the 4 corners of the political spectrum, and all over
the physical world.  Realisticaly, about the only thing that they all
have in common is a strong interest in crypto, and a native suspicion
for most forms of "authority".
Now you've done it: expect 700 emails per day from MattD :-(
When did Humanity come into existence?  I'm serious here: CP merely
utilized a new communications medium.
Here we go with the "membership" thing again - You have it Completely
Wrong.  There are no "members", there is no "leadership", there is no
"Following" or "Group".  CP's are individuals who happen to identify
themselves as CP's - period.
The purpose?  You mean "What does The Group want to accomplish"?  See
Doctors, Lawyers, Mathematecians, Felons, Druggies, Anti-druggies,
Anarchists, Libertarians, Right-Wing-Fanatics, Left-Wing-Fanatics,
Teachers, Housewives, Househusbands, students, cops, criminals...
Agains, there IS NO GROUP.  I'm not trying to be cute here - THERE IS
NO GROUP.  The whole concept of "group" is flawed in this context.
Anyone's guess.  I personally know a bunch of folks who follow CP who
do so only out of curiosity: do I count them "in"? How about all the
federal agents who subscribe to the CP lists?  Getting the drift?
No.  There is no "Membership".
Varied.  Like the press itself.  Like the CP's themselves.  It is not
possible to place CP into any cubbyhole.
OooOoOooohhhhh....  "Internal Discussions"!  I like that: it implies
that (radical) Group thing again...  :-(
By some, and not others.
Sorry Kemosabe: most of the folks who refer to themselves as CP's are
less than "idealists".  And, since there IS NO F*@ GROUP, this
question is irrelevant.
Many: Google Is Your Friend.
"Official Statements"!  That's rich!!!  Tell you what - take one from
Column-A, and one from Column-B, where each column is the source of
your choice, and I'll [personally] acknowledge them as the Official
Statements of Whomever You Like.
I guess you should ask each CP individually.  Personally, my long term
plans are to Get Out Of Dodge (USA), before it turns into Germany in
1941.  My short term plans are to try and educate as many persons "in
authority" as possible in How The Real World Works, and as many
persons NOT "in authority" in How The Real World Works.
Maybe if someone were to form a CypherPunks GROUP, they would get

Nobody.  Any such "alliance" would require a Group Consensus -
something which is just patently impossible.  If you ever find two
CP's who can agree on enough to come to a broad Consensus, you let me
know so I can mark it on my calendar.
Now *there* are questions I can answer.

According to my LEO contacts, phreaking is not only on a fast rise, it

Of the Eight Critical Infrastructures identified by the USG, I

vulnerable to any societally significant "attack".  This is a
hilarious concept used to sell congresscritters and their military

Report: Iraq-al Qaeda link found
LONDON (AP) -- Documents discovered in the bombed out headquarters of Iraq's
intelligence service provide evidence of a direct link between Saddam
Hussein's regime and Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist network, a
newspaper reported Sunday. Papers found Saturday by journalists working for the Sunday Telegraph reveal
that an al Qaeda envoy met with officials in Baghdad in March 1998, the
newspaper reported. The paper quoted an unidentified Western intelligence official as saying the
find was "sensational." The paper said the documents show that the purpose of the meeting was to
establish a relationship between Baghdad and al Qaeda based on their mutual
hatred of the United States and Saudi Arabia. The meeting went so well that it was extended by a week and ended with
arrangements being discussed for bin Laden to visit Baghdad, the newspaper
said. Journalists found a three-page file on bin Laden inside a folder lying in the
rubble of one of the rooms of the intelligence headquarters, the paper said. "Iraqi agents at some point clumsily attempted to mask out all references to
bin Laden, using white correcting fluid," the newspaper reported. "After
carefully removing the dried fluid, however, the name is clearly legible
three times in the documents." One of the pages, dated February 19, was marked "top secret and urgent" and
referred to plans for the trip from Sudan of the unnamed envoy, who is
described in the file as a trusted confidant of bin Laden's, the paper said. The document, signed, "MDA," which the newspaper said is a code name believed
to belong to the director of one of the Iraqi intelligence sections, said the
Iraqis sought to pay for the envoy's costs while in Iraq "to gain the
knowledge of the message from bin Laden and to convey to his envoy an oral
message from us to bin Laden." The message to bin Laden "would relate to the future of our relationship with
him, bin Laden, and to achieve a direct meeting with him," the newspaper
quoted the document as saying. The other documents confirm that the envoy traveled from Khartoum in Sudan to
Baghdad in March 1998 and that he stayed at the al-Mansour Melia hotel. The documents do not mention whether any meeting took place between bin Laden
and Iraqi officials, the newspaper said. Separately, The Sunday Times reported that its own journalists had found
documents in the Iraqi foreign ministry that indicate that France gave Saddam
Hussein's regime regular reports on its dealings with American officials. The newspaper said the documents reveal that Paris shared with Baghdad the
contents of private transatlantic meetings and diplomatic traffic from
Washington. One document, dated September 25, 2001, from Iraqi foreign minister Naji
Sabri to Saddam's palace, was based on a briefing from the French ambassador
in Baghdad and covered talks between presidents Jacques Chirac and George
W. Bush.

obvious questions, for instance, if all WMD were destroyed before the war (as
Iraq stated), then (a) How is it that the US continually asserted that it
knew for FACT that these weapons existed, and even claimed to KNOW the exact
locations (but "wouldn't tell" Blix), and (b) if Iraq did in fact destroy all

Bug devices track officials at summit
By Audrey Hudson
THE WASHINGTON TIMES
    Officials who attended a world Internet and technology summit in
Switzerland last week were unknowingly bugged, said researchers who attended
the forum.     Badges assigned to attendees of the World Summit on the Information
Society were affixed with radio-frequency identification chips (RFIDs), said
Alberto Escudero-Pascual, Stephane Koch and George Danezis in a report issued
after the conference ended Friday in Geneva. The badges were handed out to
more than 50 prime ministers, presidents and other high-level officials from
174 countries, including the United States.     The trio's report said they were able to obtain the official badges with
fraudulent identification only to be stunned when they found RFID chips . a
contentious issue among privacy advocates in the United States and Europe
. embedded in the tags.     Researchers questioned summit officials about the use of the chips and
how long information would be stored but were not given answers.     The three-day WSIS forum focused on Internet governance and access,
security, intellectual-property rights and privacy. The United States and
other countries defeated an attempt to place the Internet under supervision
of the United Nations.     RFID chips track a person's movement in "real time." U.S. groups have
called for a voluntary moratorium on using the chips in consumer items until
the technology and its effects on privacy and civil liberties are addressed.     Mr. Escudero-Pascual is a researcher in computer security and privacy at
the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Miss Koch is the president of
Internet Society Geneva, and Mr. Danezis studies privacy-enhancing
technologies and computer security at Cambridge University.     "During the course of our investigation, we were able to register for the
summit and obtain an official pass by just showing a fake plastic identity
card and being photographed via a Web cam with no other document or
registration number required to obtain the pass," the researchers said.     The researchers chose names for the fake identification cards from a list
printed on the summit's Web site of attendees.     The hidden chips communicate information via radio frequency when close
to sensors that can be placed anywhere "from vending machines to the entrance
of a specific meeting room, allowing the remote identification and tracking
of participants, or groups of participants, attending the event," the report
said.     The photograph of the person and other personal details are not stored on
the chip but in a centralized database that monitors the
movement. Researchers said they are concerned that database will be used for
future events, including the next summit to be hosted by Tunisian
authorities.     "During the registration process, we requested information about the
future use of the picture and other information that was taken, and the
built-in functionalities of the seemingly innocent plastic badge. No public
information or privacy policy was available upon our demands that could
indicate the purpose, processing or retention periods for the data
collected. The registration personnel were obviously not properly informed
and trained," the report said.     The lack of security procedures violates the Swiss Federal Law on Data
Protection of June 1992, the European Union Data Protection Directive, and
United Nations' guidelines concerning computerized personal-data files
adopted by the General Assembly in 1990, the researchers said.     "The big problem is that system also fails to guarantee the promised high
levels of security while introducing the possibility of constant surveillance
of the representatives of civil society, many of whom are critical of certain
governments and regimes," the report said.     "Sharing this data with any third party would be putting civil-society
participants at risk, but this threat is made concrete in the context of WSIS
by considering the potential impact of sharing the data collected with the
Tunisian government in charge of organizing the event in 2005," it said.     The organization Reporters Without Borders was banned from attending the
summit and launched a pirate radio broadcast to protest the ban and detail
press-freedom violations by some countries attending the meetings, including
Tunisia.     "Our organization defends freedom of expression on the Internet on a
daily basis. Our voice should therefore be heard during this event, despite
this outrageous ban," said Robert Menard, secretary general of Reporters
Without Borders.     Tunisia is among several countries Reporters Without Borders has accused
of censoring the Internet, intercepting e-mails and jailing cyber-dissidents.

@_subject: A day in the life 
Well, summer is here, and I've just come off > two weeks without a day off,
so, I thought Itake this wonderful day, and use it like "normal" people
might. You know, a nice breakfast with my wife somewhere, maybe a little
casino time.  The standard speil.  But today turned out to be George Orwell
Day instead.
Submitted for your inevitable nodding of heads, and grumbling of "well, of
course!  What did you expect!" replies.
Breakfast was kind of cool actually - thanks for asking.  We trotted off to
the local Ameristar casino's Open Trough, er, "Buffet".  The food was
universally overcooked, sometimes to the point of knife-resistance, but the
great dessert bar more than made up for it.  And it's relatively
inexpensive.  Recommended for when lots of food at a low price is all you
care about.  Not recommended for impressing anyone with your gastronomic
knowledge ;-)
After breakfast however, we decided to spend some time, and likely the
~300.00 we had on us, at their casino.  Mind you, this may be the first time
I've been to *this* casino, but it's nowhere *near* my first time in *any*
casino.  This is far, far, FAR from the norms I'm used to.
Like good little state-sponsored-units, we stood in line for a few minutes,
waiting to show our ID and begin our excersize in negative economics.  When
our turn came, however, I presented my ID, and was met with a blank stare.
She looked at the ID.  She looked at me.  Back to the ID.
I'm getting ready for the SWAT team to make their entrance at this point.
"Sir, Where's your Amerstar Winners Card"?
"Don't you have a Winners Card?"
"I don't do loyalty cards. Thank you for thinking of me though."
"Sir, you can't get in without a Winners Card"
So much for a day at the casino.  Thank you Ameristar!  You saved me about
$300.00 today.
For those of you who are wondering, yes, you need detailed ID to get one of
their loyalty cards.  And while I wasn't able to get in to verify what I saw
standing in line, it looks like they track you table by table with these
So, being $300.00 richer, and having worked for over two weeks without a
break, *and* being 250 miles over my oil-change limit, I figured, aw, you
know what I figured!
Now, let me start off with some background here.  I've gone to the same
mechanic for almost 6 years now - for tires, oil, you name it.  The only
thing he doesn't get is the brakes, and then only cause my Subaru has some
kind of brakes-from-hell that even he says can't be serviced safely without
going to the dealer.  This mechanic, who runs the shop for the local Dobb's chain, is great.  Never
had a problem.  Never had to show ID either.  Doesn't care if Telecheck likes
me or not, he just takes the money, and gets my business.  And he gets a
*lot* of it.  His business is thriving, and he recently added 4 new bays to
his shop, and started taking Sundays off - hence, my problem.
So, we took the scenic route home, figuring there would have to be a
oilchange shop somewhere along the way.  And there were several.  The first
two were closed, but finally, we found a JiffyLube open and waiting.  With
two bays.  And no line (baaaaddd  sign on a wonderful day like this).  But I
*need* the damn oil change, so in we go.
"Good Afternoon Sir.  What can we help you with today?"
"Hi. Oil change please.  Synthetic blend please.  No extras, just an oil
"Sure, leave the keys in the car, and step over to the counter, and John will
be right with you".
When I got out of the car, the kid who was going to do the actual work wanted
to know if I had a loyalty card he could punch/swipe/whatever.  Nope.
"Well sir, just give me your name and address, and I'll get you a card".
"Thanks, but I don't want a card."
"They're absolutely free sir!"
"I know.  Thanks, but I don't want a card"
"I can't change your oil without a card"
"You're kidding.  Aren't you?"
"Sir, I need a card."
"John Smith.  123 Anywhere Street.  Anycity, Arkasas.  12345".
I almost died laughing when he asked.  I mean, where's Monty Python?  Behind
the storage shed?
"Thank you sir.  If you care to have a seat in the waiting room, we'll call
you when it's ready.
Into the waiting room we go.  With the little 8 inch TV mounted 12 feet in
the air, where nobody can actually see it, even though we have to listen to
it [at warp-volume].  There's some super overacted action-drama going on,
lot's of shooting, a car chase, and a guy jumping into an airplane which is
taking off - he jumped from a moving car to the plane - allin the ten minutes
we were waiting.  Thank god I threw out the television in '90.
Finally, a guy comes out from the shop.
"Sir, if you'll follow me, we can go over your car for a minute."
This is the upsell - I can just see it coming.  Wipers?  Air filter?
We walk over to a monitor sitting in this big red box made up to look like a
diagnostic center.  It's really just a sales terminal in a big red box,
sporting some pretty pictures of the products this guy is trying to talk you
into buying.
"Sir, would you like some engine cleaner?  You should have it once a year."
"No, I just want the oil change.  no wipers.  No engine cleaners.  Nothing
but an oil change"
"Sir.  I'm just doing my job - I have to ask you all these questions, since I
can't check you out and close out your ticket without asking."
Yes, he is an automaton.  He just can't take a blanket "no" and punch that
into each request, so we went down the whole list of radiator flushes,
transmission fluid checks and replacements, hoses, filters, etc.  Finally,
*thankfully*, we're done: he tells me I can go to the register to pay.
"Sir.  The total comes to $46.00".  As he says this, he notices that the
screen hasn't filled in my name, address, etc., from the swipe of the loyalty
"Sir, I need your last name."
"Your first name?"
"Whatever makes you happy.  Pick one."
He looks lost.  So lost.
"That's a nice name.  Use it."
"123 Anywhere St."
He dutifully types it in...
"Pick one."
We wait.  He looks at me waiting, looking even more lost and
confused.  Finally, I can take it no more, and I blurt out an answer, hoping
beyond hope that he'll "get it".
"New Caledonia."
"Sir, would you like a Jiffy Card for next time, so you won't have to wait
while we get this information?
Oh god...
So I have seen two separate businesses today who are just shooting themselves
in the head over the acquisition of data in the face of obvious
refusal.  While the Jiffy Lube is the more obscene example from a
bang-for-the-buck perspective, the casino was (for me) the real
shocker: casinos have, from day one, been very careful to protect
privacy.  You ever try to bring in a camera?  Forget it!  To have a casino
turn me away for lack of a loyalty card strikes me as, wel, preposterous!  I
cannot [literally] give you hundreds of dollars, asking nothing in return but
a chance to gaze longingly at the asses of the floor wait staff, without
divulging my entire pedigree?  Have we, as a society, completely lost all
touch with reality???
Those poor kids at the Jiffy Lube - obviously they *have* to get this data
for the corporate office, but they too exhibit an amazing amount of
programming here.  Not *one* of them had enough of a clear head to simply
fill in "refused", or "John Smith" on his own.  We have taken a real national
resource, our youth, and trained them to act as mindless droids, devoid of
even the minimum reasoning powers possessed by small insects, and I am,
inexplicably, astounded.
I am what anyone with an IQ of 12 or higher would call a hard core
cynic.  But even I am surprised.  Appalled even.  And oddly embarrassed to
find that things are not as bad as I constantly claim, but they are *worse* -
MUCH worse than that.  They are...  I don't *know* what they are - but
whatever it is, it is truly fucking evil...

Dear Senator:
I am very disturbed that the U.S. Senate is dragging its feet in
confirming pro-gun Alabama Attorney General William Pryor to the
11th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Make no mistake, General Pryor is more than qualified to assume a
position on the federal bench.  Not only does he have a "qualified"
rating from the American Bar Association, he has spent years
distinguishing himself as a top-class public servant.
He has served as the Editor in Chief of the Tulane Law Review.  He
has personally argued a case before the U.S. Supreme Court.  And he
has been elected to the position of Attorney General in the state
of Alabama.
Even partisan opponents have heaped high praise on him.  Dr. Joe
Reed, the chairman of the Alabama Democratic Conference, says that
William Pryor is a "first-class public official" who "will be a
credit to the judiciary and will be a guardian for justice."
I support General Pryor's nomination because he is pro-Constitution
and pro-Second Amendment.  And I will consider ANY vote to delay or
filibuster his nomination as an anti-gun vote.
I hope you will oppose any stall tactics and vote to CONFIRM William
Pryor to the federal bench.  Gun Owners of America will report to me
how you vote.  Thank you.

Ahhh, the joys of shopping for new toys.  A new sling.  A scope mount and
4x.  Music to the ears (after mufflers are properly applied :-).
Here in the heart of Redneck Country, there are two stores with a decent
selection that are under an hours drive: Dunn's and Galyans (a chain).  Galyans is closer, so off I went.
I made several purchases, including three different scope mounts, as I was
uncertain as to the proper form in use - figuring that bringing back the two
wrong choices would not be a big deal.  I even checked at the counter -
"Sure.  No problem.  Just bring your receipt.".
Well, when I brought back the returns, they wanted a drivers license.  Odd,
considering it was a cash sale and I was holding the receipt.
"It's required by the Homeland Security Department" says the kid behind the
register.  Sorry.  I need ID, and I have to enter it into the computer and
forward it to the Homeland Security Office.  The Terrorists are using this
kind of thing to wash money."
I must have looked pretty stupid with my jaw hanging down like that.
I made a scene of course.  A *big* scene.  Lots of loud argument, pointing
out all the obvious things: as a cash sale, the money did not need
"washing".  Cash sales are inherently ID agnostic.  Etc., etc., etc.
No dice.
They want ID, and they are not going to budge.
I guess Galyans is off my list of acceptable stores :-(   Pity, as I've spent
almost a grand there since they opened just a few months ago, and had plans
to sped a *lot* more.  Next time, I'll have to make that extra 25 minute
drive to Dunn's and pray they have what I want.
I suppose I shouldn't be surprised - we all *knew* this day was coming - but
I really thought it wouldn't happen until RFIDs were in the money...

Obviously, every ISP does.
Maybe I should have been clearer: the feds didn't show us at any of the small
guys (AFAIK), such as the regional or small nationals - they showed up at the
large multinationals (of which the one I work at was likely the smallest,
with a mere 48 countries of footprint).  They clearly understood that
sniffing my peering/transit pipes wasn't technically *possible* (yet) - what
they were interested in was sniffing my regional POPs, with [relatively] low
speed OC3/OC12 pipes.  To rephrase it: they were interested in *my*
customers, not the traffic from other companies (they had other field
officers at the other NSPs).
It's a lot more likely than you seem to realize.  The internet is a
collection of aggregation points (ISPs): get the individual aggregations, and
the rest is as visible as a reconstructed RAID5 stripe.
This type of thing certainly goes on, but not in the vaccum cleaner world of
large pipes.  This is only technically feasible for targetted investigations.
The loops are too far out on the edge to be useful for anyone but the loop
owner themselves, and there are *way* too many [ever changing] paths out of
any individual ASN - the aggregation point is where this kind of action
*must* happen.
As I noted: much to my amazement, many do exist.

Man shipped from New York to Texas in crate
Tuesday, September 9, 2003 Posted: 10:31 PM EDT (0231 GMT)
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal officials are investigating how a man managed to
hide inside a crate that was flown by a major cargo carrier from New York to
Dallas, Texas. Charles McKinley wanted to go to his father's house in Dallas and decided to
"ship himself rather than pay for a ticket," said Transportation Security
Administration spokeswoman Suzanne Luber. McKinley secured himself in the crate, apparently with some help, along with
his computer and some clothes. The incident highlighted a potential hole in aviation security. Luber shipped himself through cargo carrier Kitty Hawk Inc., which said it
was told by the shipping firm, Pilot Air Freight, that the crate was loaded
with computer monitors. The crate, marked as containing computer equipment, was picked up at a
company called Metrotech in the Bronx, New York, and driven to John
F. Kennedy International Airport, and then to Newark, New Jersey, where it
was placed on a Kitty Hawk cargo plane, she said. "The plane actually went to Buffalo. From Buffalo it went to Fort Wayne,
Indiana. There was a change of planes onto another Kitty Hawk cargo plane,
and he ended up at DFW [Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]," Luber
said. He was then driven to the intended address, which was his father's house in
De Soto, a suburb 14 miles south of Dallas. Carl Smith, assistant chief of the De Soto Police Department, said that when
the deliveryman went to remove the box from the truck he noticed a person
inside. Authorities believe Smith had moved something he had been using to cover
himself, so the driver was able to see him through a slit in the crate. "At that time, the young man kicked one side of the crate out, crawled out,
got his box, and walked around to the back of the house," Smith said. The driver contacted police. McKinley is being held at the Dallas County Sheriff's Department, Smith
said. Authorities have not released his age, but news reports said he is 25. Luber said authorities detained McKinley on outstanding warrants for theft of
a check and a traffic violation. The TSA is working with the FBI and the
U.S. attorney's office to investigate and determine if there are any federal
charges for this incident. "We've made significant improvements in cargo security, but we do have more,
more to go," Luber said. TSA teams have examined cargo carriers and the
airport facilities they use to load packages "to determine strengths and
weaknesses in cargo security," she said. The TSA has a cargo security advisory committee that is expected to provide
recommendations for additional security as early as October 1, she said. "The bottom line is just like passenger security there's not just one single
silver bullet," Luber said. "We're taking a layered approach. "Should Congress ask us, we are ready to train cargo pilots as federal flight
deck officers." Federal flight deck officers are armed with guns in the
cockpit. Richard Phillips, chairman and chief executive officer of Pilot Air Freight,
said his company rigidly adhered to TSA procedures, keeping the crate off a
passenger plane and placing no travelers at risk. "It is unfortunate that one individual would choose to flaunt air
regulations," he said. A spokesman for Kitty Hawk Cargo added, "This is a very unusual incident." CNN correspondent Patti Davis contributed to this report.

um, less than what the public thinks they are.  A LOT less, at least
technically.  Nevertheless, the guys (and gals) they hire are generally a
good cross-section of smart and educated middle classers, who are quite
capable of learning what they need to know.  I would guess that the

As I understand it, they're simply having similar agencies from other

countries willing to do so.
There has been a lot of change in this area over the last two years.
The feebs are in a position right now where it's not a matter of "swallowing
their pride", but rather a "corporate mandate" if you will: they have been
*ordered* to make these types of extraditions happen.  Of course, the next [obvious] question is where did I get this
information?  From work: we had an incident that resulted in an FBI call and
international players from third world countries.
If it's just Mattd they're looking for, then I too doubt that he's worth

I had a very interesting conversation today with a pair of cops who work
under the PA - a real mindblower.
While the ALA, ACLU, and everyone else I can think of is screaming for the PA
to be withdrawn, preferably *now*, I found it interesting that the cops had
pretty much the same opinion, although for different reasons.
LEAs, according to these guys, were able to get a *lot* more information,
with a lot less hassle, *prior* to the PA.  The reasoning went something like
this: Before the PA, they could grab a routine subpoena, "practically
preprinted, from damn near any prosecutor [they] could find", serve it on a
library/bank/, and get anything they
wanted.  Now, they have to get an "investigative subpoena" (I believe I
remember this term correctly, but if not, anyone with more accurate info
please correct me), and have this subpoena signed off on by both a federal
persecutor *and* a federal judge in the correct district, and then serve on
the appropriate party: and this new "investigative subpoena" can request far
less data than the old ones, as they have to be strictly PA-compliant.
Needless to say, the thought that LEOs find the the PA to be "way to
restrictive compared to before" struck me as one of the most bizzarre things
I'd ever heard.  But they were quite adamant that given a choice, they would
gladly go back to the "old way".
The only thing that could possibly, IMHO, make this more understandable, was
that the two LEAs I was speaking to were not themselves fedz.  I find it exquisitely amusing that I and my neighbor LEOs share the common
goal of seeing the PA rot in hell :-)

(1) Citicorp Center.
    Thousands of people work in this one gargantuan and
profoundly ugly building.  As a bonus, it belongs to one of Israel's
biggest finance sources ;-)
(2) One Police Plaza.
    Not just for donuts anymore!  This huge, purpose-built, multibuilding
plaza houses a significant percentage of New York's police department.  As
a bonus, it is also a centralized facility which serves a large number of
federal and state agencies as well.  One Stop Shopping!!!
(3) The George & Martha Washington Bridges.
    These two bridges share a single two level span which connects New
York and New Jersey (the Martha bridge was an add-on to the George, when
George turned out to be too small to carry all the traffic).  Destruction
of these two incredibly ugly and poorly designed bridges would be a boon
for the esthetic flavor of the area (which is otherwise surrounded by some
of the most beautiful areas in New York City proper), not to mention the
air quality.  And, for AQ, the resulting economic damages would amount ot

Old news.  The ability to update CPU microcode has been around (publicly)
since the Pentium Pro.  I have no proof (other than vague memories), but I
believe this was around even earlier on some of the more archaic CPU lines
in the middle 80's.

Thats an interesting question on several different levels:
(1) There is (both within LEAs and the rest of us) a wide range of
opinions as to the feasability of stego being used in the field for
anything useful.  Remember that USA "professional spies" (who spent over a
year learning tradcraft IIRC) had continuous problems with very simple
encryptions/decryptions in the real world.
(2) The folks in the "Al Qaeda is Satan" camp generally believe that not
only is stego in wide use, but that AlQ has somehow managed to turn it
into a high bandwidth channel which is being used every day to Subvert The
American Way Of Life and infect Our Precious Bodily Fluids.  No amount of
education seems to dissuade these people from their misbeliefs.
(3) The other camp believes that stego is a lab-only toy, unsuitable for
much of anything besides scaring the shit out of the people in the Satan
(4) I have yet to meet a full dozen people who share my belief that while
stego *may* be in use, if it is, that use is for one way messages of
semaphore-class messages only.  I really do not understand why this view
is poopoo'd by all sides, so I must be pretty dense?

Assuming you are willing to use your semaphores over overt channels.
Rudimentary stego is useful when you want those same low-bandwidth
messages delivered covertly.
Yet at the same time, stego is such a low bandwidth medium as to argue
strongly against it's use for truly complex messaging systems.
We're not necessarily talking about an IP transport for these messages.
My belief is that any unicast IP transport is inherently dangerous for
critical *must-be-truly-anonymous* messaging.  To put it another way, I
would not (if I was AlQ, which I'm not.  At least not this week...) use
the internet for critical messaging.  Just like I wouldn't use a satellite

Truth be told, lies are part of Pentagon strategy
By JOSEPH L. GALLOWAY
Knight Ridder Newspapers
WASHINGTON - "The first casualty when war comes is truth." So said Sen.
Hiram Johnson, a California Republican, in the year 1917.
There is a struggle inside the Pentagon over where to draw the line in
conducting so-called information operations or propaganda in the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq and who will be involved. On one side are the
information warfare activists, led by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld
and Assistant Secretary Douglas Feith. On the other are those who believe
that telling lies to the media is wrong and military public affairs
officers should never be involved in that.
The wrangling has been going on since soon after the 9/11 attacks in 2001
when a Pentagon war planner, speaking anonymously, told a Washington Post
reporter, "This is the most information-intensive war you can imagine.
We're going to lie about things."
Not long afterward the Pentagon opened its controversial Office of
Strategic Influence amid reports that its mission included planting false
news stories in the international media. A public outcry led to the hasty
shuttering of that office, but Rumsfeld served notice that while the
office may have been closed, its mission would be continued by other
The defense secretary told reporters on Nov. 18, 2002: "Fine, you want to
savage this thing, fine. I'll give you the corpse. There's the name. You
can have the name, but I'm going to keep doing every single thing that
needs to be done, and I have."
This week the Los Angeles Times reported that CNN had been targeted in an
information war operation three weeks before the start of the attack
against Fallujah. On Oct. 14 Marine 1st Lt. Lyle Gilbert, a public affairs
spokesman, went on camera to declare that "troops crossed the line of
departure" - that the Fallujah operation was under way.
It was not. The U.S. commanders obviously hoped that the false news
broadcast by CNN would trigger certain moves by the insurgents and foreign
terrorists holding the Sunni city - moves that then could be analyzed to
gain information on how they would defend Fallujah.
Marine sources in Iraq flatly deny that Lt. Gilbert's statement to CNN was
a deception operation or part of a larger psy-war operation. They say the
distinction between public affairs and information operations is very
clear and jealously guarded by the public affairs community.
Also this week the Washington Post brought new attention on the
friendly-fire killing of Army Ranger Pat Tillman, a former NFL football
star who gave up the spotlight to become a soldier. For days after the
death of Tillman, military commanders and spokesmen both in Afghanistan
and at Fort Bragg left out any mention of his having been killed by
American bullets as they spun the story of a hero killed in battle.
That incident brought to mind the false stories about the rescue and
heroism of Pvt. Jessica Lynch foisted on reporters during the opening days
of the attack into Iraq. The official picture painted initially was of a
young woman who fought to the last bullet before being wounded and
captured. The truth was that Pvt. Lynch was injured when the vehicle in
which she was riding crashed and she was knocked unconscious. She never
fired a shot.
An investigation of the Tillman death and the information given to the
media is presently under way, according to an Army spokesman. Defense
Department spokesman Larry DiRita says he has asked his staff for "more
information" on how the Oct. 14 Marine incident came to pass.
Critics point to one troubling recent development: the decision by
commanders in Iraq in mid-September to combine information operations,
psychological operations and public affairs into a single strategic
communications office run by an Air Force brigadier general who reports
directly to Gen. George Casey, the American commander.
Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote a
letter in late September warning American commanders of the problems of
lumping military public affairs in with information operations.
Myers warned that public affairs and information operations must remain
separate. But his warning seems to have fallen on deaf ears in Iraq
because civilian leaders in the Pentagon and the National Security Council
insisted on a blended effort of both public affairs and psy-ops to woo
Iraqi and Arab support for America's efforts in Iraq.
In the old days of the Cold War America's propaganda war was fought by the
U.S. Information Agency, which was strictly forbidden from distributing
any propaganda inside the United States. USIA was first gutted and then
folded into the State Department during the mid-1990s.
Everyone involved in this argument would do well to heed Gen. Myers'
warning against mixing the liars and the truth-tellers in one pot. That
distinction was blurred during the Vietnam War and the image the American
public carried away was of the Five O'Clock Follies, the daily official
news briefing in Saigon where lies and spin were dispensed along with the
Believe me, we do not want to go there again.

Sept. 11 Conspiracy Theorist Offers $100,000 Prize
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jimmy Walter has spent more than $3 million
promoting a conspiracy theory the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United
States were "an inside job" and he is offering more cash to anyone who
proves him wrong.
The millionaire activist is so convinced of a government cover-up he is
offering a $100,000 reward to any engineering student who can prove the
World Trade Center buildings crashed the way the government says.
"Of course, we expect no winners," Walter, 57, heir to an $11 million
fortune from his father's home building business, said in a telephone
interview from California on Wednesday.
He said a panel of expert engineers would judge submissions from the
Next month, he also launches a nationwide contest seeking alternative
theories from college and high school students about why New York's
World Trade Center collapsed. The contest offers $10,000 to the best
alternative theory, with 100 runner-up awards of $1,000. Winners will be
chosen next June.
The World Trade Center's twin towers were destroyed after hijackers
slammed two commercial airliners into them. The attack in New York
killed 2,749 people.
Various official investigations give no credence to Walter's theory. A
Sept. 11 commission spokesman did not return calls seeking comment.
Walter insists there had to be explosives planted in the twin towers to
cause them to fall as they did, and also rejects the official
explanation for the damage done at the Pentagon.
"We have all the proof," said Walter, citing videotapes and testimony
from witnesses.
"It wasn't 19 screw-ups from Saudi Arabia who couldn't pass flight
school who defeated the United States with a set of box cutters," he
said. He dismissed the official Sept. 11 commission report, saying, "I
don't trust any of these 'facts."'
Walter has spent millions of dollars to bolster support for his case,
running full-page ads in The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal,
The New Yorker and Newsweek, as well as alternative newspapers and
30-second TV spots.
He points to a Zogby poll he commissioned last summer that showed 66
percent of New Yorkers wanted the 9/11 investigation reopened.
Walter has spent about 30 percent of his net worth on his efforts.
"I am a patriot fighting the real traitors who are destroying our
democracy. I resent it when they call me delusional," he said.

You keep asserting this, but at the same time fail to provide an example.
Please show how flying "can easily be a requirement, not an option".  One
legitimate example will suffice.
No - that's the entire point here.
So, your position is that we should not take action now, because we may
have to take the same action later?
If people would assert their economic powers today through refusal to fund
the airlines, the same threat would prevent your example from being
possible in the future.  The only reason your "walking" scenario is even a
little plausible is because TheMan/G'mint/etc., knows that there will be
no pushback on *any* front.
Also, not that while airlines are heavily regulated, they are not
(theoretically at least) publicly funded, and as such, your "right" to use
them is limited - whereas roads are public property, and will be a lot
harder to place prohibitions upon.  A real boycott of airlines would take
only days to bring both the airlines and the TSA to it's knees - the
economic impact would be both national in scope and immediate in effect:
you can make no legitimate argument for not addressing the TSA problem
head on.

In Defense of the Petition Clause:
Battles Now Underway on Three Fronts
2nd Circuit Directs DOJ to Explain
Lack of IRS Summons Enforcement Authority
As is now widely known, since July of 1999 the We The People organization
has led a nationwide legal and educational attack on the federal
government, utilizing the force of .popular constitutionalism.. This
assault has come in the form of an intelligent and rational exercise of
the First Amendment Right to Petition for Redress of Grievances, relating
to the government.s imposition of an unconstitutional, direct,
un-apportioned tax on labor.
What is also known is that in November of 2002, three additional Petitions
for Redress were added to the People.s overall Petition process. These
Petitions are related to the Constitution.s war powers clauses versus the
Iraq Resolution, the privacy and due process clauses versus the USA
Patriot Act, and the money and debt limiting clauses versus the Federal
Reserve System.
It is also widely known that the People.s Petitions for Redress have been
legally served on the highest ranking officials of the Executive and
Legislative branches of the federal government, including the President
and leadership of the Congress and every member of Congress, the Attorney
General, Treasury Secretary, and Commissioner of the IRS. Undoubtedly,
these officials know about the We The People Foundation and the Petitions
for Redress of Grievances.
What.s more, with dismay, the People watched their servant government.s
reaction: they have seen the government trespass on the People.s First
Amendment Right to Petition by striking out against the Petitioners --
infringing on that unalienable Right, rather than respond by answering
their questions.
The People decided to fight back . to defend against this invasion of
their Right to Petition. Nearly two thousand joined the fight this year by
becoming named plaintiffs in the lawsuit aimed at getting the federal
courts to declare the meaning of the Right to Petition, including the
Right of the People to retain their money until their grievances are
redressed if the government decides not to properly and honestly respond
as the Constitution commands.
What has not been widely known is that parallel battles in defense against
the government.s invasion of the People.s Right to Petition are now being
fought on a total of three judicial fronts by the We The People
organization. What follows is an update of the primary lawsuit and
breaking news regarding significant developments in a related case that
has reached the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals. This second case was brought
by Chairman Bob Schulz, as the sole plaintiff, against the IRS.  We will
discuss the third case in a future article.

On July 19, 2004, this case was initiated in the U.S. District Court in
the District of Columbia. An Amended Complaint was filed in early
On September 30, 2004, as we had previously reported, the government filed
a Motion to Dismiss our complaint.
On November 12, 2004, Mark Lane and Bob Schulz filed a Memorandum in
Opposition to the government.s motion to dismiss.
We asked constitutional scholar and attorney John Wolfgram to review and
comment on our Opposition memorandum. Wolfgram called the Memorandum
.Splendid.Brilliant.. Click here for Wolfgram.s comments.
Wofgram is the author of the article, .How the Judiciary Stole the Right
To Petition,. which was published in 31 U. WEST L.A. L. REV. (Summer
Wolfgram has a B.A. Degree (University of Wisconsin) and a J.D. Degree
(Southwestern University 1977). Wolfgram founded the Constitutional
Defender Association in 1989 to advance Petition Clause Principles.
Its name derives from the observation that the practical value of a
Constitution depends on the effective enforcement of constitutional rights
and limits against government, by the people. Wolfgram argues that the
Petition Clause is the People's Right to redress government violations of
the Constitution - the Constitution's Defense system against government
usurpation and oppression.
According to the rules of the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia, the government had until November 17, 2004 to reply to our
Memorandum in Opposition to the government.s Motion to Dismiss. However,
DOJ filed a Motion for more time, due in part, to .the gravity of the
relief sought..
We thought this to be an odd reason because the only relief we are seeking
is a declaration of our Rights under the Petition Clause of the First
Amendment, and an end to unconstitutional retaliation against those who
Petition for Redress. However, the court granted the request. DOJ's reply
is due today, December 22, 2004.
After reading the government.s motion to dismiss our complaint, our
Memorandum in Opposition (dated 11/12/04), and the government.s reply (due
12/22/04), the court will decide to deny or grant the government.s motion
to dismiss. If the court denies the government.s motion to dismiss, the
government may appeal that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals. If the
government does not appeal the court.s denial of its motion to dismiss,
the case will move to the discovery phase, in advance of trial. On the
other hand, if the court grants the government.s motion to dismiss, we
will appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals.
On November 12, 2004, Mark Lane and Bob Schulz filed a Motion to Amend our
complaint, in order to add hundreds of named plaintiffs, to narrow the
issues and to cure a minor issue in our complaint.  The government has
opposed our Motion to Amend the complaint and we have replied to the
government.s opposition. We are also awaiting the court.s decision on our
Motion to Amend. Right-Click to download the Second Amended Complaint.
A Second Front:  Schulz v. IRS
A second front has been established in the People.s defense against the
government.s invasion of our First Amendment Right to Petition. Bob Schulz
has sued the IRS for interfering with his Right to Petition for Redress.
The government decided to retaliate against the leaders of the Petition
process, including Bob Schulz in his personal capacity and as Chairman of
the WTP organization. The government served Schulz with a Summons,
demanding that Schulz turn over certain personal records to the IRS.
Schulz immediately sued the IRS in the US District court. In his
complaint, Schulz asked the Court to quash the IRS Summons on the grounds
that the IRS did not have a legitimate purpose, that the IRS was
infringing on his First Amendment Right to Petition and his Right to
associate with others of like mind, and that the Summons was nothing more
than harassment and impermissible retaliation.
Right-click here for the Memorandum of Law.
The IRS, as defendant, did not respond to the lawsuit. They never made an
appearance in District Court! Eventually, Schulz motioned the District
Court for a default judgment. The District Court issued its decision,
holding that the court was prevented by law from quashing an IRS Summons.
Schulz immediately appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit (see Schulz.s Appellant Brief). The IRS, through its attorney, the
U.S. Department of Justice, decided to make an appearance in the court of
Appeals. DOJ, through its Senior Counsel, Robert Storch, filed a
Respondent.s Brief. Schulz filed his Reply Brief.
Oral argument was held last week on December 13, 2004.
At oral argument, DOJ argued that the District Court lacked jurisdiction
and could not quash the Summons served on Schulz because the Summons
legally meant nothing. Ironically, in order to scuttle Schulz.s case by
asserting lack of jurisdiction, and to avoid a judicial skirmish directly
debating the Summons authority of the IRS, DOJ argued before the three
appellate justices that the IRS Summons was legally .unenforceable,.
therefore Schulz was under no legal obligation to respond to it, denying
the court subject matter jurisdiction.
Schulz disagreed. He argued that Reisman was dispositive, that in Reisman,
the US Supreme Court recognized the jurisdiction of the federal courts in
such matters, by declaring the right of a person served with an IRS
Summons to respond to the Summons by taking the IRS to a US District
Court.  Schulz also argued that under Powell, the IRS was required to
appear in court to prove its purpose in issuing the Summons was a
legitimate purpose. Finally, Schulz argued that the court had jurisdiction
on the ground that the Summons was, in fact, an IRS .enforcement action.
with significant adverse, statutorily prescribed consequences (including
arrest for contempt), if he either ignored the Summons or failed to give
the IRS what it was demanding of Schulz. See IRC Sections 7604 & 7210.
During argument, one of the justices inquired of Storch, .If there is no
legal obligation to respond to IRS Summons, then why didn't the IRS simply
print a disclaimer on the Summons itself informing people that they did
not have to respond to the Summons?. Storch could not answer the question.
In a highly unusual move, the appellate court ordered DOJ to submit a
memorandum to the Court by December 23, 2004, further explaining to the
court why DOJ believes people do not have to respond to IRS Summons, why
people will suffer no consequences if they ignore such Summons, and why
the court is without power to grant Schulz.s request to quash the Summons.
In response, Storch, the Senior Counsel in the office of the US Attorney,
repeatedly asserted he did not understand this area of the law and would
have to engage IRS officials to draft the Memorandum requested by the

The Third Front
A third battle in defense against the government.s attempt to seize power
from the People by acting without authority, and in defense of the
People.s Right to Petition is now being waged. This battle also involves
the practical application and legal enforcement of the Right to Petition
by withholding taxes.
Specifically, the case involves property taxes and the commitment of seven
families who have "bet the farm" in defense of their constitutionally
protected Rights.  We will provide details in a future article.
Just The Beginning
Although we have made considerable progress since our primary judicial
work commenced just months ago, and it appears the government is having
measured difficulty with our efforts thus far, we want to remind everyone
that our battle to secure the Right to Petition -- and restore
Constitutional Order -- will likely be long, and without doubt, very
Although many are fighting hard and sacrifices have been made, there
remains much to be done -- including moving the District Court for
Injunctive protections for all the lawsuit Plaintiffs, generating a
critical mass of public awareness, and defending our Rights through trial
Court, the Courts of Appeal, and through to the Supreme Court.
We ask each of you to help us remain focused on our common objectives and
strategies and share, as you are able, in the substantial burdens of this
landmark, righteous, and necessary cause.
Please consider a year-end, tax-deductible donation so that you and your
family may soon enjoy Freedom as our Founders and our Creator intended.
PLEASE REMEMBER DICK SIMKANIN
After four requests for more time, Simkanin's attorney is apparently about
ready to file his Brief on Behalf of Appellant Simkanin. One would argue
that it is better to take the time to prepare a persuasive and winning
argument than to rush the appeal brief and fall short.
Although it shocks the senses to consider what Dick Simkanin and his wife
Carol have endured in defense of Liberty, Dick's sprit remains very strong
and positive.  He has asked us to remind people not to forget him and that
he always looks forward to "mail call". Please consider dropping Dick a

I do not have the detailed technical details I would have liked - I did
ask some of these types of questions and received little more
than careful "decline to answer"s.
What I do know is that this type of monitoring is being done on a regular,
although limited scale, in FISA proceedings.  The targets are generally
CRT emissions, and the distance between target and acquisition gear is
under .5 miles - still a shocking range which I was totally unprepared
for.  I engaged one of the operators in a discussion about the tempest
resistant typefaces, and he was unaware of them.  Food for thought...
Interestingly, I have had more than one report of aural acquistion of
typists keystrokes being used to attempt to calculate the content of a

After waiting around for about 45 minutes, the motorcade passed by us
again. A few police cars, followed by a van or two, drove by. Then, a
Bush/Cheney bus passed, followed by a second one going slower. At the
front of this second bus was The W himself, waving cheerily at his
supporters on the other side of the highway. Adam, Brendan, and I rose our
banner (the More Trees, Less Bush one) and he turned to wave to our side
of the road. His smile faded, and he raised his left arm in our direction.
And then, George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States of
America, extended his middle finger.
Read that last sentence again.
I got flipped off by George W. Bush.
A ponytailed man standing next to us confirmed the event, saying, "I do
believe the President of the U.S. just gave you boys the finger." We
laughed probably for the next half hour, and promptly told everyone we

and the tint of the bus windows make it difficult to see him at all.
Nonetheless, it was the best possible reaction.

Speaking as someone who qualifies: no.  However, the fact that you even
asked the question begs another question, namely, what do you consider
"major"?  Savvis was, in my opinion, at the very lower end of "major",
operating in ~140 countries, although most of that was vpn and multicast.
Lets guess that internet was considerably less, say ~15-20 countries

OK, so Tyler [apparently] works in the business :-)
Let me fill in what he left out.  Yes, the industry is moving towards
MPLS over POS.  That's not where it is now though.  At least not for most
interfaces.  Right now the industry is chock full of lagacy gear, mostly
old fashioned ATM.  You think you can just casually reassemble this crap
in transit?  Let's see it!
Besides that old fashioned transport diversity, we have the original
problem: even if you could do it (maybe in three to five years), what are
you going to do with the data you've snarfed?  Backhaul it?  Shove it into
TB cassettes?  Better keep a guy on staff to change the tray!!
None of the many obstacles curretly in the way will allow this to be done
on the QT.  Semi-openly would be another story, as would the scenario of a
smaller, say regional, ISP.

Note that this is totally not the scenario we had under discussion (i.e.,
the intercepts being done at the ISP level).
If you were to ask me if Mr. Fed. was currently capable of (a)
intercepting offshore, say 3-4mi off the formal landings, (b) splice into
transatlantic fibers and send the copy down their own fibers, all of it
underwater, well, that would be a different discussion entirely.  One
we seriously discussed just after a pair of buildings became a pair of
dust factories.
I *firmly* believe this is possible, if not probable, at least on a large
scale (although probably not on a complete scale).  When the towers came
down and the feds were asking everyone to volunteer to host carnivores, we
all thought they gave up *way* too easily when turned away (at least the
were turned away where I worked - my understanding is that this was not
universal).  Subsequently, we discussed, mostly as an academic excersize,
whether we believed this was possible - and the consensus was a resounding

I (and I suspect you) live in the "high tech" world, so we have a pretty
good grasp of the current state of the art.  As a rule, Joe Sixpack thinks
that the g'mint is a couple of trillion years ahead of Moore's Law ("Shure
they can break all that there commie crypto ssl hidden horsesheet!"),
while a large part of academia tends to believe that the USG is around ten
years *behind* them (oh, to have such an ego!).  In my personal
experience, they tend to have roughly a five year lead on what my
world considers "bleeding edge".  That said, I'm willing to cut them a few
more years of slack when doing the necessary threat assessment, but I just
do not believe they are 20, or even 10 years ahead.  And that is not an
"idle" belief, it's a considered, long formed opinion, based on an awful
lot of input data.
Conservatism in the real world, unreasonable paranoia in the academic
world (a necessary thing in that context).  These are the right move.  But
in real-world assessment, if you use the academic paranoia model, you will
never be able to engineer an appropriate solution (i.e., one that
successfully balances current and expected lifetime threats, along with
project expense and elegance of implementation.
I truly think we are all addressing the very same thing - we are just
approaching it from slightly different perspectives.  I see these as
"real" engineering problems, while you are looking at them as pure
academic excersizes.  We will obviously be reaching different endpoints
this way, since we are assuming a different input set :-)
Ahhh, but they are!  That's why they went to COTS in the first place (they
were forced).  The scale of that cost binding may be difficult to
ascertain since their outer cost limit is just astronomical (unless you
are Shrub, who thinks he can just print more money when he runs out), but
it does exist.
This is actually a *very* good point.  It would also address the off-shore
splice vs power issue nicely.  But we are still constrained by backhaul.
In answer to the earlier question of how much dark fiber is there: roughly
12% of the fiber now in the ground is lit.  Yes, there is a shitload of
capacity sitting unused.  Unfortunately, the people who buried all that
glass were all competing in pretty much the same basic areas, so what we
ended up with was orders of magnitude too much capacity around several
large hub cities, while there is a critical shortage in other places.
Yes, VA and DC have gluts of glass.  In fact, that is one of the most
concentrated glut areas.
While this cannot be discounted in toto, the tech comes to them from
academia (most of the time), so generally, if you are widely read, you'll
have a pretty good idea of what's *possible*.  You are likely dead-on
accurate about the fabs though.
Yup.  The Irony Meter is hanging out at the right of the scale again :-)
Undersea taps are hard.  No matter how you figure it.  Pressurized cables
with PSI monitors and microsecond resolution monitoring is not something
you can break into and splice without a great deal of care.  For the
record, yes, I believe it can be, and is being done.  I would be surprised
if it was on a large scale though - even with "nukular poweer".
Or not, depending on geographic location.
Always.  And *this* is the lesson most often forgotten.

Strong, yes, but it does not react the same way.  I have had an
opportunity to acquire body armor and receive "formal instruction" in
proper use, yada yada, and it was repeated over and over again that in
order to provide a reliable barrier to high speed projectiles, it had to
be kept *dry*.  The instructor went as far as making the "half joking"
recommendation that approaches to persons with obvious liquids (coffe
cups, soda cans, etc.)  should be considered potentially lethal.  We were
repeatedly warned that searches and questionings of persons "armed with
fluids" should be delayed until such time as the potential lubricants were
properly neutralized.
The lubricant effect is what makes teflon tipped hydrashocks so effective
in spite of big heavy kevlar armor - water may not be as good as teflon,
but I am not willing to bet my life on it.
As to raw strength, what makes Kevlar so good is that it will stretch.  It
is relatively useless against sharp objects such as knives which do not
present a wide surface.

BREAKING -- SUNDAY Nov. 7 2004: Freedom of Information requests at
 have unearthed two Ciber certification
reports indicating that security and tamperability was NOT TESTED and that
several state elections directors, a secretary of state, and computer
consultant Dr. Britain Williams signed off on the report anyway,
certifying it.
Black Box Voting has taken the position that fraud took place in the 2004
election through electronic voting machines. We base this on hard
evidence, documents obtained in public records requests, inside
information, and other data indicative of manipulation of electronic
voting systems. What we do not know is the specific scope of the fraud. We
are working now to compile the proof, based not on soft evidence -- red
flags, exit polls -- but core documents obtained by Black Box Voting in
the most massive Freedom of Information action in history.
SUNDAY Nov. 7 2004: We.re awaiting independent analysis on some pretty
crooked-looking elections. In the mean time, here.s something to chew on.
Your local elections officials trusted a group called NASED -- the
National Association of State Election Directors -- to certify that your
voting system is safe.
This trust was breached.
NASED certified the systems based on the recommendation of an .Independent
Testing Authority. (ITA).
What no one told local officials was that the ITA did not test for
security (and NASED didn.t seem to mind).
The ITA reports are considered so secret that even the California
Secretary of State.s office had trouble getting its hands on one. The ITA
refused to answer any questions about what it does. Imagine our surprise
when, due to Freedom of Information requests, a couple of them showed up
in our mailbox.
The most important test on the ITA report is called the .penetration
analysis.. This test is supposed to tell us whether anyone can break into
the system to tamper with the votes.
.Not applicable,. wrote Shawn Southworth, of Ciber Labs, the ITA that
tested the Diebold GEMS central tabulator software. .Did not test..
Shawn Southworth .tested. whether every candidate on the ballot has a
name. But we were shocked to find out that, when asked the most important
question -- about vulnerable entry points -- Southworth.s report says .not
 Ciber .tested.whether the manual gives a description of the voting
system. But when asked to identify methods of attack (which we think the
American voter would consider pretty important), the top-secret report
says .not applicable..
Ciber .tested. whether ballots comply with local regulations, but when Bev
Harris asked Shawn Southworth what he thinks about Diebold tabulators
accepting large numbers of .minus. votes, he said he didn.t mention that
in his report because .the vendors don.t like him to put anything
negative. in his report. After all, he said, he is paid by the vendors.
Shawn Southworth didn.t do the penetration analysis, but check out what he
.Ciber recommends to the NASED committee that GEMS software version
1.18.15 be certified and assigned NASED certification number
Was this just a one-time oversight?
Nope. It appears to be more like a habit. Here is the same Ciber
certification section for VoteHere; as you can see, the critical security
test, the .penetration analysis. was again marked .not applicable. and was
not done.
Maybe another ITA did the penetration analysis?
Apparently not. We discovered an even more bizarre Wyle Laboratories
report. In it, the lab admits the Sequoia voting system has problems, but
says that since they were not corrected earlier, Sequoia could continue
with the same flaws. At one point the Wyle report omits its testing
altogether, hoping the vendor will do the test.
Computer Guys: Be your own ITA certifier.
Here is a copy of the full Ciber report (part 1, 2, 3, 4) on GEMS 1.18.15.
Here is a zip file download for the GEMS 1.18.15 program. Here is a real
live Diebold vote database. Compare your findings against the official
testing lab and see if you agree with what Ciber says. E-mail us your
TIPS: The password for the vote database is .password. and you should
place it in the .LocalDB. directory in the GEMS folder, which you.ll find
in .program files..
Who the heck is NASED?
They are the people who certified this stuff.
You.ve gotta ask yourself: Are they nuts? Some of them are computer
experts. Well, it seems that several of these people suddenly want to
retire, and the whole NASED voting systems board is becoming somewhat
defunct, but these are the people responsible for today's shoddy voting
If the security of the U.S. electoral system depends on you to certify a
voting system, and you get a report that plainly states that security was
.not tested. and .not applicable. -- what would you do?
Perhaps we should ask them. Go ahead. Let's hold them accountable for the
election we just had. (Please, e-mail us their answers) They don't make it
very easy to get their e-mail and fax information; when you find it, let
us know and we'll post it here.

We now have evidence that certainly looks like altering a computerized
voting system during a real election, and it happened just six weeks ago.
MONDAY Nov 1 2004: New information indicates that hackers may be targeting
the central computers counting our votes tomorrow. All county elections
officials who use modems to transfer votes from polling places to the
central vote-counting server should disconnect the modems now.
There is no down side to removing the modems. Simply drive the vote
cartridges from each polling place in to the central vote-counting
location by car, instead of transmitting by modem. .Turning off. the
modems may not be sufficient. Disconnect the central vote counting server
from all modems, INCLUDING PHONE LINES, not just Internet.
In a very large county, this will add at most one hour to the
vote-counting time, while offering significant protection from outside
It appears that such an attack may already have taken place, in a primary
election 6 weeks ago in King County, Washington -- a large jurisdiction
with over one million registered voters. Documents, including internal
audit logs for the central vote-counting computer, along with modem
.trouble slips. consistent with hacker activity, show that the system may
have been hacked on Sept. 14, 2004. Three hours is now missing from the
vote-counting computer's "audit log," an automatically generated record,
similar to the black box in an airplane, which registers certain kinds of
COMPUTER FOLKS:
Here are the details about remote access vulnerability through the modem
connecting polling place voting machines with the central vote-counting
server in each county elections office. This applies specifically to all
Diebold systems (1,000 counties and townships), and may also apply to
other vendors. The prudent course of action is to disconnect all modems,
since the downside is small and the danger is significant.
The central servers are installed on unpatched, open Windows computers and
use RAS (Remote Access Server) to connect to the voting machines through
telephone lines. Since RAS is not adequately protected, anyone in the
world, even terrorists, who can figure out the server's phone number can
change vote totals without being detected by observers.
The passwords in many locations are easily guessed, and the access phone
numbers can be learned through social engineering or war dialing.
ELECTION OFFICIALS: The only way to protect tomorrow's election from this
type of attack is to disconnect the servers from the modems now. Under
some configurations, attacks by remote access are possible even if the
modem appears to be turned off. The modem lines should be physically
We obtained these documents through a public records request. The video
was taken at a press conference held by the King County elections chief
Friday Oct 29.
The audit log is a computer-generated automatic record similar to the
"black box" in an airplane, that automatically records access to the
Diebold GEMS central tabulator (unless, of course, you go into it in the
clandestine way we demonstrated on September 22 in Washington DC at the
National Press club.)
The central tabulator audit log is an FEC-required security feature. The
kinds of things it detects are the kinds of things you might see if
someone was tampering with the votes: Opening the vote file, previewing
and/or printing interim results, altering candidate definitions (a method
that can be used to flip votes).
Three hours is missing altogether from the Sept. 14 Washington State
primary held six weeks ago.
Here is a copy of the GEMS audit log.
Note that all entries from 9:52 p.m. until 1:31 a.m. are missing.
One report that GEMS automatically puts in the audit log is the "summary
report." This is the interim results report. We obtained the actual Sept.
14 summary reports, printed directly from the King County tabulator GEMS
program, because we went there and watched on election night and collected
these reports. These reports were also collected by party observers,
candidates, and were on the Web site for King County.
Here are summary reports which are now missing from the audit log.
Note the time and date stamps on the reports. Note also that they are
signed by Dean Logan, King County elections chief. We have the original
reports signed in ink on election night.
What does all this mean?
We know that summary reports show up in the audit log.
There are other audit logs, like the one that tracks modem transmissions,
but this audit log tracks summary reports.
Dean Logan held a press conference Friday morning, Oct. 29. Kathleen
Wynne, a citizen investigator for Black Box Voting, attended the press
conference and asked Dean Logan why three hours are missing from the audit
Here is a video clip
Logan said the empty three hours is because no reports were printed. OK.
But we have summary reports from 10:34 p.m., 11:38 p.m., 12:11 a.m., 12:46
a.m., and 1:33 p.m. These reports were during the time he said no reports
were run. Either the software malfunctioned, or audit log items were
deleted. Because remote access through the modems is possible, the system
may have been hacked, audit log deleted, without Logan realizing it.
Perhaps there are two of this particular kind of audit log? Perhaps this
is an incomplete one?
Bev Harris called King County elections office records employee Mary Stoa,
asking if perhaps there are any other audit logs at all. Mary Stoa called
back, reporting that according to Bill Huennikens of King County
elections, the audit log supplied to us in our public records request is
the only one and the comprehensive and complete one.
Perhaps it is a computer glitch?
The audit log is 168 pages long and spans 120 days, and the 3 hours just
happen to be missing during the most critical three hours on election
Diebold says altering the audit log cannot be done. Of course, we know a
chimpanzee can't get into an elections office and play with the computer,
but to demonstrate how easy it is to delete audit log entries, we taught a
chimpanzee to delete audit records using an illicit "back door" to get
into the program, Diebold told reporters it was a "magic show." Yet,
Diebold's own internal memos show they have known the audit log could be
altered since 2001!
Here is a Diebold memo from October 2001, titled "Altering the audit log,"
written by Diebold principal engineer Ken Clark:

Here is Dean Logan, telling a Channel 5 King-TV News reporter that there

HOW TO MONITOR THE CENTRAL TABULATOR: Black Box Voting developed these
guidelines to help you create an audit log, which can then be compared
with the FEC-required computer-generated audit log inside the computer.
Yes, this is a lot of stuff, and it might feel overwhelming, but whatever
you can do -- it is very much appreciated.
THINGS TO BRING WITH YOU
- A notebook and pen. Preferably a notebook with a sewn binding, if you
can find one. Do not take notes on a computer.
- A cell phone
- Binoculars
If you can, also bring these:
- A camera
- A small tape recorder
- A video camera, with a zoom lens if possible
Note that some counties will require you to turn off your video camera
during the entering of passwords, a valid request. You should, however, be
able to videotape the rest. Don.t pull your camera out right away. Avoid
confrontation by leaving your video camera in the bag -- better yet, a
purse. Pull it out only when there is an event of significance.
HUMAN FACTORS
You can.t be effective if you make assumptions or let others intimidate
- Don.t let others make you feel dumb.
- Make no assumptions about security. It might be worse than you expect.
- Don.t count on the accuracy of anything other people tell you, even if
they work for the county or the vendor.
- About party observers, techies, or lawyers: Remember that they have not
examined the actual software or setup, and they are operating on
assumptions, hearsay, or in some cases, may be trying to misdirect your
- Vendor contracts prohibit county officials from examining their own
software. Elections officials may just be repeating what someone else (the
vendor) has told them.
YOUR ROLE AS AN OBSERVER: CREATE YOUR OWN AUDIT LOG so it can be compared
to the real audit log.
Write down the following. For every event, write the date, time, including
1. NAMES & AFFILIATIONS: Get the names of everyone there. Find out
2. WHERE ARE THE COMPUTERS: Establish the number and location of all vote
tabulation computers. They call them different things: tabulators,
servers. What you want is the computer that adds up all the votes from
everywhere in the county.
- Some counties have only one. If there are more than one, find out where
each one is. If there is more than one tabulator, ask if they are
networked together and find out if any of them are in places you can.t
3. SYNCHRONIZE YOUR WATCH with the central vote-tally computer. Ask
officials to tell you the time on the computer. If more than one, ask for
the time of each and the ID number of each.
log the date and time, to the minute, in this format:
Nov 02 2004 11:25 p.m.
Nov. 03 2004 01:15 a.m.
CREATE A LOG FOR THE FOLLOWING:
People: Ask names and affiliations for, and log the START and STOP time
a. Who accesses the terminal (the keyboard and screen)
b. Who sits at the terminal
c. Who accesses the server (the computer the screen is hooked up to)
d. Who enters and leaves the room
COMPUTER ACTIVITIES: Log the START and STOP time for the following events
and write down the name of the person involved:
a. Putting disks, CDs, or any other item in the computer
b. Taking disks, CDs, or any other item out of the computer
c. Uploading disks, CDs, or any other item
d. Viewing a preview of a report
e. Putting a report on the Web, even if this is done from another computer
f. Printing a report
g. NOTE WHAT.S ON THE SCREEN: Use binoculars to view the screen.
- Note upload icons.
- Use binoculars to read and record error messages. Note the time.
- Note indicators of processes, when a status bar shows how much is left
to do
h. PROGRAM CRASHES:
- Watch to see if the program suddenly disappears from the screen (a
program crash) or any system error message appears. If so, note the time
and other details, and see below for how to record system crashes.
- Get the date and time and note who was at the computer
- Note whether any results were being transmitted or uploaded at the time
the crash occurred.
- Did the crash take down the whole computer or did it just close the
tabulator program unexpectedly.
- Log all activities and conversations that occur just after the crash. If
have a tape recorder, leave it in your purse, now is the time to turn it
on. But keep making notes regardless of whether you have tape, and trust
your gut. What you think might be important is probably important.
WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING YOU CAN FIND OUT ABOUT MODEMS.
i. Note when, where, and who feeds ballot data into the computer in the
central office. Describe what they are feeding the cards into, where the
items are located, who does it, and when.
j. DISK MANAGEMENT:
- Note what kind of data storage device is used to move data around. You
are looking for floppy disks, CDs, USB keys (about the size of a pack of
- Note where they get the disk from originally (whether it was from the
machine, meaning it could have a program or data on it already, or out of
a package of new disks).
- Track the chain of custody: Where it is taken, and have someone watch it
when taken to any other machine, note what programs you can see on the
other machine
- Note whether (and what time) it comes back and if it is put into the
machine again.
k. Moving the results: They have to move the results somehow. Ask
questions about their procedures.
- Is someone coming and going every hour or so with paper results?
- Are they moving results to the Internet with a floppy or CD or USB key
(looks like a little piece of plastic, about the size of a piece of gum)
- If no one is leaving the machine to post the results, chances are they
are doing this at the computer, meaning they are probably hooked up to a
network or the Internet. Ask questions about the details and record what
they say, and the name of the person who says it.
l. If you see somebody open a web page or they do something that lets you
know there has been Internet access, write it down.
m. BEHAVIORAL CUES:
- Note whether people look worried or stressed. Log the time it begins and
the time it ends and who they are.
- A now a word about .wranglers.. Some elections offices appoint a person

Secret code TELWA cracked: Nazi decoder developed computer forerunner
23. September 2004
Hanover - the decoder Reinhold Weber decoded the US
secret code TELWA in the Second World War and built a decoding machine
to crack M-209-Nachrichten. This was now revealed by Klaus Schmeh, author
at the InterNet magazine Telepolis
That German decoding specialists decoded in the the Second World War
secret code of the allied was even not well known by experts until a few
years ago. According to report of the former president of the Federal
Office for security in the information technology (BSI), Dr Otto
Leiberichm the Germans in the Second World War cracked the US coding
machine M-209.
These remarks served the Telepolis author Klaus Schmeh as
important source of information, when he worked on his book
'Die Welt der geheimen Zeichen - Die faszinierende Geschichte der Verschl|sselung'
('The world of the secret signs - the fascinating history of encryption).
When he published excerpts of this book with Telepolis first, this led to a
small sensation: A 84 year old man from Frankfurt contacted him and reported
that he was in WWII involved in the crackong of the mentioned US coding machine M-209.
The 1920 in Austria born Reinold Weber, which had spent six years of
his childhood in the USA, was drawn in 1941 to the armed forces. Due to
excellent knowledge of the english language he was first trained as a message
interpreter and later as decoder. Inserted in the decoding unit
FNAST5, he succeeded to decode the TELWA messages from US radiograms
and decipher also machine keys. In this time Weber and his
colleagues cracked the codes of the US coding machine M-209 and intercepted
explosive information. Thus there were again and again hints referring to
forthcoming bombardments of German cities, which were announced usually
about six to eight weeks before execution in radiograms. What counter
measures the German military did with the help of these information,
weber however never experienced.
In April 1944 Weber had the idea to build a machine which should
automate a part of the laborious deciphering computations. The company
Hollerith, late IBM, was positive in an evaluation, explained however
the building of such a machine takes about two years. Thus Weber with a
colleague made itself alone to the work. They created a machine, which
consisted of two boxes: one in the size of a desk, which contained the
relays and the four turning rollers, as well as a further box with 80 x
80 x 40 cm edge length. Latter box contained 26 times 16 bulb sockets,
with which by bulbs the letters of the relative attitude could be
copied. Thus Webers and his colleague wrote an interesting piece of
technology history, because their construction had already many thing in common
with a computer with their binary logic. The computer was still
not at all invented at this time, if one refrains from the British
machine Colossus likewise developed for decoding, which developed about
at the same time.
In the middle of September 1944 Weber could prove the strength of its computer
forerunner for the first time: During a night duty he
determined with his machine - without the support of his
colleagues - an M209 key. Which would have meant one week work without machine
assistance for a three-team at least, he created within approximately
seven hours. At the beginning of of 1945, weber had landed over several
detours in Salzburg, wanted to use his decoding machine again. However
the necessary radio engineering was missing. The equipment proved as
useless. Its superior instructed to destroy the machine. With pickel,
hatchet, hammer and stahlsaege Weber scrapped thereupon the equipment,
whose construction had employed him several months long.
Thus a historically extremely interesting computer forerunner
disappeared again from the scene. Until today this equipment in no
source of literature is mentioned to computer history.

Government wants ID arguments secret
Monday, September 6, 2004 Posted: 4:07 PM EDT (2007 GMT)
SAN FRANCISCO, California (AP) -- The U.S. Department of Justice has asked
an appellate court to keep its arguments secret for a case in which
privacy advocate John Gilmore is challenging federal requirements to show
identification before boarding an airplane.
A federal statute and other regulations "prohibit the disclosure of
sensitive security information, and that is precisely what is alleged to
be at issue here," the government said in court papers filed Friday with
the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Disclosing the restricted
information "would be detrimental to the security of transportation," the
government wrote.
Attorneys for Gilmore, a 49-year-old San Francisco resident who co-founded
the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties group, said they
don't buy the government's argument and that its latest request raises
only more questions.
"We're dealing with the government's review of a secret law that now they
want a secret judicial review for," one of Gilmore's attorneys, James
Harrison, said in a phone interview Sunday. "This administration's use of
a secret law is more dangerous to the security of the nation than any
external threat."
Gilmore first sued the government and several airlines in July 2002 after
airline agents refused to let him board planes in San Francisco and
Oakland without first showing an ID or submitting to a more intense
search. He claimed in his lawsuit the ID requirement was vague and
ineffective and violated his constitutional protections against illegal
searches and seizures.
A U.S. District Court judge earlier this year dismissed his claims against
the airlines, but said his challenge to the government belonged in a
federal appellate court.
Now in his appellate case, Gilmore maintains the federal government has
yet to disclose the regulations behind the ID requirement to which he was
"How are people supposed to follow laws if they don't know what they are?"
Harrison said.
The government contends its court arguments should be sealed from public
view and heard before a judge outside the presence of Gilmore and his
attorneys. The government, however, said it would plan to file another
redacted public version of its arguments.
A date for a hearing on the matter has not yet been set.

are then called "decisions" :-/

Absolutely correct.
I am however intrigued that they may be preparing to posit that secret
rules (which act under color of law) can be enforced without being
described publicly.  This, if accepted, would effectively end all
constitutional protections.

"At trial, the judge threw out all Henson's witnesses, disallowed any
testimony about his reasons for picketing the cult, and allowed the
prosecution to present excerpts from Henson's Internet postings out of
context; the Scientology witnesses also committed perjury which Henson was
unable to rebut."
The worst part of all this is that the underlying charges of "terrorism"
were based on this *obviously* sarcastic thread from usenet:
This is an incredibly serious abuse of our so-called "justice system" -
anything you can do to help Henson out may come back to help *you* out
someday.  No none of the cosmic karma crap, but I guarantee you that if we

evidence at trial (a rapidly increasing practice in our "courts"), we will

Hi all,
I don't know if this is appropriate on this list, but I know that
diebold voting systems have been an issue in the cryptography community
for a while now. Having said that, I'm pasting an article that I
received (from my parents actually) that might be of interest to this
group. If it is not, just moderate :)
*Subject:* Black Box
Darkness is settling over the election process in San Diego.  I say get
rid of anything electronic that has  to do with elections. Realistic
VIEWING THE DIEBOLD VOTE-TALLYING SCREEN PROHIBITED
Jim March, a member of the Black Box Voting board of directors,
was arrested Tuesday evening for trying to observe the Diebold
central tabulator (vote tallying machine) as the votes were being
counted in San Diego's mayoral election (July 26).
(- online discussion: http:/ -)
According to Jim Hamilton, an elections integrity advocate from
San Diego, he and March visited the office of the registrar
of elections earlier in the day. During this visit, March made
two requests, which were refused by Mikel Haas, the San Diego
Registrar of elections.
1) March asked that the central tabulator, the computer that
tallies up the votes from all the precincts, be positioned so
that citizens could observe it. According to Hamilton, this
would have required simply moving a table a few feet.
2) March also asked for a copy of the ".gbf" files -- the vote
tally files collected during the course of tabulation - to be
provided for examination after the election.
During the tallying of the election, the Diebold computer
was positioned too far away for citizens to read the screen.
Citizens could not watch error messages, or even perceive
significant anomalies or malfunctions.
Unable to see the screen, March went into the office where the
tabulator was housed. Two deputies followed him and escorted
him out.
According to Hamilton: "He was not belligerent, not at all.
After he went inside the tabulator room he came [was escorted]
out and he said clearly 'I'm not resisting.' They handcuffed
him, took him out of the building. They put him in a squad car.
They're going to take him to the police station, book him and
take him to jail," said Hamilton. "He's getting charged with a
felony, 'interfering with an election official.'"
March's actions are the culmination of two years of increasing
frustration with the refusal of election officials to respond to
security deficiencies in the voting machines. The software that
tallies the votes in San Diego is made by Diebold Election Systems,
a company that has already paid the state of California $2.8 million
for making false claims, due to a lawsuit filed by March and Black
Box Voting founder Bev Harris.
On July 4, a report was released by European computer security
expert Harri Hursti, revealing that the Diebold voting system
contains profound architectural flaws. "It is open for business,"
says Hursti, who demonstrated the flaws on Leon County, Florida
Diebold machines. He penetrated the voting system in less than
five minutes, manipulating vote reports in a way that was
Despite the critical security alert issued by Hursti, San Diego
County sent 713 voting machines home with poll workers, increasing
the risk that the "memory cards" housed in the machines could be
hacked, and removing the argument that "inside access" was carefully
The arrest of Jim March underlines a fundamental problem facing
Americans today as, increasingly, they lose the ability to monitor,
verify, or watch any part of the counting process.
The San Diego registrar of elections knew of the security flaws in
the voting system. Diebold has never denied the vulnerability
identified in Hursti's report, found at
Despite knowledge of the increased risks, Haas made the decision
to create additional vulnerability by sending the machines home
with hundreds of poll workers.
While San Diego officials will no doubt point to a small seal on
the compartment housing the memory card (the component exploited
in Hursti's study), Black Box Voting has interviewed a former
San Diego poll worker, who reported that all that is necessary
to dislodge and then reaffix the seal is a small pair of pliers.
IN A NUTSHELL:
- The machines have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to
undetected tampering
- The San Diego registrar of voters chose not to take
appropriate precautions
- The main tally machine was placed in a location that was
impossible for citizens to observe
- Many voting integrity advocates have come to believe that
 voting machine reform now rivals the urgency of the Civil
Rights movement in the 1960s.
Jim March acted on those beliefs.

Second, as the guy who spent several years being the carrier schmuck on
call for these kinds of attacks, a 300mbps attack is a pretty small one.
Big enough to knock off the average web site or small ISP, but pretty
small from the carrier perspective.  He probably knew the sizeof the
incoming attack because the voice on the other end of the phone (the
carrier schmuck on call) told him how much data he saw coming down the
pipe at the target.
Hopefully that'll clear some of the muddy stuff?

Lets not forget the lessons of the NYC Methadone "Maintenance" Programs
either.  While heroin results in crime due to high cost (by virtue of
illegalization), the legal version also creates crime due to it's high
cost.  The MMPs have the same "Money or else" position that the junkie
faces on the street, and while the prices are certainly lower, they are
NOT "low".  In 1983 a junkie expected to pay $40-$80 per *day* for
maintenance (I'm sure it's a lot higher today).  Along with legalization
must come the removal of monopoly practices such a single sourcing of the
drug and prescriptions to dispense.  Only then does the free market take
over and keep the price, and the crime, low.

facts and circumstances known to us, however, I am convinced that if we
wait, a threat will continue to materialize in Iraq that could cause
incalculable damage to world peace in general, and to the United States in
particular. Bill Frist, Senate Majority Leader Letter to Future of Freedom
Foundation 3/1/2003
Iraq is a grave threat to this nation. It desires to acquire and use
weapons of mass terror and is run by a despot with a proven record of
willingness to use them. Iraq has had 12 years to comply with UN
requirements for disarmament and has failed to do so. The president is
right to say it's time has run out. Bill Frist, Senate Majority Leader
Senate Speech 3/7/2003
So has the strategic decision been made to disarm Iraq of its weapons of
mass destruction by the leadership in Baghdad? . . . I think our judgment
has to be clearly not. Colin Powell, Secretary of State Remarks to UN
Security Council 3/7/2003
Getting rid of Saddam Hussein's regime is our best inoculation. Destroying
once and for all his weapons of disease and death is a vaccination for the

Let's talk about the nuclear proposition for a minute. We know that based
on intelligence, that [Saddam] has been very, very good at hiding these
kinds of efforts. He's had years to get good at it and we know he has been
absolutely devoted to trying to acquire nuclear weapons. And we believe he
has, in fact, reconstituted nuclear weapons. Dick Cheney, Vice President
Meet The Press 3/16/2003
Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that
the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal
weapons ever devised. George W. Bush, President Address to the Nation
The United States . . . is now at war "so we will not ever see" what
terrorists could do "if supplied with weapons of mass destruction by
Saddam Hussein." Bill Frist, Senate Majority Leader Senate Debate
Well, there is no question that we have evidence and information that Iraq
has weapons of mass destruction, biological and chemical particularly . .

duration it takes. Ari Fleischer, Press Secretary Press Briefing 3/21/2003
There is no doubt that the regime of Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of

One of our top objectives is to find and destroy the WMD. There are a

We still need to find and secure Iraq's weapons of mass destruction
facilities and secure Iraq's borders so we can prevent the flow of weapons
of mass destruction materials and senior regime officials out of the
country. Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense Press Conference 4/9/2003
You bet we're concerned [concerned that those weapons might have been
shipped out of the country]about it. And one of the reasons it's important
is because the nexus between terrorist states with weapons of mass
destruction ... and terrorist groups -- networks -- is a critical link.
And the thought that ... some of those materials could leave the country
and [get] in the hands of terrorist networks would be a very unhappy
prospect. So it is important to us to see that that doesn't happen. Donald
Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense Press Conference 4/9/2003
Obviously the administration intends to publicize all the weapons of mass

But make no mistake -- as I said earlier -- we have high confidence that
they have weapons of mass destruction. That is what this war was about and

I have absolute confidence that there are weapons of mass destruction
inside this country. Whether we will turn out, at the end of the day, to

with will tell us, ``Oh, well, there's actually another site,'' and we'll
find it there, I'm not sure. General Tommy Franks, Commander in Chief
Central Command Fox New 4/13/2003
We are learning more as we interrogate or have discussions with Iraqi
scientists and people within the Iraqi structure, that perhaps he
destroyed some, perhaps he dispersed some. And so we will find them.

The President is indeed satisfied with the intelligence that he received.
And I think that's borne out by the fact that, just as Secretary Powell
described at the United Nations, we have found the bio trucks that can be
used only for the purpose of producing biological weapons. That's
proof-perfect that the intelligence in that regard was right on target.
Ari Fleischer, Press Secretary Press Briefing 5/29/2003
We have teams of people that are out looking. They've investigated a
number of sites. And within the last week or two, they have in fact
captured and have in custody two of the mobile trailers that Secretary
Powell talked about at the United Nations as being biological weapons
laboratories. Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense Infinity Radio

You remember when [Secretary of State] Colin Powell stood up in front of
the world, and he said Iraq has got laboratories, mobile labs to build
biological weapons ...They're illegal. They're against the United Nations

as time goes on. George W. Bush, President Press Briefing 5/30/2003
It was a surprise to me then -- it remains a surprise to me now -- that we
have not uncovered weapons, as you say, in some of the forward dispersal
sites. Believe me, it's not for lack of trying. We've been to virtually
every ammunition supply point between the Kuwaiti border and Baghdad, but
they're simply not there. Lt. Gen. James Conway, 1st Marine Expeditionary

I would put before you Exhibit A, the mobile biological labs that we have

Yes, they are. And the DCI, George Tenet, Director of Central

State Fox News Interview 6/8/2003
No one ever said that we knew precisely where all of these agents were,
where they were stored Condoleeza Rice, US National Security Advisor Meet
the Press 6/8/2003
What the president has said is because it's been the long-standing view of
numerous people, not only in this country, not only in this
administration, but around the world, including at the United Nations, who
came to those conclusions...And the president is not going to engage in
the rewriting of history that others may be trying to engage in. Ari
Fleischer, Press Secretary Response to Question From Press 6/9/2003
Iraq had a weapons program...Intelligence throughout the decade showed
they had a weapons program. I am absolutely convinced with time we'll find
out they did have a weapons program. George W. Bush, President Comment to
Reporters 6/9/2003
The biological weapons labs that we believe strongly are biological
weapons labs, we didn't find any biological weapons with those labs. But
should that give us any comfort? Not at all. Those were labs that could
produce biological weapons whenever Saddam Hussein might have wanted to
have a biological weapons inventory. Colin Powell, Secretary of State
Associated Press Interview 6/12/2003
Those documents were only one piece of evidence in a larger body of
evidence suggesting that Iraq attempted to purchase uranium from Africa
... The issue of Iraq's pursuit of uranium in Africa is supported by
multiple sources of intelligence. The other sources of evidence did and do
support the president's statement. Sean McCormack, National Security
Council Spokesman Statement to press 6/13/2003
My personal view is that their intelligence has been, I'm sure, imperfect,
but good. In other words, I think the intelligence was correct in general,
and that you always will find out precisely what it was once you get on
the ground and have a chance to talk to people and explore it, and I think
that will happen. Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense Press Briefing
I have reason, every reason, to believe that the intelligence that we were
operating off was correct and that we will, in fact, find weapons or
evidence of weapons, programs, that are conclusive. But that's just a
matter of time...It's now less than eight weeks since the end of major
combat in Iraq and I believe that patience will prove to be a virtue
Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense Pentagon media briefing. 6/24/2003
MS. BLOCK: There were no toxins found in those trailers. SECRETARY POWELL:
Which could mean one of several things: one, they hadn't been used yet to
develop toxins; or, secondly, they had been sterilized so thoroughly that
there is no residual left. It may well be that they hadn't been used yet.
Colin Powell, Secretary of State All Things Considered, Interview
That was the concern we had with Saddam Hussein. Not only did he have
weapons -- and we'll uncover not only his weapons but all of his weapons
programs -- he never lost the intent to have these kinds of weapons. Colin
Powell, Secretary of State All Things Considered, Interview 6/27/2003
I think the burden is on those people who think he didn't have weapons of
mass destruction to tell the world where they are. Ari Fleischer, Press

For those of you who may have missed it, today was the first day of the
new "Real ID Act", a/k/a, the American Nazification Papers Act.  I
wouldn't have know myself except that I recently moved, and wanted to
exchange my current Illinois drivers license for a Missouri one.
Not so fast...
"You have a passport?"
"No, I don't travel."
"A certified copy of your original birth certificate?"
"Haven't had one since I was born, fifty years ago.  And since I was born
about 1500 miles from here, getting one is no small task."
"Too bad.  Your old license is invalid and you can't get another one in
any state, starting today, without at least one of the two documents, PLUS
secondary ID to back them up."
Even though I have a current license, and even though I am in their system
as having held a valid Missouri license for 15+ years, photo included,
none of it is good enough.
OK, so I have no choice, I go to the post office to get a Passport - same
Fine, I'll just order the birth certificate and get it over with, right?
Wrong.  New York wants affirmative proof of identity for a copy now:
passport or your [missing] original birth certificate.  Anyone else see a
circular problem here?
"I need a new birth certificate because the old one was lost about forty
years ago. And I don't have a passport to prove my identity."
"Get your parents to testify who you are, and make sure they bring their
"They are both dead."
"Sorry Sir, I'm afraid we won't be able to help you then."
Durbin was right.  And he didn't even scratch the surface!  Anyone who
thinks this "Real ID Act" is about getting false ID out of the hands of
"The Terrorists" is an idiot: they will simply print their own drivers
licenses - this is about forcing the regular population to get used to
intrastate passports.  This act essentially forces you to have a passport
for everyday things like banking, car purchases and certain repairs,
checks, etc.
We have literally allowed the Nazification to begin, and we've even
welcomed it with eager open arms - all in the name of "Fighting Terror".

When last I wrote, I was facing a dilemma: how to get a copy of my brith
certificate so that I could get a copy of my birth certificate :-/
I managed to "clear the hurdle" of the missing brith certificate.  Kinda.
Sorta maybe...
So, new certificate in hand, I went off to the DMV to get my picture taken
(wearing my "Frisk Me, I'm A Terrorist" T-Shirt of course).  At 8:50am I
was eagerly awaiting the opening of the local DMV office, and by the
opening bell at 9:00, there was actually a *line* behind me!
I rushed to the counter, plopped down my proof of insurance, proof of
address (a recent mailed in voter reg card), my old Illinois drivers
license, social security card, and held my breath.
They took them, and handed me back a form to check that everything was
correct prior to snapping the pic.  Oddly, it wasn't: the date of birth
was wrong, and it took them about 15 minutes to fix it (apparently the
computers are programmed to avoid the changing of a DOB, and they were
dumbfounded at how to proceed).  Finally, the moment arrived, and I was
the proud owner of not just a new Missouri driver's license (with clearly
shoing T-Shirt on the photo), but a Missouri state ID as well.
Then it was my wife's turn.  Unfortunately, she was turned away: even
though she had everything I did, she forgot to bring a certified copy of
our marriage license!  Without it, they refused to use her married name
for the license...  I trudged over to the city for a copy of said marriage
license, and lo, of course, there was aline out the door - women of every
age and description suddenly finding it necessary to get a certified copy
of their marriage license!  What a shocker - the Collector of Revenue is
having a field day with this.
She will try again tomorrow, and I certain that this time it will all
"work out", but still, I am left with disturbing questions.  For instance,
when we went to get *her* birth certificate, why did they not give a damn
*who* was asking for it?  Why is everyone on earth getting to charge an
extra $12.00 here and $12.00 there to allow us the privelege of complying
with this absurd law (which, BTW, even the fucking British refuse to
pass)?  This country is out of control, bouncing endlessly between
administrative fiat and endless taxation, and all we can worry about is
that some ephemeral "Terrorist" is going to blow up a bus?  To be honest,
I'm *far* more worried that George will blow up another country that I am
about some guy stealing my ID and using it to defeat democracy in

CHICAGO, Illinois (AP) -- Police installed video surveillance cameras
around town and saw Chicago's murder rate fall to its lowest level in four
decades. Now the cops hope to further cut crime by not only watching, but
listening, too.
The city is employing new technology that recognizes the sound of a
gunshot within a two-block radius, pinpoints the source, turns a
surveillance camera toward the shooter and places a 911 call.
Welcome to crime-fighting in the 21st century.
"Instead of just having eyes, you have the advantage of both eyes and
ears," said Bryan Baker, chief executive of Safety Dynamics LLC, the
company in suburban Oak Brook that makes the systems.
The technology isn't just gaining favor in Chicago, where 30 of the
devices have already been installed in high-crime neighborhoods alongside
video surveillance cameras. Baker says dozens more installations will

Safety Dynamics also works with the U.S. Army and Navy, developing systems
that could detect a range of sounds such as glass shattering or diesel
trucks slowing in an unexpected location.

of almost-anarchy.  The entire time, these reports of the "Citizens of 39"
(or is it 93?) having an existence both outside the reach of law and at
the same time as a valuable state resource (read cheap labor pool) have
harkened back to this most interesting postulate by Mr. Norton.
Am I the only one who has been watching the fun and wondering if we are
witnessing our first feral birth?

Press Release
  PivX Solutions Files for Patent Protection and Discloses New Inventions
 Newport Beach, CA  July 27, 2006  PivX Solutions, Inc., a vendor of
Windows intrusion prevention software, today announced the filing of a
provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
in which the company discloses new inventions as well as seeks patent
protection for key aspects of its PreEmpt 2.0 intrusion prevention
security product for Windows computers.
 "Filing for patent protection is a necessary step in the growth of any
business that owns intellectual property. said Jason Coombs, CEO of PivX
Solutions. "Whenever we examine in forensic detail the actions and
thoughts a creative person produces, be it in the realm of purely artistic
creative expression or in a field of technological innovation, we find
specific ways in which that person's creativity was driven by measurable
units of tangible progress that further inspired more creative effort. The
PivX creative staff was remarkably creative and innovative in the face of
business difficulties. This provisional patent application reveals just
how novel and rewarding the company's work has been."
 The title of the provisional patent application, filed on July 25, 2006
reads as follows:
 "A System or Method of Creating Cryptographic Command or Control Channels
with Layers of Digital Signature Authentication or Verification of Digital
Communications Enabling Remote Control Over, or Distribution of Arbitrary
Reprogramming or Reconfiguration Instructions to, One or More General
Purpose Programmable Electronic Devices" and its inventors are Oliver
Lavery and Michael Bringle, et al.

@_subject: CP Sighting: Vista security spec 'longest suicide note in 
By Andrew Thomas: Sunday 24 December 2006, 16:43
VISTA'S CONTENT PROTECTION specification could very well constitute the
longest suicide note in history, claims a new and detailed report from the
University of Auckland in New Zealand.
"Peter Gutmann's report describes the pernicious DRM built into Vista and
required by MS for approval of hardware and drivers," said INQ reader Brad
Steffler, MD, who brought the report to our attention. "As a physician who
uses PCs for image review before I perform surgery, this situation is
intolerable. It is also intolerable for me as a medical school professor
as I will have to switch to a MAC or a Linux PC. These draconian dicta
just might kill the PC as we know it."
But this isn't just a typical anti-Microsoft rant. Gutmann's report runs
to 6,000 words and contains hardly any FSF-style juvenile invective.
"Windows Vista includes an extensive reworking of core OS elements in
order to provide content protection for so-called "premium content",
typically HD data from Blu-Ray and HD-DVD sources. Providing this
protection incurs considerable costs in terms of system performance,
system stability, technical support overhead, and hardware and software
cost," says Gutmann on his homepage.
"These issues affect not only users of Vista but the entire PC industry,
since the effects of the protection measures extend to cover all hardware
and software that will ever come into contact with Vista, even if it's not
used directly with Vista (for example hardware in a Macintosh computer or
on a Linux server). This document analyses the cost involved in Vista's
content protection, and the collateral damage that this incurs throughout
the computer industry."
He also claims that Vista's content protection will 'have to violate the
laws of physics if it is to work'.
I'm not going to comment on the details of the report and its implications
but merely suggest that you read it for yourselves and come to your own
conclusions. I'd also venture to suggest that Microsoft might want to
comment on Gutmann's work.

@_subject: [dave@farber.net: [IP] more on AP Story Justice Dept.  
A couple of points trouble me here, to wit:
(1) We are describing encryptedmessage sent over the public internet -
granted, it's in "pieces", yet it's still sent into the public cloud;
(2) These various pieces are all "record" communications as far as
NSA/Echelon is concerned, and therefore we should expect that they will
draw significant attention - and end up in permanent archives;
(3) Since all off the pieces have been stored - including both the
encrypted messagetexts and the decryptors, what is to prevent a
time-faking attack against this message?  After all, if you have all the
parts, you can just "reinstantiate" the network as it was was the messages
were originally sent.
(4) For any form of time-destruction messaging to really work, the keying
information would have to be tied to a physical  that cannot be
reclaimed, and which decays at a fixed, known, and closely approximatable
rate (a radiodecay probably doesn't meet this criteria);
Every time-sensitive auto-destructing system Ive seen discussed here fails
these weaknesses.

Not that I am aware of, and if they did, I would by definition not trust
them.  I want my time-limited key to be some natural phenomenon that
cannot be recreated after it "dies", but which is "readable" (for keying)
and stable for a known time interval.
Is there radioactive material which has has a known property that can be
reliably and repetitively measured, that is useful as either a key or a
seed, and that is guaranteed to change on a known schedule in a
significant (i.e., keying data no longer relevant) way?
The idea being something like msg xor radioseed "keys" = plaintext, but
after 30 days, radioseed is different (and the original not knowable), and
therefore message is dead.

slavery in all of the United States. Once the CSA was defeated, approval

As usual, i'm late to the party.
I vote to bar the quesion. :-/
Which is a great intro to a few of the first random thoughts I had while
reading this missive from the Sooper Sekrit [French] Gub'mint Agent:
How convenient that Frog is the example used, as Frog is well known for
it's [successful] attack against the system.  What better way to get the
locals to start nodding their heads than to use this well known and long
identified broken node", while implicitly maintaining that 'Le Author"
does't know anything about that.
"About TOR now: I MAY not say all what I know, as the case is currently
investigated by our services and I don't want to get into trouble!"
Yet s/he chooses a "safe" remailer like service to "hide" behind? Wait - I
thought we just learned that _all_  remailers and their relatives were
under hostile control?
"About 4 years ago (I don't remember exactly, and I am at home now, I
haven't my documents with me), we visited the operator of the
remailers FROG and AZERTY."
Since when would an agent have the files from a four year old (assumedly
Black) "operation" easily at hand?
The rest of this latter is just well known crap smooshed together with a
Secret-Club Handshake and a warning to 'be careful' - no duh!
WTF was the actual _point_ of this in the first place?  What would the
possible payoff be?  The writer is for sure no secret agent, nor likely
even playing one in her garage: does he merely get off by posting stupid
shit on a public list?  Nobody truly familiar with any annonymizing
service is going to pay that thing any attention, but newbies *might*
(depending on their naivete and gullibility).  Even so, standing by
itself, it's not even a howl in the wind, it's a whisper on a

It is as yet unclear why TrustCenter ran out of money, but the fact that

@_subject: Brands signature revisited :-) 
Several weeks ago my wife was carping about something I didn't quite grok,
and really didn't care about - her virtual game world had put up a notice
(daily and repititiously apparently) that anyone found trading "IRL" would
be instantly wiped clean with no refund and no exceptions.  Apparently she
thought this was a rather large overreaction to what she thinks of as a
really small problem.
The only problem is that the USG disagrees with her assessment!
On the way home today I heard NPR running a story about the new "desk" at
Reuters: they have assigned a full time reporter to cover "business" in a
virtual world (2nd life).  This reporter described his appointment as a
normal reaction by Reuters to real "news" being made.  After all, this
virtual world has a thriving economy that has an actual physical exchange
setup to trade "Lindars" into USD (floating this A.M. at 207 Lindars to
one USD).  It appears the USG is so worried about all the real cash being
generated that they are *seriously* looking at setting physical taxes
against these virtual currencies (wherever there is a point of exchange).
Lets take this to its obvious limit - why hire a spammer to send
penisgrams when you can use that botnet to make Lindars?  Or, to quote a
friend of mine, "Great!  Kim Jung Il needs only to hire a few kids to beat
the embargoes!  Funny!!!".
Maybe funny, maybe not.
If these currencies are crossing the virtual / physical interfaces then
they have become real and real is (and always will be) taxable.  That
means that forgery is a real issue - enter Mr. B.
I find this fascinating!  We just went at this the wrong way!  Fuck

Prior to this "overreaction", I was receiving approximately 25K spam

Now, I see less than several hundred: a fair trade for the rare false

I have literally dozens of /8s on block: All of APNIC, AFRINIC, South

The policy here is that if an abusive email gets through:
(1) If generated by a hosting company, the entire allocation to that
hosting company is blocked;
(2) If from dynamic space, it was missed the first time, so added now;
(3) If from a microallocation (/25-/32) I block the micro, and if from a
company with significant space, but what appears to be just a compromised
host, the /24 in which that host lives.

Anyone here who can read/analyze/translate this into English?
Hi list!
I discovered a new method of integer factorization for any precision
numbers, probable it should be an end of RSA era.
Let N - the ring and N = p*q
Then, (-p) in terms of ring(N) is equal (N-p)
and respective:
p*(-q)=p*(N-q) - by the data, then
(-p)*q=q*(N-p) - by the data, then
Q. E. D.
Let N = p*q = A1*B1 + A2*B2... + An*Bn
Then exists some subset(A1...An) and respective subset(B1...Bn), which
satisfies for equality:
A1*(-B1)+A2*(-B2)...+An*(-Bn) = p*(-q)=p*q*(p-1)
A1*(-B1)+A2*(-B2)...+An*(-Bn) = (-p)*q=p*q*(q-1)
If found such (A1...An) and (B1...Bn), we can find p or q by dividing
p*(q-1) on p*q:
p*(q-1)=p*q*(p-1) => (p*(q-1))/(p*q)=(p-1) => (p-1)+1 = p
(p-1)*q=p*q*(q-1)=>((-p)*q)/(p*q)=(q-1) => (q-1)+1 = q
Sample: 21 = 3*7
Let's view a binary representation of this number: 10101 => 2^4 + 2^2 +
1 => 4*4+2*2+1*1
Then, we can try to find 7*(-3) in terms of ring(21):
4*(-4) + 2(-2) + 1*(-1) => 4*(21-4)+2*(21-2)+1*(21-1)=>4*17+2*19+1*20 =
68+38+20 = 126 = 6*21
This implementation of my gypothesis has very hard complexity (about a
log2(N)! comparations), but exists a short way with fixed complexity for
implementation of hypothesis ("plan B") - but, by ethical reason, I'll
not post it here.

What religion, please tell me, tells you as a follower of that religion to
occupy another country and kill its people? Please tell me. Does
Christianity tell its followers to do that? Judaism, for that matter?
Islam, for that matter? What prophet tells you to send 160,000 troops to
another country, kill men, women, and children? You just can't wear your

@_subject: Possible backdoor in FIPS SP 800-90 PRNG (fwd) 
Slashdot this morning has a posting about the possibility of a back door
in the elliptic curve random number generator in FIPS SP 800-90.
 has links to an
article by Bruce Schneier at wired.com, the standard, and the presentation
with the new result.
The work is by Dan Shumow and Niels Ferguson and was presented at the
Crypto 2007 rump session. Basically there are two elliptic curve points,
and if you know the discrete logarithm of one relative to the other,
you can reverse engineer the internal state just from the RNG outputs.
It's a very nice piece of analysis.
The problem is that NIST publishes a pair of points that they suggest you
use, in Appendix A.1, without giving any hint of how they were derived.
This leaves open the possibility that they were selected in such a way
as to exploit the Shumow/Ferguson back door.
Now, here's the strange thing. In Appendix A.2 NIST says that you can use
your own pair of points if you want to. But, they caution very strongly
that in that case, anyone relying on the PRNG should verify that the pair
of points were generated randomly. They describe a specific procedure for
generating random points in a provable way (via hashing some other data)
and require that the seeds that were used be saved and made available
to the verifier.
They don't say anything about why this is important, but the work by
Shumow and Ferguson now makes it clear. Otherwise there is the possibility
of a very serious back door.
So this raises the obvious question, why didn't NIST publish the seeds
that were used to generate the default points from Appendix A.1? It
seems odd that they are so insistent about using a verifiable procedure
to create points, and then they don't say whether they followed it
If they did use that procedure, NIST could simply publish the seeds for
the point generation and everyone will be able to verify that the points
are random and there is no back door.
Unfortunately there is a complication, which is that one of the pair of
points is inherited from FIPS 186-3, the Digital Signature Standard. The
EC PRNG uses the curve and base point from EC DSS. It then chooses another
point, and the two points are used for the PRNG. It's not particularly
likely that the base point from EC DSS was generated via the randomizing
technique prescribed for the EC RNG. And even if the 2nd point for the
EC RNG is in fact generated randomly and they can prove it, it would not
rule out the possibility that the base point from EC DSS had actually
been pre-selected to allow for a back door. It is crucial that both
points be generated randomly for the EC RNG to be secure.
Ironically, the EC DSS standard does publish a seed used for a
PRNG to generate the elliptic curves, so as to assure that they are
random. However based on my reading of IEEE P1363 which tells how to do
this, it does not appear that the seed constrains the base point, only
the curve parameters. Unless NIST did use a verifiably random method to
generate the base points in EC DSS and the 2nd points in EC PRNG then
there is no foundation for security.
Therefore the only reasonable way forward is for NIST to either publish
the seeds that were used for these points, if they exist, or to revise
the standard to use new points and publish the seeds for both of them.
There is no need to re-use the points from FIPS 186-3, a new pair of
points should be chosen for the PRNG via the specified randomization.

By Dave Choate
dchoate at seacoastonline.com
April 06, 2008 6:00 AM
Those who peer at children in public could find themselves on the wrong side of the law in Maine soon.
A bill that passed the House last month aims to strengthen the crime of visual sexual aggression against children, according to state Rep. Dawn Hill, D-York.
Her involvement started when Ogunquit Police Lt. David Alexander was called to a local beach to deal with a man who appeared to be observing children entering the community bathrooms. Because the state statute prevents arrests for visual sexual aggression of a child in a public place, Alexander said he and his fellow officer could only ask the man to move along.
"There was no violation of law that we could enforce. There was nothing we could charge him with," Alexander said.
He attended a talk with Hill a week later and brought the case to her attention. Hill pledged to do what she could, Alexander said, and the result was a change through the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee in the House, which made the law applicable in both private and public places.
Alexander said he's grateful Hill was willing to take up the cause, and is hopeful the measure will clear the Senate.
"I'll be pleased that we were able to identify this flaw and take steps to rectify it," he said.
Under the bill, if someone is arrested for viewing children in a public place, it would be a Class D felony if the child is between 12 to 14 years old and a Class C felony if the child is under 12, according to Hill said she believes the move was necessary to correct what she called a "loophole" in the state's criminal law statutes.
"I told Lt. Alexander that I would be happy to work with him and sponsor a bill that would correct this in the 2008 session," Hill said. "And so we did."
In arguing for the bill, Alexander said she cited public rest rooms as places where the people using them should have a reasonable expectation of privacy. She said the committee determined that there would not be any major side effects from expanding the statute to include public places.
The bill recently cleared a fiscal review, done because of the state's major prison budget crunch, and Hill said it should be heading to the Senate before long.
York Police Chief Doug Bracy said the statute would represent a fairly minor change that would help keep the public safer, especially children. He noted that York police respond fairly regularly to reports of public peepers on the town's beaches.
With ever-growing concern over sexual predators, Bracy said the arrests will also allow police to check backgrounds and determine if there is a criminal history involved.
"There is a growing outcry by the public to protect our children," Bracy said, noting that tourists from all over the country visit York.

@_subject: [med-events] - The Wonderful World of Cheney ... (fwd) 
The
Wonderful World of Cheney By Hunter / Daily Kos Cheney spoke yesterday at CPAC, the conference for people for whom reality
is just an illusion foisted upon them by a cold and liberal universe. (The
universe, you see, is full of dark matter called Librons, which in addition
to keeping the universe from flying apart like Ann Coulter in front of a
television camera, have the unfortunate side effect of inverting perceptions
of reality for all but the most trained Randian observers. Oh, and
Scientologists.) I'm supposed to say, at this point, something like "you
can't make this up", but of course you can make this stuff up. It's easy to
make it up. That's the whole point.
Some highlights
 ...
As conservatives, we believe in a government that takes up a smaller share
of the national income, that treats tax dollars with respect and restraint.
And we believe in a government that keeps to its limits under the
Constitution, never expanding beyond the consent of the governed. And then, he farted candy and rainbows. And all the little woodland
creatures came out from under the floorboards to help sew him a magnificent
new dress for the ball.
The United States is a country that takes human rights seriously. We do not
torture -- it's against our laws and against our values. We're proud of our
country and what it stands for. [...]
America is a fair and a decent country. (Applause.) President Bush has made
it clear, both publicly and privately, that our duty to uphold the laws and
standards of this nation admit no exceptions in wartime. As he put it, "We
are in a fight for our principles, and our first responsibility is, live by
them. And at that point, the Constitution Fairy sprinkled her magic Constitution
dust over the land, and all the tapes of the CIA torturing prisoners
magically erased themselves, and the waterboarded detainees became
un-waterboarded, and the vast program of illegal domestic espionage -- so
critical to our national security that President George Constitution Bush
has threatened to veto all FISA legislation, for all time, unless everyone
involved gets retroactive amnesty for their illegal acts -- suddenly became
To prevail in the long run, we have to remove the conditions that inspire
such blind, prideful hatred that drove 19 men to get into airplanes and come
kill us. And so the President made the decision: We wouldn't just remove the
Taliban and Saddam Hussein and let other dictators rise in their place. Because one of the lesser known Articles of the Constitution is that no
mention of 9/11 by an administration official may take place without a
possibly hallucinatory-drug-induced conflation of it and Saddam Hussein. And
Shrek. Shrek was also there.
I like it. Reality as practiced by a man who can't tell the difference
between a grown man standing next to him and a tiny, barely-flight-capable
bird. It's not so much a CPAC speech as it is "NAMBLA for the mind." It's a
comic book speech, delivered by a comic book man to a comic book audience.
Cheney doesn't believe in merely denying reality, he believes in pinning it
down, attaching electrodes to it, then just clubbing it to death for fun.
The thing is, it'd be easy to ascribe behavior like this to mental illness,
presuming he really believes any of the things he says. But it's not clear
he does. In all likelihood, he knows fully well how ridiculous it all
sounds, but in an audience hand-picked for their willingness to accept any
premise, no matter how ridiculous, in order to feel good about their own
bigotries, nobody will ever call him out on it.
It's interesting, because once again one would think it would be a key
component of rational public discourse for people to, indeed, call him out
on his happy, camouflage-colored delusions. But it's somehow off-limits, in
the press, to point out when a public official is an unmitigated,
reality-sodomizing liar. Haircuts and pantsuits: fair game. Pointing out
that "a smaller share of the national income" means "a larger share", that
"restrained" spending means "more" spending, that "keeping to the limits of
the Constitution" means breaking those limits, that "no torture" means
"torture", and that "9/11" means anything else he wants it to mean at any
moment in time: pointing those things out are uncouth activities to be
delegated to people like Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Keith Olbermann, and
a handful of crazy, uncivilized blogs.
And we're reduced to just making fun of it, because really -- what else are
you going to do? How do you refute something that's self-refuting?
Go figure.

Um, thats *five* cuts.  And not random cuts either - they are specifically targetting both sides of the rings.  This is someone who truly understands the tech - they are not just cutting random cables, they are cutting the right cables in the right sequence.
I have been having an offline talk with a small group since this started, and none of us believed it was "random" after cut  and I am pretty certain everyone of us believes it's a pro.
The question is *who*?  The parche is in fact decomm'd (one of the group checked on it's pyhsical status); and there are only two countries suspected of having the required type of sub (Israel and Russia) besides the US.  I would have thought Israel but for the heavy targetting of French property, and I cant find any reason for it to be Russia other than there is nobody else.  Of course, I dont see what the various spook facilities do, so who knows, maybe everyone has sea-floor open to the water cable subs docking these days?

Yeah, I'm top osting: it's 2am and I'm dead - sue me.
Having been ana active "operator" of undersea cables, I can assure you that they do occasionally break (boat anchors, floor movements, etc.), but only very, very rarely.  To suggest that a break is not something unusual enough for even the operators to discount until every other possible thing has been checked si just plain false.  In the 4 years I had direct, personal access to systems controlling & monitoring several undersea cables, I have never seen one cut or otherwise fatally damaged.  I have seen a single leak which took out a few fibers, and required about 5 weeks to get a ship to repair.
That these can be discounted as anything but planned and coordinated acts is impossible.

This is clear BS as well, and tells me all I need to know about the author.  No, they dont leak RF, they leak photons when bent.  And, rumor says there are other nifty things you can do.  I have personally tapped a fiber optic cable (above sea level) in the lab, just for shits and giggles, and its not hard.

On land, yes.  At sea?  To be honest, I never really considered it...  Thinking about it though, my guess would be no.  I base that on several (a) The location of the break is determined via OTDR.  How can you know where your reflection originates if you have regen stations?
(b) Power requirements are very significant at regens: where does all this happy juice come from at the floor of the sea?
(c) Regen stations would introduce elevated failure rates that are not seen (by me.  YMMV).
I find this hard to buy into for all of the above, *plus* the difficulty of shoving multiple fibers through such an inductive device.  I simply dont believe it possible.
Exactly.  Even if they try to multiplex on top of themselves, there just no way.
As has been pointed out by many (even myself I think), these breaks are clearly an organized event, but of unknown purpose.  as was astutely pointed out, the guys who would want to do the cutting are separate from and antithetical to, the guys who want to do the monitoring.  Also, the guys who want to do the monitoring dont need to be breaking cables to do it - they bring out the Jimmy Carter (now that her sister is truly mothballed) and they do it in a nice dry lab on the ocean floor, with a good cup of hot coffe fresh from nuclear irradiation (er, "heating").
I see no point to these acts, but neither can I deny that these acts *must* have been deliberate.  And I do not pretend to know what everyone else could possibly be considering as motives.  I do particularly like the hypothesis put forward about testing the responses of places nobody otherwise cares about, but thats just the shit disturber in me, I'm sure J.A. Terranson

At the end of 2004, my annual key expiration event was allowed to pass without genning a new key: nobody had sent me encrypted mail in ages [years], and being the prick that I am, I started a little game instead.
I left the expired key on the .sig, and started the clock to see how long it would take for someone to notice. January 1, 2005 through February 25, 2008: about 3 years.  I had fully expected a CP to be the lucky contestent, but alas, Cpunks dont bother with key management anymore - heck, we dont even bother with distributed email anymore AFAIK.  Alas, the alert correspondent was a commercial software vendor who makes little widgets.  I had made an inquiry about a mass purchase, and they noticed the [now profoundly] expired key, and decided to Do The Right Thing and encrypt.  Only they couldn't, as the key was deader than dead: it was "Tim May Someone Needs Killing Dead".  And, even better, they were nice enough to point it out, assuming I was unaware.  I am BCC'ing this post to said vendor: you really did do The Right Thing, and I applaud you for it!  That you are the only one to notice is, I hope, a sign of the attention to detail I will find in your widgets.
So, CP Distributed Lists are dead.  The list, singular is tottering, and has been for years, and now, I think I can proclaim Encryption Everywhere as Dead On Arrival.  Even for so called crypto people.  Tis a sad day in Eurasia folks.

Express Scripts, the pharmacy benefits management company which recently disclosed an extortionist is demanding money by threatening to expose millions of patient records the company holds, Wednesday said it has decided to offer $1 million to nab the perpetrator.
.We.re going on the offense with this reward,. says Steve Littlejohn, Express Scripts spokesman and vice president of public affairs. The $1 million will be paid to anyone who provides information leading to the capture and conviction of the extortionist who sent a letter to Express Scripts in early October that contained personal information on 75 people, considered members, who use the company.s pharmacy-benefits services. The extortionist claims to have information on millions more Express Scripts members and wants money to not reveal it.
Express Scripts has refused to cave in to the extortionist.s demand. But Littlejohn said that now a small number of its clients, such as companies offering healthcare plans to employees, are also now receiving extortion threats with personal information about members. .The letters are similar enough that we are inclined to think it.s the same person,. says He says Express Scripts and its clients are agreeing not cave in to the extortionist.s demand for money.

To demonstrate the misuse of the Web may be journalists, one student
added to the page dedicated to Maurice Jarre words invented. A quote
taken daily by many Anglo-Saxons.
This is a quote that was found in the columns of newspapers and blogs
of the Anglo-Saxon world. At the end of March, passing of french
musician Maurice Jarre, several English newspapers like The Guardian
and The Independent London, but also prestigious Indian and Australian
newspapers, in their obituaries quote "poetics" thoughts of the
artist: "I could say that my life itself was a soundtrack. Music was
my life, music gave me life, and music is what I will be remembered
long after I leave this life. When I die, there will be a last waltz
playing in my head, only I can hear. " Problem, this sentence was
never written nor uttered by the composer, who died at the age of 84
after a battle with cancer.
It comes from the imagination of Shane Fitzgerald, a young man of 22
years studying the sociology and economics at University College
Dublin. The Irish student revealed Wednesday to have fooled the press
by publishing false citations on Wikipedia.
In search of a topic for his presentation of the course on
globalization, the student decides to show how journalists are
dependent on information circulating on the Internet, doing a little
experiment on Wikipedia, "accessed by many journalists. " Shortly
after the death of the composer of "Lawrence of Arabia", he published
on the English version of the online encyclopedia that famous quote.
Wikipedia was suspicious, for he did not quote sources, and removed
it. But determined, Shane Fitzgerald posts again. In his third
attempt, the apocryphal statement escapes the vigilance of the
moderators and remains twenty-five hours in line. Enough to be copied,
 particularly by The Guardian, The London Independent, BBC Music
Magazine and the Daily Mail.
Ethical qualms
This success has exceeded all expectations Shane. "I did not expect
that it goes so far. I expected that it can be found on blogs or
sites, but not on quality newspapers, "he told the Irish Times. But
the young man confides to have asked questions about the ethics of
such an approach. "Had I the right to use the death of someone to
perform this social experiment? But when I learned that on TV his
passing, I knew I had a good story, a news piece on which journalists
would be under pressure to write quickly. So I tried to find a phrase
that would not harm the reputation of Maurice Jarre, "said he.
To the great surprise of the student, who finally changed the topic of
presentation, the weeks passed and the newspaper are aware of nothing.
Shane decided to reveal by e-mail his trickery. The Daily Mail and BBC
Music Magazine has since withdrawn the subpoena, which remains visible
at many sites. The Guardian has not only published an erratum, but
also an article on this subject.
"The timing for Shane to upload his hoax could not be better. Shane
changed the Wikipedia page of Maurice Jarre in the night, hours after
the announcement of his death [23 hours proved to Paris time on Sunday
29 March]. We gave the topic the next morning to a journalist who had
only a few hours to write my paper, "said the daily. "What is worrying
is that have discovered the pot aux roses (uncovered ze mystuhry)
because the author of this farce came out on his own" "However, the
moral of the story is not that journalists should stop looking at
Wikipedia, but they should not duplicate information that they can not
trace the origin," says The Guardian, who regrets that Shane
Fitzgerald had waited a month before revealing the truth.

Please note that I have crossposted a copy of this to cypherpunks, since they appear to have been the primary "beneficiaries" of these phantasmagorical "subscriptions", as well as Spam-L where this is a topic of discussion due to the errant "subscriptions" that materialized out of thin air for so many people today.  I invite you to come on down to spam-l (  ) if you would like to remove the high piched rhetoric I have quoted etensively below, and discuss ways to prevent another disaster like you had today with this "reconstruction".
Since i have been unsubbed, I was unaware of most of this attack material: it was sent to me by someone still subscribed: I am answering it regardless of my subscription status as I don't take well to being called a liar, publicly or otherwise.  I am truly curious if you have the moral fortitude to allow your listmembers to see this reply.
Regardless of how well or how long you may have known Earl, it is an absolute *fact* that he he added people who were not subscribers.  Many of the addresses he restored included NON-subscribers who had crossposts from either cypherpunks or burning man lists.  The most likely reason for this is he lost his list and went back through the archives and added every "From:" address /she saw in an attempt to recover it. Warning Will Robinson:  "From:" does not equal subscribed - Earl made a *huge* error here, and is now compounding it by asserting that the error is on the newly mass-subscribed to prove that they were never really subscribers in the first place.
Good for Earl.  He did it *right*, way back when it wasn't fashionable.  The only problem is that (1) this is not 1994, (2) he doesnt HAVE that original list, so he's trying to "recover it" by scraping "From:" entries in archives, and (3) Earl even admitted himself that
that tells us that he KNEW his list was inaccurate when he did it.  Add to this already incredible clusterfsck the fact that his list appears to have been gone for *years*, and that Earl clearly admits that he hasnt a clue who was and was not actually subscribed:
The proper way to do this, if you *must*, is to ask for re-subscriptions (see below), NOT to just force people onto your list and then put the onus on them to get off.
Earl was at least honest that he wasnt totally sure he knew what he was doing.  You on the other hand have absolutely *zero* doubts that you and Earl are *always* right and that your subscribers (both voluntary and forced) are *always* wrong:
This is beyond merely ignorant (as in 'without sufficient knowledge of your topic' to argue any point successfully), it is also arrogant and wrong headed.  Just because Earl had a COI list in 1994 (and maybe even in 2005?), doesnt mean he can just add people who havent heard from that list in YEARS.
Still, despite a large number of simultaneous complaints, you continue:
The problem with this argument is it is specious: not a single one of the persons complaining they are not subscribers subscribed "the day before", or even the YEAR before.  Since you've already called each and every person who complained a liar, including me, SHOW ME THE MONEY.  Lets see that COI I sent in, whether it was in 1994 or 2009.  No record?  No You continue:
EVIDENCE? Did you say you had *evidence*???  Lets see it. SHOW ME THE COI!
While your list administrator is most certainly "hapless", the complaints I have seen have NOT accused him/her of but of merely lacking enough skill to run the mailing list according to accepted and acceptable practices (which conveniently also stop complaints about spam.  Gee.  Imagine that?)
You are making some pretty extreme statements about the motives of people you dont know - probably because they were never on your list to interact with in the first place - for the very reason you complain that the spamees are:
According to your own administrators statements and archives, he is trying to reconstruct a list that has been dead for *years*.  At the point where you lose your list and fail to send mail for a reasonable period of time (open to debate, generally considered at *least* annually, plus occasional reminders of the subscription), you have lost your *consent* to mail to those people.
None of those formerly subscribed people are now subscribers, because by losing the list you have unsubscribed them.  Of course, this only covers those names that may *actually* have been [COI] subscribers: the people that were scraped into your broken list and expected to
have zero reason to want to help you out by helping you clean your list.  Why should they: you just spammed them all, and followed it up with a rant calling them all lazy, stupid, liars!
Next time Earl or you tries this, at least try and skirt the edge: send out an email to those people you think may have been subscribers, and explain what happened:
reconnect with everyone, but we are not certain that all of the name we have were actual listmembers.  If we sent you this by accident, we apologize - you will not hear from us again, and you need do nothing for that to happen.  If on the otherhand you were a listmember, or would like to become one now, please respond to this email, GIVING US PERMISSION TO SEND TO YOU."
What you and your friend just did is no different than Gevalia, Amex, or Wallace himself.  Your arrogant "You ARE a subscriber, or you WERE one, because WE SAID SO" attitude makes you a defacto spammer, eligible for block on sight.

Even 40 years behind you!), as well as lifetime punishments that are unexpected: no more fair access to the courts (any case filed against you, no matter how off the wall or just plain crazy will succeed, and any case you file, no matter how locked-in and unquestionable, will be dismissed at your costs); little to no protection from the police (but plenty of harassment); extreme difficulty in finding housing; a permanent loss of basic rights to self defense (this one I *really* don't get, at least for non-violent offenders - of course, if you've punched that ticket, you're *obviously* violent, right?); the loss of you pretense at picking your leader (no loss there), etc.

By Jeremy Pelofsky
WASHINGTON | Wed Dec 1, 2010 7:28pm EST
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has stopped hosting WikiLeaks' website after an inquiry by the U.S. Senate Homeland Security Committee amid anger about the release of classified U.S. government documents on the site.
WikiLeaks turned to Amazon to keep its site available after hackers tried to flood it and thus prevent users from accessing the classified information posted. WikiLeaks said Wednesday it was now being hosted by servers in Europe.
Staff for Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman had questioned Amazon about its relationship with WikiLeaks Tuesday and called on other companies that provide web-hosting services to boycott WikiLeaks.
"I wish that Amazon had taken this action earlier based on WikiLeaks' previous publication of classified material," Lieberman, an independent, said in a statement. "I call on any other company or organization that is hosting WikiLeaks to immediately terminate its relationship with them."
WikiLeaks has said since Sunday, when the first of its latest cache of U.S. government documents were published by media outlets, that its site was the target of a "distributed denial of service" attack, which is a computer attack meant to overwhelm a website and render it unavailable.
A representative for Amazon, which is widely known for its Internet retail business but also offers smaller Internet-hosting services, did not respond to requests for comment.
WikiLeaks slammed Amazon for dropping it, saying via the social media network Twitter that if Amazon was "so uncomfortable with the First Amendment (of the U.S. Constitution), they should get out of the business of selling books."
WikiLeaks obtained scores of internal U.S. State Department communications, some of which were classified and included candid and embarrassing assessments of world leaders, and released them via media outlets and its own website.
Earlier this year, the website also released thousands of U.S. classified documents related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, drawing condemnations that the information could endanger U.S. forces and those helping the war efforts there.
The U.S. Justice Department and Defense Department are investigating how the treasure trove of documents wound up in WikiLeaks hands. The prime suspect has been a former U.S. Army intelligence analyst, Bradley Manning.
Even though Amazon has stopped providing the web-hosting services to WikiLeaks, Lieberman suggested that his problem with the company was not fully resolved.
"I will be asking Amazon about the extent of its relationship with Wikileaks and what it and other web service providers will do in the future to ensure that their services are not used to distribute stolen, classified information," Lieberman said.
Ryan Calo, a lecturer at Stanford University's Center for Internet and Society, said that under U.S. law, Amazon would likely have been shielded from any possible prosecution by the government over the WikiLeaks document dump.
"It would set a dangerous precedent were companies like Amazon to take down things merely because the senator or another government entity started to ask question about them," Calo said.

State Pulls the Plug On SIPRNet
November 29, 2010 at 9:26 pm
Late last week, after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton informed the White House of the likely fall-out from the WikiLeaks cable dump, the White House came back with a question: What's our corrective action?
Clinton's undersecretary for management, Patrick Kennedy, had a simple suggestion: pull the plug on SIPRNet [1], the classified DoD network that PFC Bradley Manning reportedly used to download the cables from State's inhouse classified database. The White House said do it, says a senior administration official.
The publication by WikiLeaks of more than 250,000 diplomatic cables, many of them classified, is forcing an administration-wide intelligence retrenchment as agencies reconsider how to balance the need to share with the need to know. With its third major dump of controversial classified information in nine months, WikiLeaks is single-handedly tipping the balance back towards inter-agency "stovepiping", or walling off information from other departments.
Post 9.11 the imperative from Congress and the White House was to break down the stovepipes that prevented sharing across the so-called intelligence communitythe sprawling collection of intelligence offices in more than a dozen different agencies across the U.S. government and around the world.
At State, they created the Net-Centric Diplomacy" database or NCD, where State stored classified information up to the top secret level. Agencies across government had access to that database through their own secure networks. In DoD's case the network, created in 1995, was called the Secure Internet Protocol Router Network, or SIPRNet.
Late last week, at Kennedy's recommendation and the White House's approval, State disconnected SIPRNet from the NCD, senior administration officials tell Time. Obviously there were some gaps within SIPRNet that DoD is actively correcting, the senior administration official says, And as a temporary precaution we have disconnected SIPRNet from the NCD.
How long is temporary? DoD is investigating how Manning managed to download all those cables and get them to WikiLeaks, the senior administration officials tell Time. So far they have concluded that the failure came at Dod's Central Command, the combatant command responsible for the middle east, which employed Manning in Iraq. Prior to Manning's download, users of SIPRNet had been blocked from downloading data to removable media.
But at some point that restriction was lifted across all of CentCom. DoD has been reimposing restrictions since the July dump of Afghanistan war documents by WikiLeaks. DoD has blocked the use of removable media; they have required in some cases a dual key system that requires a second user to approve moving data from a higher classification system to a lower classification system; and they are installing software programs to monitor unusual activity.
DoD is not completely cut off from State's database. A separate system for the transmission of top secret information, the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System or JWICS [2], is still linked to the NCD. And State may reconnect SIPRNet in the future. Once DoD has gone through and made its corrections on SIPRNet we'll reevaluate whether to reconnect, the senior administration official says.

Hundreds of WikiLeaks Mirror Sites Appear
By RAVI SOMAIYA
Published: December 5, 2010
LONDON . The battle lines between supporters of the whistle-blowing Web site WikiLeaks and its detractors began to form on Sunday, as supporters erected numerous copies of the site on the Internet and the United States put pressure on Switzerland not to offer a haven to the site.s founder, Julian Assange.
Since several major Internet companies cut off services to WikiLeaks in recent days, activists have created hundreds of mirror sites, Web sites that host exact copies of another site.s content, making censorship The collective Anonymous, an informal but notorious group of hackers and activists, also declared war on Sunday against enemies of Mr. Assange, calling on supporters to attack sites companies that do not support WikiLeaks and to spread the leaked material online.
Meanwhile, the American ambassador to Switzerland, Donald S. Beyer Jr., responded to signs that Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks might seek refuge in that country, warning in the weekly magazine NZZ am Sonntag that the Swiss .should very carefully consider whether to provide shelter to someone who is on the run from the law..
Since the release of classified diplomatic cables a week ago, from a batch of more than 250,000 obtained by WikiLeaks, the Web site has been bombarded by cyberattacks and abandoned by Internet companies like PayPal, an online payment service that had accepted donations for the site, and Amazon, which had rented it server space.
WikiLeaks said that PayPal had .surrendered to U.S. government pressure,. but the government has not acknowledged involvement in efforts to try to disable the site.
On Friday, WikiLeaks sought refuge in a diffuse web of financial and Internet infrastructure spread across Europe, particularly in Switzerland. It moved to wikileaks.ch, a domain registered to the Swiss Pirate Party, a political organization that shares many of Mr. Assange.s aims.
A Swiss-Icelandic company, Datacell, will process donations instead of PayPal, and the WikiLeaks site shows that Mr. Assange is accepting direct donations into a Swiss bank account held with the financial arm of the Swiss postal service.
But that solace may be short lived: a spokesman for the financial arm of Swiss Post, Marc Andrey, also told NZZ am Sonntag on Sunday that it was .reviewing. its relationship with Mr. Assange subject to proof that he has Swiss residency, owns property or does business in the country. A message seeking comment from Mr. Assange.s British lawyer was not immediately The Internet group Anonymous, which in the past has taken on targets as diverse as the Church of Scientology and Iran, disseminated a seven-point manifesto via Twitter and other social networking sites pledging to .kick back for Julian..
Gregg Housh, a prominent member of the group, said by telephone from Boston that an orchestrated effort was under way to attack companies that have refused to support WikiLeaks and to post multiple copies of the leaked material.
The Anonymous manifesto singled out PayPal, which cut off ties with WikiLeaks for .a violation. of its policy on promoting illegal activities, a company statement said.
.The reason is amazingly simple,. Mr. Housh said of the campaign. .We all believe that information should be free, and the Internet should be free..
By late Sunday, there were at least 208 WikiLeaks mirror sites up and .Cut us down,. said a message on the WikiLeaks Twitter feed on Sunday, .and the stronger we become..

Monitoring America
Monday, December 20, 2010; 1:40 AM
Nine years after the terrorist attacks of 2001, the United States is assembling a vast domestic intelligence apparatus to collect information about Americans, using the FBI, local police, state homeland security offices and military criminal investigators.
The system, by far the largest and most technologically sophisticated in the nation's history, collects, stores and analyzes information about thousands of U.S. citizens and residents, many of whom have not been accused of any wrongdoing.
The government's goal is to have every state and local law enforcement agency in the country feed information to Washington to buttress the work of the FBI, which is in charge of terrorism investigations in the United Other democracies - Britain and Israel, to name two - are well acquainted with such domestic security measures. But for the United States, the sum of these new activities represents a new level of governmental scrutiny.
This localized intelligence apparatus is part of a larger Top Secret America created since the attacks. In July, The Washington Post described an alternative geography of the United States, one that has grown so large, unwieldy and secretive that no one knows how much money it costs, how many people it employs or how many programs exist within it.
Today's story, along with related material on The Post's Web site, examines how Top Secret America plays out at the local level. It describes a web of 4,058 federal, state and local organizations, each with its own counterterrorism responsibilities and jurisdictions. At least 935 of these organizations have been created since the 2001 attacks or became involved in counterterrorism for the first time after 9/11.
The months-long investigation, based on nearly 100 interviews and 1,000 documents, found that:
* Technologies and techniques honed for use on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan have migrated into the hands of law enforcement agencies in America.
* The FBI is building a database with the names and certain personal information, such as employment history, of thousands of U.S. citizens and residents whom a local police officer or a fellow citizen believed to be acting suspiciously. It is accessible to an increasing number of local law enforcement and military criminal investigators, increasing concerns that it could somehow end up in the public domain.
* Seeking to learn more about Islam and terrorism, some law enforcement agencies have hired as trainers self-described experts whose extremist views on Islam and terrorism are considered inaccurate and counterproductive by the FBI and U.S. intelligence agencies.
* The Department of Homeland Security sends its state and local partners intelligence reports with little meaningful guidance, and state reports have sometimes inappropriately reported on lawful meetings.
Job fair
Counterterrorism on Main Street
In cities across Tennessee and across the nation local agencies are using sophisticated equipment and techniques to keep an eye out for terrorist threats -- and to watch Americans in the process. Launch Gallery ;
The need to identify U.S.-born or naturalized citizens who are planning violent attacks is more urgent than ever, U.S. intelligence officials say. This month's FBI sting operation involving a Baltimore construction worker who allegedly planned to bomb a Maryland military recruiting station is the latest example. It followed a similar arrest of a Somali-born naturalized U.S. citizen allegedly seeking to detonate a bomb near a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, Ore. There have been nearly two dozen other cases just this year.
"The old view that 'if we fight the terrorists abroad, we won't have to fight them here' is just that - the old view," Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told police and firefighters recently.
The Obama administration heralds this local approach as a much-needed evolution in the way the country confronts terrorism.
Top Secret America is a project two years in the making that describes the huge security buildup in the United States after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Today.s story is about those efforts at the local level, including law enforcement and homeland security agencies in every state and thousands of communities. View previous stories, explore relationships between government organizations and the types of work being done, and view top-secret geography on an interactive map.
However, just as at the federal level, the effectiveness of these programs, as well as their cost, is difficult to determine. The Department of Homeland Security, for example, does not know how much money it spends each year on what are known as state fusion centers, which bring together and analyze information from various agencies within a state.
The total cost of the localized system is also hard to gauge. The DHS has given $31 billion in grants since 2003 to state and local governments for homeland security and to improve their ability to find and protect against terrorists, including $3.8 billion in 2010. At least four other federal departments also contribute to local efforts. But the bulk of the spending every year comes from state and local budgets that are too disparately recorded to aggregate into an overall total.
The Post findings paint a picture of a country at a crossroads, where long-standing privacy principles are under challenge by these new efforts to keep the nation safe.
The public face of this pivotal effort is Napolitano, the former governor of Arizona, which years ago built one of the strongest state intelligence organizations outside of New York to try to stop illegal immigration and drug importation.
Napolitano has taken her "See Something, Say Something" campaign far beyond the traffic signs that ask drivers coming into the nation's capital for "Terror Tips" and to "Report Suspicious Activity."
She recently enlisted the help of Wal-Mart, Amtrak, major sports leagues, hotel chains and metro riders. In her speeches, she compares the undertaking to the Cold War fight against communists.
"This represents a shift for our country," she told New York City police officers and firefighters on the eve of the 9/11 anniversary this fall. "In a sense, this harkens back to when we drew on the tradition of civil defense and preparedness that predated today's concerns."
On a recent night in Memphis, a patrol car rolled slowly through a parking lot in a run-down section of town. The military-grade infrared camera on its hood moved robotically from left to right, snapping digital images of one license plate after another and analyzing each almost instantly.
Suddenly, a red light flashed on the car's screen along with the word "Got a live one! Let's do it," an officer called out.
The streets of Memphis are a world away from the streets of Kabul, yet these days, the same types of technologies and techniques are being used in both places to identify and collect information about suspected criminals and terrorists.
The examples go far beyond Memphis.
* Hand-held, wireless fingerprint scanners were carried by U.S. troops during the insurgency in Iraq to register residents of entire neighborhoods. L-1 Identity Solutions is selling the same type of equipment to police departments to check motorists' identities.
* In Arizona, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Facial Recognition Unit, using a type of equipment prevalent in war zones, records 9,000 biometric digital mug shots a month.
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection flies General Atomics' Predator drones along the Mexican and Canadian borders - the same kind of aircraft, equipped with real-time, full-motion video cameras, that has been used in wars in Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan to track the enemy.
The special operations units deployed overseas to kill the al-Qaeda leadership drove technological advances that are now expanding in use across the United States. On the front lines, those advances allowed the rapid fusing of biometric identification, captured computer records and cellphone numbers so troops could launch the next surprise raid.
Here at home, it's the DHS that is enamored with collecting photos, video images and other personal information about U.S. residents in the hopes of teasing out terrorists.
The DHS helped Memphis buy surveillance cameras that monitor residents near high-crime housing projects, problematic street corners, and bridges and other critical infrastructure. It helped pay for license plate readers and defrayed some of the cost of setting up Memphis's crime-analysis center. All together it has given Memphis $11 million since 2003 in homeland security grants, most of which the city has used to fight crime.
"We have got things now we didn't have before," said Memphis Police Department Director Larry Godwin, who has produced record numbers of arrests using all this new analysis and technology. "Some of them we can talk about. Some of them we can't."
One of the biggest advocates of Memphis's data revolution is John Harvey, the police department's technology specialist, whose computer systems are the civilian equivalent of the fancier special ops equipment used by the Harvey collects any information he can pry out of government and industry. When officers were wasting time knocking on the wrong doors to serve warrants, he persuaded the local utility company to give him a daily update of the names and addresses of customers.
When he wanted more information about phones captured at crime scenes, he programmed a way to store all emergency 911 calls, which often include names and addresses to associate with phone numbers. He created another program to upload new crime reports every five minutes and mine them for the phone numbers of victims, suspects, witnesses and anyone else listed on them.
Now, instead of having to decide which license plate numbers to type into a computer console in the patrol car, an officer can simply drive around, and the automatic license plate reader on his hood captures the numbers on every vehicle nearby. If the officer pulls over a driver, instead of having to wait 20 minutes for someone back at the office to manually check records, he can use a hand-held device to instantly call up a mug shot, a Social Security number, the status of the driver's license and any outstanding warrants.
The computer in the cruiser can tell an officer even more about who owns the vehicle, the owner's name and address and criminal history, and who else with a criminal history might live at the same address.
Take a recent case of two officers with the hood-mounted camera equipment who stopped a man driving on a suspended license. One handcuffed him, and the other checked his own PDA. Based on the information that came up, the man was ordered downtown to pay a fine and released as the officers drove off to stop another car.
That wasn't the end of it, though.
A record of that stop - and the details of every other arrest made that night, and every summons written - was automatically transferred to the Memphis Real Time Crime Center, a command center with three walls of streaming surveillance video and analysis capabilities that rival those of an Army command center.
There, the information would be geocoded on a map to produce a visual rendering of crime patterns. This information would help the crime intelligence analysts predict trends so the department could figure out what neighborhoods to swarm with officers and surveillance cameras.
But that was still not the end of it, because the fingerprints from the crime records would also go to the FBI's data campus in Clarksburg, W.Va. There, fingerprints from across the United States are stored, along with others collected by American authorities from prisoners in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, Iraq and Afghanistan.
There are 96 million sets of fingerprints in Clarksburg, a volume that government officials view not as daunting but as an opportunity.
This year for the first time, the FBI, the DHS and the Defense Department are able to search each other's fingerprint databases, said Myra Gray, head of the Defense Department's Biometrics Identity Management Agency, speaking to an industry group recently. "Hopefully in the not-too-distant future," she said, "our relationship with these federal agencies - along with state and local agencies - will be completely symbiotic."
The FBI's 'suspicious' files
At the same time that the FBI is expanding its West Virginia database, it is building a vast repository controlled by people who work in a top-secret vault on the fourth floor of the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building in Washington. This one stores the profiles of tens of thousands of Americans and legal residents who are not accused of any crime. What they have done is appear to be acting suspiciously to a town sheriff, a traffic cop or even a neighbor.
If the new Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative, or SAR, works as intended, the Guardian database may someday hold files forwarded by all police departments across the country in America's continuing search for terrorists within its borders.
The effectiveness of this database depends, in fact, on collecting the identities of people who are not known criminals or terrorists - and on being able to quickly compile in-depth profiles of them.
"If we want to get to the point where we connect the dots, the dots have to be there," said Richard A. McFeely, special agent in charge of the FBI's Baltimore office.
In response to concerns that information in the database could be improperly used or released, FBI officials say anyone with access has been trained in privacy rules and the penalties for breaking them.
But not everyone is convinced. "It opens a door for all kinds of abuses," said Michael German, a former FBI agent who now leads the American Civil Liberties Union's campaign on national security and privacy matters. "How do we know there are enough controls?"
The government defines a suspicious activity as "observed behavior reasonably indicative of pre-operational planning related to terrorism or other criminal activity" related to terrorism.
State intelligence analysts and FBI investigators use the reports to determine whether a person is buying fertilizer to make a bomb or to plant tomatoes; whether she is plotting to poison a city's drinking water or studying for a metallurgy test; whether, as happened on a Sunday morning in late September, the man snapping a picture of a ferry in the Newport Beach harbor in Southern California simply liked the way it looked or was plotting to blow it up.
Suspicious Activity Report N03821 says a local law enforcement officer observed "a suspicious subject . . . taking photographs of the Orange County Sheriff Department Fire Boat and the Balboa Ferry with a cellular phone camera." The confidential report, marked "For Official Use Only," noted that the subject next made a phone call, walked to his car and returned five minutes later to take more pictures. He was then met by another person, both of whom stood and "observed the boat traffic in the harbor." Next another adult with two small children joined them, and then they all boarded the ferry and crossed the channel.
All of this information was forwarded to the Los Angeles fusion center for further investigation after the local officer ran information about the vehicle and its owner through several crime databases and found nothing.
Authorities would not say what happened to it from there, but there are several paths a suspicious activity report can take:
At the fusion center, an officer would decide to either dismiss the suspicious activity as harmless or forward the report to the nearest FBI terrorism unit for further investigation.
At that unit, it would immediately be entered into the Guardian database, at which point one of three things could happen:
The FBI could collect more information, find no connection to terrorism and mark the file closed, though leaving it in the database.
It could find a possible connection and turn it into a full-fledged case.
Or, as most often happens, it could make no specific determination, which would mean that Suspicious Activity Report N03821 would sit in limbo for as long as five years, during which time many other pieces of information about the man photographing a boat on a Sunday morning could be added to his file: employment, financial and residential histories; multiple phone numbers; audio files; video from the dashboard-mounted camera in the police cruiser at the harbor where he took pictures; and anything else in government or commercial databases "that adds value," as the FBI agent in charge of the database described it.
That could soon include biometric data, if it existed; the FBI is working on a way to attach such information to files. Meanwhile, the bureau will also soon have software that allows local agencies to map all suspicious incidents in their jurisdiction.
The Defense Department is also interested in the database. It recently transferred 100 reports of suspicious behavior into the Guardian system, and over time it expects to add thousands more as it connects 8,000 military law enforcement personnel to an FBI portal that will allow them to send and review reports about people suspected of casing U.S. bases or targeting American personnel.
And the DHS has created a separate way for state and local authorities, private citizens, and businesses to submit suspicious activity reports to the FBI and to the department for analysis.
As of December, there were 161,948 suspicious activity files in the classified Guardian database, mostly leads from FBI headquarters and state field offices. Two years ago, the bureau set up an unclassified section of the database so state and local agencies could send in suspicious incident reports and review those submitted by their counterparts in other states. Some 890 state and local agencies have sent in 7,197 reports so far.
Of those, 103 have become full investigations that have resulted in at least five arrests, the FBI said. There have been no convictions yet. An additional 365 reports have added information to ongoing cases.
But most remain in the uncertain middle, which is why within the FBI and other intelligence agencies there is much debate about the effectiveness of the bottom-up SAR approach, as well as concern over the privacy implications of retaining so much information on U.S. citizens and residents who have not been charged with anything.
The vast majority of terrorism leads in the United States originate from confidential FBI sources and from the bureau's collaboration with federal intelligence agencies, which mainly work overseas. Occasionally a stop by a local police officer has sparked an investigation. Evidence comes from targeted FBI surveillance and undercover operations, not from information and analysis generated by state fusion centers about people acting "It's really resource-inefficient," said Philip Mudd, a 20-year CIA counterterrorism expert and a top FBI national security official until he retired nine months ago. "If I were to have a dialogue with the country about this . . . it would be about not only how we chase the unknowns, but do you want to do suspicious activity reports across the country? . . . Anyone who is not at least suspected of doing something criminal should not be in a database."
Charles Allen, a longtime senior CIA official who then led the DHS's intelligence office until 2009, said some senior people in the intelligence community are skeptical that SARs are an effective way to find terrorists. "It's more likely that other kinds of more focused efforts by local police will gain you the information that you need about extremist activities," he said.
The DHS can point to some successes: Last year the Colorado fusion center turned up information on Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan-born U.S. resident planning to bomb the New York subway system. In 2007, a Florida fusion center provided the vehicle ownership history used to identify and arrest an Egyptian student who later pleaded guilty to providing material support to terrorism, in this case transporting explosives.
"Ninety-nine percent doesn't pan out or lead to anything" said Richard Lambert Jr., the special agent in charge of the FBI's Knoxville office. "But we're happy to wade through these things."
Expert training?
Ramon Montijo has taught classes on terrorism and Islam to law enforcement officers all over the country.
"Alabama, Colorado, Vermont," said Montijo, a former Army Special Forces sergeant and Los Angeles Police Department investigator who is now a private security consultant. "California, Texas and Missouri," he What he tells them is always the same, he said: Most Muslims in the United States want to impose sharia law here.
"They want to make this world Islamic. The Islamic flag will fly over the White House - not on my watch!" he said. "My job is to wake up the public, and first, the first responders."
With so many local agencies around the country being asked to help catch terrorists, it often falls to sheriffs or state troopers to try to understand the world of terrorism. They aren't FBI agents, who have years of on-the-job and classroom training.
Instead, they are often people like Lacy Craig, who was a police dispatcher before she became an intelligence analyst at Idaho's fusion center, or the detectives in Minnesota, Michigan and Arkansas who can talk at length about the lineage of gangs or the signs of a crystal meth Now each of them is a go-to person on terrorism as well.
"The CIA used to train analysts forever before they graduated to be a real analyst," said Allen, the former top CIA and DHS official. "Today we take former law enforcement officers and we call them intelligence officers, and that's not right, because they have not received any training on intelligence analysis."
State fusion center officials say their analysts are getting better with time. "There was a time when law enforcement didn't know much about drugs. This is no different," said Steven W. Hewitt, who runs the Tennessee fusion center, considered one of the best in the country. "Are we experts at the level of [the National Counterterrorism Center]? No. Are we developing an expertise? Absolutely."
But how they do that is usually left up to the local police departments themselves. In their desire to learn more about terrorism, many departments are hiring their own trainers. Some are self-described experts whose extremist views are considered inaccurate and harmful by the FBI and others in the intelligence community
Like Montijo, Walid Shoebat, a onetime Muslim who converted to Christianity, also lectures to local police. He too believes that most Muslims seek to impose sharia law in the United States. To prevent this, he said in an interview, he warns officers that "you need to look at the entire pool of Muslims in a community."
When Shoebat spoke to the first annual South Dakota Fusion Center Conference in Sioux Falls this June, he told them to monitor Muslim student groups and local mosques and, if possible, tap their phones. "You can find out a lot of information that way," he said.
A book expanding on what Shoebat and Montijo believe has just been published by the Center for Security Policy, a Washington-based neoconservative think tank. "Shariah: The Threat to America" describes what its authors call a "stealth jihad" that must be thwarted before it's too late.
The book's co-authors include such notables as former CIA director R. James Woolsey and former deputy undersecretary of defense for intelligence Lt. Gen. William G. Boykin, along with the center's director, a longtime activist. They write that most mosques in the United States already have been radicalized, that most Muslim social organizations are fronts for violent jihadists and that Muslims who practice sharia law seek to impose it in this country.
Frank Gaffney Jr., director of the center, said his team has spoken widely, including to many law enforcement forums.
"Members of our team have been involved in training programs for several years now, many of which have been focused on local law enforcement intelligence, homeland security, state police, National Guard units and the like," Gaffney said. "We're seeing a considerable ramping-up of interest in getting this kind of training."
Government terrorism experts call the views expressed in the center's book inaccurate and counterproductive. They say the DHS should increase its training of local police, using teachers who have evidence-based DHS spokeswoman Amy Kudwa said the department does not maintain a list of terrorism experts but is working on guidelines for local authorities wrestling with the topic.
So far, the department has trained 1,391 local law enforcement officers in analyzing public information and 400 in analytic thinking and writing skills. Kudwa said the department also offers counterterrorism training through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which this year enrolled 94 people in a course called "Advanced Criminal Intelligence Analysis to Prevent Terrorism."
A lack of useful information
The DHS also provides local agencies a daily flow of information These reports are meant to inform agencies about possible terror threats. But some officials say they deliver a never-ending stream of information that is vague, alarmist and often useless. "It's like a garage in your house you keep throwing junk into until you can't park your car in it," says Michael Downing, deputy chief of counterterrorism and special operations for the Los Angeles Police Department.
A review of nearly 1,000 DHS reports dating back to 2003 and labeled "For Official Use Only" underscores Downing's description. Typical is one from May 24, 2010, titled "Infrastructure Protection Note: Evolving Threats to the Homeland."
It tells officials to operate "under the premise that other operatives are in the country and could advance plotting with little or no warning." Its list of vulnerable facilities seems to include just about everything: "Commercial Facilities, Government Facilities, Banking and Financial and Transportation . . ."
Bart R. Johnson, who heads the DHS's intelligence and analysis office, defended such reports, saying that threat reporting has "grown and matured and become more focused." The bulletins can't be more specific, he said, because they must be written at the unclassified level.
Recently, the International Association of Chiefs of Police agreed that the information they were receiving had become "more timely and relevant" over the past year.
Downing, however, said the reports would be more helpful if they at least assessed threats within a specific state's boundaries.
States have tried to do that on their own, but with mixed, and at times problematic, results.
In 2009, for instance, after the DHS and the FBI sent out several ambiguous reports about threats to mass-transit systems and sports and entertainment venues, the New Jersey Regional Operations Intelligence Center's Threat Analysis Program added its own information. "New Jersey has a large mass-transit infrastructure," its report warned, and "an NFL stadium and NHL/NBA arenas, a soccer stadium, and several concert venues that attract large crowds."
In Virginia, the state's fusion center published a terrorism threat assessment in 2009 naming historically black colleges as potential hubs for terrorism.
infiltrating and labeling as terrorists local groups devoted to human rights, antiwar causes and bike lanes.
And in Pennsylvania this year, a local contractor hired to write intelligence bulletins filled them with information about lawful meetings as varied as Pennsylvania Tea Party Patriots Coalition gatherings, antiwar protests and an event at which environmental activists dressed up as Santa Claus and handed out coal-filled stockings.
'We have our own terrorists'
Even if the information were better, it might not make a difference for the simplest of reasons: In many cities and towns across the country, there is just not enough terrorism-related work to do.
In Utah on one recent day, one of five intelligence analysts in the state's fusion center was writing a report about the rise in teenage overdoses of an over-the-counter drug. Another was making sure the visiting president of Senegal had a safe trip. Another had just helped a small town track down two people who were selling magazine subscriptions and pocketing the money themselves.
In the Colorado Information Analysis Center, some investigators were following terrorism leads. Others were looking into illegal Craigslist postings and online "World of Warcraft" gamers.
The vast majority of fusion centers across the country have transformed themselves into analytical hubs for all crimes and are using federal grants, handed out in the name of homeland security, to combat everyday This is happening because, after 9/11, local law enforcement groups did what every agency and private company did in Top Secret America: They followed the money.
The DHS helped the Memphis Police Department, for example, purchase 90 surveillance cameras, including 13 that monitor bridges and a causeway. It helped buy the fancy screens on the walls of the Real Time Crime Center, as well as radios, robotic surveillance equipment, a mobile command center and three bomb-sniffing dogs. All came in the name of port security and protection to critical infrastructure.
Since there hasn't been a solid terrorism case in Memphis yet, the equipment's greatest value has been to help drive down city crime. Where the mobile surveillance cameras are set up, criminals scatter, said Lt. Mark Rewalt, who, on a recent Saturday night, scanned the city from an altitude of 1,000 feet.
Flying in a police helicopter, Rewalt pointed out some of the cameras the DHS has funded. They are all over the city, in mall parking lots, in housing projects, at popular street hang-outs. "Cameras are what's happening now," he marveled.
Meanwhile, another post-9/11 unit in Tennessee has had even less terrorism-related work to do.
The Tennessee National Guard 45th Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team, one of at least 50 such units around the country, was created to respond to what officials still believe is the inevitable release of chemical, biological or radiological material by terrorists.
The unit's 22 hazardous-materials personnel have the best emergency equipment in the state. A fleet of navy-blue vehicles - command, response, detection and tactical operations trucks - is kept polished and ready to roll in a garage at the armory in Smyrna.
The unit practices WMD scenarios constantly. But in real life, the crew uses the equipment very little: twice a year at NASCAR races in nearby Bristol to patrol for suspicious packages. Other than that, said Capt. Matt Hayes, several times a year they respond to hoaxes.
The fact that there has not been much terrorism to worry about is not evident on the Tennessee fusion center's Web site. Click on the incident map, and the state appears to be under attack.
Red icons of explosions dot Tennessee, along with blinking exclamation marks and flashing skulls. The map is labeled: "Terrorism Events and Other Suspicious Activity.
But if you roll over the icons, the explanations that pop up have nothing to do with major terrorist plots: "Johnson City police are investigating three 'bottle bombs' found at homes over the past three days," one description read recently. ". . . The explosives were made from plastic bottles with something inside that reacted chemically and caused the bottles to burst."
Another told a similar story: "The Scott County Courthouse is currently under evacuation after a bomb threat was called in Friday morning. Update: Authorities completed their sweep . . . and have called off the Nine years after 9/11, this map is part of the alternative geography that is Top Secret America, where millions of people are assigned to help stop terrorism. Memphis Police Director Godwin is one of them, and he has his own version of what that means in a city where there have been 86 murders so far this year.
"We have our own terrorists, and they are taking lives every day," Godwin said. "No, we don't have suicide bombers - not yet. But you need to remain vigilant and realize how vulnerable you can be if you let up."

Before I start, let me make plain that I strongly approve of the idea of Mix*, and used to run a node on a high bandwidth (100m) circuit.  Despite my travails with Mix*, I would do it again if the stars were to line up That said, anyone considering running a mix* needs to know what they are getting themselves into, at least in the USA.
(1) Get used to the idea of angry mails from people you don't know, and who seem incapable of groking the concept of an anonymizer: they are *CERTAIN* that it was *you*, the host of a Mix* instance, that sent , nad by god they are going to "have your head" or something similar.  You'll get a lot of these, although you *can* safely ignore them (nevertheless, I try to educate them 1 time before doing so);
(2) You *may* get visits from the Government (and they are NOT here to help!).  I had two visits as a direct result of a Mix* instance: one from the FBI and one from the Secret Service.  These folk seem to educable, so if you keep our head and explain the lay of the land, they'll go away.  That does *not* mean you won't continue to be watched though, *especially* under the new "See Something, Report It" program established by our friend in "freedom" and "transparency", Obama;
(3) You *will* be the target of various sized DDoS attacks.  This is what finally forced me to take down my Mix* instance (racheal.mfn.org).  If you are running Mix* on a consumer circuit, you can be certain you will not last long after the DDoS begins, if you are on commercial circuits, your size *will* matter: large customers will [obviously] be tolerated longer.  I was finally "asked", very nicely I might add, to take mine down after about a year of semi-continuous DDoS (fortunately, most of these were small enough to just take down the Mix* box, but there were several times when the entire mutli-homed domain was down, along with our smaller (<100m) circuits.  Ideally, you should have out of band monitoring if you set up a Mix* instance (we used a cell-phone connected modem to our router), so that you can receive real-time notification of attacks;
(4) None of the above is true if you are not running an exit node.  With this in mind, I would encourage *everybody* to run a non-exit Mix* instance!  It's safe, easy, and won't get you in trouble at any speed!
(5) Expect to spend a few hours week looking after your Mix* instance.  While I know that my experience is considered unique, I had an ongoing issue of resource starvation that required a reboot once a week - minimum.  It's been a *long* time since I was running Mix*, so YMMV, and probably *will* vary.  Still, a Mix* node is a mid-to-high value target, and should be closely watched;
(6) Consider running an NNTP gateway.  These are in short supply and are greatly needed. Running an NNTP daemon is non-trivial, requiring a lot of work and some form of ongoing maintenance (variable by the complexity and "connectedness" of your instance, but it's worth it: you'll learn a *lot*!
(6a) If you run *any* NNTP tasks, be careful about what groups you process!  Running anything with "lolita", "asparagus", "young" or "teen" in the group name is just *begging* for trouble - and it *will* come looking for you!  If your NNTP instance has somehow spooled any "kiddie porn", and the fedz come knocking, you are *screwed*: there is virtually no defence to such a charge in the USA (under the Adam Walsh Act, an abominable piece of draconian legislation which is widely seen as "not going far enough" here in the ultra right wing repressive United States of Police).  This is true even if you are NOT running an exit node!!!
All the best,

My biggest complaint is being re-implemented, rather than "repaired": WL fell over when they used a person, rather than an organization account with no human corrolary, to act as the acceptor/releaser/ObjPublicRelationsFlac (Julian in WL case).  Much of the WL debacle has been caused by having Julian associated with WL in the first place.  Anyone who comes after him has the same problem: by acting as the releaser's mouthpiece, they become the face of the organization, and in turn they become the object being sold by the MSM, as opposed to the leaks themselves.  Any public interfacing should be from a role account, which acts as both an anonymizer and a composite "face" for the press.  Not having a real person to attach their interests to will help force their interest to concentrate upon the leaks themselves.

Utah Supreme Court hears ballot access case
Politics ; Court asked to determine whether they count in qualifying candidates for ballot.
By Cathy McKitrick
The Salt Lake Tribune
Updated: 06/02/2010 06:58:38 PM MDT
The use of electronic signatures in support of independent candidates and initiative petitions now lies in the hands of Utah's high court.
State Supreme Court justices, joined by 2nd District Judge Glen Dawson -- sitting in for retired Justice Michael Wilkins -- heard arguments Wednesday in the Anderson v. Bell case.
The justices took the matter under advisement and will rule later. Plaintiff Farley Anderson, an aspiring candidate for governor, asked for an expedited ruling so that, if he prevails, he can campaign.
"The people of Utah should have an alternative choice come this November," Anderson said
Lt. Gov. Greg Bell last March rejected Anderson as an unaffiliated candidate because a small portion of his requisite 1,000 signatures had been gathered online through the "I-Sign" system developed by Kanosh businessman Steve Maxfield.
Assistant Attorney General Thom Roberts argued the statute dealing with candidate nominations is paper-based. Roberts held up a list of typed names that had evidently been submitted electronically.
"Those don't look like signatures," Roberts said, questioning the lack of evidence to confirm their veracity.
"Did any one individual make a mark on a paper saying I intend this to be my signature?" Roberts asked. "There's nothing -- all there is is a typed list of names."
Chief Justice Christine Durham countered that all someone could tell from a hand-signed list is that the
signatures look different from one another.
"You don't know who placed them there, whether they're forgeries, whether someone signed for somebody else," Durham said. "You know nothing other than that they are signatures."
Roberts said he was troubled by the idea that Anderson's neighbors could call in their support and ask him to sign their names.
That could happen under the paper process as well, Durham said.
And if all the signatures resemble each other, "Mr. Anderson will get wise and start writing with his left hand," Durham said, eliciting laughter in the crowded courtroom.
The state's legal definition of signatures extends to electronic approvals, and Attorney Brent Manning -- brought on by the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah to represent Anderson -- argued that Bell overstepped his legal authority.
"We are operating in completely undirected territory in that the lieutenant governor has taken it upon himself to invalidate lawful signatures in this state," Manning said, noting it raises "severe constitutional issues."
The group Utahns for Ethical Government is seeking permission to file a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, arguing that electronic signatures should be allowed not only in qualifying candidates for the ballot, but also initiative petitions.
Outside the courtroom, Anderson voiced confidence in the outcome.
"I felt we were in very capable legal hands and that the argument was clear," Anderson said. "If they consider strictly the issue of 'did we meet the statutory scheme?,' we will certainly prevail."
Current state law allows government agencies to use electronic signatures once they have the appropriate security protocols in place, Roberts said, adding such processes have not been established for candidates and ballot Maxfield defended the safeguards installed in his trademarked I-Sign system, noting Mark Thomas, office administrator for the lieutenant governor, had given him suggestions on how to develop it.
"Everything was designed originally to make sure that the electronic signatures not only met the paper standards but exceeded them," Maxfield told The Tribune .
Roberts questioned whether Thomas's advice to Maxfield constituted a real collaborative effort.
"It's my understanding there was some communication between the two," Roberts said, "but in terms of working together to agree on a system, I think that that was not the case."
Paul Neuenschwander , Bell's chief of staff, agreed.
"We'll need computer experts who know what they're talking about -- the professionalism has yet to be established," Neuenschwander said.  No state currently recognizes electronic signatures to qualify candidates for the ballot, according to the Associated Press.

@_subject: fingerprinting traffic at ISP for big content 
This is a very common tactic: I received RIAA complaints of this form almost daily at the abuse desk.
Unfortunately, if they go to trial on these *losers*, the victim usually finds it cheaper to pay the settlement offer (usually around $300) than to pay a lawyer to get the thing thrown out of court.  We have a local lawyer that does the vast majority of these cases for the victims, and even he recommends settlement as the preferred step.
2gb? Are you serious? Not since the 90s. Today I would expect something more along the lines of 100gb to 500gb aggregated across a mid to large Most ISPs dont even bothe with deep inspection, as it unnecessary: they already have immunity, so whatever happens is the victims problem not the ISPs. The exceptions would be on hosted networks where deep inspection may be done for firewalling or statistical purposes (we did both: an inline splitter tap for statistics and an inline router for firewalling. Interestingly, these high volume lines are only rarely anywhere near capacity, and any reasonably current hardware can deal with deep inspection easily.
The ISPs are completely uninterested in litigation based on content: doing this would remove their current immunity as a simple carrier.  What they *are* interested in (at least some of them) are blocking or slowing down traffic which directly interferes with their own offerings, for example, VOIP.

Anxious that Wikileaks may be on the verge of publishing a batch of secret State Department cables, investigators are desperately searching for founder Julian Assange. Philip Shenon reports. Plus, Daniel Ellsberg tells The Daily Beast: "Assange is in Some Danger."
(This story has been updated to reflect new developments on Assange's whereabouts, including the cancelation of a scheduled appearance in Las Pentagon investigators are trying to determine the whereabouts of the Australian-born founder of the secretive website Wikileaks for fear that he may be about to publish a huge cache of classified State Department cables that, if made public, could do serious damage to national security, government officials tell The Daily Beast.
The officials acknowledge that even if they found the website founder, Julian Assange, it is not clear what they could do to block publication of the cables on Wikileaks, which is nominally based on a server in Sweden and bills itself as a champion of whistleblowers.
American officials said Pentagon investigators are convinced that Assange is in possession of at least some classified State Department cables leaked by a 22-year-old Army intelligence specialist, Bradley Manning of Potomac, Maryland, who is now in custody in Kuwait.
And given the contents of the cables, the feds have good reason to be The cables, which date back over several years, went out over interagency computer networks available to the Army and contained information related to American diplomatic and intelligence efforts in the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, the diplomat said.
American officials would not discuss the methods being used to find Assange, nor would they say if they had information to suggest where he is now. "We'd like to know where he is; we'd like his cooperation in this," one U.S. official said of Assange.
Assange, who first gained notoriety as a computer hacker [O,rly?], is as secretive as his website and has no permanent home.
He was scheduled to speak Friday in Las Vegas at an International Reporters and Editors conference. But the group.s executive director, Mark Horvit, tells The Daily Beast that Assange canceled the appearance - he was on a panel to discuss anonymous sources.within the last several days as a result of unspecificed .security concerns.. Horvit said he communicated with Assange through email and did not know where he might Last week, Assange was scheduled to join famed Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg for a talk at New York's Personal Democracy Forum. Assange appeared via Skype from Australia instead, saying lawyers recommended he not return to the United States.
Assange was in the United States as recently as several weeks ago, when he gave press interviews to promote the website.s release of an explosive 2007 video of an American helicopter attack in Baghdad that left 12 people dead, including two employees of the news agency Reuters.
Wikileaks has not replied directly to email messages from The Daily Beast.
However, in cryptic messages he sent this week via Twitter, Wikileaks referred to an earlier Daily Beast article on the investigation of Manning and said that it .looks like we.re about to be attacked by everything the U.S. has..
In an earlier post, the site said that allegations that .we have been sent 260,000 classified U.S. embassy cables are, as far as we can tell, This morning, a new Wikileaks tweet went out: "Any signs of unacceptable behavior by the Pentagon or its agents towards this press will be viewed Pentagon investigators say that particular post may have been an effort by Wikileaks to throw them.and news organizations.off the track as the site prepared the library of State Department cables for release, officials .It looks like they.re playing some sort of semantic games,. one American official said of Wikileaks. .They may not have 260,000 cables, but they.ve probably got enough cables to make trouble..
In another cryptic Twitter message, the site said that while the State Department might be alarmed about the prospect of the release of classified cables, .we have not been contacted..
American officials were unwilling to say what would happen if Assange is tracked down, although they suggested they would have many more legal options available to them if he were still somewhere in the United States.
Manning has reportedly admitted that he downloaded 260,000 diplomatic cables and provided them to Wikileaks. In Internet chat logs first revealed by Wired  magazine, Manning also took credit for leaking the 2007 video to the website.
.Hillary Clinton and several thousand diplomats around the world are going to have a heart attack when they wake up one morning and find an entire repository of classified foreign policy is available,. Manning wrote of the diplomatic cables, according to Wired.
Wikileaks has not confirmed that Manning is a source of any information posted on the site. .We do not know if Mr. Manning is our source, but the U.S. military is claiming he is, so we will defend him,. Wikileaks said in another Twitter message.
Manning was turned in to the Pentagon by a former computer hacker based in California, Adrian Lamo, after Manning approached Lamo for counsel. Manning is believed to have contacted Lamo after reading a recent profile of him in Wired.
In the chat log revealed by Wired, Manning bragged to Lamo about having downloaded a huge library of State Department cables, as well as the 2007 video of the helicopter attack, and having provided the material to Manning took credit for having leaked a classified diplomatic cable that has already appeared on the site.a memo prepared by the United States embassy in Reykjavik, Iceland, that described a meeting there between American and Icelandic officials over that country.s banking meltdown.
The January 2010 memo may have been of special interest to Wikileaks given the site.s close ties to Iceland, where Assange has based himself at times and where he worked with local lawmakers to draft free-speech laws that give broad freedom to journalists to protect their sources.
A profile this week in The New Yorker magazine depicted Assange feverishly at work with Icelandic colleagues in Reykjavik in March as he organized the release of the 2007 video of the helicopter attack. The edited video was given the title Collateral Murder, and its release infuriated officials at the Defense Department.
With its network of whistleblowers, Wikileaks has published documents and videos on its site that have outraged other foreign governments. To protect the site from attack by intelligence agencies, Assange has placed Wikileaks on several Internet servers, making it all but impossible for any government to shut down the site entirely.

@_subject: Daniel Ellsberg: Julian Assange is in danger 
As feds hunt for Wikileaks. Julian Assange in hopes of preventing him  from publishing diplomatic secrets, Samuel P. Jacobs talks with Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg about why he should stay out of America.and why some things should be kept secret.
Government officials tell The Daily Beast that they are searching for Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, whom they believe is in possession of State Department secrets leaked to him by an Army intelligence specialist now under arrest. As Assange, the Australian champion of whistleblowers cancelled a public appearance in Las Vegas Friday night, The Daily Beast talked with Daniel Ellsberg, the legendary leaker of the Pentagon Papers about Assange.s safety and what he would do if he were in possession of the State Department.s confidential traffic. Since standing trial for providing state secrets to newspapers.he was acquitted in 1973.Ellsberg has become an author and activist. The Daily Beast: Could the release of the diplomatic cables said to be in the possession of Wikileaks endanger national security?
Daniel Ellsberg: Any serious risk to that national security is extremely low. There may be 260,000 diplomatic cables. It.s very hard to think of any of that which could be plausibly described as a national security risk. Will it embarrass diplomatic relationships? Sure, very likely.all to the good of our democratic functioning. The embarrassment would be our awareness that we are supporting and facilitating dictators and corrupt and murderous governments, and we are quite aware of their nature.
An example would be surrounding a visit of Hamid Karzai to this country.where he is given a special audience with the president. We know that privately he is seen realistically. We know that because of the leak, which I think started out of this investigation. We know that because of the leak from Ambassador Eikenberry. He describes him as irredeemably corrupt, not an appropriate partner for a pacification program, and cannot They would regard this as very embarrassing, [since publicly they.ve been] saying, he is a perfectly suitable partner for pacification, working on corruption.Ha ha..Bullshit.
Do you think Assange is in danger?
I happen to have been the target of a White House hit squad myself. On May 3, 1972, a dozen CIA assets from the Bay of Pigs, Cuban imigris were brought up from Miami with orders to .incapacitate me totally.. I said to the prosecutor, .What does that mean? Kill me.. He said, .It means to incapacitate you totally. But you have to understand these guys never use the word .kill...
Is the Obama White House anymore enlightened than Nixon.s?
We.ve now been told by Dennis Blair, the late head of intelligence here, that President Obama has authorized the killing of American citizens overseas, who are suspected of involvement in terrorism. Assange is not American, so he doesn.t even have that constraint. I would think that he is in some danger. Granted, I would think that his notoriety now would provide him some degree of protection. You would think that would protect him, but you could have said the same thing about me. I was the number one defendant. I was on trail but they brought up people to beat me up.
You believe he is in danger of bodily harm, then?
Absolutely. On the same basis, I was..Obama is now proclaiming rights of life and death, being judge, jury, and executioner of Americans without due process. No president has ever claimed that and possibly no one since John the First.
What advice would you give Assange?
Stay out of the U.S. Otherwise, keep doing what he is doing. It.s pretty valuable.He is serving our democracy and serving our rule of law precisely by challenging the secrecy regulations, which are not laws in most cases, in this country.
He is doing very good work for our democracy. If [the alleged leaker, Bradley Manning] has done what he is alleged to have done, I congratulate him. He has used his opportunities very well. He has upheld his oath of office to support the Constitution. It so happens that enlisted men also take an oath to obey the orders of superiors. Officers don.t make that oath, only to the Constitution. But sometimes the oath to the Constitution and oath to superiors are in conflict.
Assange has taken the position that all information should be out there. Do you agree?
He has talked about not holding anything back. I wouldn.t agree with that. Some judgments should be made. Frankly, I don.t know whether he would really act on that.
In your opinion, not everything should be released.
Yes, there are things that should be kept secret for some period of time. It.s a matter of time that it can be kept. To say that there are no such things is unrealistic and doesn.t stand up under much thought. [Assange] is taking a position there that on its face is not sustainable, but he might well not keep it. He.s obviously a very competent guy in many ways.  I think his instincts are that most of this material deserves to be out. We are arguing over a very small fragment that doesn.t. He has not yet put out anything that hurt anybody.s national security.
And what about these cables in particular?
On the question of those 260,000 diplomatic cables, it is not my position that nothing in them could deserve to be secret, that nothing deserves to be secret. I don.t know. I haven.t read them. Having read a hell of a lot of diplomatic cables, I would confidently make the judgment that very little, less than one percent, one percent perhaps, can honestly be said to endanger national security. That.s distinct [from the percentage that could cause] embarrassment.very serious embarrassment, [if people] realize that we are aware of highly murderous and corrupt operations by people and that we are supporting them. It is very seriously embarrassing.
I think a better judgment would be to look over the 260,000 cables and exclude those which on their surface are dangerous. If the choice is between putting none of them out, as the State Department would like, and putting all of them out, I definitely feel our national security would be improved if they were put out. Between those two choices, I would rather see them all of them out. It would help understand our own foreign policy and give us the chance to improve it democratically. I hope they are out, I hope we get to see them.

It seems appropriate at this juncture to revisit this post from last year.  The FBI only needs a warrant or arrest to compile information we do not voluntarily give to them: who would be willing to bet that the SCOTUS will soon rule (if they havent already) that social networks are places that have "no reasonable expectation of privacy", thus allowing multiple millions of people on facebook to provide the FBI and others of their ilk with phenomenal seed data.  How many facebook accounts show faces, tats, scars, hair/eye/skin/etc color, often an audio sample - the list is theoretically endless.
The makings of GATTICA are right here in front of our eyes!  Who honestly believes that full DNA profiles won't become part of the live birth record when sequencing can be done in minutes rather than days?  Once you reach universal profiling, the rest is almost guaranteed by human nature itself.

Facebook wants to control the Web, like it or not
By Robert X. Cringely
Created 2010-04-23 11:08AM
Mark Zuckerberg may look and sound like the irritatingly self-satisfied rich kid you always hated in high school, but I.ll say this for him: He.s got cojones the size of tractor tires.
Facebook just made a play to take over the entire Web -- or at least, the parts that get the most traffic -- via its new "social graph [1],. officially unveiled at this week.s F8 confab.
[ Want to cash in on your IT experiences? InfoWorld is looking for stories of an amazing or amusing IT adventure, lesson learned, or war tale from the trenches. Send your story to offtherecord at infoworld.com [2]. If we publish it, we'll keep you anonymous and send you a $50 American Express gift cheque. ]
Some of the changes are cosmetic. Instead of declaring yourself .a fan. of, say, Red Bull or the Talking Heads or "I don.t care how comfortable Crocs are, you look like a dumbass [3]" on Facebook, you now simply Like them. The bigger change is that Facebook has now dismantled its garden walls and extended Like across the Web. Now you can express your Likes across a wide range of sites and have that information auto-magically transferred to your Facebook page, as well as the pages of everyone on your friends list.
You can also see who else on your Facebook list shares your deep abiding affection for the Bay City Rollers or Hello Kitty boxer shorts -- on the page itself.
In addition, Facebook has decided to generously share your personal information with .select. business partners. Right now that includes just three: Pandora, Yelp, and Microsoft.s Docs.com. This is what Facebook is calling "instant personalization [4]" -- grabbing information from your public Facebook page and using it to "improve" your experience on other If you.re not expecting this, it can be a bit jarring, as IT World.s Thank You for Not Sharing blogger Dan Tynan [5] explains:
    I couldn't sleep this morning, so I schlepped down to the nearest Wifi cafe. plugged in my noise-canceling ear phones and dialed up Pandora. Before I'd even logged in, the site launched into one of my favorite Tom Waits songs, "Jockey Full of Bourbon," followed by songs from John Lee Hooker and Tift Merritt [6]. Bang bang bang, three of my top artists, just like that.
    Coincidence? Nope. Pandora pulled my musical preferences from my public Facebook profile. I didn't ask it to. It just did. It was both cool and just the tiniest bit creepy.
This must be what Facebook was talking about when it unveiled proposed changes to its privacy policy [7] last month. To wit:
    In the proposed privacy policy, we've also explained the possibility of working with some partner websites that we pre-approve to offer a more personalized experience at the moment you visit the site. In such instances, we would only introduce this feature with a small, select group of partners and we would also offer new controls.
At the time, they were just .discussing. implementing these changes. Guess we.re done talking about it.
As usual with Facebook, you.re already entered into their nefarious scheme by default, though you can opt out. But it.s not exactly a cakewalk. PC World.s JR Raphael details the multistep tango [8] for turning off auto-sharing and disentangling your data from third-party sites.
Zuckerberg talks about the convenience of the Social Graph, and he.s right

"We don't pick up weapons to kill people to start the revolution. A revolution is really easy to do these days. What is the system? The system is built on the power of the banks. So it must be destroyed through the banks," he said.
While the idea should be sound, the fact is that the banks *own* the governments now, so they'll just get new bailouts and big bonuses for the executive.  If were were actually playing by the rules, the banks that impoded would be dead, and their corpses would be scavenged by others (leaving the burned consumers to either sit there awaiting an endless string of re-runs, or to work hard for appropriate legislation designed to prevent recurrences).

Certainly, however, that's not something Tor is really designed to mask - Tor is designed to mask the people requesting services via Tor.  While Tor is likely quite secure in most respects, good intelligence does not necessarily require that the content of any request be known: there are many facets to any communication, and things like the existence of a particular target is certainly usable intel.  Tor is designed to inhibit a number of attacks, including traffic analysis, but there is *no* absolute guarantee that every possible attack is known, or even just coded for. If your life relies on anonymity services, you will likely be a whole lot more careful than if it's seen as something you "merely provide to others on extra bandwidth".

As for "growth", or "increase in value", these are concepts not totally out of place in the vaccum of what amounts to self-imposed isolation for your *own* research goals.  The closest thing to money down there is time, which is traded much as we trade the tokens of bills and coin.  And time is fixed in quantity: everyone has the same fraction of the total to start with, the total cannot grow or shrink, but it can (and does) rise in value as the distance from the start of the "shift" gets longer.

[OT but interesting. The image produced [see link] looks a lot like what you'd get taking an x-ray photomicrograph of DNA (helical ladder formations from ).]
During the hunt for the predicted ripples in space-time . known as gravitational waves . physicists stumbled across a rather puzzling phenomenon. Last year, I reported about the findings of scientists using the GEO600 experiment in Germany. Although the hi-tech piece of kit hadn.t turned up evidence for the gravitational waves it was seeking, it did turn up a lot of noise.
Before we can understand what this .noise. is, we need to understand how equipment designed to look for the space-time ripples caused by collisions between black holes and supernova explosions.
Gravitational wave detectors are incredibly sensitive to the tiniest change in distance. For example, the GEO600 experiment can detect a fluctuation of an atomic radius over a distance from the Earth to the Sun. This is achieved by firing a laser down a 600 meter long tube where it is split, reflected and directed into an interferometer. The interferometer can detect the tiny phase shifts in the two beams of light predicted to occur should a gravitational wave pass through our local volume of space. This wave is theorized to slightly change the distance between physical objects. Should GEO600 detect a phase change, it could be indicative of a slight change in distance, thus the passage of a gravitational wave.
While looking out for a gravitational wave signal, scientists at GEO600 noticed something bizarre. There was inexplicable static in the results they were gathering. After canceling out all artificial sources of the noise, they called in the help of Fermilab.s Craig Hogan to see if his expertise of the quantum world help shed light on this anomalous noise. His response was as baffling as it was mind-blowing. .It looks like GEO600 is being buffeted by the microscopic quantum convulsions of space-time,. Hogan said.
Come again?
The signal being detected by GEO600 isn.t a noise source that.s been overlooked, Hogan believes GEO600 is seeing quantum fluctuations in the fabric of space-time itself. This is where things start to get a little According to Einstein.s view on the universe, space-time should be smooth and continuous. However, this view may need to be modified as space-time may be composed of quantum .points. if Hogan.s theory is correct. At its finest scale, we should be able to probe down the .Planck length. which measures 10-35 meters. But the GEO600 experiment detected noise at scales of less than 10-15 meters.
As it turns out, Hogan thinks that noise at these scales are caused by a holographic projection from the horizon of our universe. A good analogy is to think about how an image becomes more and more blurry or pixelated the more you zoom in on it. The projection starts off at Planck scale lengths at the Universe.s event horizon, but its projection becomes blurry in our local space-time. This hypothesis comes out of black hole research where the information that falls into a black hole is .encoded. in the black hole.s event horizon. For the holographic universe to hold true, information must be encoded in the outermost reaches of the Universe and it is projected into our 3 dimensional world.
But how can this hypothesis be tested? We need to boost the resolution of a gravitational wave detector-type of kit. Enter the .Holometer..
Currently under construction in Fermilab, the Holometer (meaning holographic interferometer) will delve deep into this quantum realm at smaller scales than the GEO600 experiment. If Hogan.s idea is correct, the Holometer should detect this quantum noise in the fabric of space-time, throwing our whole perception of the Universe into a spin.
For more on this intriguing experiment, read the Symmety Magazine article .Hogan.s holometer: Testing the hypothesis of a holographic universe..

Hoping to move the forum, I have cc'd a more appropriate place: followups are best sent there.
Do you fly now? Even with prepaid tickets, ID is a requirement, despite the provable fact that the production of ID does not increase *security* by even a single bit.  In fact, it has been shown (Bellovin?) than this is actually a *reducer* of security, as you can now test the waters and put together a bunch of aliases that are acceptable to the government's Even worse, the supposed "law" which "requires ID to fly" is *secret*, and that secrecy appears to be fine with the federal courts. We can now be held to account for SECRET LAWS.  That's a pretty big change all by The vast majority of the country's vagrancy laws were ruled unconstitutional in the late 80's (the guy with the cite, if it's necessary, is a trooper pal I cannot reach till monday, however he has made much ado about "this terrible injustice" :-)
Unfair != unconstitutional. No matter how many times you hear it.
Yet hotels only rarely ask for ID other than a credit card from which they can extract money for damages.  I can count the requests for ID on one hand, while credit card requests are universal and enforced (as a purely monetary policy should be).
Which has 100% nothing to do with the presentation of an ID to buy a ticket. Even valid ID.
Your experience and mine differ again.  I was an aux asshole in the 70's, and our training back then *far* exceeds what appears to be happening today.  Todays policeman is in fact a paramilitary soldier who has only a vague idea of what is or is not constitutional. Even for those who know, caring is pretty much dead - cops (and spies, etc) have been given carte blanche by the US Sheeple to do "whatever it takes" to "protect [us]". A little trampling of the constitution doesn't mean anything to anyone (see: torture, PATRIOT Act., and thousands of other examples).
Time to wake up and buy some ammunition, food, and make emergency travel arrangements ;-)
Which has nothing to do with the subject of anonymous travel.
*I* am *that guy*: I'd rather not be pulled over by *either* of them, as is my absolute constitutional right.
Until you said this, I thought you lived in Illinois. California is the only place I am aware of that has a no-chase policy, and even then, its a no *high speed* chase directive, [wisely & unusually] aimed at the protection of the public.
The false positive rate is reportedly around 5%, and is quite manageable for the circumstances in which it is used most often (the investigation of I used to purchase the drivers license database in the 1990s, just for giggles. Now that it's expensive, I have to get access via Westlaw or Lexis/Nexus, but it's still there.  As for the pictures, my understanding is that they are now available under FOIA (although I can't see it actualy being filled, due to the duplication cost requirements).
I have no doubt whatsoever that the day those records become sufficiently monetizable, they will do brisk business (maybe Facebook?)
Lowered "enthusiasm" != C&D.
The FEMA babies are the tinyest possible subset of the people who object to data collection.  Even then, just because they are worried about something we may consider unlikely, their argument is still sound.
It confirmed: you said your car's paper load had gone *down*.
[down] == [change]
The *contents* are irrelevent other than in the context of it being required for non-automobile travel.
While muddily phrased, I'll assume that was agreement?
Private persons are free to do what they want - the government is not.
I go into smaller courthouses *all the time* without ANY ID.  No gramps, either, unless court is "in session", and Judge Corruption is Ruling: then I see Grampa Bailiff once in a while.
Which you then acknowledged I had shown to be incorrect...
The definition is "It's impossible to travel anonymously in the USA unless it's on a local mass trasit system, or you have direct use of a car.  Air, rail, and bus travel are all now dependent on Federally recognized ID (see "Real ID Act").
It's even easeir to look and get a very accurate picture :-(

National Security Archive Update, April 21, 2011
THE LAST NSAM STANDING
Deconstructing a Secrecy Blunder:
A Study in Dysfunction
For more information contact:
John Prados - 202/994-7000
Washington, D.C., April 21, 2011 - The last remaining secret national security directive from the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, a National Security Action Memorandum on Laos, has finally been declassified, nearly fifty years after it was first issued, and was posted today on the Web site of the National Security Archive.
Today's posting is a case study of sorts--a selection of documents which are analyzed not so much for their historical value as for what the materials show about operation of the declassification system. This inquiry has its origins in a quest by Archive senior fellow Jeffrey T. Richelson to obtain the declassification of presidential national security directives issued since President Harry S. Truman. During the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, the highest level directives that flowed from the White House were called National Security Action Memoranda (NSAMs). President John F. Kennedy issued 173 NSAMs during his time in office. Reaching the point where only NSAM-29, on Laos, dated March 9, 1961, remained secret, Richelson finally obtained the declassification of this directive on October 29, 2010, almost fifty years after it was issued.
As the "last NSAM standing," NSAM 29 received significant attention inside the National Security Archive. But to the present author, the Archive's project director on Vietnam war records, it immediately seemed familiar. A search for related records produced a number of other items (also posted today) which provide the context for discussion of NSAM-29's release. More importantly, however, the search disclosed that the document, far from being the last NSAM standing, was already in the public domain, in multiple versions, some more than a decade old. Given present controversies over secrecy in America, the case of the last NSAM illuminates the enormous problems that are endemic in the declassification Continue reading at the National Security Archive's Web site:

National Security Archive Update, August 1, 2011
CIA FORCED TO RELEASE LONG SECRET OFFICIAL HISTORY OF BAY OF PIGS INVASION
National Security Archive lawsuit yields never-before-seen volumes of Massive Study; Agency continues to withhold Volume 5
For more information contact:
Peter Kornbluh - 202/994-7000
Washington, D.C., August 1, 2011 - Pursuant to a FOIA lawsuit filed by the National Security Archive on the 50th anniversary of the infamous CIA-led invasion of Cuba, the CIA has released four volumes of its Official History of the Bay of Pigs Operation. The Archive today posted volume 2, "Participation in the Conduct of Foreign Policy" which contains detailed information on the CIA's negotiations with Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama and Great Britain on support for the invasion.
"These are the last remaining secret records of U.S. aggression against Cuba," noted Peter Kornbluh, who directs the Cuba Documentation Project at the Archive. "The CIA has finally seen the wisdom of letting the public scrutinize this major debacle in the covert history of U.S. foreign policy." Kornbluh noted that the agency was "still refusing to release volume 5 of its official history." Volume 5 is a rebuttal to the stinging CIA's Inspector General's report, done in the immediate aftermath of the paramilitary assault, which held CIA officials accountable for a wide variety of mistakes, miscalculations and deceptions that characterized the failed invasion. The National Security Archive obtained the declassification of the ultra-secret Inspector General's report in 1998.
Volume 2 provides new details on the negotiations and tensions with other countries, including Great Britain, which the CIA needed to provide logistical and infrastructure support for the invasion preparations. The volume describes Kennedy Administration efforts to sustain the cooperation of Guatemala, where the main CIA-led exile brigade force was trained, as well as the deals made with Anastacio Somoza to gain Nicaragua's support for the invasion.
Volume 3 of the Official History was previously declassified under the Kennedy Assassination Record Act. The Archive will post a detailed assessment of the declassified history, along with two other volumes tomorrow.

@_subject: [cryptography] CICM Scope (fwd) 
Reply-To: Crypto discussion list (Cross-posted on the Cryptography mailing list at randombit.net)
I've been doing a bit of reading based on the comments we've received.
The results of the BOF at IETF 81 suggested we should broaden our
scope and discuss the impact of the CICM Model, particularly Security
Domain Separation, on (2 or more) existing IETF protocols.
Here are the suggestions we've heard to-date (in no particular order):
  * IPsec (suggested by almost everyone)
  * TLS (via Paul Hoffman, David McGrew)
  * AEAD (in RFC 5116; via David McGrew)
  * VPN establishment crypto protocols (via Alfonso De Gregorio)
  * Domain Security Services (as in RFC 3183; via Alfonso De Gregorio)
** Alfonso:
  Can you elaborate on which protocols you had in mind regarding VPN?
It seems clear that, at the very least, we should look at IPsec.
Perhaps first, however, we should put together a crisper version of
draft-lanz-cicm-lm "CICM Logical Model" which we can then use as the
basis for analysis to address questions like: (via David McGrew)
  * What benefit does the CICM model provide in cases where there
    isn't a strict separation between security domains?
  * How can the CICM model operate if only one of the communicating
    parties uses the model?
  * What is the impact of having queues between plaintext and
    ciphertext on:
    - latency
    - jitter
    - retransmission timers
    - TCP startup time
    - bufferbloat
  * What is the impact of not providing return codes to a secure-side
    application sending a packet? What about "no route to host" and     MTUs?
  * Regarding applying the CICM model to IPsec:
    - How would it map onto the IPsec Security Association Database?
    - Where do the different parts of the IPsec architecture reside?
    - How is information that needs to cross domains (e.g., TOS byte)
      handled?
    - How is ICMP handled?
At a higher level, we could also address questions such as:
  * How can we further push responsibility for performing cryptography
    correctly into the crypto (e.g., being responsible for
    initialization vectors)? (via David McGrew)
  * How can we improve integrity guarantees between security domains
    or among system-level components? (via Alfonso De Gregorio)
  * How can we improve the practice of transmitting and storing data     at mixed levels of sensitivity? (via Joe Mitola)
Other ideas / questions?
Are there other people / WGs we should get involved?

@_subject: [cryptography] [cicm] CICM Scope (fwd) 
Reply-To: Crypto discussion list Absolutely. Thanks for asking.
IPsec is the most natural protocol we should look at, indeed.
In my opinion, the Secure Shell Connection Protocol (RFC 4254) is also
to be consider among the (de-facto) VPN establishment crypto
protocols, if we consider its most popular implementation. Let me
elaborate why this is the case.
As we know, the SSH protocol doesn't provide a VPN establishment
mechanism built-in. However, at the connection layer the IETF standard
defines the channel mechanism and specify the first four basic channel
types. Real world implementations have the possibility to build upon
this mechanism extending the protocol to accommodate new use cases.
This is what OpenSSH did with the tunnel forward extension. As of
version 4.3, OpenSSH supports layer 2 and layer 3 tunnelling via the
"tun at openssh.com" channel type. On network endpoints equipped with
pseudo-device interface like the BSD tun(4), this extended channel
type allows to forward layer 2 frames and layer 3 packets back and
forth, and hence to establish an encrypted VPN connections.
Building on the above, there is yet another IETF protocol that we
might want to consider in order to discuss the impact of CICM Model
and it is iSCSI (RFC 3720).
If we try to frame a CICM-enabled-iSCSI endpoint in the use cases
detailed in draft-lanz-cicm-lm, we would find it related to both the
HAIPE and the data-at-rest cases.
iSCSI uses the IPsec mechanism for providing integrity, authentication
and confidentiality at the IP level between the initiator and the
target (RFC 3723). Here, considerations originating from to the
presence of queues (e.g., latency) may be especially relevant.
At the same time, the data-at-rest use case is also relevant, when we
relax the architectural constraints, moving the cryptographic-module
interface to the storage from a local bus to the network.

@_subject: [cryptography] Single-key key recovery for full AES (fwd) 
Reply-To: Crypto discussion list I'm wondering how easily the new preimage attack they describe (on AES
in Davies-Meyer) can be applied to any of the AES-based SHA-3
Abstract follows
Since Rijndael was chosen as the Advanced Encryption Standard,
improving upon 7-round attacks on the 128-bit key variant or upon
8-round attacks on the 192/256-bit key variants has been one of the
most difficult challenges in the cryptanalysis of block ciphers for
more than a decade. In this paper we present a novel technique of
block cipher cryptanalysis with bicliques, which leads to the
following results:
  - The first key recovery attack on the full AES-128 with computational complexity 2^126.1
  - The first key recovery attack on the full AES-192 with computational complexity 2^189.7
  - The first key recovery attack on the full AES-256 with computational complexity 2^254.4
  - Attacks with lower complexity on the reduced-round versions of AES not considered before,
   including an attack on 8-round AES-128 with complexity 2^124.9
  - Preimage attacks on compression functions based on the full AES versions.
In contrast to most shortcut attacks on AES variants, we do not need
to assume related-keys.  Most of our attacks only need a very small
part of the codebook and have small memory require- ments, and are
practically verified to a large extent. As our attacks are of high
computational complexity, they do not threaten the practical use of
AES in any way.

Reply-To: raisethefist at lists.riseup.net
GENEVA (AFP) - Human rights groups vowed Monday to pursue George W. Bush
wherever he travels, claiming that the former US president had cancelled
a trip to Switzerland over fears that he could be probed for torture.
Bush was due to attend a fund-raising gala evening in Geneva this week,
but organisers said Saturday that he had cancelled because of the risk
of disturbances.
"The reach of the Convention Against Torture is wide -- this case is
prepared and will be waiting for him wherever he travels next," said
Katherine Gallagher, an attorney and vice-president of the Paris-based
International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH)
Human rights groups pointed out that two "torture victims" were to have
filed a criminal complaint in Geneva against Bush, who was due to speak
at the gala here on February 12.
"Swiss law requires the presence of the torturer on Swiss soil before a
preliminary investigation can be opened," said the FIDH, the European
Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights and the Centre for
Constitutional Rights.
"When Bush cancelled his trip to avoid prosecution, the human rights
groups who prepared the complaints made (them) public and announced that
the Bush torture indictment would be waiting wherever he travels next,"
they added in a statement.
In his memoirs published last year, Bush claimed that use of the water
boarding technique -- which simulates drowning -- had directly prevented
terror attacks in Britain and the United States.
He also said in an interview with the British newspaper The Times it was
"damn right" that he had authorised use of the controversial method on
Al-Qaeda's 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
"Waterboarding is torture, and Bush has admitted, without any sign of
remorse, that he approved its use," said Gallagher.
"Torturers -- even if they are former presidents of the United States --
must be held to account and prosecuted. Impunity for Bush must end."
Gavin Sullivan, a lawyer at the European Centre for Constitutional and
Human Rights, added that Bush "bears ultimate responsibility for
authorizing the torture of thousands of individuals at places like
Guantanamo and secret CIA 'black sites'.
"As all states are obliged to prosecute such torturers, Bush has good
reason to be very worried," he said.
Human Rights Watch said in New York that the US authorities themselves
should be pursuing Bush.
"The US government should take the lead to investigate former US
President George W. Bush and other senior officials for authorizing
torture of terrorism suspects rather than leaving prosecutions to other
countries," the organization said.
"The US government needs to demonstrate that no official, including an
ex-president, is above the law," said Kenneth Roth, executive director
of Human Rights Watch.

There's been a very strange episode being written about the past couple of days involving numerous parties, including me, that I now want to comment on.  The story, first reported by The Tech Herald, has been been written about in numerous places (see Marcy Wheeler, Forbes, The Huffington Post, BoingBoing, Matt Yglesias, Reason, Tech Dirt, and others), so I'll provide just the summary. Last week, Aaron Barr, a top executive at computer security firm HB Gary, boasted to the Financial Times that his firm had infiltrated and begun to expose Anonymous, the group of pro-WikiLeaks hackers that had launched cyber attacks on companies terminating services to the whistleblowing site (such as Paypal, MasterCard, Visa, Amazon and others).  In retaliation, Anonymous hacked into the email accounts of HB Gary, published 50,000 of their emails online, and also hacked Barr's Twitter and other online accounts. Among the emails that were published was a report prepared by HB Gary -- in conjunction with several other top online security firms, including Palantir Technologies -- on how to destroy WikiLeaks.  The emails indicated the report was part of a proposal to be submitted to Bank of America through its outside law firm, Hunton & Williams.  News reports have indicated that WikiLeaks is planning to publish highly incriminating documents showing possible corruption and fraud at that bank, and The New York Times detailed last month how seriously top bank officials are taking that threat.  The NYT article described that the bank's "counterespionage work" against WikiLeaks entailed constant briefings for top executives on the whistle-blower site, along with the hiring of "several top law firms" and Booz Allen (the long-time firm of former Bush DNI Adm. Michael McConnell and numerous other top intelligence and defense officials).  The report prepared by these firms was designed to be part of the Bank of America's highly funded anti-WikiLeaks campaign.
The leaked report suggested numerous ways to destroy WikiLeaks, some of them likely illegal -- including planting fake documents with the group and then attacking them when published; "creat[ing] concern over the security" of the site; "cyber attacks against the infrastructure to get data on document submitters"; and a "media campaign to push the radical and reckless nature of wikileaks activities."  Many of those proposals were also featured prongs of a secret 2008 Pentagon plan to destroy WikiLeaks. One section of the leaked report focused on attacking WikiLeaks' supporters and it featured a discussion of me.  A graph purporting to be an "organizational chart" identified several other targets, including former New York Times reporter Jennifer 8 Lee, Guardian reporter James Ball, and Manning supporter David House.  The report claimed I was "critical" to WikiLeaks' public support after its website was removed by Amazon and that "it is this level of support that needs to be disrupted"; absurdly speculated that "without the support of people like Glenn, WikiLeaks would fold"; and darkly suggested that "these are established professionals that have a liberal bent, but ultimately most of them if pushed will choose professional preservation over cause."  As The Tech Herald noted, "earlier drafts of the proposal and an email from Aaron Barr used the word 'attacked' over 'disrupted' when discussing the level of support."
In the wake of the ensuing controversy caused by publication of these documents, the co-founder and CEO of Palantir Tech, Alex Karp, has now issued a statement stating that he "directed the company to sever any and all contacts with HB Gary."  The full statement -- which can be read here

@_subject: World.s Total CPU Power: One Human Brain 
By John Timmer, Ars Technica
How much information can the world transmit, process, and store? Estimating this sort of thing can be a nightmare, but the task can provide valuable information on trends that are changing our computing and broadcast infrastructure. So a pair of researchers have taken the job upon themselves and tracked the changes in 60 different analog and digital technologies, from newsprint to cellular data, for a period of over 20 The trends they spot range from the expected.Internet access has pushed both analog and digital phones into a tiny niche.to the surprising, such as the fact that, in aggregate, gaming hardware has always had more computing power than the world.s supercomputers.
The authors were remarkably thorough. For storage media, they considered things like paper, film, and vinyl records, and such modern innovations as Blu-ray discs and memory cards. To standardize their measurements across media, they used Shannon.s information theory to consider data storage in terms of optimally compressed bits. They also tracked technology, noting that in the year 2000, bits of video were compressed using cinepak, which was far less efficient than the current MPEG-4 format; calculations were adjusted accordingly.
Even so, there are some significant estimations here. .For example,. the authors note, .after normalization on optimally compressed bits we can say things like .a 6 square-cm newspaper image is worth a 1,000 words...
Similar sorts of estimates are required for things like broadcast capability and two-way communications, both of which are compiled as bits-per-second figures. The researchers estimate typical consumption of broadcast media to figure out how much of the existing capacity is used, and they figure that, since telecom equipment is run to maximize the use of its capacity, it.s usually booked to close to its limit.
Computing capacity is converted into MIPS, and estimates for the total number and class of chips are available. The big question mark here is mostly in embedded controllers; it.s hard to estimate both their computational capacity and how many are out there.
So these are pretty rough estimates, but similar assumptions are made at all four time points examined between 1986 and 2007. That should allow comparisons of trends across the time period, even if the absolute values of the estimates are a bit off.
Some trends are very, very obvious. Analog video accounted for over half the data stored in 1986 (vinyl LPs and cassette tapes accounted for over a quarter), and video held 86 percent of all stored data by 1993, squeezing out nearly everything else.
By 2000, CDs and digital tape started pushing back, but analog video still stood at 70 percent of all stored data. By 2007, analog video had plunged to a tiny six percent, eclipsed by hard disks, Blu-ray and DVDs, and digital tape.
During that time, total storage capacity grew at about 23 percent annually, and it topped out at 2.9 x 1020 bytes.that.s about 300 exabytes, or 61 CDs for everyone on the planet.
A similar shift to digital occurred in broadcast media and two-way communications. Back in 1986, 80 percent of broadcast capacity was used for terrestrial TV, although analog cable was already a presence. Today, broadcast TV has fallen to 50 percent; a quarter of the broadcast data is now some form of digital, and analog cable is declining from its peak in Two-way communications underwent a far more dramatic shift. In 1986, analog phones handled 80 percent of the data, with digital phones taking the other 20 percent; everything else was a rounding error. By 2000, analog telephony was down to two percent of the world.s two-way Digital telephony peaked in 1993 at 67 percent; fixed Internet connections accounted for one percent of usage that year. By 2000, it was up to 50 percent, and it.s now at 97 percent. Nothing else cleared one percent.
Two-way communications handled 65 exabytes in 2007, dwarfed by broadcasting, which sent a whopping 2 zetabytes of data. But, while broadcasting is increasing at a linear rate, the advent of the Internet has given two-way transmissions a big boost, increasing the bytes transmitted by a factor of 29 in just 7 years.
Computation is probably the most varied mix of hardware of the lot. Back in 1986, pocket calculators represented about 40 percent of all computer capacity, beating out PCs at 33 percent and servers at 17 percent. Even then, gaming hardware held a nine percent share.
Calculators were gone by 2000, when the PC peaked at 86 percent and the mobile phone/PDA first appeared at 3 percent. By 2007, phones held six percent of world processing power, but the big story was gaming hardware, which shot up to a quarter of the total computational capacity, pushing the PC back down to a two-thirds share. Supercomputers are apparently rare enough not to measure.
One surprising result of the research is the amount of total horsepower found in the application-specific space, where the authors considered only DSPs, microcontrollers, and GPUs (GPUs alone account for 97 percent of this category.s capacity). And that capacity is huge, about 30 times that of all the general purpose computation hardware. GPUs account for the lion.s share of the 6.4 x 1018 operations a second that the planet can now perform, and they showed a compound annual growth rate of 86 percent over the study period.
Lest we get too enamored with our technological prowess, however, the authors make some comparisons with biology. .To put our findings in perspective, the 6.4*1018 instructions per second that human kind can carry out on its general-purpose computers in 2007 are in the same ballpark area as the maximum number of nerve impulses executed by one human brain per second,. they write.
Our total storage capacity is the same as an adult human.s DNA. And there are several billion humans on the planet.

I'm tired of hearing the current calls for "mesh networks" myself. As you point out, they are *incredibly* complex, and these "wall-wart servers" aren't going to implement that kind of thing IMO.  Christ, large ISPs still have trouble with simple IP, and they have "trained [or] experienced 'engineers'".  It's a silly call to arms at this point.
I was with a group that tried to work out a mesh implementation across a relatively small (~15sq miles) area, and it never came to fruition, despite several years of work on the problems presented.
I don't even see *that* coming from this particular ?press release?.  Just a "build it and people will do it" [hrmm.. Build it and They will come". Where have I heard *that* before?] theme, with no particular goal in mind other than wide "implementation (which is glaringly undefined)".  Whats the point, and how do I know that these guys are even competent to decide on a goal - just because they're with EFF?  A lawyer who likes to code is a *long* way from the kind of talent that can make these little things useful for anything more than maybe [sntp server||dns server-small||etc.).
Has anyone looked at the scaling problems of having these warts fully disseminated into the population, and "plugged in"?

Note: Reply made on a free form stream-of-consciousness basis.
Thats not as easy as it sounds, especially in hyperdense cities - although I will also admit that this is more a 70% administrative issue than an technical issue.
It's unlikely that anyone in their right minds is going to just open up their networks to both unlimited and unmonitored connections, but even if they do, they are going to demand some allocation control and accountability.  Not that it's necessary for any technical reason, but because it's required for the people who both pay the network bills and receive FBI "letters" / subpoenas: even the smallest networks have some kind of "security department", even if it's the same guy who does everything else there.  This is where the idea truly breaks down.  I wouldn't allow an open wifi connection when I know that any illicit activities are going to come back to haunt *me* when the FBI does their next "predator sweep".  No municipality is going to allow geocoded/derived addressing for the exact same reason: they want to be able to point the finger when the time comes.  They also want to know if your node is acting up, where they can go /phone to make you fix it.  Mesh networks are a political disaster *before* anyactual engineering time goes in.  But if you are lucky enough to get past the politics (hard.  really hard.), then you start down the actual engineering pipe: traffic planning and engineering is at best difficult, at worst impossible, without centralized control. So do we just assume that the warts know not to exceed bandwidth(x), and plan for max(y) warts per square mile/kilometer?  Do we assume that all these warts are going to be using passive connections for ftp?  this road leads back to political questions by the way. The residential carriers will go postal if 100k home connections are suddenly offering services and draining back through the cable/dsl drains, against their AUP/ToS. If you choose to create layer 2 drain solutions you are back to tight and centralized allocation control.
This was a municipal project, so I can't point you anywhere: sorry.  As for what went wrong: everything.  Everyone who touches the mesh has questions/issues of the nature I alluded to above.  Muni IT demands to be able to track back every ip to a known user, meaning any kind of geolocation solution is gone right off the bat.  By the way, the reasoning here wasn't what I was expecting: they were more concerned with virus control and quarantine (which implies a separate layer 2 sandbox for infected connections, or connections carrying infected traffic where such can be accurately and reliably determined - which is about 50% of the time).  The muni wanted a known IP for each user, with certain wifi hotspots exempted to local rfc1913 networks using DHCP.  We had interesting times with these hotspots too!  Not having enough IPs on a public wifi segment causes weird behaviour that the basic call desk cant troubleshoot, and that they don't recognize as being broken - so these spots get reputations as being "unreliable".  Significant automation was assembled just to keep track of required resources vs actual available resources, with traps going out when automation sees something we dont. The traffic engineering issues are perverse.  Meditate on them for a little while, and consider all of the ways you can slice your own throat.  Is a steady rise in users a trend, or did the bookings for conventions just have a good year?  Are you meeting peak demand, or are you oversubscribing on your backbone?  *Is* there a backbone?  Lots of questions at layers 1 and 2!  In fact, layer 2 is where you're going to spend a *lot* of your time, unlike the operation of a more traditional IP network, where you spend the vast majority of your time at layer 3.  Segregation is a necessary ingredient, as well as scanning-on-allocation to check for blatantly rooted connections.  This gets tricky as hell.
We were asked to plan for each muni supporting drains for the connections made within their geographic areas: oops! Looks like I want geo-derived addresses again!  Except that these same munis have the additional condition of only wanting to allocate for their own taxpayers: oops!  Back to centralized control and allocation...  Round and round you go...
Everyone here knows IP well, and can add a hundred things that I've not touched on.  Every time you add a condition, you increase complexity, and these increases are *not* linear!
I never alleged that he was stupid.  I know he's no moron.  But he's also not thinking this through, he's looking to build the device before he knows his application.  Thats fine for general purpose machinery with lots of cycles and storage to spare, but a wart is likely to be max'd out at ultra-small storage and cpu limits:  virtually every wart-driven device was designed to act as a simple bridge or router, which requires surprisingly little computing power: An old 386 is massive overkill for acting as a router on lines up to about 3mbps - while these warts may have more *cycles* available than an old throwaway box, they are going to have [at best] a few hundred megabytes of flash storage: not a lot of room there for anything meaningful.
I can assume people will do *something* with them, but *useful* things, no, I cannot just assume that - that will be something I'll have to see to

What exactly was on these posters? Self-defense information, or weapon how-does-it-work type stuff?
HOW COOL IS *THAT*!  Weapon education chamers? Shit!  I grew up in NYC, where there are *zero* legal guns, unless you're LEA or one of the under 100 people who could afford the weekly $500.00 bribe!  Not that handguns weren't all over the schools - almost everyone in my class carried at IS44 (IS == "Intermediate School". Kinda of like junior high school and high school all in one: grades 6-12), since the likelyhood of needing to defend yourself was very close to 100%  NYC schools in the 60's were horror shows, even in the better neighborhoods (which I certainly didn't live!).
Our "weapons education" was going out at night and shooting out street lamps (at $1.00 per shot to the betting pool - first to take the light gets the pool. Not so easy with a <3 inch barrel on a saturday night special!).  I am in envy of you and your schools :-)

Interesting: I have *never* heard the EBS et al used other than for testing.  Had I ever heard it, it would have scared the crap out of me - I don't know if I'd even hear past that point, having spent a childhood listening to that damned system being "tested" all the time (?I believe it was weekly or bi-monthly?).  Like most Americans alive through the period, I can still recite, word for word, the text of the EBS "test" test.  The broadcasters in your area, in voluntary cooperation with the FCC and other authorities, have developed this system to keep you informed in the event of an emergency.  If this had been an actual emergency, you would have been instructed where to tune in your area for news and other local information.  This concludes our test of the Emergency Broadcast Interestingly, the EBS had at least one accidental activation in the late 60's or early 1970s, which I fortunately missed out on: good for me!
Very.  But then we wouldn't have paid any attention to it when the Russians were finally ready to end it all!

@_subject: Forensics On Trial 
Forensics Under the Microscope
More courts are starting to question the .facts. proved by scientific Warren Horinek did not murder his wife. That.s what he said, that.s what the medical examiner said, that.s what the homicide sergeant said. Even the district attorney.s office in the Horineks. hometown of Ft. Worth, Texas, agreed that he was innocent.not something a Texas prosecutor typically says. But when Bonnie Horinek died in 1995, her parents refused to believe what the evidence strongly suggested.that Bonnie shot herself.and instead they enlisted the services of a blood-spatter analyst to prove that it was their son-in-law who had killed their daughter.
The spatter analyst zeroed in on the blood-soaked T shirt Horinek was wearing when the paramedics arrived. To him, the fine spray of blood on Horinek.s left shoulder was not from administering CPR, as Warren said it was, and as the 911 recording seemed to indicate, but from shooting Bonnie at close range. On the basis of that testimony, Horinek was convicted of murder and sentenced to 30 years. But did they really get their man? Horinek.s lawyers have filed a writ of habeas corpus to try to have him released, based in part on the National Academy.s report; much of the spatter analyst.s testimony, the lawyers argue, .was contrary to known and accepted science..
In the age of CSI and Dexter, we.re led to believe that forensic science is a high-tech discipline, powerful and sophisticated enough to catch any As it turns out, whether blood-spatter analysis and disciplines like it qualify as .science. at all is a matter of increasing debate. In a sharply critical report issued in 2009, the National Academy of Sciences said, .The simple reality is that the interpretation of forensic evidence is not always based on scientific studies.. Taking aim at disciplines as varied as ballistics, hair and fiber analysis, bite-mark comparison.even fingerprints.the report declared, .This is a serious problem..
The last few years have seemed to bear out the report. Dozens of elite crime labs all over the country, from Nassau County, N.Y., to San Francisco, to Virginia, Cleveland, Oklahoma, and Baltimore, have been involved in scandals involving mishandled evidence and false or misleading forensic testimony. This past summer, a North Carolina attorney general.s audit discovered that the state.s Bureau of Investigation had withheld or distorted evidence in more than 200 cases.
Even some of the best funded and most sophisticated crime-fighting organizations are being taken to task for their use of forensic evidence. This week, the New York Times reported that the Federal Buerau of Investigation had .overstated the strenght of genetic analysis. during the investigation of Bruce E. Ivins, who allegedly mailed anthrax to newsrooms and Senate offices in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.
A year-long investigation by the independent journalism nonprofit ProPublica revealed major problems in the nation.s coroner system: pathologists not certified in pathology, physicians who flunk their board exams, even coroners who are not physicians at all. .In nearly 1,600 counties across the country,. the investigation found, .elected or appointed coroners who may have no qualifications beyond a high-school degree have the final say on whether fatalities are homicides, suicides, accidents or the result of natural or undetermined causes..
For his forthcoming book, Convicting the Innocent: Where Criminal Prosecutions Go Wrong (Harvard University Press, April 2011), University of Virginia law professor Brandon Garrett examined the trial transcripts and other legal documents of the first 250 people to be exonerated by DNA in this country. He discovered that in more than half these cases, trials were tainted by .invalid, unreliable, concealed, or erroneous forensic evidence.. The errors ranged from analysts making up statistics on the fly, implying that their methods were more scientific than they actually were, and exaggerating or distorting their findings to support the Peter Neufeld, a lawyer in New York and cofounder of the Innocence Project, which has helped to facilitate many of these exonerations, calls it the .elastic expert: no matter what you see, I can distort it so that it would be a match..
This .elasticity. is possible because the tests are largely subjective. Just how much human judgment is required depends on the discipline: DNA testing is mostly.though not entirely.done by machine, for instance, whereas microscopic hair comparison is based solely on the analyst.s opinion. Even fingerprints, which many of us regard as foolproof tools for identifying culprits.think Dexter feeding a print into his computer and a bad guy.s photo and driver.s license appearing on the screen.in fact rely largely on human interpretation, and therefore are subject to human error.
One of the most famous examples of the danger of fingerprints was the case of Oregon lawyer Brandon Mayfield, arrested in 2004 in the wake of the Madrid train bombings. Working from a partial print that Spanish authorities had found on a plastic bag of detonators, several top FBI analysts declared Mayfield.s print a match. That is, until Spanish authorities identified Ouhnane Daoud, now wanted for terrorism in connection to the crime. When it became clear that Daoud.s prints were a much better match, the FBI was forced to admit that its own bias and .circular reasoning. had led them to Mayfield, who had no involvement in the bombings.
Part of the problem is what social scientists call .context bias.. Most forensics labs are located within police departments, so analysts may see themselves as working .for. the prosecution. They also usually have information about the evidence they.re testing.for example, that the suspect has a prior record. .There.s a lot of research to suggest that knowledge could have biasing effect,. says Jennifer Mnookin, a professor at the UCLA School of Law.
In a recent Supreme Court case, Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority, said that whether consciously or not, an analyst .responding to a request from a law enforcement official may feel pressure.or have an incentive.to alter the evidence in a manner favorable to the prosecution.. The judges. ruling means that forensic test results may be subject to the same kind of scrutiny as any other evidence, and an analyst from the lab that ran the test must be present in court to be cross-examined, just like any other witness.
.Obviously, most people in this community are trying to do their jobs well and are not trying to frame innocent people,. says the University of Virginia.s Garrett. .But what we.ve seen come out of these exoneration cases and in additional scandals at the laboratories is that this is not a problem of a few bad apples. Who is the competent analyst that can testify about a technique that.s fundamentally unreliable? That.s not a bad-apple problem. That.s a serious problem with our entire system..
At the heart of these criticisms is the issue of what scientists call validity and reliability. A test is valid if its results are factually accurate. A test is reliable if multiple tests will lead to the same conclusion. Some forensics tests, like blood typing, are very reliable: no matter how many times your doctor draws your blood, you will always have the same blood type. Occasionally there are mistakes, of course, but they are predictable: blood-typing tests have well-documented and well-understood error rates. Others, like hair comparison, are unreliable: studies have shown that multiple technicians examining the same two hairs.even the same technician examining the same two hairs at different times.come to multiple conclusions. Critics say that many of forensic science.s most basic tools are neither reliable nor valid.
For example, at the trial of Jimmy Ray Bromgard, who served more than 14 years of a 40-year sentence for sexual intercourse without consent until he was exonerated in 2002, the director of the Montana State Crime Lab told the jury that hairs found on a blanket in the victim.s house .matched. hairs taken from Bromgard.s body. There were so many hairs that matched so well, the analyst said, that there was a .one in 10,000. chance the hairs could have come from anyone else.
But no one has ever established any statistics about the microscopic characteristics of hair, so .one in 10,000. odds isn.t based on scientific consensus. How common is it for a person to have a particular hair color, or for a hair to crinkle or curl just so? Scientists have never answered that question systematically. And what does .match. mean, anyway? There are no uniform guidelines to say how many characteristics two hairs must have in common before they.re said to .match.. It varies entirely from one lab to the next, from one technician to the next.
Barry Fisher, who served as the crime-laboratory director for the Los Angeles Sheriff.s Department for more than 20 years, was often stymied by this problem when he took the stand. .How do you convey the level of certainty?. Fisher asks. .Do you say to the jury, .I.m pretty sure.? .I.m very sure.? What do these things mean?.
To get around this problem, Garrett found, forensics experts too often overreach in their testimony.
When Ray Krone was convicted of murder in Arizona and sentenced to death in 1995, the testimony of a bite-mark analyst was key to the state.s case. .This is really an excellent match,. the analyst said on the stand, comparing Krone.s teeth with a bite mark on the murder victim. .That tooth caused that injury..
In fact, in its report the National Academy of Sciences found that, among all the forensic disciplines, only DNA has proved capable of .individualization..that is, demonstrating .a connection between evidence and a specific individual or source.. When the DNA in the Krone case was tested year later, he was exonerated, but only after spending a decade in The report has led a small but growing number of judges to take a more skeptical approach to forensics. In addition to the Supreme Court case, Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, U.S. District Court Judge Nancy Gertner announced in March that she will allow forensic evidence in her courtroom only if a lawyer first proves in a pretrial hearing that the method is scientifically sound. .In the past, the admissibility of this kind of evidence was effectively presumed, largely because of . the fact that it had been admitted for decades,. Judge Gertner wrote in her order. .The NAS report suggests a different calculus..
The National Institute of Justice has funded some preliminary studies to establish the scientific information that has so far been missing; UCLA.s Mnookin and her colleagues are less than a year into a two-and-a-half-year grant to develop a more formalized and scientifically validated approach to fingerprint analysis. .It.s not that we know that they don.t work,. Mnookin says of fingerprints and other forensic methods. .It.s that we don.t have enough evidence about when they work, how they work, when they might not work.. The report also led to a series of Senate Judiciary Committee hearings. In January Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt. introduced a bill to address some of the major issues in the nation.s forensic system. The The Criminal Justice and Forensic Science Reform Act takes up many of the issues identified in the NAS report. Although the report has gotten a chilly reception from many forensics experts and prosecutors, many others in the field, like Fisher, believe reforms in the system are long overdue.
Geoffrey Mearns, a former federal prosecutor who helped try both Oklahoma City bombers Terry Nichols and Timothy McVeigh, regularly used forensics in his work. Mearns served on the committee that wrote the academy.s report. .I had assumed that there were well-established uniform processes and procedures in place. I really had faith in the accuracy, reliability, and that it was well grounded in science,. says Mearns, now provost and senior vice president for academic affairs at Cleveland State University. .When I realized my faith was not well placed, I was very concerned about the damage that it was doing to the accuracy and efficiency of law-enforcement investigations. Because if the science is not accurate, and is leading us to the wrong person, it.s not only causing a terrible injury to the wrong person, but it.s leading you away from the right The 265 innocent people so far exonerated by DNA are lucky. Among the .hundreds, if not thousands. of people that the Innocence Project.s Peter Neufeld estimates were wrongfully convicted on the basis of faulty forensics, only a small percentage have DNA available to test. What is their recourse? Neufeld says his organization is counseling attorneys to submit a writ of habeas corpus.the legal system.s document of last resort.on the basis of newly discovered evidence: the fact that forensic science is not as scientific as it purported to be at the time of trial. However, .given the reluctance of judges to ever set aside convictions with anything less than DNA,. says Neufeld, .I am not as optimistic as I would like to be despite the fact that there.s a matter of fairness..
One of those exonerated after 15 years in prison was Roy Brown. He was convicted of murder in 1992 and sentenced to 25 years to life, partly on the basis of a bite-mark analyst who said that Brown.s teeth matched a wound on the victim .to a reasonable degree of dental certainty.. The fact that whoever had bitten the victim had six teeth on his upper jaw.the wound clearly had six impressions.whereas Roy Brown had only four was .inconsistent,. the analyst admitted, .but explainably so in my opinion..
DNA proved him innocent in 2006.

@_subject: Assange as the Stainless Steel Rat 
Julian Assange: The Stainless Steel Rat by Mattokunobaka
Going through news stories this morning, I found one that had caught my eye: .Julian Assange to Appear in Court to Appeal. , located at  . Having an interest in the case against Mr Assange, and especially the behavior of the United States towards him, I proceeded to read the report, when a certain passage suddenly leapt out at me.
.Meanwhile a dating site profile from 2007, supposedly created by Assange, had prompted by some lively online debate. The profile on the OKCupid site featured pictures of Assange, though gave the name Harry Harrison . who described himself as a .passionate and often pig- headed activist intellectual. who sought to change the world. He concluded: .Write to me if you are brave.. (emphasis mine).
I went to the site named and saved a screenshot of the page, located at (NOTE: as of 1.30pm today, OKCupid has removed the page from public view, requiring registration to view the page.)
While I was looking over the page, however, it suddenly hit me.I had a major key to his personality and the way his thought processes work. Quite simple, actually.
I.ll refrain from commenting on the case itself at this time, but I can clear up one little mystery: the nom de guerre or username on the OKCupid site. If the site is confirmed as his, as is likely, the pseudonym .Harry Harrison. is entirely reasonable and to be expected, because it confirms that Assange is a fan of science fiction. And it.s a key to the mind of Julian Assange.
The author Harry Harrison wrote a series of science fiction novels about a character named James Bolivar deGriz, alias .Slippery Jim., or .The Stainless Steel Rat.. The original novel was written in 1961; the last was published this year. I have the first five or so novels in my personal library, and they.re great favorites of mine.
deGriz lived in a future which had no crime, no wrongdoing, and was ultimately dull and boring. He refused to be a part of such a boring utopia. Thus he decided to give police something to do, and entertain the people, by performing fantastic feats of theft and other nonviolent crimes, while making the police look like fools. He was wanted by law enforcement across numerous solar systems, as well as by planetary governments, some with a price on his head.
(Sound familiar so far?)
Eventually, he was captured by (and joined) a supersecret intelligence organization, which solved difficult problems concerning societies on different worlds. Subsequent novels followed those assignments and One sees from this admittedly sketchy description of the novels (by memory, I admit) that Julian Assange and Wikileaks serve as the .Stainless Steel Rat. of the present. His .crimes., if any, have been virtually nonviolent, leading .law enforcement. (including the CIA) on a merry chase, while he transmits secret documents from corporations and governments around the world. He has done this successfully for some years It.s evident that he identified intensely with the character of Slippery Jim deGriz from his first reading. Using the alias .Harry Harrison. is therefore a tribute to the writer he idolizes. I don.t believe Harrison himself is aware of this, but the connection seems very clear to me. And yet, as a globetrotter, it.s possible that Julian Assange might have met Harry Harrison, even in disguise.
It.s also apparent to me that he not only determined to be our .Stainless Steel Rat., but that.knowing he couldn.t do it alone.Wikileaks was built around the concept.
Assange, as a hacker, shows the independent, .antisocial. and anarchist nature of deGriz, although his actions ultimately benefit society. Wikileaks (and Assange) have repeatedly thwarted past efforts to contain or stop them. They have repeatedly angered corporations and governments by disseminating information revealing corruption, lies or otherwise embarrassing material. Assange, although an Australian citizen, has no .home. as such, moving from place to place. His support team are volunteers from diverse places. His equipment, funds and supplementary resources are likewise scattered. He has supporters across the world, much like some citizens of the fictional future who idolized James Bolivar Harrison.s deGriz was a master of disguise, and loved thumbing his nose at the cops, performing feats literally under their very eyes. Yesterday, I found this story: Assange attended US embassy party in Iceland at  dated December 13, 2010. It.s worth quoting at length.
By December 2009, Assange had received the US embassy cables, the Iraq war logs, a video of US helicopter pilots mowing down innocent Iraqis, and documents relating to the Afghanistan war, all of which were subsequently published on WikiLeaks.
Although he had already upset the US, Assange was the toast of Iceland at the time of the party, having published a secret report relating to the 2008 collapse of the country.s banks on WikiLeaks.
It was against this background that Assange apparently thought it would be amusing to go into the lion.s den. On the day of the ambassador.s reception, he didn.t even bother to wait for Jonsdottir before heading over to the US embassy.
Jonsdottir explains: .The irony was that I went to collect him from his guesthouse and couldn.t find him, so just went back to work and didn.t even go myself.
.I found out later he.d just decided to go on his own and got in by saying he was my guest. He said he.d spent a long time talking to Mr Watson..
And, at this time, he was already being sought out by the government of the United States.
It would appear that the pattern holds. Assange.s boldness and behavior in this instance would mirror exactly the behavior of the deGriz of science This analysis is only partial and, as I stated, sketchy. I do believe there are enough parallels that it offers an important insight into the mind and personality of Julian Assange.
It.s doubtful that the United States government would be aware of such important connections to understanding their .enemy.. Often political appointees, or even those of the traditional hierarchy, are ignorant of the subjects they are supposed to deal with. And events of the past ten years have confirmed that they do not understand whom they.re fighting very well, even now.
Such was the case with Michael D Brown, of Hurricane Katrina infamy (.Heckuva job, Brownie.), who was appointed head of FEMA under President Bush. He had no qualifications and no experience in Emergency Management. Prior to his assignment, he had been a Commissioner for the International Arabian Horse Association.
I also remember reading a story some time later about a man assigned to head counterterrorism in the FBI. He admitted he knew nothing about Islam, and said something to the extent that it .wasn.t needed. for the job.
It.d seem to me that it.s difficult to fight something you don.t understand. Sun Tzu realized this some thousands of years ago when he wrote .The Art Of War..
If this pattern has continued into the Obama Administration, then, I highly doubt they.ve made the connection I.ve described above. Imagination is not a quality associated with politics, in my opinion. Only fans of science fiction.probably the older ones.would even be aware of Harry Harrison.s novels, as I am.
If I am correct, I believe these are important clues to his personality of Julian Assange and the nature of Wikileaks itself.

Is it possible that our copyright laws could be made even more draconian? So much so that a person could go to prison for five years for the unspeakable crime of embedding a You Tube (  video on their blog or website?
Apparently, the answer is yes ( .
Three Senators want to amend the Copyright Act to make "public performances" of copy-written material a crime, not just a civil tort as it is now. Why is this a problem? Because, as usual, our government is incompetent in matters of technology they don't understand and have written a piece of legislation which would have broad consequences in turning millions of Americans into criminals.
It seems unlikely that we'd see massive prosecutions against every person who shares an "infringing" video on their Facebook account, but that brings up another, perhaps more important point: Laws like this turn all our laws into a joke. There's no longer a stigma against breaking the law but rather simply getting caught. Any time you pass a law which is unenforceable it degrades the integrity of our entire legal system, and when we pass laws this broad which are enforced it's one more step into the pit of tyranny.

@_subject: In brig, WikiLeaks suspect Bradley Manning ordered to sleep 
By Ellen Nakashima
Washington Post Staff Writer
Sunday, March 6, 2011; A08
Military jailers are forcing Bradley Manning, the 23-year-old soldier accused of passing classified documents to WikiLeaks.org, to strip naked in his cell at night and sleep without clothing, a requirement his attorney says was imposed after Manning made a "sarcastic quip" about his For most of the past eight months, Manning has been required to sleep wearing only boxer shorts, because of his status as a detainee under "prevention of injury watch," said 1st Lt. Brian Villiard, a spokesman for the military detention facility, or "brig," in Quantico. Beginning Wednesday night, the facility commander ordered that Manning turn over his boxers, too.
"The intention is not to cause any sort of humiliation or embarrassment," Villiard said. "The intention is to ensure the safety and security of the detainee and make sure he is able to stand trial."
Villiard said he could not explain how Manning might harm himself if he were allowed to keep his underwear, citing rules to protect detainees' privacy. All he could say was that "circumstances warranted" the measure, which was ordered by the brig commander, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Denise Barnes. The requirement will remain in effect until a review next week, he But Manning's attorney, David E. Coombs, said he thought the order was "punitive" under the "guise of being concerned" about Manning's welfare.
In a blog post Saturday, Coombs gave this account of how the boxers were taken away: On Wednesday, Manning was told he would continue to be kept under the restrictions of prevention of injury watch, that there was nothing he could do to change his maximum-custody status and that the brig commander considered him at risk of self-harm. Manning then said that the restrictions were "absurd" and that if he wanted to harm himself using an item of clothing, he could do so "with the elastic waistband of his underwear or with his flip-flops."
Without consulting the facility's mental health provider, the brig commander used Manning's quip as "justification" to increase the restrictions on him, Coombs said. He said Manning was not placed under suicide watch because that would have required a mental health provider's recommendation that the brig commander lacked.
In response to this specific incident, the brig psychiatrist assessed Manning as "low risk," Coombs wrote. In particular, the psychiatrist said that Manning's statement about his underwear waistband was "in no way prompted by 'a psychiatric condition.' "
Villiard did not immediately respond to messages left late Saturday seeking comment on Coombs's claim.
The conditions of Manning's confinement have become controversial, with the United Nations special rapporteur on torture saying he submitted a formal inquiry to the State Department about Manning's treatment. The State Department confirmed Saturday that U.S. officials "have met with the special rapporteur and are preparing a formal response."
Under prevention of injury watch, Manning sleeps on a mattress with a built-in pillow. He has no sheet, only a blanket designed so that it cannot be shredded.
He is in maximum custody, which means he is allowed out of his cell for only one hour each day - to exercise by himself, indoors or outdoors. The maximum-custody designation is based on the seriousness of the alleged offense and the potential length of the sentence, as well as the military's duty to protect him from himself and others, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said last month.
Morrell said he had visited Quantico to observe the conditions of Manning's detention. "I came away enormously impressed by the professionalism of the brig staff and reassured that the manner in which they are housing and treating him is appropriate," he said.
Morrell said that he did not actually speak to Manning but "was just able to see him." He said he was accompanied by Pentagon general counsel Jeh "There's this misperception out there that he is in somehow in solitary confinement, out on his own somewhere in a dark and dreary cell," Morrell said. "That could not be further from the truth."
Coombs said that although Manning is technically not held in solitary confinement, "the cumulative effect of his confinement conditions are tantamount to solitary confinement." He said that there are no other detainees on either side of his cell and that the cell lacks a window or natural light. If Manning tries to speak to others several cells away, "the guards will likely view it as disruptive and require him to stop speaking," he wrote in his blog.
On Friday afternoon, Manning was the only detainee in maximum custody; two other maximum-custody detainees had left that morning, Villiard said.
The jail has 30 cells arranged in a U formation. Though the detainees may talk to one another, the cells are designed so that no detainee has a direct line of sight to another, Villiard said.
On Wednesday, the government denied Manning's request to be removed from maximum custody and prevention of injury watch, said Coombs, who will Villiard said the prevention of injury watch status is reviewed every week with input from mental health providers.
Coombs has asserted that the facility's forensic psychiatrist recommended that the watch be lifted. A separate psychiatrist hired by the defense concurred, he said.

The fact that the FBI chose to prosecute these cases (first Hatfill and then Ivins) in the press and not the courtroom said it all then, and nothing has come out to change the conclusion now: the government was looking for a way to end this investigation at any cost, no matter what - a lot like the Branch Dividian Raid.

It's interesting in how the theories of the video arts community at the time saw the commercialization and democratization of video production much as we saw the creation of networks, protocols, and the all-mighty liberating cryptographic superstructure which would free us all.  In both cases I believe we have become slaves to our saviours, albeit with an improvement of the general welfare.

Resent-From: nettime at kein.org
Resent-To: Nettime notes on the development of the so-called social web and the role of  cyberpunks inside this process
The weakness of cyberpunk was its virtuality, being a complex of  imagery mostly used by writers in fiction, by bloggers in egomany and  by journalists in, well, journalism. What was missing, is a  cyberpunk realism, in the sense of an aesthetics that relates to and  occupies something else than the realms of literature. From this  viewpoint, real existing cyberpunk was the adaption of cyberpunk as a  shiny static representation for what was left of the dynamic of  electronic pioneers, the early computer hackers, and their process of  dissolving their avant-guard status in time and into mass. Comparable  to the punks that were the mass reproduction of the avantgarde  activists before them. The name of this historic forerunner of punk  referred to here, was the Situationist International, a 1950s and 60s  avantgarde group (Read their texts and Greil Marcus history book).  Just like the situationists worked at the fissure between literature  and street, the early real-existing cyberpunks worked at the fissure  of literature and cyberspace. The cyberpunk literature served its  purpose to provide aesthetic naratives some time ago, and in the  ensuing process the real-existing groups that were trying to adapt  these clichis turned into clichis for others to adapt to. A virtual  What constitutes the weakness of the aesthetic force, results in the  weakness as a material force: Cyberpunk made its way on the market of  despiritualized ideas, as the shopping good for the masses. Ever tried  to squat something in Secondlife, like offline punks would do?  Technically impossible. In the process to solve this dilemma,  cyberpunk had to give up integral parts to be able to work on social  topics without a realism and therefore without a political strategy.  Which led to a certain aligning with the social and economical facts  in the process of trying to gain a social impact through the cyberpunk  models. Wondering why Wikileaks doesnt have a wiki anymore? Because  cypherpunk (with ph in this case, refering to those fractions of  cyberpunk that focuse on encryption) was either mass movement or  political tactics of an avant-guard. In deciding to focus on political  manouvres, an open publishing model is not fitting anymore. Contrary  to this, CHAN-culture (imageboards, fast communication channels) and  the ANON-meme (crowd orientated cyber actions) try different ways in  waging real mass-based cyberwars, they reach this point by being more  punk again, punk as in: deviant subculture that parents are afraid of.
Still inside this historic  of cyberpunk, there were hacker  groups and cyberpunk collectives not only representing the literary  images of cyberpunk, but trying to do cyberpunk realism. In the sense  of picking up the punk culture and porting it to the cyberspace.  Working with images and text in the new media, taking it back to the  roots of post-war pre-punk movements, creating free tools, cultural  gifts and mixed artworks, like all the minds from Guy Debord (and many  before), to John Lyndon, to Allen Ginsberg, to Wau Holland, had shown  the way. But working with punk attitude in the 90s and the Zeros  proofs to be a delicate business. Now we can see the last phase of  cyberpunk, the virus has spread, it has dissolved into one of its more  justified aims: the dissolution in non-elitist mass approaches. If you  search today for crazy netpunks, doing the mix with images, ideas and  slogans, fighting cyberwars against scientology and other creepy  institutions, you dont come to the avantgarde collectives, you go the  These collectives had been reaching out to you, flooding you with  texts, movies, songs, images, a vast wave of media. Working all the  time under fake identities to give away anticommodities of a little  countercultureindustry. With that fulfilling the idealist idea of the  free and useful citizens. Only through the nature of these efforts  being collective and collaborative, this theater of autonomy could be  kept running, serving as a good example to all little self-managed  projects out there that with a little circle of friends you can reach  everything you can imagine. Nothing else though. So when the  participants got tired of the shooting in the dark acceleration these  collective products had taken, all the releases, all the  administration, all the fuzz, it went down the spiral of  individualization: moving to a aggregation of solo blogs, then moving  on to the short notes of twitter, a medium only to well fitting for  the self-advertisement. After the autonomous text production of the  last two decades, we face a shift to short notes and images. The DIY  music scene remains a bit unaffected by this, since the hope to become  a money earning musician is still a more powerful cultureindustrial  meme than the one of a writer actually getting paid. The recent  shifting from myspace to facebook shows although, that  everyone-is-an-artist wasnt a powerful enough idea. It had to be  self-representation, mini-blogging, star-cult, focus on images and  other spectacular media instead of text: The hyperindividualist  self-representation platform of facebook suited the masses best.
For large parts, this big network is filled with representations of  static faces. Faces, that are amongst our most subliminal ways of  communicating, become our fastest and most plain way of making a  statement. Update profile picture, comment, like, like back, update  again. The collectivization of communication (lat. communicare = do  sth. together) failed, in fact this means the failure of mass art.  Todays market of representations means that we exchange images that  are valued by statements without consequence, statements whose only  value is the one of attention, something we have learned from the  advertising process, which has become the key process of culture. This  cultural praxis fails to find a history of the human faces. The faces  tried to break the boundaries of word and image, they were processes  of conscious creation of speaking images for the feelings that words  fail to describe. The times of boredom that everyone wanders now,  through images that dont form related stories anymore, are a result  of loosing our dream of creating non-static post-representative  playful expressions. To associate the fragile idea of friendship still  with the formalized and online media based networks of friends is  the dramatic deception that covers this loss. It was the fragile  nature of friendship itself that was lost, that what made  communication between friends comfortable. The need to be near to  others and to be free on ones own at the same time, was dissolved into  the mode of being present to each other only through distance. The  tools of social media cover up the failure of the social itself.  Giving up the idea of the possibility of social relations in which one  can give each other the comfort of being together and granting all  freedom the same time, is a failure whose results may be not so easy  to cover. This is not a judgment about the idea of mass communication  per se, but about the idea and modes of social media networks.
Coming back to the crews for once: the game of creating a strong  collective representation that immediately represents itself was  programmed to fail in a society that only uses representations to mark  the value of exchangeability. The punk image of a cybergang that  somehow evades the mainstream norms and holds up the, now  conservative, ideas of elite and underground was the joke that had to  choke itself. It was working with the idea of an everchanging  collective project that would remain the same all the time in order to  avoid to spoil the fans. This planned contradiction of the ultimate  hype was not scandalous anymore when the whole web turned to the  noncontradictive targeted creation of hypes. What these groups had  caricatured since decades was only about to become the online model of  creating static ideas that represent dynamic change. The cybergangs  were constructed never to end, because as a project, a channel, it was  not aiming for something and therefore it couldnt fail. Other media  collectives of today, opposed to this, want to start because they  realize that pictured dynamics has to be the key feature of a  successful industrial media product.
So from this learning process we gain the perspective of boringness.  Being a progressive participant of cyberspace today is not about being  elite and surfing the most underground hubs. Its about surfing on the  top of it all, on the big normal junkyard of human creation and  picking up the inspirations together. Its also about reading a book  again, following an authors thought through 400 pages instead of 140  letters. And also in the same sense: doing a website again, a static  thing that waits for hundreds to come by, just like a book in the  library, instead of giving daily updates to attract some other  thousands that need their daily fix of info. Some books still are more  actual than the daily news reports (when these were still existing,  now the news must be updated all the time). And maybe the lost dreams  in these books need an actualisation through a website, instead of  just a quotation in the fast streams of actualities. Its about  refusing the entertainment, its about finding enlightment in thought  processes themselves and not in what forms they have been given for  representation. Its about picking up something dead and giving it  life instead of living the perpetual death of the bubble of statements.
The non-conformism of today is a real challenge: To deal with  something beyond the instantaneous satisfaction of a pseudodynamic  static image. The progressive illustrations, thoughts, projects and  processes will need you to stumble over them, to search for them, to  look closely or even stare at them (not like you stared at the TV  since 50 years ago, at youtube since 5 years ago). It needs you to  stop worrying about the central hub, website or plattform that you  feel like home in. It needs you to stop worrying about any rss-feeds  that you only used to feed your identity out of angst in this process  of identification, representation and individualisation. Not to learn  even more exiting ways of being alone  you can easily find those in  the entertainment industry  but to pick up again the idea of  communication. Surf around, take off from time to time and play with  what and whom you might find.

Not at all.  All that would be required is traffic duplication from less than a dozen (less than half a dozen at that time) backbones.  Easily doable technically, and from their bugetary perspective.
I think at least one of us is misremembering :-)
This is a processing issue, not a collection issue.  Collection of 100% of the internet traffic is easily achieved, and we should all assume that it has in fact *been* achieved for close to a decade now.  Processing that collection was the big issue, and likely still is - although, great advances have been made in automated language recognition. Anyone who doubts that should forget about Dragon, and just go look at a new cell phone: I have ~600 entries in my address book, and although the phone has no ability to refine it's interpretations based upon prior failures/sucesses, it still gets my verbal dial requests correct roughly 85% of the time.  Heuristic systems should be doing some *fabulous* automated processing at this stage of the game.

"Yes, we can!" was his rallying cry: Yes, we CAN throw fiscally irresponsible scumbags who caused the financial melt down in prison!  Yes we CAN help out Main Street before Wall street!  Yes we CAN end all of these insane wars (the fact that that these wars are ALL illegal doesn't faze him in the least).
Well, prosecution meant giving TARP loans and other financial bailouts; Main Street is being hit with horrific cutbacks across the boards, as well as the virtual dismantling of Medicare and Medicaid; Wall Street *STILL* runs the show! Tim Geither is one of the main Wall Streeters who *CAUSED* the meltdown, yet he's been put in charge of running the economy in recognition of his "fine" and "outstanding" work creating this mess in the first place!

@_subject: There.s a Secret Patriot Act, Senator Says 
You may think you understand how the Patriot Act allows the government to spy on its citizens. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) says it.s worse than you.ve Congress is set to reauthorize three controversial provisions of the surveillance law as early as Thursday. But Wyden says that what Congress will renew is a mere fig leaf for a far broader legal interpretation of the Patriot Act that the government keeps to itself . entirely in secret. Worse, there are hints that the government uses this secret interpretation to gather what one Patriot-watcher calls a .dragnet. for massive amounts of information on private citizens; the government portrays its data-collection efforts much differently.
.We.re getting to a gap between what the public thinks the law says and what the American government secretly thinks the law says,. Wyden tells Danger Room in an interview in his Senate office. .When you.ve got that kind of a gap, you.re going to have a problem on your hands..
What exactly does Wyden mean by that? As a member of the intelligence committee, he laments that he can.t precisely explain without disclosing classified information. But one component of the Patriot Act in particular gives him immense pause: the so-called .business-records provision,. which empowers the FBI to get businesses, medical offices, banks and other organizations to turn over any .tangible things. it deems relevant to a security investigation.
.It is fair to say that the business-records provision is a part of the Patriot Act that I am extremely interested in reforming,. Wyden says. .I know a fair amount about how it.s interpreted, and I am going to keep pushing, as I have, to get more information about how the Patriot Act is being interpreted declassified. I think the public has a right to public debate about it..
That.s why Wyden and his colleague Sen. Mark Udall offered an amendment on Tuesday to the Patriot Act reauthorization.
The amendment, first reported by Marcy Wheeler, blasts the administration for .secretly reinterpret[ing] public laws and statutes.. It would compel the Attorney General to .publicly disclose the United States Government.s official interpretation of the USA Patriot Act.. And, intriguingly, it refers to .intelligence-collection authorities. embedded in the Patriot Act that the administration briefed the Senate about in February.
Wyden says he .can.t answer. any specific questions about how the government thinks it can use the Patriot Act. That would risk revealing classified information . something Wyden considers an abuse of government secrecy. He believes the techniques themselves should stay secret, but the rationale for using their legal use under Patriot ought to be disclosed.
.I draw a sharp line between the secret interpretation of the law, which I believe is a growing problem, and protecting operations and methods in the intelligence area, which have to be protected,. he says.
Surveillance under the business-records provisions has recently spiked. The Justice Department.s official disclosure on its use of the Patriot Act, delivered to Congress in April, reported that the government asked the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for approval to collect business records 96 times in 2010 . up from just 21 requests the year before. The court didn.t reject a single request. But it .modified. those requests 43 times, indicating to some Patriot-watchers that a broadening of the provision is underway.
.The FISA Court is a pretty permissive body, so that suggests something novel or particularly aggressive, not just in volume, but in the nature of the request,. says Michelle Richardson, the ACLU.s resident Patriot Act lobbyist. .No one has tipped their hand on this in the slightest. But we.ve come to the conclusion that this is some kind of bulk collection. It wouldn.t be surprising to me if it.s some kind of internet or communication-records dragnet.. (Full disclosure: My fiancie works for the The FBI deferred comment on any secret interpretation of the Patriot Act to the Justice Department. The Justice Department said it wouldn.t have any comment beyond a bit of March congressional testimony from its top national security official, Todd Hinnen, who presented the type of material collected as far more individualized and specific: .driver.s license records, hotel records, car-rental records, apartment-leasing records, credit card records, and the like..
But that.s not what Udall sees. He warned in a Tuesday statement about the government.s .unfettered. access to bulk citizen data, like .a cellphone company.s phone records.. In a Senate floor speech on Tuesday, Udall urged Congress to restrict the Patriot Act.s business-records seizures to .terrorism investigations. . something the ostensible counterterrorism measure has never required in its nearly 10-year existence.
Indeed, Hinnen allowed himself an out in his March testimony, saying that the business-record provision .also. enabled .important and highly sensitive intelligence-collection operations. to take place. Wheeler speculates those operations include .using geolocation data from cellphones to collect information on the whereabouts of Americans. . something our sister blog Threat Level has reported on extensively.
It.s worth noting that Wyden is pushing a bill providing greater privacy protections for geolocation info.
For now, Wyden.s considering his options ahead of the Patriot Act vote on Thursday. He wants to compel as much disclosure as he can on the secret interpretation, arguing that a shadow broadening of the Patriot Act sets a dangerous precedent.
.I.m talking about instances where the government is relying on secret interpretations of what the law says without telling the public what those interpretations are,. Wyden says, .and the reliance on secret interpretations of the law is growing..

THE FRENCH BOMB, WITH SECRET U.S. HELP
Documents from Nixon and Ford Administrations Show U.S. Assistance for French Nuclear Forces Earlier Than Previously Reported
Kissinger Sought to make French "Drool" for Nuclear Aid
For more information contact:
William Burr - 202/994-7000
wburr at gwu.edu
Washington, D.C., May 26, 2011 - The U.S. government secretly helped France develop its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program, and much earlier than previously realized, according to declassified documents compiled and edited by National Security Archive senior analyst William Burr and published jointly with the Nuclear Proliferation International History Project, an Archive partner.
Over twenty years ago, Princeton University political scientist Richard Ullman revealed the existence of this program in a headline-making article, "The Covert French Connection," published in Foreign Policy magazine. Drawing upon interviews with former officials, Ullman disclosed that the Nixon administration, believing that a more effective French nuclear force was in the U.S. interest, began a secret program in 1973 of information sharing on ballistic missiles, nuclear weapons technology, and nuclear weapons safety, which continued into the Ford administration and beyond. The documents published today move the timeline earlier, to 1970-71.
Ullman's most sensational revelation was that U.S. government officials had circumvented atomic energy laws by providing the French with indirect assistance to their nuclear weapons program. Through "negative guidance," Washington indirectly--20-questions style--helped the French perfect their nuclear warheads. Today's publication fills out, and goes beyond the record established by Ullman. Declassified documents indicate that:
* The French made the first move in December 1969, earlier than Ullman's sources had indicated, when the Armaments Ministry asked the Pentagon for assistance with the ballistic missile program.
* A key moment was a February 1970 meeting between President Nixon and French president Georges Pompidou when the two tacitly agreed on the possibility of "nuclear cooperation" which led Nixon to make a "decision to be forthcoming" to French requests.
* Reflecting internal controversy within the U.S. government, in 1971 the Nixon administration made a decision on "minimal" aid: besides assistance with nuclear safety and computer exports, the United States would help France improve the reliability of existing missiles, but not develop new ones.
* The French valued U.S. assistance on ballistic missile technology (propulsion, quality control, reliability), but during 1972 and early 1973 they stepped up pressure for more information, including warhead miniaturization and "physics package" and submarine-launched ballistic missile technology, so they could move into the "next generation" of ballistic missiles.
* To make France's case for more advanced technology, during mid-1973 defense minister Robert Galley met secretly twice with senior U.S. officials, including national security adviser Henry Kissinger and Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger.
* A key issue in these discussions was the possibility of "negative guidance" which Kissinger said would allow Washington to "critique what you are doing. We can say, 'That's the wrong way.'"
* Seeking to manipulate France for his European diplomacy, Kissinger wanted to whet Galley's appetite for more information--to make him "drool"--but "negative guidance" was controversial and it is not clear when it actually became available.
* In June 1975, President Gerald Ford, continuing Nixon's efforts to improve relations with Paris, updated the 1971 guidance by authorizing aid to decrease the vulnerability of French missiles, including reentry vehicles and missile hardening and information on multiple reentry vehicle technology.

After going through an exhaustive process of taking their case to domestic courts, and consistently losing their case, Pennie and Kevin finally took their case to the European Court of Human Rights . where they won and Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 was declared illegal.

Ayesha Kazmi: Can you tell me what powers the police exercised in order to stop you at the protest?
Pennie Quinton: I was stopped and searched when covering the arms fair protests at the Excel centre 2003. The area came under a section 44 jurisdiction but there was also a section 60 in place. The police can put a S60 in place if they suspect that there is going to be violence. That week during the protests I was stopped under a variety of acts, I was really being harassed. I was stopped under PACE, I was stopped under S 60, and I was stopped under section 44.
AK: Can you describe what happened that day?

The irony is some of the delegates attending were on the governments. .terrorist wanted list. but they'd been given an amnesty to come and buy weapons as they were going to be spending huge amounts of money. During the protests, the police acknowledged there were people they actually wanted inside the Excel centre, but were not allowed to touch them. Overseas terrorist organisations were present, .but we don't want to get in the way of the market.. I think there were some quite ironic pieces written at the time about this. Liberty were concerned that S44 was being used to police protests, rather than for what the act was intended for. They had actually put some of their lawyers at the demonstration because of this.
AK: Why were you there that day and what happened to you?
PQ: I had my camera, and the police had cordoned off a section near the excel centre, I had a feeling that something was going to happen. I've got quite a good instinct and I walked, quite a long way around the police cordon and onto the dual carriageway that runs alongside the Excel and as I walked up the embankment I saw all these young people running as fast as they could they could towards the Excel centre they were being pursued by quite a big burly policeman and some plain clothes officers. They were then pulled to the ground and were sat on by the police officers so that's what I wanted to get footage of, right? As I walked up the embankment with my camera, trying to film this; a WPC walked up to me and she just said; .what's your name?. I gave her my press card that.s the first thing I did, as I wanted to carry on filming. She then said, come with me. I said; .well I'm filming.. I wanted my card, so she made me wait and stand by other detained people sitting on the ground. I was kept waiting fifteen minutes. She asked me to stop filming so I was unable to film the arrests. I put the lens cap on but carried on recording sound after fifteen minutes she took my camera and turned it off. During this wait she said .I.m going to search you under section 44 of the terrorism act.. Which is on the recording. The police logged the search as lasting 5 minutes, but my footage alone is 15 minutes, so this disproves that. In the case; one of the violations of my privacy was the WPC taking my camera and turning it off which in my specific case, didn't really do very well at the county court because the question was framed to the jury such as .do you believe that it was a violation of Pennie Quinton.s privacy that her camera was taken and turned off?. And the jury voted almost unanimously no. Then in Kevin Gillan.s case: .do you believe it was a violation of Kevin Gillan.s privacy that the police confiscated his notes and his research?. And again the jury voted no so we completely lost in the domestic courts. When we got to Strasbourg the McPherson report had just come out and they(the judges expressed concern about the high number of stop and searches of black and Asian youth under S44). So our case was actually there demonstrating the misuse of this law. My case definitely showed that the law was being misused; the police officer did not have to suspect that I was a terrorist but using the power I could be prevented from filming, prevented from as it were covering the police actions on that day an example of how the law was being misused. It wasn't being used because they thought I was a terrorist, it was being used because they thought I was a journalist. In the same way, I don't think that the police think a fourteen-year-old kid who.s on his way home from school who may be a bit leery is a terrorist. They think: .I can use this to stop him and he might have something that.s incriminating..
AK: Can you tell me more about Kevin and your case?
PQ: It wasn't really about Kevin and I. The case was particularly about the fact that the law was shaky; being able to be stopped and searched for no reason. It wasn't because what had happened to us was particularly extreme. The point was to demonstrate that this law doesn't have enough guidelines and can be used in ways the police choose but not for the reason the power was intended, and that was what the challenge was about. S44 gives the police too much freedom and too much opportunity to abuse this power. It cannot be challenged if the police stop and search someone under section 44; it.s very difficult to challenge a police officer. The WPC that stopped and searched me, in court, said she couldn.t remember [the stop and search]. She basically gave a no comment interview, she couldn't remember the incident and that doesn't matter, it doesn't matter that she couldn't remember, because the law gave her the power to stop and search for no reason, because there was no reason it didn't matter, she could just stop and search me. There doesn't have to be a reason, it.s completely arbitrary. Initially the whole thing went to the House of Lords where Lord Bingham ruled the use of the power against us wasn't a violation of privacy and that if we had any actual issue with the way that the stop and search was carried out we should seek remedy in the lower courts. We had to exhaust domestic remedy before we could take the case to Strasbourg, after we losing at the House of Lords.
AK: Didn.t the police officer have to fill out a form as procedure?
PQ: The worrying thing is that the government wants to take away that process. So it.s going to be more difficult to monitor how many stops and searches take place. The conservatives want to take away the receipts people receive when they are stopped and searched, and that is really worrying. It.s as if the incident didn.t happen, as the person won.t be able to prove they had been searched.
AK: What do you think the purpose of Section 44 of the Terrorism Act is?
PQ: When section 44 was started it was trialled in protest situations. So the first people to complain of S44 being used against them, and were protesters back in 2003 during the protests about the Iraq war. I don't know how much it was used before 2003, but we first became aware of it as protesters around 2003. I was covering protests, and it was mainly people who were covering protests that were being stopped, people that were filming, people that were photographing.
AK: What makes Section 44 different from other stop and search powers? And how is it different from Section 43 of the Terrorism Act?
PQ: The difference with this stop and search power is that the police don.t have to have any suspicion that's the main thing. The problem with this is that they are able to just search for no reason. That's what was exceptional about this power. It meant that they didn't have to suspect that someone of carrying a weapon; they even didn't have to suspect someone of being a terrorist, they didn't have to suspect anything. They could just stop anyone under this legislation once the order was in place. Section 43 is with suspicion and is a different stop and search power to S44. Section 44 applied to vehicles and pedestrians. Section 43 is a suspicion clause, section 44 still remains in place for the stopping and searching of vehicles. For Section 43 a police officer must have suspicion that this person is a terrorist, or might connected to an act of terrorism and that's the difference to S 44, where there doesn.t need to be any suspicion. Other search powers are broader than S 44. There is a range of powers. Maybe S60.s are used near nightclubs, or PACE, (the Police and Criminal Evidence Act), if police suspect something. In the case of repeated searches of black and Asian youth most people in the black community don't want to make a case, I have heard some people say if they made a complaint every time they were stopped and searched, they.d never leave the police station.The targeting of certain communities is very high and I think that mothers are very afraid for their sons; you know what can happen because things can escalate very quickly. I remember there was a protest outside Lambeth town hall relating to Derek Bennett; a man shot by police in Brixton. He was shot six times in the back, the police suspected he had a gun he had no gun. The only thing he had on him was a cigarette lighter. There was a protest outside Lambeth town hall led by the youth and I went along to get some photographs. I.d not covered a protest led by the Afro-Caribbean community before. It was about 50 or so Kids about 14 years old and some older women. The men from the community didn't seem to really want to take part. I remember we went past them and they just looked at us and went oh, yeah it.s just some kids. We marched down Brixton Road and we marched up to the place where Derek Bennett was killed off of the Brixton Road, and his sister gave a speech. Then the police said, everyone this way, but the kids said, .no we.re not doing what you want.. And they marched in the opposite direction to another street. Suddenly there were six or seven riot vans, tactical support group vans, and the police were immediately ready with their shields pushing everyone around, kids and women. I just thought it was going to be a little community protest so I.d actually got my shopping . I.d just been Christmas shopping. The police were pushing us with their shields; they were throwing people to the ground. It was really a complete overreaction, so I think that's the problem it really does come back to that as an institution the police force are racist.
AK: In what ways do you feel that stop and search powers can be abused?
PQ: The difference is that the photographer can put down their camera. A photographer is more likely to be known by the police if they cover demonstrations and there may perhaps be a relationship with the police as well, not necessarily a friendly one, but the police will know them.They might have photographed the police doing something wrong and that might have led to bad publicity for the police. So the police have a direct interest in stopping a photographer from doing their work because the police don't want to be made to look bad. There is that dynamic, that paranoia has spread to private security firms, because the police have circulated guidelines. If a photographer is taking photographs of buildings police have advised security guards to stop them, but they don.t have the power to stop anybody taking a photographs of something in the public domain such as a building. A lot of police interference preventing photographers from taking pictures using the terrorism act is actually bad policing. There is a prejudice there, but it.s not the same as if you happen to be Bengali, Pakistani, moving through London, where your chances of being stopped are very high. There are specific times when photographers are targeted maybe when they are covering demonstrations or at a high profile event, but a black or Asian youth are stopped more at any time. S44 is disproportionately and routinely used against a huge section of the population. And the police have negative association with blacks and Asians searches will increase when there is an incident; like 7/7. And at that point, politicians are under huge pressure to do something now and this can lead to scapegoating, .we've got to do something now., syndrome, everyone starts buck-passing. Even if the intelligence services did know something was going to happen, obviously they messed up because something happened they were unable to prevent. There have been no arrests related to a section 44 stop that led to charges. So some people were been arrested in a situation that started with a section 44 stop, but all were released without charges. It has not been an effective power at all while impacting on our freedom of assembly, freedom of movement, and right to privacy.
AK: Why do you feel that stop and search powers are necessary?
PQ: In every country where you have a suspect population, forces whether they're the army or a police force, suspect boys from about the age of 13 till about 24,because this age group are more unfixed in society, they're not really positioned anywhere. They're in that kind of limbo between childhood and adulthood I live above a kind of car park. A bunch of lads use to hang out in they don't really have anything to do. But they.re very noisy and they're very aggressive with each other and its loud and I think people feel threatened by that. But actually, that's just what happens with men at that age. They very often hang out in a group and it.s considered suspicious. They're often bored or something, I don't know, you can go anywhere in the world and a see a gang of boys of that age with nothing to do, sitting around. It.s just what it is. It.s just what happens you can.t just stop and search them because they're young, and you've got the added suspicion in the police eyes, .Oh they're a bit brown, or foreign, or Irish.. It would be interesting to see if the Irish community are still being quite targeted.
AK: Do you believe that stop and search is used disproportionately toward minority populations?
PQ: I think so. I remember the Daily Mail.s outrage that the police thought, they were going to get done for racism so, according to the Daily Mail, began searching .innocent. white people. The Daily Mail is really the essence of such attitudes. I.d like it if someone took a case against the Daily Mail under the Race Relations Act.

No.  What I mean is "we all": anyone who looks can see.  I don't know anyone [personally] who voted for Obama (and implicitly for his "change platform of closing Gitmo; ending the wars; ending renditions; looking out for the little guy over the big corporations; the so-called "no lobbyists" policy - which he has ignored completely; etc.) who is not completely *disgusted* by what has happened: we voted for "change", and what we got was a spineless version of GWB, only he's a GWB with *more* wars to his name, and ZERO change.
Obama had a genuine mandate when he took office (with a majority in both houses!), and should have used that mandate to effect the changes he ran on - but instead, he dallied and wavered until he eventually cost his party their majorities, and cost himself credibility.  How can anyone take *anything* Obama says seriously, when we have already been shown (repeatedly) that he is little more than a serial liar who is completely, *100%* OWNED, by the very corporations and special interests he campaigned Now he's trying to abolish the 2ad by using a treaty which even KKKlinton refused to touch - selling it under the false premise that it is the only way to stop the flow of weapons from the US to Mexico.  Just because Mexico is farther down the corruption highway than we are doesn't mean that we should be making fundamental changes to our country just to make it easier for them!
Obama is a failure.  He's been a failure from day 1.  He's a spineless POS, and an embarrassment to the country.  McCain was at least honest about his policy positions (yay for big business, to hell with the little guy): Obama is a hypocrite. Which is worse? Hard to say, really.
We need 3rd party representation, and I'm NOT talking about the Teabaggers, I'm talking about a Kucinich or Ron Paul candidacy which is allowed to be shown to the country via the debate process (the last 4 election cycles have deliberately blocked these two from any meaningful participation.  Not that I don't understand why: if allowed to speak freely, openly, and to the masses, they both would have a very serious shot at unseating the RepubliCrat machine (which pushes the same platforms from both of the "mainstream parties" - one party rule has never worked in any [supposedly] democratic society - it's not working here either).

The Trouble With E-Mail
By VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN
Among Internet users with secrets, including bankers, lawyers, hackers and people who visit porn sites or confide in friends . so that would be all of us . there.s a widespread apprehension that the Web is no longer a safe place to spill them.
You can see that wariness in e-mail, which for years has been considered a spontaneous and freewheeling form, better known for gaffes and rants than anxiety and circumspection. As recently as 2008, Will Schwalbe and David Shipley described e-mailers as inveterate hotheads in their manual .Send..
.On e-mail, people aren.t quite themselves,. they wrote. .They are angrier, less sympathetic, less aware, more easily wounded, even more gossipy and duplicitous..
Oh, how times have changed. The idea that e-mail is chiefly a conduit for anger and lies seems almost quaint. After too may careers ruined and personal lives upended by online indiscretions, it should now be crystal clear that there are some things one must never, ever commit to e-mail.
And that.s why some bankers developed .LDL.. .LDL. . which means .let.s discuss live. . is an acronym that surfaced during the S.E.C..s investigation of Goldman Sachs for its role in the nation.s financial shame spiral. How do the pros use it? Goldman.s Jonathan Egol is the first known master. When a trader named Fabrice Tourre described a mortgage investment in e-mail as .a way to distribute junk that nobody was dumb enough to take first time around,. Egol shot back: .LDL..
See how that works? Wanna talk about junky mortgages? Let.s get off the % Internet.
It works with other topics, too. Problems at home? LDL. State secrets about Egypt? LDL. How much you paid for your house? LDL.
.LDL. and its equivalents . tonal inversions of the carefree LOLs of e-mail past . are the most succinct ways Internet-users now express the desire to ditch the Web and seek analog pastures. And as much as the banker chat that was revealed in e-mail seems galling, it.s the rare Web-user who.d willingly submit his own e-mail archive to prosecutorial scrutiny. LDL, for those who have the option, is an extremely good idea. Nearly everyone needs some form of communication that.s not searchable, archivable, forwardable, discoverable and permanent. Of course, the longing for more in-person exchange is also part of the broader nostalgia a time before the Internet, when copyright and privacy seemed enforceable, and traditional business models obtained.
These grander sentiments were on theatrical display scale last week at eG8, the Internet-themed prelude to the G8 conference in France. Both conferences, like other jetset global conferences, are the very definition of LDL, existing solely to facilitate actual, physical elbow-rubbing among human beings like Jimmy Wales, Rupert Murdoch and Mark Zuckerberg.
At eG8, McKinsey submitted eye-popping research that showed that Internet-related consumption and expenditure in the G8 nations is now bigger than agriculture or energy. As if freshly aware of this economic monster, scores of high-profile global lawmakers, including Nicolas Sarkozy, the president of France, then spoke of the Internet as wilderness that they intended to colonize with official government overseers.
But it.s not just French rhetoricians, using the language of the 19th century, to whom the Internet of today seems dangerously anarchic. Bloggers and others now chronicle their breaks from the Internet, periods of withdrawal from electronic communication. They also tighten privacy settings; they close Facebook pages. Their e-mails, texts and IMs become more pro forma and less expressive.
It.s been a year since the arrest of Bradley Manning, the army intelligence analyst who is believed to have yanked thousands of documents off the government.s Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, or SIPRNet. Manning passed those documents on to WikiLeaks using Tor Hidden Services, a secure network that protects users from surveillance and traffic analysis. WikiLeaks started to publish them. And then Manning appears to have described his feat in an online chat with a hacker named Adrian Lamo, who turned him in.
To many observers, the lesson of WikiLeaks was not about Turkey or Saudi Arabia or national security. It.s that no one.s online communication . not the government.s Secret Internet Protocol, not Bradley Manning.s hacker chatroom . is secure. WikiLeaks has become a kind of Ruby Ridge for some Web users: an event that crystallized the perception that the Internet is embattled and that spies are everywhere.
Suddenly it seems, as they used to say in Tintin comics, these walls have I see how this happened, but I can.t help but remember the day I became 73773.143 at compuserve.com. It was 1993, and I.d clearly lucked into a good address . highly memorable with all those 7s and 3s. (That same year, President Clinton became 75300.3115 at compuserve.com.)
With e-mail, my inhibitions about traditional conversation fell away: there was no blushing or lisping or stuttering on e-mail. If traditionalists who disdained typing or excelled at office banter felt left out by electronic communication, millions of other personalities were brought to life by it. In the early 1990s there were some 15 million e-mail accounts worldwide. By the end of 1999 there were 569 million. Today there are more than 3 billion.
E-mail, then, c.est nous. But we can.t say no one warned us. We.ve all seen too many crises, personal and public, not to know that e-mail is not a place for secrets.
Note: The reference to Bradley Manning has been adjusted to indicate that he is only under suspicion of having disclosed diplomatic cables and intelligence reports.

I recently had a discussion with my kids: I was trying to apologize for my part in making the current worl what it has become today.  Having been at the beginning of microprocessing, crypto, etc., I (we?) all thought we were changing the world for the better - i.e., we would use these efforts to leave the world a better place than when we found it.  But that hasn't just been a false belief, it's been a self-inflicted lie.

What I find incredibly myopic is the assumption that terrorists and other "bad actors" are likely to ue the services mentioned to facilitate their acts, whether good, bad, or fantasy.  I doubt that the targets are actually the proposed "bad actors" mentioned in the RFP, but believe that it is Joe Sixpack, Jane Minorcriminal, and John Protester who are the actual points of interest of the FBI and its [few, and all lettered] If we are really interested in bad actors of the classes suggested here, I think it's pretty much universally agreed that HUMINT is the standard bearer, and will remain so for the foreeable future - unless there is also some "plan" to have HUMINT tranliterated into Facebook and Twitter feeds, specifically to enable this kind of automated processing to proceed apace (*highly* doubtful, as such a plan would by definition require what is effectively a "public disclosure" of likely classified data streams from the various HUMINT sources).

Boffins pull off room-temp quantum computing with home-grown gems
Diamond test gives hope to luke-warm server strokers
By Brid-Aine Parnell . Get more from this author

Free whitepaper . Enabling Datacenter and Cloud Service Management for Mid-Tier Enterprises
One of the very many reasons there won't be quantum computing any time soon is that the quantum bits (qubits) need to be at absolute zero - not very practical for the average server room, much less the lowly desktop.
However, Harvard tech boffins have come up with a way to create a qubit in a solid-state system at room temperature that can store information for nearly two seconds, an increase of around six orders of magnitude over the lifespan of earlier systems.
Problem solved. Except for one tiny issue: to do it, the researchers had to use diamonds. (The gems were lab-grown, so they didn't have to use the world's finite supply of naturally occurring diamonds . but still, building a computer out of diamonds is surely not going to be easy, is "We have a qubit at room temperature that we can measure with very high efficiency and fidelity. We can encode data in it, and we can store it for a relatively long time," professor of physics Mikhail Lukin (pictured on the left) said in a canned statement.
Scientists figured out a couple of years ago that atomic-scale impurities in lab-grown diamonds called nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres behave like single atoms, having a spin that can be polarised. With the help of lasers, they can control that spin and figure out its orientation. But it wasn't yet an idea they tried out with qubits because they can only hold data for around a millionth of a second before their quantum properties drop out.
The Harvard boffins figured out that the NV centres would mirror carbon-13 atoms, which are also in the diamonds. So they could put the info in a carbon-13 atom and monitor the NV centre to "read" the data. Whenever they don't want the NV centre to read the atom, they use massive amounts of laser light to keep it occupied.
They can also hit the diamond with radio frequency pulses to suppress interaction between the carbon-13 isotope and other atoms in order to extend the life of the qubit.
"We believe this work is limited only by technical issues, so it looks feasible to increase the life span into the range of hours. At that point, a host of real-world applications become possible," Lukin said.
The boffins foresee the system being used for paying for stuff (not the diamond bit, the computer bit); in highly secure networks . where it would be used for transmitting data; and for building quantum computers, natch.
The study was published in Science. .

Sent: Wednesday, July 11, 2012 8:05 AM
Yesterday the Seattle Police Department's SWAT team, rammed open an apartment door in the CD at 5:45 a.m., threw in two flash grenades which woke up the neighborhood and the four residents of the apartment, and with assault rifles served a warrant for some articles of clothing and "anarchist" reading materials.  The took a few articles of clothing like a sweater, blue cap, bandana, and some reading material and left.  No charges, no arrests.  They said it was related to May 1st.  This was a raid that violates the ethical and moral standards of the community.  See the Stranger's blog for more details.  There was a demonstration against this behavior last night, and there is a larger one planned for this Friday at 7:00 p.m.  The rally began at Westlake last night, and most likely will begin there this Friday also.
I am passing this timely information along below.  Please feel free to do the same...
A Seattle activist is in Minneapolis and has advice from two of the RNC 8 who were arrested & charged with conspiracy around the anti-RNC plans in One of them has extensive experience with community-oriented support campaigns for people facing grand juries & criminal cases for political stuff and was heavily involved Cece MacDonald's case.  The following you may already know or may be helpful.
With regards to security it was advised that sometimes people can do more harm than good by not sharing essential info with their community when the police already have access to that anyway.  In particular it was advised all this information can be sent over email.
It is suggested getting lawyers, but stresses that it's important to keep folks involved so that lawyers can't control the situation.
This is now an opportunity to lay groundwork for a defense campaign for the possibility someone is arrested or charged.  In particular we can use this as an opportunity to start doing know-your-rights trainings, including some specific to grand juries.
Also, we have time to plan in a way that allows us to have more control over the public narrative in that case.
On that note, it's important to not isolate ourselves and seek/appreciate support wherever it's available, but to also do as much as possible to control the narrative of any support campaign, i.e., to counter narratives of innocent vs. guilty or "they were just exercising their first amendment rights" stuff.
As an example, we should not present ourselves as "just peace activists" if we are in fact revolutionaries.  Revolutionaries can lose support from liberals and progressives if we're not straighforward about our politics. Don't water down the type of organizing and political work that you're doing.  Liberals should support radicals and revolutionaries because anyone involved in organizing deserves support when the cops/feds come after them. It shouldn't be based on claims that the work they're doing is compatible with capitalist democracy if that's not actually the case.  Don't say anything to the media or community that can't stand up in court.
Grand Juries: it's essential to have an across-the-board policy of non-cooperation with grand juries: Refuse to answer ANY of their questions. Some people think they can outsmart grand juries, but they are fishing expeditions and even minor-seeming information can help them.  There have been cases where every single person refused to testify.  As a result no one was found in contempt of court for not answering questions.
Preferred website with lots of useful grand jury info.  Kris Hermes, who runs it.   We should publicly announce this site whenever the feds talk to someone or approach us at all.  If the feds aren't seeking media attention a la "perp walks" then that means they don't want it; it's better to draw community/media attention so that people don't feel isolated if/when it happens to them.
Media work is really important, again to get as wide of support as Links to more info:
With degrees of variation, pretty much everyone who does various legal
support training (know your rights etc.) across the country uses ordraws
heavily from midnight special material:   This is the last version of a Minneapolis zine; some of it is outdated or
specific to mpls, but a lot of it continues to be relevant:
Commonly used zine:
Good general security culture zine:
You may not agree with the overall analysis, but it is useful nevertheless:
Sign at last night's demo:  "First they came for the hoodies, ..."  (BTW, an

National Call-in Day for Move To Amend on June 29
The Senate Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights, chaired by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), will be holding hearings on July 17, 2012, to examine the three proposed constitutional amendments currently introduced in the Senate, which address "Citizens United v. FEC".
Invitations will be issued to the senators who have introduced amendments and to a panel of advocates/experts, who will testify to:
  * The impact of Citizen's United v. FEC
  * The rise of SUPER PACs
  * The impact of unlimited corporate spending on individual candidates
Move To Amend (MTA) has not been invited to participate yet. We have been in touch with Senator Durbin, who has complete discretion over who to invite, and MTA members in the eleven states of the individual committee members have already been in contact with their senators in pursuit of an We are now calling on all of our members to contact Senator Durbin -- please make a quick call tomorrow: (202) 224-2152.

Answer: We don't expect that the Senate will actually pass an amendment any time soon, but it is important that our viewpoint be heard inside the beltway. Our movement is growing, our demands are clear. When and if Congress begins to move, it is imperative they know what the real solution is and that there is a broad movement supporting it.
We must make clear to them that the issue goes beyond Citizens United. The amendment must address corporate personhood and money as speech -- nothing short of that will do.

Reply-To: wl at riseup.net
PRESS RELEASE
State of play of attacks against WikiLeaks to date
Tuesday May 29, 2012 20:30 GMT US GOVERNMENT ATTACK ON WIKILEAKS
* WikiLeaks is under attack. The United States is seeking to charge Julian
Assange - a journalist and publisher - with espionage.
* The US Grand Jury reportedly possesses a sealed indictment, which could be
used to extradite Assange to the United States.
* Secret subpoenas have been served on ISPs and online services for the private
data of WikiLeaks staff and supporters.
* Special task-forces have been setup by various various US intelligence
agencies, including the Pentagon, CIA, FBI, and the US State Department.
* Associates of WikiLeaks have been detained and interrogated at US and UK airports, their equipment confiscated, and attempts have been made to turn them
into informants.
* If the indictment is unsealed upon Assange's extradition to Sweden he faces
further removal from Sweden to the United States.
* Meanwhile, an unprecedented extralegal denial of service by Visa and
Mastercard has cut off funding to WikiLeaks, almost shutting down WikiLeaks'
publishing activity.
THREAT OF EXTRADITION * If the extradition to Sweden is quashed in the outcome of the court
judgement, he faces extradition from the United Kingdom.
* Both Swedish and UK governments have been coordinating with the US, taking
steps to facilitate a US extradition request in either eventuality. Assange
cannot take steps to avoid either risk. For 539 days he has been detained
without charge in the UK under house arrest.
* Under US pressure the Australian government has relaxed its own extradition
law, smoothing any possible extradition from Assange's home country. The
Gillard government has also amended legislation to give Australian intelligence
agencies powers of surveillance over WikiLeaks supporters.
WikiLeaks is under serious threat. The US, UK, Swedish and Australian
governments are engaging in a coordinated effort to extradite its
editor-in-chief Julian Assange to the United States, to face espionage charges
for journalistic activities.
GRAND JURY
For twenty-one months a Grand Jury sitting in the Washington DC area has been
meeting on a monthly basis, seeking to prosecute Julian Assange for espionage.
More] No judge or defense counsel is present at these proceedings. According to the
global intelligence firm Stratfor, a sealed indictment against Assange was
issued 18 months ago, in January 2011. [Read

informants. [Read

AUSTRALIAN COMPLICITY
Australia quietly changed its extradition law three months ago. An amendment
passed in February makes it possible for someone to be extradited for minor
offenses. This amendment weakens the security of all Australians, and
facilitates Assange's extradition from his home country, despite popular
support for him there. There was no media reportage on the passage of this
amendment. [Read
Declassified Australian diplomatic cables reveal that Australian diplomats have
raised no concerns over the possible extradition of Julian Assange to the
United States. The Australian government asks only that it be forewarned, so as
to coordinate a media response.  [Read

The Australian government also passed the 'WikiLeaks Amendment' in July 2011,
broadening the powers of Australia's ASIO intelligence agency to spy on
Australian citizens and anyone associated with WikiLeaks. [Read
At the behest of the US government, Prime Minister Julia Gillard instigated a
federal investigation into whether criminal charges could be brought against
Assange. Before it had been concluded that Assange has broken no laws, Gillard
had already publicly called Assange's actions illegal and stated that his
passport may be cancelled. [Read
More] [Supplementary]
The Australian government has repeatedly delayed, censored and blocked Freedom
of Information (FOI) requests for material that would reveal its internal legal
deliberations over Assange's extradition to the US and has refused to answer
parliamentary questions about the extent of its co-operation. [Read

politicized Swedish extradition request for Julian Assange under the European
Arrest Warrant (EAW) system. [Read More] [Supplementary]

more comprehensive information on Australian complicity.
UK COMPLICITY
Assange has been detained under house arrest without charge for 539 days. If
his May 30 Supreme Court challenge is successful, he is at risk of extradition
to the US under the terms of a one-sided UK/US extradition treaty. [Read More] Long-promised reform of the UK's extradition arrangements continue to be
delayed, and this is despite the findings of two Parliamentary Select
Committees that reform is urgent. [See
The US government is directly involved. A February FOI request revealed the
involvement of Attorney General Eric Holder and other US officials in the Baker
Review on UK extradition reform. The UK government has refused to publish the
evidence on which the Baker Review based its findings. Other FOI requests
specific to Julian Assange have been denied. [Read
US Ambassador Louis Susman confirmed that the US would wait to see how
things work out in the British courts." [Watch] Mr Susman has
been granted extraordinary access to directly address the UK Parliament and its

unnecessary. [Read
SWEDISH COMPLICITY

sources confirming informal talks between Sweden and the US about
extraditing Julian Assange. [Read

WikiLeaks. [Read
Senior Swedish political figures have made false and/or misleading public
statements highly prejudicial to a fair trial for Julian Assange. These include
Minister Reinfeldt, Swedish Foreign
Minister Carl Bildt, Sweden's ">Prosecutor-General
Anders Perklev, investigating prosecutor Marianne Ny
and Justice
Minister Beatrice Ask. Justice Minister Ask visited
US Attorney General Eric Holder in Washington on 27 February 2012 but no
statements outlining what was discussed have been issued.
IRREGULARITIES IN THE SWEDISH CASE
There are numerous concerns regarding the merits and lawfulness of the Swedish
case against Assange, including:
 the two complainants to the case went to the police for advice about HIV
tests. They did not wish to file a complaint. One complainant has stated she
felt railroaded by police. On hearing that police were seeking Julian
Assange for rape, she became upset and did not sign her statement;
 there have been unlawful and prejudicial disclosures to the media by police
and the prosecution regarding the investigation. These have generated over 4
million websearch results linking 'Assange' and 'rape', irreparably harming his
reputation and diminishing public support for WikiLeaks;  after reviewing the police file, Senior Prosecutor Eva Finne found the rape
allegation to be false: I consider there are no grounds for suspecting he
has committed rape;
 there have been breaches of police procedures in the investigation of the
allegations, in particular: complainant witness statements were not recorded
and were later revised;
 the failure to disclose details of the allegations and the evidence in
 the apparent failure of the Prosecutor to consider exculpatory evidence,
and the withholding of exculpatory evidence from the defense and the UK courts;
 the disproportionate behavior of the Prosecutor Marianne Ny in refusing
voluntary offers for co-operation and refusing to make use of the normal
methods of Mutual Legal Assistance for interviewing Assange  insisting
instead on an international warrant which unduly restricts his liberty. The EAW
and a public Interpol Red Notice were issued two days prior to WikiLeaks'
Cablegate publication;
 the pre-trial detention conditions  incommunicado in solitary
confinement  sought by the Prosecutor prior to any decision whether to
prosecute, and their lack of a time limit; and
 the prospect of a secret trial, which is customary under Swedish law.
Please consult SwedenVersusAssange's "Prosecution page for comprehensive
information on the irregularities in the Swedish case. [Click Here]
Under the EAW system UK courts are unable to take any of the above into
account. Julian Assange has not been charged with any crime. The Swedish
extradition is for questioning as part of the preliminary investigation.
Neither the UK Extradition Act 2003 nor the EU Framework Directive intended
EAWs to be used in this manner. Julian Assange's extradition under such
circumstances will set dangerous precedents affecting basic justice across
Europe, whereby extradition is possible from the UK without charge, without
evidence, at the behest of any prosecutor anywhere in Europe and without proper
judicial oversight. FURTHER AGGRESSION AGAINST WIKILEAKS
Other related acts of aggression against WikiLeaks include:
 Leading active US politicians have called for the extrajudicial
assassination of Julian Assange, including by drone strike. US senators have
labelled our editor-in-chief a high-tech terrorist and enemy
combatant engaged in cyber warfare. [Read
 The setting up of a 120-strong US Pentagon team dedicated to taking
action against WikiLeaks ahead of WikiLeaks' release of the Iraq War Logs
and Cablegate. Similar publicly declared FBI, CIA and US State Department Task
Forces are also still in operation. [Read
 Requests from US government figures that American banking corporations
Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Western Union and Bank of America impose an illegal
financial blockade against the organization, blocking the ability of members of
the public to make donations, thereby shutting off 95% of WikiLeaks' funding.
In December 2010 Paypal also froze 60,000 euros of WikiLeaks donations held by
the Wau Holland charitable foundation. Two days later Swiss bank PostFinance
froze Julian Assange's account, containing 31,000 euros, used for WikiLeaks
Staff Defence Funds. The WikiLeaks blockade has been condemned by both the UN
High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Rapporteur for Freedom of Opinion
and Expression. In July 2011 WikiLeaks lodged a complaint about the financial
blockade with the European Commission for infringement of EU Anti-Trust laws.
We are still awaiting an answer, due by August 2012. [Read More]
 The US government has also pressured internet providers to cease services
to WikiLeaks.org. On 1 December 2010 Amazon removed WikiLeaks from their
storage servers, and on 2 December the DNS service pointing to the
Wikileaks.org domain was disrupted. [Read
 WikiLeaks' volunteers and associates have endured constant harassment,
being detained at US border points, having their electronic devices seized and
secret so-called 2703(d) orders issued for their Twitter records. The latter
only came to light when Twitter challenged the injunction against letting
individuals know their records were being turned over to federal authorities.
It is not yet known how many other internet service providers received similar
2703(d) orders relating to WikiLeaks  so far, only Google and ISP Sonic.net
have been confirmed. [Read
