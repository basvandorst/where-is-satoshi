@_subject: Use of PGP as an export? 
I think this has been brought up before, but I could only find one reference
to it in the archives and it wasn't too helpful, so I'll ask again.  If a
university provided a copy of PGP for use on their unix machines and a
non-resident, non-citizen *used* the copy of PGP on the server, but did not
download it onto their own machine, but instead just ran PGP on the server
alone, would it be a violation of the ITAR?  My school is interested in
putting a copy of PGP on the university server and wants to know if they
should somehow restrict access to citizens and legal residents only.  Thanks.

@_subject: Win NT proprietary pw encryption (Was: Re: Windows .PWL cracker...) 
I took a quick look in my NT registry and you can get access to the Account
Manager section of the registry by manually changing the permissions and
giving yourself access.  I didn't have the time to look at all of the
entries in the registry, but there's a lot of stuff there and I wouldn't be
suprised if the encryted passwords were available.  Of course, you have to
be an administrator to change the permissions, but it is possible.

@_subject: NT Password Security Update.  Registry values changed! 
Well, I did some more research into the NT password security issue and I
discovered that I can get access to the Security section of the registry and
there are some VERY interesting values there, stored as raw hex.  I created
a test user and checked the values of these registry keys with two different
passwords and iterestingly enough the data in the keys changed when I
changed the password.  I plan on doing some more work, including changing
the values and seeing if the password change, but I've been somewhat busy
lately.  I've st up a web page at  that has the password I used and the data in the two registry values that
changed when I changed the password.  I invite people to look at it and
speculate what the change means.  Also, I can provide a few more
plaintext/cyphertext pairs if necessary.  The change in the values could be
something like update time, but I don't think that they'd store that as raw
hex, espically hex as long as the stuff I got.  Good luck figuring it out.

@_subject: Repeated Words/characters in Password/Phrase 
Do repeated words in a PGP passphrase make the pass phrase less secure than
a passphrase without any repeated words?  And on the same note, do repeated
letters in a UNIX password make that password easier to break? I can't seem
to find anything in my books on cryptography that mention this.  Thanks.

@_subject: Netscape 3.0 and encryption choices 
In Netscape 3.0, the program allows the user to specify which encryption
standards to allow connections with.  It allows encryption with 128-bit RC4,
128-bit RC2, and 156-bit(I think)3DES.  Of these three, which would be the
most secure method?  It is possible to restrict all secure connects to be of
3DES only for example.  What would be the most secure way to go, DES or RC4?
this is the newly released US-Only downloadable copy of Netscape 3.0

@_subject: Why is cryptoanarchy irreversible? 
That's why we have to develop stealth PGP and good stego so that the
government doesn't even know that you're using the strong crypto that has
been outlawed.  If they can't prove that there's actually a message in the
picture of the catsgills you just downloaded off of
alt.binaries.pictures.nature, you can't get a life sentence in jail.  Ted Cabeen                  cabeen at netcom.com

@_subject: ideal secure personal computer system 
Next time you try booting off of a locked startup disk, try opening the
chooser.  It won't open because to use the chooser requires the startup
disk to be unlocked.  (Last time I checked)
Yeah, but on mac, some basic functions must write to the boot drive.

@_subject: Puzzle Palace 2nd edition? 
I few months ago, around when the second edition of The Codebreakers came out, there was mention of a second edition of the Puzzle Palace.  Was that just a misguided rumor, or is there a second edition in the works?  I was planning on rereading it, but if a second edition is soon coming, I'll wait.
