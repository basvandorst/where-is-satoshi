@_subject: crypto implementation for small footprint devices 
I have been doing some work on this recently, and also have gotten good,
results, specifically, PKCS RSA multi-prime on a Palm is 16.5k
(1024-2 17.63sec, 1024-3 9.6sec, palm IIIx (68xxx 20mhz)), or more
18k on a Psion (ARM7 36mhz, 1024-3 private in 0.18sec and 1024-2 in 0.34sec).
I'm waiting for ARM (or SH3/4 or anything other than 68xxx) to take over
the world.  It make the choice of public key algorithm based on
CPU load less irrelevant when low end devices have this sort of grunt.
I am interested in knowing how small EC can be for both
public/private operations.  Any public information or peoples experiences?
Similar experiences here, we have an ASN.1 encoder/decoder in 8k.
I have not tries the really complex stuff yet,
like SET (and hopefully never will :-).  It is nice to have an ASN.1 encoder
this small but rather obviously it requires a bit of work per
ASN.1 data type.

Well the point here is that the data encryption in GSM is not relevant to
the people running the network.  The authentication is secure,
so there is no fraud, so they still get the money from network
usage.  Privacy was never really there since
the traffic is not encrypted once it hit the base station, so the
relevant government agencies can be kept happy.
The encryption was only relevant to protect the consumers
from each other.
