Yes, and me too.  Someone sent me a package that relied upon reconfiguring Pine using the alternate editor option as a hook and it has never worked well.  This is important.  I am trying to convince my co-workers to start using PGP regularly and an easy interface may not be one of the best arguments to make (for encrypting regularly) but it's one that works on lots of people.

Here's another option.  I just have no idea if it is possible, nor how it
would be implemented!  PGP could allow for an alternate secret key and a
boilerplate document.  This document would be "overlaid" or appended to
the target file at encryption.  When the safety is finally removed from
the gun at your head (sorry for the drama) you hand over your alternate
secret key.  The encrypted file is wiped until it reaches a marker; the
remainder of the file is displayed.  If you are forced to turn over keys
some day (and I think there is at least a reasonable likeihood of that) then They will have a much harder time arguing "But that's not what the file *really* said and, deep inside of me, I know it!".  At that point, with a secure wipe going on while the "decryption" was taking place, you have done the best you could.  I agree- a search warrent gives authorities the right to search your home (or disk)- not a guarantee that they'll find what they're looking for.

Acutally, I have *everything* laying around all over the place but I suppose that's off-topic.
They have to decrypt the file sometime if they want it's "contents".
I use the -w option when encrypting.  After encryption, the "dummy" file
(would be) embedded and the plaintext is wiped.  The only "secret" key is the "fake" key.  The "real" key is under the blender in the kitchen.  (If I get busted and they search under the blender I will write back if I'm in a position to do so.  Not that I have anything to get busted for of course. :)  Don't back up plaintext and what is the problem here?  Where will they get the "real" data from?  What does it matter where the decryption takes place?  And no, I don't have backup tapes laying around; I use a Zip Drive!  :-)

I'll say it again.  :-)
PGP could allow for an alternate secret key and a standard "dummy"
document from somewhere in your path.  A command line option would encrypt
for both keys (as if there were 2 recipients) and append the "dummy"
document to the end of the target file when encrypting. If decrypted with the "alternate" or "fake" secret key, the encrypted file
is wiped until it reaches a marker; the remainder of the file is
displayed.  If you use your "primary" or "real key", the extraneous text
is simply stripped. Alternately, the "dummy" file could overwrite the "real" message n times, to keep the decrypted file size more realistic.
A good point.  A new version of pgp would have to be incompatible with older versions.  That's a Very Big Hassle, I know.  But consider the advantage.  Nobody who has your secure key can prove that it's not the "real" secure key and that the decrypted file is not the real plaintext.  They may "know" it but they can't prove it.  All they can do is force you to hand over *-a-* key that will decrypt the file. Well yes, that is the point I'm trying to address.  The key you finally
give them *is* your secure key.  Just not the key under the blender.  They
will have a hard time arguing "But that's not what the file *really* said
and, deep inside of me, I know it!".  I say again:  All they can do is force you to hand over *-a-* key that will
decrypt the file.  "You cannot force a mind." - J. Galt -

@_subject: Fundamental Netscape hack 
Or- even easier yet- improper httpd installation or users who have not
been properly trained.  NCSA's default configuration file makes document
root a subtree.  One major institution I deal with regularly (and the
administrators should know better) changed the default setting, allowing
users to store html files in their home directory.  And, it seems, the
file permissions were too lax.  If a user had no index.html then I could
just cruise through their home directory, view most files and, in some
(inappropriate) cases, download them.  I told the administrator, and
mailed him a copy of a user's address book (she was a friend and knew what
I was doing before I did it).  The situation has changed and is now more
secure.  But I wonder how many other institutions have an inappropriate DocumentRoot so (I guess) users can have a "single home directory"?
