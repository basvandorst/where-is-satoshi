@_subject: old doc cohen 
dr frederick b. cohen's frequent rants in which he expresses nothing
but contempt for everyone else in the security and crypt business
have to be understood in their context:
what's he selling? who's he trying to sell it to? there are several answers.
all are partly true and taken together explain his posts pretty well.
let's just ignore him. he'll find somewhere else to play (he always does).

@_subject: not a flame please read and think about this 
why is it that half the
people who post here work for the government or big companies that are doing
governments bidding (rand.org (which is part of the the nsa!) att.com (makers of the clipper chip)
mit (which onwns rsa)
netscape etc etc)
what makes me wonder isnt so much that theyre here but that they post socalled
reasonable stuff that supports the  the government line.
like when these people report on
what the nsa guy says at the crypto convention as if were supposed to take it
seriously and these people who say clipper is good enough no back doors.
and then everyone takes this crap seriously.
obviously the government thinks there are some things we shouldnt think
about ourselves. and then someone comes along and says theyve thought about
it already and we should just go mind our own biz. arent we supposed to be
cypherPUNKS? than why do we need these people to think for us?
honest replies only please. i dont mean to flame but this really bothers me. we should maybe think about a closed list.

@_subject: not a flame please read and think about this 
to make my point: why is pat farrel helping the nsa and nist make
better key escrow?
i quote mr farrel:
hey why not just write the escorw code for them!!!???
is mr farrel just being naive or is does he realize who hes working for?
sorry to single him out but this is just an example of what im talking about.
he is not the only example by far.
think people!!!!!

@_subject: net-based key archival 
I just brought these files down + a few others in the same directory that
he didnt tell us about (you can see them with netscape by leaving off the
last part. Check out MKCS.PS and others. They take a while to see because
you need a postscript viewer but if you can read them they are
enlightening abot this guys character. It looks like AT&T is in the
key escrow biz, folks!!! Maybe someone should scan them in and post
them to the list, so we know what the enemy is doing.
The MKCS.PS file is about how to make a code for other people to use so
that you can break. And then they say dont worry the government would never
do this!!! Riiiiggggght.
PS I hope this message goes through, my posting software on connectnet doesn't
work so I'm using penet.
