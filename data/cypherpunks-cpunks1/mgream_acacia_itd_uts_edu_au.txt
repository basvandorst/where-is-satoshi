Have your appropriately trusted person watch the code compiled in
front of him, and take a signature of the completed binary. Although,
this becomes somewhat of a nightmare, as 'Mr Trusted' will need to oversee all 'release' compilations, and spend time beforehand going
over code to verify everything. This signature could be signed by
'Mr Trusted' and included with the distribution, including s/ware
to allow the 'pleb' user ensure they match.

If it's reasonably democratic, sure. But L.D. could simply re-appear as
another entity, which means all new additions to the list would have to
be 'investigated'. I don't like this idea.
The best idea to shut L.D. up is to just ignore him and his rants. Don't
reply to them, and don't talk about him. IMHO witch-hunts are low on the
list of credible actions one can take.
ps: I find the arguments interesting, mostly because a lot is gained by
watching how people (entities ?) argue, techniques used and so on, though
this is hardly within the cypherpunk scope of activity.

In reply to (Pierre Uszynski):
I think this approach is the safest of all mentioned. An earlier poster
commented on the fact that attempting to play 'smart-ass' to your investigators
is only going to result in more problems for you. Its a non-ideal world,
and they definitely have the ability to cause you substantial problems.
Essentially, you need an encryption system that is non-obvious and looks
like totally unrelated data. Of course, it would be pointless to have your
system looking _totally_ clean, because the fact they have seized it
implies they know/suspect something is on there (essentially, the magnitude
of what is on there is what they don't know, and in some cases they are
entirely off track and find nothing).
Encrypting your hard-drive entirely is only going to make them press you
for its key, and become aggrivated at your non co-operation. I am no expert
on investigation techniques, but having been involved in all 3 aspects (
investigator, investigatee and 3rd party viewer), I feel it is essential to
show them everything that they think is there, and convince them (as they
will not be as competent in cryptographic analysis as yourself [at least
you hope]) that there is nothing hidden. This topic has been dealt with before on sci.crypt. An example I can think
of at the moment is something like say you have some software which does
known plaintext attacks using sets of word dictionaries. These word dictionaries could infact be encrypted information using some appropriate
algorithm that maps words from /usr/dict/words into a new sequence. Of
course the only problem with this approach is that your input information
rate div output data rate is going to be quite small.
Something else you can do is use a cipher which takes two input streams
and merges them into the one file, with one key extracting the 'harmless'
information and another extracting the 'harmfull' information. Matthew Gream, M.Gream at uts.edu.au. "... encryption is the ultimate means of

What I said shouldn't have come out that way if you have interpreted
it as such. I don't advocate becoming a subordinate to the wishes of
what the 'authority' wants, and I don't mean for an individual to lay
out everything and anything as a 'narc'.  Co-operation doesn't have
to mean giving your investigators ammunition.
Firstly, methods that destroy your equipment after it has been seized
are most probably illegal (I'm no expert on legal things) and are only
going to cause you trouble. Part of the thread was about this, and I was
disagreeing. Further to this, I was attempting to point out that if you have something
you _don't_ want found, then simply encrypting it leaving it sitting on your system is probably not going to work. You may decide not to answer
any questions about it, you may refuse and so on, but they are going to
want the magic little key and keep pressing (maybe while you are under
oath). To prevent any of this occuring, the best approach (in my mind) is
to encrypt it into a form that will never be suspect as anything more than
harmless, trivial, information.
Say you do have something encrypted, and you are being pressed for its key,
then (as you say), your legal representitive is the ONLY solution you
should take, and you should be as co-operative as you can within the bounds
of your legal rights. The last thing I want to be is an apologist for law enforcement in terms
of the electronic medium. Those who know me would tell you that I am
outspoken about the Australian Federal Police and their activities in
the area of Computer Crime and Investigation.

Yes, that is true, but it still must be a primitive root w.r.t p. Unfortunately I am not well versed enough to explain the mathematical
reasoning behind this, but in the texts I have read, they all stated
this fact.
In an implementation of D-H I did for a project once, I ensured that
these conditions were met. Some probablistic analysis showed that approx
37-38% of numbers < p are primitive roots (done by sampling primes and
testing all n < p to see if n was primitive root), so finding a primitive
root was trivial.

@_subject: more than spread spectrum 
In reply to (Carl Ellison):
Hmm, this is nice timing I guess :-)
Over the last 3-4 weeks I have been mulling over in my head (you know,
that process before you actually start putting down on paper) a design
for a relatively 'simple' learning bridge, using off the shelf support
chips. I'm currently in the middle of an academic semester, and if I
don't happen to work during the coming break (for the non-australians,
our academic year is mar->nov), then this is something I will take up.
The actual design I have in mind has a 839X IEEE802.3 CSMA/CD ethernet
controller on the network side plus an 8088 embedded controller to do
all the work (or, maybe something else, but 8088 assembly is familiar to me and its a real cheap chip). The output stage is a synchronous HDLC varient (SABM mode, cut down for pp operation) running at a select-
able synch rate (anywhere from 19.2k to 10mbps, obviously @ 19.2k you would have problems on a loaded ethernet).
One of the main reasons for starting this is that another colleague of
mine has an interest in constructing the 2mbps microwave (10GHz) project
as seen in your local ARRL handbook. This would tie in nicely, but
further to this, it has the possibility to interface to any communications
medium you desire (as long as it can handle a synch incoming data stream).
It oculd plug into the other side of a spread-spectrum board, it could
be used with an async interface and a pc to tunnel traffic across
another network, and so on.
There is also a possibility to use some of the HDLC initialisation
phases to exchange public keys :-), and to encrypt information frames
(headers == plaintext) on the fly. 'Generic' and 'Modular' is a basic
philosophy of mine. If I do have the time, and complete this project,
then I hope to make it 'available' to the masses (so to speak). I can
envisage that there would be people interested in such a setup.
As an undergrad Computer Systems Engineer student, there are no problems
with access to appropriate design and testing equipment, its just a matter of me getting the time.
Of course, all this is 'in my head' at the moment, so nothing is definite.
Discussion, ideas and pointers are welcome, although the technical side
of things maybe straying from the cypherpunk agenda.

In reply to (Perry E. Metzger):
A company over here in Australia rekeyed the telephone directory offshore
and offered a reverse-directory on our 0055 system (analogous to your
900s), there was considerable uproar over the facility. Firstly the police
and community groups (including privacy groups) were of course angered
at the ability for criminals to reverse lookup targets. The 'teleco' also
made some vague allegations about the legitimacy of rekeying their phone-
books. Anyway, under considerable pressure, reverse directory lookups were removed
for all 'residential' numbers, although the director of the company was
adamant that he was under no legal obligation to do so, but took the action
due to 'public concern'. It should also be noted that from the outset the
company did provide the ability for people to dial up a secondary number
and have their entry removed.
Although, it must be said that CDROM whitepages are available, and i'm ignorant of what limitations have been built into them to stop people (i.e. corporations) turning them into reverse directories.
I thought it was interesting enough when the original poster talked about the TeleMap service, but to now find out that reverse directories are 'common', ho hum.

In reply to (Sandy):
How about this:
Encrypted disk controller that uses 3DES (at a minimum) where the keys
are modified by a low power localised RF transmission. Quite simply one
could use a DDS receiver which looks at any one of X locations for a signal strength above some threshold (ie, say 2^16 frequency slots and
only 3 * 56 of these are transmitting), this provides the XOR for the
DES key. In fact, one could almost patch this into an existing DES
controller given some assumptions about the onboard logic.
Your transmitter should be like somewhere else in your flat, preferably
hidden. Of course, once the feds get your computer and it doesn't work,
they will ask you why, and you need some way here to keep them off.
Actually, another idea, how about if the DES key(s) for your controller
are hardwired onto it, an RF detector monitors a carrier on some specific
frequency, if the carrier is not present at bootup, you could leak a high
voltage into the 'key holder' and blow all the connected links.
Once this is gone, there is no way to get back the data, and the feds
can't force you, because 1) you can show how the key was random in the first place 2) you can show how the device blew it all (and that there was
no return), and your justification can be for 'data security' reasons
(ie, if theives get your system, they couldn't have extracted anything).
They could probably example the chip substrate itself and see what was
blown recently, so this needs work I guess. Another problem is that
the above assumes they don't examine the disk, realise it is encrypted,
realise the controller is custom, and then work back to figure out
what is going on, and then question you before they do anything.
Disclaimer: the above represents unsubstantiated theorising.
ps; when the feds take your computer (at least here in Australia) they
    take lots of nice pictures of it and take all the cables and     stuff. Of course, half of them don't know the fucking difference
    between msdos and unix.

procedures worked, I have absolutely no idea. This was some 2 years ago
now and not only are my recollections vague, but at the time I was a

As for availability of this software, I don't think it was made a public
release (I obtained it from though 'other' channels that I would prefer
not to elaborate on -- and it was lost during 'cleansing'). I suggest getting in contact with Laurie Brown at Melbourne University, I believe thats his current abode. I think I will forward him a note, to satisfy

Here in Australia, we have only two telecos (currently in the midst of a
deregulatory process), one is the prer deregulation entity and as such
owns all the payphones across the country. All payphones can accept cards
similar to what you describe, we call them 'phonecards'. You buy your
topped up card at a newsagent or one of many vendors around the place even
machines on railway platforms. You mention that an 800 number must be called ? Interesting, ours are
totally different in that respect, for all intents and purposes, the card
is nothing more than a cash subsitute, you push it in the phone instead
of coins, and it deducts credit. These cards are throwaway, credit info is
stored magnetically and a holes are punched to give a visual indication
of credit left. An LCD display on the phone shows your credit when you
put the card in. These are true anonymous cash substitutes, of course except that they are not accepted as legal tender. On one occasion, I paid a person this way,
using $30 worth of $10 phonecards, not because of any untraceibility aspects, but because it happened to be convenient tender for me at the time. Also! It is possible to store numbers on them, the intended market being
for parents to give kiddies a card with an autodial number (ie. home)
incase of problems. Kiddie pops in card, it automagically dials home. I
don't have any idea as to whether this number is shown on the LCD when
it is dialed. I suspect it is, otherwise I think you can see situations
like the following:
 A: "If you need to contact me, pop in the card, it'll give me a ring"
 B: "But whats your number ?"
 A: "You don't need to worry about that."

How about something like small random pad, maybe one octet, then a
signature (such as "***Begin ...") with this header information being
encrypted via IDEA CFB. You could also include a more structured header
after this, ie. an ID for the software that created it, so the correct
demodulation technique can be applied, or at least warned about if not

@_author: Matthew Gream 
@_subject: standard for stegonography? 
No. I said that, and I was referring to the case where you have a particular
stegonographic technique such as pixel modulation, it could be an idea to
place an encrypted header using something like IDEA in CFB that not only
encrypts a signature but an identifier so as to know which program actually
did the stego, and hence be able to demodulate with that particular technique. Therefore if you had seperate programs, each could interoperate.
Even though the essense of stego is to not know a message is hidden in a
particular medium, whenever specific software comes out to do certain stego
(jpegs etc), I can see NSA spooks adding it onto their short list of s/ware
to run across any pictures they get. Stego becomes sort of pseudo-Stego and
loses a certain amount of gain it once had (of course, if all you do is
Stego an encrypted file without any structure, it'll be safe).

What do you mean by non-standardised ?
This is limited by the availability of software and the inherent qualities
medium being used to carry the hidden information. In any case, if the
modulation method(s) is/are public, it by itself can't be used to provide any means of security.
As for offset, do you mean that the public-key checksum value determines
how much prepended 'garbage' to skip over before the real stego data becomes available ? This still doesn't work, because it means not only a
lot of wasted bandwidth, but makes it a requirement to have a public-key
in the first place -- any unnecessary tie in. All you want is a quick
means to determine whether data has been modulated into the medium, and if it has by what particular item of software. This needs to be hidden
by some means (eg (cheaply) : s/ware_id + sigma(i=0-n) passwd[i] + csum)
and, as you say, the information itself needs to be unstructured.
Therefore, you can pull pictures off alt.binaries.pictures.contemporary,
run it though something w/ a password "russian_mole" and see whether your
software says "I see this looks like it has a file created by program
 let me extract it".

============================== START ==============================
I did mean the former, yes a standard header, but obviously a user
defined/supplied key -- the system would be worthless otherwise.
No, but in the case of steganography it does make it an impractical
No, I outlined two reasons. Firstly, an offset method such as you mention
wastes a lot of bandwidth. Say you take a conservative 16 bits as offset (which is already too easy to brute force), there you have up to 64kbit of
potentially wasted bandwidth in a transmission medium that needs as much
as it can get. See for example pixel 'stegging', you'd need exceeding large
pictures just to overcome the offset noise let alone modulate data of any
practical length in. The second reason, which yes can be construed as more
a personal dislike, did regard the prerequistite for a PKCS. In retrospect,
I'll retract that.
I agree with the first and foremost as well, steganography is there to
hide data. But by the same token, if the data is hidden, how do you know there is any there ? Isn't the idea that _you_ have a quick means to determine whether something has been hidden there, else it looks like
harmless information ?
With your method, you're leaving it up to whatever particular information
has been stegged in to have some inherent integrity check. Ie. this would
work if you stegged in PGP data or signed data. But what if you stegged
in something else, how do you know it was stegged data ? All I was
proposing was a method of providing a header encrypted so you _know_ that
what follows is stegged information, that was my original intent.
No. You see it works like this. When you go to insert data ('stego it')
into the medium, you prepend some header, but you encrypt the header
under a cipher. This header contains a signature plus other information.
Because it's been encrypted, it looks like junk, it shouldn't be (within
limits of your stego medium) discernable from the original bits that
where there. After that header follows the stegged data.
When someone wants to remove stegged data from the media, they then
pull out a certain number of leading bits using a pre defined steg
method for that media. Those first few bits are decrypted to either
reveal a structured header, in which case you can proceed to remove
the rest of the data, or to reveal junk, in which case there is nothing
there, at least nothing for you.
Yes, that would be a good idea too (excuse the pun .. :-).
I have seen this point, and yes, I guess it is a problem. You would need to at some stage in the past agree on a key to use. How about changing that
from IDEA to RSA then ?
But then why offset in the first place? What is going to be at the offset
that can't be at the front of the file ? If something structured is going
to be at an offset, then it's easily susceptible to being brute force
Okay, how about giving up using some form of offset and just RSA encrypt
a header with the intended recipients key. To check, you'd get your stego
software to pull out the first 2048 bits and decrypt the first X bits
corresponding to whatever your modulus length is with your private key,
if the result is "*STEGO FOLLOWS*+other", then theres a file there, else
you know nothing exists there (at least not for you ..).
However, this is half hearted because after thinking about it, I've come
to the conclusion that it's probably best if all the software does is
push the bits in and leave it up to Stealth-PGP (or other software) to
provide a means of creating the header and the proceeding data in a way
so that no key-ID's or so on exist. Then you could just
"desteg < art | stealth-pgp > out" and watch Stealth-PGP's exit code.
The desteg software shouldn't attempt to put anything in to identify
the presence of stegged data tho.

Engineers at the National Security Agency". It's dated about 1976, and
describes what engineers, physicists, mathematicians and computer
scientists can engage in at NSA. The people in the pictures look like they had been rescued from a 70's
low budget CIA or Police TV flick. As for equipment, there were
pictures of oscilloscopes, `computers' with LEDs and switches on the
front and other stuff as well (and neat labels on the switches too).
Much was given to the potential types of work you can do, and
descriptions of the facilities at Ft. Meade (though, it didn't
explicitly name the place, but named campuses where you can study at
while working at NSA -- the target audience is high school students it
seems), most either in Maryland or Washington DC (if my US geography

security risk in itself, knowing the exact places and courses that NSA
personel are located, almost as bad as our DSD advertising for job

`Cryptography   is  a  very   political  technology'  says  Phil
Zimmermann,  author  of  Pretty Good  Privacy  (PGP), a computer
software  program  to  scramble  and  protect  your  most  vital
electronic  messages.  Complex algorithms such  as those used in
PGP  now give individuals the ability to carry out conversations
locked  away  from  the prying eyes  of  the most determined Law
Enforcement and National Security Agencies.
Fearing  a widespread loss of  effectiveness, these agencies had
their  wishes granted last year  with the US Governments release
of  the electronic `Clipper Chip'.  This insidious device, to be
planted  in  phones and facsimiles,  may scramble voice and data
between  both  ends of a connection,  but contains a backdoor so
these agencies can retain their surveillance edge.
Despite  assurances  by  the Government  and  proponents  of the
scheme  such  as  leading  cryptographer  Dorothy  Denning,  the
reaction  has  been  clearly negative  as  evidenced by echos of
dissent  across cypherspace. These assurances are easily refuted
by  John  Perry Barlow from  the  Electronic Frontier Foundation
(EFF)   and  Dave  Banisar  from   the  now  Electronic  Privacy
Information  Centre  (EPIC)  [*], representing  two  of the most
active groups opposing Clipper.
Viewed   from  the  Australian   perspective,  Jennifer  Seberry
describes  the  Clipper  proposal as  applying  `an atomic bomb,
where a drop of ointment is needed' and Trudi McIntosh describes
a  Government  looking on `with  interest'.  To Roger Clarke, an
Australian  expert  on  privacy  issues  and  new  technologies,
Clipper  seems  unlikely, but he  warns about complacency in his
assessment  of  the  possible  ramifications  for individuals in
electronic  societies  where  systematic  surveillance  and mass
matching could serve as a tool of the totalitarian state.
In  protecting ourselves from an  Orwellian society, the need to
extend  the physical concepts of  anonymity into the information
world  become of increasing importance.  The work of David Chaum
towards  Digital  Cash, and truly  anonymous payment systems can
steer the information superhighways past the military-industrial

@_subject: Cyberspace is by nature crime-free 
I have to disagree with this, especially the title 'is by nature'.
Cyberspace as a communications forum still presents many opportunities
for crime as are present in physical and related communications media.
To rattle a few off the top of my head without thinking to broadly:
 - break and enter --> cracking/hacking (whatever you want to call it)
 - vilification, discrimination
 - sedition
 - inciting violence
 - fraud (as you've mentioned)
 - transfering funds, tax evasion
 - illegal business activity, false advertising
 - contempt of court
 - copyright infringment
Admittedly by the nature of cyberspace, detecting and gaining evidence
for these crimes can be more complicated than in a tangible physical
medium, but none the less these actions are still criminal. In fact, I think it is much better that these activities are possible
in cyberspace, since it's a better representation of the real world.
Crime is pervasive, it is naive to expect that it would fail to follow
people into cyberspace.

as above (re. tax evasion). Does it matter if it's not extradictable ?
what happens if it occurs locally ? not all crimes require
False and misleading advertising is a crime in Australia, and granted
it is a form of fraud.
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Huh, you're asserting that because it is beyond their control, it isn't
a crime ? Whether or not it's beyond control or not does not disguise
the fact that legally it's still a crime, and the entire fact that it
is totally beyond their control is debatable. Whilst at the moment, it
seems that that is the case, who's to say things aren't going to be
instigated a little further down the track ?
That's a fairly sweeping argument that `courts are _coming to accept_
the reality ...', they've had a hard time dealing with cyberspace --
and going to have much harder times, but I don't think they're going to
just forget cyberspace.
Yup, the definition of copyright has problems in cyberspace, that is
true, but that doesn't mean it isn't a crime.
I don't agree with this, all these crimes _could_ be enforced to
certain extents -- and regardless of whether they can or not, they are
still crimes, still defined as crimes, and still exist to be used if
the possibility arises.
If I use a pseudonym to run a mailing list for the purpose of
discussing seditious activities and planning such activities,
regardless of how infeasable it is to associate a real name with the
pseudonym or to enforce the law, the activity is still (legally, in
terms of the laws of this nation) a crime.

There are no restrictions on importing crypto into Australia, there are
some on export (hardware only) due to COCOM. ObBtw, I recently queried our Attorney-General's department on this
topic, along with, inter alia, questions relating to whether Clipper
like systems are of interest to authorities in Australia. The reply,
the AG's Security Division, was that `I understand that encryption is
not an issue' -- but he acknowledged they'd been following the US

There are shit laws in many countries, including Australia, but
unfortunately they are still laws and still crimes, ready to be pulled
out and (unfortunately) used. The point is that whether or not it's a
`dead letter' law (as David McKnight puts it), it still exists and
still can be used and (in the eyes of the law, but not necessary in the
eyes of the majority) still a crime.
There is one that I can remember, documented in David McKnight's recent
book on ASIO and it's operation as a political tool against the left
during the 50s and 60s. A leading CPA figure was successfully
prosecuted in Brisbane for calls to citizens to not assist the country
in the next war (something or other, I don't have the book with me).
This only seems to prove my point that a seemingly useless crime is
still there ready be used as a tool of state suppression.
Not yet.

@_subject: OJ`S CELL PHONE 
I wonder about this.
A friend had a Motorola handset he was using with our (Telecom) AMPS
service. When in stand-by mode, it polls the closest cell to determine
link quality and whether any slots are available for use.
When we were on holiday a few months ago, we stayed in a little seaside
town (ie. a small cell) and I can remember eating and noticing the
phone switch to `no service' for a few minutes, presumably as the cell
was fully loaded. While travelling through a National Park the
following day, in the middle of nowhere effectively, the same thing
happened as we went out of network range for a couple of hours.
The question is whether this polling includes the handset identifying
itself to the cell.

@_subject: Hardware RNG's 
You don't even need to build a serial interface, per se, on the RNG
device. So long as you have output levels consistent with RS-232, you
can push a clock down DSR and the random bits down CTS.  The PC (or any
computer for that fact) has no problem looking at these signals, so
although specific software is required, it doesn't require a special
async device driver.
Just as with a parallel interface, you take the next sample when an
inversion of the clock signal is detected. If the computer in question
is too slow, the only side effect is a loss of bits as clock inversions
as missed. If the computer is too fast, it just hangs around a while.
If the RNG device has a negative rail (>=5v), no extra components are
needed, otherwise you'll need to generate it, something like a Maxim
RS-232 line driver (which only requires +5v/gnd and generates +/-
RS-232 voltages) will do the trick. Certainly cheaper than a UART
(which would require line drivers anyway).
I remember a ham friend of mine telling me of a certain syncronous TNC
that communicates with a PC device driver using CTS/RTS, I thought it
was a cool hack at the time :-).

@_subject: WARNING! 
And if a near polynomial time method is developed for factoring or
breaking RSA (or any other PKCS you care to mention), super large keys
aren't going to matter a hoot.
Anyway, it's a subjective choice if you decide to use super large keys,
I don't think people should be flamed for making that choice. Sure,
point out to them the fact that it doesn't really give any extra
security, but it makes some people _feel_ secure, so let them be. Some
people waste money protecting themselves against things that are
statistically less likely to happen than things they don't protect
themselves against, but it makes them happy.
If people want to choose large key sizes that aren't supported by
software, then they're the ones that suffer the most, by way of
decreased audience. If enough people use super large keys, then maybe
software developers will come around to supporting them -- market
forces and all that.
It's kind of funny to see bickering over bigger keys, I thought
cypherpunks would be happy with people demanding or wanting bigger keys
:-). What's important is that people are deciding not to use smaller
keys and they're realising the need and requirements for strong crypto
through bigger keys.
Big is good, Bigger is good, Smaller is doubleplus ungood :-)

@_subject: Other Spy Agencies 
In Australia, the Defence Signals Directorate (DSD) is on par with the
NSA in terms of responsibilities. The DSD is relatively unknown to most of the population, and indeed their charter was only made public
in 1985 as a result of recommendations in the Hope Royal Commission
on Australia's Security and Intelligence Agencies (the DSD report, along with another, was not published on "security grounds"). It's
rather funny to read advertisements in the Cweath Gazette for DSD
positions with duties involving ".. collection, analysis and reporting
of foreign radar emissions and .." :-). Read Ball/Richardsons "The Ties that Bind" for a DSD history, but this 10-15 year old publication is out of date wrt. recent changes in DSD operation/etc.
Anyway, cutting to the chase. I was having a chat with a local producer
of crypto IDE/SCSI/IEEE802.3 cards just last week at our PC94 show. This
place had tried to get these products approved for use by Government
Departments (the Evaluated Products List) which means the DSD has to actually test and approve the product, but in his words "they wanted the product and a way to crack it in order to evaluate it, we said it couldn't be cracked, and they said 'well we can't evaluate it'". I was going to question him more on this, but I had no time to spare. I'd already waited 15 mins while he babbled with someone with an American accent and when this guy turned around, his nametag said "Department of State" (this was seriously amusing to my friends :-).
Apart from that, they're going to Cebit'94 to market this stuff, so
there seems to be no export problem. Digging a bit deeper, one finds
that their product uses an "ENIGMA varient" for it's security, but
DES (and soon IDEA) PLD tables are available. No prizes to those who
want to guess which they are going to export :-)

@_subject: Dr Dobbs "CD ROM" 
Curiously; thumbing through the last issue of Dr Dobbs (April
94 -- it just made it into the newsagents here), I notice their
CD ROM for sale (well, I've seen it in previous issues, but
just thought about the point I'm going to make now).
Considering that previous issues of Dr Dobbs have contained
cryptographic algorithms (ie. Nov '93 -- scheiner & IDEA), and
this CD ROM makes the code available, then how did they get an
export license -- if indeed they did ?  The order form for the
CD ROM states "add $x.xx if outside US or Canada", so their
market is clearly international.
Does anyone have this CD ROM, is the code in "ready to compile"
form, is it all there ?

@_subject: PGP 2.6 is dangerous in the long term ? 
Personally, I happen to dislike the PGP 2.6 saga; I think it's
effectively turning the wheel back viz. "US only software" as well
as confusing the issue ("oh, which PGP do you have ?"). Some say that it's not a problem in the sense that PGP 2.3a will be
upgraded to "support" PGP 2.6. Even this situation is clearly
undesirable as PGP itself becomes a fragmented product -- esp. as I
think "new users" will opt for PGP 2.6, and others will change too
because of the purported "legitimacy". The result is that PGP 2.6
_will_ become heavily adopted in the US.  This it not the point,
As the RSA patent is expected to expire in the coming years, one would
expect the liberation of PGP, at least in terms of the RSA algorithm
(negating the export control issues). The sinister fact of PGP 2.6, and
other derived RSAREF product is that even as the patent itself expires,
RSADSI still exerts control over PGP by way of RSAREF.
Being Australian, I've not read the RSAREF conditions, but there is at
the point that commercial use will still not be possible (at it would
be under non-RSAREF 2.3a) when the RSA patent expires.
So quite possibly, PGP 2.6 is doing a great deal more longer term
damage to the viablity of PGP than is immediately obvious. Is this a
valid viewpoint ?

@_subject: PGP 2.6 is dangerous in the long term ? 
Not if you're referring to some form of "PGP:ng" or otherwise similar
software that can interrogate and support several possible public key
algorithms. The ASN.1 encoded PKCS packets are deliberately designed
with algorithmic identifiers so that "smart" software can entertain not
just RSA, but say El-Gamal or DSA algorithms -- in fact, anything you
car to devise. The same applies to symmetric encryption and signature
One could piss off RSA entirely and go with DSA, whose only
disadvantage being ciphertext doubling is so trivial it doesn't warrant
a mention.

of interest. This debate goes for about half an hour, it is not
generally just a replay of a report from somewhere else.
