Ned Lud and the boys wished to keep themselves and everyone else poor, smash technology, and stop the world just so they would not have to transform their lives.  Just like the french farmers of today.  Since one must already have transformed one's life to get connected to the nets (at least at this stage of technology) there can't be too many genuine luddites here.  If anyone qualifies as luddites in this contrroversy it is the *government*.  They are trying to slow the pace of technological transformation because it realizes that bureaucratic structures are hopless market competitors and will be destroyed by technological change.
I, for one, am not going to permint the neeo-luddites of the coercive state apparatus to stop change just so they can avoid honest work.

Omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence eh?  We might as well give up and go home. The feds have many powers including the ability to nuke the hell out of everything.  The question becomes how usefull those powers are.  After all, Caeser or Louis XIV could "destroy the city, leave no stone standing upon stone and sow the ground with salt."  The difference today is that the "peasants" of the OECD countries are much more powerful than those of 18th century France.
The Feds can apply point force but they can't apply it everywhere.  They can do some things in international waters, they can kidnap some "drug kingpins"  they can't go after every "criminal" *inside* the US much less overseas.  Their limited current powers will be further limited once secure untraceable communications nets are in place.
More than that, their power and prestige depend on how the people they rule view them.  If we turn aside from them, their power will evaporate overnight.  If the KGB couldn't block liberalization, the Fibbies, the Company, and Ft. Meade won't be able to either.  Don't worry about it.  Social change is underway.  We'll achieve autonomy Just In Time.

T >Tim May
One tends to forget that an ATM card is a bearer instrument.  Ive always thought it ironic that the first manifestation of the Orwellian technology of electronic payments that was supposed to strip us of our liberties was a *bearer* instrument.
There are many circumstances where you might want to have someone other than the account holder use ATM or other Credit or Debit cards.  Spouses, children, and employees might be given the card.  If you want to make cheap instant overseas transfers you might give a trusted person an ATM card.  If you want to make regular anonymous payments to someone you might open an account for that purpose, give them the card, and then just deposit whatever you want to transmit to them.  If you've opened an account in a nome de guerre, it might be convenient not to have your image recorded.  There are many more circumstances.
For me the more significant concern is not getting my picture taken but the possibility that card use might be limited to the account holder only.  I like the bearer instrument aspect of ATMs.  Of course, as long as some banks on the net don't use pictures or other personal measurments as a replacement for pins, one can always use these institutions.

Hal, the point is that the government actions you fear are politically unlikely and would be limited to one nation in any case.  Par example - humorous letter to the editor in today's NYT from someone I'll call "Clueless in New Jersey."  He promotes the idea of a 1% tax on the markets for currencies and derivatives (because they are volitile, unproductive and hurt governments).  Even before the passage of such a tax, the currency traders would have relocated themselves (physically or virtually) to an untaxed location.  They nice thing about the modern communications environment is not strong crypto, steganography, or anonymous networks (though these are fun) it is the ability to randomie your physical location while still living as full and productive life as you used to live when tied down to one spot.  The multiplying power of the new technologies also llows you to "run a Fortune 500 corporation" from your back pocket as informal work groups form and disband as needed.
Crackdowns by a single government will just speed up the process of people becoming Permanent Tourists (PTs).  The control problems experienced by modern States do not grow out strong crypto (which is not yet deployed) but out of the growing relative power of individuals.  Power=Choice=Control.  If we have power (the ability to jet anywhere on earth at the speed of sound for 1 or 3 week's average salary) we can make choices and control ourselves.  If we control ourselves others lose control over us.  The individual's natural organiational superiority over larger entities (my right hand rarely wheels on in to federal court to force me to file an environmental impact statement before defecation) when enhanced by modern technology weakens those less organied institutions.
Remember laws are *not* self-enforcing.  The success of their legal regime depends upon obedience by the populace.  Does anyone out there see obedience and deference *increasing*?  I don't.  If disobedience keeps increasing, at some point the rules will be meaningless.  Duncan Frissell

@_subject: National ID Cards!? 
The "Fear of Foreigners" and the "Health Care Crisis" have come together nicely to make a new (forge-resistant *not* forge-proof) national identity card much more likely.  This will, BTW, be the first major piece of ID introduced since the new individualist movements came into existence from 1960 to the present.  It will be interesting to see what the reaction of those movements will be to this major attack.
I will be posting a lot on this subject over the next few months.  My first thought was to form a non-profit 501c3 corporation to raise funds to pay for the reverse engineering of the beast (if it turns out to be a smart card).  Since its design and algorithims will be a public document that we paid for, and no national security issues are involved, it can arguably be reverse engineered legally.  It could be legally done in other countries in any case. In fact, of course, it will be simple for any individual who cares to to resist the thing.
Some approaches (Health):
1)  "I'm an anarchist and I don't believe in such things.  Send me a 2)  "I'm a foreign tourist.  Send me a bill."
3)  "I'm an illegal alien.  Send me a bill."  -- Not recommended for real illegal aliens.
4)  "Here is my Health Security Smart Card, I puddled it with a welding torch.  You're welcome to have it."
5)  When they send you a bill (above) don't pay it say this:  "You have established that the separation of the provision of medical services and the payment for those services is a moral imperative.  I am taking you at your word by maintaining a *rigid* separation between the provision of services and payment for them."
6) Or: "You have used deadly force to maintain an oligopoly on the provision of medical services through licensing and immigration restrictions.  You have prohibited me from purchasing such services on an open competitive market, therefore, I don't owe you a dime."
Some approaches (employment):
1) Open a contract services firm (temp agency) that places illegal aliens with other companies and acts as a cutout for the enhanced worker's ID 2) Open any kind of a business.  No ID requirements for self employment.
3) Convert your job to a virtual one and move overseas.  61% of US expats don't even file US tax returns though almost all are required to do so.
Much more to come.

Also, not enough work has been done in the area of non-anonymous anonymous accounts.  If an account is in the name of an institution (company, etc) beneficial ownership may be just as difficult to determine as with a genuine anonymous account.  A haven-based cutout which holds accounts in ordinary jurisdictions can do many usefull things.  The proliferation of non-bank banks like money market funds also provide other opportunities.

But it's trivial in the case of supermarket "Price Plus" card programs to use a nome de guerre and a mail drop (which you should be using in any case).  Thus you get the discount and the supermarket gets purchasing info which may or may not match your actual demographics depending on whether or not you lied about those as well as your name on the initial ap.
Secured credit cards allow you similar anonymous use of payment facilities (if obtained in a nome de guerre) without surrendering privacy.  That said, I realize that it is difficult even to convince civilians of the benfits of receiving all their mail via an agent.  They consider it weird.  Perhaps "celebrity stalkers" and the general breakdown in civility will ecourage the use of communications screening devices like mail receiving services, voice mail, and the coming network-based communications servers.
Duncan Frissell
What this metaverse needs is a cheap anonymous communications server for all who want one.

If you are the first to read this post, you may be able to use up to $5 of electronic pseudo-cash.  I wanted to be the first to post some so it was worth $5 to me.
Yesterday I bought a Western Union Phone Card (tm) from my nearest Western Union money transfer agent.  It is good for about 8 minutes of phone calls anywhere in the continental US (fewer minutes of international calls).
To use the "cash:"
Call 1 (800) 374-8686
Wait for the tone
Dial the code 428 22 601
When you get a dial tone, dial the (area code) + phone-number of the number you wish to reach.  The system will tell you how many minutes you have available for the call.
Western Union Phone Cards (tm) are available from any agent in $5, $10, $20, and $50 denominations.  They can be (must be) purchased for cash.  I have no idea whether Western Union saves the ANI info of incoming calls and cross indexes it with the outgoing number and the "account" number.
All that I ask is that the user(s) of this card send me email (anonymously if you like) so I can send back privacy consulting solicitations.

Why oh why do we waste so much time seeking systems that are mathematically unbreakable.  You don't need mathematically unbreakable systems to have a free market on the nets.
It costs a minimum of $50K to start a federal criminal prosecution (that is if the perp is inside the US).  This means that the feds can only afford a few tens of thousands a year.  When you add incarceration costs it quickly becomes very difficult.  This being the case, they are dependent on your obedience for law enforcement success.  Like any predator, the government must gain more energy from the kill than it expends on the hunt.  Otherwise it weakens and dies.  Did you know that fewer than 1000 people are convicted of federal tax evasion every year.
Your obedience is in turn dependent on your view of whether or not obedience is right and on your fear of punishment.  Quite apart from computer networks both the ideology of obedience and the fear of punishment have been declining.  Net society further weakens both of these factors.  The consensual hallucination that is rule by others seems more threadbare every year.  The DDR border guards had the machine guns to fire on the crowds at the Berlin Wall on 10 Nov 1989.  It was not mechanical failure or a magic shield that prevented them from firing.  It was simply because a change had occurred in the minds of the citizenry (and in their own Sure the feds can nuke your house.  Would that gain them anything?  It would cost more than it was worth.  What they can't do is sit down next to every person on earth (or on the nets) and intimidate them.  In the past it didn't matter because almost everyone was a peasant bound to the soil.  As you keep piling technology and market opportunities (choices) on individuals, their power increases.  Governance of others is hard enough when those governed are weak.  It rapidly becomes impossible as they gain strength.  Today and in the future, those who "move like Gods through cyberspace" will be much harder to control particularly since such controls will depend not on guns but on them convincing us that we are not free.

Prove it.  Sans guns there's not much private institutions can do.  That's the problem with letting leftists hang around here.  (Just kidding folks.)  They're not worried about governments with nukes and centuries of a tradition of slaughtering millions of people but they are worried about private entities who've hardly killed anyone.

I can live next to a Chevy dealer for 80 years without him sending armed men next door to my house to get me to buy a car.  Bell Atlantic is a bad thing only because it used to have a government granted local loop monopoly.  Since that monopoly is as dead as a doornail no matter what Bell Atlantic or the government thinks about the matter, BA (and indeed the government itself) are just market actors.  As soon as we (and they) recognize their new status, we'll be better off.

How is it possible to prevent it with or without government action.  Since the information superhighway will be carrying "phone calls" and since there will be absolutely no difference between "phone calls" and everything else on the system, "phone calls" can carry everything.  If we don't like corporate offerings "phone calls" can be used to disseminate whatever we like.  Phone and cable services were limited because they were government monopolies.  The only way to assure that future networks don't suffer from these problems, is to eliminate government regulation/monopoly.
The market smashed IBMs closed platform computer system without government help.  There is no risk that Bell Atlantic could impose a closed network system unless the government helps it.  To the contrary, I doubt if they would be able to do it even *with* government help.
And another thing.  I'm sick and tired of moaning about cost.  Services are virtually free today and prices can go nowhere but down.  There are homeless people on the streets of NY with Internet accounts.  The hardware cost of a computer is essentially zero.  What exactly is the fair market value of a Commodore Vic 20 and a Commodore 300 baud modem.  I know I can get an XT+1200 baud modem + shareware comms program for circa $100 at any computer show in NJ.
Once your local loop monopoly is broken, local phone service will be dirt cheap.  Network Email connections via local BBS are cheap.  AT&T Mail charges a big $3/month for an Email account (with 800 number).  Most network services are reachable via Email gateways.
The real prices of almost all open market goods have fallen dramatically since WWII.  This has particularly been the case in telecoms and electronics.  This decline will continue.  We need market discipline not government discipline to open up network access. --- WinQwk 2.0b

One of the public services that groups like cypherpunks can perform is to give both the rulers and the ruled some advance warning of the transformations that are on the horizon so that both groups can adjust their plans.
Rather than debating whether or not the people owe the government information about themselves, you should argue about whether or not the government has the technological capability to discover information about people.

Today's WSJ reports that VISA USA intends to launch a "prepaid" travel card for use in ATMs and POS terminals.  The card, meant as an electronic travelers check, would be yet another form of cash substitute.
This would, in reality, be a Visa card you could purchase for cash.  Presumably US sales of these cards would be subject to cash transaction reporting rules but not those in other countries.
Interesting scenario.  I buy one of these babies for $100,000 in Switzerland.  I arrange to have it not yet "turned on."  (Many of the new prepaid phone cards must be activated before they can be used.) I enter the US carrying a card worth $0.  I order it activated.  Suddenly I have a $100,000 cash card in the US without having imported $100,000 into the US.
The nice thing about the explosion of payment forms that is going on right now is that the regulators tend to get swamped.  It is hard to regulate things with 10 different payment forms (cash, checks, money orders, travelers checks, credit cards, ATM cards, debit cards, bank wires, consumer electronic money transfers, and bill payment services).  When these new cards hit and all of the new electronic banking payment systems are up and running, the Feds will be hard pressed to even keep up with the bare outline of the payments system much less regulate it closely.

I noted that Novell was supposed, today, to assign its rights to Unix to the X/Open consortium based in London.
You don't suppose that X/Open was founded in London so that future Unix versions could integrate crypto without bothering with US export laws.  Another blow to America's competitiveness.

Stew Leonard (Hero of Capitalism) whose Stew Leonard's Dairy Store in Norwalk, CT has the highest sales per square foot of any retail store in the world (allegedly), was busted not because of a computer enforcement move by the IRS but because he was arrested smuggling cash out of the country.  He was taking 80K to the Bahamas or Caymans or somewhere on his private plane.  The Feds didn't say if they got a tip or if it was a spot check based on a flight plan.
That was a couple of years ago.  Finally, they raided his store and home and found the Equity software.  The programmer should market the code.  It would (probably) be legal to do so.
Just goes to show that you computer criminals out there can't neglect your physical privacy arrangements.  I could have taught Stew any one of a dozen ways to expatriate funds without risk of arrest.  Many of them would not even have involved a violation of the laws governing the international transfer of monetary instruments.

I realize that Blacknet debate was eons ago in net time (100 to 1 compression net time vs real time?) but I failed to stick my oar in because I was trying to cope with the 500 messages accumulated while I took an innocent weekend off.  (Note to Perry -- Not *everyone* has a Sparc station at home and at work -- some of us can be swamped).
Aside from contract murder, which shouldn't be much more of a problem than it is now because most people still won't be worth the powder it takes to blow them up, I don't expect blackmail and dossier abuse to be more of a problem on Blacknet than it was, say, in 1925.
Why?  Because there may be fewer grounds for blackmail and the damage possible to a person's reputation will be greatly reduced because (to Moderns) reputations are much less important.
If you compare what a blackmailer might have threatened to reveal about a person in 1925 with what Madonna get's paid millions to do live on stage before thousands of people, you can see the problem.
After all, it doesn't make much sense for a blackmailer to say to you, "I'm going to tell everyone that you are the practitioner of an alternative life style that they are teaching in the schools these days."
Reputation was significant in the past because people were stuck in one small community for their whole lives and they, their children, and grandchildren would have to be living with their neighbors for the next hundred years.  This sort of intimacy with "strangers" ended with the advance of technology, markets, and mass migration.
The nets can only make this worse as even the strangest individuals can find a home with their fellow "deviates" somewhere in cyberspace.
With the President a philandering, dope smoking, draft dodger; at least two cabinet jobs held by homosexuals, the mayor of New York an admitted tax evader; and the rather straight organiation I contract for giving baby showers for the single mothers as they go off to reproduce; it is hard to see many grounds for blackmail.

Dope dealers don't much care if they are reported to the authorities.  That is just another risk of doing business and they don't respect the authorities enough even to fear them.  The authorities are so swamped in any case that they find it hard to grab too many people.  Child molesters remain unpopular (unless they work for the local schools) but they seem almost alone in their openness to blackmail.
Bankrupts, drunks, drug addicts, homosexuals, single mothers, tax evaders, the politically incorrect, anarchists, people who run red lights, are all accepted as part of the glorious mosaic of American society.  Even if they are occassionally fired, the booming market for contingent employment means that they won't suffer much loss of income.  Seems like Blacknet blackmailers are going to have slim pickins.

Since the Internet is an international entity, it is probably not subject to FCC regulation.  Even if domestic accounts are somehow regulated, it is no problem to telenet from my regulated account, (or make a long distance phone call) to Demon Internet Services in London and access my account there automatically downloading encrypted mail and news files.  As most of the comments on the Bell Atlantic/TCI merger suggest, there is little appetite even in the Clinton Administration for telecommunications reregulation.  Such a move would seem to run counter to the domestic and international trends in telecoms policy.  If the Bundesposte has had to surrender *its* monopoly, I doubt if mere US regulatory authorities can prevail in the winds that are blowing now.  Further, such rules do not now govern private networks and setting up a secure, encrypted "enterprise network" is simple and cheap these days.
The regulators will have enough on their plate trying to chase down all those people downloading porno from Zimbabwae and setting up their very own private "virtual" phone companies to compete with the licensed monopolies.

The Feds can't even keep *me* off the nets (without arresting me), how can they keep a whole country off the nets.  Shutting off the nets would be the equivalent of shutting down the phone system (since those will both soon be the same thing).  You couldn't do that to one of the OECD countries at this point.  It would be an Act of War.  It would also cause a total financial panic since everyone would worry about other shutoffs and investors involved in the shutoff country would engage in a run to cash.  Global liquidity depends on a microsecond by microsecond flow of data.  This flow is bound to increase as time goes on.  There is not

That was then.  This is now.  There is a guy in Havana right now selling satellite dishes.  Thousands of Russian computers a month are joining Internet since the links were opened up a few months ago.  With all of the dark fiber now going into the ground/ocean and data compression and multiplexing continuing to improve, I doubt that the regulators will have much effect on bandwidth allocation which is a child of scarcity.  When lines are expensive, you can support expensive central switching and large monopolies.  When virtual "lines" are nearly free, even force majure can't cope with 5 billion people shopping 'till they drop for cheap telecoms.

You also can't disount the physical realities confronting the state.  It is enormously difficult to control workers who can live anywhere on earth and work anywhere else.  The US government may think that it can control Americans but it can't control the rest of the world's population most of whom live in countries that don't even claim to try and tax income earned by their expats.  Everyone on the nets is an expat.
I believe that the percentage of GWP controlled by the world's states peaked at some point since WWII and has started a decline.  With the growth of informal markets, tax evasion, non-national economic activity (offshore), and the privitization of the economies of the SU and China.  If this trend continues, the relative power of states will decline as their control of economic activity declines. B >"No matter how subtle the wizard, a knife in the back will always

Permanent Tourists are outside US jurisdiction.  You could grab a very few but only a few.  You couldn't affect the non-US persons earning their dough on the nets at all.  That's the point of the nets that "foreigners" can be Americans and Americans can be "foreigners" without any loss of income.  Once developed, the ability to work from anywhere to anywhere is powerful.  It makes one much harder to control.  Consider, small cash-intensive businesses located *in* the US report less than half of their income to the government (according to IRS studies).  That is among people completely subject to US jurisdiction.  B >Yes, that could be prevented, but it won't be prevented by what

Actually, such problems are rare in the OECD countries.  Most enforcement here is indirect.  People obey because of fear not direct application of force.  Reduce the fear and you reduce the obedience.  The threat we represent is a bit to abstract to sell the government on an all-out campaign against us that would be difficult and expensive.

The rest of the world has as wide (or wider) a range of climates as the US.  The people you will be interacting with are the same people as you do now on the nets.  I know some people have problems with expatting (to
coining a term) themselves because of homesickness.  Harry Browne couldn't
adjust to Switzerland and so moved to Walnut Creek, CA.  Not everyone is
like that though.  And the nets means that you can take your surroundings with you.  Particularly once we get a VR interface.  Besides, the nets mean that you will be able to *virtually* expat yourself and remain
physically in the US if you like while working "overseas."

Few governments tax the overseas earnings of their own expats.  Any Brit who expats himself physically and works via the nets would have *no* UK tax liability to be busted for.  If this Brit was physically remaining temporarily in different countries as a Permanent Tourist (even the US) and working on the nets, he would have *no* income tax liability.  Just as if I spend 6 months in France "on vacation" while I write my latest novel and negotiate the screen rights to my previous novels over the phone, I may have "earned" $2 million in France but would have *no* French tax liability as well as no right to work in France.  That sort of activity is not considered "work in France."  The nets mean that more and more people (musicians, surgeons, lawyers etc.) will be able to work as writers have always done -- from anywhere, to anywhere.  No tax consequences.

Governments are more likely to (as indeed they have already done) offer PTs special treatment to encourage them to hang their hat for a temporary basis.  This is sort of a reverse auction in which governments offer lower and lower taxes to snag the PTs who can go anywhere.  For example, you can't legally have a secret securities account or buy treasury bonds anonymously in the US but foreigners can.  A bank can acquire and hold T-Bonds for anonymous foreigners as long as it swears they are not Americans.  The Feds did this because they *need* anonymous foreign buyers for their debt instruments.  Why don't the Feds nuke any banks that try this.  They have the bomb after all?  Why, instead, do they explicitly allow this loophole by regulation?  They need the money.
B >Sooner or later, of course, this won't matter but, as I've said,
B >at least for the short term, it _does_.
There are already hundreds of thousands of American PTs living overseas.  That was done under *old* technology.  61% of expat Americans don't file federal income tax forms even though they are required to do so whether or not they fall under the $70K exemption for overseas earned income.

I try and pay attention.  I just think that some over-romanticize the state by investing it with magic powers that it doesn't have.  Depending on your exact place of residence, you are more likely to be mugged by private parties than by the state.  The technology doesn't strengthen the state, it weakens it.

With no place to apply the force.  A "target lean" environment not because there are so few targets but because they are mixed in with so much other activity.

Aside from other states, its only opponents were poorly organized peasants or townies "bound to the soil."  States no longer control communications or transportation and their opposition is rich and mobile.  Their hierarchical organization is expensive, slow, and has few returns to scale in an era where I can pick up the phone and rent a 747 within an hour.  It can't cope with very nimble markets that will continue to accumulate a higher and higher proportion of the world's wealth.

Sprint cut a deal with Hallmark whereby you will be able to buy $6 greeting cards with a 10 minute Sprint phone card inside so your recipient can call you back.  This makes the calls 60 cents/minute which is the going rate for domestic LD calls on these cards.

Being 'judgement proof' means that even if a civil judgement is obtained against you, it cannot be satisfied.  It means that you have no attachable property.  The property can be in the name of another person or entity or in another jurisdiction.  It is a very relaxing feeling.
In the mid '80s for example when Roy Cohn (of the Army-McCarthy Hearings) was dying of AIDS, he had outstanding judgments of almost $1.5 million against him from the IRS and private parties.  Meanwhile, he lived in a brownstone on the upper east side of Manhattan, used a house in the Hamptons, and regularly flew Concorde to Europe.  The judgements were never executed against him, however because he had no money.  He was judgment proof.  The houses and other perks were supplied to him by the law firm of which he was an obviously valuble employee.
Judgement proofing yourself is a powerfull concept.

AP 09/21 0844  Encryption Software
Copyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A federal grand jury is investigating exports of a controversial computer program in a case that could affect how software is distributed worldwide.
   U.S. Customs officials asked for an investigation into ViaCrypt of Phoenix and Austin Code Works of Austin, Texas, and the companies' plans for foreign distribution of software, including PGP, a program that turns data into an indecipherable code using encryption technology.
   William Keane, an assistant U.S. attorney, confirmed that an investigation is continuing, but declined to comment on the case.
   The PGP program has been distributed worldwide over computer networks by some computer enthusiasts who oppose the U.S. government's trade regulations on encryption.
   The National Security Agency, which monitors international communications, has supported strict encryption technology export regulations, arguing that it would be difficult to keep tabs on hostile governments and foreign terrorists.
   But opponents say the restrictions hurt sales and violate the First
Amendment that protects the right to publish information about encryption.
   "I wrote PGP to make democracy healthier. I didn't do it to make money," said Philip Zimmermann, a computer consultant who developed PGP.
   "We believe everything we are doing is above board and well within the law," said ViaCrypt president Leonard Mikus. He said the company had no intentions of violating export regulations.
WP (Washington Post) 09/18  Encryption Program Stirs Security Debate
By John Mintz and John Schwartz
Washington Post Staff Writers
    Computer industry officials and civil-liberties activists are launching new attacks on the Clinton administration's plan to make the so-called clipper computer chip the national standard for encrypting, or scrambling, data and voice communications.
    Under the clipper plan announced this year by the Clinton White House,
police agencies that receive court authorization for a wiretap to intercept encrypted communications would then need the technological cooperation of two independent "escrow" agents to crack the code.
    Earlier this week administration officials told congressional staff members that the two escrow agents will be officials of two government agencies: the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and a non-law enforcement section of the Treasury Department that has not been selected.
    Yesterday industry and civil-liberties groups criticized that selection because they said NIST and Treasury are not independent, but arms of the same federal government that could some day be called upon to listen in on their communications.
    Douglas Miller, government affairs representative of the Software
Publishers Association, made up of U.S. software firms, said his group has
"grave doubts" that foreign corporations will encrypt their communications with the clipper chip because "the U.S. government holds the key."
    A main reason the administration is promoting clipper is that the U.S.
National Security Agency, the super-secret code-breaking agency, wants to
discourage use of highly capable, non-clipper encryption programs that are
becoming increasingly popular but  that  the NSA can't pierce.
    Industry officials for years have regarded NIST as a stalking horse for the NSA.
    Jerry Berman, director of the Washington office of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which promotes public-interest causes in technology-policy areas, said NIST is "so close to the NSA that it can't give the public comfort that this is a true escrow system."
    John Podesta, assistant to the president and a key White House staff member on this issue, said such objections are "a phony issue."
    "We clearly are looking for procedures and escrow agents that would
maintain privacy and confidentiality and security of the keys," Podesta said.  "Cryptography lends itself to a certain degree of paranoia."
    Kate Martin, director of the Center for National Security Studies of the American Civil Liberties Union, mocked use of the term "escrow" in this case. An escrow agent is someone who is independent of two parties potentially in conflict, like a settlement attorney at a real estate closing, she said.
    "As long as the escrow agents are government agencies, it's misleading to call them that," she said. "The government doesn't have a fiduciary obligation to the people whose (communications) keys it holds," but only to the government.
    "The whole idea continues to be structurally flawed," said Bruce Heiman, attorney for the Business Software Alliance, a group of top U.S. software firms, such as Microsoft, Novell, Lotus and Apple. Companies and individuals who transmit secure information "will have serious doubts about the integrity of the system."
    Since the government currently prevents the export of many powerful
U.S.-made encryption techniques, the administration's attempts to promote its clipper chip "will discourage use of encryption, period, or hand over the market for encryption to foreigners."
    When one listens to an encrypted conversation, it sounds like a crackle or buzz.
    Under the plan, every law-enforcement agency will have a special personal computer or "black box" to descramble that crackle, but the device will work only when they have been given a special key from the escrow agents.
    When police get a judge's permission to intercept an encrypted conversation or stream of computerized data, they would use the box to determine the special encryption identifier or label assigned to that particular encryption device.
    A detective would notify NIST and Treasury that he or she has permission to listen in on the party. NIST and Treasury would have a list of the secret encryption key numbers - extremely long lists of 0s and 1s - for every encryption device sold in the  United States.  NIST and Treasury would find the appropriate one on the list, and then they would send the needed key number to the police over telephone lines. The police would then insert that decoder number into the black box to tap the phone line in question.
    The ACLU's Martin said the government, given lists of secret encryption numbers, "has an enormously greater ability to eavesdrop than it's ever had." Government officials deny that.

A response to my .sig forwarded to the list because this is a "hot" issue with cypherpunk implications.  My improved HSA93 .sig:
"The $1,000,000,000,000 a year Health Security Act of 1993 -- the most expensive government program in the history of mankind."
The response:
W >1 Trillion 1993-dollars is about 300 billion 1980-dollars - how much
W >was the government spending then?
I don't think prices have increased by more than 300% since 1980.  General price inflation during most of the 80s was in the 4% or lower range per year. During the '80s, the Fed and State governments spent about 40% of the US health care dollars.  Total 1992 spending public & private was circa $850 billion.  Which would make government spending about $350 billion which I think it was. By January 1, 1997 when HSA93 is due to take full effect, health spending including inflation and the $70-$100 Billion in extra annual spending Slick Willie has plotted will push annual health spending up to circa $1,000,000,000,000.00 per annum.
Granted, my .sig is marketing puffery.  Note it does *not* say that the government will spend $1x10^12, but since the *program* is designed to encompass the whole health "system" it is correct to characterize the cost (to someone) of the program as $1x10^12 per year.  They want the credit, they deserve the blame.   W >World War II was much more expensive - maybe fewer direct dollars

W >cost. (Don't know what it is, but it's likely to be much larger than
W >the $1T/year times the 2-3 more years before Clinton gets thrown out on

WWII was over in 5 years.  HSA93 (like a baseball game) *could* go on forever.  Also, we don't know how many people have died because of medical regulation (though, of course, medical regulation is larger in scope even than HSA93).  Could be more than WWII.
I don't expect the system to last that long, however.

Watch.  We already know how to set up an "enterprise" network that excludes anyone the operators wish to exclude.  We also know how to encrypt the traffic such that only authorized persons can read it.  We also know how to do traffic mixes that make tracing difficult or impossible.  And, finally, we know how to do this offshore, or in other countries, or using split processes running on different (or virtual networked) machines in many different locations at the same time.  These virtual processes can shift around the physical world on a random basis.
Rather difficult to regulate particularly since loads of people will be able to make their money while living anywhere on earth.  In any (changing) jurisdiction.
T >and I really don't see what private financing has to do with it
It does provide a little more flexibility plus lower costs and better service.  This would speed up the networking process.  But you're right, we can use the National Information Infrastructure for our own purposes if we like.

Nothing can change the fact that technology can be adopted, once created, by people all across the world and then rapidly adapted in new and different ways by people who have a little different take on the way that technology works...
...I tell you my fellow Americans, that if we learn anything from the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the fall of the governments of Eastern Europe, even a totally controlled society cannot resist the winds of change that economics, and technology, and information flow have imposed on this world of ours.  That is not an option.  Our only realistic option is to embrace these changes...

Peering into its crystal ball in 1958, the Harvard Business
Review said that computers would revolutionise American business.
By the end of the 1980s they would ensure that American business
would be concentrated as never before. The economy would be
dominated by a few giant firms. Within each firm important
decisions would be made by a handful of executives with access to
the firm's single, big computer.

more and more of those employees have a computer on their desk."

Time for one of my screeds on why it doesn't matter.
"Jim" our tame FBI agent at CFP '94 said that the FBI did 500 wiretaps (that they'll admit to) and one datatap in 1993.  He said that they can only find someone willing to do about one datatap a year because it takes an incredible amount of time to go through the logs and there's rarely anything interesting.
(Pause while hundreds scream that they will be able to deploy fabulous AI programs to scan everything and arrest everyone and convict everyone and throw everyone in jail.>
1)  They don't have the fabulous AI programs yet.
2)  AI programs can't bust anyone until Robocop arrives on the scene and Robocop can't (easily) bust people outside of the jurisdiction.
3)  If you run AI software against something as complex as human society, you get loads of hits.  So you tighten your parameters until you only get the number of hits that you can handle.
4)  The feds can only investigate, bust, convict and imprison a comparatively few people a year.  (The US couldn't even pull off a decent version of The Holocoust these days.  It would cost too much.  WACO was 80 some odd dead and it must have cost the feds $millions.)
5)  AI programs *can* be used to "punish" people by withdrawing government "benefits" automatically from miscreants.

PERSONAL FINANCE - Seeking the Card That Would Create A Cashless
World. The Washington Post, April 03, 1994, FINAL Edition
By: Albert B. Crenshaw, Washington Post Staff Writer
Section: FINANCIAL, p. h01
Story Type: News National
Line Count: 105    Word Count: 1164
Now that credit cards are in the hands of virtually every living,
breathing adult  in  the  country-not to mention a lot of children
and the occasional family  pet-and  now  that  almost  as  many people  have  ATM cards, card companies are wondering where future
growth will come from. At *Visa* International, the answer is: Replace cash with plastic.
   Last month,  the  giant  association  of  card issuers announced
it had formed a coalition of banking and technology companies to
develop technical standards  for  a  product it dubbed the
"Electronic Purse," a plastic card meant to replace coins and bills
in small transactions.    A second  coalition of manufacturers and suppliers will seek to
develop low-cost equipment for use with the card.
   The concept  is  much  like a Metro Farecard. Consumers would
prepay-or electronically  "load"-the  card  with  a small sum,
typically $40 or less, according  to  *Visa*  officials,  and carry  it  with  them to use in pay telephones,  highway  toll booths,  vending  machines,  parking meters and thousands of other
small-ticket transactions.    Unlike a Farecard, though, the card would be reusable. It would
contain a  memory  chip that could exchange information with bank
ATM terminals for "loading"  and  with  terminals  at  vending machines and other places for payments.  *Visa*  envisions  it both  as  a  stand-alone product and as a feature that could be
incorporated into credit or ATM cards.    "There are  a  number  of benefits to different players" in the
market, said Albert Coscia of *Visa*.
   In theory, machines that would take the "electronic purse" would
be used with  small-change  kinds of devices, such as phones and
parking meters, so for consumers, it would eliminate the problem of
having the right change.    In addition,  depending  on what consumers want and what the
technology can accomplish, the cards might have other features,
such as the ability to remember  specific  transactions  so  that a  consumer could keep track of exactly  what  he  or  she  spent the money on and where. Budget-conscious individuals  or  business
travelers doing their expense accounts might find that very
appealing.    For vendors, the card would cut the need for sorting and
counting coins and  carting  them  to  the  bank.  The day's
transactions would be totaled instantly.  Also,  vendors  would be  less  likely to lose sales because a potential customer didn't
have change.    Since transactions  would  be  electronic,  it  would  be tougher for employees or others to dip their hands into the till.
   But while  the  idea  certainly has appeal, it is far from
certain that *Visa*  and  its  allies  can make it fly. People have
been talking about a cashless  society  for  years,  but  the number of cash and check payments continue to dwarf those made on
plastic.    Robert B.  McKinley  of  Ram  Research  Corp., a Frederick
research and publishing  company  that tracks the credit card
market, noted that putting in all the terminals and other equipment
"has a horrendous price to it." In addition,  he  said,  "smart cards," those with chips in them, have in the past proved expensive
to make and easy to break.    Also, a  smart card that replaced all your credit and debit
cards as well as  checks and cash would become "a gateway to your
entire financial being, and  without some kind of safeguards," loss
or theft of the card could be a disaster, he said.
   Putting in  safeguards  such  as a personal identification number
(PIN) would  make  the  card cumbersome to use for small
transactions and require more elaborate equipment at the point of
sale.    The card "certainly (could be) a personal financial management
tool" and might  evolve  into a global payment system-*Visa*'s
goal-but it has a long way to go, McKinley said. "It's all pretty
much concept stuff right now."    *Visa* concedes  that  there  are major technical and market
hurdles to overcome.  Coscia  said  the  company  expects that the
concept will spread faster in other countries where
telecommunications and on-line systems-that allow instant credit
checks and debit transfers-are less developed and less established.
   Where such  systems  are  not as advanced, off-line systems such
as the Electronic  Purse  are  more  appealing because they offer
the merchant the assurance of payment without external
verification.    Cards  containing  microchips  cost anywhere from $3 to $8,
depending on the sophistication of the electronics, but *Visa*
officials said they think that with the volumes they envision, the
cost would drop to around $1.
   Coscia also  said  that  pilot  programs  in  Europe  indicate
that the physical  durability  of the cards is improving. "Dropping
it won't wipe it out," he said.
   He indicated  that  some  of  the  apparent conflicts might be
resolved through  technology;  perhaps  it  could require a PIN for
credit and debit transactions  but  not  for those that tap the
prepaid funds carried in the card. As chips become more and more
sophisticated, more alternatives become possible, he said.
   Coscia said  *Visa*  doesn't  expect  the Electronic Purse to
come into widespread  use  for  years.  The  purpose  of  the alliance is to develop standards  that  would  ensure  that cards
and terminals could talk to each other no matter who makes them or
country they are in.    "We want to eliminate the possibility that someone gets too far
down the road"  with  a  system  that  is  incompatible  with
others, as happened in videocassette recorders with the VHS and
Beta formats, he said.
   He said the consortium hopes to have its first pilot application
of its new standards operating by the end of next year.
   Besides *Visa*, the  consortium  includes  two  large  U.S.
banking companies-NationsBank  Corp., based in Charlotte, N.C., and
Wachovia Corp., based in Winston-Salem, N.C.-as well as Electronic
Payment Services Inc. of Wilmington,  Del.  The  non-U.S. members are
Banksys of Brussels; Financial Information  Systems  Center  of
Taipei,  Taiwan;  Groupement  des  Cartes Bancaires  of  Paris;
Sociedad  Espanola  de Medios de Pago of Madrid; and Sociedade
Interbancaria de Servicos of Lisbon.    The consortium will accept other members in the future, *Visa*
said.    Both  critics and proponents of the Electronic Purse point to
the debit card  as  instructive.  The  technology  to use debit
cards at the point of sale-that  is,  to  transfer  payment  from the  customer's  bank  to  the merchant's  bank  right  on  the
spot-was around for years before they came into  widespread  use,
such as at many grocery stores. It was the growth of one  form  of
debit card-the ATM card-that finally pushed them into general use.
   Proponents look  at  that  history and say it is only a matter
of time, while  critics argue that unless some particular use comes
along to give it a shove it may never go anywhere.
   Ultimately, *Visa* hopes to become a true international payments
system.  Consumers  could use its cards for credit or debit
transactions or in place of  cash  and  get  a  single  statement with all the currency conversions already done.
   "If you look at payment alternatives, with a credit card you pay
later, with  a  debit  card  you pay now, and with a prepaid card
you pay before," Coscia said.

MacNeil-Lehrer - Clipper Segment - Thurs 07APR94
OPEN SESAME
Next tonight, law enforcement vs privacy on the information A tiny piece of silicon, the clipper chip, has raised questions
about how to balance individual privacy rights with the needs of law enforcement agencies in the computer age.  Time Magazine technology editor, Philip Elmer-Dewitt, reports.
Today's high tech information highway has a major drawback.  For some people it's not private enough.  Many of the routine transactions conducted by computer and over phone lines leave a trail of digital fingerprints, messages recording the time and
date and nature of the transaction.  These are stored on computer
disks and can be easily traced.  Some consumers simply need absolute security, the assurance that confidential phone calls, faxes, or financial transactions cannot be intercepted.
[Two AT&T employees using an AT&T Secure Phone]
[Woman] "Good morning, AT&T."
[Man] "Good morning, Miss Bishop, this is Mr. McGovern."
"To keep transactions private, computer experts advise people to talk in code, as these representatives from AT&T demonstrate."
[Man] "I'd like to go secure, if we could, please.  I'll come to you."
"They're scrambling their telephone call, just like spies do."
[LCD screen on man's set displays, 'secure dE05']
[Man] "Would you please give me the first two numbers, and I will give you the second two."
[Woman] "OK, the first two numbers are 'dE'."
[Man] "Fine, we're secure now.  And now I'd like to discuss some
company information with you."
[Nerd at keyboard, clicking check box labeled 'DES Encrypt' on screen labeled 'DSS Options Menu']:
"OK.  I can choose this option to do both signature and "Cryptography is the science of making and breaking codes, of turning plain text into coded text, or cipher.
"OK.  This is our old 1040 form."
"Like taking this 1040 tax form and changing it into unreadable
"This is your actual encrypted text of the 1040 form."
[Ciphertext scrolls up screen.]
Marc Rotenberg [of CPSR] 'Computer Privacy Advocate':
"Cryptography is the way you make communication networks secure.
It's the way you protect privacy.  It's the way you make it possible for banks to send financial information, for businesses
to send trade secrets, for individuals to send personal records, medical records, financial data.  All of this happens because cryptography is the basic technology of privacy."
"All modern encryption systems are variations on the secret codes
school children use to jumble words.  The simplest kind of code
is a straight forward letter for letter substitution, for example
where A stands for D, B stands for E, C stands for F, and so forth down the alphabet."  [WFW screen showing the simple ROT3
substitution cipher mentioned.]
"These simple codes have evolved into mathematical formulas of such extraordinary complexity that they're virtually unbreakable.
[Scene of a hand pushing a card into a Datakey reader.]  In the
past few years, a new generation of very powerful encryption
tools have entered the marketplace.  They are easy to use and easy to get by just about anybody.  And they are a matter of concern to law enforcement and national security experts who rely on information gathered from wire taps to do their jobs.  [Scene of technician wiring a phone board.]  Geoffrey Greiveldinger is Special Counsel for the Justice Department."
"There has become available, and there has certainly become available in larger numbers and greater variety, very effective, very user friendly, very high voice quality encryption.  And suddenly the prospect of encryption being used regularly in the private sector is one that law enforcement recognizes that it's going to have to grapple with.  That really is what brought us up short."
"Lynn McNulty is with the National Institute of Standards and "Encryption is a double-edged sword.  It can be used to protect
law abiding citizens and it can also be used to shield criminal activities and also activities that can affect the security of this country."
[Aerial shot of Ft. Meade on a workday --- acres and acres of employees' cars.]
"Secret codes and national security are the bailiwick of the NSA,
the top secret branch of government that sucks up international
communications traffic like a giant vacuum cleaner in the sky,
using the most powerful decryption technology available to tease
out its secrets."  [Shots of NSA sign and main building [Interior shot of NSA museum, with Enigma Machine and Cray in background.]  "Cryptographers used to use mechanical devices like
this World War II era Enigma Machine, to make and break secret codes.  Now they use supercomputers, like this Cray XMP.  A cipher from one of these [Enigma] machines could be broken in a matter of minutes.  Supercomputers can design secret codes so complex that it would take another supercomputer centuries to crack it.  And that's a problem for the National Security Agency
which gathers foreign intelligence for the US and runs this cryptologic museum in Ft. Meade, Maryland.  The NSA has never met
a secret code it couldn't crack.  And it wants to keep it that [Hand holding Clipper Chip.]  "So the NSA developed a new code
called 'Skipjack' and put it in this silicon chip, smaller than
a fingernail.  This is the Clipper Chip, the focus of a fierce technological policy debate among privacy advocates, law enforcement, and the business community.  The Clipper Chip [graphic of chip labeled 'MYK78A'] combines a powerful encryption
scheme with a back door [skeleton keyhole appears on Clipper graphic], a master key that unlocks the code [Yale key slides into skeleton keyhole] and lets authorized law enforcement agents
intercept --- and understand --- coded messages.  The NSA wants
the National Institute of Standards & Technology and all other government agencies to use Clipper, and only Clipper, when they want to be sure that their phone calls, faxes, and electronic mail can't be intercepted.  To encourage its use in business,
the US guarantees that the Clipper code is uncrackable and that
the master keys that can unlock it are safely stored away.  In a
plan devised by the NSA and approved by the White House, that master key will be split into two pieces, one held in safe
keeping at the Commerce Department, the other at Treasury [the Yale key splits in two on either side of the Clipper Chip].  Law
enforcement agencies will need a court order before they can get
access to the keys.  Unauthorized use of Clipper keys will be a felony, punishable by up to 5 years in jail.
"There will be no vulnerability there that can be exploited by,
say, a rogue law enforcement agency or by a hostile outsider, to
compromise the keys that will be ... that will allow authorized people to unlock the key escrow encryption cryptography."
"But privacy advocates aren't so sure.  Like Marc Rotenberg of
Computer Scientists [sic] for Social Responsibility, they see
Clipper as an attempt by the NSA to block people from using
cryptography to keep their affairs to themselves.  They're asking
people to register their objections by computer."  [Screen displaying graph with sharply increasing number of responses "Here we have on the screen a letter to the President.  And we
ask them to simply send a message with the words 'I oppose "Basically, it's a proposal for surveillance.  It's a way to make
it easier to wiretap the network.  And the reason it's such a bad
idea is what we need right now is privacy protection.  We need more secure networks, not more vulnerable networks."
"On these networks, people are logging on to argue the pros and cons of the Clipper proposal.  David Banisar, one of Rotenberg's
colleagues, has been tracking that debate.
DB, 'Computer Privacy Advocate':
"On the Internet, which is the international network of computers,
there's been an incredible amount of discussion.  There's been
thousands of messages posted, hundreds per day.  And it goes on
almost forever.  [Screen showing message list of alt.privacy.clipper.]  The public is going to reject this because, basically, we want a national information infrastructure
where people can communicate.  We don't want a national surveillance infrastructure, where the main purpose is for the
government to be able to control and watch over what we're doing
all the time."
"It may sound like spies vs nerds.  But at the heart of the Clipper debate is a fundamental question of Constitutional rights.
One side thinks that people have a basic right to use the most powerful encryption tools they can get their hands on to keep their affairs private.  The other thinks that that right must be superseded by the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  There
are cryptographers on both sides of the debate."
Dorothy Denning, Georgetown University:
"I think it would be folly to let the capability to do electronic
surveillance be completely overridden by technology, so that we couldn't do that.  I think it's a much safer bet to put it into
the system so that we can do it, to make sure that we have good procedural checks and laws and so on to govern the use of that so
it's checked.  And if it's misused, to make sure that it's properly dealt with."
Whitfield Diffie, Sun Microsystems:
"If you say to people that they, as a matter of fact, can't protect their conversations, and in particular their political conversations, I think you take a long step toward making a transition from a free society to a totalitarian society."
"Meanwhile, the Clipper Chip is moving full speed ahead."

selling a variety of telephones with the chips built in, including
this device which it is producing for the government to protect the privacy of phone calls within the Justice Department [shot of
AT&T Surity Telephone Device 3600 (crypto brick)].  But it's not
at all clear that the devices will find a market outside the government.  Some of Clipper's most vocal opponents are the very
computer and telecommunications firms the government hopes will
adopt it.  [The following Logos appear:  Apple, IBM, Microsoft,
Prodigy, Sun, HP, Digital, Lotus, Oracle].  Their gripe centers
on the US export laws that make it illegal to sell encryption systems abroad.  To encourage US companies to use the government's
system, the administration has lifted those export controls for Clipper, but only for Clipper."
Jerry Berman, Electronic Frontier Foundation:
"You're going to thwart our foreign markets, because no foreign
country and no foreign person is going to use a device that's made by NSA and where the keys are held by a US government "As the lines are strung to carry the traffic of the emerging information highway, the greatest fear of privacy advocates is
that Clipper may be only the first step down a path that leads to
more and more government snooping.  They point to a new bill the Administration is circulating on Capitol Hill --- the so-called 'Digital Telephony Bill' --- that would require phone and cable companies to provide the government with systemwide access to even more information."
"It is absolutely clear, if you look over the last three to four
years of the FBI's proposals and the proposals from the National Security Agency, that there is a plan --- in steps --- to restrict the use of cryptography in the United States.  There's
a plan to ensure that communication networks are designed to facilitate wire surveillance.  And there's every reason to believe after Clipper goes forward, after the Digital Telephony
proposal goes forward, that the next step will be to restrict non-compliant cryptography."
"In real life --- or 'RL', as computer buffs call it --- it's
often not clear where to draw the line between the rights of the
individual and the needs of society.  [Telephoto sidewalk shot showing masses of humanity.]  It's no different in cyberspace ---
that world of interconnected computers, where messages fly back and forth on video screens [Screens showing US West Community Link  Service, Minitel, Medline, American Interactive Technologies, PC Flowers, and Arcade].  Experts say that the new
information super highway will have to have some rules of the road.  The hard part is deciding where and how to draw them."

(Details of secured credit card system elided)
The Feds agree which is why they outlawed such transactions.  "Banks" have
to comply with "know your customer" rules.  Civilians may not realize it
but a VISA account is just a bank account like any other save that it
usually has a debit balance rather than a credit balance.  Issuers have to
obtain taxpayer ID numbers from their customers and identification
information "similar to what a bank would require to cash a check".
This rule has been extended throughout the OECD countries by recent
treaty.  Even outside the OECD, card issuers have to be conservative
because many VISA merchants are not online and one could run up a lot of
little transactions if one were interested in card fraud.  The issuer
would be stuck.  Once all transactions can be verified online, this may

Yet another data point for tracking the conversion of governments to market actors from last week's Economist:
On March 24th at the behest of the Mexican government, the SEC ordered US securities markets to suspend trading in the shares of Mexican companies after the recent political assasination.  The NYSE complied.  The NASDAQ refused.  Shares started trading with a one-hour delay.
"With finance globalized, governments can seldom block the operation of markets.  Nor should they try to.  Few would now suggest closing the foreign-exchange markets, as in the 1960s.  In a 24-hour global market, traders and investors could simply shift their business elsewhere."
"We'd better hope that strong cypto, cheap telecoms and free markets can provide the organizing basis for a workable society because it is clear that coercion as an organizing principle ain't what it used to be."

A quote from pgpdoc1.doc:
 "If privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will have privacy.  Intelligence
     agencies have access to good cryptographic technology.  So do the big
     arms and drug traffickers.  So do defense contractors, oil companies,
     and other corporate giants.  But ordinary people and grassroots
     political organizations mostly have not had access to affordable
     "military grade" public-key cryptographic technology.  Until now."
Now Phil wrote PGP in part so that "grassroots" political organizations could have strong crypto.  SOF is a "grassroots political organization."  It happens that some people don't like SOF.  It happens that some other people think that the organizations that Phil was thinking of when he wrote PGP are unamerican communist front organizations who should be on the Attorney General's List (if we still had an Attorney General's List)(if we still had an Attorney General).  Tastes differ.
The point of cypherpunks is that everyone (even FBI agents) should have strong crypto if they want it.
I know that Phil feels a personal sense of embarrassment at being adopted by all sorts of nut groups (including ourselves) and he has pleaded for stories of "worthy PGP use."  Standards of worthiness will vary.

The existence of ATM networks gives the IRS no info that they didn't have in, say, 1965 except your physical movements if you use them a lot.  If you used to cash or use a lot of checks in the past, they could "follow" you that way as well.
What *does* give them (and everyone else) extra powers are the new "voice mail" account information systems that use the SS# as a PIN.  Anyone can use those to spy on your account.
As always, accounts not in your True Name or in another country are much harder to link to you.

In the case of a forged drawer's signature (forged signature of the account holder) on a check, the bank that pays on the forgery is liable.  This is because in theory a check is an order to your bank to pay on your order and a forgery is not a valid order from you.
If a check is paid based on a forged *endorsement* on the other hand, the transaction can be walked back until the person who first accepted the forged endorsement is stuck with the loss.

The American social psychologist Stanley Milgram, b.  New York City, Aug.  15,1933, d.  Dec.  20, 1984, gained wide recognition for the experiments described in his book. Obedience to Authority (1974).  In one, "technicians" urged participants to give a series of electric shocks of increasingly higher voltage to "subjects" who had incorrectly answered questions.  About 60 percent compiled.  No voltage was actually applied:  the subjects were actors who feigned agony. Milgram took the results as proof that ordinary people will inflict pain on innocent people when commanded by an authoritative figure.

The subjects were very upset during and after the experiment.  Some broke down while administering "lethal" shocks.  They often cried and begged the "researcher" to let them stop zapping the victim.  In those cases where a white coated researcher with a clipboard was standing behind them, the subject was much more likely to impose greater shocks than if there was no "researcher" present.
The main reason they did it is because they were being told to.  Primates have a hard time disobeying authority figures or standing out from the crowd. "Help the Homeless -- Teach them how to sell their identities."

I've worried about the same thing myself.  The best way to fight these
tendancies is to "follow the tracks back to the barn."  Uncover the
illusion and place it in context.  Whenever I visited Disneyland, I used
to follow all the tracks back to the barns.  Most of the rides there are
rail vehicles even the submarine ride.  You can see the reality of the
place by observing the tracks.
In the case of experiments like this you can be aware of the existence of
the researcher and avoid trusting him.  In the larger world, you can keep
a death's grip on reality and note that people giving you orders are just
men who have their own reasons for doing things.  Trace the power
relationships back to the barn.
Never be afraid to jinx sideways to throw them off your tail.  Practice
violating small orders so that when it really counts, you'll be able to
violate big orders smoothly without even having to think about it.
Not to attack others facing a different world but how many jews could have
saved themselves during the 1930s by choosing to become illegal aliens in
the US or the UK.  Practice disobedience.
Privacy 101 -- Don't get a driver's license from the state or country

having one could easily save your life someday.  You can drive a car in

@ approx :20 past the first/third hour
Bob Edwards (?):
... in the age of digital communication: the debate over encryption
technology ... first, headlines from Carl Castle ....
[Headline News]
The new era of digital communication has brought with it some very thorny
problems concerning personal privacy.  Three months ago, the Clinton
administration announced a new encryption technology, called the "Clipper
Chip" --- a device that encodes voice communications so that eavesdroppers
can't understand what's being said.  Privacy advocates are angry because
the government will keep the keys to the Clipper Chip code, enabling the
National Security Agency and the FBI to listen in.  Critics say the
Clipper policy will threaten privacy in the soon-to-be-deployed information
technology on which the messages will include very personal documents and
highly sensitive business communications.  Next week, committees in both
the Senate and the House will hold hearings on the controversy.  NPR's
John McChesney (sp) reports.
Today's digital encryption technology is so good that it's made law
enforcement officials fearful that they're about to lose the wire tapping
capabilities they already have.  That's the reason the Clinton
administration has proposed new technology that will keep law enforcement
in the loop, so to speak.  Clipper is part of what the administration
hopes will become a new encryption standard.  Jeff Greibledinger heads
the Justice Department's Narcotics Division.
Clipper can be put into telephone or fax or similar hardware and provides
extraordinarily strong encryption, using an algorithm that's been in use
by the government now for a number of years.
Two people conversing will be able to activate Clipper encryption on
their telephones, so that to an eavesdropper their conversation will be
meaningless gibberish.  In fact, Clipper's code is so complex, the
government says it needs to keep the key, so that it can unlock the
code and listen in if it thinks the laws are being broken.  Thus the
controversy, and there's a virtual canyon of difference between the
government and privacy advocates, with both sides painting dark,
disturbing visions of our digital future.  Federal officials warn that
the information super highway could become a lawless road, travelled
by terrorist conspirators and kiddie porn merchants peddling their
sordid wares over global networks, while lawmen are left standing by
in uncomprehending helplessness.  Civil libertarians, on the other
hand, foresee a nearly omniscient government able to dip at will into
the digital pipelines and pull up data containing the most intimate
details of our personal and professional lives.
The problem with cyberspace is that essentially every time you do
anything there, you leave some kind of data trail.
John Perry Barlow writes about digital technology for Wired Magazine.
In the physical world, you've got walls and doors that you can lock.
But, you know, in the virtual world everything you do is visible except
that which you explicitly make invisible.  And the only way in which
you can make things invisible is by using cryptography.  And the only
way in which you can make them invisible to the government is by
using the strong cryptography that they don't want you to have.
The government may not *want* you to have strong encryption, but so
far it hasn't said that you *can't* have it.  Strong, private
encryption software, to which the government will *not* have a key,
will still be available on the domestic market.  Administration
spokesmen insist that Clipper, and other government data encryption
standards yet to come, will be strictly voluntary.  But that's a
straddle that appears to have satisfied no one.  Critics say that
nobody with criminal intentions would be stupid enough to use the
codes that the government has keys to.  And others say that the
administration is being disingenuous --- that it's using the levers
of government to ensure that Clipper becomes *the* standard.  One
such skeptic is Jerry Berman of the Electronic Frontiers Foundation.
The government, while it says it's a voluntary system, they are
determined to drive the market, to use government buying power to
make this a defacto standard.  If every government agency, the IRS,
Treasury, and the Health Care System use Clipper Chip, there will
be a tremendous market incentive to move towards Clipper as a
potential standard.  Second of all, they are making it very difficult
for other encryption schemes to compete on the market by continuing
to hold that any powerful encryption scheme available in the United
States cannot be exported.  It's a munition.  It's a weapon.
The export restriction has infuriated the American software industry,
which says it stands to lose more than $6 billion each year it's in
effect.  But it's the potential loss of privacy, rather than the
loss of profit, that will undoubtedly remain at the center of the
Clipper debate.  Government backers of Clipper say there are sufficient
legal restraints now in place to prevent illegal invasions of our
privacy.  Again, the Justice Department's Jeff Greibledinger:
A wiretap without lawful authorization is a Federal felony offense,
punishable by up to five years in prison.  That's true right now, even
for unencrypted communications.  It will be no less true in the future,
when encryption is available.
Greibledinger says the Clipper system would make it even harder for
government officials to gather information illegally.  They key to
each Clipper chip's code will be split into two parts, which will be
held in escrow by two separate government agencies.  A wiretap order
would have to include separate, documented applications to these two
agencies for the keys.  But skeptics say that the excesses of the FBI
under J. Edgar Hoover should be kept in mind during this debate.  They
also point out that modern digital technology is changing the terms of
the debate about privacy.  In the first place, there will be a lot
more information about our private lives on the networks of the future
than there is on the phone lines of today.  And secondly, as critics
like Jerry Berman point out, powerful computers connected to digital
networks greatly increase the efficiency of spying, making it possible
instantly to pull together a detailed personal portrait of any citizen.
What kind mail you're sending and to whom
What kind of telephone calls you're making and to whom
What kind of banking transactions and where you are, and
What kind of vacation you're taking and
What kind of movies you're watching --- all at the same time.
And all of the information surging through the digital pipelines of the
future can be far more easily searched than could the mail and telephone
calls of the past.  Stanford Professor Martin Hellman, a noted pioneer
in cryptographic technology, who opposes Clipper, says old-time wire
taps required an expensive human being to monitor each and every call.
But once you have information in computer readable form, you can scan
approximately 10 billion words for $1.  You heard me right --- 10 billion
words for $1!  So the fact that we're going to computer readable
information makes this much more dangerous.
Vermont's Senator Patrick Leahy heads a Senate Technology Sub-Committee
that will hold hearings on the Clipper chip next week.  He worries that
concern about Clipper could slow down the deployment of the broadband
communications networks the administration has been promoting.
We've had already some 48,000 people sign on to an electronic petition
through Internet to say they're against it.  The administration has set
off alarms that probably they didn't need to set off, in some instances.
Because I don't think that they laid the groundwork for this at all.
And in some other areas, they've set off alarms that so far do not have
adequate answers.
Nearly everyone agrees that the stakes in this debate are high --- finding
the proper balance point between privacy and public safety in the digital
age.  Some observers believe that the Clinton administration may be
softening its stand on Clipper now.  Administration spokesmen are
emphasizing that they've solicited alternative ideas from the computer
and software industries.  In San Francisco, I'm John McChesney reporting.
The time is 29 minutes past the hour.

Note that we have had telephones for more than 100 years without any
licensing of telephones in this country.  In fact, the telephone companies
were prohibited from denying service save on a number of narrow grounds.
And that was in a much tighter regulatory environment than seems destined to

They finally got to me.  after fretting for years about how (melanin-rich)
hordes of illegal aliens were poised to steal *my* job, I've decided that
something has to be done.
The turning point came this morning while reading about the report of the
Commission on Immigration Reform.  They have proposed a brilliant idea -- a
national registry of the names and SS numbers of all *Real* Americans (as
well as those sneaky legal aliens) so that employers can (would have to)
verify that their prospective employees are legal.
Since this is such a fabulous idea, I thought that we might help out by
creating a Social Security Number Server on the nets to make valid names and
SS numbers available to *everyone*.  Nice WWW interface with forms support,
etc.  After all, since it's such a good thing to do, we should *help* the
Feds by doing more of it.
As you may know, there's a guy on alt.privacy who has been collecting SS
numbers for a while (a perfectly legal activity).  I will be contacting him
to see if he would be interested in contributing the numbers that he has

Bearer bonds are not illegal in the US.
Under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), any
interest payments made on *new* issues of domestic bearer bonds are not
deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense so none have been
issued since then.  At the same time, the Feds administratively stopped
issuing treasury securities in bearer form.  Old issues of government and
corporate debt in bearer form still exist and will exist and trade for 30 or
more years after 1982.  Additionally, US residents can legally buy foreign
bearer securities.

The instructions on the back of the "Landing Card" given to travelers
entering the US *are* deceptive.
The law on reporting the import/export of currency requires that anyone who
imports or exports more than $10,000 in "currency or monetary instruments"
has to file a report with the Feds.
"Currency" is currency.  "Monetary instruments" are monetary instruments in
bearer form such that their value can be transfered to *any* other person
just by handing them over.  Examples include:
1)  Checks or other drafts made payable to 'cash' or 'bearer'.
2)  Checks endorsed by the payee without restriction (that means just signed
on the back.)
3)  Blank travelers checks.
4)  Double signed travelers checks.
These are all "cash substitutes."
Checks made payable to a specific party (Bank of Butterfield, Bermuda for
example); travelers checks with just your single signature on them;
$100,000,000 SWIFT wires from Citicorp in NYC to Swiss Bank Corp, Panama
City, Panama need *not* be reported.
The instructions on the back of the Landing Card, however, mention checks
and travelers checks in such a way that they unwary might think that they
have to file reports on their travelers checks they are carrying along or on
the $50,000 that they just wired to Switzerland.
The Feds are trying to get banks to report wire transfers but the banks are
Just a note further on the discussion about checks made payable to 'cash'.
These are no different than checks endorsed by the payee without restriction
(signed on the back).  Every time you just endorse a check, you have
converted it into a bearer instrument.  Perfectly legal.
Note too that there are currently no restrictions on the use of cash in
transactions or the transfer of unlimited amouts of cash into and out of the
country.  There are reporting requirements and if the cash represents
'unlawful proceeds' money laundering laws may apply.  The acts themselves
are legal though.

All businesses in the US have to report cash transactions of more than $10K.
They have to keep records (but not report) on cash transactions of $3K or more.
While the cash import/export rules require reporting only of "currency or
monetary instruments" as I defined them in my last message, the domestic
reports of cash transactions now include (in addition to currency and
monetary instruments) the requirement to report $10K transactions involving
cashier's checks, money orders and other instruments that can be purchased
anonymously and are not connected with a specific bank account.  This is a
significant expansion of the definition of "cash".  It may spread to the
import/export realm later.

Ah, the eternal Common Carrier debate.  The answer is the same as the last
few times.  "Common Carrier" status has little to do with exemption from
liability.  It has most to do with being unable to reject passengers, goods,
or phone calls.
The EFF would like the NII to be a common carrier so that 'the poor' could
get 'free' connections, most of the libertarians here would not.
Plenty of non-common carrier entities are immune from prosecution for ideas
that they unkowingly communicate -- bookstores for example (unless they are
*knowingly* porno bookstores in the wrong jurisdiction).  Compuserve was
held not liable for an (alleged) libel by one of its sysops.  Not because of
coomon carrier but because they had no knowledge or control.
Remailers have no knowledge or control hence no scienter (guilty knowledge)
hence no liability as a matter of law -- not a jury question BTW.

couldn't be broken, she couldn't be kidnapped in the first place" reply.  The "force field" is a fair analogy to crypto  since, as Tim May, has
argued, the energy cost necessary to break strong cypto is the equivalent of
a journey to the end of the universe and back (or whatever).
"Shield" displays the attitudinal differences between control freaks and
libertarians (like Poul Anderson) quite well.  Impenetrable shields scare
control freaks and give hope to believers in personal autonomy.
Also, the climax of "Shield" includes a decades-old version of the technique
that some members of cypherpunks have used to solve secrecy problems --
uploading the "secret" document to the nets to forestall censorship.
"Who for decades hoped for the two inventions that would bring about a de
facto free society without having to change anybody's politics -- a force
field or a $5 a pound orbital launch system -- but who never predicted the
direction from which Liberation Technology would sneak up on him."

Brad -- perhaps you haven't grasped the full range of possibilities arising
from the deployment of modern crypto technology.
By the use of Stego and anonymous networking and operating system software,
it will be possible to block the authorities from even identifying you as
the target of an investigation.  While it is true that they may be able to try and force you to reveal the
contents of a "secret message", they can succeed only if:
1)  They know that a secret message exists
2)  They know that you exist
3)  They know (and can prove) that you possess the key material necessary to
decode the message.
4)  You are capable of being coerced -- i.e. you are a human being and not a
software agent or an institutional entity controlled by humans outside of
the jurisdiction.
5)  You are within their jurisdiction.
6)  You have not used an encoding scheme that kicks out two alternative
plaintexts (the 'real message' and the 'duress message') depending on what
key material you use.
7)  You decide not to take advantage of their offer of one or two years of
free room and board rather than submit to their demands.
Modern crypto techniques can make it very difficult in practice to extract
any useful information from people's computer files or communication
streams.  At the least, crypto can make "fishing expeditions" impossible.
When you combine crypto with the fact that on a network, people inside and
outside the "jurisdiction" are equal, enforcement capabilities are reduced.

There is no such thing as a false name.  You can still call yourself
anything you like (and spell it any way).  If you are trying to pretend to
be another actual person, there may be fraud involved.  No one's busted the
Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus -- Kawize(sp?) Infume -- for
using a name other than his birth name.
The issuers of secured credit cards vary in the amount of info they want
about you.  Citibank's secured credit card app asks for almost as much info
as their normal app.  Some secure card issuers just want to know your name
address and SS   The overseas issuers of bank debit Visa cards don't want
your SS# but usually these days want a bank reference. Using a nome de guerre and an accomodation address is not fraud.  They asked
for your name and address and you supplied it.  It is an interesting
question as to whether or not using a phoney SS# would be fraud.  This is
particularly uncertain if the bank would have issued you a secured credit
card even if you gave your "real" SS  If you are just trying to protect
your privacy, and not trying to induce the bank to do anything that it would
not have done anyway, is there fraud since the "lie" is not material to the
granting of credit in the case of secured credit cards?  It will not come up
in any case.
Note too that the SS# requirement is there not because the bank wants it but
because the *government* requires it.  (A credit card account is actually a
bank account.)  You are not lying to the credit card issuer but to the State
that is forcing them to invade your privacy.   Lying to the government is
not fraud because you (or I at least) am not attempting to get anything of
value from them.
The "Necessity Defense" can always be used to justify lying to the government.

An advanced telecommunications environment offers a number of ways to
protect yourself against the problems involved in dealing with anonymous

case 'G' to spell Government when we are speaking of The Great Enemy and a
lower case 'g' to refer to things like self government or corporate
government or engine government.)
When one's PBX finds that one's call is not going through via a particular
long distance carrier, it automatically switches to another one.  It is easy
to imagine one's intelligent agents testing various sorts of transaction
completions and switching vendors when one fails.  Professional checkers can
supply information on vendor status for a fee.  After all, we don't care if
a company we are dealing with changes if its service is unaffected.  Eric Hughes is working on another approach, an Open Books protocol which
will let companies post anonymous but checkable sets of accounts which can
be accessed by anyone on the nets, can't be easily spoofed but give no
private info to anyone else.  Sort of Zero Knowledge Proof Bookkeeping.
(Could we call this triple-entry bookkeeping?)
It is important to note in any case that the use of third-party escrow as a
substitute for Government regulation was a feature of the Northern European
semi-anarchies of Iceland and Ireland that have informed modern libertarian
thought.  I doubt that my old Poli Sci prof Don Balmer would consider an
escrow company to be the equivalent of the Government of the United States.

CODING UP A BIT OF PRIVACY
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.
This must be how the Founding Fathers looked when they hacked out the Constitution :
A roomful of young men, mostly--frazzled hair, eager eyes, wild beards,
arms flailing and fingers jabbing in air, reaching for big ideas.  You
can't help but feel it; urgency tempers their voices.  The earnest men plan and argue in this corporate conference room as the last sun rays of
a winter Saturday afternoon fade in through a skylight.
Time is running out for the Cypherpunks.
There is much work to be done before the information highway arrives.
The information highway --- that 500-channel shopping mall/cineplex
championed by cable and telephone companies --- is a noxious concept to
the people in this room.  They are not technophobes or Luddites, these
Cypherpunks,  Instead, they are a collection of clever computer programmers, engineers and wire heads from some of the nation's best-known Silicon Valley software houses and hardware shops.
This is their central question:  In a future world where all information is centralized on a network, where all information is tracked by the bit, where every purchase you make and every communication can be monitored by corporate America, how does privacy survive?  If you go to the bookstore now and buy a book, you can pay in cash.  No one knows your name or what you purchased.  "What happens to cash transactions on the information highway?" they ask.
The Cypherpunks believe that they can preserve your privacy through good cyphers, or codes.  But they must hurry, must get their codes out and their networks up and running.
"The whole information highway thing is now part of the public eye," explain Eric Hughes, a founder of the Cypherpunk movement.  "If we don't change it now, it'll be impossible later."  The Cypherpunks know what technology is capable of.  We visit them today because they represent one edge of the national debate on the structure of the information highway.  And as we all know, extreme positions help define the middle.
Many of the Cypherpunks have been heavy Internet users for years and hope to preserve the communal spirit of that freewheeling world of interconnected computer networks.  They dread the coming commercial network of televisions and computers, saying it will displace the Internet and destroy many of the freedoms they now enjoy.
So the Cypherpunks, with the kind of zeal they professionally bring to marathon, 72-hour sessions hacking computer code, are plotting to keep free networks alive.  That's "free" in the sense of unfettered, unmonitored, uncensored.
One way they're going about it is by spreading easy-to-use, cheap cryptography.  Cryptography is the science of keeping two-way communication private.  Computers, it turns out, are revolutionary cryptographic tools, able to encode and decode files quickly.  For the first time, virtually unbreakable codes are now possible, thanks to The Cypherpunks post cryptographic software on the Internet where anyone can access it, and can encode their communications, including electronic mail, pictures and video.
The the U.S. government is concerned, as governments always are, about the spread of powerful cryptography (terrorists could use it, kidnappers could use it, drug dealers could use it, all of them on cellular phones that encode conversations).  It currently is pushing its own commercial cryptographic standard, through a special chip known as the Clipper.  The chip is reviled by Cypherpunks and other civil libertarians because it provides a back door that law-enforcement agencies could enter, with the proper warrants, for surveillance.
By getting good, unbreakable cryptography out there now, the Cypherpunks hope, whatever the government finally decides will be moot.
Software has a wonderful property, the Cypherpunks are fond of saying:  Once it's created, it can never be destroyed.  It can be copied infinitely, from computer to computer, spreading like a secret.  Come what may, unbreakable Cypherpunk code, and Cypherpunk networks, will be out there forever, they hope.  But just to be safe, the Cypherpunks are toying with different network-related plans to create an economy of "digicash" --- network money that, like the dollars in your pocket, isn't tied to a user's credit cards or other personal identification.  Digicash will help pay for Cypherpunk networks and will allow people to purchase goods without revealing their identity.
"I'm starting a bank, and it's not going to be a U.S. bank," Hughes says.  He standing at the whiteboard now.  A strawberry-blond ponytail dangles down his back and he grasps a magic marker in his hand.  "We have several long-term strategies, one of which is the elimination of central banks."  He tells the assembled crowd what they already know.  Heads nod.  Some people take notes.
Hughes is a self-employed programmer in Berkeley.  His hand flies across the whiteboard, sketching out a schematic diagram, showing how his bank will operate.  The bank will store depositors' money (he's thinking a $200 minimum deposit) and disburse payments to anyone --- all over the Internet.  It will be based abroad, maybe in Mexico.  A Cypherpunk network bank is one way to pay for a network of truly encrypted, private communications, you see.
"Is this going to lead the way to portable laptop ATM machines?" someone else asks.
"First Bank of Cyberspace!" yells one person.
"First Internet bank!" yells another.
"The Nth National Bank!"
Laughter.  Billy goat beards bob.
There is much work to be done.

Communications intercepts are rarely used to prosecute crimes.

Along with lots of other nice things.  Computers have been killing traditional banks for years (ever since they enabled the creation of Money Market Funds in the '70s).  Netbank (and its many competitors) will continue the process.

An interesting article in the London Daily Telegraph (today's?):
(Keyboarding by my daughter Tiia) Neo-Nazis Salute Computer Technology
Computer technology is transforming Germany's disparate neo-Nazi scene into a unified movement by granting instant access to a central information system co-ordinating demonstrations and disseminating propaganda, according to a senior intelligence official.
Herr Ernst Uhrlau, head of Hamburg's office for the protection of the
constitution, said:  "German's RIght wing is taking up the character of a
Until now, we have only seen this in the Left wing, but the various
Righ-wing groups, who all yearn for hierarchy and leadership, are using
modern communications systems such as computers, mail boxes and information telephones to co-ordinate their activities."
Herr Uhrlau, whose office gathers intelligence on activities likely to
undermine state security, said that it was only by using mobile
communications networks that the Right wing was able to hold illegal rallies in 1992 and 1993 on the anniversary of the death of Rudolf Hess, Hitler's deputy.
He was also concerned about the infiltration of univeristy student
fraternities by Right-wing ideologues who were spreading their views
through notice boards, pamphlets, and newspapers.
The chief co-ordinators of German's Right-wing movement work through a
national computer network named "Thule", after the small elite 1920s
movement which preceded the Nazi party.
It consists of at least 12 "mailbox" computer lines linked to a national
network on which individuals can exchange messages and receive information.  The system is designed to be accessed only by bona fide political sympathisers.
To join the inner circle, you much leave your name, telephone number and
address, according to the monthly computer magazine Chip, which has
pentrated the Thule network.
Only if you pass a loyalty test while being questioned on the phone will you be given the full access codes.
Chip belives that 1,500 of Germany's 42,000 Righ-wing extremists use the
Thule network which, apart from co-ordinating demonstrations, gives out
information on such matters as how to start your own newspapers or make a
bomb [Both equally illegal activities in the BRD -- Editor's note].
Police have so far found it impossible to discover who is running any of the notice boards, since much of the information is only available for a brief period and suppliers use pseudonyms.
Thule also provides an international link.
Of particular concern to the authorities are connections with Gary Lauck,
self-proclaimed head of America's neo-Nazis, whose organisation in Nebraska is believed to be behind the mailing of a computer disk called "Endsieg" (Final Victory) which contains bomb-making instructions.

SINK THE CLIPPER CHIP
Well-meaning law and intelligence officials, vainly seeking to maintain
their vanishing ability to eavesdrop, have come up with a scheme that
endangers the personal freedom of every American.
Nobody doubts that F.B.I. wiretaps help catch crooks or that the National
Security Agency's "Big Ears" alert us to the plans of terrorists.  And
nobody can deny that new technology makes it easier for the bad guys to
encode their communications to avoid the eavesdropping of the good guys.
But the solution that faceless Clinton officials are putting forward shows
outdated law enforcement rooted in abysmal understanding of the information explosion.
The Clinton notion, recycled from an aborted Bush idea, is to put the same
encryption chip; in every telephone and computer made in the U.S.  This
new encoding device, or scrambler, would help you and me protect the
privacy of our conversations and messages and bank accounts from each other.  That sounds great, but here comes the catch:  The Federal Government would know and be able to use the code numbers to wiretap each of us.
To the tune of "I Got Algorithm," the Eavesdrop Establishment is singing that it will help us protect our privacy --- but not from intrusion by the Feds.  In effect, its proposal demands we turn over to Washington a duplicate set of keys to our homes, formerly our castles, where not even the king in olden times could go.
The "clipper chip" --- aptly named, as it clips the wings of individual
liberty --- would encode, for Federal perusal whenever a judge rubber-
stamped a warrant, everything we say on a phone, everything we write on a
computer, every order we give to a shopping network or bank or 800 or 900
number, every electronic note we leave our spouses or dictate to our
personal-digit-assistant genies.
Add to that stack of intimate date the medical information derived from
the national "health security card" Mr. Clinton proposes we all carry.
Combine it with the travel, shopping and credit data available from all
our plastic cards, along with psychological and student test scores.
Throw in the confidential tax returns, sealed divorce proceedings, welfare
records, field investigations for job applications, raw files and C.I.A.
dossiers available to the Feds, and you have the individual citizen
standing naked to the nosy bureaucrat.
Assure us not that our personal life stories will be "safeguarded" by
multiple escrows in the brave new world of snooperware; we saw only last

unmonitored Japanese or German or Indian encryption chips and laugh all
the way to the plutonium factory.

Billions now spent on passive technical surveillance must be shifted to
active means of learning criminal or aggressive plans.  Human informers
must be recruited or placed, as "sigint" declines and "humint" rises in
the new era; psychic as well as monetary rewards for ratting must be
raised; governments must collude closely to trace transfers of wealth.
Cash in your clipper chips, wiretappers:  you can't detect the crime wave
of the future with those old earphones on.

Ideas & Trends
Cyberspace Under Lock And Key
By  John Markoff
SAN FRANCISCO
In Silicon Valley some of the country's best computer hackers are talking
about acts of civil disobedience in cyberspace.
Their target is a plan by the Federal Government to discourage a
proliferation of coding schemes that insure electronic conversations are
private -- from everyone including the authorities.  Under a plan being
pushed by the Clinton Administration, the computer industry would be
strongly encouraged to adopt a new data scrambling standard, embodied in
a device called the Clipper Chip, that would allow law enforcement
agencies, armed with court orders, to eavesdrop on electronic Earlier this month, Vice President Al Gore said the proposed standard was an important law and order issue for the Administration.  The danger, he
warned, is that unchecked computer coding technology will make it possible
for terrorists and criminals to have secret electronic conversations.
The White House is also pressing for legislation that would require
telephone networks, cable companies and wireless communications services
to install systems that allow law enforcers to listen in.
While the Clipper system is voluntary today, a coalition of Silicon Valley
business executives and civil liberties advocates argues that there is no
guarantee that it won't be made mandatory by a future Administration.
In the meantime, it could become a de facto standard as companies that
want to do Government business would have to install the chips in their
products.  Furthermore the Government could use existing export laws to
require Clipper chips in any computers shipped to other countries.
"They're asking us to ship millions of computers abroad with a chip stamped J. Edgar Hoover inside," said John Gage, director of the science office at Sun Microsystems Inc., a maker of computer work stations based in Mountain View, Calif.  "We refuse to do it."
A Silicon Valley group called Cypherpunks, which wants to make free and
powerful cryptography available to the masses, has been discussing ways to
trick officials into thinking the keys to the Clipper code have been
stolen.  Others are considering violating export restriction laws by
sending thousands of copies of encoding software out of the country over
the Internet.
In fact, the ability to devise coding schemes -- unbreakable even by the
most powerful supercomputers -- is so widespread that trying to impose
a universal standard may be like trying to enforce Prohibition.  Home-
brew coding software can be easily exported by electronic rumrunners on
computer disks or instantly sent over electronic networks to any city in
the world.
With Clipper, which was developed by the National Security Agency,
communications are mathematically scrambled with an unbreakable code, but
an extra set of two keys -- actually long numbers -- would permit
authorized third parties to listen in, with the same restrictions that
now apply to wiretapping.
As a safeguard, both keys would be required to monitor conversations.  But
some opponents argue that the system could still be abused by Government
officials or clever hackers who are able to steal the code.
They also point out that despite claims that Clipper is necessary for
national security, no other foreign Government or foreign company has
indicated that it is willing to use a coding system that is breakable
by the United States spying agencies.  Even close allies like Canada
and Britain have said they are not willing to adopt Clipper.
Last week, Michael Nelson, an Administration official in charge of
technology policy, broadcast an electronic mail message over the Internet
to reassure computer users that the Government has no intention of
enforcing mandatory encryption.  But skeptics remain unpersuaded.  "They
are utterly transfixed with the horrible vision of the nuclear armed
terrorist," said John Perry Barlow, a founder of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, a public interest computer group that is campaigning to stop
the Clipper chip.  "This is the last ditch effort of the old superpowers
trying to establish imperial control over  cyberspace."
Across the Internet, activists are discussing civil disobedience
strategies while mainstream groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation
and the Computer Scientists for Social Responsibility are organizing a
lobbying attempt against Clipper.
But some hackers aren't waiting for the government to back down.  They're
pressing ahead with their networks.  A programmer named Philip Zimmerman
has written free software called Pretty Good Privacy for protecting
electronic mail messages.  The program touched off a Justice Department
investigation after it was sent overseas through international networks.
Now Mr. Zimmerman is working on another free program that will allow
personal computers, equipped with microphones, speakers and conventional
high-speed modems, to act as secure telephones, allowing their users to
have private conversations that can't be overheard.  This promises to be
about as popular with Clipper supporters as radar detectors are with the
highway patrol.
"They were angry about Pretty Good Privacy," said Mr. Zimmerman.  "They're
going to go ballistic over this."

Encryption alone will absolutely protect the 99.99% of communications that are never the subject of any government disclosure orders.  Investigations take *serious* money.

Since much of their attention will necessarily be on others, the members of this list -- much less the general public -- have little to worry about.
What's the big deal.  Dan White emptied his revolver into the Mayor of the City of San Francisco, reloaded, and then emptied it again into the body of a member of the Board of Supervisors.  For this crime, he served 5 years and 2 months.  Since nothing we are doing is worse, we can't serve more than that amount of time.  (I know, I know.  Just kidding.)
The criminal justice system is a pretty dull tool, however.  The Feds have lost most of the big political cases that went to trial over the last few years.  They lost all but one of the insider trading cases.  They lost the BCCI case.  They lost the Ollie North prosecution.  They lost the Steve Jackson games case.
In confrontations with the Feds, behave like the guy who was acquitted of insider trading in the Princeton Partners case -- wear a Cat hat reading "Shit Happens" to all the negotiating sessions.
Remember too that in the absence of war, 99.99% of the damage "the government" does to you is actually self inflicted.  Don't obey.  Don't line up.  Don't fill out the proper forms, properly.  Don't give them your right name and address.  Keep fixed in your mind the words of the first rebel, a fallen angel, who said, "Non Servatum" (I will not serve).

In a recent post, Carl Ellison  opined:
PM has already responded pointing out that cryptography makes such things
more convenient and this is certainly true.  It is much easier to participate in real free markets if secrecy is cheap and easy.
There is another aspect however that is tied up with crypto and telecoms.
In traditional Black Markets, the transactions are illegal.  In future Black Markets on the nets, most of the transactions will be legal.  Legality certainly encourages transactions relative to illegality.
If I am a non-US citizen resident in a tax-haven jurisdiction, I have no US tax liability for my non-US source income.  I also have no tax liability in the haven jurisdiction as long as I wasn't working in that economy.  This was OK in the past if you were a bank or a rich owner of passive income.  You could accumulate it free in a tax haven.  Most people couldn't participate, however.
With commerce on the nets, however, it becomes much cheaper to arrange your affairs (if you are a non-US citizen) such that you have no tax liability.  You may also be able to operate in a much looser regulatory environment.  While it is true that you could accomplish all of the above using traditional technology, the nets mean that you can do it more cheaply (meaning it becomes economically appropriate for more transactions) and in a mainstream market not off to the side in a tropical pesthole.
You can have all the benefits of forum shopping while not giving up access to the richest markets of the OECD countries.  If a Brit or an American chooses to download a financial product, a video, a drug synthesis description file, medical advice, or some other bits of information from you (you being located somewhere on the nets) they may be breaking various laws (depending on the contents of their download) but you may not.
Thus it is legal, today, for an American to purchase an unregistered foreign security but it is illegal for me to promote such a thing domestically.  On the nets, we are all foreign and we are all domestic.  It would be legal to promote the sale of an unregistered foreign security over the nets.  What happens to the SEC?
As I said in London in November (and *think* about this folks):
"And what can we call this new form of social organization growing on the nets and in the modern fluid business environment?  When two or more people can meet together and communicate freely and privately without interference by outsiders, they can trade -- they can form a market.  If this trade on the nets is made free from even the *possibility* of external regulation, what we have is a free market and a free society."
Unless you can block this communication, we've got a market since 90% of the economy will be in non-physical goods and services within a very few Sorry to repeat myself...

You left out a few information purchases: education, much of medicine, all of financial services, design, marketing, supervision, and management.  Note the current tendany to "unbundle" tasks and outsource them to other businesses will tend to encourage the development of "information only" companies.   Once the interface is good enough, virtual offices with full workgroup interaction built of pure information will spring up and the "information" component of much of what we think of as physical work will become I expect information purchases (broadly defined) to reach 90% of our GDP in a few years.  Agriculture once represented 90% of GWP (Gross World Product).  It is now down to the 5% range in the OECD countries.  Yet we eat better than our ancestors.  Goods industries (and real estate sales) can show a similar relative decline.  We will have more "stuff" than ever, it will just be a smaller part of the total economy.
What will cause this growth?  Humans are *thinking* machines.  We exist inside our minds.  We already exist as 100% information.  What we are doing is to map the rest of the world to bring it into congruance with what we already are.  We don't feel as many constraints in our mind as we do in our bodies.  We are deploying our minds to reduce the physical restraints under which we've labored.  (Just a guess...)
In any case, since the restraints are fewer in the non-physical universe than in the physical universe, costs are lower and much of the growth of the economy will be in the non-physical realm.  Certainly the non-physical parts of the economy have grown more than the physical ones in the OECD countries in recent years.  If there is also a *regulatory* difference between the physical and the non-physical worlds, then this switch to the non-physical will be exaserbated.

In the past you had to be in the US to work here but foreigners will soon be able to work for US-based companies as easily as anyone else.  Because of tax savings, they will be able to underbid US workers.  Also companies (or more likely contract services firms) will be able to themselves locate in friendlier jurisdictions and still supply workers (from anywhere on earth to anywhere on earth) to companies that may be in the US or somewhere else.  Remember, under current law it is legal for a US company to hire workers overseas and US taxes are not owed.  There are technical questions of withholding from payments to entities located in non-tax-treaty jurisdictions but these problems can be planned around.  Offshore subsidiaries will also be very cheap to form.
If you wander down the shopping street of a future MUD/MOO and you buy or sell things, what nation has jurisdiction for tax purposes.  What if the MUD/MOO exists as a set of cooperative processes spread around the globe.  There is commerce there but who rules.  The proprietors not any government.  Look at the situation in this country vis a vis state income and sales taxes.

H>thought we were talking about ways to evade laws via cryptography.  Legality is a matter of time and place.  The nets let us pick our time and place.  A non-economic example:
It is a crime for someone in Germany to produce, possess, or transfer "Nazi Material."  It is legal for someone in the US to produce, possess, or transfer "Nazi Material" (substitute other jurisdictions and other "material" to taste).  If I am in Germany and I download "Nazi Material" from the US, no crime has occurred in the US.  A crime may have occurred in Germany but discovery and proof will be very difficult.  Encryption will help here.  Info contraband (which also include things like "unregistered securities" or "American Movies in France") can be produced and accumulated where legal and acquired anywhere else.  Production and distribution remain legal.  In some cases the possession may be illegal but in others (unregistered securities) it won't.
H>My assumption is that governments would actually crack down when faced
H>with lost revenue, similar to what was described as happening in Italy:
If 90% of GWP is on the nets, cracking down will be difficult because there is nothing to seize.  What is happening of economic value on a private, encrypted net?  Who knows or can know?  Enterprise networks (properly designed) will only respond to their owners.  No one else can have a say.
Governments will be reduced to taxing the remaining physical parts of the economy.  Meanwhile, people will be learning what it's like to live in a free society for part of the time (on the nets).  They will not put up with restrictions in their physical life.  They will have assets and attitudes that they can apply to freeing the rest of their lives.  When people turn away from obedience, governments disappear (see the DDR) or at least weaken.
God fights on the side with the heaviest artillery.  Unless you can suggest some sort of artillery that governments could use over fiber optic cable, they will be disarmed in that environment.
In the early 80's when Continental Illinois Bank was going bankrupt, these fun telexes used to arrive every day from Tokyo.  "CANCEL OUR OVERNIGHT DEPOSIT OF $10,000,000.00 EFFECTIVE TODAY".  Suppose that the Feds had sought to seize this money (as governments have in the past).  How do you seize an overnight deposit?  It is gone when cancelled.  Simple bookkeeping entry in Tokyo.

They can know each other.  They can be paid in digital drafts (checks) drawn on the First Internet Bank.  Cash not needed.  Their *nationality* need not be known and will be irrelevent.

Try to enforce this requirement.  In any case, foreigners will not be covered which will give them a real competitive advantage if residents of the high tax nations don't "cheat."
In practice even in our current physical world, small businesses only report 48% of their revenue, the self employed have the lowest rates of individual tax compliance, and 61% of expat Americans do not file US tax returns.  When almost everyone is self-employed or a small business and when regulators can be excluded from transactions by the simple application of crypto technology, compliance will suffer.

People will be drawn to the nets for the games and the thrills (no censorship).  They will start by buying legal and forbidden items there.  Some entrepreneurs will locate there.  Any government restrictions on info will be market opportunities.  Porno almost everywhere, the Asian WSJ in Singapore, non-government TV in India, US movies in France, etc.
The last vestiges of control over money and investments will die.  These sorts of restrictions create market opportunities that traders can arbitrage.  The nets almost eliminate transaction costs.  Government regs on banks, stock markets, telecoms companies, etc. will end.
Once restrictions on types of info or types of money are smashed, the now flush markets on the nets will start to arbitrage the tax structures of nations.  If a transaction costs more because it occurs in a particular jurisdiction and is taxed, people will be able to make money by transferring the transaction (or part of it) to a non-taxed area (the Why hasn't this been done as much before?

S >The middle class avoids current offshore banking because it
S >is user-hostile and puts their life savings at high risk.
The middle class avoids current offshore banking because they want to be close to their money and because they have not (traditionally) had anything to do with foreign investments or even foreign travel (only 14% of Americans possess passports).
S >An offshore bank often takes a week or more to service requests for S >statements sent by snail-mail.
True, although all had telex and have fax and Americans have been able to use telex from their home computers at least since 1983.  Fedex also serves almost all offshore financial centers.
S >Offshore banks are notorious for obsconding with customers' money.
There is no evidence that offshore investment risk is higher than onshore risk (US government deposit insurance not counted).  Recall that you can lose money even in an FDIC insured deposit account in the US as the *average* depositor did over the last 10 years when account interest is adjusted for inflation/opportunity cost.
S >Reputation information on these banks is hard to find to nonexistant.
So if I open an account at the Cayman office of the Bank of Nova Scotia, I have no way of telling that it is safe.  Most of the money in offshore banks is invested in subsidiaries of onshore banks.
There are six major clearing banks in the Cayman Islands: Barclays Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Nova Scotia, CIBC Bank and Trust Company (Cayman) Ltd, Cayman National Bank and Trust Co Ltd, and Bank of
Butterfield (Cayman) Ltd.
Of these, 4 are subsidiaries of major international banks, Bank of Butterfield is a banking subsidiary of one of the largest trust companies in Bermuda (with a good rep), and Cayman National Bank and Trust (a member of the Cirrus ATM network BTW) is 25 years old.
S >The typical offshore bank customer spends $1,000's on legal fees to
S >obtain information on reputable banks, the legality of what they are
S >doing in both the local and offshore jurisdictions, and to set up
S >obscure, sophisticated legal entities.  There aren't any good
S >statistics, but I'd guess that most of the money saved by going
S >offshore is lost to legal fees and fraud.
Sounds like market failure to me .  I guess that when First Wisconsin Oshkosh opened *its* Cayman subsidiary, it was taking unwarranted risks with its customers money.  I guess the people that put together all those film financing deals via the Netherlands Antilles must be kind of credulous since they are going to lose their dough.
Trusts and corporations are not "obscure legal entities" BTW.
S >A good on-line bank will tackle user friendliness by providing rapid,
S >detailed feedback, S >Trust could be more directly tackled by the following:
S >* Private deposit insurance, with risk spread across several
S >offshore banks Already in place in some jurisdictions.
S >* Offshore bank rating service, also available online
Loads of those now but not online. S >* Sponsorship by major banks, with a longer-term reputation
S >and larger capital base
Already the most common way of doing business offshore.
The main reason that Americans haven't opened foreign accounts is distance, transaction costs, and the costs of information.  The nets eliminate distance and cut costs of transaction and information.

INFORMATION HIGHWAY CROSSES THE SEA    The Information Highway arrives at ... 14 Caribbean islands.
    Cable   & Wireless (West Indies), AT&T and France Telecom announced a deal last week to build a fiber-optic network across the seabed. Scheduled to be commissioned in early 1995, it will run 1,100 miles from the British Virgin Islands in the north to Trinidad in the south. The cost will be about $60 million. It will be the largest system in the world that employs no "repeaters," units that sit on the ocean bottom and amplify the signal every so often. If ones goes bad, you've got to raise the whole cable and fix it.
    The cable will have capacity for at least 30,000 simultaneous phone calls, or the equivalent in data, video, you name it. Many islands in the region are trying to upgrade their telecom systems to attract service jobs. Notice that the clerk answering that toll-free vacation reservations number has a Jamaican accent?

suspensions for a host of offenses."  But cutting people off from "benefits"
just gives them the incentive to *work* for a living and they come out of it
stronger than ever with no ties to the government.  Until you deploy killer
robots to snuff deviates you can't make inroads into deviance purely by the
application of force.  The Commies tried.  Slick Willie only has the balls
to snuff a few Branch Davidians and Retail Pharmaceutical Salesmen.  "Wet
Work" is expensive.  Our prisons are likewise.
In New York City these days the big crusade is against unlicensed drivers
running over kids.  (Apparently, New Yorkers prefer their families to be
decimated by *licensed* drivers.)  The State automatically issues
suspensions and people keep driving.  The record is several hundred suspensions.
Note if you look around that even though there are more control attempts by
the State, things are less and less under control.  Compliance is *not*
increasing.    Because direct application of force is difficult and expensive, it is rare.
What Control Freaks need is *voluntary* obedience.  But that is based on
respect for powerful institutions (which is falling).  We are primates and
try to get along with our "tribe."  In the past our "tribe" was village,
then local area, then nation state.  Today, technology has broken things up
so that we can form many different sorts of "tribes."  If we obey the mores
of our "tribe" it is increasingly unlikely that that "tribe will correspond
to the geographical nation state.
I obey the mores of my *tribe* -- libertarian net dwellers.  Others are
members of other "tribes."  We will collectively tend not to obey our nation
states and their power will therefore decline.
It is perfectly possible to have a rich full life even though you disobey
your nation state.  You need not even be an outcast any longer.  There are
*other* communities in which you can find full acceptance and support
*without* having to move.

This can't be required because corporations and other legal entities can own
cars and these entities can, in turn, be owned by non-resident foreigners.
Funny story.  A couple of weeks ago, I rented a car from (a major car rental
agency) in a NE state.  They gave it to me for a week.  It had Florida
plates.  The registration expired at the end of June, three days into my
week-long rental.  I drove an "unregistered" car with the permission (albeit
unknowing) of a major corporation for 4 days. Also hard to break the Clean Team/Dirty Team technique where one family
member owns the cars and the others drive.  Same with property ownership.
If demand develops, I expect that some enterprising members of the
"underclass" will be able to rent their identities or rights to conduct
transactions to those who need them.  Government penalties won't faze them. It is *much* easier to protect your assets from a private party than from
the government.  Private parties usually can't afford to sue you in the Cook
Islands to try and break your Foreign Asset Protection Trust.  Tim, I sense that you suffer from the great American Insurance Addiction.
The belief that it is possible to eliminate all risk if you pay massive
amounts of money to an insurance company.  This tends not to work.  It leads
to mandatory insurance laws that lead to exploding insurance costs that lead
to system collapse.  Judgment proofing oneself is cheaper.
If you fail to include your SS# on your tax form but it is otherwise
complete and they have their dough, they don't prosecute.  Remember "Have
Spacesuit, Will Travel" in which our hero's father kept his money in several
cookie jars including one labeled "Uncle Sam" and then once a year emptied
that one out and sent it to the government:
IRS Agent:  But you have to fill out a tax form
Taxpayer:   The government can't even require that you be able to read and
In 1993, the IRS referred approximately 350 cases to the Justice Department
for criminal prosecution.  Out of 20 million tax evaders that's a pretty
blunt sword.
Note that the current ID requirements under the 1986 Immigration Act have
had the sole effect of *dropping* the price of an SS Card and a California
Driver's License on the streets of East LA from circa $50 to circa $20 (due
to economies of scale presumably).  More technically advanced ID will merely
encourage people to become self employed (a good thing in any case).
Germany has much tighter ID requirements than we do.  Illegals there work
through contract employment firms that accept the risk for profit.
On the subject of border controls.  The DDR tried machine guns, barbed wire,
and concrete as border controls.  It worked for less than 30 years and "that
was then this is now."  Things move faster these days.  Even with
anti-foreigner hysteria, Germany, France, and the Benelux countries recently
eliminated crossing controls.  The others in the EU "inner 9" should follow
soon.  NAFTA should reduce ours as well.  Note BTW that Mexican vehicles
(including trucks) will get ease of entry in a couple of years.  Good place
to register your car?
As more countries become "developed" and world real income doubles and
doubles again (with shorter doubling times) travel for all purposes will
explode.  It will make current travel rates (the highest in history) look
insignificant.  Swamping is bound to occur.
Since we've established that direct application of force will have to be
increasingly rare (cost factors) that leaves control freaks with only denial
of service to fall back on.  Since DOS leaves unfilled demands (if the
service denied is something people actually want) it will create its own
market opportunity.  Markets have become *much* more efficient at this sort
of arbitrage these days.  Note that those denied credit cards because of bad
credit suddenly have dozens of secured credit cards to choose from.  Tim has claimed that the government will get markets to reject willing
customers who have money to spend because they lack their 'US Card'.  That
runs counter to the entire history of markets.  People will find a way to
buy what they want.  DOS attacks will just leave people increasingly outside
the government system where some of us want to see them in any case.

As regular readers will be aware, Tim May and I have been sparring with each
other about the risks of various control strategies that the world's
governments may deploy.
I thought it might be helpful to make one of his fears concrete so that we
can analyze it.  I trust that I am not putting words in Tim's mouth.
The major concern is the same one mentioned in the Book of Revelations:
"REV 13:16  And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
REV 13:17  And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."
So the Feds deploy a card (smart or dumb) that has to be used for most
transactions and lets them track everything we do.  Tourists are brought
into the system through the use of temporary cards (or the machine-readable
strip on their passports which already includes a space for a national ID
How is this most likely to come about?  I consider force majeure to be
unlikely.  It would be rough to get Congress to impose a burden like this on
businesses (who would have to completely wire themselves) in a formal vote.
It is not necessary to do this in any case since they know they can't snag
everyone into the system.  They just want to capture most of the transaction
data.  If they can do it administratively without involving Congress in
controversy, they will use that approach.
Clipper and the Post Office agitprop on the US Card give us a possible
scenario.  The P.O., desperate to find a reason to exist as its core
business drains away to the wires and private carriers, would like to become
the primary digital signature authorizers for the U.S.  It claims to be able
to put millions of "US Cards" in the hands of happy shoppers within months
of the go-ahead.  (Assuming they use FedEx for the actual *shipments* of
course).  The recently attempted "Clipper maneuver" of game strategy
(government preemption by standard setting rather than by direct application
of force) shows us how the US Card system might be actually deployed.  The
government adopts the standard it likes and tries to make it the de facto
standard by requiring it for most official business.  An instant market is
thereby created.  No congressional action required.  Similarly, the government might try to preempt the market for digital
signature and commercial encryption technology by deciding to make anyone
who wants to use a digital signature system in dealings with the government
use the Post Office or some such agency as the signature authenticator.
Thus bids, purchasing, benefits, and taxes could all require your "US Card"
registered at your local post office.  The government would then hope that
commercial users who would need to use the government's system for tax
filings anyway would also use it for its ordinary dealings with the public.
Then if a health care bill drafting you into a "universal coverage" army is
ever passed, the "US Card" also becomes the Health Security Card you will
have to show to get a job in the US.
Thus, all sorts of authentication transactions would pass through the
powerful and efficient post office data network and the
ex-countercultural/born-again control freaks Inside the Beltway could get
their jollies tracking your employment and purchases.
What's the big hole in this frightening scenario?  Ask yourself one
question.  Why is the Post Office looking around for some useful work these
days?  Didn't they have a monopoly guaranteed by the Federal Government for
more than 100 years?  If they couldn't make a go of it with a pure coercive
monopoly during a time of slower commercial activity, what makes them think
that they can compete *without* a genuine coercive monopoly in a time of
constant change.
Governments have proved over and over again that they can go broke running
"guaranteed" money spinners like state lotteries and such.  They don't stand
a chance in a marketplace that will break the hearts of the brightest people
this planet has ever produced.
What has recent history established?  Governments are weaker.  Why didn't the Amin mandate Clipper?  No political ability to do so.  Why
are banks and telecoms being deregulated in nearly every country on earth
(in spite of propaganda about "risks" and "public needs"?  Why have exchange
controls (a common feature of life a generation ago) become impossible
almost everywhere on earth?  Is it "free market ideology" that has triumphed
or did the *reality* of markets rather than the *idea* of markets hit
governments on the head.
To those who romanticize the power of the State in the modern world I ask,
why doesn't Clinton impose wage and price controls, exchange controls,
tariffs, and a full-blown industrial policy?  Why doesn't he nationalize the
steel industry, guarantee jobs for all, confiscate all estates above
$100,000, impose 95% income taxes on those making more than $40,000/year,
and all of the other proposals that were popular earlier in this century?  I
doubt that he is restrained because of his deep commitment to human liberty.
He doesn't do it because he can't.  Markets wouldn't put up with it.  His
government would be destroyed (by capital flight.)  In this connection, I invite everyone to read the excellent profile of Japan
in last week's Economist.  It discusses the current and growing Japanese
commitment to deregulation and what is driving it.  That issue is a keeper
anyway because of an article on commerce on the Internet and (as has been
mentioned before) the use of the word "anarcho-capitalism" in an article
comparing Thailand and Singapore.
Assuming that the government were to attempt to establish a Post Office
mediated digital authentication system, there is no guarantee that it would
work.  Foreign users would presumably use foreign systems to authenticate
their transactions.  Some of these systems might be run by privatized
foreign PTTs or by others.  Note that since banks and credit agencies will
still have to approve the transactions anyway (to make sure you've got the
dough), they may decide to use other systems for signature authentication.
It would not really cost them any more.  Since information is cheap, setting
up a system to use several authentication systems is almost as easy as
setting up a system to use one.  (Particularly since you have to do it
anyway.)  It is difficult to imagine the P.O. being able to compete in the
cutthroat world of credit processing.
Recall that even today, there are companies that pick up and deliver your
mail to the P.O. to speed the process along.  Similarly, expediters may
interpose themselves between the customer and the P.O. to speed
authentication in the even that the P.O. network is slow or inefficient
(likely).  Here again, Clipper gives us some hints as to how the attempted market
cornering might work out in practice:  The Admin is currently floating
stories about perhaps withdrawing Clipper in favor of "wider discussions"
with the industry.  Clipper is already painfully obsolete and it isn't even
shipping in quantity.
Inefficient government monopolies create marvelous profit opportunities for
markets to arbitrage the gap between cost and price.  In a highly efficient
networked world, it will be very difficult for governments to compete.

Tim, you have the *easiest* situation not the hardest.  The hardest
situation is a high-income professional in a licensed profession who has to
work and can't really move.  Since you are in the "great army of the

converted to cash.  You might lose on your real property (depending on when
you bought) but that has always been the downside of property.

Only solid factual info & techniques to follow...
Marc Rich was born in Belgium and currently holds Spanish citizenship.  He
is free to travel anywhere but the US and has $0.5 Billion in compensation.
I doubt that he misses New York.  It is possible to "internationalize" your
family and friends.  I did it.  It is even easier these days because of
cheap travel and telecoms.  It is unfortunate that the US (and the
Phillipines) claim to tax a national's earnings anywhere on earth but there
you have it.
I'm not really speaking to Tim in these pieces (I'm sure that he can take
care of himself) but to others.  It is quite common for otherwise
sophisticated Americans to avoid thinking about expatriation even though
objectively it may be their best financial move.  I was recently working
with a businessman who has been self-employed and successful since he was a
teenager.  A libertarian, he was heavily involved in Foreign Asset
Protection Trusts (FOAPTs).  But even this guy was jumpy about expatriation
of self and money until he really checked things out.  Americans are too
However 60% of expatriate Americans don't file.  A high rate of non-compliance.
The fact that attempts at social control via political correctness dissolve
if you merely refuse to accept them shows a general method of political
resistance.  The technique applies in many situations.  Many control
attempts fail if you do no more than oppose them.  I know it sounds banal
but why don't more people do it?  I read constant pissing and moaning on the
Nets about the big bad government and I see few people trying to demonstrate
a little optimism.  There are so many show stoppers out there that are
guaranteed to get most control freaks to leave you alone:
"My father doesn't believe in sending us to your schools.  He says they are
controlled by communists." -- My daughter used this one.
"I am morally opposed to recycling." -- A real jaw dropper.
"But I'm not a resident of this state." -- Saved a guy I know a $400 fine
and automatic license suspension.
"Where's your warrant." -- Surprising how few people employ this one.
"All this agitprop about spousal abuse is merely an attempt to destroy the
bourgeois family so that it can be replaced by individuals and weak entities
that are dependent upon and hence supportive of the coercive state
apparatus." -- They *really* leave you alone after this one.
I know that I am given to rhetoric.  My wife complains about it all the
time.  But words are things too.  They are code.  I do recall that in "Snow
Crash" our heroine employed Jesuit Rhetorical programming to protect herself
against a Sumerian brain virus.  There are "magic words" that will help in
most situations.
I do have quite a few actual techniques (residential ambiguity,
contract/self employment, expatriation both real and virtual, avoidance of
database links or key fields, conventional tax planning, multiplication of
entities, clean team/dirty team, etc.).  I must have talked about all of
these on the list from time to time.

The nicest thing about electronic money is not that anonymous digital cash is possible. but that the money is electronic.  This means cheap transaction costs.  This means that even if "banks" deploy ID-based rather than anonymous transaction systems, civilians can quickly step in and offer to broker anonymous transactions for those who prefer their privacy. Just as you can cash checks for other people today, you will be able to carry out transactions for others on the nets.  Since it is much easier to operate these kinds of services in an electronic payment system with automation and on-line verification, suppliers should appear if the demand warrants.  Since people will be in different physical locations and legal jurisdictions proof of wrong doing will be hard to come by.

Another reason was the tax consequences.  If you were a US bank with money to lend and you lent it from the US, you owed taxes on the earnings.  If you formed a Netherlands Antilles subsidiary and lent money the earnings on those loans could be accumulated tax free "forever."  If the parent bank in the US could use some of this dough, no need to repatriate it, just lend it to the parent -- then the tax-deductible interest payments flow from the high-tax parent to the zero-tax subsidiary getting more money forever out of the hands of the tax man.
The next time you go to the cinema, read *all* the credits.  Chances are you will see a line towards the end like:  "Financing provided by SomeBank, NV" indicating a Netherlands Antilles corporation.

Ever since the Trust was invented in England under common law, entities have been created and become "human" actors.  (On my "some day" list is an article on Trusts - The First Software Agents.)  Likewise corporations.
What good does it do to control (some) meat people if each person can spawn a hundred agents (often outside the jurisdiction) which can perfectly legally act on their behalf.  I know it will be possible to force these agents to be linked to humans but that would only be at birth.  No control is possible over who has the codes to control the software agents of the future.  Additionally, all government controls on software agents are dependent upon businesses willingly turning away (unregistered) willing customers.  Hard to enforce on the nets.

Even though your friend is no longer a U.S. Citizen he is a "legal resident of the U.S." in that he could not be deported.  Residence is defined at law as equal to "domicile" and is under the legal control of the individual rather than the State.  "Domicile" is defined as "Actual physical presence plus intent to make the place one's home."  Once domicile is gained, it persists even if you are away until one acquires a new domicile by one's own action.
So he could use the MIT version of PGP.  When their lawyers came up with their spastic language about users having to be U.S. Citizens or Green Card holders they weren't trying to be exhaustive.  They were clearly trying to mirror the ITAR crypto regs.  Since your friend, while not a citizen, is not an alien he can possess crypto technology under ITAR and thus under the MIT license.

A PUSH FOR SURVEILLANCE SOFTWARE
By John Markoff
In the age of computer communications and digital telephone calls, the
American people must be willing to give up a degree of personal privacy
in exchange for safety and security, the head of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation said.
In an interview on Friday, Louis J. Freeh, the F.B.I. Director, defended
proposed legislation that critics say would turn the nation's telephone
network into a vast surveillance system.  He said taxpayers would be
asked to pay up to half a billion dollars to develop and deploy the
necessary network software.
The Administration wants to impose new technology that would enable law-
enforcement agents to gather a wealth of personal information by monitoring citizens' calling patterns and credit card transactions over the telephone network --- and over the two-way cable television networks being planned by cable and phone companies.  The system would go well beyond the current wiretapping technology, because much of the information could be gleaned without the police or F.B.I. actually having to eavesdrop on specific voice or electronic-mail conversations.
"The costs are high, but you have to do a cost-benefit analysis," said
Mr. Freeh, who insisted that fighting terrorists and criminals was the
Government's intention --- not playing Big Brother to the citizenry.
`A Credible Solution'
"The damage to the World Trade tower and the economic interests of the
country are conservatively estimated at $5 billion," he said, citing
last year's bombing of the World Trade Center in Manhattan.  "I think
the American people will agree that this is a credible solution to the
problem we face."
The Administration is trying to line up Congressional support for the
legislation, called the Digital Telephony and Communications Privacy
Improvement Act of 1994, before having it formally introduced.
Government officials say traditional wiretapping is becoming increasingly
more difficult because more and more phone calls and data communications
are transmitted as streams of digital information --- representing the
ones and zeros understood by computers.  Thousands of such calls may
intermingle on a public-network circuit at any moment.  Proponents of
the legislation say new software placed on computerized network switching
equipment is necessary to help law enforcement sort through this traffic.
But executives of McCaw Cellular Communications, the nation's biggest
cellular telephone company, told Mr. Freeh and White House officials at
a meeting on Thursday that their newest telephone switches already provide
the surveillance capabilities requested in the legislation.
Moreover, privacy advocates say the Government can point to no case in
which digital network technology alone has impeded an investigation.  And
they note that in the World Trade Center case, it was not electronic
communications but mundane bungling of vehicle and warehouse rentals that
led to arrests.
An Electronic Portrait
Such critics have long warned that in the information age, it is possible
to build a detailed model of an individual's behavior, political and sexual preferences, social network and travel itineraries simply by examining telephone-calling patterns and credit card purchases.
Some capabilities were demonstrated when law-enforcement agents pieced
together a chronological list of phone calls made by the people accused
of plotting and carrying out the attack in January on the figure skater
Nancy Kerrigan.  But the type of software the Clinton Administration wants
to add to the public communications network would make possible much more
detailed records of individuals' electronic activities.
"It will be possible to develop a life-size portrait about you as a
person," said Jerry Berman, executive director of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, a Washington privacy-rights lobbying group.  "This is not just
about a phone number."
For the Administration, having taxpayers rather than communications
companies pay for the system is meant to dilute industry criticism of the
plan, which has met resistance since it was disclosed a few weeks ago.
Congressional support is difficult to gauge.
"The bill has some significant problems we need to resolve," said
Representative Don Edwards, Democrat of California and chairman of the
House Judiciary subcommittee on civil rights.  "The profiling and the
tracking aspect of the bill is something we are concerned abut."
A version of the legislation was first proposed in 1991 by the Bush
Administration at the urging of the Justice Department.  But unlike that
version, the new bill would limit the surveillance to public networks and
not include company phone systems --- private branch exchanges, or PBXs
--- or private corporate computer networks.
Despite those changes, civil liberties groups and some industry executives
say they are concerned that the scope of the new bill would give law-
enforcement agencies new access to a vast amount of "transactional," or
billing, information related to the setup of a telephone call.
Under current law, obtaining a subpoena to obtain transaction data from
the telephone company is easier than getting a wiretap warrant to
eavesdrop on actual conversations, which requires a judge to find
probable cause that a crime has taken place.
Mr. Freeh met with telephone industry executives at the White House on
Thursday and with Congressional leaders on Capitol Hill on Friday in an
effort to attract support for the bill.  He said in the interview that
he was willing to compromise by adding safeguards for transactional
"I understand the privacy concern," he said.  "My real objective is to
get access to the content of telephone calls.  With respect to the
extraordinary amount of personal information that is generated by this
new technology, we would consider some way to block some of that
information or raise the standard required to gain access.  We're flexible
on that."
The F.B.I. Director said new digital communications technologies were
making it more difficult for authorities to listen to conversations of
suspected criminals who may be using cellular telephones or whose
conversations may be carried as data streams in networks of fiber optic
Mr. Freeh said wiretapping had long been one of law enforcement's most
effective tools.  He cited examples in which it had been used effectively
to prevent crimes, including a case in Chicago in which a terrorist was
planning to shoot down an airliner with a Stinger missile.
In that instance, Mr. Freeh said, The telephone networks involved
were not advanced digital systems, but older analog networks that
send voices as electronic patterns mimicking natural sound waves. But he said there had already been hundreds of cases in which
attempted F.B.I. wiretaps had been thwarted by new digital
communications technology --- not, he said, because the suspected
criminals were necessarily trying to evade detection, but simply
because the public-network technology made it difficult for agents to
Last year, a group called the Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility obtained Government documents through a Freedom of
Information request indicating that an informal survey of F.B.I. offices
in Newark, Philadelphia and Las Vegas, Nev., found no instances in
recent years in which F.B.I. agents had encountered any technology-
based problems in conducting wiretaps.
Asked about those findings, Mr. Freeh said he was not aware of them.
Several telephone industry executives who met with Mr. Freeh at the
White House last week said that they were skeptical whether new legislation was needed and that they were concerned about provisions that would fine telephone companies up to $10,000 a day for failing to comply with the new law.
"This is just new faces giving the same pitch," said one telephone industry vice president who attended the meeting and who had been opposed to the Bush Administration's version of the legislation.  He spoke on condition of anonymity.
Executives at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company said they did
not believe there were significant technological problems that warranted
new legislation.  They also said they feared that the proposed legislation
would undercut the privacy expected by customers.
"Clearly the privacy concern is the biggest concern for A.T.&.T.," a
spokesman for the company, Herb Linnen, said.  He said the company would
continue to meet with the White House and Justice Department in an effort
to narrow the bill.  Industry executives and privacy advocates have also
warned about abuses of new surveillance technologies by telephone company
insiders and computer vandals.
But the F.B.I. Director said the protections in current analog telephone
systems would be adequate to deter most break-ins.
"This is always a threat," Mr. Freeh said.  "But it's de minimus if
you consider the alternative, which is not giving law-enforcement and
intelligence agencies these capabilities."
A White House official said that he believed opponents of the legislation
were overreacting and that the law was a good compromise between privacy
and law-enforcement needs.
"The authority to gather transactional information already exists; I
don't think this expands that authority," said John Podesta, the White
House staff secretary.  "We're open to talking through the issue with the
privacy community."

Letter to the Editor
THESE YANKEE CLIPPERS ...
Dorothy E. Denning asserts that the federal government needs to force
telecommunications consumers to buy into a so-called "weak encryption"
scheme using the National Security Agency's "Clipper" computer chip
because the government needs to be able to decrypt communications
traffic that criminals might generate in the future ["The Clipper Chip
Will Block Crime," Viewpoints, Feb. 22].  Denning fails to offer any
evidence that any criminal or terrorist group has ever used encryption
in the past, and also fails to explain why they would be stupid enough
to use a compromisable encryption scheme in the future.
Denning glosses over past governmental abuses of intercept technology
with assurance that Clipper intercept procedures are resistant to abuse.
Denning fails to mention that federal documents confirm that government
intercept procedures involving Clipper technology offer users no more
protection from wrongful government surveillance than plain text.
Intercepted data protected by so-called "strong" encryption cannot be
told from data protected by weak encryption until somebody actually tries
to break the code --- which would make random checking of the data stream
necessary to expose users of strong encryption schemes.  But the government disclaims the use of codebreaking except under court order.
Universal adoption of Clipper technology is unlikely because now, just
months after the government unveiled Clipper, designers are offering,
through electronic bulletin boards and user groups, freeware [available
for free tryouts before buying] programs using strong encryption.  It is
only a matter of months before true "military-strength" encryption
software reaches the market --- making Clipper the Edsel of cryptography.
If the government forces Americans to use nothing but Clipper encryption,
we can kiss the First and Fourth Amendment rights good-bye.  Hold out for
military-strength encryption to keep your data safe!

A late response to:
THE COMING POLICE STATE -- by Tim May
I don't think this centralization is likely.  Since all of the
future network plans call for the continued existence of private
networks (now exempt from the DTI proposal) and what we can call
"telephone" service (POTS), and since bandwidth will be so cheap,
and since the operators will continue to want revenue, anyone who
likes will be able to maintain a "private" network of any size. Any future digital version of POTS can be used to set up temporary
networks to link anyone to anyone (just a conference call). One can imagine that cheap bandwidth will make it possible (if
necessary) to set up networks that work (over fiber) like frequency
hopping and spread spectrum radio work today.  Since all fiber
networks are virtual anyway, how hard will it be to generate a
group of data streams that are meaningless unless they are combined
in exactly the right way and unreadable without key material even
if an opponent manages to combine them.  Stego possibilities here.
Except for operating systems developed in other countries and data
streams that pass through other countries.  Even if the OECD cuts a
deal there are hundreds of countries and the DTI is not supposed to
apply to private networks in any case.  Also note that the "new"
"improved" DTI calls for the Federales to *pay* for the DTI
hardware (and software?).  This was a sop to industry.  If they
aren't careful, they could end up paying for a lot of junk.  What
is the upper bound of all the hardware/software in the known
universe that is arguably included under DTI? "IBM will use its power to enforce standards..."  Not as easy as it
used to be.  Say, wasn't the (then) Bureau of Standards supposed to
release its updated replacement standard for DES in September, 1990
or something. Whatever happened to that deadline.  Standards change
so fast now and will change faster in the future that it is hard
enough for entrepreneurial firms to keep up.
That will be a rough one politically.  They drew back a bloody stump
the last time they floated DTI.  H.R. 6 on national teacher
certification standards disappeared under a wave of net-generated
attacks by home schoolers.
Has legal problems as well.  It took many years to get anti drug
legislation in place.  They don't have too many years available. How much enforcement activity can we expect.  Federal prosecutions
cost 50K+ each.  With absolutely no showing of damage (from casual
crypto "users") normal prosecutorial cost/benefit calculations
would suggest not much activity. Particularly since they have
gotten burned when taking us on (Steve Jackson Games).  This hasn't been tried since The Progressive and The Secret of the
Hydrogen Bomb.  No risk.  Likewise, no risk from speech codes.  The
federal courts have overturned all that are unconnected with
employment. Anyone have info on private network activity?
Did you see the Forbes article "Flight Capital" in the Feb 28th
issue?  It covers expatriation as the ultimate tax planning
device.  Note that if your life revolves around the Net, you can
expatriate yourself without even leaving "home."  Most of the
offshore locations currently have lousy network connections (except
Switzerland of course).  The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man
have ISDN.  The Caribbean is spotty.  Hong Kong is pretty good
(telecommunications wise).  Once you expatriate yourself, of
course, you can live in various European countries with good
telcoms as long as you don't spend too much time per year in each
one. Guilty as charged.  Think about it this way:
1)  Suppose no one uses encryption or remailers but just uses
whatever networks are in existence NII or whatever.  (Recall that
lack of funds will prevent the Federales from *paying* for the NII
- "He who doesn't pay the piper has a much harder time calling the
tune.") 2)  Americans and foreigners and everyone all equidistant from each
other. Cheap one-to-one, one-to-many, and the new category
many-to-many communications. Transaction costs (for info exchange)
dropping towards the limit of $0.  (The Economist estimates the
cost of supplying one transatlantic telephone call at 2
cents/minute with current technology.  AT&T charges me 59
cents/minute on the weekends to London.  Room for deep cuts.) 3)  Coase in the "Theory of the Firm" says that the only reason we
*have* firms is transaction costs.  With zero transaction costs it
would make more sense for us to buy each other's services on the
spot market.  As transaction costs fall towards the limit of $0,
average firm size will fall dramatically. 4)  As the number of firms explodes (aided by the cheap creation of entities/agents on the nets, the regulatory problem becomes
impossible.  Note -- I can create a trust with a one page
document.  The situs of that trust can be anywhere in any Common
Law jurisdiction.  It need not be registered.  Yet that trust has
almost all the rights of a human being.  It can buy, sell, own,
enter into contracts, sue and be sued, etc.  So can most of the
other sorts of "legal persons" created over the years.  It is
possible that in the very near future there will be more "legal
persons" than there are actual persons on earth. 5)  Because of cheap communications and information technology,
markets have become very fast moving.  Not just the market for
financial derivatives but even the markets for women's underwear or
for toothpaste.  Government attempts to control these new markets
are like attempting to capture the wind in a bag. 6)  Future markets linked by "free" comms and consisting of billions
(yes billions!) of individual (uni=cellular) firms/entities/actors
will sweep over regulatory barriers (that in any case apply only in
some nations) as if they are not there.  Think of Steve McQueen and
"The Blob" from the late '50s.  "The Blob" is the market. Try and
hold it back.  It's not in one place either where you can freeze it
with fire extinguishers, it is all over the earth. As to the Security State controls.  They can't even control
drive-bys in Brownsville, how can they control billions of
individual people and their trillions (quadrillions) of
Even if they get loads of information about us (and foreigners, and
artificial entities) they can only use a little bit of this data. They can only carry out a very few investigations and a very few
prosecutions.  Nothing compared to the size of Market Earth.
An expensive, rigid, inefficient hierarchy just won't be able to
compete.  Markets are fed by willing customers/workers who go
out of their way to give them money and labor.  The government has
to collect tribute from people who will go out of their way to
minimize the amount of money/labor given up.  This constrains the
growth curve of coercive entities. We ain't peasants bound to the soil any more.

Bearer bonds are not illegal in the US.  The interest paid on bearer bonds
issued after a certain date is not deductible from taxes but the bonds are
legal.  Additionally, depending on specifics, financial institutions may
have to report sales and purchases including tax ID # on some transactions
involving bonds.
A bond is just a debt obligation.  If you want proof that bearer
instruments are legal, endorse a check made payable to you - you have just
converted it into a bearer instrument (as long as you add no restrictions
to your endorsment).  You will not be busted if the government finds out
you signed the back of a check.

H>A few days ago I said I'd look up the legal requirements on promissory There are two separate issues in your post -- a promissory note and a negotiable instrument.
A promissory note is simply a promise to pay someone else something of value.  In order to be valid, the note has to contain enough information so that a court (or arbitrator) can determine that the maker of the note intended to create a debt, that we can determine the amount, and that we can determine to whom it is owed and when it is due.
A negotiable instrument is a debt instrument that can be sold (negotiated) and if sold to a "holder in due course" (someone who buys the note for value and without knowledge of any disputes) can be collected on its face terms and without reference to any counter claims between the original maker and the original creditor.
This aspect of negotiable instrument law has caused some libertarians to oppose the concept of negotiability.

Clipper Chip Is Your Fried, NSA Contends
NSA Seeks to Dispel Misgivings of Public About Clipper Chip
By Bob Davis
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal.
FORT MEADE, Md. --- The National Security Agency wants everyone to know
that its new computer-security system will protect individual privacy.
But as the spy agency knows, hardly anyone believes that.
Critics fear the government will use the NSA technology, designed in
secret, to spy on Americans.  The project "is a focal point for the
distrust of government," acknowledges Clinton Brooks, the NSA scientist
who led the so-called Clipper Chip project, in the agency's first
interview on the subject.
The Clinton administration last month adopted the NSA plan for a series
of computer chips that would protect telephones and computers.  Use
of the technology would be voluntary.  Federal agencies would adopt it
first, and public use is expected to spread gradually.
Under the plan, cryptographic "keys" that could unscramble the
communications would be split in two and held separately at the Treasury
Department and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  That
way, law-enforcement agents could tap the communications by getting court
authorization to obtain the two halves.  The idea is to boost security
but to keep the technology out of the hands of criminals and spies.
The NSA is the world's biggest eaves-dropper.  Equipped with the latest
in super-computers and satellite receivers, it targets communications by
foreign governments.  The agency shuns publicity but agreed to the
interview to explain its role in the Clipper controversy and try to
dispel fears.  Mr. Brooks, a 26-year veteran of the NSA, says the project
began in 1989 and cost more than $2.5 million.
He says the NSA is consumed with what it calls the "equities problem" ---
how to balance privacy rights against the needs of law enforcement,
national security and private industry.  In 1989, he and Raymond Kammer,
deputy director of NIST, began discussions about how to improve computer
security without making it impenetrable to police.  NIST is a Commerce
Department agency with formal responsibility for unclassified computer
Before the interview, Mr. Brooks takes a look around a small cryptographic
museum just outside the NSA's gates.  He stands before an exhibit of
Enigma machines, used by the Germans during World War II to encrypt
messages --- and later broken by Allied intelligence.  Enigma started as
a commercial product; recognizing its military value, the Nazis pulled
it off the market.  "That was the concern we're wrestling with today,"
Mr. Brooks says --- commercial encryption technology becoming so good that
U.S. spy agencies can't crack it.
In 1989, NIST and the NSA put together an eight-person team, split evenly
between the agencies, to quietly work out security concepts.  The team
decided against using a weak encryption code --- "Roman Numeral One is
that it had to be good security," says Mr. Brooks.  And it also rejected
a so-called trapdoor approach, in which the computer code would be
designed so it would have a weak spot --- a trapdoor --- that federal
agencies could enter via computer to tap the communications.  Someone else
could discover the trapdoor, they decided.
The team settled on a system with a powerful encryption formula, called
an algorithm, and encryption keys that would be held by outsiders.  Law-
enforcement agencies could get copes of the keys when they needed to bug
the conversations.  The toughest decision, both Mr. Brooks and Mr. Kammer
say, was to keep the algorithm, dubbed the Skipjack, secret.  That meant
the public wouldn't know for sure whether the NSA had inserted a trapdoor
or some other eavesdropping device.
"It would defeat the purpose [of the project] if we gave the knowledge
of how the algorithm worked" to the public, says the 56-year-old Mr.
Brooks.  "It was going to have to be kept classified."  Otherwise, he
explains, engineers could use the algorithm to design computer-security
systems that the government's encryption keys couldn't unlock.
By 1990, he says, as many as 30 NSA "cryptomathematicians" and other
employees were working to perfect the algorithm and other features.  A
year later, the NSA launched what it called the Capstone Project to build
the algorithm into a computer chip.  The NSA contracted with Mykotronx
Inc., a small company in Torrance, Calif., to do much of the development.
By September 1992, the NSA was confident the system would work.
None too early for the NSA.  Earlier that year, Mr. Brooks says, American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. informed the NSA that it wanted to sell a
phone using a popular encryption technology to scramble conversations.
The NSA balked.  "We said it probably wouldn't get an export license
from this country," Mr. Brooks says.  Instead, AT&T was told of the
Capstone work and agreed to use the technology if it became a federal
standard and was exportable, he says.  The NSA then took some of the
functions of the Capstone chip and tailored it to phone equipment, calling
the resulting product the Clipper Chip.  For computers, Capstone was
encased on a computer card that became known as Tessera.
The the Bush administration, enmeshed in a re-election bid, never pushed
Capstone.  So shortly after the election, National-security heavyweights
importuned the Clinton transition team to move quickly on Capstone.  Just
weeks after the inauguration, the new administration's national-security
team was debating the NSA proposal and in April announced to the public
that it would adopt the scheme.
Last month, the administration gave the final go-ahead --- despite
withering criticism from industry.  Vice President Gore called encryption
a "law and order issue."  NIST's Mr. Kammer says the new administration
was also trying to line up backing among national-security officials to
liberalize export controls on computer equipment and other high-tech
The high-tech industry was stunned at the decision.  David Peyton, vice
president of the Information Technology Association of America, a trade
group of computer companies, says the scheme will dangerously centralize
power in the federal government and will limit exports.  James Bidzos,
president of a computer-security firm, RSA Data Security Inc., goes
further.  He posted a letter on the Internet computer network arguing
that Clipper may be the "visible portion of a large-scale covert
operation on U.S. soil by NSA."
Nonsense, responds Mr. Brooks, who says he is distressed by the
"emotionalism" of the arguments.  "The only reason we're involved is
that we have the best cryptomathematicians in the country."

Something overlooked in the real world that encourages the maintenance of
private payment systems (cash) is th existence of a large number of people
with bad credit.
About 20% of the US population has neither credit cards nor checking
accounts.  Some of this is because of personal preference but a lot of it
is because these people can't handle something as abstract as a checking
account without wrecking it.  They *need* cash which will enable them to
use the simple budget process of adjusting to declining balances.
Thus, we see the recently introduced computer phonecards which you can use
to buy long distance phone service in advance for cash.  No hassles with
telephone account which tend to require a fixed address in any case.
Note also the popularity of secured credit cards which are now issued by a
score of financial institutions.
There will continue to be a big market for "cash" to serve this market.

So all those aliens who want to legally receive "munitions" within the US can form a US "corporation, business association, partnership, society, trust, or any other entity organization or group including governmental entities" and have that institution which would legally be a "US person" receive the "munitions."
In fact, I think that the multiplication of entities can be a useful tool.  Transfering your car or your assault rifles to corporations formed in convenient jurisdictions can be a good way to dodge regulations that apply to "persons" within a particular jurisdiction.  Note that under the current assault weapons control legislation you are supposed to record the sale of your weapons over time.  If they are owned by a corporation, they need never be transfered.  The corporation can be transferred instead.

The article suggested that unless people turn to the State for protection
from "anarchy" the State will fade.
Here is my argument (recycled from a few years ago) as to why State power is
I expect that State authority will continue to weaken over the next few
years for the following reasons:
1)      The ruled outnumber the rulers.
2)      The ruled outmass the rulers.
3)      Traditionally, the rulers used a number of techniques to maintain         their rule:
        a)      Ideology of acquiescence and consent - The will of God,                 tradition, the will of the people, 'you can't fight City                 Hall,' Death and Taxes, The Government is All of Us, etc.
        b)      The application of superior mobility and organization -                 we are everywhere, omniscience, omnipresence, etc.
        c)      Point force.  A mass of armed men in the field.  'Reduce                 the city.  Leave no stone standing upon stone and sow                 the ground with salt.'              4)      The effectiveness of the above require an ignorant, docile,         immobile, and uncritical population:
        a)      Respect for authority is on a rapid downward trend.                  Disobedience is widespread.  One-third to one-half of                 the housing units in Nassau and Suffolk counties are                 illegal "in-law" apartments.  Seventy-five percent of                 those hiring domestic workers in the US do not comply                 with tax and employment laws.  Hundreds of thousands of                 assault rifle owners in New Jersey and California have                 not turned in their guns.  I see no examples of any                 increase in respect for state authority.
        b)      The mobility and organization of bureaucratic                 organizations is now less than the average private                 organization.  Nation states are still geographically                 bound, we are not.  The individual or small group has                 always had better organization than the State - he/it                 has just had less power.             c)      Point force only works against concentrated opponents.                  It is useless against mass movements of goods nd people                 like the market unless a totalitarian clampdown is                 used.  If movement continues, State power is lost.
5.      Freedom is not only an ideology, it is also what you get when         people make relatively unconstrained choices.  Even the most         broken slave makes choices.  When a modern, technologically         advanced, mobile people makes choices, they can overwhelm control
        mechanisms.  All they have to do is *choose*.  They need not be
        ideologically committed libertarians.
6.      Is there immigration control if millions of immigrants are on         the march (here *and* in Europe)?  Is there gun control if the         number of guns possessed by the population (here *and* in Europe)         continues to increase.  If the amount of the world's wealth that         is legally or illegally outside of the tax system increases, is         taxation succeeding?
7.      Predictions.  Per capita gun ownership will continue to increase         in all of the OECD countries as it has for years.  Legal and         illegal immigrants as a percentage of total population will         continue to grow.  The percentage of the Gross World Product         that does not flow through the coffers of the world's States
        will continue to grow as it has for the last ten years.
8.      Unless the above trend lines reverse and the "coercive sector"         regains some moral authority freedom of choice will continue to         grow.  For example, if gun ownership per capita continues to         grow, at some point everyone who wants a gun will have one.  No         gun control.         9.      Controlling people is difficult.  It has all of the normal         problems of hydrology with the added complication that in this         case the "water" is intelligent.  Controlling smart, rich, well-

I suppose I shouldn't admit this as a privacy advocate but I wonder why
anyone is interested in all this health/credit data.  Since they can't *do*
anything with it in the real world, seems like a waste of time.
Especially the health data.  Suppose "they" find out something about your
health status and "they" deny you insurance.  Under the system "they" have
constructed, you just show up and get "health care" anyway -- whether at the
local hospital or in Toronto or London.  The only "advantage" that "they" get from finding out about your health
status and denying you insurance is that you no longer have to pay them any
money.  You still get the same level of care.
If you are a bright person with a big mouth, you can get them to spend as
much dough on you -- sans insurance -- as they would on a normal schlubb
*with insurance*.  That's the way "they" set up the system.
It may not even be too illibertarian  of you to play the system like that
since they have used force to prevent you from buying your care on an open

a good (personal) credit history, what is the point of all these conflicts

help individuals on the margin, neither personal privacy nor personal

You mean mass executions of "corporate officers" for example if the 'peepul'
felt like it.  Last time I looked there were millions of employers (not a
small number) and the average size of companies was declining.
You seem to think that the power of corporations -- which consists in the
cases cited merely of refusing to hire or deal with certain people -- is the
same as the power of a "democratically appointed" armed force.  This armed
force is to bash down doors to force these evil corporations into an
association with people they would rather not associate with.  In other
words non-violent "refusal to deal" by corporations is *evil* while armed
breaches of the peace by law enforcement (including shooting resisters) is
*good*.  Not a very "humanistic" perspective.
Note too that anti-discrimination laws also punish small powerless entities
(individuals) who discriminate not just massive corporations.  And what law
protects those who the "peepul/government" don't like from discrimination.
As a member of a hated minority (crypto anarchists) I'd rather take my
chances on an open market than risk official discrimination by the state. Mercifully, the technology we are developing will allow everyone who cares
to to decline to participate in this coercive allocation of power.

In a valiant attempt to link the libertarian political debates of recent
days to the stated purpose of this list...
The future social environment will offer more than adequate challenges for
everyone; but libertarians should have an easier time of it than the
surviving advocates of "social justice." People -- bless their little hearts -- are different.  If you give each
person a pile of cash as high as their eye and more than 1,000,000,000
things to spend it on, they will go out in as many directions as there are
people.  Students of human individuation (see "Free & Unequal" by Roger J.
Williams) have discovered the obvious fact known to all mothers that babies
are different even before birth and they continue to get more different as
they develop into adults.
Computers (the first consumer product produced by nanotechnology), the Nets
and the modern business environment, are collectively involved in a
full-scale test of the above premise.  In spite of complaints from the
"Generation of Whiners,"  the current expansion of wealth and choice will be
surpassed by the (very near) future explosion of wealth and choice.
People with money, information, opportunity, and choice are *going* to
choose.  They are not going to let themselves get pushed around by others.
Oh sure, for a while old habits may restrain them from directly challenging
traditional mechanisms of control but if they have the money and the choices
of things to do with it they won't be held down long.
This change will occur is because "the young" and "outsiders" (foreigners)
will ignore traditional restraints (since they haven't internalized them)
and explore the full range of choices available to them.
If you take an animal out of a cage, it may observe the non-existent bars
for a while and pace back and forth but it will eventually discover that it
is free.  And most of us are smarter than animals.  The only hope for control freaks to continue to control us is to restrain
our range of choices.  They can't count on mere words or traditions to bind
us.  But the range of choices continues to go up.
Trade is way up.  Wealth is way up.  International travel is way up.
Migration is way up.  Resource prices are the lowest in human history.
Communications costs are way down.  Electronics costs are way down.  We are
in a zero or negative inflation environment.  The quantity and quality of
goods and services offered on the markets is at an all-time high.  The
percentage of the world's countries headed by dictators is the lowest it's
ever been.
What all this means is that political philosophies that depend on force of
arms to push people into line,  will increasingly fail to work.  Rich people
with choices will, when  coerced, tend to change their investments and
business affairs into a friendlier form or to move to a friendlier
environment.  Choice is real.  If choices exist, they will be made.  An ever
higher proportion of the world's people will be "rich" in wealth and choice
as the years go on.
Only a political philosophy that depends on the uncoerced cooperation of
very  different people has a chance of functioning in  the future.
I, obviously, have an idea as to what that philosophy is.

Cypherpunks is becoming "horrors" libernet.
The only legitimate hook for this issue is the fact that many would oppose
crypto anarchy (if they knew it existed) because it makes things like
anti-discrimination laws possible.
To avoid too much damage to the list, I will try and restrain myself to two
observations on the subject of laws against racial discrimination (which
libertarians do oppose):
1)  Laws are enforced by threat of (or by actual) violence.  Supporters of
outlawing racial discrimination are in the position of arguing that
non-violent social disagreements (the decision by someone not to deal with
someone else on *bad* grounds) should be "solved" by sending armed men out
to punish the person deciding to refuse to hire -- say -- whites.  And of
course to kill him  if he resists his punishment.  I would rather see deadly
force limited to situations in which there has at least been a breach of the
peace of some kind.    2)  I have never met a person (and don't believe that there ever has been a
person) who has not discriminated on all of the "prohibited" bases
frequently.  Has there ever been anyone who selected -- say -- their friends
and lovers *purely* using random selection.  Never discriminating on the
basis of race, creed, color, sex, age, alienage, previous condition of
servitude, marital status, sexual or affectional preference, handicap, etc.
It would be hard to imagine someone who didn't use these prohibited
classifications in their personal sexual lives.
I observe little use of RNGs (see -- a cypherpunks technical reference after
all) in social intercourse.
Since it is legal (and indeed considered OK) to discriminate on all these
grounds in our personal lives, libertarians believe that discrimination
should at least be legal.  Freedom of Choice in *everything*.

That's not clearly true.  The totalitarian states we know of developed years
ago in a much less fluid environment.
A few years ago, there was a UK TV drama about a contemporary Labour Party
Prime Minister.  In the course of the show, the new PM announced that he
would immediately impose exchange controls to "keep money in Britain."
(This was written before the real Labour Party officially eschewed exchange
controls in a furtue Labour government.)  The joke is that two weeks before
the election of a Labour PM, all the loose investment funds would have left
the UK anyway.  Nothing left to block.
I think that a *new* totalitarian state would have a hell of a time
borrowing money and all of the existing states are cash poor.  They need to
borrow.  They don't want to be distracted by rioting pensioners.  Even the
secret police don't work for free.  Currency devaluation would hurt as well.
After all, there can't be a totalitarian state that doesn't massively change
(introduce uncertainly into) the conduct of life and business in its country
(and if it is large, in the world).  Markets have a way of dealing with
uncertainty.  Capital flight (seeking safer investments) and high interest
rates (to compensate for risk).

these people happen to know how many people cross US borders each year?
Would you believe 40,000,000!  It seems unlikely that we can go from 40
million to zero without some problems.  This is travel in both directions of
course.  Most of the crossings are of the US-Canada and US-Mexico borders.

"Nobody wants to do his case because he is believed to carry a weapon and be
dangerous." -- Deportation agent speaking of a felon they deported so that
the New York Times could watch.  This was a guy they picked up at his
employer whose name they got from his INS file. He was shipped off to
Nicaragua and promised to be back in a week.  Each Deportation Officer has
4,000 cases assigned and is allowed to deport about one alien a month.  You
do the math.
Note that the DDR was better than most countries at sealing its border but
it still failed.  It is no longer with us. The fgailure of border sealing shows the general inability of modern
governments to cope with there enforcement problems.  1984 is no where in sight.

But the AZ D of R can't use a profile to actually *find* your money or,
indeed, to determine that you are a resident of Arizona.
I *love* it when the government decides to use automation to cut people off
from permissions/benefits if they don't "toe the line."  Since I would like
them to cut *everyone* off from permissions/benefits, every step closer to
that situation is an improvement.
Apparently, "Seaquest, DSV" had a little automated punishment example on
yesterday's show.  A guy on a motorbike was speeding and his plates were
scanned on the fly and he was notified, while still driving, that his
"Social Security Account" had been docked for some $700 in fines.
Note that all they accomplish by such things is to convert people into
"outlaws."  If government benefits and permissions are withdrawn from you
then the incentive for you to play their game is reduced.  Automated
punishment also weakens the hold of the government even on those who obey
the law because they knwo that they can lose their government "benefits" at
any time and so they value them less.
In a strictly practical sense, such punishments encourage those punished to
learn how to live outside the government's reward/punishment system.
Note the non-compliance rates in New York City for driver's license,
insurance, and registration rules.  The DMV computers automatically suspend
someone's license (even if he's never had one) and he keeps driving anyway.
People accumulate hundreds of suspensions.

But we designed and deployed the remailers not as part of a criminal
enterprise but in an attempt to *generally* protect privacy.  We may also
have wanted to weaken some of the control measures inherent in the TCP/IP
protocols.  The TCP/IP protocols are *not* a government.  It is legal to weaken them.
Additionally, federal courts have explicitly held that anonymous
communications (and anonymous associations) are protected by the First
Amendment.  No US Attorney is going to be interested in the sort of messy political case
that would be involved in remailer prosecutions.
What we are doing in any case is more like sedition than a normal criminal
conspiracy.  The Feds have only brought two sedition cases in this century
(WWII isolationists and white supremicists in the 1980s) and didn't do too
well.  Sedition cases are real hard to win because in order to prove intent
to overthrow the government you have to prove some realistic capabilities.

It's easier to make an omlette out of eggs than to make eggs out of an

This differs from the popular view that decryption would eventually win the
"war" with the encryption and devise a way of defeating *any* possible
code/cipher.  This "fact" was expressed in Edgar Rice Burroughs' Mars
stories where he said that the Martians didn't use codes much because they
were vulnerable.  See also Sneakers in which we have a "black box" decyption
device that can break any code.  Also the guy who confronted me at the

This depends on location.  The Feds require that banks use the same ID to
open an account that they would require to cash a check.  The banks on the
Left and Right Coasts are fairly restrictive (more restrictive than they
have to be).  Banks in the Heartland (particularly the Intermountain West)
are much easier.
With a little work, it is still possible to open accounts with "soft" ID in
the more relaxed regions.  Since these banks are accessible by ATM and Fedex
and will soon be on the net (in some cases), they can be convenient to use.
Likewise Canadian banks (which routinely offer US$ accounts).  In the soft
ID category, I place Employment ID and Student ID which you are free to make
yourselves as well as the new secured credit cards; some of which can be
obtained in spite of one's lack of existence.  The latter make very good ID.
This will be the most interesting story of the next few years.  I will be
anxious to see if the new ease of "switching" money reverses the trend
toward decreased financial privacy caused by the war on money laundering.

They really worry that you will divert real checks payable to the account name you are using, deposit them, collect the dough, and disappear.  They will then be on the hook because they paid on a false endorsement and the institution that deals with the false endorser gets stuck.
They are also under an obligation to obtain identity information from everyone who opens accounts (even non-interest-bearing).  Many Midwest banks still don't.  The rules don't specify exact ID requirements so there is some slop here.  They say you have to use the same ID requirements to open an account that you (the bank) would use to cash a If you shop around, you can find friendly banks even today.

I don't know, I find it pretty easy.  All you have to do is say "The

so what's a few cigarettes?"  I thought Heillary said that children had a

the above, it has to allow them to smoke and avoid vaccinations as well.  If
it's wrong to interfere with kids' autonomy in sex and litigation, than it's
wrong to interfere with their autonomy in guns and smokes.

@_subject: Phone Card Risks 
One of the plethora of TV Magazine shows featured Tim McViegh and phone
cards last week.  Maybe I should post to Risks.
According to the story, Tim McViegh bought a bunch of phone cards from "The
Spotlight" (famous Klan paper) which carried the Spotlight brand name.  He
made lots of calls.  Later, the Fibbies who checked all the phone records for room and pay phones
at the motels where TM was staying came up with lots of calls to the 800
number of the vendor who was actually switching calls for the Spotlight
phone cards.  The vendor found the card number(s) that matched those calls
and all the other calls that matched those card numbers.  They made it seem like such a match was a big thing.  Perhaps their
transaction database was not well developed.  In any case, they wrote a
little software and gave the Fibbies a list of all of TM's calls.
There are supposed to be lots of calls to fertilizer dealers, his sister,
and others.  Very interesting.
This is an obvious risk in the use of phone cards that anyone should be able
to figure out for themselves since it is the same risk that pay phones have
always had.  If the Fibbies can find out what telephones you have used, they
can get those records and trace things from there.  This problem has
occurred before for "right wing" nuts and the Mafia.  Several years ago
after members of The Order robbed an armored car in northern California, the
Fibbies found a nearby motel where a bunch of suspicious characters had all
stayed together and traced calls from the pay phone outside to various
wives/girl friends and broke the case from there.  Likewise Mafiosi in their
NYC social clubs have often shown bad phone habits using the nearest pay
phone, etc.  If a pay phone is used enough and well-enough known to the
Fibbies, it even becomes worthwhile to tap it.
So buy lots of phone cards from different dealers (*never* The Spotlight),
use phones unconnected to you, don't make too many calls from the same phone
or using the same card, and be sure to destroy the card preferably before
you use it (the only significant thing about phone cards are the numbers
which can be stored in an encrypted file).  An easy way to accomplish much of the above is to hang out in big cities
instead of the boonies.  It's a lot easier to find an unlinked phone
(unlinked to you, that is) in the city than in the country.

@_subject: Predicament Again 
Just because I love beating a dead horse...
Back in June we had the argument over whether or not Phil Z should be
worried because of the threat of prosecution hanging over him.  And a
prosecutor (?) by the name of Brian Davis as well as Tim and others thought
that I was wrong to say that I would enjoy the process because of the
opportunities for verbal abuse and point scoring that I would have were I
under threat of prosecution in a case the government couldn't win.  (Mostly
pure 1st Amendment cases.)
The reason that this is important is a big fat tactical fact.  Defeat is a
process that takes place in the mind of the enemy.  It is well known to
military types that it is possible for the weaker force to overcome the
stronger force if the stronger force can be convinced that it has lost.
People are rapidly becoming the stronger force in conflicts with governments
because of technology, but governments are trying to use intimidation where
they lack the capabilities.  They are trying to psych us (and particularly
the more credulous) out.
We can fight this weapon by constant hammering at the fact of the
government's weakness and its failure to intimidate us.
Since most of what we do on the nets is speech and since speech enjoys a
great deal of protection in the US, it is important to hit the opposition
hard in speech cases where we have a strong hand.  I certainly don't
advocate abuse of prosecutors in other cases (taxes and drugs) where
conviction is likely.  But in pure speech cases, we should really heap on
the derision.  I happen to think that the prosecution of the award-winning
Phil Zimmermann is one of those kinds of cases.
Another similar case surfaced in Connecticut.  The "Greenwich 5" had
conspired so that nonsense syllables in their high school yearbook photo
captions spelled out "Kill all the [African Americans]."  (Note the
cypherpunk significance of code use.)  There was a bit of controversy of
course and the young scholars volunteered to attend a "Civil Rights Boot
Camp" run by the now neo-conservative CORE.  Some weeks later, local and
state prosecutors announced that they would not prosecute the 5 under CT's
civil rights laws because of "lack of evidence."  Calls to The Butcher of
Waco for federal prosecution followed but have as yet had no results.
This is the sort of case in which I would advocate that the "object of
prosecutorial interest" be as aggressive and abusive as possible.  The
reason the prosecutors declined to prosecute was not lack of evidence but
lack of law violation.  The prosecutors were too cowardly to state that the
Greenwich 5's action was perfectly legal.  Since the public servants won't,
it is up to those who are attacked to do so.
The benefits of cutting through the exon in a case like this is that
prosecutors are less likely to proceed in similar cases in the future and
the public is educated as to the true state of the law.  It is recreational
as well.

The two "errors" in the sentence are:
1) The use of the future tense.  There are a host of encryption products
available today that are very strong.  Unless you were talking about ease of
use.  Newt Gingrich -- in a similar statement -- was speaking generally
rather than about children and that's where I noticed the error before.  It
is a present not a future capability.
2)  And no government on earth will find easy to decipher is an
understatement.  As I'm sure you know, properly deployed modern cryptography
(or even the 100-year-old technology of one-time-pads) is mathematically
infeasible to break.  Though of course attacks other decryption remain possible.
Both of these are really quibbles rather than substantial criticisms.

under the terms of the account.  A bank is responsible for payments made on
a forged drawer's signature and anyone who accepts an instrument from a
forged endorser eats the loss.  But online clearing with digital signatures
makes it hard to forge the drawer's signature and digital cash doesn't have
the sort of endorsement system used on paper checks.

But who's going to ask?  If an anonymous payment system springs up outside
the US, we can use it as a store of value if nothing else or for shopping
overseas. Domestically, we can convert non-anonymous payment systems into
semi-anonymous ones.  What counts is difficulty of transaction and market
demand not legal structure.  Thus, about five minutes after the "temporary
VISA card" travelers check substitutes are issued, I can start selling them
for (discounted) cash to all comers.  Likewise Ecash laundry servers letting
anonymous people use non-anonymous Ecash.
It remains to be seen how much customers value anonymity.  There should be a
niche market in any case.

@_subject: e-mail forwarding, for-pay remailers 
I have found that credit cards are very good ID (even though they aren't ID
at all) since people are sure that you can't get one without getting
thoroughly checked out.  A secured credit card in a nome de guerre backed up
with employment photo "ID" will usually get you what you want.
The reason that market access controls like these break down is that they
are dependent on every seller on earth giving up the profit involved in
selling to you.  Sellers are different.  You can usually find one who
doesn't check ID well or is in another jurisdiction (in the case of non
physical transactions).  A new effect is the spread of libertarian (small L) political ideologies
which means that a growing group of market participants are philosophically
opposed to traditional control regimes.  Eg C2.ORG.
A final problem for control freaks is that Friction Free Capitalism is
eating away at the traditional market institutions that have grown up during
the control era.  Thus if traditional banking, telephony, and electricity
distribution are wiped out by new forms of competitive business activity it
is hard for regulatory agencies to extend their traditional controls to the
new entities.  Budget restraints play a part as does inertia.  All of this
is before the new market players deploy anti control technologies and
procedures.  They are in business because they can displace traditional
quasi-monopoly institutions and often see government as just another
competitor to be bypassed.

Unless you open a bank account in a nome de guerre.  In the Inter-mountain

student ID.  Since anyone can be an employer or a school, anyone can issue
such soft ID.
These items work very well if backed up with a secured VISA card from one of
the many issuers.  Some of the issuers of secure credit cards want
references but many will issue their cards if your name comes up as having
no credit record.  Made up people are the most likely to have no credit history.
Even though a VISA card is not meant to be ID, most people (even state DMV
offices) treat it as ID.

Since the Supremes have always supported anonymous speech, it seems unlikely
that anonymity could be outlawed.  Things like mandatory identification for
net access (hard to enforce worldwide) would also seem to be a "government

[Banner Headlines]
BRITISH BOY `RAIDED US DEFENCE SECRETS'
by Tim Kelsey
A 16-year-old Briton allegedly hacked into some of the US government's most
sensitive computers and was able to watch secret communications between US
agents in north Korea during the crisis over nuclear inspection last spring.
After reading them, he put them onto a bulletin board of the Internet, an
international computer network accessible by 35 million users.
_The_Independent_ has learnt that Scotland Yard has arrested the boy and has
sent a report to the Crown Prosecution Service.  Officers expect to be told
whether he can be charged this month.
In what US officials have conceded is one of the most serious breaches of
computer security in recent years, the boy accessed several defence
department systems for at least seven months without detection.  The systems
he obtained access to included those for ballistic weapons research, and
aircraft design, payroll, procurement, personnel records and electronic mail.
The boy, who was arrested in Tottenham, north London in July, was, according
to US officials, one of a number of people who broke into US defence
computers in the latter months of 1993 and the early months of 1994.  But it
is understood that he was responsible for most of the damage.  In all, more
than a million user passwords were compromised.  The US Defence Information
Systems Agency admitted in a private briefing, which has been confirmed,
that the hackers had affected the Department's "military readiness."
The boy was first detected in March 1994, and the Air Force Office of
Special Investigations (OSI) was appointed to investigate.  The OSI is a
special task force, based at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington DC.  It
mounts special "raids" on classified computer sites to test their security.
A spokesman said yesterday that the boy, who was nicknamed "Datastream" by
friends on the Internet, needed "more knowledge than the average home
computer owner would possess" to hack the computers.  It is understood that
he invented a "sniffer" programme which searched across hundreds of
computers attached to the Internet for passwords and user names.  He was
finally caught because he left his terminal on-line to a US defence computer
over night.
Another British hacker, aged 22, who is acquainted with "Datastream", read
some of the messages accessed by him.  "They contained information about
firing sites in North Korea and stuff like that.  Field intelligence.  He
kept detailed logs of communication traffic.  He really couldn't believe his
luck.  The Americans thought he was a spy but he told them he was just doing
it for fun.
The OSI said in a statement:  "It is unknown if any hacker actually read,
copied or took any other action with the Korean files or any other sensitive
data.  The Korean files were on the Girths Air Force Base computer system
and therefore the could have been accessed.  It is our opinion that the
hacker who accessed the Korean file system learned of its existence form a
bulletin board system or another hacker.  It is possible the hacker could
have read the Korean files."
Scotland Yard's Computer Crime Unit is able to prosecute the boy under the
terms of the Computer Misuse Act, which allows for crimes committed overseas
by Britons to be dealt with in UK courts.  A spokesman confirmed that a
report had been sent to the CPS.
The Internet, designed in the 1960s by US Defence engineers to enable them
to communicate quickly by computer, is now available to anyone who pays a
small fee.

fuzzying up any focus on your "cluster of transactions."  Thus it is trivial
to use multiple names and addresses for multiple transactions.  Particularly
if you "go bare" in the insurance arena, many tracking opportunities are
denied your opponents.  This will also save you big bucks in premiums
foregone.  You also have to watch the stuff most people don't think about
like magazine subscriptions which can easily be had in any name (and should be).
The current possibility of getting multiple secured credit cards in multiple
names will become even more fun as the temporary Visa and Mastercards
(travelers's checks on a card) are issued.  Plenty of entrepreneurs will be
buying and selling those.  Just like the phone card market today.
They will no doubt try but closed systems have a hard time competing with
open systems. A good way to track the future control possibilities is to
track how easy it is to get an internet account.  If it remains as easy to
get an internet account in the future as it does today, then it will be very
hard to indulge in central transaction controls. I am predicting that there
will be a convergence between the ease of communicating over the nets
(institutional ease not interface ease) and the ease of completing
transactions.  I think the convergence will be one sided in the direction of
easier and easier transactions.  Again, I'm not talking about technical ease
here but the structural or institutional ease of completing transactions.
"Frictionless Capitalism" is frictionless across the board.
The belief that it is possible to "press down upon the brow of labor this
Crown of Thorns, to crucify mankind upon a Cross of Red Tape" (to mangle a
phrase) is worthy of ridicule.  I happened to catch "Funeral in Berlin"
today.  The Commies didn't manage it with a lot more going for them than

Securities and Exchange Commission doesn't stand a chance.  I thought the guy was in Zamboanga (where the monkeys have no tails).  At
least that's what he told me in his email.  The gardener was an independent
contractor.  The babysitter worked for a temp agency (at least that's what
she said).  I know I paid a company.  At least the digicash went to
something with a company name.
Not sure if that's true.  Are there fewer illegal aliens, fewer people
driving without licenses, fewer people practicing medicine without a

It has changed substantially.  Once "born classified" and subject to prison
sentences during WWII, possession and use of crypto is now "legal as church
on a Sunday."  The government's position as late as 1978 (later in the case
of Admiral Bobby) was that open publication of cryptographic research was
good for a free trip to Leavenworth to make little ones out of big ones.
[The fact that they threatened a lot more than they actually prosecuted
doesn't mean that this wasn't their position.]  Things have changed.
It is easy to imagine such a thing since that is exactly what cops do now
when they encounter people committing acts which used to be felonies.  They
ignore them.  It is quite possible for social arrangements to change in such
a way that the sovereign is no longer held to be able to compel testimony or
the surrender of information.  Certainly, technological changes can make
cases where the cops are aware that you provably possess information rare.
There were no nation states or cops prior to 1600.  It is perfectly possible
that there will be no nation states or cops at some point in the future.
Since policing is a labor intensive occupation and as currently organized
suffers from socialist inefficiency, it may well be disintermediated.  Thus,
cryptographic protocols can (if desired) practically exclude the possibility
of theft (of digital goods).  And if the bulk of the world's economy
consists of digital goods/services (measured by value not volume or weight
obviously ) then computers and crypto may be enough.  Nanotechnology may make self defense more efficient than "others" defense
and may make it so easy to defend against state power that it brings on the
collapse of the nation state.  Technological changes bring social changes.  Full nanotechnology may not even be necessary.  A computer is a nanomachine.
The capabilities of these toys and the networks they run on may be enough in
and of themselves to weaken monopoly institutions of coercion beyond their
tipping points.

The bodies are still needed for management, analysis, arrest, prosecution,
and punishment.  Until Robocop is deployed, the criminal justice system will
be a labor intensive effort.  This is still good news for us though.  Anyone
who's been in business (say George McGovern after his Connecticut inn
bankruptcy) can tell you that people are the most expensive part of a
business.  You pay all that cash each year and at the end of the year you
have nothing concrete to show for it.  You are just buying time.  Labor
costs become more of a problem as the quantity and value of capital goods
increases since the more slowly increasing factor (labor) is bid up.  Thus
people cost a lot more these days than they did in 1800 because capital
goods (per unit) are much cheaper than they used to be.
(Ignore temporary changes in returns to labor as women, 3rd world residents,
or freed commie slaves join the labor force.  They are quickly absorbed.
Wants are unlimited.)
Now the increasing cost of labor is not a problem if those workers are
producing goods of value.  They are "making" their own earnings.  If they
are in a parasitic profession, however, -- one that subsists on what it
steals from others -- the rising cost of labor means that that institution
has to steal more and more to keep up.  Eventually, the speed of economic
change can swamp the theft ability of such an organization.
Such swamping occurs because market entities support their own growth or
they don't grow.  Since they lift themselves up, growth is unlimited.
Parasitic entities on the other hand are limited by the strength and
susceptibility of their host.  Hosts may weaken if the parasite grows too
much or it may find a way to cast off the parasite.  No one rejects a market
economic actor that is a potential customer or employer but parasites are
rejected whenever possible.
Market Earth on the nets gives us many opportunities to both fuel fast
growth and shake off parasites.  It is perfectly possible for markets to
outbid the secret police for the labor of its agents given the compound
growth rates that are a feature of friction-free capitalism.

Assassins with Sly Stallone and Antonio Banderas with Julianne Moore as the cyberspatial interest.
This may be the film derived in part from some writer-type's conversation with our own Tim May.
Sly and Antonio get their contracts via computer from an anonymous source.  They favor Powerbooks.  The source types on the tops of the screens they type on the bottom.  The Powerbooks must have built in wireless modems because they are pretty casual about firing them up wherever they happen to be.
Julianne is cute.  Apparently being a net security expert/hacker is seen as women's work in Hollywood with Sandra in the Net and what's her name in Hackers.  Also this sort of life interferes with your social contacts because both Sandra and Julianne seem lonely.  Julianne likes cats.
The screens look fake (like most Hollywood computer screens).  There is minor mention of encryption.  Julianne is a "ghost" (self-described) with no SS# or DL.  She does have a car and apartment, however.  As always in these films, much of the action is motivated by a single high-density floppy.  It's amazing the amount of stuff they can get on those disks.
Most of these character's problems could be solved if they would simply transfer this info over the nets without having to meet in person.  They could also encrypt disks much more than they choose to.
Coincidentally, I saw both The Net and Hackers this weekend.  It is hard to decide which is the "best."  Assassins is slick and Antonio makes a great psycho.  [Note to Sly --- Many of your problems as a professional assassin could be solved by a few finishing shots to the head. --- I thought they taught that on the first day in assassin's school.]  I suppose I liked Assassins best although Puerto Rico makes a poor stand-in for an island tax haven.

I hear this from commies all the time but I don't have to take it from a fellow libertarian.  I expect commies to be economically illiterate.
The notion that the unskilled have nothing to sell is the same argument as saying that poor, third-world nations have nothing to sell (and should protect their markets via tariffs).  Commies these days (The End of Work - by anti technologist Rifkin) make the same claim.  This implies that wants are limited.
Most economists operate on the assumption that wants are unlimited.  Certainly I do.
In addition to becoming skilled, the unskilled can supply personal services that we as primates will still like to have suppled by people.  If "magically" supplied goods make goods cheap, labor becomes dearer by Some people seem to think that the theory of comparative advantage means that the person/nation with the lesser comparative advantage can't do anything.  What it really means is that the more efficient concentrate on those things they are more efficient at while the less efficient concentrate on less valued tasks which the more efficient could do better if it was worth it to do so but it's not.

Your leader entitled "The myth of the powerless state" (October 7th) made some valuable points about the continuing significance of state power in our lives but missed some very significant numbers.  You state that public spending in the "big economies" has expanded from 36% to 40% of GDP since 1980.  But, if you take the world's economy as a whole, can you doubt that the percentage of Gross World Product (GWP) controlled by the world's states has declined since 1980.
Note the following significant changes.  1)  In both developed and underdeveloped countries, the "informal sector" has continued to grow.  You, yourself have reported that the poorest households in America spend twice their official income.  2)  The Soviet Union has gone from an almost 100% government-controlled economy to one which has a much smaller state sector.  Meanwhile informal and formal privatization in China, India, Britain, etc. have transferred vast assets to private control.  3)  The continued accumulation of offshore funds are effectively outside of the game and under no flag.  The amount of these funds is hard to estimate but has surely grown quite large.
The convergence of all of these factors suggests that, at some point in the late '80s or early '90s, the percentage of the GWP controlled by governments peaked and began to decline.  As technology makes it easier for the financial services industry to carve its niches in the corridors of cyberspace, stateless financial assets seem sure to grow.  Since anyone can use powerful mathematics to create virtual spaces which even the largest government is powerless to enter, the percentage of GWP that the state even knows about much less controls will shrink.

I am also projecting a transition from physical to non-physical goods and services.  Thus most entertainment, financial services/investing, professional services, and indeed the rest of employment services will tend to be non-physical.  We see a lot of unbundling already in which services are split off from the more physical parts of a transaction.  Drop shipping, contracting out, etc. Say that it was 1750 and you were a French Physiocrat.  You might say that land and agriculture should be taxed because that represented the only important part of the economy and the nation's wealth.  The making of goods was insignificant.  You would have ignored what was to become a big part of the economy.  It is possible that the non-physical part of the economy will become much bigger than the physical.
Note that most money itself is non-physical.  And if the physical part of the economy is taxed and the non-physical isn't the market will be skewed in favor of non-taxed activities.  Also even though most people are geographically bound, if their consumption switches to non physical goods, they can acquire these goods anonymously or securely from any place on earth.

Thanks for responding, Black (if I may call you Black), it means I don't have to.  Also an incentive for jurisdictions to engage in a beneficial "Dutch Auction" in which they offer lower and lower tax rates to attract employers and employees.
And as the intellectual components of goods and services are increasingly unbundled from the physical for efficiency reasons (greater range of competitors made possible) more work can be done at a distance.  Fairly easy these days with drop shipping of goods by third parties and the bypassing of retail distribution chains for more and more goods.
In any case, if goods end up being a smaller portion of Gross World Product, taxes on them become less significant.  The existence of taxation of physical goods certainly tips things in favor of the untaxed non physical goods and services.
Note that agriculture once made up 95% or more of GWP.  It doesn't any more.  Non physical goods like entertainment, financial services, etc can grow to dominate the world economy because they adapt well to cheap distribution over the nets.

@_subject: Mark Twain Bank (was: Anonymity: A Modest Proposal) 
For those interested in the first bank to back Ecash:
Mark Twain Bank opened to serve the wealthy suburbs of Saint Louis (Ladue
and Town & Country) a few years ago.  It was meant to be a public "private
bank" for sophisticated customers.  A few years ago when the rules were eased, it started offering accounts and
CDs denominated in 25 foreign currencies.  These accounts were meant for
international investors and business types in the area.  They were
discovered by "hard money" newsletters and became popular with that crowd.
They have been the cheapest place to get foreign currency accounts in the
US.  Initially, the bank didn't realize that this sort of "hedge" market
existed but have since exploited it fairly well.
These accounts are FDIC insured up to $100,000.00 in $US equivalents.
Obviously, exchange losses are not covered by FDIC insurance.
The Ecash trial involves opening a World Currency Access Account which *is*
FDIC insured and using it to fund your Ecash account which is *not* insured.
They are treating the Ecash Mint part of their operations and the various
customer Ecash accounts as investment accounts (hence the investor
sophistication disclosure questions on the application form).  Unanswered questions --- What will the SEC say?
Mark Twain seems to be carrying on the fine old tradition of Saint Louis
banks being a bit independent and out in front of the crowd.  Other examples
include Southwest Bank always leading the nation on Prime Rate changes and
the Saint Louis Federal Reserve Bank (the only FRB to publish a hard money

Wednesday night's ABC magazine program on Ruby Ridge was a great example of
what TV can be but so rarely is.  Lots of chopper shots of Ruby Ridge.  Lots
of hand held camera recreations and interviews with the Weavers and the
sniper (face obscured because he has something to hide), etc.
But the most interesting thing that this emphasized for me was the sort of
modern information warfare issues as highlighted in the recent Economist
Survey.  Info war is war by other means (a little shooting, communications,
publicity, and litigation) and look what happened at Ruby Ridge.  The Feds
deployed 400 "troopies", some armored personnel carriers, copters, executive
jets, Hummers, and other hardware.  On the other side were 3 adults and 4
children with some 14 personal weapons.
The result.  One Fed and two Weavers dead.  A $3.1 million legal settlement,
and continuing problems for the Feds.  That smells like a bad defeat to me.
They couldn't even kill 7 people with a 57 to 1 force ratio.  In addition, the operation and the various investigations must have cost the
Feds millions more.  (What *do* the Fibbies have to pay for those Ninja

That suggests that the ability of The Great Enemy to overcome the sort of
directed human activity of the frictionless markets we are building will be
quite limited.

Dave.  Sorry you didn't catch the implied change of tone in the above.  I
meant to show a switch from Space Cadet rhetoric about the nets to a more
realistic view. These separate spaces won't wipe out the Real World (used with permission)
but they will influence it as a form of private property that is self
enforcing neither dependent on force for protection nor capable of being
penetrated by force.  This is a BIG THING.  You can't live in it yet but you
will certainly be able to trade digital goods and services there and stash
digital goods (work product, databases, etc.).
Having a place that is under your exclusive control has enormous practical
and psychological implications.  Think of the change that occurred when
peasants came to be able to own land.  Cyberspace contains spaces that can
be cheaply created, individually owned, and free of confiscation.  And since
the bulk of the wealth of OECD countries is non-physical (consisting of
various forms of ownership rights and "choses in action") that wealth can be
protected cryptographically.
Don't you like the idea of a "place" that's yours alone?  It's not dangerous
(to you).  It increases your choices.  Your power.

@_subject: Car rentals, Driver's Licenses, Ecash, & Net Access 
Lucky Green's reply to someone else motivated me to comment:
For the holiday weekend, I rented a car at a major agency in the state where
I usually sleep.  To secure the rental, I presented a driver's license from
another state and a secured VISA card.  The agency presented me with a car
bearing the license plates of a Southern state far away from the rental
location.  In the past, this agency (one of the majors BTW) had given me a
car registered in yet another Southern state for a week's rental bearing a
registration that expired halfway through that week.  No problems in any case.
Interestingly enough, the agency refuses to rent to local citizens of the
state where it is located and where I often sleep.  My posession of a
"foreign" DL makes it easier for me to rent cars.  Money and imagination
overcomes many of the "social control" aspects of licensing and registration
Now what this all has to do with transaction controls is the following.  It
is suggested that governments and private parties will cooperate in imposing
absolute restrictions on people's ability to complete "unlicensed"
transactions.  Thus it is suggested that driving, posession of a motor
vehicle, working for pay, having a bank account, having a phone account,
having a net account can all be rigidly controlled.
We've all read the stories about the DMV and how various states are pulling
licenses for child support arrears, tax evasion, overdue library books, etc.
The Feds have proposed a National SS# Database that would have to be
consulted before the 60 Million people who annually change jobs would be
allowed to do so.  And it is easy to imagine that additional restrictions
would soon be placed on job changes.  After all, we don't want deadbeat
dad-tax evading-library book hoarders working in this country, do we?
Likewise the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, et seq was supposed to end anonymous
bank accounts.  And a lot of the recent porn on the nets agitation has
involved attacks on anonymity.  Suggestions have been made for licensing net
access.  Finally, electronic check proposals are supposed to be traceable
because those who open accounts will be identified.
The readers of this list can apply what they already know about the
difficulty involved in restricting net access to the analysis of these other
existing and proposed restrictions.  The problem with the theory of
transaction blocking is that it requires millions of potential sellers of
goods, services, and jobs around the world to turn away customers.
Something that most people are unwilling to do.
Thus, if some entity tries to control net access by restricting it to
"licensed" users --- a real legal problem in the US BTW --- all that you
have to do is open an account somewhere else on earth and dial out to it or
use a connection via an X25 network.  All the Great Enemy can do is make you
spend a little more money.  Eventually of course, encrypted untraceable
TCP/IP sessions will be possible and domestic ISPs could -- without risk ---
offer "encrypted only" pipes out to the nets.  "Once you get there it's up
to you what you do but we don't/can't know about it."  Note that soon, millions of people will have high-speed, cable-based,
full-time net access.  These people will be one mouse click away from being
a full-service ISP.  Stick the ISP in a Box BSD CD-ROM in the drive and
double-click on setup.exe.  If the CD-ROM is produced by the right parties,
it will automatically support encrypted TCP/IP.  These millions of ISPs can
offer net-access accounts right away and add dial up later for the neighbors
if they feel like it. It is the vast number of vendors and the cheapness of the connection that
makes it so hard to control net access.  The computer and telecoms
revolution has the same effect on banking and other services to which the
authorities hope to block access.
Thus cheap telecoms, computing power, and well-developed electronic funds
transfer systems are easily turned into free banking.  We all know that
every node/user on the net is a potential gateway to another network
(potentially of great size) on the "other side" of his connection.  In the
same way, every user of "cheap, easy, and open" electronic funds transfer
system is a potential bank, a potential money "switch".  The famous Fort Lee
Switch located in Fort Lee, New Jersey at the West end of the George
Washington Bridge is an important switch for the financial funds transfer
networks going into and out of NYC.  Think of it as the IBM 360 running a
proprietary operating system on a somewhat closed loop.  The future open
funds transfer systems will be like the personal computers that can far
exceed the performance of the old monopoly mainframes.  Since everyone will be able to switch funds (and every *one* includes every
fictitious entity, software agent, corporation, trust, organization, or firm
anyone can create on earth) they will be able to switch funds for anyone
else.  Controlling a system with an almost unlimited number of switch points
will not prove possible.
Individuals and the entities they control can be counted on to protect
themselves from the financial losses occasioned by fraud or theft.  They can
be their own auditors.  But they can't be counted on to forego profit so
that the governments of the world can try and prevent some people from
engaging in mutually beneficial private transactions.
An attempted cartel of that sort --- one that tries to enlist the billion or
so people who will be easily and reliably switching funds within a few years
--- is doomed to failure.  Too many potential 'cheaters.'  Too much money to
be made by breaking with the cartel and offering financial services to
others who wish to use them.
And where money leads, other forms of human interaction will follow.  Once
money is free it can buy, bribe, or finagle it's way past the other
attempted restrictions on voluntary transactions.  "If you can figure out a way to keep 1 billion people who have cheap,
powerful, uncensored, computers and telecommunications from being free;
you're a better man than I am Gunga Din."

The government, as you no doubt know, sometimes operates under different
rules.  Thus when the "Red Squad" (Intelligence Division) of the New York
City Police (located in that big building on the North side of Vandam
between Greenwich and Houston BTW) was sued for maintaining files on "lawful
protest groups" they entered into a consent agreement to refrain from this
sort of thing.  Later, the courts said that this agreement meant that the
cops couldn't even listen to WLIB radio (NYC's favorite radical
African-American station) to find out in advance where rallies were going to be.
Since the White House is doing this reading of sites with public funds and
since that institution is the most powerful in the world --- it can nuke its
enemies, for example --- people are naturally interested to discover if they
are the subject of an investigation.
This is a demonstration of the unintended effect of electronic surveillance
technology.  The fact is that it can do more harm to the authorities than to
the public.  The Nixon Tapes/The Thompson Square Park Riot Video/The Rodney
King Video.  Since those in power are more interesting than ordinary people,
they represent a more "target-rich environment."  Information about their

The nets weaken these restrictions because they allow action at a distance.

He also mentioned Federal regulation of Indian reservations in this context.  What he wants to do is discourage state promotion of gambling.

[Note:  Whenever I do one of my longer pieces, it seems to drop into the
void.  Perhaps they are so well written and complete that no one can think
of any comment to make on them.  Perhaps not.  Read this one and comment.
You won't regret it.]
In honor of the Second Annual Conference on Information Warfare a few
weekends ago, here is my proposal towards a paper to be presented at next
year's conference.
                              The Mesh in the 'Hood
If any of you have not read every word of The Economist's Survey of Defence
Technology - "Softwar" in the June 10, 1995 issue --- shame on you.  Do so
In that report, there is the following description of the future battlefield
without platforms (ships, aircraft, armor).  AKA the Mesh.
The Mesh is a network imposed over a landscape (what used to be called a
battlefield).  The network of sensors, smart munitions, small attack
modules, and perhaps human troops, shares information and kills enemies
moving through it.  Friendly forces travel through it as if it weren't
there.  It is "flat."  Hills and valleys disappear and expensive platforms
[tanks, helicopters, etc.] have nowhere to hide since it is co-extensive
with the whole territory it covers.  It is also tough because it is hard to
destroy enough parts of it to make a difference.  Nuclear munitions might
destroy a Mesh or imposing a stronger Mesh over an existing one might work
if you didn't mind wholesale destruction but defeating it without massive
destruction is hard.
To quote from the Survey:
"The mesh has a number of advantages. It is hard to attack, because its
strength is spread widely. It is hard to damage, because there are so many
communication paths. Many small sensors can provide a better picture than a
few large ones. More sensors allow the information domain to conform more
closely to the physical terrain. At the moment line-of-sight detection by
sensors in a widespread network leaves topographical blind spots--wadis,
narrow valleys--in which platforms such as attack helicopters can lurk."
"While nets may see through the fog of war, meshes also tackle another of
the problems von Clausewitz identified; war's friction. The mesh is a
war machine with almost no moving parts, save the actual warheads of the
weapons. It is a solid-state device; its mechanisms have migrated far
into the spectral dimension of information, leaving only a thin skeleton
framework in the world of height, breadth and depth."
It certainly makes for a challenging war environment.  The Mesh is created
by warriors to effectively serve warriors' ends, I would like to suggest the
possibility that civilians might create their own Mesh to serve their ends.
A Mesh is Just a Net with Attitude
The Internet is (as we all know) a network of interconnected computers that
cooperate to exchange information in a standardized fashion.  Its purpose is
communication.  If its purpose is extended, it can become a Mesh.
Assume that the Net has grown in size and importance so that a significant
portion of the population in a given geographic area is fully wired ---
hardly a dramatic assumption.
All of those machines are cooperating to enable the various sorts of
communications that people want to use the Net for.  Some of those machines
are already connected to external cameras to do "silly" things like put
pictures of Stockholm on the WWW.
What if people connected other things to the Net?
While it is unlikely that most people will put a chain gun in the window and
interface it with the Net anytime soon, other useful connections are possible.  [And even in the case of weaponry, specific neighborhoods might be
interested in doing creative things now.  Thus Bo Grtiz' heavily armed,
Patriot, Recreational Subdivision in Idaho might find a use for the Mesh.
And won't those Black Helicopters be surprised.]   More peaceful civilians might deploy a Mesh to protect themselves against
bad people whether official or unofficial.  Like the existing Speedtrap website ( but in real time, cameras and passive
sensors could track the minions of the State as they cruise through
neighborhoods.  They could also multicast live, full color, and audio images
of arrests and less formal interactions with the authorities.  Fans of
Robert Heinlein will recall that Jubal Harshaw used a version of this
strategy in "Stranger in a Strange Land."  Cops behave better when they are
on camera (and know it.)  The Net allows everyone to play.   END OF PART I  (More next week).

@_subject: "Contempt" charges likely to increase 
Hence the proper approach which is to constantly demonstrate your contempt
for the court.  Daily (hourly) phone calls, faxes, email, physical letters
going on in boring detail all the reasons that you have for never purging
yourself of the contempt.  Logically, that should shorten your imprisonment
but in practice...
Obviously offshore key escrow facilities should have provisions similar to
those in Foreign Asset Protection Trusts (FAPS).  For example (from a recent
non-fiction work on FAPTs written by one of the greatest minds of his
Duress Provisions
The trust document should also contain language that basically says, "The
Trustees should not obey any instructions that anyone else gives them under
the orders of any court that has no jurisdiction over them."  You see, a foreign-based trust is not under the jurisdiction of a court in
any other country.  A court can only order people to do things if it has
them under its physical control.  For example, a German court cannot send
the police to Bermuda or to the Channel Islands to force your trust's
trustees to transfer trust assets to the court for payment to creditors.  What creditors in a German court will try to do in such cases is to find
someone in their jurisdiction who has some powers over the trust.  They then
order this person to direct the Trustees to cough up the trust assets.  A duress clause frees the Trustees from any obligation to obey instructions
caused by orders from a German court.  It is a powerful method of protecting
your trust from the asset grabbers.  But, you may ask, "What if a persistent creditor manages through some
miracle to get an order against the trustees from a court in the foreign
jurisdiction where the trust is located?  That's easy.  You include "flight
provisions" in your trust.  Flight Provisions
You know that German courts or those of any other country will have no
jurisdiction over your offshore trust assets.  But what do you do if a
really dedicated creditor tries to pursue your trust in the courts of the
trust's home jurisdiction.  Flight provisions take care of this situation.
These provisions will require that the location (situs) of either the trust
or the trust assets (or both) be changed automatically, in the event that
creditors move against your trust in its home location.  So even if they do
manage to get a court order against your trust, the trust will have been
moved to another jurisdiction.  Your creditors will have to start all over
It is important to realize that having a "flight" clause in your trust is no
guarantee that the trust will successfully escape.  The trust and its assets
must be moved in time.  It is possible that the trustees will fail to act in
time and your trust may be frozen in its foreign jurisdiction.  These
provisions do add an additional layer of protection, however.
If you do run into financial problems, you may move your trust in advance of
need -- before any lawsuits are filed.  You can also protect yourself
further if your investments are physically located in a third jurisdiction

Also, such a penalty will be pretty rare.  One doesn't stop driving because
one might be killed in a car accident.  The number of people who will be
jailed annually for contempt for "failure to decrypt" will always be small
and a rapidly declining percentage of total world transactions will lead to
such jailing (as transaction numbers double and redouble as more of the
world's people enter the Market and the Net).  Coercion is a dull tool
because people have an incentive to avoid it.  Reward is a sharp tool
because people seek it out.  One of the reasons markets beat governments.

The withholding tax applies only if the payee is not a resident of a

the waters on this because of the difficulty of telling the residency of

@_subject: Open Systems, Closed Systems, & Killer Apps 
At the Digital Commerce Society of Boston lunch last Tuesday, I had an
epiphany.  I finally got the answer to the great question of our age:  Why
do open systems beat closed systems?  One of the peculiar things about today
is how successful open systems have become.  Closed systems like Communism,
X.25, and IBM have fallen to markets, TCP/IP, and the personal computer
respectively.  And this has happened all over the world in institutions with
incredibly varied political and social systems.
We were discussing the Chinese government's proposal to maintain a monopoly
ISP in China that would censor the connections of its peons and as usual I
pointed out the many ways that such restrictions could be overcome (Don't
tell T. May about the draft defining a new MIME type "TCP/IP packet".  I
know he hates MIME).  Which led to the response "Sure a few techies will be
able to overcome the restrictions but the masses won't and the government
won't mind a little leakage as long as they maintain overall control."  To
which I retorted "ordinary people will overcome the technical barriers if
they have sufficient motivation."  Which brought up the subject of what are
the "killer apps" for the Net.  What will motivate people enough to choose
open communication even though it's hard and sometimes even dangerous.
Which led to:
The killer app of open systems is not any particular application it is the
openness, the freedom itself.
The denizens of the DDR had to overcome the Stasi, barbed wire, mines,
walls, tank traps, etc to adopt an open systems architecture.  Learning to
use a few TCP/IP tricks (or building them into applications and using those
applications) is much easier than breaching the Berlin Wall.
Open systems whether MarketEarth or TCP/IP let you trade/communicate at will
with anyone else.  This leads to more trade/communication which leads to
more wealth (or non-monetary satisfaction).  Since people are able to do
more things that they want to do (unblocked by hierarchies) it is only
natural that they are more satisfied with the results (and there are more
results to be satisfied with).  After all, a hierarchical system can only
produce outcomes directed by the hierarchy (in the best case).  But the top
of the hierarchy is much smaller than the bottom of the hierarchy so it can
only think of, deal with, and authorize a small number of activities.  So
the system can only do a few things.
I should have known this before since it is implicit in my favorite article
from the Economist "THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING COMPANY" 15 December 1990 "Part of the answer [as to why firms are shrinking] may lie in the fact
that, loth though they are to admit it, top people's capacity to deal with
information is limited. There is no technical reason why a Wall Street
investment house should not line the walls of the managing director's office
with screens, showing second-by-second price movements for thousands of
securities. But there is not much a single person could do with all that
information. So the best way to take advantage of increases in the amount of
information coming into the firm is to push decision-making down the
corporate hierarchy, to where the flow is manageable by a single mind: on
Wall Street, a trader."  [And if you don't, the market will.]
Hierarchies my be able to produce a lot of a limited range of products:
megatons of sandy concrete and dead bodies like Communism, or globe-spanning
private networks like X.25, or millions of pounds of Armonk Iron like IBM,
but they can't produce as broad or satisfactory or an output or in the end
as *large* an output as open systems can.   The Net or the Market can produce an incredible range of products that no
*one* would ever think of (save for the *one* who did).  And since people
are more likely to find things that they want in the whole range of
"products," open systems encourage more activity and hence more "wealth."
Additionally, the absence of the need to ask permission from Gosplan, or the
Sysadmin, or some marketing committee obviously makes it possible to do more
faster.  You not only save the begging and committee decision time, you can
do things that others might think bad or peculiar.  No need to convince
strangers about the value of your idea prior to trying it out.  You get to
just do it.
Now none of these differences between open systems and hierarchies meant
much when the bulk of the world's population had to spend all of its time
growing food to survive, but now...
Choice exists and choices will be made.  Hierarchies will try and resist the
spread of open systems but they will not be successful and their failures
will come faster and be much more obvious as time goes on.  If one
organization resists "successfully," people and money will drain away from
it to other organizations where they are allowed a fuller range of choice.
The success of open systems will help the spread of those systems into the
surviving bastions of hierarchy.  That's why I'm the Pangloss of Cypherpunks "everything's for the best in the
best of all possible worlds".    I know that this is all Kindergarten stuff but sometimes simple things are
hard to see.  People today are offered a choice between two ways of doing things:  1) You
get to do what you want and (by the way) have a vast wealth of "things" to
own/use. or 2) You have to do what other people tell you and (unfortunately)
make do with less of everything including choice, money, and "toys."
I wonder what choice people will make?

Or as I said in my letter to the Economist on their article "Censoring
You suggest that Internet Service Providers might be required to employ "stop lists" supplied by their national censors to block objectionable material.  The current focus is on banning smut.  But no doubt many nations will want to ban various political and religious views as well. Surely, you know that anyone with a direct (TCP/IP) connection to the Internet (all Windows95 owners, for example) is not dependent on service providers for anything beyond a physical connection.  Everyone who has such a local dial-in account is able to link to any site in the world at no additional cost.  No long distance phone calls are necessary.   A lot of people who know nothing of the nets think that they can be
controlled "like magzines and newspapers" in the words of a Bell Atlantic
exec.  Like the Bavarian prosector, they will learn.

Of course that doesn't overcome the "technical problem" of getting the IETF
to adopt that change in the protocols and getting a significant number of
sites to adopt the new protocol.  Even if you impose a substitutte on the
IETF, it doesn't stop them from wandering off and creating their independent
protocols and seeing whether the "official" or the "unofficial" get adopted.

Well this is as good a time and place as any to ask the question that
none of the opposition seems to have asked (perhaps because they don't
know enough to ask):  How do you force geographically dispersed nodes
on a distributed network to adopt a set of officially mandated protocols?
But first a reading assignment:  "How Anarchy Works--Inside the Internet
Engineering Task Force" from Wired.
So, now we know that the IETF has been pretty successful as a means
of standards setting.  We then have to go on to discuss how The Great
Enemy might undertake to intervene in this process.  1)  Are there any official agencies currently involved in drafting substitute protocols?
2) Do the public employees on the IETF behave any differently from the
private employees?
3)  Do the world's governments have the programming talent?
4)  Do the world's governments have a way to get users at all levels
to adopt their protocols?
I don't know the answer to these questions.
We know that governments would like to impose things like the Simple
Tax Transfer Protocol on the Net as well as Is A Person (and Is A Minor)
Protocols.  The Heathen Chinee have proposed their own entry into the
protocol design process as have many of the other governments.  Do
they have any idea yet how to go about it?  Do we?

Various correspondents have pointed out that X.25 is an "open system" in
that it is not proprietary.  I knew that.  I was thinking more of
hierarchical vs peer-to-peer.  I have been under the impression that
TCP/IP connections are more peer-to-peer between different sorts of
networks (or nodes) than X.25.  Isn't X.25 more of a standard for a
single network?  Don't X.25 networks need someone more "in charge" than
TCP/IP networks, or am I mixing up different layers on the OSI reference
model?  Which gives me an opportunity to post the only mnemonic that I

Why nothing.  Even your employer has done a bit of this protocol "forcing".
The actual question though is would a successor organization(s) do anything

Just to make it perfectly clear...
The US (and the Philippines) are the only countries in the *civilized world*
that tax non-resident citizens.  This means, par example, that if you are
born in the US and leave at the age of 2 days, never return, never get any
services from any US government, you are subject to full US federal
taxation.  If you happen to reside in a country with no tax treaty with the
US, you will owe local country taxes *plus* US federal taxes simply because
of citizenship.  In any of the European countries, you can eliminate your
tax liability for foreign (out-of-country) source income simply by moving
overseas.  They tax all residents but only non-resident citizens who have
domestic source income.  The US grabs everything even if you've had
virtually no US contacts.
This is why some rich Americans have renounced their citizenship to avoid
taxes on their non-US income, rich Brits don't have to renounce they can
keep their citizenship and just move.
Note the other areas this has applied as well.  Roosevelt's outlawry of
private posession of gold by Americans made it a crime for Americans to own
gold anywhere on earth.  And the proposed regs on licensing of space
launches prohibited Americans from committing unlicensed space launches
anywhere on earth.

That's not a threat.  It's a promise.
Cypherpunks have many different political and ethical views.  Like other
denizens of the Net, some tend towards libertarianism.  In fact, some of us
argued five years ago or more that the culture of the net was inherently
libertarian because making realistic threats of force was difficult over a
communications medium.  People just hang up on you.  Since the best way to
get on in electronic interactions is to offer something somebody wants and
use third party guarantor systems to assure the payment in cases where
payment is required, people would get used to non-coercive mechanisms of
exchange and this would shape their general attitudes.
Note that 95% of the world's population were once peasants bound to the
soil.  They had zero status.  They were born one place and were stuck there
until they died.  This was ordained by God.  When the age of reason and the
machine came along, the productivity and hence the value of peasants
exploded.  They were able to leave the land and work in factories.  Even
though they looked like they were worse off, the earliest factory workers
were vastly wealthier than they had been on the land.  The ancien regime was
destroyed by technology.  Since then, we have experienced the Century of Death during which national
states murdered more than 100 million people.  In 1995, the Government of
the United States collected under threat of force some $1.4 Trillion in
exactions.  More than any government in the history of Mankind.  Today's
regimes seem as natural to us as did the former arrangements which bound the
peasants in thrall.  They are ordained by God.
Once the peasants had an out, they flocked to the cities and they continue
to do so today in the Third world.  Some of us on cypherpunks merely predict
that when freed of the restraints imposed by the modern nation state,
today's "peasants" will do the same.  For the factory and the city
substitute cyberspace.
Social systems that are "ordained by God" are often discovered to actually
be sustained by secular power and when the balance of power shifts...

I'm following the Brain Tennis Match between Dorothy Denning and John
Gilmore on encryption and the right to absolute privacy on Hot Wired
Were I a participant in this exercise, I would lob the following to Dorothy:
I have to assume that Dorothy believes in absolute privacy (in some areas).
I am assuming, for example, that she does not believe in torture as an
interrogation technique.  I assume, therefore, that she believes in absolute
privacy in the individual brain.  While she may support imprisonment (or the
threat of imprisonment) as an interrogation technique (jailing for
contempt), I think she would oppose bringing out the hot pokers.
I have a wider point to make but please indulge me for a moment.  The fact
that many wiretapping advocates oppose torture raises a host of absolutely
*fascinating* questions:
1)  If it were technically possible to compel us (without pain) to disclose
the contents of our mind, would Dorothy support the application of such
techniques to suspects (under judicial warrants or other lawful authority)?
That is, does the opposition to torture arise from squeamishness about pain
or from some residual recognition of the right of personal autonomy. 2)  Would those who support wiretapping but oppose torture waive their
opposition to torture in certain cases.  That is, if the continued existence
of the United States or indeed Life on Earth were dependent on a bit of
information stored in the brain of a single person, would those who
countenance some invasions of privacy in the social interest allow torture
in these (admittedly) rare cases?
Back to the main thread:
Dorothy, if you oppose torture then you have granted the validity of John's
belief in absolute privacy.  You are merely quibbling about where that zone
of privacy ends.  You might say that the zone of privacy ends at the brain
but that is too narrow a range.  Personal autonomy exists in the technical
sense because only I command my thoughts.  Only I can order my muscles to
move.  I can be chained and tortured and even hooked up to some sort of
electrical apparatus to attempt to short circuit my muscular control and get
my hand to jump but such coercion is pretty crude.  If someone else wants me
to dance a Waltz smoothly or write a paragraph of original material, they
are going to need my cooperation (however secured).  My zone of absolute
privacy extends to those things I can directly control with my thoughts.  This area also extends to communications.  If I arrange things such that no
one else can overhear me and whisper something to another person, then we
both share knowledge that can only be secured by others through torture (and
not always then) or through the decision of one of us to give it up.  The
same thought in two heads is still as much within the zone of privacy as
that thought within one head.  And so on multiplied by 1000.  The zone of
privacy arises from the inability of other people to directly command the
mind of one person or a thousand persons.  We have the control.  Absent
torture, you can't get it if we choose not to give it to you.
Note that this zone already extends beyond the brain case.  It travels down
our nerves to the tips of our fingers and toes.  We command those nerves and
that wiring represents an extension of our brain.  One of the things that we
can do with those nerves is to use them to generate signals of various
kinds.  This signal generation is *also* an extension of our brain.  It is
under our control.  If we like, we can arrange things so that no one else or
only the intended recipient can know our thoughts.  We have that power.  We
have used our zone of privacy to extend its scope.  We have done (continue
to do) it all from inside our brains.  We have not left that sanctuary --
that fortress built by the rejection of torture by advanced societies.
Therefore, if we develop the technical means to *extend* that zone of
privacy beyond our heads, bodies, and those we can whisper to, you can only
break the zone by the torture which you have already eschewed.  The nature
of the zone of privacy is not a grant from the State, it is the result of
our nature as independent *actors* and our collective decision (in the West
at least) to minimize the use of torture by governments.  The Internet itself is an example of individual cooperation to extend
communications channels from one person to many (it was built by its users).
Those same users can, if they choose, use their autonomy to build in
security features of their collective design.  It belongs to them as their
minds belong to them.  It is an extension of those minds.
Dorothy, you or I may not like the thoughts or communications of specific
people but they have the same right to secure those thoughts and
communications if they choose to.
Now in reading all this, you may wonder what this has to do with key escrow
and Gang of Seven (G7) crypto policy.  Dorothy, as virtually the sole
non-government employee who supports Clipper and SKE, I believe you to be
unique in another way.  I think that you can be "saved" from tyranny (which
is always rough on the tyrants).  Unlike the government employees on your
side of the argument, you have generally not favored outlawing private use
of strong crypto.  We would like to separate you from them on this
fundamental question of personal autonomy.  The Century of Blood that the
world has just lived through at the hands of its governments (160 million
murdered) causes many of us to believe that some of your allies (who BTW
currently include the Kingdom of the Saud and the People's Republic of
China) would use torture and other very inhumane means to violate even our
traditional zone of privacy.
If you will merely grant to us the *morality* of our attempt to use the zone
of privacy which you have granted to us to extend that zone of privacy, we
will grant you an understanding of your fears of this new world (which many
of us share).  Please, separate yourself absolutely from the torturers.

Don't forget the bus.  Of course you can still drive a car without a DL.
Just don't get stopped.  Additionally, driving without a license is a pretty
minor offense.  Stick with cheap cars so confiscation isn't a problem.  Most
also forget that the Driver's License can be issued by any nation on earth.
Some countries have easier standards for license issuance.
Strange facts about cars and drivers in the US:
1)  It is legal for an unlicensed driver to own or drive an unregistered car
as long as he stays off the public streets and roads (what for expansion of
the definition of public streets and roads).
2)  It is legal for a licensed driver to drive a car owned by some other
person or legal entity.  Ownership and control can be two different things.
3)  A car can be registered in other states or in other countries and still
be driven anywhere in the US.
4)  A licensed driver is one with a license from any jurisdiction on earth
(try to stick to ones most cops have heard of).
5)  A US court cannot suspend a foreign license (but they can bust you for
other stuff if you get caught in the same local jurisdiction twice.)
At least the Passport doesn't have your address or much useful information
on it.  And if you've done things properly, it's not connected to your SS

Using a Mail Receiving Service (MRS) address will usually work.  Many
bureau-rats have yet to compile or use a list of Mail Receiving Services.
There *are* commercial firms that do compile such lists but they have to be
used to be any good.
In those rare cases where they turn you down for a registration or drivers
license because they happen to notice that you are using a MRS, you can find
a real person to accept your mail for you.  I solved the problem once by
advertizing on Usenet newsgroups for an address and cut a deal.  Another
possibility is to use the "homeless defense."  I'm homeless, this is the
only address I have.  Auto insurance companies are more likely to give you
trouble than government if you use an accommodation address since they have
actual money to lose.  There are still 10 or so states that do not require
auto insurance so by forum shopping, one can dodge this problem and save
money at the same time. Most states are not so fussy, and one can usually just use MRS addresses.
Litigation to force you to list a "real" address is exceedingly rare (it's
not worth the government's time).  This is particularly so since it is
trivial to switch cities, counties, states, and countries (if in the US use
Canada) for official address purposes.  You control your address.  Move into
a hotel/motel that rents by the week, list the address, and then leave.  Even in the Nazi strongholds of Mitteleuropa with their address registration
laws, one can crash with friends or sublet apartments and avoid the process.
Holiday cottages let a month at a time is another technique.  Plenty of
Germans are living unregistered lives even today.
Domicile requires "actual physical presence plus intent to make it your
home."  *Your* actions establish intent not any actions by the government.

There is no such thing as a Fair Price.  There are only the prices paid by

factors influence price including cost of production and product
characteristics but the only determinants are the desire of market actors to
complete transactions at given prices.  You may think that you are smart
enough to decide what a good or service should sell for, but if you're not

mail to your home" but don't say anything about mail receiving services and
so forth.  If you know how, you can even wander into most rural post
offices and get a P.O. box in an area that doesn't have home delivery
without living in the vicinity or proving it.  Addresses are much too
slippery things to control very well with the US model.

The new rule doesn't require that ID be presented at the Post Office.  You
just  have to present the package in person and fill out a form.  They
could try and require ID later, of course.
They have to identify themselves they don't have to present identification

avoided the problem if he'd been smarter.
If they have yet to successfully mandate positive ID for bank or credit

Perhaps if you had read the British Privacy Protection Act (in force since
1984 or so) and similar Continental regs you would see that this sort of
registration was a common method of enforcement.  The PPA is on the WEB and
the Data Protection Registrar (you know as in "registration") has a web page:
"What does the Act mean to computer users?
With few exceptions, if you hold or control personal data on computer, you
must register with the Data Protection Registrar.  Registration is normally
for three years and one standard fee is payable to cover this period.
Registration forms are available from the Registrar's office, including a
special shortened registration form (DPR4) for those who process personal
data only for payroll
and bought/sales ledger purposes.
Computer bureaux which process personal data for others or allow data users
to process personal data on their computers must also register. Their
register entries will contain only their name and address.
Data users and computer bureaux who should register but do not, are
committing a criminal offence, as are those operating outside the
descriptions contained in their register entries. In these cases the
Registrar regularly prosecutes. The penalty for non-registration can be a
fine of up to ï¿½5,000 plus costs in the Magistrates Courts, or an unlimited
fine in the Higher Courts."
Then just pay the higher price personally by not giving other people
information you want to keep private.  Get an accommodation address, use
secured credit cards (or none at all), get a voice mail phone number, lie
when people ask you for info.
You can get health insurance without giving personal data by lying.  You can
get credit from friends and relatives (borrowed credit) or save money first
and use secured credit cards (or bank debit VISA cards) to minimize reporting.
Look, the reason we hate the CDA is because it restricts speech.
Restrictions on credit agencies gossiping about you are also speech
restrictions.  If you are out in the world, people are going to talk about
you.  The credit agencies are much easier to handle and less intrusive than
the women were who talked about you while beating cloth on the rocks in the
stream back in the old village.

Operation Sun Devil happened in 1990.  A couple of BBS' were shut down.  It
hasn't been repeated much since.  There are currently more than 7,000
commercial ISPs in the world.  At one or two shutdowns per decade, it will
take a while.  Note too that an ISP is more like a carrier (common or not)
than like a publisher.  Legal difficulties for the Feds.  Even harder in the
future when 100 million households worldwide have full-time net access
running on real multitasking workstations.
I'm waiting.  Then I'll have to call all the way to Montreal to log on.
They will have a lot of fun trying to *find* all the ISPs though.  There are
quite a few and that still leaves company, academic, government, and private
TCP/IP servers up.
There's not much government infrastructure left on the Net.  The backbone
went private the weekend after the OKC Federal building was blown up.
Defeat is a process that occurs in the mind of the enemy.  If you can
convince them not to fight, you and they are better off.  In any case, you
don't get anywhere by failing to assert your strength.  A declaration of
independence doesn't mean you are independent it is the opening shot in a
conflict by which you win (prove) your independence.
It doesn't consider itself anarchic -- it is.  The IETF reaches decisions by
consensus and the software that becomes part of what we call "the Net"
becomes a part of the Net only when a large enough number of individual
servers decide to run it.
Neither Arpanet nor the Internet were Defense Department networks.  They
were (for a while) academic networks funded (in part) by DOD and many other

These sorts of informal negotiations of the terms of employment are quite
common in life.  Anyone could have been fired at anytime if their
supervisors didn't like what they were doing.  It is blackmail to threaten
to quit only if you are a slave who is not "allowed" to do so.  Here, we can
quit a job any time for any (or no) reason.  Certainly employers both public
and private have benefitted from the development of networking technology.

This obviously hasn't worked.  There's an awful lot of advertizing on the
net these days.
When one goes out into the marketplace, one encounters many different people
and many challenges.  You must win acceptance from some of the other
participants you find there.  There are mores.  You have to learn some of
them or find others of your ilk who already share you mores.  It is not
hard.  It is called life. I've never been bothered.  Tim has had the cops called on him.  We still
post at will.  A short survey of the Feed suggests that many other people
continue to post at will.  Probably too many.  In fact, they obviously feel
freer to do so on the net than in real life.
Opinions differ.
This is not a therapy group.  Compassion is a personal matter.  Certainly LD
is not noted for his compassion.
I hadn't noticed much advocacy of reading private email or turning people in
to the thought police anywhere on the Net.  Perhaps you read some unusual
mailing lists.
In modern capitalist societies like the US, it is possible to actually own
fairly powerful computers yourself.  In fact, I understand that even the
peasantry in America can put together the $200 for a used 386sx and the $39
for a 14.4K modem and run a free copy of Linux and have a powerful TCP/IP
server of their own.  The dialup connection is not permanent of course.  It
can be bought from many local, national, and overseas providers.  Encrypted
TCP/IP to out-country ISPs will make things a bit harder to track.
Severing a contractual relationship with someone (under the terms of that
contract) is not physical coercion and bears no resemblance to physical
coercion.  Those who are "disfellowshipped" by lists or ISPs can find others
who will accept them.
Actually, the ability to control group inclusion and exclusion is the
definition of one sort of a society.  You are arguing that the Net has
become a grouping of various societies and subcultures.  I agree.
We (some of we) don't want the housing or the school funding either.  I
certainly consider slave schools to be the most common form of child abuse
in the world today.
Don't go out of your way.  Just stay out of our way.  Play golf instead.  Use another domain name.  Internic doesn't even have a monopoly of domain
name assignment within the US.  If it casually screws around with too many
people, it will guarantee further loss in market share.  How, exactly, is
there going to be a massive pulling of IP addresses.  That sounds like an
awful lot of expensive litigation to me.  Court orders don't come cheap even
if the Feds do buy them wholesale.  They'll lose that predator hunt energy
balance equation as long as it costs me virtually nothing so set up a new
net presence somewhere else but it costs them $thousands per "takedown."
In this century alone, the governments of the world have murdered more than
160 million people.  The Net has very few murders to its (dis)credit.  If
flaming is the worst we ever do...
I've found JPB to be reasonably realistic for one "of the left."  This
debate is *about* who is the most "realistic" the regulators or the
anti-regulators.  So far, the regulators haven't done too well.  Time will
tell.  In any case, it's way too early to declare the game over.  As for
"realism."  One may be permitted to doubt the realism of those who expect
massive physical raids to shut down the net.  That sort of thing worked (for
a while) in commie countries but it's never even been tried here.  If they
are going to do it, they'd better do it soon before the net triples in size
again.  This is *original*?
This happens to be how Barlow spends most of this time.  Many of us as well.
Now there's a *real* breach of netiquette.  Remind me not to give my real

No.  But I do claim that their view doesn't mean much in an age in which

Look.  Coercion-based systems like government depend on a power balance
tipped far in their direction.  They start to break down as individuals and
small groups gain levels of power that are more equal to theirs.  If we can
overturn one of their commands with five minutes of keyboarding, that
command can't stand.  The stability of past systems was based on the fact
that 90% of the population couldn't do anything no matter what happened.
They had to stay where they were and grow food or they would starve.  It's
not hard to rule people in that situation.  We aren't in that situation any

of communication we have weakens their hold on that acquiescence.

@_subject: "Physical Reality" 
Various critics of cryptoanarchy from D. Denning to L. Detweiler to A.
Grove, to J. Kellstrom to the 1991 instance of P. Metzger have argued that
the continued existence of the physical attack medium renders this new form
of social disorganization DOA.
Boiled down to its essentials, this argument can be expressed by the lyrics
of the song "Bad Boys" as used as the theme song of the reality TV show
"Cops."  For those who no longer participate in the previous culture, they are:
Bad Boys, Bad Boys
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do when they come for you? Bad Boys, Bad Boys
repeat endlessly.
I would suggest instead that the critics of cryptoanarchy are out of touch
with "physical reality."
For the "Bad Boys" to come for you, a whole series of requirements must be
in place:
1)  There must be Bad Boys
2)  They must be able to travel
3)  There must be a reason for them to come "for you".  They need motivation
4)  There must be a you
5)  The Bad Boys must know where you are
6)  The Bad Boys must be able to travel to where you are
7)  The answer to the question "Whatcha gonna do?" must be "nothing" (This
would seem to be implied by the song.)
8)  They must have something to do to you when they "come for you" otherwise
the journey is a waste of time.
Let's examine each of these requirements to see how technological change has
affected them.
1)  There must be Bad Boys
There are fewer Bad Boys these days.  Not that Human Nature has improved all
that much but law enforcement employment (relative to population) is down.
The collapse of the SU and the Eastern European police states has
dramatically reduced the world population of government agents.  When 1/4 of
your population was in the enforcement business full- or part-time (as in
the DDR), the end of that system reduces the supply of "muscle."  Note that
during this Century of Blood, governments were murdering someone every 20
seconds or so (160 million in the last 100 years).  Reports indicate that
the death rate is lower these days.  Occasional minutes go by without any
murders by government.  Additionally, even in places like the US where there would seem to be more
enforcement personnel employed than ever before, bureaucratic management has
worked to reduce worker productivity.  Since law enforcement is still
organized along Stalinist lines (state ownership and management,
hierarchical organization, pay unrelated to performance), not much actual
enforcement is undertaken.  A New York Times article on INS agents whose job
it is to find and arrest illegals within the US said that they were allowed
to grab about one perp a month.  The rest of the time was spent on
paperwork.  At the rate of 12 deportations a year per agent, it will be
quite a while before the backlog is cleared.  And, indeed, all the evidence
we have from studies of the "clearance" rates of crimes to the street price
of illegal pharmacuticals, to the "average time served per crime" suggest
that effective enforcement is down.
This is what we would expect since the law enforcement system has retained a
very traditional organizational model while the rest of society has become
much more efficient.  A massive increase in what we might call "regulatory
targets" combined with a decrease in the number and efficiency of the
regulators, means less regulation and effectively fewer Bad Boys.
2)  They must be able to travel
If the Bad Boys are to come for you, they have to be able to travel.  The
internationalization of the modern business and communications environment
has made this more difficult.  There are very few enforcement agencies that
have unlimited budgets of the sort that allowed Lt. Gerard to chase Dr.
Richard Kimball around the country for years on end.  Enforcement is largely
a matter of chance.  The Bad Boys come for some small part of the criminal
population and leave the rest alone until chance brings them within reach.
A multinational investigation and enforcement program costs the earth.  It
will only be undertaken in very significant cases.  Nation states are still
the basic unit of enforcement and so jurisdictional conflicts cause many
costs and delays.  Since it is part of human nature to be more concerned
with one's own "stuff" than with other's "stuff," foreign enforcement
agencies won't pursue cases with as much energy as domestic agencies might
be willing to.  One way that people are more powerful than governments is that people (or
their corporations) can be citizens/residents of several nations much more
easily than a single nation can rule the citizens/residents of other nations.
Even within the United States, jurisdictional differences among the states
can be exploited by natural or artificial persons.  As regional trading
blocks like NAFTA and the European Free Trade Area spread, people will be
able to move around much more easily than government agencies.  Since there
are no sovereignty issues raised when people do business in multiple
jurisdictions, these distance and jurisdictional barriers will fall much
faster for private parties than for the government Bad Boys who want to come
after them.

Bad Boys, Bad Boys
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do when they come for you? Bad Boys, Bad Boys
repeat endlessly.
We did 1) & 2) yesterday.  Here are some more points.
3)  There must be a reason for them to come "for you".  They need motivation.
As people go through their ordinary day-to-day lives, they do a lot of
things that weaken government control mechanisms without directly
confronting them.  The whole development of modern capitalism, the modern
finance markets, and the modern telecoms environment are examples of the
wild flowers of individual power growing up in the garden of the state
economy.  Note that governments used to control wages, prices, interest rates, and
capital flows.  In the US, we had Regulation Q which capped the interest
rates banks and S&Ls could pay.  Ownership of gold by Americans was banned.
Most European countries had strict exchange controls as did most of the 3rd
world.  Computers which made money market mutual funds possible and
telecommunications which made rapid funds transfer possible ended most of
these controls without any violent confrontations.  If you are borrowing
"overnight funds" from Tokyo, it's a little difficult to seize them because
they disappear at midnight.  If a restriction is easy to bypass, it tends to
die.  Controls on capital flows have died because the holders of capital
don't have to pay attention to those controls.
The first phase of the electronic revolution freed the large financial
institutions that could afford to play the international funds transfer
game.  Retail electronic funds transfer will free everybody else.
Now this liberation of money may not seem to mean much but if money is free,
it results in other freedoms.  It is hard to control people who have control
of their own funds.  They can just move on you.
Obviously, the ease of creating artificial entities and the use of some of
the privacy protecting tools pioneered by cypherpunks can play a role in
hiding out from the Bad Boys as well.  Everything that makes a target harder
to find reduces the number of hits.  Louis Freeh complained during the great
net kiddie porn bust of 1995 that some of the perps had encrypted their
files and this made them harder to prosecute.
In general, the sheer growth of business and communications makes it much
harder to identify investigatory targets.  As markets, networks, and
communications double and then double again, the Bad Boys have too much
territory to search.  They get spread too thin.

Sometimes in the day-to-day wrangling with the net censors, we forget the
larger picture.  There is an assumption here and in the media (see the
Newsweek year-end piece on the nets by Steven Levy) that the prospect of 2
years in stir and $100,000 fines will quell net speech.  This seems unlikely
because of the nature of the medium.
Thought control is a very difficult task.  It always has been.  The
Inquisition,  Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of
China tried but three of the four are no longer with us.  Short of
totalitarian controls, thought controls will be ineffective.  And
totalitarian controls are difficult to impose these days.
It used to be said that no country would be allowed to move from Communism
to Capitalism.  It can now be said that it is inconceivable that a modern
country will move from a Market to a Command Economy.  Market discipline is
Since only totalitarians have a shot (for a short time) to enforce thought
control, the OECD countries will not succeed at thought control.  This used
to be unimportant because one's thoughts were trapped in one's head.  You
could speak only to a few people and "mass media" from books to TV was
expensive, centralized and somewhat easy to control.  You were free in your
mind but cut off from communicating your thoughts freely to others.
Those conditions no longer exist.  If you can think it (or even not think
it) you can communicate it easily and cheaply to others.  Since thought is
free and communications is almost free, control by others is difficult.
The net is a fair mapping of the consciousness of its participants onto a
world spanning communications system.
Large companies and even quite small businesses are concerned about legal
hassles.  They have an investment to lose and they are more likely to be
prosecuted than ordinary individuals.  Ordinary people rightly suspect that
their risk of punishment is quite low.  Particularly since if they are
worried about it, they can take many easy steps to protect themselves.
In the coming world in which millions of households have multitasking
computers with full-time highspeed connections to the nets, Java-like
applets running wild, etc; the opportunities to stash info in easily
accessible but hard to trace forms expands without limit.
I was trying to imagine over the weekend how the Feds would regulate the
Net.  Will Janet and her Storm troopers (wearing Nazi-style bucket helmets)
smash into the next meeting of the Internet Engineering Task Force and lock
everyone up or force them at gunpoint to adopt standards proposed by the
government?  And if they do, will their code be any good and will it be
accepted by enough nodes to make a difference?  Unlikely in the extreme.
Where are the pressure points where regulation can be applied?
To me, it looks like King Canute ordering back the tide.

All of these statements are sometimes decent and sometimes

point of using the "indecency" standard.
Consider the similar problem of defining the crime of Blasphemy:
"Jesus Christ, the Messiah is God"
Blasphemy because it claims that a man as God.
"The Messiah has not yet come."
Blasphemy because it denies the divinity of Jesus.
We solved this problem in the US by legalizing all such speech.  That is the
only way to handle the similar decency/indecency definition problems.

with Interchange. In doing so AT&T is taking a leaf out of Microsoft Corp.'s book which in
December changed tack to open its online service for free to Internet users.
The move may be replicated in other online companies, analysts say.

Idiots Guide to Reading Banned Newsgroups via CompuServe
CompuServe (alone among the Big Three) gives all subscribers a PPP
connection to the Net through any CIS node (including those in Germany).
This is a real Net connection that makes it possible to use CIS to fully
access all the Net's resources including "banned" newsgroups.
A Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) connection makes your computer just another
machine on the Net for the time you are connected.  Anything that any
Net-connected machine can do, you can do.  The CompuServe Dialer (formerly
CompuServe Internet Dialer) software that has been included with WINCIM at
least since version 1.4 gives you a PPP connection but you need additional
newsreading software to dodge CompuServe restrictions.
So for real beginners, here is how you can use your CompuServe account to
access  banned newsgroups as well as the rest of the Internet.  These
instructions are for Windows users.  MAC users can do the same things but I
don't know the available MAC software.
1)  Get the latest copy of WINCIM.  GO WINCIM (hit Ctrl-G and type WINCIM in
the dialog box) from within CIS.  Download is free.  Install it according to
the instructions and make sure that you can log on to CIS.
2)  Next, let's get a copy of Freeagent which is a free usenet newsreader
which works with CompuServe's own Internet connection software.  Log on to
CIS.  GO FTP or:  Click the Internet icon, click the File Downloads (FTP)
icon and proceed to the main FTP screen.  Click the Access a Specific Site
button.  3)  Enter ftp.forteinc.com in the Site Name box and /pub/free_agent in the
Directory box.  Click OK and you should see some site login information.
Click OK again and you should see a check box next to the file name
fagent10.zip.  Click the check box and then click the Retrieve button.
Wincim will show you that it will save the file in the Compuserv\download
directory on your hard drive.  (Remember where it's going.)  744279 bytes
later, you will have a copy of Freeagent.
4)  Move the file fagent.zip into a directory by itself (C:\AGENT for
example).  Unzip it with Pkunzip or one of the many zip utilities available
on CIS.
5)  What you are going to do is to connect directly to the Internet via
CompuServe and read usenet newsgroups using Freeagent.  In order to do that,
you will need to find a site somewhere on the Net that will let you read
Usenet News for free or you will have to obtain an account on another
Internet-connected machine.
6)  Community ConneXion (c2.org) will give a month of free service to
CompuServe members suffering from censorship.  For information send email to
uncensored at c2.org.  After your free month, c2.org costs only $7.50 a month
for accounts accessed via the Internet.  7)  There are some news servers out there that are open to the public.  A
news server is just a machine connected to the Internet that stores and
forwards Usenet news.  The IP addresses of two of the open news servers are
198.70.185.5 and 205.139.39.1.  Once you become a sophisticated user of the
nets, you can use your Web Browser to pick up a longer list of open news
servers at 8)  Now back to Free Agent to grab those banned newsgroups.  In your WINCIM
directory (maybe in a subdirectory called \cid), click cid.exe to start
CompuServe (Internet) Dialer or find the phone-shaped dialer icon in your
CompuServe group window.  Inside the Dialer, hit dial to log on to the Internet.
9)  Start Free Agent.  Click Accept to accept the license agreement.  It
will prompt you to enter various information including the address of the
news server you want to use, your email address, and other info.  All that
you have to enter is the address of a news server.  In the box labeled "News
(NNTP) Server:" enter one of the IP addresses of open news servers
(198.70.185.5, 205.139.39.1, or another from the list) or the address of the
news server of a system you've opened an account on (news.c2.org, for example).
10)  Freeagent will ask you if it's OK to retrieve a list of news groups
from the server.  Click Yes.  Free agent will then tell you that it is
Retrieving complete List of Groups.  Once that's finished you'll be ready to
read all the newsgroups you want and neither CompuServe nor the Bavarian
prosecutor will have anything to say about it.

No.  For example, the San Francisco Chronicle can be sold or given to minors

newspapers, magazines, and books.  The Supremes have upheld time, place, and
manner restrictions on over-the-air broadcast of indecent material (The
Seven Words You Can't Say on Television), but these restrictions do not
apply to cable or even to broadcast later at night.   Obscene is different from indecent.  What Congress is attempting to do is
apply conventional broadcast TV and radio regulation to the Internet and
other computer networks in spite of the fact that they are not like those
systems and in any case those systems are supposed to be in the process of
being deregulated themselves. But the protections are phony because ISPs have to bend over backwards to
block their systems from being used to transmit indecent material.  It just

@_subject: Net Control is Thought Control 
On CSPAN Friday morning a gentlemen who is, I take it, a lobbyist for TPC or
the Competitive Long Distance Coalition (TPCs) said that the Internet could
be regulated just like magazines, tv, or anything else.  I have long doubted
statements like this particularly since they come from people without
apparent experience on the Net.
I have long suggested that net control=thought control and will prove as
difficult in the modern world as the more conventional thought control
itself.  But why is net control just a form of thought control?
It is difficult for others to control our thoughts because they are
insubstantial, hidden, and under our control.  Small groups (family,
village, etc) have a better chance of influencing what we think but even
they are not totally successful.  Governments who wanted to engage in
thought control have usually set up government schools for this purpose with
mixed results.
Liberal societies (broadly defined) have loosened many of the traditional
controls on our thoughts exercised by our families and neighbors.  They have
tried to replace these controls with bureaucratic thought control systems
with limited success.  Only the totalitarian states have done much of a job
in this area but not enough (obviously) to save themselves from destruction.
There has been a general decline in the effectiveness of thought control
since the Industrial Revolution made (atomistic) individualism possible and
books cheap.
The Nets are the next step in this process.  Since they allow our thoughts
to easily, rapidly, and cheaply  leap from our minds to a world-wide
communications medium, our minds are in some sense extended worldwide.  It
becomes cheap and easy for anyone to publish their thoughts.  The dramatic
changes occasioned by the mechanical production of cheap pulp paper and
steam-driven printing presses in the 19th century will be as nothing
compared to effects of the speed and reach of Net "publishing."
In addition to expanding the scope of our thoughts, the Nets also give us
new powers of secret communication.  Modern encryption and anonymity
technology lets us both keep our thoughts secret and communicate them to
anyone else who is interested.  Quite an expansion of the capabilities of
"the thought in the brain."
Also, the Nets allow us to find others of our ilk (however small and deviate
that may be) who offer support to us in our thoughts.  This further reduces
the power of traditional thought controls exercised by our immediate
communities.  Since my immediate community has included Cypherpunks since
February 1993, I am less likely to be influenced "locally" on topics of
Cypherpunk interest.  The normal primate tendency to look to the "troop" for
guidance in what to think and do is sabotaged by our ability to find our own
reinforcing communities where ever we like.  So even less thought control is
As we users know and non-users will find out, the Nets are not "just another
medium" like books, magazines, and TV (just as those were not "just another
medium" in their day).  Control of the Nets will prove as difficult as the
control of thoughts themselves.

'labeling' and info controls), booze and cigarette advertizing, EEOC

The book suggests that small differences in perceived quality (or even
'luck') result in a big difference in marketplace results (whether for
product or labor).  The title is a bit misleading.  It should be "The
Winner-Take-Lots Society" since it does not say that non-winners are left
with nothing (that thesis is promoted in other recent works of fiction.)
These GenX whining tomes and commie sociology texts are just the latest
examples of the old automation-will-cause-mass-unemployment
the-unemployed arguments.  So far, a higher percentage of Americans are in
paid employment than ever before in history.  Likewise once you factor out
changes in the workforce mix, similarly situated workers continue to rake in
more "total compensation" than ever before.
Remember comparative advantage.  Just because Tim can apply his knowledge of
physics to the chip fab process better than anyone and make big bucks,

purchases the goods and labor of many other people.  It may be true that a
disproportionate share of the gains accrue to "the elite" but if everyone
else is vastly richer than their forebearers, what difference does it make?

@_subject: Spiderspace, Privacy & Control 
All of these capabilities might seem to increase the control opportunities
of others but for the fact that our opportunities for independent
interaction have increased much faster.
All the modern control technologies have been blown out of the water because
of the single significant fact that a network creates more connections than
anyone else can block.  And this is true whether that network is called a
"market" or an "Internet."  Liberty can be defined as an opportunity to complete "transactions."
Control may be defined as the capability to block another from completing
"transactions."  The "lowest chained serf in the fields" has few
opportunities to complete "transactions" or to make choices.  Even if his
legal status were different, the fact that he is bound to the soil by
necessity if not law restrains his liberty.  He can't go anywhere or do
anything.  If he is in a lightly populated place like the Northern Europe of
old, his "world" contains about 100 people.  If he is in a densely populated
place like a Chinese river valley he still only has about 1000 people in his
village to deal with.  Nature constrains his choices so much that only a
minor effort by "society" is required to completely restrain him.
A modern market and a modern telecoms infrastructure is so vast and is made
up of so many potential links that it takes a major and very expensive
application of human force to even slightly restrain other people.  Since
each of us can buy  from or sell to, talk to, form attachments with
literally millions (and soon billions) of other people (and companies and
software robots, etc) the opportunities for others to control us are
limited.  Very expensive prisons, criminal justice systems, credit bureaus,
and employment records systems are inadequate to keep us from doing much of
what we want.  Which is why an allegedly "controlled" world seems a lot less
controlled than the world of the past.
Among all of the potential "transactions" that we can choose to complete (T)
are a subset of transactions (t) that give us outcomes closer to what we
actually want.  In the past, the best representation of this transaction
space was T=t=1.  The total transactions were very limited (subsistence
farming in the place and among the people of our birth).  We were stuck.
Today we are approaching a situation in which for all practical purposes T=~
and t=~ and the all of the possibilities make the match between what we want
and what we can get very close.
So if one government or one employer or one friend is not "right" for us,
there are millions more where that came from.  We aren't there yet but we
are getting there.  No matter how peculiar your exact nature, there are so
many markets and people out there that very few people on earth will be
unable to find a niche.
If your needs are esoteric, you may have to shop around a bit but all these
great search tools sure make that easier.
Thus if I write something that upsets a government or an employer, there are
other governments and other employers (including myself in both cases).  In
fact, I am likely to find some "small, deeply disturbed following" that
actually likes what I have to say.  There are an awful lot of people out there.
It's like the Bill Mauldin cartoon featuring a skinny, ugly, GI with a funny
big curl on his head driving through an Italian hill town full of ugly,
skinny people with giant curls on their heads -- "Gee, my Daddy told me I'd
find a place like this."  That village is already part of Market Earth (tm)
and is (or soon will be on the Net).
With the millions of choices each of us has, restricting those choices
quickly becomes impossible outside of prison and prisons become ever harder
to maintain because of cost and countermeasures.  (The Soviet Union, for

factors of its production (discounted to present value).  We noticed that
there is a difference between the social and technical capabilities of
modern math and modern computing on the one hand and the public perception
of those capabilities on the other.  By simply pointing out those mistakes
in public perception and doing some (as little as possible) coding to prove
it, we've gained some publicity.
An example of the gap between perception and reality that we can easily
exploit, I would point to the regulation of broadcasting.  There's a lot of
talk with the telecoms bill about whether and how much broadcasting should
be deregulated but it is obvious to us that it already has been.  I was thinking of that while doing my mail and listening to the Leader of

               [Responses by Duncan Frissell in square brackets]
Although May limply asserts that anarchy does not mean lawlessness and
social disorder, the absence of government would lead to exactly these
states of chaos. [Tim is rarely given to limp assertions.  I haven't seen him spend much time
arguing about the exact social arrangements of a free society following the
crypto revolution.  He has merely pointed out the results of the technology.]
I do not want to live in an anarchistic society -- if such could be called a
society at all -- and I doubt many would. [Whatever happens, there will always be plenty of cults around (perhaps even
one called the Government of the United States of America) to which anyone
will be free to belong and at the altars of which one will be free to
worship.  In fact the deregulation of human interaction will make it easier
for more oppressive cults to exist than is possible today as long as they
keep to themselves.  There will be no shortage of people willing to tell
their followers what to do.  Nothing will stop anyone from joining such a
A growing number of people are attracted to the market liberalism envisioned
by Jefferson, Hayek, and many others, but not to anarchy. Thus, the crypto
anarchists' claims come close to asserting that the technology will take us
to an outcome that most of us would not choose.
[Still up for negotiation is how liberal a market we will want.  The growing
power of markets and (traditional) liberal ideas is the result of the
growing wealth and power of individuals around the world.  Crypto anarchists
merely point out that the shape of future market societies is no longer in
the hands of "The Authorities" but is rather in the hands of those trading
on the market; i.e., everyone on Earth."]
This is the claim that I want to address here. I do not accept crypto
anarchy as the inevitable outcome. A new paradigm of cryptography, key
escrow, is emerging and gaining acceptance in industry.
[That is what remains to be seen.]
The drawbacks of cryptography are frequently overlooked as well. The
widespread availability of unbreakable encryption coupled with anonymous
services could lead to a situation where practically all communications are
immune from lawful interception (wiretaps)
[My thoughts are immune from 'lawful interception' as are everyone else's
and yet the world survives.  Thought is communication within the brain.
Communication is 'thought' between brains.  The world which has survived
private thoughts can survive private communications.  The whole concept of
controlling communications is a bit obsolete in any case.  In past eras, the
only social threat came from large masses of men (hence the desire to
intercept and control communications) whereas today any individual can do
more damage than a large group in the past.]
and documents from lawful search and seizure, and where all electronic
transactions are beyond the reach of any government regulation or oversight.
The consequences of this to public safety and social and economic stability
could be devastating. [See the recent joint study by the Cato Institute, the Fraser Institute, and
9 other think tanks world wide showing that there is a strong positive
correlation between nations with free economies and nations with wealth.
There seems little doubt that total economic deregulation is a good thing.
We shall certainly have the chance to test that hypothesis in coming years.
I haven't seen any nation harmed so far by having too free an economy.]
With the government essentially locked out, computers and telecommunications
systems would become safe havens for criminal activity. Even May himself
acknowledges that crypto anarchy provides a means for tax evasion, money
laundering, espionage (with digital dead drops), [That is, keeping your own money, transferring funds, and research.  Sounds
like activities that should not be the concern of others.]
contract killings,
[These may be easier although *government* killings will be harder since
governments may lack the resources to do as much of that sort of thing as
they have done before.  (From 1917-1989, Communist governments murdered
someone every 30 seconds -- a total of some 60 million people.)  In
addition, those who fear they may be the subject of contract killings can
use pseudonyms, locational ambiguity, and untraceable communications to make
themselves harder to find and thus to kill.]
and implementation of data havens for storing and marketing illegal or
controversial material. [Last time I looked, controversial material was legal to possess and
transmit.  Illegal information will no longer be illegal if its transmission
can't be stopped since utterly unenforceable laws tend to go away (see
Sodomy).] Encryption also threatens national security by interfering with foreign
intelligence operations. The United States, along with many other countries,
imposes export controls on encryption technology to lessen this threat.
[Of course if the US is weakened by the growth of (really) free markets, its
enemies will be as well so foreign threats will automatically diminish.] Cryptography poses a threat to organizations and individuals too. With
encryption, an employee of a company can sell proprietary electronic
information to a competitor without the need to photocopy and handle
physical documents.
[This is a threat from digitization, not from encryption.]
The keys that unlock a corporation's files may be lost, corrupted, or held
hostage for ransom, thus rendering valuable information inaccessible. [Or the computers can not be backed up, can crash, can be blown up, can be
flooded, can experience disk failures, etc.  This is not a problem unique to
encryption.  Backups and scattered sites are always necessary.  High-speed
networks, secure communications, and encryption make it easier to back up
your systems at different locations all over the world.  They help you avoid
data loss, they don't contribute to it.  Key splitting and private key
escrow can easily protect keys.]
When considering the threats posed by cryptography, it is important to
recognize that only the use of encryption for confidentiality, including
anonymity, presents a problem. [Of course confidentiality is the reason codes were invented in the first
place.  Additionally, the Supreme court has recognized that anonymity has
First Amendment protection.  We have already made the social decision that
anonymity is OK in many circumstances.  I'm sure that all of us engage in
many anonymous transactions on a daily basis and yet the world survives.]
Crypto anarchy can be viewed as the proliferation of cryptography that
provides the benefits of confidentiality protection but does nothing about
its harms. It is government-proof encryption which denies access to the
government even under a court order or other legal order.
[In countries that don't regularly practice torture, we have the power to
disobey court orders in any case.  Modern technology merely makes it easier
and reduces the likelihood of punishment.  Court orders are rare in any
case.  Seems like much ado about nothing.]  It has no safeguards to protect users and their organizations from accidents
and abuse.
[This is the job of those who write software, not philosophers.]
The crypto anarchist position is that cyberspace is on a non-stop drift
toward crypto anarchy.
[I usually argue that the spread of markets is driven more by cheap telecoms
and the growth of a very efficient market infrastructure.  Cryptography
hasn't had much of an impact yet.  I think that even without crypto, markets
will swamp attempts to regulate them and since people can move as well, they
are becoming harder to control even before any crypto revolution.]
In addition to the free encryption programs being distributed on the net,
encryption is becoming a basic service integrated into commercial
applications packages and network products. The IP Security Working Group of
the Internet Engineering Task Force has written a document that calls for
all compliant IPv6 (Internet Protocol, version 6) implementations to
incorporate DES cryptography.
[The net belongs to its customers and as owners they will probably decide to
secure their property.  Sounds enormously democratic to me.]
The potential harms of cryptography have already begun to appear. As the
result of interviews I conducted in May, 1995, I found numerous cases where
investigative agencies had encountered encrypted communications and computer
files. These cases involved child pornography, [Possession of a bunch of zeros and ones.]
customs violations
[free trade]
[the retail pharmaceutical trade]
[finally a crime]
[Another crime.  Can you give us the details of a murder investigation
blocked by cryptography?  We don't need any names.]
obstruction of justice
[Refusal to make things easy for prosecutors.  A *real* crime.  This wasn't
Hillary by any chance, was it?]
tax protesters
[You mean tax evaders, don't you?  Far as I know, protesting taxes is a
legal activity.]
and terrorism.
[State-sponsored or private?]
At the International Cryptography Institute held in Washington in September,
1995, FBI Director Louis Freeh reported that encryption had been encountered
in a terrorism investigation in the Philippines involving an alleged plot to
assassinate Pope John Paul II and bomb a U.S. airliner [4].
[But the perp was caught anyway.  Is this the same Louis Freeh who thinks
that the loss (by him) of a government cellphone is just as bad as the FBI
issuing shoot-to-kill orders against American citizens before even trying to
arrest them (since he punished both with a letter of reprimand)?]
AccessData Corp., a company in Orem, Utah which specializes in providing
software and services to help law enforcement agencies and companies recover
data that has been locked out through encryption, reports receiving about a
dozen and a half calls a day from companies with inaccessible data.
[Sounds like poor system design.  I'm not sure that advising others how to
safely store their business records has anything to do with law enforcement,
The idea is to combine strong encryption with an emergency decryption
capability. This is accomplished by linking encrypted data to a data
recovery key which facilitates decryption. This key need not be (and
typically is not) the one used for normal decryption, but it must provide
access to that key. The data recovery key is held by a trusted fiduciary,
which could conceivably be a governmental agency, court, or trusted and
bonded private organization. A key might be split among several such agencies. [Why would a government agency or a court be the best entity to provide
business services?  If I'm looking for someone to install a LAN in my
office, I don't immediately think to call the Post Office and get them to
bid on the job.  Business services like data backup and recovery are much
more likely to be efficiently accomplished by a private contractor.] Organizations registered with an escrow agent can acquire their own keys for
decryption. An investigative or intelligence agency seeking access to
communications or stored files makes application through appropriate
procedures (which normally includes getting a court order) and, upon
compliance, is issued the key. [But what if it turns out that my chosen escrow agent is located outside the
jurisdiction of the court.  Surely you don't want to cause any NAFTA or GATT
problems here.  The WTO might declare your encryption policy to be an unfair
trade practice.]  Legitimate privacy interests are protected through access procedures,
auditing, and other safeguards.
[But what if some of us want better protection than bureaucratic promises
and procedures.  Some people in the past who relied on government promises
and procedures ended up in crowded "shower" rooms trying to extract oxygen
from diesel exhaust.].
In April, 1993, as response to a rising need for and use of encryption
products, the Clinton Administration announced a new initiative to promote
encryption in a way that would not prohibit lawful decryption when
investigative agencies are authorized to intercept communications or search
computer files [6].
[And a rousing success it was.]
The IBAG principles acknowledge the right of businesses and individuals to
protect their information and the right of law-abiding governments to
intercept and lawfully seize information when there is no practical
alternative. [Is a communist dictatorship a "law abiding government?"]
The principles call for industry to develop open voluntary, consensus,
international standards and for governments, businesses, and individuals to
work together to define the requirements for those standards. The standards
would allow choices about algorithm, mode of operation, key length, and
implementation in hardware or software. Products conforming to the standards
would not be subject to restrictions on import or use and would be generally
[Gee, I thought that was what we were doing.]
It is conceivable that domestic and international efforts will be sufficient
to avoid crypto anarchy, particularly with support from the international
business community. However, it is possible that they will not be enough.
Many companies are developing products with strong encryption that do not
accommodate government access, standards groups are adopting non-key escrow
standards, and software encryption packages such as PGP are rapidly
proliferating on the Internet, which is due, in part, to the crypto
anarchists whose goal is to lock out the government.  Since key escrow adds
to the development and operation costs of encryption products, the price
advantage of unescrowed encryption products could also be a factor which
might undermine the success of a completely voluntary approach.
[Sounds like the voluntary cooperation of human beings in international
markets is just humming right along isn't it?  It seems that a lot of market
participants are "voting with their feet" for strong crypto.  The System is
the Solution.]
Under this licensing program, commercial encryption products, including
programs distributed through public network servers, would comply with
government regulations. [Isn't a "public network server" just a server that is made world readable?
Since there will be (conservatively) 100 million "public network servers"
online in a few years, won't enforcement be a trifle difficult?]
Such an approach would not prevent the use of government-proof encryption
products by criminals and terrorists.  They could develop their own or
acquire the products illegally. But an approach of this type would make it
considerably more difficult than it is at present. Had such controls been
adopted several years ago -- before programs such as DES and PGP were posted
on the Internet -- the encryption products on the market today would support
key escrow or some other method for government access.
[As I recall, wasn't public key encryption developed in spite of the fact
that the NSA had in place an unofficial ban on cryptographic research?  The
NSA's ban failed.  Since you are not proposing outlawing such research, what
makes you think that mere distribution controls will work? ]
It would not be possible to acquire strong, government-proof encryption from
reputable vendors or network file servers. The encryption products available
through underground servers and the black market would most likely not
possess as high a quality as products developed through the legitimate market. [The Internet itself runs primarily on software developed on the open market
from non-commercial sources without slick packaging.  It seems to have met
with some market acceptance in spite of the lack of shrink-wrap packaging.]
Crypto anarchy is an international threat which has been stimulated by
international communications systems including telephones and the Internet.
Addressing this threat requires an international approach that provides for
both secure international communications crossing national boundaries and
electronic surveillance by governments of criminal and terrorist activity
taking place within their jurisdictions. [It's nice to be noticed.  How, exactly, is this voluntary, international,
standards regime going to deal with the desire of different governments to
control different communications.  Look at the problems, some governments
want to ban American movies, the Asian Wall Street Journal, books on the
health of former heads of state, public records of sensational murder
trials, phone calls made using callback services, financial wire services,
novels by leftist co-religionists living in England, email containing the
English word for sexual intercourse (if readable by children),  directions
on where to obtain an abortion in London, etc.  And all these governments
will want to crack private transmissions in order to find those responsible
for these "crimes."  This is going to be a hell of a challenge for a
voluntary, international standards regime.  I think it is probably beyond
the capabilities of such an institution to mediate among all of these
competing desires to control the communications of others.]

Actually, if you place a child in one sort of environment or another you do
get a different "product."  The behavior of Amish children raised on farms
in rural Pennsylvania differs significantly from the behavior of children
raised crack-addicted parents in Bed-Stuy.  In fact, you get almost
non-overlapping bell curves for every characteristic.  I would guess too
that if you switched kids at birth between these two populations, the final
results wouldn't differ by much.  What parents are attempting to do when they restrain their children's access
to "sex and drugs and rock and roll" (or Republicanism for that matter) is
to mediate their "spiritual" environment to keep them from becoming
hardened.  They know the kids will grow up, they just want them to grow up
in a nice way.
Children who listen to Vera Lynn's singing and Cole Porter's songs will end
up quite different from those who favor louder, less vocal music.  Note that
in spite of what liberals might think, fundamentalist christians are less
likely to divorce, less likely to report spousal beatings, less likely to
kill themselves, and more likely to measure high personal satisfaction
levels on standard psychological tests than are, say, readers of The Nation.
The cypherpunks relevance of all this is that it should soon be possible to
create completely mediated environments for ourselves and our children.
Through the use of implants and real-time VR processing, it will be possible
to edit our "interface" with the Real World such that unpleasant aspects are
edited out.  We will be able to change the attire, hair, facial expressions,
voice, and even smell of those around us to conform to our own esthetic
desires.  Likewise with our physical surroundings.  Safety may discourage
making a complete transformation in one's surroundings, but one can
certainly soften the edges.
Note that this is just an easier-to-implement version of what we can do
already with our own minds.
It will be interesting to see the effects on people who live in these
mediated worlds.  "My grandmother didn't like to use the word 'Democrats' in the presence of

On the other hand, I'm not sure that Tim's pessimism is warranted.  This
argument that cities will become completely unlivable and the only way to
survive is to move out into less populated areas has been going on in the
libertarian, survivalist, and right-wing-nut communities since the 1960s.
The magazines Vonulife and Libertarian Connection used to talk a lot about
the relative merits of Nomadism or Troglodytism, suitcase nukes, and such.  Those who took the advice and moved into caves in 1969 have sure had an
uncomfortable 30 years.  Mel Tappan (author of Survival Guns) may have died
from a heart attack which he could have survived had he not moved into the
boonies.  I note as well that Tim is not all that far away from civilization
and its discontents.  North Dakota or Labrador would be better choices if
separation were really desired.
Those of us in the Techno-Libertarian Panglossian Community argue that it is
at least possible that the spread of markets will serve to bend the world's
population to bourgeois values before nanotech gives everyone the power to
destroy the world.
Note that markets (like networks) can expand faster than outside observers
can believe once a critical mass of participants is achieved.  We see that
happening all around the world in the case of both markets and networks.
Even hard cases like Africa and the Middle East will find themselves swept
up in a short time (by historical standards).  It's hard to get people who

My real problem with the whole thing is that Ritalin is being prescribed by
government employees in most cases.  It thus constitutes behavior
modification of the population by the government which is certainly a human
rights violation.  It is arguably a First Amendment violation for the
government to chemically prevent you from expressing yourself in certain
ways.  They should not even be allowed to advocate such treatment.    Obviously, I have no problem if private individuals acting alone or in
consultation with other private individuals decide to tank themselves up to
the gills (as long as they buy their own drogas) but government
"suggestions" for B-Mod should be very troubling to most of the readers of
this list.
Like religion, if you are crazy enough to ask your government what
mind-altering drugs you should take, the government should say -- "No
Comment.  That's up to you."
Government does not exist for the benefit of the governed.  Public school
Ritalin prescriptions do not exist for the benefit of the prescribees.
Once there was a 7-year-old girl.  The schools of Charlotte, NC diagnosed
her as suffering from minimal brain dysfunction (MBD) and prescribed
Ritalin.  Instead, her parents sent her to a non-government school in

teaching in its place.  Within a few years, she could decline Latin nouns

It certainly doesn't require him to adopt any particular regulatory

          jokes and slurs.  Any text that elevates one race over
          another.
          Satanic/Cult:  Worship of the devil; affinity for evil,
          wickedness.  Sects or groups that potentially coerce
          individuals to grow, and keep, membership.
          Drugs/Drug Culture:  Topics dealing with the use of
          illegal drugs for entertainment.  This would exclude

          Gambling:  Of or relating to lotteries, casinos,
          betting, numbers games, on-line sports or financial
          betting including non-monetary dares.
          Questionable/Illegal:  Material or activities of a

the modern age with "incentive contracts"  (you produce a desired outcome, I
pay you).  This means that as time goes on many businesses approach closer
and closer to the one-man firm model in which everyone buys and sells
everyone else's services on the spot market.  This didn't work in the past
because of the friction of the transaction costs involved but those costs
have declined dramatically.  In this environment, others don't care how much
time you surf the web or what you encrypt as long as your output is of the

CDs sell for more because buyers decided that they wanted a wider range of
titles with shallower sales (hence higher unit costs) rather than a narrower
range of titles with lower sales prices.  The number of CD titles available
is far greater (in general distribution) than the number of vinyl titles
that were available during vinyl's peak year.  This greater availability of
short run pressings raises average unit sales costs justifying the higher
prices.  Had the market decided (when physical production costs fell) that
it was satisfied with a Top-40 CD stock, average CD prices would have fallen
to vinyl levels.
Materials cost is a minor part of total cost.
In both cases, the cost of production is a small part of the cost of goods

The original definition of multiple transactions (structuring) said the
transactions had to occur within one day.  There is now a separate rule that
says that the bank has to report *any* suspicious transactions even if they
don't fall under specific regulations.  Keep the population guessing as to
what's reportable.
New York money center banks allow $1000 a day or so.  Credit cards (which
are also bank accounts although most don't think of them as such) let more
get out and one can always over pay one's credit card to get a credit
balance of any amount.  They take the money.  Usually in those cases, you
can withdraw the credit limit each day and then when the account settles
overnight it draws down the credit balance you've built up and your
available credit is back.  Some may do this "live" one would have to
experiment.  ATM and credit cards may also have different limits for point-of-sale
transactions than for cash withdrawals.

If I read *one* more bit of blather about the "information haves and have
nots" I am going to take my Streetsweeper down to my local McDonalds and
decrease the imbalance between these two groups by reducing the quantity of
the latter.  It would work just as well as any other solution.
The latest blather was in a parting shot in David Kline's last "Market
Forces" column in Hot Wired (
"How can we assure that the tired, poor, huddled masses yearning to breathe
free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore, the homeless, and
tempest-tossed get onto the Net"? (My formulation -- not his.)
The answer is we can't.  I have been online every day since 1987 or so.
Since that time I have begged, pleaded, cajoled, and threatened friends,
relatives, casual acquaintances, and total strangers to get them on line.
(We are talking here about people who have the cash to easily get wired if
they care to.)  Sometimes it has worked.  Mostly it has not.  It has gotten
easier to dragoon people onto the net recently but it is still hard.  I have
taken to telling people who ask me for help setting up their computer
systems that I will only help them on the condition that they obtain an ISP
account and use it.
The usual reason for resistance (beyond a reluctance to spend money) is a
failure to appreciate the value of the online experience.  No matter how
much I plead, many people have not (in the past) been able to see what this
all was good for.  This was particularly true when online computing was a
text-only experience.  Non-readers have a problem with text.
Now, even though the net is more graphical, it still lacks appeal for 95% of
the population (or at least enough appeal to get them on to it).  Even
though we may know that many people could improve their lives and economic
standing by learning to compute and telecommunicate, they don't *know* it
and so they are not wired.  Par example -- an auto mechanic of my
acquaintance was assigned to the office where he worked to handle advanced
paper shuffling involving auto parts.  He started to use an XT to track
parts and got to like it.  He asked me for some advice and over the years
bought an XT and other machines until he now has two desktops and a laptop
networked at home.  He's on the net as well.  At work, he has become a
supervisor in part because he can use computers.  The original purchase of a
computer has been paid for many times over by increased income.
There is nothing new about this, of course.  Even without computers, it is
obvious that someone who can read and write can average more money in the
modern world than one who can't.  And yet many people refuse to learn to be
good readers.  Because they don't read, they also know less.  Sans books and
periodicals, you simply can't encounter a critical mass of ideas and
information sufficient to achieve a self-sustaining intellectual life and
the flexible abilities necessary to survive in the current economy.  For
readers, the modern economy is a piece of cake.  And reading is not a
"certification" it's a skill.  You can get it with minor help.  It takes no
money and it can't be denied to you by a racist society.  Without so much as
a high school diploma, a good reader can succeed easily in today's America
(credential-happy Europeans have to fend for themselves).
Do you doubt this.  Assume you are a good reader without credentials.  1)
Learn to type.  (Used manual portables cost $12 at the Sally Army.)  3)  Get
a temp job that requires typing.  (Lie about your high school diploma.
Since you are well dressed from the same Sally Army where you got your
typewriter and have excellent communication skills -- these things are under
your control -- it shouldn't be much trouble.)  2) Learn to word process.
(Commodore 64's and used b/w TV sets cost $25 or less at flea markets.
Running the tutorials at hourly PC rental places are pretty cheap as well.
If you are a good typist, temp agencies will cross train you on PCs so they
can rent your rear end out for more dough.) 4)  Become an experienced
(permanent) temp word processor on the night shift in the financial district
of NYC making $22.50-$27.00/hour.  ($18.00/hour -- days.)  5)  Then become a
(contract) tech writer and start to make more money.  All that is necessary for the above is the ability to read and write
fluently which is open to all persons of normal intelligence.  But most
choose not to learn those skills (which is why they pay so much in today's
market).  Similarly, most people are not interested in learning to compute
and in getting wired. Instead they stand around an bitch about how their
incomes are flat and they can't find work when they get laid off at 50.
Hardly surprising.  They've already established that they're dead from the
neck up.  I wouldn't hire them, why should anyone else.
This is the phenomenon of the modern world.  So many people one meets are
pig ignorant.  They are sitting under a waterfall of knowledge cascading
over them in a volume unprecedented in human history and yet they contrive
not to get wet.
Meanwhile, we are told that the information have-nots are being denied
access to the wonders of the information age.  I'm very sorry but they have
already rejected the wonders of the last information age that started 541
years ago with the publication of the Mazarin Bible.  People who can't even
bother to read and write will not be helped by our cash and Al Gore's
preaching.  You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him think.

Livingstone short of reading material"?

I forgot to include a little anecdote about education in my original post.
There seems to be a belief extant that education is something that you are
completely dependent on others for.  The masses will just sit there and melt
away unless they are given a "program."
"I need a program.  Who's got a program?  We need a program.  All God's
chillun's got programs."
This is provably false.  People can learn whatever they have to.  (Within
very broad intellectual limits.)  If they *choose* not to learn (and you are
not their parent or employer), it is a violation of their autonomy to
browbeat them.  You should leave them alone in their ignorance and, of
course, not waste any money helping them since they have demonstrated that
they aren't interested.  An economist might say that those who reject
education are making a choice.  They are deciding that, for them, the value
of today's leisure (L) plus today's income (I) is greater than the
recreational value of education (R) plus the present value (PV) of future
financial and psychic gains from education.
L + I > R + PV
In other words, all those people who were drinking beer or working
construction while TM was going to college, graduate school, studying
physics, and working for Intel were making the decision that *for them* the
value of all that time off, plus current income, plus lack of skull sweat
was greater than the chance of becoming a millionaire and retiring at
30-something.  And they may well be right.  In any case, we should honor
their choices as we expect them to honor ours.  To intervene in a big way in
their lives (or in TMs) to challenge their choices is deeply wrong.  We
can't tell from the outside what the value of the education/work/leisure
tradeoff is for an individual.  All we can do is observe their actions. If you doubt that people can learn if they really have to...
Greta spent her teens fleeing with he mother from Poland into the USSR on
foot in advance of the Wermacht (religious differences).  As the Wermacht
receeded, so did Greta and her mother who preferred the West.  In the course
of events, they ended up in a Displaced Persons (DP) camp in Austria.  There
was an understandable reluctance on the part of the DP to be repatriated to
areas in the Soviet Zone of Occupation.  (Operation Keelhaul would later
hand many thousands of DPs over to the commies.)  England or America were
*by far* the first choice.  A rumor went around the camp that England was
desperately short of glove makers.  Some people in the camp knew how to make
gloves.  Within a few weeks, everyone in the camp knew how to make gloves.
English lessons were also very popular.  There were no "programs" to teach
either of these skills.
The happy ending to the story is that Greta and her mother secured a trip to
New York City.  In the 45 years since she's been here, Greta has neither
returned to Europe or ever felt the desire to do so in spite of the superior
European social welfare systems.  When asked why, she says that Europe had
its shot at her and she doesn't believe in tempting fate.     The point is that people can learn if they have to and if they don't have to
they don't have to.  Life in America today is as easy as it's ever been in
human history (at least since the invention of agriculture), so if people
want to relax we should let them -- and not subsidize them.

Of course curfew laws only control the inarticulate and scruffy.  Well

can claim that they are out doing tons of protected things like work and

"Ossifer, I'm peaceably assembling to petition the government for redress of
grievances.  It's in the First Amendment.  You could read about it and

something to say.  Kids older than 15 or so can claim to be "emancipated
minors."  Parents can emancipate their children by signing a simple

And to bring things back somewhat to cypherpunk (or at least

other technical advances are bound to put a host of weapons in everyone's

by getting people used to the concept of self defense, small group defense,
and behaving oneself in public.  In fact, in 1995 the term to go "postal" entered the vocabulary.  As in the

E.  Conclusion
          Cutting through the acronyms and argot that littered
the hearing testimony, the Internet may fairly be regarded as a
never-ending worldwide conversation.  The Government may not,
through the CDA, interrupt that conversation.  As the most
participatory form of mass speech yet developed, the Internet
deserves the highest protection from governmental intrusion.
          True it is that many find some of the speech on the
Internet to be offensive, and amid the din of cyberspace many
hear discordant voices that they regard as indecent.  The absence
of governmental regulation of Internet content has unquestionably
produced a kind of chaos, but as one of plaintiffs' experts put
it with such resonance at the hearing:
               What achieved success was the very
               chaos that the Internet is.  The
               strength of the Internet is that
               chaos.[23]
Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so the strength of
our liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the
unfettered speech the First Amendment protects.
          For these reasons, I without hesitation hold that the
CDA is unconstitutional on its face.

CONVICTION OF TAX MAN'S KILLER GETS TOSSED OUT
By Gregg Birnbaum
Post Correspondent
ALBANY --- The state's top court yesterday threw out the murder conviction
of a Republica Party activist who gunned down the first IRS agent to die in
the line of duty.
The court of Appeals overturned the 1983 conviction of James Bradley, who
asked IRS collection agent Michael Dillon, "Mike are you prepared to meet
your maker?" --- then fired an M-1 rifle at him twice.
Bradley then knelt down to take Dillon's pulse and shot him a third time
before driving to a friend's house to present him with the weapon as a
Dillon 61, had gone to Bradley's house near Buffalo in September 1983 to
collect the last $332 of a $2,000 lien imposed by the IRS.
When Bradley wouldn't pay up right away, Dillon threatened to seize one of
his cars.  Bradley got his rifle, returned to the kitchen, where Dillon was
sitting and started firing.
In a unanimous unsigned ruling, the Court of Appeals said the trial judge
undermined Bradley's insanity defense by improperly allowing the jury to
also consider a first-degree manslaughter conviction.
That's the charge on which Bradley was convicted.  He was acquitted of
second-degree murder.
At his sentencing, Bradley predicted Dillon wouldn't be the last IRS agent
to die at the hands of an irate taxpayer and said, "I was just helping
President Bonzo get government off our backs," an apparent reference to
then-President Reagan.
The Erie County district attorney said he expected to resubmit the case to a
grand jury.  If Bradley is tried again, he will face a first-degree
manslaughter charge or lesser, his lawyer said.
Before the shooting, Bradley, 76, had long been known as a Republican
campaign worker in the Buffalo area.  He is now in the Mohawk Correctional
Facility in Rome and is said to be ill.

"Some groups advocate aggressive violence as a means of achieving social

So 90% of the population answer "No" and demonstrate that they are either

@_subject: Rating Problems 
The recent CDA decision pointed out some of the problems involved in rating
Net content.  For example, the court spent a lot of time talking about Cyber
Patrol software and the CyberNOT list "containing approximately 7000 sites
in twelve categories.  The software is designed to enable parents to
selectively block access to any or all of the twelve CyberNOT categories
simply by checking boxes in the Cyber Patrol Headquarters (the Cyber Patrol
program manager).  These
categories are:"
          Violence/Profanity:  Extreme cruelty, physical or
          emotional acts against any animal or person which are
          primarily intended to hurt or inflict pain.  Obscene
          words, phrases, and profanity defined as text that uses
          George Carlin's seven censored words more often than
          once every fifty messages or pages.
Violence against plants is OK, however.  Likewise Cypherpunks which probably
meets the 1 bad word per 50 messages standard.  I wonder if they use
Carlin's original or updated 7 Words.
          Partial Nudity:  Full or partial exposure of the human
          anatomy except when exposing genitalia.
          Nudity:  Any exposure of the human genitalia.
Only in pictures.  Text-only full-frontal nudity is OK.  Looks like baby
pictures are out though.
          Sexual Acts (graphic or text):  Pictures or text
          exposing anyone or anything involved in explicit sexual
          acts and lewd and lascivious behavior, including
          masturbation, copulation, pedophilia, intimacy and
          involving nude or partially nude people in
          heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian or homosexual
          encounters.  Also includes phone sex ads, dating
          services, adult personals, CD-ROM and videos.
Bestiality is not covered though.
          Gross Depictions (graphic or text):  Pictures or
          descriptive text of anyone or anything which are
          crudely vulgar, deficient in civility or behavior, or
          showing scatological impropriety.  Includes such
          depictions as maiming, bloody figures, indecent
          depiction of bodily functions.
There goes all of Pop Culture.  Certainly deficient in behavior.
          Racism/Ethnic Impropriety:  Prejudice or discrimination
          against any race or ethnic culture.  Ethnic or racist
          jokes and slurs.  Any text that elevates one race over
          another.
Luckily, all other forms of discrimination are OK.  Women, crips, queers,
Jews, and old folk watch out.  How politically incorrect of Cyber Patrol.           Satanic/Cult:  Worship of the devil; affinity for evil,
          wickedness.  Sects or groups that potentially coerce
          individuals to grow, and keep, membership.
Does that include evangelicals?  They're not Satanic but they certainly
encourage membership growth.  Some evangelicals can be quite coercive.  And
why Satanists?  Don't we have freedom of religion in this country?
Remember, the Supremes *did* throw out the Hialeah Sanitaria Animal
Sacrifice Ordinance.
          Drugs/Drug Culture:  Topics dealing with the use of
          illegal drugs for entertainment.  This would exclude
          current illegal drugs used for medicinal purposes
          (e.g., drugs used to treat victims of AIDS).  Includes
          substances used for other than their primary purpose to
          alter the individual's state of mind such as glue
          sniffing.
I'm glad my drug pages are limited to the non-entertaining uses of illegal
drugs.  Purely analgesic purposes only.
          Militant/Extremist:  Extremely aggressive and combative
          behaviors, radicalism, advocacy of extreme political
          measures.  Topics include extreme political groups that
          advocate violence as a means to achieve their goal.
There goes   They certainly "advocate violence as a means
to achieve their goal."  Pretty aggressive and combative as well.  Radical.
Advocate extreme political measures.
          Gambling:  Of or relating to lotteries, casinos,
          betting, numbers games, on-line sports or financial
          betting including non-monetary dares.
There goes   *All* financial betting.
          Questionable/Illegal:  Material or activities of a
          dubious nature which may be illegal in any or all
          jurisdictions, such as illegal business schemes, chain
          letters, software piracy, and copyright infringement.
Which jurisdictions -- Singapore?  Do they mean just US jurisdictions or all
jurisdictions.  Is offshore banking dubious?  It's not illegal.
          Alcohol, Beer & Wine:  Material pertaining to the sale
          or consumption of alcoholic beverages.  Also includes
          sites and information relating to tobacco products.

So all you have to do is copy the whole statement, delete the offending
passages, and mail it to your ISP as a counter offer to their proposed
contract.  You can explicitly disclaim the language you don't like.  This
sets up a long and interesting negotiation process during which you can try
to get them to define what they mean by the terms.  Since they haven't
defined any of this stuff (indecency?) it's all kind of meaningless.
Businesses usually won't cut you off over a mere refusal on your part to
accept a contract.  They wait for an overt act.
Might even work in the case of someone like me who pays AT&T $2K/month or more.
Then you can get a real ISP.

Bad Boys, Bad Boys
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do when they come for you? Bad Boys, Bad Boys
repeat endlessly.
We did 3) last Wednesday.  Here are some more points.
4)  There must be a you.
In order for the Bad Boys to come for you, you have to exist in a form that
can be "come for."  This is tricky in a world in which "processes" can be
spawned more cheaply and easily than guppies.
Students of military tactics know that the basic tactical reality is the
force ratio.  This can be looked at in two parts:  1) the ratio of attackers
to defenders (or rulers to ruled in the civilian world) and 2) the ratio of
soldiers/law enforcement personnel to space.  The lower the ratio, the less
effective the force will be.  As the Bad Boys confront cyberspace, they find
both types of force ratios turned against them.  As we discuss here, there
are more "defenders" to attack and as we shall see under point 5) below,
there is much more space to try to rule.
Before there was cyberspace, there were front companies.  In the wondrous
Anglo Saxon legal system; people, sole proprietorships, partnerships,
trusts, and corporations all have somewhat equal and independent legal
existence.  People, sole proprietorships, partnerships, and trusts can all
be created without securing permission from any authority.  They come into
existence by simple act of will.
In times past however, the creation and maintenance of these entities took a
bit of time.  In a practical sense, a person could only create an maintain a
limited number of such "legal persons."  The wonder of automation is that
the creation of entities becomes much easier and cheaper.  Software agents
are just one of the new sorts of entities that we are capable of creating.
There are also the effects of applying automation to traditional entities.
"Let a thousand trusts bloom."  In addition to entities created for business
purposes, the authorities will have to deal with entities created for
entertainment and charitable purposes.  This leads to a vast increase in the number of entities who act and who may
violate laws and who must, therefore, be subject to control by the Bad Boys
if they are to control things.  But it is much cheaper and easier to create
"legal persons" these days than it is to unravel them "pierce the corporate
veil(s)" and bring them under the control of "law."  If the permissions
aren't set right,  it will be very difficult for the authorities to pierce
the corporate veil of net-based legal persons.  Software processes are hard
to arrest and harder to coerce. Remember, as long as an entity pays its bills and meets its commercial
obligations, it can find a home and continue its "life."  Markets don't care
much what your nature is as long as they can buy from or sell to you.
Official status is not required.
In addition to the proliferation of entities, telecommunications lets each
of the traditional human actors do more of everything including those things
that regulators wish to regulate.  And by letting residents from everywhere
on earth into everyone's "home" market, telecoms multiplies the number of
potential law enforcement targets within popular jurisdiction.  As long as
jurisdictions are geographically bound, popular jurisdictions (like the US)
will find out that they have gained millions of new virtual
citizens/residents who must be ruled by US authorities (if that can be done).
But with more natural persons "entering" the jurisdiction, with the previous
natural residents doing lots more, and a swarm of new artificial persons,
the Bad Boys' resources are strained.   The more entities to "rule," the
less each entity (including natural persons) can be ruled.  [If you believe that the control technologies can be scaled up at the same

Voila.  I've just converted a discussion of explosives into protected

I consider it highly unlikely that people will be doing much time for
so-called explosive speech.  The publisher of Paladin Press *is* being sued
civilly in a case of a customer who read his "How to Kill" series a bit too

The reason that Vice Raids probably won't work too well in cyberspace is
because we are harder to intimidate.  There are lots of us, we are spread
all over the world, and we can so easily disguise ourselves.  Note the
ineffectiveness of the recent German crackdown.

The latest Wired and last week's news reports covered the FAA decision to
sloooowly move from the current Positive Control ATC system to one called
Free Flight in which aircraft pick there own routes and separation is
maintained by GPS, computers, and telecommunications.  Collision avoidance
telecoms as opposed to collision avoidance radar.  Every plane knows where
it is in 4 dimensions (don't forget time) and knows its performance
capabilities.  They communicate with each other and the ground to keep away
from each other.
The question is why?
Why abandon a central command and control system with defined airways and
checkpoints, orders and acknowledgements?  Is this some sinister triumph by
free market ideology creeping into the ATC system as it did into New
Zealand's Labour Government of the 1980s or even into the Chinese Commies
brains?  Not quite.
It is simple.  The system was breaking down already even before the 40-50%
traffic growth projected over the next few years.  Even if the FAA weren't
totally incompetent as a computer buyer, a centralized system suffers from
real congestion problems as growth occurs.  Trying to cram more traffic down
fixed routes is a real problem.  Likewise finding enough commanders to seize
and hold the high points of the ATCS.  The change has been proposed because
the system would collapse without it.  Freedom is their only chance.
Note the same effect in the future as trade, travel, data flows, etc. double
and redouble.  At some point on the growth curve, free flight becomes the
only possibility.

Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do when they come for you? Bad Boys, Bad Boys
repeat endlessly.
We did 4) two weeks ago.  Here are some more points.
5)  The Bad Boys must know where you are.
The general problem that Bad Boys face when policing cyberspace (and indeed
the whole modern marketplace) is that it is a "target poor" environment.  As
we saw in the last piece, the basic tactical reality is the force ratio that
can be applied to a territory.  How many bodies can you deploy per unit of
land to control it.  Even before you consider the size of the enemy force,
you have to consider the size of the territory.  This same calculus applies
equally to civilian law enforcement.
Another basic tactical problem is what von Clausewitz in "On War" called the
"fog of war."  This is the very great problem of knowing exactly where your
opponent is and what he is doing.
Note how computers can expand the "space" to be controlled.  Even before the
Internet became big, the problem can be seen in this excerpt from Sterling's
"Hacker Crackdown" (
"About twenty-five boards vanished into police custody in May 1990. As we
have seen, there are an estimated 30,000 boards in America today. If we
assume that one board in a hundred is up to no good with codes and cards
(which rather flatters the honesty of the board-using community), then that
would leave 2,975 outlaw boards untouched by Sundevil. Sundevil seized about
one tenth of one percent of all computer bulletin boards in America. Seen
objectively, this is something less than a comprehensive assault."
Today, 30,000 web sites are created each month or so.  Just logging them is
hard much less ruling them.
The fact is that cyberspace is so vast, that it is very hard to make much of
a dent in it.  Policing territory is hard enough when you can see most of
it.  Any city cop or soldier doing house-to-house fighting can tell you that
crowded cities are harder to police than open territory.  Cyberspace has the
topography of madness.  Much of it is invisible and it grows changes and
deforms with the speed of the thoughts of the millions of its "residents."
And it has a doubling rate much faster than the doubling rate of "policing
hours" available to the would-be authorities.
Aside from sheer size and crazy topography, cyberspace can be very hard to
penetrate.  We on this list are well aware of the tools of obfuscation:
cryptography, false identities, remailers, proxies, etc.  An even bigger
factor are the features of our world that we as sophisticated users don't
even think about.  The strange nature of the place is hard for outsiders to
grasp.  The "locals" always have the strategic advantage of familiarity with
a territory.  The speed of technological change is also problem as is the
speed of "movement" within the system.   Even if the opposition had the troopies to patrol the vast new territories
there are these frustrating "magical" qualities of cyberspace.  You block
one WWW site and its content in "teleported" within minutes to another site
half a world away.  You require your local ISPs to interpose a "Surfwatch"
interface between your captive citizenry and the free world and some of
those captives don the "invisible cape" of a proxy server to get at the
content they want.  Then there's the "force field" of crypto to block your
investigations.  None of these "magical" technologies are perfect they can
be defeated (sometimes) but defeating them takes resources.  And so far, the
Bad Boys haven't been winning too many in cyberspace.

In general, I think that we should attack government key escrow on economic
efficiency grounds by pointing out that it is unlikely that "socialized key
escrow" would do as good a job as private enterprise key escrow.  The
Stalinist method of industrial production, is well known for its
inefficiencies and similar inefficiencies attach to government key escrow.
In fact, I suppose that government operation of the identification system

It is not technologically feasibly to develop a pile of advanced
technologies that do not contain weapons or defenses of some kind.
Technology gives one the power to do things.  The power to "do things" is a
superset of the power to attack or defend (the power of weaponry).  A weapon
is basically an instrument for projecting force or (in the case of defenses)
blocking that projection.  As technology advances, more and more powerful
instrumentalities are placed in individual hands.
This is particularly the case with modern machines and markets.  Whereas
past practice involved mass production of identical products from very
specialized production machinery, the current trend is moving towards custom
products produced by "general" machines.  While it might be barely possible
in the mass production age to control weapons by blocking the flow of these
specific products (a Streetsweeper, say) into the marketplace, it will
clearly not be possible  in the age of custom production.  General machines
will be available to produce specialized products (often under the direct
control of the customer, himself).  Some of this custom production will be

Except that this only applies to official uses.  Obtaining a gain from a particular SS "account".  I don't think it applies if you lie to your employer.
No checksums involved (scheme invented in the '30s before that sort of thing) but there are unused ranges and geographical ranges.  Freeware program like ssn.exe (available in all the usual places) will let you vet numbers.
If you use a "wrong" SS# on a W-4 form you will (some of the time but not always) receive a computer generated note from the SS warning you that your earnings have not been deposited into the proper account and if you don't correct the error you may lose benefits.  Further action almost never occurs.  Obviously more of a problem if done on 1040 forms. In the case of a school or cable TV company or something that wants the SS# to use for ID or credit purposes, nothing bad is likely to happen even if you are "caught".  The SS doesn't verify SS for the credit agencies these days so they've had to build their own databases.
If caught by private parties, all you have to do is say, "the SS# is Mark of the Beast mentioned in Revelations.  It is part of a Satan-inspired One-World-Government Plot to establish *His* rule over the earth.  I will not abide it."
They leave you alone after that.  Civilians are remarkably easy to cow if you express strong opinions.

Almost real dialog from the Spring of 1996:
Parent: "My child has no SS# because (he/she) has lived overseas for (his/her) entire life."
College admissions bureau-rat:  "But how can (he/she) have a Passport without an SS
Parent: "That's our problem, not yours unless you've joined the State Department in the last 15 minutes."
Most SS# problems occur in cases where one interacts with official persons.  Since it is rarely necessary to interact with official persons, one can easily minimize these problems.  Don't return their phone calls to your voice mail.  Don't go to their offices.  Like Rumpole of the Baily with his letters from Inland Revenue, drop their notes into the circular file.  Don't ask, don't tell. Very little prison time has (yet) been served for SS# fraud.  This may change if the "Immigration in the National Interest Act of 1996" passes since it increases penalties for uttering false documents in some cases.  It doesn't apply to your interactions with your cable company.

It was understandable to be poor when all the world was poor.  It is understandable to be poor in those nations today that make the accumulation of wealth a crime for most people.  It is not understandable to be poor (for long) in the US where one can reliably get out of poverty simply by doing three simple things:
1) get a high school diploma
2) get married
3) get any job
Only about 2 tenths of 1% of those who satisfy those three requirements
incomes below the official poverty line.
Like most libertarians, I dislike the government.  I don't care what a person's income is.  When I was self-supporting on an income of $200 a month in 1979, I was below the poverty level for a single person myself.

The current Forbes has a good short article wrapping up the status of the
"taxpatriate" control movement in Congress.
The Health Care Bill that passed in August didn't include an Exit Tax as
previously reported.  What it did contain was a provision that states that
taxpatriates with a net worth of more than $500K who renounce their
citizenship will still be on the hook for ten years for income taxes on
their US source income.  This provision is easily dodged however by tax
planning techniques that assure that the individual involved has no US
source income.  Borrowing and trusts can be substituted for an income stream.
The second provision was in the immigration bill.  It subjects all those
who renounce their US citizenship (for any reason) to a visa requirement
for entry to the US.  State can then deny visas in cases where the expat is
a taxpat.  This applies to new citizens of those OECD countries that have
visa-free entry to the US.  How State will filter recent expats out of the
flow for special treatment is unclear, however.  Nation of birth is shown
on passports, so that might be able to be used.  This gimmick is also
easily dodged by entry into Canada or Mexico with a low profile border
crossing into the US.

Perfect privacy is very difficult to achieve but with practice, one can
learn (and teach one's children) much improved privacy.  The following
suggestions are not the most radical ones.  They represent things that you
can do at little cost or risk. Things you can do to teach your children to protect their privacy.
1)	Practice privacy yourself.  Children learn by example.
2)	Don't apply for an SS# for your child.
3)     Do apply for a passport for your child (without an SS# of course).
Use it as the foundation for an ID pack for your child because passport
apps don't contain much useful information on a person and can even be
obtained without a birth certificate when the child is an infant.
4)	Make up some facially valid SS numbers for future use using a freeware
program like ssn.exe.
5)	Teach your child to give your accommodation address and voice mail
number as his address and phone number whenever asked (just like you do --
you do do that, don't you).
6)	In descending order of importance: keep him out of government schools,
keep him out of private schools in your country of residence, home school
him.  (Government schools give the government a direct opening into
information about your family.  Handing a child over to the government
effectively ends any parental rights you might have while he is in school.
Additionally, he may never learn to read and write.)
7)	Introduce privacy concerns into your ideolect: Whenever you are driving
around and see a police car say "There's the Geheime Staatspolizei" and
explain who the "Home State Police" were.  8)	Play privacy games like:  Let's think of things we can say to people who
ask us why we're not in school."  "Let's think up some neat names to give
to people when we don't want them to give them our real name."  "Let's
practice giving random answers to the question 'What's your name, address,
and phone number.'"
9)	When driver's license time comes teach them how to get a license in
another state or country than their state of residence (and why this is
10)	Get them a secured credit card in their true name to add to their ID
pack.  If you like, you can get them one in a nom de guerre as well.
Secured credit cards are the best ID money can buy. (Because people think
they're ID but they're not).

Anyone who turns their children over to puiblic schools cannot be very
interested in privacy since public schools are the major pathway that
governments use to exert social controls on families.  In addition to all
the paperwork on and tracking of the children, public schools record and
track the families.  The various state child protective services agencies
use information derived from schools to control children and parents.  If
you are not on welfare and do not have your children in a government
school, you will almost never come to the attention of those authorities.
The "fine" for not listing your kids SS# on returns is minor ($50) and is
not usually assesed in any case.  You can still deduct them.  Also those
millions of parents who don't file their returns don't face the problem
It is very rare to have an SS# bounced back at you if you just make one up
which is valid on its face.  This applies to both schools and jobs.

One shouldn't be vocal to public employees in any case.  Avoid them.  If
you are going to be vocal use a non government forum.  Separate your
personal life from your political life.  It's not too hard to break most of
the pointers between your physical presence and your ideological presence.
Even though an investigator could find where I sleep at night, they would
have to actually expend the resources.  My neighbors and the local cops are
unlikely to make the connection because they and I move in very different
circles and I minimize my database presence.
In any case, those stupid enough to turn their children over to the
government deserve whatever happens to them.  Even if CPS never gets
involved, the damage they do to their kids may be irreversible.  My parents
weren't that stupid in 1956 when I started school and that was at a much
lower level of knowledge of the effects of government schools.  There is no
excuse today when we can see the damage all around us.
As I said earlier today, you can reduce your risk of CPS oppression to nil
by keeping your kids out of public schools and licensed day care.

Rush Limbaugh opined that most of the BS on the Nets would disappear if Net
IDs could be easily traced.  (He was observing not advocating.)
I know this isn't correct.  Most of those who post do so under their own or
easily traceable identities.  Most of what is posted is "as legal as church
on a Sunday" in any case.  Many posters are judgment proof student types as
well.  The net is the equivalent of barroom conversation or other casual
conversation between individuals.  The only difference is more people can
overhear.  In addition, speakers are likely to get a bit more rambunctious
because they are not in the physical presence of others and so are less
likely to be intimidated in monkey-troop fashion.  No deference need be
given to those higher on the pecking order because those primitive
responses are keyed to physical presence.
The Net is an approximation of a stream of consciousness since many posters
don't think before they post.  That's not illegal, however.  If the Fibbies
knew who posted the Friendly Fire message about TWA 800 (how many megabytes
of such messages have there actually been?), it would make no difference
since such claims are legal. The Net is just what you get when communications barriers and physical
intimidation are reduced.  It isn't even very "nasty, brutish, and short."
I've posted controversial opinions for years and have hardly been flamed
once.  All those reporters who get on the Nets and immediately get flamed
must either be hanging out in the wrong places or be pretty stupid in the
way they say things.

If you have a credit history you can have a credit record with or without
an SSN.  Millions of foreigners have credit histories without SSNs BTW.
Millions of people with wrong or false SSNs also have credit histories.
The SSA decided a few years ago not to let the credit reporting agencies
check the validity of the SSNs in their records with the SSNs in the SSA
Not if they are in America but those outside America will.  False SSN's may
work though falsifying mortgage applications (with a federally insured
bank) may be a crime.  Individuals can also grant mortgages however and are
free to do so without using an SSN.  Those states that don't require SSNs will of course.  Some (most?) states
that require SSNs don't validate them.  Canadian provinces don't require US
SSNs to issue licenses.
It's been so long since I bought from a dealer.  Do the current federal
forms have a place for SSN?  Lie, be self employed, or be employed by a foreign entity.  They won't be
able to verify until the new Instant Check Right to Work Verification
scheme that the Feds are testing breaks wide.  Then it's self-employment --
better for you in any case.
Some kinds.  Again, the numbers are rarely verified.  Over the years, I've only seen one number be bounced back and that was
submitted to a bank by a person who did not vet the number for facial
validity.  If one institution turns you down, go to another.
No problem (unless his fiance wants to run a credit check).  Even if the
marriage license app wants an SSN, just say you're a foreigner with no SSN.
 Foreigners can still marry in America.  Even if you also state on the same
form that you were born in the US, you could still be a foreigner who's
never really lived here.  "My father was the Canadian Ambassador at the time."
Still accomplished by unskilled labor totally without an SSN.  Put hands on wheel and foot on gas.  Trivial.  Lie or get a foreign
license.  UK licenses are good for decades.  A dozen states (or so) still
let you operate a motor vehicle sans public liability insurance BTW and
non-drivers, corporations, other entities, in fact anyone or anything can
own a car.  You can drive a car owned by something/someone else.
Lie.  Or get insurance from a nice Swiss company.
A lot less of that going around these days.  Giving a false SSN may or may
not be caught.  Large companies often do credit checks these days but you
will probably survive.  If you're working at a large company as a
contractor or temp of course, your small agency may not have checked you
out much.  You can satisfy the I9 form requirements for proving right to
work by flashing your passport BTW and you can still get a passport without
supplying an SSN (in spite of the law).
No problem.  The ICAO record format for the nice little machine readable
strip on passports *does* have space to place a National ID Number, but the
standards do not require that a nation issue a National ID Number and fill
that block.  The UK and the US and others have (so far) not done so.  The
US legislation (effective January 1988) that the Passport Office's
Application ask you for your SSN and forward info on refusenicks to the
Treasury Department for a possible $500 fine, specifically says that
failure to provide the number shall not be grounds for refusal by State to
issue a passport.  In practice, Treasury has not fined anyone. Lie, have a corporation or trust you control buy, buy overseas or via
Canada, etc.

they lost their monopolies.  Two days ago, the UK announced that they were

Just cleaning up old responses to old messages:
Sometimes I will see long articles on subpoenas, contempt of court, and
compelled testimony in which no one mentions the fact that the only
sanction used is a little bit of imprisonment (two years seems to be the
max).  That's for things you know.  Since software can be made harder to
compel than people, a properly configured system (sort of like a
spendthrift trust where you can't get at it when compelled) may allow you
to dodge sanctions entirely.
Once we get better at human programming, it should be possible to make our
nervous system a secure system that can't respond when coerced.  This can
already be done by conscious self programming in individuation.  I
certainly try to do that.
Studies of the effects of North Korean brainwashing on different types of
POWs showed a wide variability in susceptibility.  Likewise studies of
Moonie brainwashing.  Political "moderates" with little or no ideology find
it hard to resist coercion.  "You can't fight something with nothing."  In
Korea, the prisoners from Turkey, proved impossible to brainwash.  They had
a mental toughness, a tradition of self posession, and a tolerance for
physical discomfort that strengthened their defenses.  Most U.S. Moonie
recruits were from squishy liberal households (like Barbara Underwood of
the Moonie 5 trial).  I am not as physically tough as a Turkish soldier but I am certainly tough
ideologically.  In resisting coercion I use a form of "name magic" to
strengthen me and weaken the opposition.  If you can control the naming of
an act or a relation, you can dominate the situation even if you are in a
weaker position.  Thus when Moonie recruiters approached me at the No. 10 Monterey bus stop
in front of the California Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate Park in SF
with their usual "Hi sailor, new in town?" approach ("Are you from out of
town?  We live with a group of people.  Would you like to come to dinner?);
I responded "I'm not interested in the Reverend Moon."  They left me alone.
When confronting con artists, I usually name the general category name of
their cons:  "Spanish Prisoners," "Shell Game," "Bank Examiners Con," etc.
Naming works with the Geheime Staatspolizei as well.  "You can't park

I'm off straight science fiction these days because the real world is so

to like military SF though and now straight military fiction.  The problem with straight SF for me is that computers and networks have
changed the future so much that (in the words of the motto of the SF
Writer's Association) The Future Ain't What It Used to Be.  The science
fictional futures of my childhood are now dead as doornails.  And I can't
enjoy contemporary SF that doesn't include a healthy dose of computers and
networking.  Unfortunately,  Since I am involved in "defining" the future in the debates
over the effects of the technology, I also can't suspend disbelief and like
stories that come to radically different conclusions about that future than
I have.  This is not old fuddy duddyism (I hope) but arises because the
nature of society these days is such that the future has become much more
of a consensual act on all our parts and I consider it important to hold
fast to my vision of the future and push it so that it comes about.  This
doesn't encourage suspensions of disbelief.  Meanwhile there are plenty of
other things to read.  Not that I get to read that much fiction these days.

that the commentators (and perhaps the public) are guilty of speciesism,

Those who read this list or watch the news of the "Wired Curtain" that is

that government Denial of Service Attacks (GDOS) are a real threat.  The
GDOS theory holds that if government legislates or even threatens
litigation against the provision of a particular service, the providers of
the service will fold and the public will be unable to obtain the banned
In the case of the net this is the "Do Not <--'Enter" theory.  The
governments claim that by threat, deception, or nuclear weapons, they can
keep millions of us from hitting the <--'Enter key and thus transmitting
banned material.  That is a very fine control regime indeed.  (Original
meaning of 'fine' of course.)
If the governments had this GDOS power; this Do Not <--'Enter power, then

"Behind a Suburban Facade in Queens, A Teeming, Angry Urban Arithmetic" is
the annual NYT article on the spread of illegal apartments throughout the
Region.  From the humblest urban ghetto to the swankiest suburbs, denizens
of the TriState area are converting one- and two-family dwellings into two-
three- or four-family (and denser) dwellings.  These illegal apartments are
commonplace and illegal.  This has been true (and written about) for years.
 Here we have a physical service (apartment rental), difficult to hide, and
illegal which is offered by hundreds of thousands of property owners in
this area.
The GDOS theory holds that this can't happen.  "All they have to do is pass
a law."  Note that the GDOS theories that involve our activities say that
once the government passes a law, no one (or hardly anyone) will offer an
anonymous Net account, or an uncensored ISP connection, or an un IDed
financial account, or an uncensored news server, etc.  That all government
has to do is pass a law and all transactions will be carried out in rigid
conformity to its dictates.  I say nonsense.  If the government can't keep thousands of property owners
(with their physical property at risk) from offering it for rent illegally,
in an "open, notorious, and continuous" manner; then they aren't going to
be able to keep very many of us from hitting <--'Enter.

I agree with your analysis.  It certainly matches what I was taught in law
school.  The rhetorical point I was making however is that a *practical*
not constitutional right to privacy exists as long as your questioner
eschews torture.  I think it is useful to point out -- in response to
government types who assert that "there's no absolute right to privacy" --
that they have actually set aside a zone of privacy by their rejection of
torture as an interrogation technique.
What this does is to remind listeners that coerced speech has an unsavory
history and it turns the argument from one between absolute positions into
one in which we are just arguing which sanctions should be applied when.
"Note that many governments have officially given up rape and torture as
sanctions.  (These were once universal.)  All we have to do is get them to

"Offshore Asset Management
The advantages of offshore professional asset management are many; namely,
the assets can be invested in a hard currency, in a secure market, in a
secure location, and in an account which is tailored to the objectives of
the trust fund. Chapter 7 discusses issues of asset management. There are two mechanisms for offshore asset management. The simplest is a
straightforward asset management account, opened in an OECD country or a
tax haven. Most simple asset management accounts in OECD countries will be
liable to pay some tax on income earned; accounts in tax havens such as the
Channel Islands may therefore be more attractive. For example, an asset
agreement can be settled with an international bank in London for an
account held in the bank's Channel Island subsidiary. If this method is
unsuitable due to concerns of attachment, tax implications for the domestic
trust, or concerns of irrevocability of the assets, a two tier system might
be more appropriate. In a two-tier system, the domestic trust is a
tax-exempt entity and is the sole beneficiary of the offshore trust. The
offshore trust acts as the investment account and should also be tax exempt."

At CFP in '95 in SF, Esther expressed the view that there was a place on the
Net for an anonymous ghetto (my words not hers) where people could be
anonymous but that most of the net would involve traceability of
transactions so that people could be held accountable and that businesses
and individuals would want to know who they were dealing with for payment
and accountability reasons.
I am not stating her position well I'm sure but it was clear that she
thought that non-anonymity would be the rule not because it was mandated but
just because Net actors would want it that way.  A short quote would not
allow anyone to understand her full position.
If she believes that anonymity would be rejected voluntarily for practical
reasons then that is just a prediction of a market not a conclusion.  Most
on this list would have no objection to making a prediction though we might
disagree with it.
Just as Esther predicted that the net would end copyright, we might predict
that the net combined with immediate settlement payment systems might reduce

connection is as hard or as easy as establishing an encrypted tcp/ip tunnel
to defeat government control efforts.  For both these tasks, I am dependent
on software writers who know more than I do.  Since the software of the Net
is written by people not governments, the governments will find it hard to
hold "free users" down to a 5% or 10% figure.  The Net is nothing more than
the software that it runs on and we (not governments) write the software.
In addition, we are not imposing our ideology on Singapore.  If Singapore

Here are the gory details from the first MOTD last Saturday:
               The attacker is forging random source addresses on his
               packets, so there is no way to find his/her location. There
               is also no way to screen out those packets with a simple
               router filter.
               This is probably the most deadly type of denial-of-service
               attack possible. There is no easy or quick way of dealing
               with it. If it continues into Saturday we will start working
               on kernel modifications to try to absorb the damage
               (since there's absolutely no way to avoid it). This
               however will not be an easy job and it could take days to
               get done (and get done right).
               For those who are IP hackers, the problem is that we're
               being flooded with SYNs from random IP addresses on
               our smtp ports. We are getting on average 150 packets
               per second (50 per host).
               We are not the only site being attacked in this way. I
               know of one other site that is being attacked in an
               identical manner right now, and I know of three others
               that have been attacked in the last two weeks. I hope that
               this means that the attacker is merely playing malicious
               games, and will soon tire of molesting our site. If that is
               the case, mail will come back up as soon as the attack
               ends. But if the attacker is really interested in damaging
               Panix specifically, the attack may *never* stop and
               service won't be restored until we can write kernel
               modifications.
Since then the packet streams have hit almost all the ports for news, www,
telnet, etc.

Many people on this list and in the larger world focus on laws and
regulations and sometimes act as if that is the only way that the relative
rights and duties of governments and civilians are established.  In fact,
there is a lot of informal negotiation going on all the time.  This is
significant because an unenforced law isn't a law at all.
For example, you will not read anywhere that compulsory education laws have
been repealed -- but they have.  When the home schooling movement started in
the late 1970s, there were occasional harassment and prosecution of parents.
The home schoolers won some and lost some.  As time went on, the authorities
came to accept home schoolers so that at this point, legal problems are
rare.  Compulsory education has been effectively repealed by the actions of
refusenicks in both the subject population and the enforcement population.  This same process will occur more frequently in the future as libertarian
memes spread, government enforcement resources shrink, and people's vastly
different attitudes as to what should be legal and illegal make a monopoly
legal regime impossible to keep in place.
Note that unlicensed immigration is against the law.  Note that some
websites post material that others would like banned.  Maybe you can deport
a few or ban a few.  But how many?  If you have three million illegal aliens
or 3 million individual ISPs (people with high speed connections running
their own sites) you can't deport them or shut them down because it simply
takes too much time and too many enforcement resources.  The authorities
give up.  You get de facto open immigration and a de facto unregulated Net.
Coercion is expensive and slow.  Free exchange is cheap and fast.  That's
why free exchange wins in the long run.
It's not a victory without losses.  Some people are busted.  Some sites are
shut down.  You don't go into battle expecting zero casualties.  But what
counts in the end is who wins.  And we've got them outnumbered by far.

Health Systems model in the mid '60s they fell 20% (relative to us -- while

Canadian costs have risen at approx the same rate as ours.  Per cap expenditures on the uninsured in America are approximately the same
as on the insured.  As are average number of days in hospital, etc.  Most
of the uninsured just go to hospitals and don't pay.  States have various
methods of sharing this cost out.  Interestingly, even though government
expenditures here are 60% of the total, per cap government expenditures on
health care are higher here than in the UK under the Nattie Health.  Our system is much more expensive than it has to be because the

far and wide.  The dropping of the Jake Baker case got little publicity and I
even had another lawyer on one of the law lists say that he thought they
might try for another indictment.  I knew they'd never get anywhere.
In those very rare cases where you get a guaranteed government loss criminal
investigation/prosecution the party involved should verbally abuse the
government and point out their manifest pathetic weakness.  It is very rare
to be in that situation because the government won't usually back a loser.  I
urged Phil Z. to take an aggressive approach in his case but he felt
uncomfortable about the idea.  Perhaps as a "leftie" he granted the inherent

@_subject: Swedish Narcotics Police Demand Telephone Card Database 
This week's Economist has an article on how the Italian national phone system
is making lots of money marketing GSM phones fed by cards that can be bought
for cash.  It expands the market for such phones.
I mentioned a few weeks ago, that Omnitel (a new PCS operator in the NYC
vicinity is selling (and heavily promoting) its no contract, no credit check,
card fed phone.  The phones and cards (after you buy the phone cards, you
call in the cards to an operator to add credit to the account) are available
all over the area.  The phone costs $99 (after rebate).
Yesterday, as I was walking past a Radio Shack, I noticed that they are also
selling a competing card fed PCS phone with the contradictory name of
I love Capitalism.
It's easy to see why New York PCS operators would turn in this direction. They won expensive PCS franchises and have to spend big bucks to tower the
vicinity.  It would be nice for them if they could get an income stream to
help pay part of the interest.  But there's a problem.  Cellular providers
NYNEX/Bell Atlantic and AT&T are offering phones for $15/month which work
throughout the BOSWASH megaplex (and nationwide with roaming charges)
meanwhile the PCS vendors just cover NYC and Northern New Jersey.  They need
to offer something else.
The benefit of card fed phones to vendors is obvious.  Suddenly, the 20-40%
of the population that can't (or doesn't want to) qualify for a
credit-checked cellular account can just pony up the cash and walk out with
A real privacy benefit as well.  If the authorities can't keep anonymous
people from getting accounts in such a regulated industry, it is hard to
imagine how they expect to bar anonymous accounts in an unregulated system
like the Net.

"Decency, security, and liberty alike demand that government officials shall be subjected to the same rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen. In a government of laws, existence of the government will be imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. [Our government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example.] Crime is contagious. If the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy. To declare that in the administration of the criminal law the end justifies the means-to declare that the government may commit crimes in order to secure the conviction of a private criminal-would bring terrible retribution. Against that pernicious doctrine this court should resolutely set its face."

But the charges were minor stuff.  Under the Federal sentencing guidelines he wouldn't have gotten much if convicted.  And I think that he had a good defense to some of the charges.  Selective prosecution and no crime for example.  The collecting of the names and addresses of government employees is not clearly illegal.  In some cases, it is public information and he could argue that he intended to organize demonstrations against them.  It is also not clear how they found out about the stink bomb.  That could possibly have been challanged.  The charges were fuzzy and minor.  Those sorts of things make them easy for a strong advocate to ridicule in court.  Clearly a waste of the taxpayer's money.  Their nature smells of political prosecution.  Another line of defense.    He could have been aggressive and fought instead of wimping out.  Lots of people have faced much more serious crimes and won.  It's not like Jim had anything better to do.
In such cases, an aggressive show of strength of character is best.  Weakness invites oppression.  A rule that you - Tim - seem to follow in general too.

Don't worry.  If you were busted it would cause a real stink.  Remember Operation Sun Devil.  The Feds really lost it.  Aggressiveness doesn't just mean publicity.  It means strategy at trial as well.  They have to try you and that would be risky for them because we all have an easy First Amendment argument to hammer them with.  The List is defined by its expression and not by anything else so attacks on the list are ipso facto attacks on expression.
In fact, Ruby Ridge and Waco are why the Feds are tiptoeing around any similar "raids."  The publicity there really hurt them.  Their trial losses in the insider trading cases of the 1980's (they lost all but one case that went to trial) are why such prosecutions dropped off.  They prefer cases they can win.

Besides, as Bell & McVeigh found out free lawyers are worth what you pay them.  Most felons could do a better job in their own case (or at least no worse) than these two did.  Besides, if you have a lawyers, you are usually prevented from using some of the more creative defenses because a lawyer has too much to lose.
Note what happened with Kevorkian's lawyer the last time he and "Jack the Dripper" were in court.  This lawyer has over the years changed from being a lawyer to being a total partisan for his client.  After his opening statement a few months ago on the latest of the Good Doctor's prosecutions for assisted suicide, the judge granted a mistrial because the statement was so prejudicial.  The DA later announced that he would not refile because they couldn't stop the lawyer from doing the same thing again.  Anyone can do this sort of thing and get at least one mistrial but ordinarily a lawyer won't do it because it will cause him problems.
Jury nullification and aggressive attacks on the judge and the prosecutor are just a few of the defense strategies that a lawyer won't indulge in but a client proceeding in pro per is free to use.

Tim has never said that he was interested in robbing, ruling, or killing others apropos of nothing -- something governments do every day.  Tim has merely said that he reserves the right to use deadly force to defend himself and that he was not interested in helping other people just because they "need" his help.  He didn't say he *wouldn't* help.  He just said he does not believe he is *required* to care or *required* to help.  That is a morally superior position compared to those who insist on helping others at the point of a gun.

I'm reading "The Gift of Stern Angels" by Michael Moriarty.  It is a memoir of how one hour with Janet Reno in a Washington DC hotel in 1993 turned the star of Law and Order from a Clinton voter into a very independent libertarian, a black-listed Hollywood pariah, and an exile to Canada.
[No they were just talking.]
Moriarty, who had voted for Clinton in 1992, was invited to a meeting on television violence between the AG and TV execs in the Ulysses S. Grant Suite of the Willard Hotel on November 18th 1993.  The AG said that a show like "Murder She Wrote" even though it didn't show violence on screen was troubling because it dwelt on the instrumentalities of violence.
Following the meeting, Moriarty publicly attacked the Administration, was fired from Law and Order, was unable to work in Hollywood (save for one appearance in Courage Under Fire), got divorced, and fled to Halifax.  He had favored a ban on "assault rifles" but he now moved to Canada because he feared that if he stayed in the US he would feel compelled to take up the gun.  The book has tons of great free speech quotes.  "In 3,000 years of human history, no one has ever dared to come to the conclusion that the fight scenes in Romeo and Juliet provoked the death of Christopher Marlowe."
It's not published in the US.  I ordered mine from the Book Room (North America's oldest bookstore) in Halifax.  1-800-387-BOOK (2665).

Certainly, such a conclusion would be reasonable based upon this promotional description coupled with the singular character of Hit Man, which is so narrowly focused in its subject matter and presenta- tion as to be effectively targeted exclusively to criminals. In other words, despite the fact that Paladin may technically offer the book for sale to all comers, we are satisfied that a jury could, based upon Hit Man's seemingly exclusive purpose to assist murderers in the com- mission of murder, reasonably conclude that Paladin essentially dis- tributed Hit Man only to murderers and would-be murderers -- that its conduct was not, at least in law, different from that of a publisher (or anyone else) who delivered Hit Man to a specific person or group of persons whom the publisher knew to be interested in murder. And even Paladin effectively concedes that it could be liable were such a finding permissibly made. Paladin's Memorandum in Support of Summary Judgment at 33 n.24.
A conclusion that Paladin directed Hit Man to a discrete group rather than to the public at large would be supported, even if not established, by the evidence that Hit Man is not generally available or sold to the public from the bookshelves of local bookstores, but, rather, is obtainable as a practical matter only by catalogue.

I don't think that Singapore is a fabulous place to live but its total freedom is probably greater than Germany or France.  Our total freedom in the US is greater than Singapore's.
It has just been getting attacked by those who accept the greater freedom violations of many other countries including many of those in the EU.
Germans lack many speech and association rights.  Germany has asked the US to arrest and extradite Americans for speech crimes.  They have mandatory address registration with the government (as does Singapore).  On the other hand, Germans have very restrictive labor and commerce laws, high taxes, and other laws that Singapore doesn't have.  Germany has mandatory "certification" (licensing) for almost every job in the country.  Singapore has some of these sorts of restrictions too but because of its other economic freedoms, it is freer than Germany.
Germany steals 50% of GDP and blows it on cigareets and whiskey and wild, wild, women.  Singapore steals only 20% of GDP (and requires an additional 20% mandatory personally-owned retirement savings from salaries).  Singaporeans are thus freer to use their own money than Germans.  Singapore is unfree in many ways but freer than many other countries not usually attacked as tyrranies.

It should be obvious to those who have read my stuff over the years that I am not a fan of Singapore's government.  As an anarchist, that would be ridiculous in any case.  All that I ever said was that Singapore was freer than lots of other countries that don't get so much bad press.  I mentioned Germany and I could have mentioned France.
Liberty is commutative as is tyrrany.  You can add up the restrictions and arrive at a total.  You can't analyze a human institution with mathematical perfection but you can do better than relying purely on emotional stereotypes.  I think that many of us ("We Are All Liberals Now" -- The Economist, 1997) ignore economic liberty when comparing regimes.  It was this failing in the Freedom House ( survey "Freedom in the World" ( published since 1981 that led to two competing surveys being published by CATO and Heritage Foundation (as mentioned in an earlier post).  Freedom House then retaliated with "World Survey of Economic Freedom" ( which is vague (both Germans and Americans are assigned equal "right to earn a living" scores of 3 even though Germans are much more restricted in that endeavor than Americans).  Their survey also totally ignores the "takings issue".  A country with a 100% income tax could rank perfectly on their scales.  There are bound to be differences of opinion about living conditions in different countries and different weights that individuals would assign to different factors.  I was never trying to convince anyone that Singapore is a capitalist paradise and everyone should emulate them.  In fact Hong Kong has had a better growth rate recently and was a nicer place to live prior to its late unpleasantness.
Personally, I prefer Europe's winner in the economic liberty sweepstakes -- Switzerland -- or the anarchist paradise where they have many laws but no one obeys them -- Northern Italy -- or the US where it remains easy to avoid most of the unpleasant restrictions that our rulers attempt to impose on us.

What is the significance of a legal decision involving 15-year-old software?  But Bill didn't do that.  He signed the Consent Decree.  He thought that if one pays the Danegeld the Dane will stop bothering you.  It doesn't work that way.  You sign an AntiTrust consent decree and you have the Feds beating you over the head with it for years.  [Ask the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company which signed one in the 50's and almost ceased trading.]
Don't deal.  Litigate.  Much cheaper.

That would be "renounced" his US citizenship.  Since he is a UK *resident* as well as a UK *citizen* his move won't save much in the way of taxes unless the bulk of his assets are in offshore trusts which have been treated more leniently in the UK than in the US.

Paul Getty realises his dream: a British passport By James Hardy, Home Affairs Editor
J PAUL Getty II, the billionaire philanthropist, has sealed his love affair with Britain by taking out UK citizenship after 25 years' residence in this The heir to what was once the world's largest private oil fortune received his British passport in the week before Christmas and immediately revoked his US nationality, The Telegraph has learned. Mr Getty, 65, who rarely gives interviews, is understood to be delighted at the alacrity with which his application was processed by the Home Office. The American Government is, by contrast, thought to be very disappointed with the development. Typically, Mr Getty has chosen not to publicise his change of status.
The adoption of British nationality will automatically attract the close attention of the Inland Revenue but friends claimed last night the prospect of a major increase in his tax bill did not deter him from seeking citizenship. They said his well known affection for the British way of life was the overriding factor in his decision. "Paul has given so much to this country over the years. It is wonderful that the country has given something back to him. I have no idea why he waited until now to apply," said one The son of John Paul Getty , formerly the world's richest man, J Paul Getty II has become one of the greatest benefactors the country has ever known. His fortune has been estimated at more than �1 billion and he is believed to have given away more than �120 million to deserving causes in Britain. He gave �50 million to the National Gallery, �20 million to the British Film Institute and a substantial donation to the building of the Mound Stand at Lord's cricket ground.
Thousands of smaller donations, often anonymous, have helped charity appeals or raised money for causes ranging from the Special Air Service to religious institutions. Friends say that Mr Getty has found a happiness in Britain that eluded him for much of his early life. His generosity to British institutions was recognised with the award of an honorary knighthood in 1986.
Mr Getty retains a flat adjoining the Ritz Hotel in London but spends most of his time at his 2,500 acre country estate at Wormsley, Bucks. He moved to Britain permanently the year after the death of his second wife, Tabitha Pol, from an accidental drugs overdose in Rome in 1971. In 1994, he married Victoria Holdsworth, a long-time British friend. She is widely credited with his gradual re-emergence into public life after years when he was rarely UK News Electronic Telegraph Monday 29 December 1997

Citizenship may give Getty his knight's title By Sandra Barwick
J PAUL Getty II, the American billionaire who has given millions to charities in this country, is likely to be able to use the title "Sir" after being made a British citizen.
Mr Getty's generosity to British charities was recognised in 1986 when he was awarded a KBE, or honorary knighthood, a title he was unable to use because he was not a British citizen.
But with the Christmas gift of citizenship, which Home Office sources confirmed was granted a week before the holiday, Mr Getty may in future be formally accepted as Sir Paul and his wife as Lady Getty.
A 10 Downing Street spokesman said she understood that a recommendation could be made to the Queen that the title be formally granted and announced in such cases. But Buckingham Palace was unable to comment yesterday.
Other non-British holders of the KBE include Bob Geldof, who is an Irish citizen. Mr Getty's accession to citizenship since the honour was awarded is unusual, but not unprecedented.
The present Lord Menuhin was made an honorary KBE in 1965 in the same way, but became Sir Yehudi Menuhin after he took British nationality in 1985. He was later made a life peer.
Heir to what was once the world's largest private oil fortune, Mr Getty, 65, has a flat in central London and a 2,500-acre estate at Wormsley, Bucks. He is reported to have revoked his US nationality. His affection for Britain is well known and friends say he found a happiness here that eluded him for much of his earlier life. Son of John Paul Getty, the richest man in the world in his day, J Paul Getty II is one of Britain's greatest benefactors.
With an estimated fortune of �1 billion, he has given donations thought to total more than �120 million to causes including the National Gallery (�50 million) and the British Film Institute (�20 million). Mr Getty, a cricket enthusiast, also made a substantial donation towards the building of the Mount Stand at Lord's, along with thousands of smaller gifts, often anonymously, to causes ranging from the SAS to religious institutions.
Three years ago he married Victoria Holdsworth, a British friend widely credited with his gradual re-emergence into public life after years when he was rarely seen. He moved to Britain permanently in 1972, a year after the death of Talitha Pol, his second wife, from an accidental drugs overdose in

Leaders of I.R.S. Panel Urge Sweeping Overhaul of Agency
By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON
The IRS had publicly defended its management of computer modernization until Thursday, when Arthur A. Gross, who was hired last year as an assistant commissioner of the agency to rescue the effort, told the restructuring commission that the new systems being developed "do not work in the real world."
Gross also said the IRS lacked the "intellectual capital" to modernize.
["intellectual capital" = brains]
Kerrey said that although the modernization project was bigger than any corporate computer system the government would have a hard time hiring the necessary talent to manage the project. "The market is bidding up the price for people who have these skills, and we just can't dole out big salaries," he said.
Executives who oversee information systems make as much as $378,000 in salary and bonuses, according to William M. Mercer, the nation's largest pay consulting firm. That is more than twice the highest federal salary and bonus, and corporate information executives typically also get options and other incentive payments.
Translation - since the Feds can't afford to pay CIOs what they're worth, and
governments don't offer stock options, they can't get the talent they need
to keep up with the market.  We are talking about senior management here.
If they try and respond by contracting senior management out, eventually the
institution disappears as a government institution.

Mule Power Used to Install Fiber-Optic Cable February 10, 1997
11.54 a.m. (1654 GMT)
SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- No manner of modern mechanical technology could
get over or around the rugged terrain confronting electricians trying to install
fiber optic cable through the Ozarks. So they shifted their sights from high-tech to low-tech and hired Festus, Jake,
Red and I.B. -- four Missouri mules -- to string 40 miles of cable through
southwestern Missouri. "Today's thought is `fast and done quick and make the big money,"' said mule
skinner James King, who works the mules for B&L Electrical Contractors. "A
lot of people have forgot the fastest way to get through the country is on a
mule or a horse." Even through city traffic, the mules are getting the job done. The idea first came about when Empire District Electric Co. was looking for
contractors to install fiber optic cable. The cable was to run along the path of a
power line strung in 1912. More than 80 years later, it was deemed
inaccessible to vehicles in most places because of steep hills, trees or other
impediments, such as chain-link fences. B&L submitted a bid based on doing the work with mules. The estimate was
tricky since the company had never used mules. And if they couldn't do the
job, a backup plan would have cost much more. "This is extremely rugged terrain. You couldn't get any motorized vehicles in
there," said Clint Lam, manager of B&L. "You could build a road through
there, but cost-wise, it would be so expensive." Empire didn't know the estimate was based on mule power. But when they
learned of the idea, it seemed logical, said Darrell Wilson, Empire's
telecommunications foreman. He told colleagues at a recent training seminar
about the mules' success. "Everybody thought I was joking," Wilson said. "They thought I meant an
ATV, some mechanical 4-wheel drive. They didn't really think it was a
four-legged animal. They were a little surprised when I said, `No, I mean a real
mule."' The mule skinners hook one end of the cable to an overhead pole and knot the
other end to a mule's saddle. Then the animal pulls. All-terrain vehicles are prone to tipping on uneven surfaces, while mules are
sure-footed and can jump creeks or chain-link fences. In fact, they worked so
well in the rough stuff, they were kept on even when the line reached
Springfield, the state's third-largest metropolitan area. "I think we're going to try to vote in a new position in our contract for mule
skinner," crew foreman John Agee joked. Dr. Melvin Bradley, of Columbia, a retired University of Missouri professor
and an expert on mules, was not surprised to learn of the mules' success. "The mule will go places, over banks and rough terrain and stand up and be
able to pull that cable through where horses will have trouble," he said. Festus, at 1,250 pounds the largest of the crew, drew curious glances from
motorists as he and skinner King recently hauled cable through exhaust-stained
snowbanks near a busy city intersection. Festus wasn't fazed, though he was a
bit trailer-sick from the 30-mile commute from Galena. "This is his first day on the job," the hard-hatted King said from the saddle
where he wraps the rope or cable being pulled by the mule. Festus can tow up
to 14,000 feet of cable, a load weighing more than 1 ton. Some people who saw the mules at work didn't know exactly what they were,
which King found remarkable. After all, mules were made Missouri's state
animal in 1995. "`Look, ma -- it's a horse!"' King said, mimicking what he's heard from
children passing the work crew. "It's a good old Missouri mule."

The traditional method of controlling the amount of power delivered to an electric traction motor was to run the juice through a resistor array.  As the motorman moved the controller up and down, the current would pass through fewer and more banks on the grid of resistors and the amount delivered to the motors would change.  Well you might guess that at 600 V DC and I don't know how many Watts, those resistor grids had to dump a lot of heat.

We don't know if this is true because no statistical series captures all "wealth."  The underground economy here is supposedly 15% but higher in much of Europe.  Also no country includes public benefits in income calculations although they are income and the higher US medical costs substantially increase the total income of those receiving Medicaid.  Those comparisons are suspect because too much income is excluded from the calcs.
They don't.  They own more "securities."  If you total the discounted (present) value of the future income stream of 20% of the earth's population (adjusting for the probable massive income increases of the next 20 years of extreme boom times), and you count the value of personal property it comes to more than the current wealth of the top billionaires who after all are apparently worth less than a $trillion or two collectively.
But I don't know what this all has to do with encryption policy, however.

Item in Tax Bill Poses a Threat to Job Benefits
By STEVEN GREENHOUSE
In Congress and in thousands of workplaces, the nation's business community is seeking to change longstanding rules and practices to turn many people classified as employees into independent contractors -- a move that could cause many Americans to lose health insurance and pension and unemployment insurance benefits.
In a little-noticed provision in its tax bill, the House of Representatives has approved a new -- and, many experts say, more inclusive -- test to determine who is an independent contractor. The Clinton administration is fighting the provision, asserting that it would strip millions of workers of their basic benefits. But business groups say the legislation is needed to clarify the often fuzzy definition of who is an independent contractor.
Outside Capitol Hill, employers ranging from small construction companies to giants like Microsoft and Pacific Bell are increasingly hiring new workers as independent contractors rather than as traditional employees -- a not entirely new practice that is expanding rapidly as employers strain to cut Such a strategy not only gives employers more flexibility to shrink their work forces, but it saves them thousands of dollars per worker because companies do not have to make Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance or workers' compensation contributions for independent contractors.
"What's clear is employers are seeking increasingly to have more flexible arrangements," said Sara Horowitz, the executive director of Working Today, an advocacy group on workplace issues. "But what that means in reality is people are working increasingly without benefits. They're working not only without health coverage but without the protections of the major labor legislation of this century: pensions, minimum wage, occupational safety, unemployment insurance, age discrimination. The list goes on."
Opponents of this practice say companies are wrongly lumping people usually considered employees, like truck drivers and middle-level managers, into the independent contractor category, which traditionally referred to people in business for themselves.
At last year's Olympic Games in Atlanta, for example, several hundred broadcast technicians hired by the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games had to sign contracts saying they were freelance independent contractors rather than employees, who are protected by overtime and unemployment insurance laws.
A Maryland catering company that books 1,000 events a year insists that the 75 waiters it hires on average for each event are independent contractors, not employees.
Texas A&M University recently hired 400 low-wage farm workers for its 18 agricultural extension programs and classified them as independent contractors rather than employees -- a move the IRS found to be illegal.
Pacific Bell laid off hundreds of experienced middle managers several years ago and has hired many of them back as independent contractors, but without the health insurance, pension plan and unemployment coverage they used to Corporate America defends the trend toward hiring independent contractors, saying it gives companies the flexibility to cut back easily during downturns. Business groups also assert that because this is an age when Americans are becoming more entrepreneurial and are increasingly working at home thanks to computers, it only makes sense to classify more workers as The corporate groups that have persuaded the House and are pushing the Senate to rewrite the definition of who is an independent contractor contend that the legislation is needed because the common-law definition is arcane and vague. They say that because many companies fear harsh IRS punishment, existing law pushes employers to classify workers as employees when they should be considered independent contractors.
Nelson Litterst, manager of legislative affairs for the National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business group that is pushing hard for the legislation, said: "The interest of small business has never been to find loopholes in the law to create wholesale switches of workers to independent contractors. Our intention is to clarify the definition so there is less of a gray area."
But a senior Treasury Department official argued that the provision passed by the House appeared intended to greatly increase the number of independent contractors, currently 8.3 million.
"The number of employees who will be shifted will be in the millions," said the official, who characterized the House legislation as far broader than traditional definitions of independent contractor. "I'm not even sure if I would characterize this provision as a sieve. A sieve at least strains things Martin Regalia, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, interprets the House language far more restrictively, saying it merely defines borders instead of opening up new territory. "To allege there will be wholesale expansion of independent contractors and that thousands of individuals will lose their benefits is pure rhetoric," he said.
The AFL-CIO is working to torpedo the House provision on independent contractors, insisting that it would eliminate basic protections for millions of workers, creating a cost advantage for many employers that would in turn push their competitors to transform their workers into independent That trend is especially worrisome for organized labor, which is struggling to increase its ebbing numbers, because independent contractors are not allowed to form or join unions under federal labor law.
"What you have here is another window into the Republican leadership's view of the role of government," said Peggy Taylor, the labor federation's director of legislative affairs. "In this instance, they're trying to put government on the side of those corporations and employers who want to get away from any responsibilities for the people who work for them."
Because the House included the independent contractor provision in its tax bill, but the Senate inserted no such language in its tax bill, administration officials and members of Congress say it is hard to predict whether conferees will keep the provision in the final tax bill.
The House language, introduced by Rep. Jon Christensen, R-Neb., sets up three tests to determine who is an independent contractor:
First, there should be a written contract between the worker and the company.
Second, the worker has a principal place of business that is not the company's, does not work primarily at the company's place of business or rents an office at the company. An alternative second test is whether the worker is not required to work exclusively for the company and whether the worker performed a significant amount of work for other companies the previous year.
If a worker meets the first and second tests, satisfying any of the following criteria makes a worker an independent contractor: The worker has "a significant investment in assets and/or training," the worker is primarily paid on commission, the worker has significant unreimbursed expenses or the worker's service is for a specific amount of time to complete a specific Regalia, the Chamber of Commerce economist, said these criteria would create far more certainty than the common-law test, which turns on whether the employer controls not just the results of a worker's service but the means a worker uses, such as the route a worker drives or how a worker dresses.
But analyses prepared by the Clinton administration and the AFL-CIO indicate that the new test will sweep many more workers into the independent contractor category. Pizza deliverers could easily become independent contractors because they do not work primarily on their company's place of business, they own their cars (a significant investment in assets), and they obtain most earnings from tips (primarily paid by commissions).
Similarly, carpenters and painters might overwhelmingly be considered independent contractors because they own their tools (a significant investment in assets), they do no work on their company's premises and they might sign a contract to do a specific job over a specific period.
According to the Treasury, many secretaries could become independent contractors if companies pay them a little extra and then require them to buy their own computers and pay a modest rent for their offices.
Business groups criticize these analyses as ludicrous, insisting that corporations will not do wholesale reclassifications of traditional employees into contractors.
The AFL-CIO is leading the campaign to kill the provision in conference, arguing that when employees are turned into independent contractors, society at large will often have to foot the bill for those without health insurance or pensions. .
Organized labor and businesses are fighting about independent contractors in another forum: the National Labor Relations Board. There, they are disputing whether truck drivers for the Roadway Package System and for Dial-a-Mattress should be considered independent contractors.
If the board does not find them to be employees, that will be a huge setback to organized labor because independent contractors do not have the protections of the National Labor Relations Act to form unions and bargain "We're heading into a two-tiered economy," said Ms. Horowitz of Working Today, the advocacy group. "The first tier has a New Deal safety net, protected by all the different labor laws. Then there is a second tier that's short term, flexible, many of them independent contractors. That tier doesn't receive benefits or labor law protections.
"The labor law and social protections are completely out of sync with this work force. If the rules of the game are changing and people are going to become independent contractors, then we have to have a new safety net that serves these people, too."

He had a perfect chance to rake the Feds over the coals and try nasty disfavored defenses like Selective Prosecution.  Hard to win that one but he had as good a case as any one I've seen for that defense.  At the most, he would have gotten a short sentence if convicted.  Big deal.  Since he was apparently not doing a great deal with his life in any case, he could have used it for some good.

In these political cases where the Feds are clearly overreaching, those who don't plead do much better than those who do.  This is the reverse of the situation in normal criminal cases.
Look at those in the Operation Sun Devil cases who plead vs. those who fought.

@_subject: Why Privacy 
Here's one of my old essays that I found while doing disk cleanup:
WHY PRIVACY?
The last few years have been bad ones for privacy in America.  As of June
1st, 1987 it became a crime to hire anyone, even your own child, who does not present identification cards.  The "drug" laws passed in recent years require ever more detailed reporting of smaller and smaller cash transactions.  Any children over the age of two who are to be claimed as dependents on their parent's tax returns now need Social Security numbers.  I suppose that with all this new prying there will be less illegal drug use and everyone will pay their fair share of taxes although past restrictions on privacy did not seem to reduce these problems.
We seem headed for a National Identity Card system.  According to government officials promoting ID cards, the main argument in favor of this radical step is that the law-abiding would have nothing to fear from it.  This seems a curious argument for the proponents of such a dramatic change in the relationship between the people of the U.S. and their government since it fails to state any benefit for the law-abiding either.
The fact is that the argument is false.  The law-abiding have a great deal to fear from all invasions of their privacy by the minions of the state.  If the history of this century has proved anything, it has proved that the innocent have far more to fear from government than the guilty.
Why guard the privacy of the innocent (the guilty can and will take care of themselves)?  After all the enforcers say, "If you have nothing to hide, you don't need privacy."  The answer should be obvious,  "The innocent won't know what they have to hide until it's too late."
The reason to value privacy is simply that we know from the most casual reading of the history of Europe that every sort of person has at certain times and in certain places been killed because of what others knew about them.  Over the last 400 years, within the confines of Europe, peasants, workers, aristocrats, bourgeois shopkeepers, Jews, Protestants, Catholics, Communists, Nazis, anarchists, monarchists, and others have faced death
simply because of what they were.  These people may have gone about their business
in seeming safety for years until a change in circumstance marked them for
death.  By then it was too late for them to hide their selves. This is why privacy must be valued.  It may be that every single one of the millions of current employees of the international, national, state, and
local governments who will make use of the information collected about us is a
noble human being without a tyrannical bone in his (or her) body but we cannot guarantee the future.  The average American has some forty years of life left and forty years is a long time in the life of today's nations.  There may
come a time within those forty years when innocent information surrendered to the state will mean death.  No nation is immune to domestic or foreign tyrrany, given the fluid nature of modern politics.
To make the abstract concrete, how was it that the Nazi government of Germany identified Jews for extermination?  It proved to be a simple matter of consulting local records.  Did the Jewish mother and father in 1880 or 1900
or 1920 realize when they listed their child's religion on birth records in full compliance with the law that they were condemning that child to death?  Or what about the passport.  Promoted at the beginning of this century as a
means of easing international travel and safeguarding the passage rights of neutrals, it has become a major impediment to international travel and even a threat to life.  If one is on board an airliner with armed Palestinian terrorists, would one rather be carrying an American, Israeli, British,
Swiss, or Syrian passport?

We're talking here about governments where unlicensed crypto is a crime.  Or other countries where anonymity is illegal.  Give me a break.
And EPIC (nee CPSR) and CD&T are run by Left pro-government types who like
big governments and high taxes.  So we're even.
So are they going to give up their street cameras, address registration (in Belgium, you can't get the gas service turned on in your flat if you haven't registered with the commune -- but you can get electricity), occupational licensure (of *all* occupations as in Germany), national ID cards, Financial Police (Italy), computer registration, piles of mandatory paperwork, etc.?
They could just repeal their privacy invading laws and regs.  No new technology needed.
And with modern technology, we turn right around and make decisions on the
rights of governments.
Then why do Europeans have *much* less privacy than Americans.  Tiny
example.  In much of Europe, if mail coming to your flat is not addressed to the name
on the mailbox, it doesn't get delivered.  In the U.S., the P.O. still tends to deliver as addressed and let the occupants sort it out.  Somewhat looser.

Rewinding Waco
New doc Waco turns heads, hearts. By Susan Gerhard
"I've always voted Democrat," William Gazecki, director of crowd-displeaser Waco: The Rules of Engagement, told me over the phone last week. "But at this point, all the lines are crossing in my mind."
Ours, too. One of the most achingly sad documentaries I can remember, Gazecki's film sounds, on paper, more like a morning with Rush Limbaugh than like an evening screening at the Roxie (where it got its first theatrical run, last week). In Waco's world the gun "nuts" are sane, the conservatives are honest, the liberals are pigs, the children are in danger. The doc left even slackers in Roxie's rep house stunned, their ideologies scrambled and their consciences scarred by a slow-motion,two-hour-plus replay of the slaughter of a peaceful sect.
How can a jury look at the Rodney King videotape and not see a police beating? The same way the American people can look at the Waco inferno and see a mass A radical reframing suited up in pin-striped documentary garb, The Rules of Engagement mixes footage that's already been heavily digested by interested parties: Waco in flames, forward- looking infrared (FLIR) imagery seen by Congress, CSPAN's coverage of the Waco hearings, David Koresh's pleas, Janet Reno's testimony. But this film adds to that tabloid mix some desperate 911 calls by Branch Davidians, sections of the negotiation tapes that offer a dismal perspective on FBI attempts to come to a truce, the Davidians' footage and that of the FBI agents (a SWAT teamster jokes about being "honed to kill," while Davidians inside calmly express fear for their lives). Most crucially, the soundtrack lays new emotional cues over old footage (a Third Reichian drumbeat as federal agents approach, heavy-metal guitar tangle as tanks crash into the building). And in case anyone's sympathy for the Davidians was lagging, the film also has witnesses noting that armed federal agents killed their Alaskan malamute.

Court Nixes Internet Smut Provision
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress violated free-speech rights when it tried to curb smut on the Internet, the Supreme Court ruled today. In its first venture into cyberspace law, the court invalidated a key provision of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.
Congress' effort to protect children from sexually explicit material goes too far because it also would keep such material from adults who have a right to see it, the justices unanimously said.
The law made it a crime to put adult-oriented material online where children can find it. The measure has never taken effect because it was blocked last year by a three-judge court in Philadelphia.
``We agree with the three-judge district court that the statute abridges the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment,'' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court.
``The (Communications Decency Act) is a content-based regulation of speech,'' he wrote. ``The vagueness of such a regulation raises special First Amendment concerns because of its obvious chilling effect on free speech.''
``As a matter of constitutional tradition ... we presume that governmental regulation of the content of speech is more likely to interfere with the free exchange of ideas than to encourage it,'' Stevens wrote.
Sexually explicit words and pictures are protected by the Constitution's First Amendment if they are deemed indecent but not obscene.

@_subject: Banking Secrecy and Nazi Gold 
- From some of my recent writing on the subject:
Nazi Gold, Jewish Accounts In the last year, Switzerland has been suffering from a series of attacks on
its record during and since the Second World War.  These articles, TV
stories, U.S. Congressional hearings, and lawsuits deal with two basic
issues.  First, that the Swiss accepted Nazi gold and deposits and performed
various financial services for the Nazi government; and second, that Swiss
banks have kept the dormant accounts of Jewish Holocaust victims and they
have refused to give these funds to their heirs.
There are several important things to note before discussing specifics.
First, many of Switzerland�s critics are bitterly opposed to the Swiss
tradition of bank secrecy.  They do not care about the desires of those Swiss
bank customers who like secrecy and they are using these complaints as a
means of attacking bank secrecy.  They would be attacking Switzerland with or
without the specific issues.
Second, these controversies are not new.  The issue of Nazi gold was debated
at length after the war in a dispute between Switzerland and the Allied
Third, these two controversies are separate.  The Nazi Gold question concerns
the fact that Swiss banks performed financial services for the German
government and private individuals from Germany during the war.
Some of this money may have been stolen by the Germans.
The Jewish accounts question has to do with the problems some heirs of
holocaust victims have had in obtaining family money they believe to have
been deposited in Swiss Banks before the war.
a) The Critics Some of the recent critics of Swiss banking come to the table with "unclean
hands."  US politicians and bureaucrats hate Swiss banks and bank secrecy in
Their motives in this matter are not altruistic.  They want to eliminate
financial privacy so that they can get their hands on any one�s money any
time they feel like it.  They will use any "wedge" issue they can create to
attack institutions that protect financial privacy.
Their attitude towards other people�s wealth most closely resembles that of
the Nazi government.  Everything should be fair game.
The bad publicity is a political maneuver on their part to make it easier to
get their hands on other people�s money.
US anti-privacy bureaucrats are also worried that the growth of electronic
banking via the Internet and other computer networks will allow Swiss Banks
to cheaply and easily offer their traditional protections to people all over
the world.
They know that if the Swiss can electronically expand their banking industry
worldwide, the ability of governments to grab other people�s money will be
b) The Facts � Nazi Gold It is true that Swiss banks, the Swiss government, and many Swiss businesses
dealt with the German government and various German citizens before, during,
and after the war.  They provided financial services to the German government
in the same way that at the peak of the Cold War, they hosted a bank owned by
the Soviet government.
To the Swiss, neutrality has always meant neutrality.  Other neutral nations
such as Sweden, Portugal, Spain, and Turkey traded with Germany as well.  It
was perfectly legal under the then existing international law and it remains
legal today.  International boycotts were unknown 60 years ago and are not
mandatory today.
Note that today the U.S. government and U.S. companies do business with
communist China.  This is the same government which murdered 50-70 million
human beings in the last 50 years.  We are "neutral" vis a vis their crimes
against humanity.  During the Cold War, India and many other countries were
neutral concerneing the Soviet Union.  This neutrality is not generally
attacked today.  After the war, the U.S. government was very upset with Switzerland.  They
wanted the Swiss to come up with gold that the Nazis had stolen and shipped
via Switzerland or via Swiss banks.  The US government (in a complete
abrogation of its contractual agreements) went so far as to seize large gold
deposits that Swiss banks and the Swiss government had at the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York.  This international depository, which still exists today,
holds gold from banks and governments all over the world and facilitates
large financial transfers among the depositors.
The US government claimed that large amounts of Nazi assets were on deposit
in Swiss banks and that the Allied Powers should get this money.  The Swiss
Banks didn�t want to destroy their system of bank secrecy and surrender to
the Allies the sovereignty they had maintained successfully against the
The Swiss government maintained that under the Hague Land Warfare Convention
of 1907, cash and valuables of an occupied state - but not of private
individuals - were subject to the occupying state�s right to the spoils of
war. Thus, Germany could have acquired gold and other assets from occupied
areas legally, and sold it.  They also said that the Swiss National Bank had
acquired the gold in good faith.
The US government also imposed controls on Swiss private holdings in the US
(approx. SFr4.5 billion) to increase its leverage in the negotiations.
Finally, in 1946, under enormous pressure the Swiss delegation offered to
settle all Allied claims by paying a lump sum of SFr. 250 million in gold
(worth today approximately SFr. 1.5 billion), which the Allies accepted,
irrevocably waiving all further claims and deblocking the billions of Swiss
Francs in frozen US accounts.
So in spite of what you may have heard, the question of Nazi gold in Swiss
banks was settled by treaty in 1946.  There is no new information on "Nazi
gold" available today.
In 1946, Switzerland and the Allies disagreed over the amount and the legal
status of gold and other property deposited by the Nazis in Switzerland. They still disagree today.
But in 1946 they did agree to settle all claims by a payment of gold so the
U.S. can't reopen this issue without breaking its treaty obligations.
c) The Facts � Jewish Accounts Both before and during the war, Jews and other victims of Nazi oppression
opened bank accounts in Switzerland.  Switzerland welcomed this money and,
indeed, passed its bank secrecy law in 1934 in part to protect these accounts
from the totalitarian nations which might want to grab them.
Many thousands of Jews who escaped from Hitler prior to the war, or who
survived the Holocaust, used their Swiss bank accounts to pay for their
escape and start their new lives in the countries into which they fled.
Recent complaints about the status of Jewish accounts in Swiss banks have
mixed in a host of extraneous issues which have to be disposed of before we
can talk about the real question.
First, it is true that Switzerland refused to accept many refugees who were
fleeing the Nazis.  Like the U.S., the U.K. and almost every other nation,
Switzerland used its tight immigration laws to block the escape of many
victims of tyranny.  Most people think this is outrageous.  It is also true,
however, that Switzerland did accept thousands of refugees in the years
between 1933 and 1938 when they decided that they had enough.  During this
same period, the U.S. admitted very few refugees.
But it is irrelevant to the issue of Jewish Bank accounts.
Second, many individual Nazis also used Swiss banks after the war to aid
their escape from Allied authorities.  This establishes nothing except the
neutrality of the Swiss banks.
The real charge is that Swiss banks have blocked attempts by the heirs of
Jewish (and presumably other) account holders to obtain the contents of those
accounts.  These are the children of the many who died in concentration camps
and who came from places where whole families, and indeed whole villages,
were wiped out by Nazi terror or who died in the awesome destruction of that
These heirs have approached Swiss banks to try to find accounts and some have
been frustrated in that attempt.
Note that no one has claimed that they were themselves an account holder and
have been unable to get their money out of their own bank.  These are
children or grandchildren who often lack specific information on the bank
accounts their parents may have held.
There are a number of things one can say about the problems someone without
documentation has getting money out of a 60-year-old bank account.
I recently asked a friend of mine, a former resident of Berlin, about this
problem.  He had been a guest of the German government in Auschwitz for a
time in the 1940s.  Today, living in America, he has the pension which
Germany pays to all concentration camp survivors paid into his Swiss bank
account.  His response: "If it was easy to get money out of Swiss banks, the
Nazis would have gotten all of it."
The fact is that Swiss banks require proof before they part with an account
holder's money.  They are not casual about other people's money like some
institutions in other countries.
Many heirs of the Nazi victims did get their money out of Swiss banks.  They
had proof that the accounts existed and that they were entitled to the funds.
 Unfortunately, others were not able to establish their claims.  The same
thing could happen in America.
All banks end up with dormant accounts over time.  People forget that they
have them or they die without heirs.  Money is often lost in this way.
In the U.S. (and all other Anglo-Saxon legal systems)  dormant accounts are
seized by state governments after a certain period of time and their contents
are blown on whatever schemes the state thinks worthwhile.  This process is
called escheatment.
If an owner finds out about the dormant account later, he can apply to the
state government for the money.
Switzerland does not practice escheatment.  If you give your money to a Swiss
bank, it will be there forever waiting for you and any heirs who have proof
that it's theirs.
The Swiss system is certainly preferable to the American system in this
Caveat:  Keep good records (including records not located where you live) and
make sure your heirs can find out where your accounts are.

In general, possession constitutes the criterion of title of personal property, because no other means exist by which a knowledge of the fact to whom it belongs can be attained.

be very hard to determine who owns what once it is out of possession because
it all looks alike.
Most of the assets involved (by volume and value) were the property of
governments that had been conquered by Germany or property confiscated from
German citizens.  Unfortunately, German citizens (like American citizens) are
not protected by international law from predation by their own government. Private citizens of conquered countries would be protected but proof will be
hard.  All of these issues were debated at length in 1946 and settled by the
Washington Agreement.  The U.S., Britain, and France sat on the gold that
Switzerland transferred to it for 50 years (in the basement of the FRB NYC)
parcelling it out in dribs and drabs mostly to the treasuries of the
conquered nations.  They still have a fair chunk of it  and are trying to
figure who to give it to.  I guess holding other people's gold is OK some of
the time.
Article II.2 of the Washing ton Agreement stipulated: "The Allied Governments declare on their part that, in accepting this amount,
waive in their name and in the name of their banks of issue all claims
against the
Government of Switzerland and the Swiss National Bank in connection with gold
acquired during the war from Germany by Switzerland. All questions relative
to such
gold will thus be regulated." Switzerland transferred appox 1,658,000 oz of gold to the Allies with a
current value of $568,750,000.

The Inducement of Rapid Oxidation of Certain Materials in or Near Government
Tim is neither a democrat nor a participant in a democracy.  Note that all
the parties involved in the current Balkans war are governments (or claim to
be). Most of the violence in interactions between people and governments is on the
government side.  The U.S. government and others have been committing mass
murder for years.  Supporters of those governments thus support mass murder
for "political ends."
Governments have murdered 170 million people since 1900.  My
back-of-the-envelope estimate is that the civilians of the world have only
murdered about 20 million people in the same period of time.  Quite a
The U.S. government and its subsidiaries (for example) annually kill hundreds
of people in carrying out the "war" on the unlicensed retailing of
pharmaceuticals.  The U.S. was convicted of war crimes in the International
Court of Justice in the Hague in the late 80's for dropping air-sown mines in
one of Nicaragua's harbors.  The U.S. practices the mass bombing of civilian
populations in wartime which causes a very great loss of innocent life.  Many
of the other governments of the world are worse.
The principle of estoppel would seem to logically preclude the world's
governments from arguing that their mass murders are OK but those committed
by amateurs (which kill many fewer people) aren't.
Again, and in general, some of the readers of this and other recent threads
on cypherpunks need some reading lessons (present company excepted).  Tim May
has not advocated blowing things up (though such advocacy remains legal).  He
has not advocated that cypherpunks blow things up.  He has not advocated that
Timothy McVeigh blow things up.  He has not even said that blowing things up
is a hip and happening way to raise the average IQ and moral level of the
surviving population.  He has merely said that if OTHER PEOPLE blow certain things up he understands
their actions and that in the case of certain targets he would not shed a
tear.  He also predicted that people will be blowing things up in the future
(with which prediction, even the U.S. government agrees).
In any case, cypherpunks' orientation is towards the mathematics of
cryptography rather than towards chemical engineering.

Except that their branch of the "fork" is illusory.  It depends on public
support and physical powers they lack.  The reason that I'm a technoptimist is *not* because I think that modern
technology is an all-powerful mechanism which has shattered the control
capabilities of the coercive state apparatus.  The really beautiful thing is
that today's technology is merely piling onto a pre-existing trend which
favored individual choice.
Things were already trending towards markets and self government long before
crypto and the Internet hit the front pages.  Even mainframe computers
helped.  If you look at the graphs, you'll see that computers started forcing
institutional downsizing as early as the late '60s in the U.S. and Britain.  Mechanical technology and the wealth it produced was sufficient to get things
going.  Since the Second World War, people have been getting wealthier and
hence more powerful.  First here in America and later spreading throughout
the worlds like a health-giving virus.
Remember, it's not just technology.  If I can move and trade in a very
efficient market, I have a lot more power than someone with my same level of
wealth in a primitive society with limited capabilities.
Cheap radios (the first micro technology product) and jet engines helped push
things along as much as anything.  The slow development of market
institutions which, today, give individuals the power to buy, sell, and lease
almost any good or service eventually reached a critical point as well.
Rich people are *much* harder to push around than poor people.  (If you push
them too much, they just leave.)  So factories produced wealth which produced
power which automatically increased individual choice.  You will note that
the 60's happened, for example.  As time went on, markets spread, tyranny
contracted and people became harder and harder to control (for good or ill). Pile crypto and the Net onto this trend, and you get an accelerated
beneficial movement towards enhanced personal choice.  Obviously, "the
generation that was born into bondage in Egypt cannot enter the Promised
Land."  They have to die off before the changes can become obvious to all. The Net can help in this by changing our cultural and social environment so
much that it allows us to, in the words of yet another Timothy, "Metaprogram
the human biocomputer."
I must say, however, that I find it hard to believe that other people can't
see the amazing progress that we've made in the last decade.  The utter
destruction of totalitarian communism, the transformation of Latin America
from 26 dictatorships and 1 democracy a few years ago to 26 (more or less)
democracies and 1 dictatorship today, the liberation of the Forex markets,
the ideological dominance of market liberalism, the Death of the PTT
communications monopolies, the deregulation of transportation, the lowering
of trade barriers, etc.
Note that last month, Mongolia became the first country since the dawn of the
nation state to abolish all tarrifs and quotas.  Now if you can just get to
it, you can trade freely.
The control capabilities of the government depend on the attitude of the
people.  If they support the government or are intimidated by it, they will
obey.  Today, support for most OECD governments is at historic lows. Cynicism about government policies is widespread.  And the simple ignoring of
rules and regs is "out of control."

Dan White, San Francisco Supervisor and killer of Mayor Moscone and Harvey
Milk (1978) committed suicide after he had been released from serving his 5
years and 2 months maximum sentence for manslaughter.  (Depression which made
him incapable of forming the specific intent required to be guilty of
murder.)  Feinstein had been a friend of his when he was on the Board of
Supes and it is possible that one of the reasons he lost it during the crisis
over his resignation and attempt to get back on the Board was because
Feinstein was in Nepal on her honeymoon (millionaire second husband) and
wasn't there to support him. [I may be partially to blame as well.  I was living in Dan White's district
(the oppressed white working class part of SF) at the time of his original
election.  He dropped by the house and solicited my vote.  I voted for him,
in fact.  And he certainly turned out to be a supporter of the revolutionary
aspirations of his community.  The least disappointing politician I ever
voted for.]
Feinstein want to grab your guns because she is an authoritarian.  Not
because of any particular experiences she's had with guns.  She has shown
equal contempt for the First Amendment and the Second.  She's ma woman and a
commie liberal.  What can one expect.
While mayor of San Francisco, she indulged in a number of famous suppressions
of free speech:
1)  She cancelled the appearance of the Turkish Folklorico Ballet because of
demonstration threats from the (no longer starving) Armenians.
2)  She tried to ban the showing of whatever that dumb New York gang movie
was after a stabbing at one of the theaters showing it.
3)  She pressured a clothing store to pull its billboard ad campaign
"Feinstyle" which featured a (fully clothed) reclining, look-alike model
wearing her sort of scarf and business attire.
Her current humorous attempt to ban "bomb plans" from the Net is just part of
the pattern.  [Humorous because such bans went out the door with Gutenberg
about 500 years ago.]
Her administration also attempted to ban handgun sales in San Franciso but
because California gun nuts had long ago enacted one of the state preemption
laws that the NRA used to push, the courts threw her ban out.  [These laws
say that only the state government can regulate guns.]
If I were her, I'd probably "fear the revolutionary justice of the people" as
well.  [If you've ever seen film of these female congresscritters brandishing
assault rifles at a dog and pony show where they are supposed to examine
these "weapons of war", you'd certainly agree that *they* shouldn't be
allowed to handle guns.]

@_subject: Jim Bell goes to Jail--We should avoid raidable, physical meeting 
It might be hard to win lawsuits *against* the Feds although Steve Jackson Games did and other false arrest suits have succeeded.  The reverse of this
is that the Feds would have a very hard time winning a criminal case based on mass arrests at a Cypherpunks meeting.  They have lost loads of First Amendment busts over the years.  They have also lost the last few sedition cases they've brought even though the targets (white supremecists) were less popular than we would prove to be in court.  Many of us also have the intellectual and financial resources to mount an effective defense.  They would lose.
Everything dismissed.  Just harrassment.  There were some actual arrests for tresspassing.  Cypherpunks meetings, however, are held with the permission of the building owners so such charges would fail in our case. I think the Feds case against JB is probably pretty weak.  Though we don't know the extent of his actions in the physical (as opposed to the spiritual) realm.  Arrests are frequently used to intimidate but dismissals or failure
to prosecute are very common in cases involving political dissent.

I've been using 4.5 since it was in Beta and I paid the $29.95 to upgrade to it when they started charging (they have you cut and paste your public key into the form to prove you are upgrading from a free version of PGP).
I downloaded 5.0 a day or two ago and have been using it.  It is possible to use both on the same machine although you have to watch your key location.
I Use Windows 95.  Installation of PGP for Personal Privacy 5.0 went OK.  Unless you have the latest Beta of Eudora (3.0.2 B4) it installs the files necessary to upgrade your version of Eudora.  Unfortunately, 3.0.2 B4 expires in June so you'll  have to continue upgrading.   My only problem was that when I had the program move and rename my key rings, I forgot which key file I was pointing to and made my secret ring my public ring for a few minutes until I reinstalled.  The program puts its menu into the "tray".  Its menu is shorter than the PGP Mail 4.5 menu because the key handling is done from the PGPkeys program.  It displays a graphic key list and you can point and click and drag and drop to perform most key management tasks.
The new features are 1) automatic lookup of keys from the keyserver of your choice (defaults to PGP Incs keyserver).  2) automatic signing (or even encryption) of outgoing mail.  You click  in Eudora and it prompts you for your passphrase.  3) Use of ElGamal (DSS/Diffie-Hellman) instead of RSA for your key if you like.  4) Use of PGP/Mime for outgoing messages if you like.  5) it will cache you private key in memory for a user configurable length of time (default is 120 seconds) so that you can easily encrypt multiple messages.
It has worked fine so far.  Digital signing and encryption seem faster than with 4.5.

I'm always amazed at the large number of people who don't know that you don't have to talk to the cops.  It's not just the 5th Amendment BTW.  You don't have to talk to them because you don't have to talk to anybody.  Cops can give you orders to do certain things when you're out in public
(stop, turn left, etc.).  They can't order you to do things outside the limited
scope of vehicle and crowd management.  They can't order you to give them $20 and they can't order you to talk to them.  They can arrest you with probable
cause and detain you briefly for purposes of investigation.  They can ask you for your name and you may have to supply it, but that's about it.  If you're operating a motor vehicle, they can ask you for ID.  Not too much else.
Since cops are not judges, they can't order you to do things outside of the above.  You may be compelled to testify in court or at other sorts of hearings, but you *never* have to talk to cops.  And you never should unless you're asking them for help of some kind.

@_subject: Forgeries are your Friend 
So far in my close observation of the history of American jurisprudence I haven't seen too many written things that were legal at one point and later became (criminally) illegal.  I've never seen someone punished criminally (in violation of the Constitution's ban on ex post facto laws) for past speech that became retroactively illegal.
Some people have been sued and suffered financially for speech or writing that had been "legal" and became "illegal" at some indeterminate time (racism, sexism, bigotry, and homophobia par exaple) but examples of criminal prosecution are much harder to think of.
There is the "hate speech" sentence enhancement to other crimes (beat up an old lady for kicks and serve time for assault beat up an old lady while saying unkind things about women and serve time for assault + hate speech).  Certain kiddie porn definitions changed as well but I didn't see any ex post facto repeals in there.  As long as you said/published stuff before it was illegal, you were OK.
On the other hand, I've seen loads of things that used to be illegal to say/publish legalized over the years though most of them were civil rather than criminal matters to begin with.
I've also seen plenty of cases (Jake Baker, Phil Zimmerman, the SEC vs the Financial Newsletters, the CDA) in which I knew in advance that the case was dead meat as soon as it got to an appeals court (or before).  Those pure speech cases (in the absence of filthy pictures) are the easiest ones to win.
I always encourage those arrested in such cases to take a hard line and abuse the prosecutors with the unwinnability of their cases.  If you've got it, flaunt it.
Jim Bell may do some time for tax evasion but they could have got him on that at any time.  He won't be doing any time for publishing AP.  And we won't be doing any time for what we say on this list.

Entrepreneurs Become Leaders In the New World, Flores Says
I FIRST HEARD the name Fernando Flores...
Before I had the chance to check out the guy, I received an e-mail from a former top Air Force general. He mentioned he had been deeply influenced by a philosopher, business consultant and onetime political prisoner named Fernando Flores. How often do you see those descriptions on the same resume?
Trained as an engineer, at age 28 he became finance minister in the Marxist regime of Salvador Allende in 1970. ....
THEN, IN 1973, ... Mr. Flores spent three years in prison brooding over the notion of computers for communication rather than computation. ...
When Amnesty International and others won his release in 1976 ...
- From the German philosopher Martin Heidegger he learned ...
"A human society," as he puts it, "operates through the expression of requests and promises."
A business, likewise, is a collection of simultaneous conversations, and every conversation involves an act of commitment. ...
Working with the computer scientist Terry Winograd, he created a product to transform computer workstations from solitary appliances into devices for tracking commitments between workers. ... "groupware." ...
IF DR. FLORES becomes famous for anything, it may be for a concept of entrepreneurialism he has described in a forthcoming book from MIT Press called "Disclosing New Worlds," co-authored with the philosophers Charles Spinosa and Hubert Dreyfus. In a time of vapid values and insipid politics, they say entrepreneurs are becoming the leaders of the world. While the typical capitalist merely forecasts human needs, they argue, "the entrepreneur is the person who determines which needs will seem important."

Fascinating article in last Saturday's New York Times about INS plans to revoke the U.S. citizenship of 5,000 people who got that citizenship sans criminal background checks so they could vote for Clinton in '96.
Now, the INS revokes a big 25 citizenships a year so they really have a job ahead of them.  Demonstrates the enforcement challenges of bureaucracies living in a mass society.  They think they can get away with administrative revocations but even those can be appealed to federal court.  5,000 appeals would be quite a burden.  If they wait too long and two years pass from time of granting, the Service will lose the administrative option and will have to do full court proceedings to revoke.
Even if they revoke, the "aliens" will still have their old proofs of citizenship (passports, etc) as well as their former status as permanent residents so revocation may be meaningless in any case.
That's not the cutest bit, though.
In addition to the 5,000 new Clinton voters with provable criminal records, they had to go through 180,000 records of people with various sorts of documentation problems to see if any of them were criminals.  But the Feds couldn't do it themselves.  They lacked the capability.  They hired one of
the big accounting firms (Peat-Marwick?) to CHECK THE NAMES against the NCIC.  They got some 9,000 positive matches but naturally, they can't tell how many of those 9,000 matches are false positives.  Lots of work ahead.
The gloom and doom types like to claim that it is trivial for the almighty Feds to find out everything about every one, look inside the souls of all of us, separate the good from the evil and unerringly punish the evil.  Omniscience, omnipresence, omnipotence. Oddly enough, this claim is often
made by people who, otherwise, don't believe in God.
But this article on citizenship revocation gives lie to this claim of state power.  Citizenship applicants have submitted vast quantities of information about themselves to the Feds.  They have undergone years of a staged and complex process to move from nonresident alien to resident alien to citizen.  At every point, they NARCed themselves out in detail directly to the federal government.  And yet, that same government can't even tell if these people
are If they can't efficiently surveil and regulate this group, what chance do
they have to regulate and surveil the other 260 million of us?

Forbes - 18 November 1996
"And don't come back"
By Robert Lenzner In August 1996 the Republicans pasted some anti-taxpatriate language into the Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act. This law now subjects expatriates with a net worth of over $500,000 to taxation on their income earned in the U.S. for ten years from the time they renounce their citizenship, no matter where they live or whose flag they salute. But this is a law without teeth. Any clever entrepreneur can live by borrowing against assets rather than paying himself an income. Any good international tax lawyer can move ownership of U.S. assets into a foreign corporation or trust, thus making most taxpatriates' U.S.-sourced income vanish.
The latest effort to keep intrepid taxpatriates on the reservation was passed with no fanfare in early October. A little-noticed provision of the Illegal Immigration Reform & Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 says, in essence, that Americans can still renounce their citizenship and flee to tax havens like the Bahamas, Ireland and Switzerland. But if they do, they can't necessarily come back to the U.S., not even to visit the grandkids or attend their college reunions.
Under the new law, the taxpatriate�any expatriate for that matter�must apply for a visa for every visit. The law states that the U.S. Attorney General may prohibit the issuance of a visa to a former U.S. citizen if there are solid grounds to believe that citizenship was renounced in order to avoid taxes.
In short, taxpatriates will now be treated as exiles without any visiting rights, just like the illegal immigrants the U.S. wants to cut off.
Utterly meaningless in both cases since, as mentioned, you can move your wealth overseas and in the case of the visa requirement, first they have to flag you as an expatriate and even if they do that, you can enter the U.S. via Canada, Mexico, or the   Caribbean which are all inside the "US Passport Control Area."

The phrase "capital crime" (literaly "head crime") just means "worst crime".  It does not imply punishment.  Punishment for capital crimes varies with time and place.  Saying someone is guilty of an infamous crime is not a death threat.  It's not even a death threat to say, "I think X should be arrested, tried by a court, and gassed."  You are merely expressing opinions about criminal guilt and perhaps capital punishment but you are not making a "Hey, hey, LBJ.  How many kids did you kill today?"

The opening of  "HOW TO BREAK THE LAW"
By Duncan Frissell For a fair number of readers, the day may come when the men in the funny
suits walk up to you, ask if you are you, and then exercise their power of
arrest. For those without much experience in getting arrested, let me tell
you what in general it will be like (details may vary). But first let's review arrest etiquette. Arrest etiquette can be
complicated for the arresting officers but it is easy for the arrestee.
There are only two rules: 1) Keep your mouth shut and 2) Cooperate
physically with the arrest. Following rule two will help preserve your
kidneys, limbs, and skull but following rule one is the most important. During the first two years after your arrest, there are only four words
that you should speak to minions of the State in an official capacity: "I want a lawyer" Say nothing else. You gain NO benefits by saying things to the cops and the
prosecutors for free. If your lawyer cuts a deal for you, you can talk in
exchange for something but once you speak you can't take the words back.
Lawyers are constantly amazed and entertained by the things their clients
tell the cops. Don't say anything. It's stupid.

I was discussing this very question with the inamorata of a member of this
list recently in San Jose.  We were trying to figure out why I knew
instinctively what to say when confronted with government agents and she
didn't (though she is an attorney).  I figured out that it was because I
read Heinlein.  He taught a lot about how to respond to these things.
Those who haven't read Heinlein (or don't learn from books) won't know what
to say.  And in these high stress situations, answers which you have
thought about in advance or conducted mental simulations with will come out
more easily.  You say - "Go away."  "Write me a letter."  "I only deal with government
agents via my lawyer."  "Where's Your Warrant."  Or how about -- "My
lawyer's name is X, I have officially informed you that I am represented by
counsel and thus you cannot question me without counsel being present."
When they write a letter, you handle it the way Rumpole of the Baily
handled those letters from the Inland Revenue.  You throw it away.
Some years ago at 5000 Bonny Doone Road Santa Cruz, CA an IRS agent rang
the bell outside the gate in the fence of the reinforced concrete house
owned by Robert Anson Heinlein.  He wanted to talk.  Heinlein said "go
away" "write a letter."  The Agent said "you're not going to make me drive
all the way back to San Jose, are you?"  Heinlein said "Yes."
You don't have to talk to government agents -- even if they arrest you.
Saying "No" and "Go Away" is short and easy to say.  Just Say No.

Castro was in Spain on the same day Spain tried to extradite Pinochet.
Pinochet is accused of murdering 4K people.  Castro murdered many more than
4K people.  Gorby had a couple of massacres during his regime.  One in the
Baltics and as I recall one in Georgia.  I'm sure collectively he killed
more than 4K of people.  He no longer has diplomatic immunity either.  My
point is not that we shouldn't grab them it's that the "Human Rights
Community" is politically discriminatory and wouldn't think of going after
How about Mandella.  The Truth and Reconcilliation Commission report says
that the ANC was guilty of plenty of human rights violations.
The very fact that some people who once had political credibility, like FDR
or Henry Wallace, support Joe Stalin is exactly the reasom why he should be
tried.  We need to draw the line...
And how about all those American commies whose cancelled paychecks from
Moscow we recently recovered from the KGB files.  And what about the Butcher of Waco?
Be careful with this argument because Pinochet could propose a necessity
defense.  If you say communism is worse, then he can say he had to do it to
prevent communism.  Also, "human rights violation" is a vague charge.  There are students in
the UK who are mad at Red Tony for the human rights violation of starting
to charge college tuition and depriving them of a free college education.
American tax cutters are regularly accused of the "human rights violation"
of letting people keep more of their own money.
It can hardly be illegal for governments to kill their own citizens.  They
do it all the time.  The US governments kill hundreds or thousands every
year depending on how you do the math.  Better to use straight criminal law (or revolution) and inevitably let some
heads of state escape justice than to indulge in the ex post facto

"In a depressing turn for law-enforcement authorities, prepaid service has

Prepaid Plans Start to Open Up The Cellular-Phone Market
By GAUTAM NAIK Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
Warren Pippin, a police officer in Savannah, Ga., ditched his traditional
cellular-phone contract two years ago. "I couldn't stand paying bills every
month," he says. "This is so much simpler."
Now he uses prepaid cellular-phone service, a plan that was hatched in
Portugal four years ago, took Europe by storm and is finally catching on in
the U.S. A user simply buys an off-the-shelf phone, along with a card
representing a certain financial value. The phone is activated by dialing a
phone number and a personal identification number printed on the card. When
the money runs out, the card can be replenished via a fresh payment.
Those are just the basics. In Portugal, refinements let prepaid users
replenish their cards at automated teller machines. And wherever it is
used, the prepaid method is democratizing a product and service long
confined to the well-heeled. Although only 2% of America's 54 million
wireless subscribers use prepaid service today, most are people who
otherwise wouldn't dream of owning a mobile phone: inner-city residents,
students, people with poor credit.
While rates for prepaid service are generally higher than regular cellular
plans, users have no 12-month contracts or monthly fees to contend with.
All told, compared with regular "leisure" users, prepaid customers spend
roughly 15% to 25% less per month.
"Prepay is enabling people that have wanted wireless phones for a long,
long time to finally get one," says Terry Hayes, a marketing executive at
Omnipoint Corp., which recently launched a "no monthly fee" prepaid
offering. The company, which operates from Maine to Maryland, sells prepaid
phones in colorful packages at gas stations, Duane Reade drugstores and its
own outlets. Every second Omnipoint customer has prepaid service.
'Best Thing for Kids'
Page Tel, a wireless-service reseller in Detroit, has signed up 85,000
prepaid mobile-phone users, most of them students and inner-city residents.
One popular product costs $39, and includes a Motorola flip phone. "It's
the best thing for kids," says Laith Korkis, the owner of Page Tel. "They
buy a $39 phone and a $10 prepaid card and walk down the street looking cool."
In a depressing turn for law-enforcement authorities, prepaid service has
caught on with drug dealers and other criminals. With no contract and no
bills, there is no paper trail -- a feature that also makes the service
attractive to tax evaders.
Europe's prepaid users number some 14 million, or 20% of all mobile
subscribers. By the end of 1998, the number of prepaid users will rise to
22 million, or 25% of the total European market, according to Salomon Smith
Barney. In the U.S., playing catch up, virtually every big wireless
provider has jumped into prepaid service: Half of PrimeCo Personal
Communications LP's customers are prepaid, while 40% of BellSouth Corp.'s
subscribers are. Prepaid will make up 25% of all new wireless sign-ups this
year, estimates Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
U.S. providers remain technologically behind their European counterparts,
who adopted digital standards far earlier. European digital phones have a
special card that can be inserted into the phone to activate special
features such as Portugal's ATM replenishment. In the U.S., users can only
replenish their prepaid phone by paying cash at a store or via credit card.
Portugal Telecom SA, Portugal's main phone company, got the idea for
prepaid cellular service when executives realized that the nation's
sophisticated network of ATMs could be used as mobile-phone "refueling"
stations. The service was launched in 1995; today, 68% of all Portugal
Telecom's mobile-phone customers are prepaid.
Telecel Communicacoes Pessoais SA, a rival wireless carrier that is 50.9%
owned by Airtouch Communications Inc. of the U.S., has been equally
aggressive. Its Vitamina prepaid phones are sold in brightly colored
packages, each shaped in the form of a pill. One popular brand is aimed at
corporations: The company can specify exactly how much credit it wants each
employee's phone to have, and how often the credit should be topped up.
The Frog Factor
Another product, Vitamina K (for kid), is for children ages eight to 15.
The phones look like frogs and have six colorful buttons that can be
programmed by a parent. "One is for mummy, two for daddy, three for
grandma. That's all the kid has to know," explains Joao Mendes Dias,
Telecel's product-marketing director.
An especially big hit is Vitamina R (for radicals), sold to the
15-to-24-year-old set and featuring only fashionable Ericsson or Nokia
models. If a Vitamina R customer calls another Vitamina R user, the call is
35% cheaper than calling someone else. And the advertising slogan has its
fans, as well: "Vitamina R. It heals everything but hangovers."
Sandra Santos, a 21-year-old student in Lisbon, likes her snazzy Vitamina
phone because it provides a running display of the credit available at any
time. When she runs low, there is always a cash machine nearby. Thanks to
special calling rates, her Vitamina bills are half what she paid with a
previous subscription plan. And her previous phone? "I gave that to my
dad," she says.
Airtouch now hopes to apply Telecel's ideas-especially the savvy marketing

Most of the "Department of Children's Services" seizures of kiddies that are fodder for Net libertarians and right wing nuts would not have occurred had the little nipper's parents not handed them over to the educational authorities in the first place.  Since sending one's kids to slave schools is the world's most common form of child abuse, the fact that families are "punished" for it by having their kids drugged, lobotomized, and (occasionally) seized is not as troubling as it would be had they not decided to damage their kids themselves by entrusting their brains to the No government school = no files = no starting point for oppression of children by the authorities.

The company is claiming breach of franchise agreement by franchisees who are supposedly  saying unkind things about it.  It is also claiming that the domain names newworldcoffefraud.com and newworldfraud.com are likely to confuse innocent surfers looking for coffee.
The sites claim that NWC is guilty of fraud in selling franchises and lack of support for franchisees once they buy in.
The defendants have no lawyers and are proceeding in pro se.  The sites may be gone Friday night if the judge rules against them.

Last Friday in Union County (NJ) Superior Court in Elizabeth, the operator of  won a solo victory against three sets of lawyers when he convinced the judge not to issue a TRO against his corporate disparagement site.
New World Coffee a NJ-based coffee and bagel franchise company was represented by
PIPER MARBURY RUDNICK & WOLFE LLP (the Washington DC firm that represented AOL in its anti-spam litigation), RABINOWITZ, TRENK, LUBETKIN & TULLY (a NJ firm), as well as New World Coffee's General Counsel.
The company made a series of claims in seeking a TRO including breach of franchise agreement by franchisees who are supposedly  saying unkind things about it.  It is also claiming that the domain names newworldcoffefraud.com and newworldfraud.com are likely to confuse innocent surfers looking for coffee (dilution).  There was also and Anti-Cybersquatting Act claim.
The judge didn't seem too concerned about the contract claims but was initially inclined to block the defendant's use of domain names for dilution and cybersquatting. But once the defendant presented a whois list of the hundreds of domain names containing the words "new world" (New World Coffee does not control newworld.com, .org, or .net) she dismissed the cybersquatting argument.  Dilution was thrown out after the defendant argued that all of the cited cases involved domain names that were initially confusing versions of trademarks (jews-for-jesus.org, plannedparenthood.org, etc.)  The judge agreed that even the most casual viewer would not confuse newworldcoffeefraud.com with the trademark holder's site.
The underlying case is still active and plaintiffs are seeking early discovery to see if they can uncover the defendant's sources.  He is defending using the NJ shield law for journalists.
Any New Jersey lawyers interested in the case?

From Declan's story:
Because Bell repeatedly said he would not violate the law, Leen had hoped to raise a First Amendment defense -- essentially saying that because the law protects advocacy of violent acts, the jury can find Bell to be not guilty as charged. Leen asked the judge to incorporate a First Amendment defense in instructions to the jury.
But Tanner nixed that idea. He said he did not believe Bell was engaged in political speech.
"Are the IRS laws political?" Tanner asked. "I thought they were passed by Congress and signed by the president."
Tanner suggested the IRS was as apolitical as a highway "speed limit."
"I'm going to deny those instructions," Tanner said, which means the jury will not consider the First Amendment implications of the charges against Bell.
Declan, did anyone in court burst into hysterical laughter?  I would have had a hard time restraining myself and would now be a guest of the Feds, I While it is true that trial courts hate 1A defenses and leave such things to the appeals courts, this is truly funny.
Tanner is carving out a yet another "commercial speech" exception to the 1st arguing that mere government administration is not "political" and thus not open to full speech protection.  He is certainly wrong.

I know that there has been an increase in punishments levied on the institutionalized populations of our many local institutions for the mentally challenged, but any parent who  turns his children's body and brain over to a bureaucracy for training deserves what they get (though the children/victims do not).  And since most of these punishments consist of removing the child from the institution in question, it's hard to see to see them as genuine punishments.  They're actually helpful to the poor tykes.
There hasn't been a statistically significant increase in imprisonment of adults (or non-institutionalized children) for thought crime.  You might have argued the case in '92 and '93 when the Feds were investing various "compounds" of thought criminals around the country but the Fibbies got burned so bad that they snatched their hands back.  Note that Weaver, Harris, and the Waco 11 were all acquitted of murder in the killing of federal agents.  Real slap in the face to Main Justice.
What's the "or worse"?
The Ninth Circuit where Jeff would put Tim or whoever on trial has been very protective of the First.  Note the Nuremberg Files case.  That Court of Appeals  has the most libertarian Appeals Court Judge (Kozinski) and there is loads circuit precedent for political speech protection.
And all of the agitation and possible targeting of this list as well as the Libertarian Party of Washington would give anyone with half a brain yet another defense - selective prosecution.  We have quite a bit of evidence of punishment for participating in a public forum.  There's 9th circuit precedent for that defense too from back when the Hawaii US attorney prosecuted the Hawaii 4 for census resistance in 1970 after census resistance was advocated on KTRG radio.  See US v. Watamull.
CJ & JB are partially responsible for their problems.  Unlike JB, for example, I'll never volunteer to the commission of a federal felony on the witness stand (mail tampering) that the Feds didn't even know about.  There's such a thing as a special kind of stupid.
JB plead out in his first case which didn't gain him anything except more trouble.  Better not to plead in political cases.  And CJ waived a jury.  Most 1A defenses work only on appeal so the jury isn't that important but it can help.
Both needed good appeal lawyers.  Most of the rest of the possible targets will have good lawyers (or be good enough ones).
I do think that there has been a bit too much cooperation with the Feds by members of this list.  Two members have talked to Fibbies who showed up at their doors.  They should have told them to get lost (as one always should).  Think about it folks.  The more time you spend in the presence of peace officers, the more information you give them for free whether by word, body language, or opportunities for visual inspection of your surroundings.  Don't interact.  You don't have to.
And the several list members who have been subpoenaed could have done a little more to resist.
When one receives a subpoena,  the first thing you should do is throw it away.  You can always wimp out later if you want but if you ignore the initial contact, they may go away.  Make them do a little heavy lifting.
Then if you are free to move, you should arrange to vacation overseas.  If you have a job (reporter) that can be performed by Net and telephone, you should go to Canada where you can continue to work easily.  If you can't move, you should at least wait for a second communication of some sort from the government.
If you receive a second contact, you should point out that you will be a hostile witness and do nothing but verbally abuse them from the stand.  You can prove your facility at this by verbally abusing them over the phone.
If you are on the Right Coast and the court venue is on the Left Coast, you should immediately bundle up all your "government issued picture IDs" and burn them so you can't fly.
Less easily, you could also try and weight 320 pounds so that carrying you will prove difficult for US Marshals.  You might also try to be suffering from a potentially fatal disease so that threats from the Feds can be placed in the proper perspective.  [Since, for now, we all *do* suffer from a potentially fatal disease (life), threats from the Feds should already be placed in a proper perspective.]  Lastly, if you develop studious habits, you will discover that "prison is no punishment for the literate."
Make *them* oppress you!  Don't do it to yourself.  They can't force you to speak.  You have control of your voluntary muscles.  Show a little backbone.

Special agents should read the Economist in addition to NLECTC Law Enforcement & Corrections Technology News Summary The lemon dilemma
Oct 11th 2001
 From The Economist print edition
This year's Nobel prize for economics honours work inspired by a simple observation about used cars
This year's other two laureates, Michael Spence of Stanford University and Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia, won their prize for analysing how firms and consumers separate the gems from the lemons in a variety of industries.
Mr Spence's early work focused on how individuals use signalling to communicate their abilities in the labour market. Job applicants, for example, want to distinguish themselves from the mass of other hopefuls. They may try to do this in a number of ways, from a fancy suit to a fancy education. But for signals to be believable, Mr Spence observed, they need to differ substantially in their cost of acquisition. For example, for education to work as a credible signal, it must be harder for less able employees to get. Indeed, even if such an education gives a student no tangible skillsreading classics at Oxford, sayit can still be a useful signal of relative quality to employers.
Signalling is used in many markets, wherever a person, company or government wants to provide information about its intentions or strengths indirectly. Taking on debt might signal that a company is confident about future profits. Brands send valuable signals to consumers precisely because they are costly to create, and thus will not be lightly abused by their creators. Advertising may convey no information other than that the firm can afford to advertise, but that may be all a consumer needs to know to have confidence in it. Perhaps advertising, as a signal, is not money entirely wasted, as some economists argue.
It's all about signaling.

For a brilliant illustration of how to avoid official regulatory regimes read:
On Burning Ground
by Michael Skakun
This is the story of the author's father, Joseph Skakun, a rabbinical student who lived in a small Polish village at the time of the Nazi invasion.
He was faced with certain legal and practical difficulties that he had to He was fluent only in Yiddish, he was circumcised, his experience was limited to Yeshiva and shetel life.
By the end of the war, he was an SS recruit living in Germany officially designated as a Lithuanian (and thus almost an Aryan in the Nazi racial classification scheme).
His main survival technique (which all of us can use) was to analyze a harsh regulatory regime, find a category uncovered by the harshness, and include yourself in that category.
The one survival technique he possessed was knowledge.
Just to give you a flavor...  He dealt with his circumcision "problem" not by sleeping with hooks and weights (as some other Jews did), but simply by knowing that several small communities of Tartars lived in Poland.  These residual invaders from the past were Muslims and thus circumcised.  He merely declared himself a Tartar.
Author Michael Skakun was lucky in his choice of parents.  His next book is going to be about his mother who was a member of a community of Jews exported to Siberia to save them from the Nazis.  She then walked to Tehran and the Brits shipped her to Palestine (by ship) in the middle of the war.

More important than bank secrecy itself is the ability to easily create legal entities.  One of the reason that the US is a popular tax haven (for non-US persons) is because it is so easy to create various business and personal entities here.

The Economist 11 Jan 2001
The Internet was supposed to be all about freedom. That is why governments want to regulate it. It is far from certain whether freedom, or government control, will win the day.
"Both filtering and IP-address tracking are far from perfect. Filters generally block too muchand too little. And surfers can block IP-address tracking by using services such as Zero Knowledges Freedom or anonymizer.com. In any case, knowing where a user is is only part of the solution. In the case of Yahoo!, the firm would still have to work out which auctions to block.
But do these shortcomings matter? Jack Goldsmith, a law professor at the University of Chicago, argues that the real world is full of imperfect filtering and identification techniques: criminals crack safes, 15-year-olds visit bars with fake IDs, secret information is leaked to the press. To Mr Goldsmith, there is little doubt that filtering and identification technologies will help to make cyberspace more regulated, because they will allow governments to raise the cost of getting certain Save that in the real world, I can't write and instantly distribute a program which will let anyone easily crack safes or accomplish other tasks that government may seek to block.  As we've seen, BTW, I *can* distribute fake ID's and fake ID technology easily and swiftly over the Net these days.
Since even the most casual Net surfer is using an incredibly complex suite of software and electronic communications protocols, we've established that complexity, alone, is not enough to block the use of technology.  Adding a new software/protocol layer designed to defeat new government control attempts is no more complex than what we are using already.
If motivated by the ability to acquire "free" content or "forbidden" content, people have already shown themselves willing to download and install software.  They will in the future.
"The holy grail for e-commerce, however, would be a system in which users had permanent digital certificates on their computers containing details of age, citizenship, sex, professional credentials, and so on. Such technology would not only allow websites to aim their services at individuals, but would let governments reclaim their authority. These solutions to Internet regulation are far off, if they fly at all. But Lawrence Lessig, a law professor at Stanford University, warns that e-commerce firms will push for such certificates and that governments may one day require them."
Require them, for what?  In the US, licensing of speech and the press is specifically prohibited, and anyone on earth can effectively become a US person by opening a telecoms account here.
Before the Internet "broke wide", we developed an international store-and-forward network (Fidonet) using the Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS).  The Internet is not one network but thousands.
If individuals choose to communicate, it is hard to stop them in the modern age.  And that is what we have, a choice.
Legally, the Net is a series of Virtual Private Networks (VPN's).  If one aspect of the Net becomes too restrictive, it is trivial to deploy a new VPN with the liberated character that users may prefer.  That is what the various peer-to-peer networks are.
"On the Internet, the struggle between freedom and state control will rage for some time. But if recent trends in online regulation prove anything, it is that technology is being used by both sides in this battle and that freedom is by no means certain to win. The Internet could indeed become the most liberating technology since the printing press but only if governments let it."
Johannes Gutenberg (1398-1468) The printing press was not liberating because governments decided to let it be liberating.  They didn't have a choice.  The technology made the communication of ideas easier and so it was easier.   The Reformation, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, etc. followed.
The printing press worked these changes not because it was impossible for governments to censor printing or even to jail printers.  It worked these changes because the technology let millions of individuals preserve and spread their ideas easily and cheaply.  In spite of controls.  It took from circa 1455 to 1776 for the changes allowed by printing to come to fruition.  It will be a bit faster for the Net.
The Net makes the communication of zeros and ones even easier than printing.  In addition, we have developed so many ephemeral goods and services since 1455 (money, video, audio, etc.) that in addition to mere ideas, the net can transfer actual value.  Trade.  This has obvious implications for attempts by states to control the economy.
It turns out that, in the case of communications technology, the ease of use and the wideness of its adoption are more important than the control desires of censors.  The reason that this is so is obvious.  If millions of people can easily do something, it is hard to stop them.  Governments can stop a few but that leaves thousands or millions of people still doing the forbidden thing.  Sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll proved that long ago.  In the case of the Nets, governments are faced with the problem of how to stop millions (soon billions) from hitting the Enter<--' key on their keyboards.  Big challenge.
Since totalitarianism turns out to be a non-stable state when individuals have physical power in the world, things continue to look difficult for the "They believe that the Government is the problem and that what everyone needs is to be told, 'You're on your own; go out there into the tender mercies of the global economy; have a great time in cyberspace, and we'll get out of your way.'" -- William Jefferson Blythe Clinton in a speech to the AFSCME in Chicago June 21, 1996.

Based on the 1911 Colt .45 auto pistol, and limited to a run of 100, the gun sells for $2495.00.  In addition to a lot of 2nd amendment commentary on the slide, the whole Bill of Rights are engraved on the artificial mother-of-pearl pistol grips.

"4th Arrest in Probe of Hijacker ID Fraud Man Accused of Helping
Suspects in Sept. 11 Terror Attacks Exploit Va. Loophole
By Patricia Davis and Brooke A. Masters
Washington Post Staff Writers
Friday, October 26, 2001; Page B09
A fourth person was arrested and charged yesterday with helping the
Sept. 11 hijackers illegally obtain Virginia identification cards less
than five weeks before the terrorist attacks.
Both civilians and officials seem to think that there is some magic
about a drivers license that would make it a good national ID and
requires that it be protected from misuse by unauthorized persons.
Apparently unknown to these worthies is the fact that terrorists,
criminals, or just plain folks can do anything they want to do without a
drivers license issued by a US state.
As surprising as it may seem, one can drive, rent cars, fly domestically
or internationally, get a job, start a business, rent accomodations,
open bank accounts, and do anything you like without a US drivers
Holders of foreign drivers licenses can drive in the US.
Among the four million US expats are many native born US citizens who
have an absolute right to enter, live, and work in the US but who do not
*currently* even have a right to obtain a US drivers license since they
are not *resident* in the US.  Any US citizens who care to can
characterize themselves as being in this group.
A drivers license issued by a US state is no more than evidence of
identity.  It is not evidence of right to reside in the US, right to
work in the US, etc.  One must use other documents to establish right to
reside and right to work (if those documents are required).  One can use
other documents to establish identity.  Including most significantly a
passport (whether foreign or domestic).
With 300 million US border crossings by aliens annually, it is clear
that plenty of aliens are travelling around the country almost none of
whom have drivers liccenses issued by a US state.
I hope that a "new, improved, drivers license" takes some of the heat
off the National ID concept.

A.D. 980-1016
It is always a temptation to an armed and agile nation
  To call upon a neighbour and to say:--
"We invaded you last night--we are quite prepared to fight,
  Unless you pay us cash to go away."
And that is called asking for Dane-geld,
  And the people who ask it explain
That you've only to pay 'em the Dane-geld
  And then  you'll get rid of the Dane!
It is always a temptation for a rich and lazy nation,
  To puff and look important and to say:--
"Though we know we should defeat you, we have not the
          time to meet you.
  We will therefore pay you cash to go away."
And that is called paying the Dane-geld;
  But we've  proved it again and  again,
That if once you have paid him the Dane-geld
  You never get rid of the Dane.
It is wrong to put temptation in the path of any nation,
  For fear they should succumb and go astray;
So when you are requested to pay up or be molested,
  You will find it better policy to say:--
"We never pay any-one Dane-geld,
  No matter how trifling the cost;
For the end of that game is oppression and shame,
  And the nation that pays it is lost!"

toll. Your account lists all the booths passed and when so it can be very
useful for law enforcement and civil attorneys (including domestic
relations lawyers). EZPass has already been featured on an episode of Law

In fact burglary is generally treated as a more serious crime than mere theft (the taking and asportation of the personal property of another) because it involves invasion of the home (at Common Law).  Though legislatures have expanded burglary to include businesses and even cars at Common Law it was "the breaking and entering of the dwelling house of another with intent to commit a felony therein."  It is serious because one may be vulnerable (asleep) at home and anyone criminal enough to break into your home is probably capable of doing very bad things.  It's quite a major breach of the duty of peace that we owe others (who haven't done anything to us).

programming language.  If you use a different programming language, the
code won't run.
Like most of our legal discussions here, morality is not at issue just
what opinions courts have expressed on various matters.
The US was, in fact, convicted of war crimes in '86 in a trial at the
International Court of Justice for air-sown mines in Nicaragua but nothing
came of it.
US treatment of those who formally declared war on it a half-dozen times
since 1996 and initiated hostilities is not likely to constitute that
entity's worst human rights violations.  Perhaps not a rights violation at
all in strict libertarian terms.
Libertarian penal theory has not been well developed.  Naturally we don't
favor sticking prisoners in utopian socialist colonies (prisons).  Slavery
to the victim or family is possible but difficult.  "The Market for
Liberty" suggested that crime would be so rare that shrinks would rent the
few prisoners as study subjects but I doubt that's very realistic.
There's always the payment of wergeld but the poor often can't pay.
Since torture or execution are not strictly prohibited by the
non-aggression axiom in the case of those who have agressed, there are
likely to be differences among libertarians on the treatment of prisoners.
Still an unresolved problem.

Eric's comment are correct.
A bit more info.  The US wanted to devalue the $ and substitute a general
gold standard for a government to government gold standard.  The gold
standard price of gold was $20.67/ounce.  By forcing Americans to turn in
their gold before devaluation, the Feds got more gold for less money.
They also wanted the freedom to inflate.  Gold clauses were common in
contracts and they would have made soft money difficult.
As is traditional under US law, gold ownership was banned for US citizens
and permanent residents anywhere on earth.  There were controlled
exemptions for coin collectors, jewelers, and dentists.
Gold smuggling became popular during the Vietnam war and the monetary
crises of the '60s and '70s.

Sept. 11 Hijackers Said to Fake Data on Bank Accounts
Sayeth the New York Times:
      July 10, 2002
      Sept. 11 Hijackers Said to Fake Data on Bank Accounts
      By JAMES RISEN
      WASHINGTON, July 9  The Sept. 11 hijackers were able to open
      35 American bank accounts without having legitimate Social
      Security numbers and opened some of the accounts with
      fabricated Social Security numbers that were never checked or
      questioned by bank officials, a senior F.B.I. official said
      today.
      ...
      With no scrutiny from the financial institutions or
      government regulators, the hijackers were able to move
      hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Middle East into
      the United States through a maze of bank accounts beginning
      more than a year before their attacks.
      A spokesman for SunTrust, which is based in Atlanta, said the
      bank had been cooperating with the F.B.I.'s investigation.
      The spokesman said it was possible for foreigners without
      Social Security numbers to open bank accounts in this
      country, but he could not provide details of what forms of
      identification the hijackers used to open the SunTrust
      accounts.
      ...
      One of the first signs of a large infusion of cash coming
      into the United States for use by the hijackers appears in
      bank records dating from 2000, when $100,000 was deposited in
      bank accounts controlled by some of the leading hijackers,
      including Mr. Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi, Mr. Lormel said.
      ...
Note that it is as legal as church on a Sunday for non-residents to open
financial accounts in the US or Switzerland or the UK etc. Many US banks
don't accommodate foreigners but that is because of sloth not law.
Certainly online brokers (who are quasi banks) do market to foreigners.
One reason that SS numbers were not verified is that the SSA has
traditionally refused to verify for privacy reasons and the alternative
method involves doing a credit check which takes time and money. And in
the case of non-interest-paying current accounts there are no tax issues.
Banks located in the "red states" are not as bureaucratic as banks in the
"blue states" and have been much slower to adopt the controls popular on
the coasts. This is changing of course but there are still many social
differences which make account transactions easier in the free states.
But let's assume for a moment that Homeland Security shuts the banks down
and requires verified DNA samples and licenses from 10 separate agencies
to open a financial account in the US. So the middle class Egyptians and
Saudis with no criminal records who attacked us are faced with the
ultimate challenge of getting the $500K they needed into the US.
By dint of heroic effort, the future highjackers manage to open bank
accounts in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. They receive ATM, debit, or credit
cards to draw on those accounts. Perhaps they encourage their French or
British co-conspirators to open accounts in those countries. They arrive
in the US and withdraw the $500 to $1000 per day maximum (per account)
from ATM machines. Assume they have only managed to open 5 accounts.
That's $2500 to $5000/day. Or 100 to 200 days to withdraw $500K. Not much
of a trick particularly since they are not limited to 5 accounts and can
get cash advances at any bank with any credit cards they have.
But then Homeland Security outlaws ATMs and credit cards (or at least the
international connections of same). This is tantamount to imposing
exchange controls which the US has never done. So the attackers have to
fall back on Krugerrands. At $333 a pop, they have to get 1500 KRs into
the country. Since bullion coins are not considered currency, they aren't
covered by financial instrument import reporting laws. But you can just
mail them one or two at a time. Most of them will get through. No big
The truth is that it's a bit tricky to block the movement of small
amounts of money like this.

Congressman Wants to Let Entertainment Industry Get Into Your Computer

I've been reading things like this for a while but I wonder how practical
such an attack would be. They won't be able to hack into computers with
reasonable firewalls and while they might try DOS attacks, upstream
connectivity suppliers might object. Under current P2P software they may
be able to do a little hacking but the opposition will rewrite the
software to block. DOS attacks and phony file uploads can be defeated
with digital signatures and reputation systems (including third party

Bookies in Exile
By WILLIAM BERLIND
Costa Rica is highly prized by the world's backpackers and sightseers for its unspoiled natural beauty, but it's easy to forget that when arriving in its grimy capital, San Jose. The newly remodeled airport is surrounded by chain hotels, freshly paved roads and shiny corporate plazas. After that it goes rapidly downhill. A dusty highway heading vaguely toward downtown takes you through the poorer suburbs of San Jose, packed with families in corrugated-tin-roof shacks. Above them, on the sides of the surrounding hills, Costa Rica's elite live behind high, fortified walls. The entire valley is blanketed with smog from auto fumes, brush fires and burned trash.
This Costa Rica doesn't make for much of a postcard, but to a small group of men, Americans mostly, it is alluring, enchanting and brimming with possibilities for adventure. The men are bookmakers taking bets and dispensing winnings over the Internet, and Costa Rica has exactly what they need -- a government that welcomes new investment in almost whatever form it takes, a well-developed business environment that makes it possible get phone lines hooked up and computer equipment serviced and a sizable English-speaking population capable of manning the phones and helping customers place their bets. Legal prostitution, as well as a plethora of strip clubs, seedy casinos and bars festooned with Budweiser signs, round out the atmosphere.
Betting operations are now among San Jose's most lucrative and visible enterprises, and their success has transformed the city. One prominent suburban landmark is an office building occupied by an outfit called BETonSPORTS.com. Throughout its nine floors, 1,500 Costa Ricans are employed (in mostly clerical positions) and offered amenities like on-site day care and classes to improve their English.
Most of the bookmaking companies, though, are a good deal smaller and harder to see, tucked away in strip malls and shadowy side streets. The American proprietors are generally in their 30's and 40's, and for them, the Internet provides not only the means to escape the reach of American law, but also a chance to turn what had been the equivalent back home of small, local shops -- sustained by personalized attention and all the headaches that involves -- into booming, virtual superstores that can rake in action from all over the world. The experiences of these men in Costa Rica, as well as of those elsewhere in Central America and the Caribbean, started out as thrilling adventures in what seemed to them like Las Vegas in the 1950's. But as betting operations multiplied, the offshore business has become hotly competitive and complicated. Worse, in recent years lawmakers and ambitious prosecutors back in the States have been mounting ever more serious legal challenges. Returning home to a normal life now means facing the possibility of going to prison. And so, many of the bookmakers who started out so optimistically are finding themselves locked into an isolated way of life that with each passing day seems a worse bet.

New York-AP -- In New York, police are looking into the shooting of an unarmed African immigrant by a plainclothes police officer.
The immigrant, Ousmane Zango (ooz-mahn ZHAHN'-goh), was shot four times after a winding chase through the hallways of a storage unit in Chelsea.
The plainclothes police officer had been guarding counterfeit merchandise down the hall from Zango's unit.
Police Commissioner Ray Kelly says two storage rooms had recently been raided by Staten Island officers investigating a compact disc counterfeiting operation. But Zango had no connection to that operation and no criminal record.
