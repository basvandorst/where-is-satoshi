One might wonder how Dorothy's opinions about privacy et al would change were it *her* communications/privacy/person at risk (be it through torture, GAK, etc.).
Were a government - duly elected - to come into power similar to that in 30's Germany or 70's Viet Nam, so that intellectuals or the educated became the targets of oppression, would she be as adamant about the perceived "rights" of Government to intrude in her private life, monitor her communications, and so on?
Inquiring minds want to know.... :-)

Okay, so are they going to encrypt the email, or should I go ahead and make arrangements to steal a message :-)

@_subject: TLA abuse (?) [non-crypto, mostly] 
Hmmmm. Got a call this morning from a Mike Hughes of the Amarillo PD (APD). Seems they've received "several" complaints about the anti-CDA image on my home page ( Supposedly, it's not the nudity they complainer(s) is(are) all riled up about: it's the age of the models that's being questioned.
Hardcopy of said image has been forwarded to the FBI for 'review'.
Officer (sorry, don't recall his rank) Hughes says *he* thinks the models could conceivably be 18; a judge they showed it to said _she_ thought (personal opinion) younger. Hence, the forwarding to FBI for quasi-official determination.
Officer Hughes going to stop by so I can show him:
        A - that the page is PICS rated
        B - the original of the image :-)
        C - the precautions that PWS takes to warn folks about possibly offensive content.
I don't plan to change the image, so if anyone can point me in the general direction of some Legal Assistance (tm), I'd appreciate it.

Krazy glue _will_ glue fingers, if applied properly. I proved this to a
fellow sailor in 1976 by gluing his thumb and forefinger around a JP-5 vent
pipe aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise. Some folks might want to try liquid latex, contact adhesive, silicon sealers
(RTV), or similar products. Soft, flexible, relatively convenient when
applied, and can be 'layered' to the desired thickness. Liquid latex can
usually be found in hobby/craft stores.

I would also suggest that the generation of OTP 'pads' for users is *highly* questionable. Who else is getting a copy of them, assuming they're even valid?

@_subject: Paradox db passwords/encryption 
Sorry to disturb everyone, but I've got a questions that is (gasp!) immediately related to crypto:
Does anyone have any info on the encryption used in the Paradox (4.5 for Win) database? I've got someone that has an encrypted (well, password-protected :-) Paradox database that needs some maintenance, and the person that knew the password is now - shall we say - 'no longer with them'. Right now, doesn't matter if it's something clever, or a brute-force hack; they just need to get into the tables and such.
