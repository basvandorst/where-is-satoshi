@_subject: NSA museum now open, if you can find it 
It's named after Friendship Airport which is not called
Baltimore-Washington Interntional Airport which these buildings are
very close to.
I believe you can get on a mailing list for these posters free.  Try
calling NSA and asking for M56 or "Security Awareness".
The bureaucracy in the Federal Government makes this sort of thing
very messy.
