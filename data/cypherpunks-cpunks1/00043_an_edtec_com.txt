@_subject: One-Time Pads as Attack Method 
1. Agents of the Enemy wish to create the appearance of you possessing
document A.
2. They obtain some artifact you have emailed, or posted, or possess on
your private local storage. ---
Possibly even signed.  Call this message B.
3. They create the XOR of A and B, the result being a 'one time pad' C.
which of course, gives:
private message B XOR C = target bogus message A.  This result is of course
not a one time pad;
the plan is to accuse you of possessing materials that prove you are
trading with the enemy,
exchanging kiddie-porn, any of the usual things.
4. This 'one time pad' file C. somehow finds its way into your possession:
it is an email attachment,
embedded in some binary --- it could even be stego'ed into a GIF/JPG.
5. The agents break down the door and seize all your effects.  6. They are able to prove that you possess B and C, the XOR of which is A.,
a fact that is impossible
to have happened at random.
7. The jury doesn't know shit, and figures that if the chances of B ^ C = A
by accident are 0,
then you must be guilty.
I'm only looking at the general schema of an attack like this: I'm sure
there are many ways
the right defense could be mounted about how the files got on the client's
computer, etc.etc.
The interesting part of this frame-job is using something you may have
already publicly posted,
making denial of its origin difficult, together with a surreptitious
planting of the 'pad' data.
Naturally the incriminating data payload could be delivered directly,
without the OTP business.
But I thought it might be worth examining the implications of this theme.

Your response is most interesting!  It almost implies you can't publish
for(i=0;i < filesize(B); i++) C[i] = A[i] ^ file_contents[i];
I wonder why the difficulty in simply (I thought of actually going ahead and doing this):
Take a posting (B.) to cpunks by Tim May.  THese get disseminated quite
widely and he's well-known; his thoughts and style should make deniability
of the message difficult.
Calculate C = B ^ A such that A = kiddie porn of your choice.
Post the UUENCODE of C. to cypherpunks, send the binary to Tim, etc.
Call your favorite Agency to investigate.
Your variant in which the file B. is known, as in KRNL386.EXE is also viable,
if not more so!
Is posting a TRANSFORM such as a 'OTP' that converts copyrighted material A
into copyrighted material B a violation of anything, I wonder...  You could
convert everybody's Internet Explorer into a ZIP file containing a setup
and executable for Netscape 3.0!!

Microsoft has been involved for some time with smart-card keyboard readers,
and I think some of my cohorts have seen the prototypes (I have not).
I figure strong authentication will become part of the the platform within
somewhere between 6 and 18 months.  With Intel putting crypto on the main board / CPU,
this poses very important issues --- it does not give me a warm fuzzy feeling.
I haven't heard anything about this rumor.  However, if you look at
the new USB chips being built by Cypress et al, it's not hard to
imagine keyboards with ISO smart card readers built in.  The USB chips
contain a simple RISC core, lots of I/O pins and something like 4-8KB
of FLASH or OTP memory.  The incremental cost is a slot with 6
contacts for the smart card.  Unlike PCMCIA, the ISO smart cards are
cheap to build and easy to interface to.  Schmlumberger is currently
promoting it's "CryptoFlex" card which can do 1024-bit RSA sigs as
well as triple-DES.  I believe that it can do a 1024-bit sig in
something like 20 ms.
