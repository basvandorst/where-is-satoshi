@_subject: When anyone can publish, who's a journalist now? 
Hash: SHA1
What about (fully recognised and published) part-time journalists?  I
have a monthly column in a trade magazine.  It takes up about 2% of my
working time.  What protection should that material have and,
considering that they are compiled using the same systems, how does
that affect the 98% of my work which is as a security consultant?
Actually, as I am a Brit, there is no protection at all but consider
the hypothetical case.
