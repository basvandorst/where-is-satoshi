DOD IPv6 director arrested for possession of child porn
04/06/06 -- 03:54 PM
By Patience Wait,
A high-ranking Defense Department IT official has been arrested and
indicted on child pornography charges.
Charles Lynch, director of the Defense Information Systems Agencybs
Internet Protocol version 6 transition program, was arrested March 8
and indicted in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia the next day on one count of possessing child pornography.
According to a statement by the DOD Inspector Generalbs Office, court
documents allege that Lynch had been operating a peer-to-peer file-
sharing program on a computer in his office at DISA. Agents
confiscated several computers and more than 1,000 CDs from Lynchbs
office. Agents found child pornography in computer file folders, the
IGbs statement said.
Lynch, 44, is on leave without pay from DISA. If convicted, he faces
up to 10 years in prison.
The investigation is being conducted by the Defense Criminal
Investigative Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the
DISA OIG. Officials with those agencies, as well as the U.S.
Attorneybs Office, declined to comment on the ongoing investigation.
In apparently unrelated cases, a Homeland Security Department
official was arrested earlier this week for soliciting sex over the
Internet with a minor. And last week, federal agents seized computer
equipment from the desk of a NASA official March 29, based on
information developed during a U.S. Postal Inspection Service
undercover investigation of Internet trafficking in child pornography.
