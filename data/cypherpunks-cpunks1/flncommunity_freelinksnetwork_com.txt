Submit your ideas, tips and information to MyInput at AEOpublishing.com I received notice of a new virus last week, and didn't pay much attention until I started receiving copies. Just thought others might like a heads up or more information about this.
It's called the SirCam virus, and when it spreads, it sends an apparently random file from the harddrives of infected computers along with it. ANY file on your machine could be copied and sent to hundreds of other users. In some
cases that could be simply embarassing. In others, depending
on the contents of the file, it could be quite costly.
The files I've gotten have ranged from 200k to slightly over 300k.
For more info check out:  at mm.html
and For a fix, visit   for a trial download that will clean it out.

Top Ten Most Important Things to Do Today
By Michael E. Angier
This is my list. They're the ones I've selected for my life at

entertaining--preferably all three.

Forget About The Cow, Brand The Customer!
When you think of branding, the first thing that must come to mind is a farmer taking a hot iron and burning a distinctive   mark onto the side of a cow.  Farmers do this so that their   cows will not be confused with another farmer's cows.  But branding has evolved over the years and has now become a common term used in marketing.  Branding is essentially burning your company or web site name or slogan into the minds of potential customers.  Many offline companies have been quite successful in doing this.  Kleenex is a brand name for tissue as is Band-Aid for adhesive bandages.  These companies have incorporated into the customer's mind to perceive these items by their brand name.  Branding is important on the Internet, especially with all the cut-throat competition.    In the real world, it may be just a matter of convenience   why some people shop at a closer discount store than going that extra mile to the next discount store.  But on the Internet, any web site is just a click away.  You need to differentiate   yourself from the rest.  Branding can create this difference.  One of the most important decisions when it comes to branding is deciding the domain name that you want to use.  You want to pick a name that is short and snappy that will "stick" into the minds of visitors and potential customers.  I remember about a year ago, a few Internet marketers were   making a huge hoopla about the domain names that allowed you to have 67 characters.  This fad has died down because people are not going to remember long names such as:    People find it easy to retain short URL's such as yahoo.com,   snap.com or eBay.com.  You should pick a name that is short and yet at the same time will give a potential visitor an idea as to what you are all about.  For example, if you pick a name such as  people will automatically associate your name with automobiles and oil.  Branding can be also used in slogans.  I bet you can pick out   these companies real quick:  1. "Quality is Job 1."  2. "Finger-lickin' good."  3. "The milk chocolate melts in your mouth - not in your hand."  4. "Have it your way."  5. "It keeps going, and going, and going..."  If you guessed Ford, KFC, M & M's, Burger King, and Energizer,   then you probably understand the importance of branding.  If you decide to use a slogan for your web site, researchers   have suggested that rhymes are easy to remember.  For example:  "We are number one, because we like to have fun..."  Okay, that was kind of cheesy.  But you get the point. ;)  Another method of branding is with your online classified ads.   If you use consistent headlines and words in your ads, then   customers will be able to identify the ad to your web site or   company very quickly when they see it again.  Statistics indicate that customers need to see an online   advertisement at least seven times before they will buy.  If you   are constantly changing your ads for no valid reason, you may be losing your identity with potential customers.  One of the best books written on online branding is "Revenge of Brand X", written by Rob Frankel.  Rob really goes in depth about branding and his book covers a lot of detail.  You can purchase a copy by going to:    The Internet has created a level playing field for all   competitors.  Competitors need to differentiate themselves to win the customer.  A good brand name translates into a bigger market share on the Internet.  A bigger market share means larger sales and bigger profits.  Now forget about cows when it comes to branding and get   moooooooooooooooving... I know, I know, that was even more cheesy.    Copyright 2001 Gauher Chaudhry, All Rights Reserved.

I don't know, maybe it's just me, but it seems the KISS formula has been tossed out the window. I visit various sites that are supposed to be selling a product or service and get various messages such as: version of IE or Netscape and we'd like to ask you to upgrade your browser at this time. Explorer. flash media software. our site. Well I have to admit I'm out of there when it comes to any of these sites. If I'm looking for a product or service and you want my money, don't ask me to jump through hoops to hand it to you. I'm not visiting your site so I can spend the rest of the night adding plug ins, upgrading browsers and being told I'm not welcome unless I do a "dog and pony" show for you. Maybe I'm wrong, but web surfers have a limited attention span when it comes to making a buying decision and I really don't think they're coming to be impressed by your site. They're stopping by to see if you have what they want, need or desire. I'm sure many of these sites are making nice sales, but how many more are they losing? There are sites with a sales letter and maybe one or two graphics making sales around the clock. You stop by, see what they have to offer, and either you buy or you don't. They're saying, "Hey come as you are, you're always welcome." I know that there are a lot of goodies out there to impress visitors with, but I'd rather feel comfortable and welcome. If you expect me to spend my money make it easy. I'm not looking to spend the rest of the night making upgrades and changing browsers etc. so I can hand you my money. I may be old fashioned, but if you want my money, make me feel comfortable. I don't need to be told I have to change to hand you my money. I'm actually glad there are so many sites I can't view, it saves me money. Copyright (c) 2001 John Colanzi.

"NOTHING BUT NET"
This is the success story of one guy working out of his parent's basement, who went from 0 to $750,000 in sales in his first year on the internet. No traditional advertising of any kind was used, not even a business card. He moved real world products without even so much as a physical store. Now you'll be able to use the same powerful internet marketing tactics he used. To find out even more:
 You are a member in at least one of these programs - You should be in them all!              Doin' It, Doin' It, Doin' It... and the only thing worse than a bad ad campaign
Dumber than a doornail - that's what he was - one of the richest home-
based businessmen I have ever had the opportunity to know personally. For purposes of anonymity, lets call him Jack. Jack wasn't your typical sharp-as-a-tack businessman, nor was he what you might term a master marketer. Actually, he wasn't really even all that bright. He was one of those types that, though he dressed nicely, when he opened his mouth, you would grit your teeth hoping he wouldn't say something terribly foolish or offensive. About seven years ago, Jack approached my husband and me about providing a certain service for his expansive downline in a network marketing company. While we were not interested in network marketing, nor did we believe we would gain a significant number of customers through this business relationship, Jack convinced us to provide this service for his organization. What followed blew our minds. Once we had all things set up and customized to begin taking orders, Jack made an announcement to his downline. The orders immediately began to trickle in. Jack sent out reminders for several weeks. The orders came by the thousands. We had to hire more employees to take Jack's orders. Every month, orders increased and business was booming. Through many meetings over the next few months, we got to know Jack. One of his associates had put together a fairly unattractive executive summary for all distributors to use. We offered to redo it free of charge. Jack declined and said he wanted it up right away... as is. Surely, even not-so-bright Jack could see the importance of reworking this document that thousands of distributors would be using. Nevertheless, the executive summary went out "as is." We felt sure it would backfire. But, do you know that things actually picked up faster soon after it was distributed? My husband and I scratched our heads as we wondered what in the world Jack knew that we didn't. What was so fantastic about Jack that he could have such influence over so many people. He said, "Jump," and thousands of people asked, "How high?" Why? Jack invited us to accompany him to a conference he was putting together. We were to present our services to his audience. My husband and I went and took a small sales force with us. During Jack's lectures, we left our booth to peek in every so often. Throughout that whole three-day conference, I never heard Jack say anything of real consequence. Yes, there was a lot of hype, but there wasn't anything truly solid to the information he presented. In fact, Jack would inevitably say something, quite frankly, stupid right in the middle of his lectures. Yet, at Jack's suggestion, people continued to sign up for our services in droves. It wasn't until the end of the conference that we figured out what it was that made Jack so successful. Do you know what the secret to his success was? He actually practiced what he preached. You see, Jack understood two things quite well. 1) He knew that to get a desired outcome, he had to actually DO something to get there. 2) He understood the exponential power of leveraging. Each person in that room that he could get to DO something to work toward his goal would exponentially get him there that much faster. For purposes of this article, we're only going to take a look at the first item above... doing something. During those three days, Jack must have used the phrase, "Doin' It, Doin' It, Doin' It," several dozen times. It really was quite annoying. But, it didn't sink in until the end of the conference what he was trying to teach his audience... That if they would just do something - anything - every day toward their goals, they would get there. It's so simple, it sounds ridiculous. Yet, that is exactly what not-so-
bright Jack did to get to his millions. He just started doing something. He didn't wait until he had enough money to start his business (he started flat broke with a young family). He didn't wait until the executive summary was perfect, nor did he wait until his company had a whole slew of products to sell. He knew where he wanted to be, simply started with what he had and DID SOMETHING - every day. How does the saying go? "The road to hell is paved with good intentions." How about this one, "You can't wish your way into heaven." This is equally true of business dreams. A dream is nothing more than a dream until you do something to make it a reality. The plain and simple truth is that you can't wish your way to riches. You've got to do something about it. The problem most of us face is that, though we have an idea of what ultimate outcome we want, the process of getting there seems overwhelming. Taking off bite-size pieces each day is a much better way of getting there. And... it works! Not-so-bright Jack is living proof of this principle. Trust me, my saying that if Jack can do it, anyone can, is not just some trite phrase. Okay, let's take a break for a short quiz. Q: Do you know what's worse than a bad sales aid? A: No sales aid at all. You know, my husband and I feel like we really missed out on something at that conference. What did we miss out on? Opportunity. Sure, we took in plenty of orders. But, on our way home in the plane, we both realized that if we had taken one sales aid (a piece of equipment that would help those people with the service we were offering), we would have sold 100's of them at a $100 profit each. We wouldn't have had to stock any inventory or purchase the equipment up front. We just needed to provide the sample piece of equipment, an order form for taking orders, and then have them drop-shipped in order for us to have pocketed an additional $10,000 to $20,000 in those three days. It wouldn't have made a huge difference how perfectly formatted our order forms were. Simply having an order form - any order form - would have sold plenty. This is a concept that not-so-bright Jack understood very well. He was anxiously engaged in "doin' it, doin' it, doin' it," and in the process made his millions. We have tried to take Jack's advice over the years. It takes time and experience to come to understand the significance of this simple concept... doing something every day. His advice has made and is making a difference in our own business. Now, ask yourself if there is something you have thought about doing but have put off, a wish you would like... no... NEED to make a reality. Do you have an eBook you have been wanting to write but are afraid you won't have the time to finish before the market is saturated? Perhaps you are waiting to perfect it before releasing it? Are you afraid you won't know how to market it? Have you joined a company as a distributor, read over the materials, but just haven't brought yourself to making a call or two? Have you wanted to put up a website for your products or services, but the task seems too daunting or too expensive? Is there a business you would really like to start but are afraid of failure? Perhaps you feel you don't have the capital to get it going? If so, I challenge you to start now, today, to write down your desired outcome and make it a goal. Then, do something - anything toward that goal every day. Don't wait for perfect circumstances. Don't wait for the ideal sales aid. Don't wait for the money. Don't let self-doubt, fear, time-wasters or money keep you from doing some little thing each day. You may still have your doubts and fears, but by doing something every day and seeing your progress over time, you will soon find your doubts and fears fading away. Whether it be a simple phone call, an email, trading links, writing a few words, sketching an idea; do something every day. You will be surprised at the results. And, if you've got a few more smarts than not-so-bright Jack, you might just make an extra million or two.

 You are a member in at least one of these programs - You should be in them all!              5 Ways to Create a Unique Website
Internet users have no doubt seen several websites of identical
design. This is often because webmasters do not have the
ability or time to design and create unique websites. These
five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind design
for your website.
1. Navigation System
Deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first
things to consider when designing your website. Visitors
usually look for a way to get to the information they want
before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your
navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase ( for example. There is a list of categories on the left, and information about the network on the top bar.
It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the
bottom of the page because:
- People see the top of the page first
- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation gets
   pushed to bottom of the page... away from the visitor.
2. Color Scheme
When you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast. For
example, do not use bright green and florescent pink. Some
colors that are often used are white on black or black on
A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color Schemer
( created by Aaron
Epstein. Many other programs exist that can assist you in
choosing colors. Try doing a search on FreewareFiles ( Tucows (
or Download.com ( for "color schemer."
3. Content Window
This is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text here
is easy to read and understand.
Also, provide your own original content. People do not want to
hear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear what you want to say! While it might be time consuming to write
your own content, it sure is worth it.
To find content for your website, try searching at
EzineArticles ( Other people may
have used the articles, but if you become good friends with the
authors, they may send you new content as they write it. Be
careful though. Do not use too much content from other authors, as mentioned above.
4. Font(s)
Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is
fixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New.
Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.)
Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to
Arial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can be used for long pieces of text.
The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,
or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times
(Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif,
is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because
its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making it
easier to read.
5. Advertising
Ah, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing that almost every website has. The most common type is what is known as "banner" advertising. It is called that because it is long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long you ask? The generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.
New sizes however are being used. Take for example the new
style called "skyscraper" -- so called for a reason: it looks
like a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not too
wide (about 100-125 pixels.)
Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the page.
Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in the middle
of the page, at the bottom, or along the side.
    Conclusion
These are only five things to consider when designing a
website. There are many others however. Let me know what you find that helps you create a unique website. My email address is mailto:corbb at justforwebmasters.com.
