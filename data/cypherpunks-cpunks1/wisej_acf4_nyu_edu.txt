Ah, but they are, on mac anyways...pop open ResEdit (available from ftp.apple.com or in most book stores or development packages), choose 'get file/folder info' from the file menu, and pick any directory in a standard dir/file browser which comes up.  When the info box comes up, just click in the 'invisible' box.  When u exit ResEdit, it will ask u if u want to save changes.  Click 'yes', and...voila...an invisible subdirectory.  Many programs make this interface even easier, too.

You'd be surprised.  For example, Plaintalk, a system extension bundled with the
AV-series macintoshes, does voice recognition based solely on phonemes.  Although it is not perfect yet, I can personally attest to having walked up to a
model on display in a store, tried a few simple commands by voice, and had no problem with recognition.  The technology _is_ there.

While it is not censorship as such, it rather seems against our stated goals as cypherpunks to advocate such filtering...not because of what it blocks from our own sites, but it _does_ affect those downstream.  To give an example of why this is important, last July (June?) the University of Canterbury in Christchurch New Zealand began filtering all alt.sex.* newspostings from their site.  Well this in itself was perhaps harmless, the topology of NZ's corner of the net is such that as a result _all_ net-sites in the entire of NZ's South Island lost these newsgroups.  While I'm not saying that the University were outside of their rights, we must keep the wider issues in view at all times.
Another key point is that we not let our own personal feelings interfere with our political actions.  I'm sure most of us here were offended by the suggestions in the heat of the anonymity debate that all anonymous postings to newsgroups be killed...yet here are cypherpunks advocating the filtering of all Detweiler and Detweiler-seeming posts.  Sure, the guy's a prick, but should we let him turn us into fascists?

In a society where anonymity were commonly available, I would agree withyou, but
sadly we do not live in such a society.  As cypherpunks we are trying to rectify
this, to make anonymity available for _all_, pricks like Detweiler included.  I think that it sets a bad precedent to boot him off of our private remailers while our remailers are still all that's out there.  When public remailing is a reality, we can rightly do as we see fit with our private remailers without risking jeopardizing the future of anonymity rights on the net as a whole.
Understand of course, that I am not saying that you have no right to boot Detweiler...I am merely pointing out that I think it would set a dangerous precedent, and would in the long run be detrimental to all we are working for.

But the best way to keep it legal is to keep it widely available, no questions asked...If each person is providing their own brand of anonymity, it sort of destroys the point, doesn't it?  After all, you just look to see whose remailing
style is being used.
