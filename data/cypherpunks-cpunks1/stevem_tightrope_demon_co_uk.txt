@_subject: Advertising Creepiness 
I particularly dislike articles that are things forwarded from other
lists without comment (IP seems a particular offender here).  These are
rarely interesting.
Click through rates are something like 2%, so most are screening them out.
I rarely noticed what the ads actually said.
I don't know which ones you have tried but junkbuster  (a proxy on port 8000)
works _very_ well on my linux system, particularly with the "blank gif"
It blanks out 99% of banner gifs, which makes pages like metacrawler and
wired look more visually attractive and load faster.
Until I lost all the banner ads I hadn't realised how distracting all those
animated gifs at the top of the screen were and its now much faster and
easier to read the info you want, without them.
I tried this but found it made the net too hard to use.
It would give a brave browser manufactor (Opera?) quite an advantage if
they built the banner ad killer into the browser directly.

I assume you are refering to the meeting at Cambridge University that
you chaired.
My subjective impressions of that meeting were that PZ was certainly
sincere.  I seem to recall he told us that he was unware NAI had even
orginally been a member of KRA until he was telephoned by a journalist
in his car and was opposed to this.  Presumably this was before NAI
bought TIS and rejoined (?)
I would add an option
(4) PZ didn't know -- cockup not conspiracy
But all this leads to a lack of confidence in the future of the PGP product,
which is too precious to be left in the hands of one (American) company,
whose policy is in doubt.
I  am not currently convinced by their actions that NAI are
serious about strong crypto and I believe that a truly free and open
version of PGP (GPG?) would be superior.

lupulin ... I had a friend who claimed to get stoned off smoking hops
and hop extract.
There were inaccurate claims dating back to at least the 60s that hops
could be crossed with hemp to produce a psychoactive plant similar to
the recent Orange hoax.

no in a free market there is no state
there are laws based on natural rights

whoever in a market by the division of labour finds it profitable will
write and enforce the laws
see David Friedman's
for an explanation of how private courts and police could work
"Natural Law theory rests on the insight... that each entity has
distinct and specific properties, a distinct "nature", which can be
investigated by man's reason"  -- Murray N. Rothbard thats how economic thinking starts, or rather should start, and then
the economy is an array of these individual transactions..
police and courts provide a "middle man" function, so you would need
three participants

government is a special form of social institution, one which has a self
declared monopoly on force and is immoral.
'fair competition' is any competition that doesn't involve political
force or breaking contracts.

Investigators find "assassination" page on the Web

   Portland, Oregon (AP) -- Three Internal Revenue Service agents and a
   federal magistrate are the targets on what's described as an Internet
   "assassination" Web page.
   All four have prices on their heads -- in unusual amounts like 512
   dollars and two cents.
   IRS investigators think it was posted by a patient in a federal mental
   hospital.
   The page is thought to be from an essay called "Assassination
   Politics." That essay -- written by a jailed tax protester --
   describes a supposedly risk-free way to reward those who assassinate
   public officials.
   Anyone who wants to see someone killed contributes to a fund which --
   when large enough -- attracts a killer who predicts the date, time and
   location for the deed to be done.
   If it happens, the killer is paid with untraceable digital money.

Not easier technically but "easier" maybe politically.
Key length seems to be held (probably wrongly) as a rough measure
of crypto "strength" by journos and those in power.
40bit RC4 is weak.  How strong would 56bit RC4 be?

I get "Received signal 10." after entering my pass phrase when

Has anyone got it to work?
