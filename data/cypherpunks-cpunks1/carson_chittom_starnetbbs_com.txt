To all:
        I have a deep interest in my privacy, and, therefore, in cryptography.
However, I do not know the slightest thing about encryption.  Could anyone
recommend any sources that would be understandable?  Ideally, I'd like to
have books, but I can bum off a friend's account if necessary (mine is an
e-mail only deal).  Many thanks.
