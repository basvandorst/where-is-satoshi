Owner arrested in Ireland, FBI makes extradition request, malicious

Tor-based internet host 'Freedom Hosting' has been arrested in Ireland and
charged with distributing and promoting child pornography on the internet,
 the Independent.

the Tor network. These services can range from everything from anonymous
email and library services, to online marketplaces for drug distribution
and the production and exchange of child pornography.
As this is part of an ongoing FBI investigation, there is no conclusive
evidence that the injection of this JavaScript is the result of a
government operation, however, this does fall under a known pattern of FBI

The execution of malicious JavaScript inside the Tor Browser Bundle,
perhaps the most commonly used Tor client, comes as a surprise to many
users. Previously, the browser disabled JavaScript execution by default for
security purposes, however this change was recently reverted by developers
in order to make the product more useful for average internet users. As a
result, however, the applications has become vastly more vulnerable to
attacks such as this*. *
What's going to happen next?Although it is difficult to gauge the size of
the anonymous internet, Freedom Hosting did seem to be perhaps the largest
anonymous web host, and its compromise will have serious implications for
the future of Tor hidden services.
We expect there will be a deeper technical analysis of the malware in the
coming days as security researchers examine it in greater detail. Since the
attack was designed at Firefox for Windows, which the Tor Browser Bundle is
based upon, it seems likely that this is not a random occurance, and that
the malware is designed specifically designed to compromise the identities

This is a small, unfinished idea I had, but I'd be interested in hearing
any feedback anybody here might have to offer. Normally we talk about
cryptography to secure communications, but this is an idea rather about
verifying the authenticity of media.
[Quick backround: OpenWatch  is a global citizen
media network using mobile phones as the basis for a free worldwide press.
We care very much about the authenticity of citizen media, and have
designed some systems
which attempt to
improve the verifiability of citizen media.]
The problem is that sometimes media artifacts are presented as a record of
a current event, when in fact they from different events. An example of
this was when images of a marathon race in Istanbul were presented as
the recent Occupy Gezi protests.
Now, imagine the globe divided into a grid coordinate system, say 100,000
units (or perhaps 232, if IP rather than physical address is to be used).
Based on their physical location, reporters can contact a server and are
assigned a key with which to sign or encrypt their media to. This then ties
a media object to a physical space. This can be further improved to include
both time and space by dividing a space-day into a number of units, suppose
1440, such that different keys would be handed out at different times of
the day, thus further tying a document to a moment in time as well.
Does anybody know if any systems like this have ever been discussed or
designed in the past? I suppose this is somewhat similar to the RSA-keyfob
system, although this allows for anonymous access without pre-arrangement
as well.

@_subject: Geotemporal Public Key Distribution 
I'm familiar with J3M, but unfortunately none of the current J3M/informacam
techniques actually work, as they have no _external_ verifiability. There
isn't actually any information which ties the media to a place or a time,
it's just information encoded into data which could be applied to any
document at any time. By factoring the network, a geotemporal pkey system
would address this problem. J3M is good for tying information to a specific
device (sort of) - but not to a place or a time.

@_date: 2013-08-26 17:34:07
@_author: Rich Jones 
@_subject: Geotemporal Public Key Distribution 
Yeah, with J3M, it relies on the user to supply their own sensor data,
which is obviously problematic if the use case is to prevent forgery (if
it's just for archival purposes, it works fine.) With a networked system,
the location would be determined from the traffic source or similar.

The purpose is to prevent forgery of documents. Actually, even more
fundamentally, it is a way of saying "I was at this place at this time" - I
don't believe there is any system which can do better than that (any kind
of device-based fingerprinting would be a DRM scheme, and therefore flawed
from conception.)
I don't believe that these documents could be made to be self-verifying,
although this is the sort of attempt being made with J3M.
to make documents network-verifiable against retroactive forgery,
but this is actually a different problem ("have we seen this before" rather
than "where in spacetime was this created").
Let's suppose a use case. Seems like we're about to have a nice little war
in Syria, so let's use that. Suppose a citizen reporter creates an image of
a bombed-out orphanage for impoverished nuns. Al-Jazeera wants to run with
it, but can it be trusted? How do we know that this is actually an image
from 2013 Syria, and not a previously-unpublished image from 2011 Libya,
uploaded by a military agent?
A geokey system would use network properties to assure that regions of
spacetime have unique identifiers. These identifiers could then be tied to
media, with a network protocol or J3M or something similar. Ideally, the
handing out of these cryptographic identifiers would actually be done via
satellite and not IPv4, as spatial IPv4 allocation isn't always accurate,
especially with mobile phones. Also, the thought of there being
geostationary microsats for the sole purpose of providing cryptographic
spacetime assurances just gives me the sci-fi tinglies. Imagine little
crypto robot oracles wizzing through space, beeping out random zeros and
ones back down onto the planet!
I guess the best we can do with this system is just narrow the "forgery
surface" to people who are at a certain place at a certain time who have
also preconspired to construct forgeries based on the keys generated by the
oracle. This is not perfect, but it's better than nothing - assuming that
we keep this limitation in mind.

techniques actually work, as they have no _external_ verifiability. There
isn't actually any information which ties the media to a place or a time,
it's just information encoded into data which could be applied to any
document at any time. By factoring the network, a geotemporal pkey system
would address this problem. J3M is good for tying information to a specific
device (sort of) - but not to a place or a time.

Yeah, with J3M, it relies on the user to supply their own sensor data,
which is obviously problematic if the use case is to prevent forgery (if
it's just for archival purposes, it works fine.) With a networked system,
the location would be determined from the traffic source or similar.

The purpose is to prevent forgery of documents. Actually, even more
fundamentally, it is a way of saying "I was at this place at this time" - I
don't believe there is any system which can do better than that (any kind
of device-based fingerprinting would be a DRM scheme, and therefore flawed
from conception.)
I don't believe that these documents could be made to be self-verifying,
although this is the sort of attempt being made with J3M.
to make documents network-verifiable against retroactive forgery,
but this is actually a different problem ("have we seen this before" rather
than "where in spacetime was this created").
Let's suppose a use case. Seems like we're about to have a nice little war
in Syria, so let's use that. Suppose a citizen reporter creates an image of
a bombed-out orphanage for impoverished nuns. Al-Jazeera wants to run with
it, but can it be trusted? How do we know that this is actually an image
from 2013 Syria, and not a previously-unpublished image from 2011 Libya,
uploaded by a military agent?
A geokey system would use network properties to assure that regions of
spacetime have unique identifiers. These identifiers could then be tied to
media, with a network protocol or J3M or something similar. Ideally, the
handing out of these cryptographic identifiers would actually be done via
satellite and not IPv4, as spatial IPv4 allocation isn't always accurate,
especially with mobile phones. Also, the thought of there being
geostationary microsats for the sole purpose of providing cryptographic
spacetime assurances just gives me the sci-fi tinglies. Imagine little
crypto robot oracles wizzing through space, beeping out random zeros and
ones back down onto the planet!
I guess the best we can do with this system is just narrow the "forgery
surface" to people who are at a certain place at a certain time who have
also preconspired to construct forgeries based on the keys generated by the
oracle. This is not perfect, but it's better than nothing - assuming that
we keep this limitation in mind.
