@_subject: THOUGHT:  International Electronic Declaration of Rights 
Hi everyone.  This is a fairly involved piece, so forgive me if I ramble a bit.
I just finished reading Sterling's The Hacker Crackdown, and one of the statements he said in there struck a chord with me and got me to thinking.
Paraphrasing, Bruce said soemthing along the lines of 'Cyberspace is a world unto itself, without borders or national identity.'  Why is this Because at the same time we are witnessing the birth of Cyberspace (an archaic, and almost vulgar term, yet also most appropriate), we are also witnessing a terrifying and growing movement towards the heavy-handed regulation of this new world. In cyberspace, national borders are merely annoyances on the Information
Superhighway, much like that one pothole you manage to hit every morning
on your way to work or school.  Yet, as the information future comes into
existance, governments will seek to put up checkpoints and roadblocks to
make sure information does not propogate. Thus, I had a thought.
What if we took it upon ourselves to write an International Electronic Declaration of Rights?  A single body of ideas (not necessarily founded upon the U.S. Bill of Rights) that will seek to define the underlying tone of this non-existant cyberspace.  It would have to be no more that a few statements about what ideals and freedoms we feel are not only important, but also granted to us on the basis of being living beings.
Hang on, don't run away yet. :-)
What to do with it, you ask?  How do we get a bunch of geek-written libertarian ideals to mean somehting?
Well, assuming we come up with our Electrion Declaration of Rights, the next step would be to get various civil-liberty organizations (such as EFF, ACLU, CPSR, and others outside the US) to sign on as supporters.  Then we pitch it to corporations and universities world-wide, and get them to sign on.  Soon, public pressure would force governments to look at it as a Rights issue, and perhaps we get it adopted as bodies of law or some such (a UN resolution?).
Ok ok, I'm _obviously_ getting quite ahead of myself, and I apologize.
But think about it, I do not know of a single resolution or declaration of the rights a citizen of Cyberspace is granted.  Yes, each country has their own rules, but cyberspace doesn't understand the concept of borders, and perhaps it never will.
Furthermore, there is precedent for International declarations of this sort.  The United Nations has a Declaration of Human Rights (ftp.eff.org :/pub/CAF/civil-liberty/human-rights.un) [Note, though, that I avoided the use of the term 'human' above' for reasons that any avid sci-fi reader should recognize :-)].  If we based our declaration on THAT declaration, as opposed to basing it on the U.S. Bill of Rights, it would be less likely to meet objections from people outside of the United States. In any case, among the rights I think that need to be established (and this is by no means a complete list, jsut what I came up with in the last few hours)
Oops, sorry, went a little overboard, but you get the point (actually, I like the 'access' one.  It's actually pretty important.)
In any case, we are on the esge of a new world here, and I fear that reactionary regulation will make it into a dreadful world to live in.  Perhaps something like the above, coupled with a grassroots organizational effort that we have shown to be so successful in cyberspace will perhaps slow the regulational onslaught, or perhaps even turn it to freedoms advantage.
I'd really like to hear your opinions on this.
(BTW:  I did not bring this up in EFF forums because I was concerned with 'Americanizing' this idea too much.  Instead, it is my belief that if this was a more international effort, with US and other civil-liberty groups signing on AFTER, it may be more successful.  Perhaps I'm wrong which case I will repost this into other forums).
I appreciate your time.

@_subject: THOUGHT: International Electronic Declaration of Rights 
Unfortunately, I don't think the anarchy of the net will work for much longer.  Sooner or later, cryptography issues aside, somebody is going to regulate access or content or both.
I'll re-qualify that below.  I didn't fully explain my position.
Ok, I should have qualified this as well.  It also has to do with the proper 'forum' as well (and I didn't want to get into specific examples in my original posting).  The old idea that you can't yell "fire" in a crowded theatre.  Not because 'Fire' is a censored word, or yelling 'fire' is bad in all cases, but because a crowded theatre is an improper forum.
As a list example, if you run a list about the ecology of fishes, and someone comes on and starts talking about women's rights issue (an actual example from LSTOWN-L), that is an improper forum.  You are "retaliating" not because of the speech itself, but because this specific forum does not exist FOR that speech.
I meant, I guess, that I have a right to, for example, criticize my government, religion, boss, etc without being fearful of real-world retaliation.  Why did I say this?  Because I can imagine the U.S. government deciding that electronic forums that aren't email, for example, are not protected speech, and thus if I am on IRC, and I and my buddys criticise Clinton, I am a candidate for arrest for "subversive" activity.
Please see above.
My initial concern, and this stems mostly from where I have encountered the networks, in an educational setting.  It is very common to arbitrarily remove a student from access with neither hearing nor even
informing of the student of why his/her access was cut.  Yes, it may have been justified, but it is still my opinion that a person shoudl be given not only a reason for denial of access, but also a chance to address those reasons.
As for private-oriented networks.  This is a little more sticky.  _IF_ they are common carrier (which is still, as I understand, being decided), then I feel that denying a patron, who is paying his bills, access is a tremendous wrong.  If computer services are NOT common carrier, than that is certainly a different issue, and should be a more internal matter.  As I understand, the telcos have a fairly established procedure of dealing with non-paying customers AND abusive customers.  Of course, they are also protected legally by common-carrier status.
Access shoudl be granted just like with a telephone.  If you can pay for it, you shoudl get it.  If you cannot pay for it, you don't get it.  But, if you can pay for it, you shoud NOT(!!!) be denied access.
See above about 'forums'.  Also, my largest concern above was with access policies (sorry, you are the 4th born child, you cannot use the computer.  Sorry, you are jewish, you are not allowed access).  Remember, there are areas outside the US that will routinely deny rights based on these arbitrary classifications that we in the U.S. don't even think about.  Also, the idea was that you would get access to Cyberspace.  The individual groups and forums exist just as they do in real life.  I find it doubtful that there would be many blacks clamboring to be members of the KKK, and few members of the KKK wanting to belong to the NAACP.  The same applies to cyberspace.
And I fear that, even if one can pay, it will become more and more common to outright deny access to people.  The lifeblood of this world is the passing of information.  The regulations I see on the horizon look to me to be a tourniquet on that information.
But even strong crypto is useless if people cannot access the information I think fundamentally you and I agree much more that it seems, so I hope not to start a flamewar. :-)

Ok, this is a 'what if':
What if:
What if:
If you think about it, the above makes sense.  The government wants to spy on the population, but the population can't know about the spying.  Thus, they propose escrowing keys, which they know will raise public outrage.  They put up a half-hearted fight and then back down, making hte public thinks they've won.
In reality, though, Big Borther has won as they have put an compromised algorithm into general use that will allow them to do what they wanted to all along.
Granted, they couldn't prosecute cases with evidence from taped Skipjack communications, but as we've seen, wiretaps are used so infrequently that it really isn't relevant.  But, as long as they lay low, they can spy on any Skipjacked communications among business and other government agencies.
Is the above feasible?

Trust Congress? Not With This Unbelievable Lair of Slop
PC Computing, April 1994, page 88.
By John C. Dvorak
 When Vice President Gore began talking about the Information Highway,
 we all knew the bureaucrats would get involved more than we might
 like. In fact, it may already be too late to stop a horrible Senate
 bill from becoming law.
 The moniker -- Information Highway -- itself seems to be responsible
 for SB  Introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy, it's designed to
 prohibit anyone from using a public computer network (Information
 Highway) while the computer user is intoxicated. I know how silly this
 sounds, but Congress apparently thinks that being drunk on a highway
 is bad no matter what kind of highway it is. The bill is expected to
 pass this month.
 There already are rampant arguments as to how this proposed law can
 possibly be enforced. The FBI hopes to use it as an excuse to do
 routing wiretaps on any computer if there is any evidence that the
 owner "uses or abuses alcohol and has access to a modem." Note how it
 slips in the word 'uses'. This means if you've been seen drinking one
 lone beer, you can have your line tapped.
 Because this law would be so difficult to enforce, police officials
 are drooling over the prospect of easily obtaining permits to do
 wiretaps. Ask enforcement officials in Washington and they'll tell you
 the proposed law is idiotic, but none will oppose it. Check the
 classified ads in the "Washington Post" and you'll find the FBI,
 National Security Agency, and something called the Online Enforcement
 Agency (when did they set that up?) all soliciting experts in phone
 technology, specifically wiretapping.
 It gets worse. The Congressional Record of February 19, 1994, has a
 report that outlines the use of computerized BBSes, Internet,
 Inter-Relay Chat, and CompuServe CB as "propagating illicit sexual
 encounters and meetings between couples -- any of whom are
 underage...Even people purporting to routinely have sex with animals
 are present on these systems to foster their odd beliefs on the
 public-at-large." A rider on SB  makes it a felony to discuss
 sexual matters on any public-access network, including the Internet,
 America Online, and CompuServe.
 I wondered how private companies such as America Online can be
 considered public-access networks, so I called Senator Barbara
 Boxer's office and talked to an aide, a woman named Felicia. She said
 the use of promotional cards that give away a free hour or two of
 service constitutes public access. You know, like the ones found in the
 back of books or in modem boxes. She also told me most BBS systems
 fall under this proposed statute. When asked how they propose to
 enforce this law, she said it's not Congress's problem.  "Enforcement
 works itself out over time," she said.
 The group fighting this moronic law is led by Jerome Bernstein of the
 Washington law firm of Bernstein, Bernstein and Knowles (the firm that first
 took Ollie North as a client). I couldn't get in touch with any of the
 co-sponsors of the bill (including Senator Ted Kennedy, if you can believe
 it!), but Bernstein was glad to talk. "These people have no clue about the
 Information Highway or what it does. The whole thing got started last
 Christmas during an antidrinking campaign in the Washington D.C., metro
 area," Bernstein said, "I'm convinced someone jokingly told Leahy's office
 about drunk driving on the Information High and the idea snowballed. These
 senators actually think there is a physical highway. Seriously, Senator Pat
 Moynihan asked me if you needed a driving permit to 'drive' a modem on the
 Information Highway! He has no clue what a modem is, and neither does the
 rest of Congress."
 According to Bernstein, the antisexual wording in the bill was
 attributed to Kennedy's office. "Kennedy thought that technology was
 leaving him behind, and he wanted to be perceived as more up-to-date
 technologically. He also though this would make amends for his alleged
 philandering."
 Unfortunately, the public is not much better informed than the
 Senate.  The Gallup Organization, at the behest of Congress, is
 polling the public regarding intoxication while using a computer and
 online "hot chatting." The results are chilling. More than half of the
 public thinks that using a computer while intoxicated should be
 illegal! The results of the sexuality poll are not available. But one
 question, "Should a teenage boy be encouraged to pretend he is a girl
 while chatting with another person online?" has civil rights activists
 alarmed. According to Kevin Avril of the ACLU, "This activity doesn't
 even qualify as virtual cross-dressing. Who cares about this stuff?
 What are we going to do? Legislate an anti-boys-will-be-boys law? It
 sets a bad precedent."
 I could go on and on with quotes and complaints from people regarding
 this bill. But most of the complaints are getting nowhere. Pressure
 groups, such as one led by Baptist ministers from De Kalb County,
 Georgia, are supporting the law with such vehemence that they've
 managed to derail an effort by modem manufacturers (the biggest being
 Georgia-based Hayes) to lobby against the law. "Who wants to come out
 and support drunkenness and computer sex?" asked a congressman who
 requested anonymity.
 So, except for Bernstein, Bernstein, and Knowles, and a few members of
 the ACLU, there is nothing to stop this bill from becoming law. You
 can register your protests with your congressperson or Ms. Lirpa Sloof
 in the Senate Legislative Analysts Office.  Her name spelled backward
 says it all.

@_subject: Meeting Ramblings 
Just thought I'd take a few minutes to off some comments on the virtual
meeting on 2/9.
1)  Agenda
        There was a problem in that, while the topic of the hall was set,
        imeediately everyone launched into every other concern they had as
        well.  This led to a total confusion that eventually splintered
        the participants.
        I think that next time, there should be a set agenda, with a time
        limit for each subject.  For example
        10:00 - 10:25   Issues of Copyright on Usenet
        10:30 - 10:55   Remailers
        11:00 - 11:25   Anonimity on the Net
        11:30 - 11:55   DigiCash
        Thus, at 10:00, there would be a topic, at 10:25, the topic is
        wound down (either moving to another location or finishing) and
        people gear up for a topic change.  That way, if I had no
        interest in copyright, I could wait until 10:30 to sign on.
        In the meantime, if people want to talk about something other
        than the main topic, they can amble off to their own room.
        (perhaps build some 'meeting rooms' off of the main hall, and
        people can go in there, set the topic of the room and talk about
        that, while the main hall has the main topic)
2)  Speaking
        The idea of there being four people speaking at one time is good,
        but there was a problem of people getting a speaker position and
        refusing to yield, thus people never moved up the queue.  This is
        bad.  Perhaps auto-yields after 2 'says' (in case you munged the
        first) would help.
Hmm, now that I think about it, I guess that's about all.  I really think the meeting was a good idea, and I hope it happens again real soon.  Just a little more organizing would have been more helpful.
Thanks to all who did this :-)

I also recommend, if you don't want to use emacs, that you look for the client called 'tiny fugue'.  That's what I connected with and it did a very good job do keeping things sane.
There are, of course, several other clients out there as well.  Check the rec.games.mud* FAQs for a list.

@_subject: Pornography Server 
In response to the posting about setting up a pornography server (Sorry, I'm afraid I deleted the specific message so I cannot remember who you was :-).
That is certainly a way for people to get and use PGP and to get used the remailers.  It would get a lot of heavy use as well.  Now, if there was a way to batch mailings (so that if, say, six people ordered one item, it would be sent as one letter to all six instead of six different letters, with precedence set to bulk), that would help even more.
Now, there are also some practical considerations as well.  What materials do you archive?  If you put up pictures (gif or jpeg), you will be talking about tremendous amounts of traffic.  Once they are uuencoded, even with compression, they can be huge.  If you limit yourself to things such as stories and the like, you will have less traffic, but also less There is also the legal side of distributing pornography.   Interstate transfer is naughty and with Al Gore's Information-Superhighway Patrol, it will raise some very political issues (but, by using a decent blind system, for all the patrol knows, the distributor might be in the recipient's state).
Also, and this is really just an interface issue, scripts should be developed that will automate the retrieval process (ie, build and submit the mail message).  These would be similiar to the hop.mail or anon.mail scripts, but would be custom to the pornography server.
For example:
  		This is to cut down mail-spoofing to mail-bomb an enemy The server can either reply immediately with the appropriate files, or it can batch everything up for processing during low-traffic times (I personally like the first, but dont' really care that much).  The mail is then PGP encrypted back to the recipient (by getting the key from a key server, or by having the orderee register their key before hand, with the latter probably being easier, although it does leave a paper trail that can be examined) and sent out with precedence set to 'bulk' so that other stuff is more important on the mail links.
It should all be fairly accomplishable with a series of perl and sh scripts on either end.  The real question is what to offer.
I'll talk more about this from an organizational stand-point if anyone is interested.  I'm afriad that I'm really not that good a programmer (even of simple shells) as my field of expertise is in management and other administrative stuff (but obviously not spelling :-)

@_subject: PGP posting validation 
Just to verify, I followed up to a previous posting, it wasn't mine originally :-)
Please don't take this as confrontational (ie, this is not a flame :-)
How would requiring that postings made to a list be verifyable be censorship?  What it does is verify that REAL people posted the message and that the person who's address is on the message is actually the person that posted it.
Now, granted, I suppose it could end up dumping some postings because they were forged, and that is sort of censoring.  But it isn't censoring based on content, but based on the fact that it appears to be a forgery.  And by bouncing a message back to the person that posted it, you give them an opportunity to repost (this time signed) in case they forgot.
Also, as for the filter idea.  If some jerk is posting a message as appearing to come from schmuck at foo.bar.com, yes, I could add that address to my filter and delete it before i see it, but if the jerk starts posting as coming from idjit at bar.foo.com, I'd have to add another filter By doing a check of the digital signature against the posters public key, you eliminate most instances of forgery.  Of course, if the poster's key is compromised, that's a different story.

I know that Majordom will allow you to create a private list.  The list admin must add new subscriptions, but users are able to remove themselves without admin intervention.  Of course, MD has the problem in that if the person requests unsubscription from a different address than they are at, it will choke with a 'Subscription not found'.
Also, you can set the list to be completely closed so that persons who aren't subscribed cannot post, but that does eliminate remailers from I don't know off-hand what type of software this list is based on, so this is probably all irrelevant.

But one of the important things is that action is not JUST writing code.  There are those of use who are unable to write good code (or, I suppose, any code at all) or do not comprehend the math of cryptography.  They are just as needed in the battle as those who compile.
Cypherpunks (the list) I believe has sorta become a combination of talk.politics.crypto and sci.crypt, and provides a uniqie opportunity to integrate both the coding adn the political sides into one cohesive fighting force.  The small number of (active) participants allows this to be done in a very intimate and (relatively) fast fashion.
This is a GOOD thing.

@_subject: Is the list down? 
Or you could remove the ability to whois the subscribers of the list.  I know it can be done as queernet has done that for its majordomo lists.  At the very least, that will remove the ability to get a listing of who is subscribed, although I kind think it's nice to be able to see who is on the list.
I worry that requiring PGP or some other signature could pose problems for those outside the U.S., especially if MIT-PGP is apparently not Another choice is to require a confirmation from the subscriber.  I run several LISTSERV mailing lists, and while it doesn't require confirmation for unsibscription (just signing up), it does keep down on the number of "accidental" activities.  It'd be pretty trivial to hack majordomo to reply to the address in the whois list (instead of the Reply-To:) and maintain a small database of 'pending' people.  By requiring a, say, six-digit code in the subject line of the confirmation, the software can verify that it is genuine.
As I said, LISTSERV implements something similiar as an option for subscribing.  Maybe even for unsubscribing (I've never checked).

When 2.5 was first announced a few weeks ago (with the non infamous keyserver announcement), there was some concerns expressed over the political manipulations of the new program and thus, the overall security of the code.  To this date I haven't seen any additional commentary on that subject, and I figure that before I recommend locally changing to 2.5, I'd like to find out what exactly was changed from the standpoint of the algoritms and the overall safety of them.

Seems to me, perhaps, that the introduction of 2.6 might be a precursor to RSA legally cracking down on anyone running pre-2.6 versions (accepting that 2.4, viacrypt, is ok).  Scarey if you think about it, especially if the RSA folx are in bed with the fed, which doesn't seem that unrealistic considering the political climate.  That, coupled witht he fact that no one has yet verified the seciurity of 2.5/2.6 lead me to seriously question the security of this new version, since we are essentially being forced to use it if RSA starts suing everyone, or gets the fed to crack down because of patent Sorry, just a rambling...

Oh, i agree.  Security of 2.6 and the agenda are probably just fine, but we've had no independent verification of that security, and revelations of the agenda, and being a paranoid cypherpunk who missed woodstock (sorry couldn't resist), that is an issure that very much concerns me.  To push an UNTESTED product with an unknown background forceably to replace something we can trust is something I consider to be sinister.
The whole fiasco, from the day the new keyserver restrictions were announced, to the half-hearted neta announcement, to this new one, no not show a program that has been fully tests.  As if we are supposed to accept it just because it has the name PGP on it.  Homey don't play that.

I guess I'm sorta confused.  2.3x cannot 'legally' be used in the U.S., and it seems that the release of 2.6 is motivated in part so that U.S. users of 2.3 can become "special friends" of the RSA goonsquad.  Yet, 2.6 cannot be used by anyone outside of the U.S./Canada.  So what is the solution that will be legal, secure, and useful for the whole world?
Do we (the cypherpunk community) perhaps need to come up with EBP 1.0 (Even Better Privacy) that abandons the RSAREF patent problem with some other public-key system that is functionally equial and just as safe?
Sorry, I'm babbling, but as I said, I do not relish the thought of becoming a special friend of RSA's lawyers.  (Or worse, what if 'exporting' a digital signature violates ITAR and makes you a very special friend of an over-ambitious federal district attorney?)

   Do we (the cypherpunk community) perhaps need to come up with EBP 1.0    (Even Better Privacy) that abandons the RSAREF patent problem with some    other public-key system that is functionally equial and just as safe?
  EBP would have to provide the two critical functions of PGP --
digital signatures, and key distribution.
  There exist signature standards other than RSA.  Perhaps the USA's
DSS can be exported.  If not, there may well be other systems out
there.  Feel free to implement DSS, or others.
  But the critical problem seems to be encryption.  Or more exactly the
key distribution problem.  How do I and my secret corespondant share a
secret key?  I only know of four kinds of solutions.
  Send the key via a secure channel.  Secure chanels are hard to find,
and as history teaches us, not fully secure.  (Read Kahn for
  Use a trusted key distributer.  Trusted.  Ha.  This is cypherpunks
  Public key cryptography.  The problem is that PKP (or is it RSADSI?)
claims pattent rights to the whole PK ball of wax.  The Diffe Helman
key exchange (oblivious transfer?) pattent will expire the soonest,
and it can be used in the future.
  The really exciting result, IMHO, is from crypto 92 that I mentioned
a while back.  If A and B can hear a source of bits S with some
errors, then they can generate a shared secret which even an eves
dropper with much greater (listening) resources can't discover.  This
is exciting.  Is it pattented?  Does it work on the internet?  I don't
  Unfortunately all of these suffer from various active tapper
attacks.  More unfortuneately, on the internet active tapping isn't
very hard to arrange.  If you can come up with aditional solutions, or
ones more resistant to active tappers, please publish.

@_subject: Cypherpunks' Electronic Book2 
Let me just make a couple of comments here, and you can decide if what I can offer is what you need.
I will be putting a low-end workstation online in a couple of weeks (mid-june).  By the end of june, I should have any bugs in the OS worked out, a good backup made, and the machine should be ready to do stuff with (I'm being overly generous on the time, just in case).  This will be an ethernetted workstation, not SLIPed, so connectivity is no problem.
Now, what I can do is install Majordomo and set up any mailing lists that are needed.  Eric suggested in private mail that perhaps a series of regional cypherpunks lists would be helpful for planning of physical meetings and the like.  I can, of course, also set up lists for the CEB project.  Each list will have its own administrator that IS NOT me :-)
Majordomo also appears (I havn't fully groked it yet) to support file archives using a 'get' parameter, so any files that are produced can be made available via the same software, or some other software if it becomes available.  I can help with the setup of the software as well. I _am not_ willing to administrate the CEB, though.  I know that in the near future I just wouldn't have time.  Besides, I've got a book that was due last week (got a month reprieve :-) and two more that I am working on, and that is enough playing editor for any man's sanity.  This, coupled with my new admin job working for the city, just kills my free time.
I may (maybe) be able to make an account available to the editor, but the machine itself is not very capable beyond the above, so you wouldn't be getting much out of it except a platform to hack from :-)
Assuming no problems, I shoudl have everything ready to go with the above in about a month, perhaps a little less.
Let me know if that would work.

I don't have an answer to your question, but you did bring up something I've been meaning to ask about for some time and I never really got around to it; Are there any short-term plans to press for an RFC utilizing digital signatures?  With the exponential increase of mail users, as well and the influx of Compu$erv, AOL, Prodigy and other users, some methods for the transparent use of digital signatures needs to be worked out before it becomes too difficult to implement change because the commercial services have all the power.  (or worse, before the government decides for us.)
Of course the question then become one of which standard to use.  PGP may seem great, but if there are nothing buy licencing problems and political backlash, maybe something else needs to be looked at.
Sorry, just a-babblin'.

@_subject: "Packet Sniffers" 
I know this is probably the wrong forum, but I also know that the quality of hte people here is ample to get my question answered.
I am an undergraduate student at a state university in Minnesota.  This
summer as part of a long-term independent study I set up a Linux machine on the campus ethernet, get it assigned an IP, and then proceeded to do a practicum on system administration and information management.  (This is also the same machine that briefly rand the digested version of the Cypherpunks mailing list).
Following some departmental conflicts and (IMHO) illegal sanctions, the
machine was shut down for some unspecified "security concerns". Essentially, it turns out, the computer science department didn't was this
kind of independent project around.  So I trundled across campus to
another college, got the proper faculty behind me and submitted for the
continuance of the project. After three weeks of jumping through the correct hoops and over the correct hurdles, there appears to be only one "concern" remaining.  Some junior computer administrator has raised the concept of "packet sniffers" as being a suitable bar for my project (the machine is a 486/66 Linux machine).  Unfortunately, I haven't a clue what exactly  a "packet sniffer" is and am really not in a position to answer the arguments in even a semi-informed manner.
Thus, I am posting here in the hope that one or more of you can take a moment to give me the lowdown on what these things are.  Common sense seems to indicate that it is a piece of software or firmware that will display the contents of any packets that pass through the machine on its way to the correct destination.
The specific setup would have the machine on a thinnet link in a lab with about 20 other PCs which are used primarily as word processors and terminals to the campus VAX or UNIX machines.  The specific upstream setup is unknown, but I assume there is some kind of a line to a router upstream, eventually winding its way into the real world.
It seems to me that a packet sniffer on the lowest link of the network wouldn't be able to look at those packets passing upstream because the router would never pass them down, but I could be just plain wrong and thats why I'm asking for some clarification.
Thanks for your help.  Sorry if this seems confusing.

@_subject: Is cypherpunks archived somewhere? 
It is my belief that I will be able to get my machine up and running within the next few working days.  At that time I will re-coordinate with Eric and start keeping digests of the cypherpunks lists and those archives will be available to the public via mail-server.

@_subject: The Importance of Filtering 
One of the things that might be helpful with regards to filtering would be
some kind of a user-friendly interface that will allow easy editing and
manipulation of the elm filter or procmail rules.  (For example, the Tin
newsreader has a good entry screen for killfiles based on subject or
author.) In addition, I remember way back when when I was using NN as a
newsreader, there was a way to set up killfiles with a certain number of
days before they would timeout and be removed from the killfile. If a program existed that would allow similiar manipulation of mail
killfiles, that would be great.  (regretably, I am a dreadful programmer
and really am not sure how to design or write the program). As for the digested version of this list, I have received good word and hopefully my machine will be back online in the next couple days.

@_subject: US vs Overseas Banks 
It's interesting to note that where I am (Mankato, Minnesota) I was able to open a checking account with NO ID what so ever.  I just wrote down a name and address (which is a P.O. box, BTW) and the next wee I had a box of checks (free) and a ATM card (also free).
Of course, this bank has been criticized for being somewhat lax on who they give accounts to, but the point still stands.  I could have been anybody, and give any false address.  *shrug*

Normally, I don't like reposting things to this list.  However, I am going to report this from the most recent version of CuD, because I think it hits a very important nail right on the head.  Not just that PGP is going, but it puts all of the terms we on this list have been bantering around for the last couple of years into ones that laymen can understand.
I sincerely thing that this is the kind of push we need to make as a whole to bring about social change on the net (and social change is what is needed).  Ie, PGP is good because 1) it keeps people from reading your email (like an envelope) and 2) it makes sure nobody forges your messages by allowing you to digitally sign them.
Anyways, sorry for the report, please flame lightly :-)

@_subject: My pseudo-anonymous dream list 
There was some talk on Friday about "nym" servers similar in operation to anon.penet.fi.  I was meaning to provide some commentary on Friday, but it kinda got pushed back by a lazy weekend.
Anyways, I wanted to toss some non-technical things into the fray about what I'd like to see in a good "nym" server.  If you grow weary from my wish-rants, press 'd' now :-)
Anon.penet.fi is arguably one of the most used anonymous servers on the Internet.  One of the chief reasons it is used so much by so many so often is because it is also the easiest to use.  Posting to a newsgroup or mailing to another person is handled without having to think about anything.  This is quite unlike most anonymous remailers which require quite a bit more work (for the lay person) for only one-way mailing.
Any future remailers (and for the purpose of this message, assume
"remailer" means a pseudo-anonymous remailing mechanism like penet.fi)
will need to maintain the ease of use that penet.fi has.  No messy headers
of embedded command lines.  Just send the message to an address and it's
taken care of. There are, however, a great number of internal improvements that could be made that would both improve user-end usefulness AND improve overall 1)  Multiple Remailers:
I'd like to see multiple (maybe >12) remailers that utilize the same
database, upgraded by batched processes once or twice a day or "broadcast"
realtime to all the reamilers in the web (probably the latter is better). In this way, a person with a pseudo-ID of FOO, could be addressed as FOO
at ANY of the remailers.  The primary purpose of this is to allow easy
chaining (see below), but it might also serve to distribute much of the
load around the net.  Penet.fi is grossly overloaded, so a solution to
that needs to be found. 2)  Encrypted Databases:
One of the failings of anon.penet.fi that has been exploited by by various LEAs is the fact that the database of users is accessible by the operator.  Any properly designed 'nym' server should have a totally encrypted database.  Thus if your local LEA roams by demanding to know the name of the person associated with an ID, the best the operator can do is to give them a copy of the encrypted entry from the database (or, I suppose, the entire database :-)
3)  Limited ID lifetime
Another failing, IMHO, with penet.fi is that ID have an unlimited lifetime.  I think any remailer should limit the lifetime of any ID to no longer than 12 months, with six months being the default, and 3 months being an option (plus, of course, a manual cancelation on the part of the user).  When an ID is expired, it is removed entirely from the database and NOT reissued again.
4)  Chained Mailings
Because you have many remailers operating, all messages should be randomly
chained through them.  Perhaps the default number of hops is three, with
the user-definable of 1 to 20.  This means that while I might send a
message to alt.sex.abuse.recovery at anon.mit.edu, it might end up being
posted from anon.berkeley.edu after passing through anon.umn.edu and
anon.toad.com.  It makes traffic analysis that much more difficult. Before a chaining is done, the remailer should ping the target remailer to
make sure it is up, so that mail isn't sitting in the queue.  All chained
mail should also be encrypted. 5)  Encryption/Signature Validation
Any message that is emailed PGP signed should be validated by the remailer
(with the User having to email in their public key as part of the
registration process, if they so choose, or remailers can use the
keyserver).  If the signature is valid, a line is added in remailer
information section to the effect of "Message PGP Validated" and then sent
PGP signed by the remailer. (the original sender's PGP signature is
removed). An encrypted message should simply be PGP Signed by the final remailer posted/emailed to the destination
Because there are multiple remailers (chained), only the final remailer should sign the message.
6)  Two-way
This goes pretty much without saying.  If I send mail to somebody or post to news through a remailer, the person who received the message should be able to reply to my anonymous mailbox and I get the message (signed, of course, by the remailer).
7)  Option Validation
In order to change any of the options on your ID (ie, the expiration date
of your ID, or to expire it immediately, or to set the number of "hops" you want to chain through), you should have to submit a PGP Signed command
message.  Then, similar to a LISTSERV that confirms subscriptions and
unsubscriptions, a message is sent back asking you to "ok" these changes. This return message is sent as PGP encrypted email to your public key. When you decode it, you are given a, say, 10digit code string that you need
to mail back to confirm the changes. If you don't, it doesn't.  This helps keep down spoofing of messages changing your options without
your ok.  It's not perfect, and isn't totally secure, but it will catch
many.  In addition, you encourage the use of PGP by requiring it for
changing any options.  You can still use the remailer without PGP, but you
can't access the options and are stuck with the defaults. However, one item that should not be allowed to be changed is your email address.  If you move from foo at blah.com to blah at foo.com, you need to get a new ID, and expire the old one (or it will die by itself within a year). 8)  Robust Web of Remailers
Remailers come and go daily.  Any pseudo-anonymous remailer web needs to
be able to handle that fact.  Thus, a mechanism needs to be put into place
to allow for easy adding of a new machine (if it's easy, more people will
do it) with minimal maintanence.  In addition, if a remailer disappears
(say, because somebody caught wind of it and ordered the student to turn
it off :-), the rest of the remailer web needs to be able to survive.  Of
course, that particular address will be dead, but with apprpriate FAQs
posted around, people should be able to quickly find another address that
uses the same database. 9)  Proper PR
This beeds to be properly advertised as well.  Penet.fi, whether good or bad, has a reputation of being a breeding ground for law-breakers.  Any web set up needs to be pushed as nothing more than a "P.O. Box" on the Internet or some such.  In reality, nothing is different, but in the public light, it would work better.
10)  There is no number 10
Hmm, guess that's about it.  Comments are appreciated (really they are :-)

@_subject: RC40 and what we still need to do 
I have been watching the backlash of the cracking of RC40 and am quite impressed with the fact that it is being used as a positive reason for repealing ITAR.  I expected the media to jump on the "hacker" bandwagon and denounce the efforts.
However, I think there is still value in writing the software that will allow cooperation amoung hundreds or thousands of people.  That way, we could harness the space CPU of machines all over the globe and make the cracking of this kind of stuff routine.  So instead of taking 8 days, it takes only a day or so, further eliminating the idea that it "takes too long to be worthwhile".  Maybe there would even be value in going at a 128-bit key (granted, it would take a year).
I'd anticipate with proper advertising, easy-to-use software, and little programming knowledge require, we could easily harness 10,000+ machines and a few dozen parallel machines.
I know we have a 99.9% idle MasPAR I can contribute to the effort, which should be able to do 1million+ keys/sec.  It's just dying to have a ____           Robert A. Hayden      <=> hayden at krypton.mankato.msus.edu

@_subject: Silly technical question from a non-technical person 
I'm be piceing together things on this list that I have only a passing understanding of (at a code level).
If it costs $10,000 to crack one 40-bit key (putting aside whether we agree on that price or not), could not the software be designed in such a manner that it is able to check, say, 10,000 keys at the same time?  Ie, it computes a key, and then checks it against the array of data to see if it fits any of them, and then goes on to the next one.
Maybe that would be an interesting test.  Randomly compute say 10,000 sessions and they try to crack them all at the same time.  Theoretically, it would reduce that $10,000/crack cost dramatically.
Of course, I could very well be wrong....

As far as I understand, no.  1)  you can't export PGP.
2)  even though it's out there, making software with hooks for PGP is     equally bad in the eyes of the NSA.  There wa some talk on     alt.internet.media-coverage (and the thread is being crossposted all     over the place) about mosaic having to remove PGP hooks before the     NSA would let them export.
3)  Frankly, I don't necessarily trust something that plays with my     personal stuff if I can't access the source code to make sure it's not     messin' with it :-)

@_subject: PINESIGN 2.2 (re: PGP for Pine) 
I've been out of town this week, so I coulsn't respond in a timely manner (and I returned to 500+ pieces of cypherpunks email :-)
I'm appending a copy of PineSign 2.2, ehich is the most recent version of the PineSign program.  It doesn't do any encryption, it simple allows for easy signing of messages composed with pine (and maybe other mailers as well).  If you want to encrypt and such, I'd recommend mkpgp if you can find it or perhaps autopgp does it (not sure).
I also have a version of a similiar program for Tin available on my home page, or I can post it if there is interest.
# PINESIGN v2.2
# Written by:  Robert A. Hayden # PINESIGN is a simple program that will allow you to automatically sign # your email and news messages composed with the Pine 3.91 mail reader.  It # may also work with other mail and news programs, but it has not been # tested.
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONFIGURING PINE
# # You need to define the following options in Pine.  This can be done # either via the SETUP options in the main menu of Pine, or via editing # the .pinerc. # 	A)	signature-file=" "  (an empty space)
#	B)	enable-alternate-editor-cmd
#	C)	enable-alternate-editor-implicitly (optional but recommended)
#	D) 	signature-at-bottom
#	E)	editor=
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONFIGURING PINESIGN
# The PGP program must be in your path, and the PGPPATH environment # variable must be defined.  See the PGP documentation for details.
# Double check that the first line of this program points to sh. # In addition to PGP and the editor you define, PineSign also will use the
# following programs:
#       cat
#	clear
#       echo
#	mv
# Execute the command "chmod 700 "
# Edit the SIGPATH and PINEEDITOR variables to point at your signature # (if any) and the editor you wish to use for your Pine mail.  Default # signature will be the file .signature-pine in your $HOME directory.  # Default editor is pico -z -t.
# Define SIGPATH=/dev/null if you do not have an ASCII signature to
# append.
PINEEDITOR='pico -z -t'
# Next, define the ECHOTYPE variable.  Some systems do not allow the use # of the echo -n command.  If your system doesn't like echo -n, uncomment # the plain echo variable and comment out (put a " in front of it) the # echo -n commant.
ECHOTYPE='echo -n'
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING PINESIGN
# When you compose a message, you will compose your message as normal.  # When you exit your editor (control-X in Pico), you will receive a prompt # asking if you wish to add your signature file to the message.  If you # respond with y, Y or just press return, your text signature file will # be appended to your message.  If you type anything else, your message # will not have your signature added.
# Next, you will be prompted as to whether you wish to PGP sign your
# message.  If you answer with y, Y or return, you will be prompted for your
# PGP passphrase and then dumped back to the address/subject section of
# Pine.  If you type anything else, your message will not be signed.  # If you selected it to be added, your signature file will be appended # AFTER your digital signature. # If you have not defined your alternate editor to be run implicitly, you # will need to start it manually.  If you do not run the alternate editor,
# your signature file will not be appended and you will also have to do
# that manually.  It is highly recommended that your define your alternate
# editor to run implicitly.  DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING $PINEEDITOR $1
$ECHOTYPE "Would you like to add your ASCII signature to this message? [y] " read SIG
echo " "
$ECHOTYPE "Would you like to sign this message with your PGP signature? [y] "
read PGP
if [ "$PGP" = "y" ]
if [ "$PGP" = "Y" ]
if [ "$PGP" = "" ]
if [ "$SIG" = "y" ]
if [ "$SIG" = "Y" ]
if [ "$SIG" = "" ]
# REVISION HISTORY
# 1.0 -	Original Release
# 2.0 - Added the ability to select whether or not to add the ASCII signature
# 2.1 - Forgot to add the +clearsig=on parameter to the PGP statements.  #	OOPS!
# 2.2 - CURRENT RELEASE
#	After receiving complaints about some systems not being able to #	handle the -n parameter for echo, added in the ECHOTYPE variable.

For those that dont' need quite this much or don't have access to pine at the install level (often for university systems with a central software depository), I have a script called PineSign available on my home page (or email me) that will allow simple PGP singing of your pine mailings and postings.  I doesn't do encryption, but works great for signatures.
For encryption, I usually do that withing filespace anyways where I have a little more control over things.
Of course, as with all things UNIX, you use what you find most useful.  That's why there are 101 ways to do anything. :-)

I am appending the file from the EFF that talks about the privledge/right distinction.  There is a URL as part of the file.
=============== ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/CAF/faq/just-a-privilege ===============
q: If a state university calls computer or network access a
"privilege", can they remove an individual's access arbitrarily?
a: In most cases no. U.S. courts no longer recognize the wooden
distinction between privileges and rights [Board of Regents v.  Roth,
408 U.S. 564 (1972)].
One need only look at the Constitution to see that "privilege" is
often used to mean something different than its informal use. The 14th
Amendment says "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall
abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United
States;". The Constitution also refers to the "privilege of the writ
of habeas corpus", "privileges and immunities of citizens in the
several States", and "privileged from arrest during their attendance
at the session of their respective houses".
In _Goss v. Lopez_, the Supreme Court said a "student's legitimate
entitlement to a public education is a property interest which is
protected by the Due Process Clause and .. may not be taken away for
misconduct without adherence to the minimum procedures required by
that Clause." The Court went on to say that "the Due Process Clause
also forbids arbitrary deprivations of liberty. 'Where a person's good
name, reputation, honor or integrity is at stake because of what the
government is doing to him,' the minimal requirements of the Clause
must be satisfied."
So what are a university student's property rights?  "The Fourteenth
Amendment requires due process before a governmental entity, such as a
public institution, may deprive one of life, liberty, or property. In
a college setting, a student's good name and reputation are considered
a 'liberty' right, and a student's right to attend college is
considered a 'property' right. Due process would be required before a
student is deprived of either at a public institution." [_A Practical
Guide to Legal Issues Affecting College Teachers_ by Partrica A.
Hollander, D. Parker Young, and Donald D. Gehring.  (College
Administration Publication, 1985).]
So is a student's computer access a property right? I'd say it
depends. On one extreme, I'm confident a student has a property right
in account financed via the student computer or engineering fee. On
the other extreme, if a professor informally gave a student an account
on that professor's personal workstation, the professor could probably
remove that access without due process.
So what about department accounts? In the departments I know of,
accounts are given to any students who meet some set of requirements.
I think this makes them an entitlement for the students who qualify
and hence some modicum of due process is necessary.

I read with interest about the (about time) reorganization of the EFF.  While it is certainly a little early to make any kind of final decisions about the EFF, I do wonder a few things:
What will the EFF now be doing now that isn't already done by other
organizations? It sure seems to me that this CDT is awfully similiar to the CPSR, except
it's headed by former EFF people who have been puckering up to the
Washington politicos, the Telcos and other entities for the past few years.  Is there really a purpose?
Any thoughts on how the EFF will change it's approach?  I'm due for
renewal in March and I want to make sure I'm not flushing my money away. ____        Robert A. Hayden       <=> hayden at krypton.mankato.msus.edu

joined Adam Curry's "CyberSleaze" mailing list.  About a month later I
unsubscribed.  The messages continued to come and I tried unsubscribing several more times.
Finally I set up a filter rule to flush the message and sent some grumpy email to the postmaster of the site telling them to fix their software (this was about mid-June of 1994).
This morning, I got the following message.  Note the dates on it.

Sorry, I need to disagree here.   The first time I tried to configure X for my Linux system, it barfed.  It also spewed on several subsequent attempts, and this is with pretty standard hardware.  I finally found an X guru locally and he fixed it for me.  At the very least, Windoze and OS/2 and NeXT give you graphics out of the box, with no need to spend several hours configuring it just to get basics up, and no need to try to find some kind of user-oriented documentation to guide you through these hassles. Now, I like Linux/Unix a lot.  It is really one of the better OSes out there, but it isn't very friendly for the person that doesn't know what they are doing, especially to configure basic apps.
I agree.  If I could get a WYSIWYG word processor for X that was as robuse as MS Word or Wordperfect, I'd be a very camper.

@_subject: Crisis Overload (re Electronic Racketeering) 
Unfortunately, a system of social engineering needs to be adopted to get massive use of cryptography started.  This means, and I advocated this from the day I entered this forum, that programs such as PGP need to be redesigned so that the a user friendly . . . so user friendly that any Joe Moron can figure out not only how to use them, but also how it helps them and how it is "good" for them.  This means that we need simplified key management easy enough for the point-and-click masses to utilize.  This means that common mailing programs, From Elm and Pine to AOLs and Computer$erve's mailers need to have TRANSPARENT signing of mail messages and near-transparent encryption of messages.  This means that we need to stop lobbying the governemtn (they dont' listen) and start lobbying Big Business, like IBM, MicroSoft, Apple, etc, to start including encryption hooks in their software.  And if PGP is a problem, International PGP might be an option.  And if there are problems with patent infringements and that kind of crap, then we (the concerned people of the global network) need to develop a free encrytion scheme that can do everything PGP can do and still be legal.
Unfortuately, all I can do is stand on the sidelines and cheer, because I am not a programmer; I'm a user and a teacher.
We've seen the enemy, that the are the 535 senators and representatives in D.C., and the staff in the White House.  It's time to shore up our allies and enter the battle witht he best weapons we have; information and popular use.
Yup.  We all saw it with clipper.  We were all called paranoid.

Hi all, me again.
I've received about a dozen requests to clarify my rant earlier about what I think needs to be done about the future of the CPs and the net, now that the official declaration of war has been made by the government. So, I'm going to do that.  As a quick warning, however, I need to remind everyone that I am not a programmer.  My knowledge of Internet protocols is passable, but actual implementation issues are beyond me.  Basically, I'm a well-informed user with dreams.  Professionally, I'm a teacher and a graduate student in the area of Education Technology (use of modern technologies as applied to education) at Mankato State University in Minnesota.  I also write geek codes and am active politically serving on the college senate and being outspoken in other areas. :-)
Anyways . . .

Nobody's saying it's impossible, what we're saying is that we don't have the resources to DO that on the scale that is needed.  Maybe Microsoft does, but we don't.  What we can do, however, is to shape the culture of the net.  That culture will have to eventually be listened to by DC.

@_subject: PINESIGN:  Simple Script for Signing Pine Email 
I liked using the mkpgp program for signing email, but found that, quite frankly, it had too many features for me to use, when really all I wanted was a program that would sign my messages easily.  This accomplishes just that.  If you want to encrypt messages, either use mkpgp or encrypt your messages outside of pine.
Instructions are provided as comments within the script.
Let me know if you have any problem.

@_subject: RC4 crack 
I remember when RSA129 was being done, the program you have you manually get a start location, and then email transparent any results that it got.  The program that doled out areas to search would base those on what had already been mailed in.  I don't know the details of how exactly that worked, however.
But, if the program could be written in such a way that it was all automatic, mailing in results and automatically (maybe via a telnet port?) getting the information about what to search, that would be most nice. I'd basicly like to be able to start the program, nice it, slam it in the background, and forget about it.

Thanks, I stand corrected.  As I said, I really don't understand at a basic level how it works.  These factoring projects are, to me, an interesting sociological experiment.  Of course, to do this correctly, you need software that is easy to use. :-)
So, the ability to run a program in such a fashion that as much is automated as possible is a "Good Thing{tm}".

@_subject: PINESIGN 2.0: A simple script for PGP signing Pine mail 
After a couple of comments, I've updated Pinesign to a new version.  This new version adds the ability to choose whether your ascii signature (ie $HOME/.signature) is added.  Some mail servers get confused by extra text, so the ability to make sure nothing extra is added was requested.
Basically, if you want to sign the message both digitally and asciilly (is that a word :-), just press return twice after you exit your composing editor.  Otherwise, make the selections you want specific to the type of message you are sending.

Howdy, me again.  In keeping with my wish to make PGP signing of transmissions simple and commonplace, I've got another script for y'all.  This is for the Tin Newsreader.
I hope you find it useful.
Comments appreciated.
# TinSign v1.0
# Written by Robert A. Hayden # Based in part on the PGP editor wrapper, Version 1.0 (editpgp)
# Copyright (c) 1994, Mark Lewis .
# TINSIGN is a simple program that will allow you to automatically sign
# your news messages composed with the TIN 1.2pl2 news reader.  It
# may also work with other news programs, but it has not been tested.
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONFIGURING TIN
# You need to define the following options in Tin.  This is done via # editing the $HOME/.tin/tinrc file.
#	A)	start_editor_offset=ON
#	B)	default_editor_format= +%N %F
#		Example:  /users/foo/bar/tinsign +%N %F
#	C)	default_sigfile=/dev/null
#		NOTE:  	I have been unable to get my copy of tin to read #			any file other than $HOME/.signature, no matter
#			what this parameter is set to.  The solution I #			found was to remove $HOME/.signature and create
#			another file that is read in by defining the
#			variable below.  You may want to experiment with
#			this to find out what works best for you as this #			might be a bug specific to our local compilation.
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONFIGURING TINSIGN
# The PGP program must be in your path, and the PGPPATH environment
# variable must be defined.  See the PGP documentation for details.
# In addition to PGP and the editor you define, TinSign also will use the # following programs:
#	awk
#	cat
#	echo
#	egrep
#	mv
#	rm
#	sleep
# Double check that the first line of this program points to sh.
# Execute the command "chmod 700 ".
# Edit the SIGPATH and TINEDITOR variables to point at your signature
# (if any) and the editor you wish to use for your Tin messages.  Default
# signature will be the file .signature-tin in your $HOME directory.
# Default editor is pico -z -t.
# Define SIGPATH=/dev/null if you do not have an ASCII signature to # append.
TINEDITOR='pico -z -t'
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING TINSIGN
# When you compose a message, you will compose your message as normal.
# When you exit your editor (control-X in Pico), you will receive a # prompt asking for your PGP passphrase.  Type this in.  # At this point, if you have defined one, your ASCII signature will be # appended to the message AFTER the digital signature.
# You will then be put into the Tin menu asking if you wish to edit your # posting some more, quit the post (ie, abort it), or post it.
 DO NOT TAMPER BELOW THIS LINE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING # Define internal variables
 editor
# Split the headers from the body of the article
        awk '{ print }; /^$/ { exit }' $filename > ${tmpdir}/tmp$$.hdr
        awk 'body == 1 { print }; /^$/ { body=1 }' $filename > ${tmpdir}/tmp$$
# Remove "--"
# Sign the message
# clean up any files in temp space
        rm -f ${tmpdir}/tmp$$.hdr ${tmpdir}/tmp$$.asc ${tmpdir}/tmp$$
# append your ASCII signature to the message

@_subject: "Hey Phil! Stop telling people *not* to use PGP!" (plus: "help me with my PGP problems!") (fwd) 
[lots of really really good stuff deleted, because I really don't have anything good to add to it]
I said it last week, and I'll say it again.  From a sociological
standpoint, it's those 10,000,000 computer-illiterate e-mail users that we
need to focus all of our efforts towards.  Those 5,000 literate people we really don't have to care about.
I will say, and this makes for interesting commentary, over the last week
or so, I've released those simple scripts for Pine (and today for Tin)
that integrate digital signing fairly seamlessly with those programs. I've received about 200 requests since Monday from people asking where to
find PGP, asking about similiar scripts for Windoze or Dos or Mac, or
thanking me for providing an easier way to do digital signatures.  And
that was a simple sh script!  Imagine if some people with REAL writing ability worked on some programs...
Pushing for wide use of digital signatures is one way to get PGP to be a "household" name for people writing on the net.  I now sign everything I post and mail.  It gets people's attention and interest.  Interest leads to use.
I think the politics of PGP is stagnated at about two years ago or so.  The demographics are no longer accepting to long technical rants.  Today's generation of net.user doesn't need 100% security 100% of the
time, what they need is "good" security when they want it, but in a way that they don't have to think much about.
Sorry if I'm ranting again abotu everything I said last week.  I'm in the
process of doing research on social evolution using the net as an example
of accelerated cultural change.  I'm kinda in a specific mindset right now

About two weeks ago, there was some talk in here with regards to holding DC lawmakers crominally liable for passign bad laws.  This was followed up with postins pointing out that you can't do that.
However, this morning I remembered something.
Whent he republicans took over the congress, they instidtued that Contract on America.   One of the first laws that was passed (by both parties, I might add) was a law that made lawmakers abide by the same laws that "normal" people abide by.
Does this change, in any fashion, the original idea?

@_subject: There's a hole in your crypto, dear Eliza dear Eliza... 
Alright, here's my 2 cents worth for this petty flamewar...
Once upon a time, there was PGP 2.3.  MIT had nothing to do with it.  The population of the net that used the program was fairly small.  In addition to being small, they were all (mostly) computer literate people.  These people were confident in the security of PGP because the had read and understood the source code.  It was checked and declared good. Then, in stepped MIT.
I, and a few others, raised concerns about a possible conflict of interest with MIT distributing the code, and encouraged everyone to double check the code for back doors and other NSA nasties.  It was checked and declared good.
Now, we are in the present.  MIT is still part of the equation.  However, the demographics of the net have chaged.  Fewer people are here that (by percentage) are computer literate to the level to do source code investigations.  A few question why they shoudl trust PGP when they don't know it's secure.  We, those who have grown up with PGP, point out that it is good, yet that really isn't a great reason to trust it.
So the question is, why shoudl non-technical people believe that PGP is good?  They don't have the skills to check it for themselves, and you have to admit that the associations of MIT with various TLAs are at the very least concerning.

I downloaded teh patch for the 32-bit windoze version and couldn't get it installed.  I had the old installation in the default C:\Program Files\Netscape\Navigator (with the space in the directory name), but every incarnation I tried, including the Progra~1 8.3 name couldn't be found.  I finally just stripped out the old an reinstalled the new.  Anooying but functional.  Please double check this in any future patches, or better yet, put in a seach utility that finds it for you, something like "Netscape was found in C:\Foo\Bar.  Patch here?"  If no, then search more until exhausted.
Sorry for the non-CP traffic, just trying to reach the right people the fastest. :-)

@_subject: Need a "warning" graphic of some kind for CDA 
Now that we all have web pages that are naughty and might be seen by little children, I'd like to hve some kind of a graphic that can universally be seen as a "Warning:  The following material is unsuitable for children and close-minded twits".  (or words to that effect).
Anybody with much more graphic design ability than I wanna take a crack at something that can be spread all over the net?  It shoudl poke as much fun as possible at the inaness of the CDA, while still being a legitimate effort to warn people that the material is offensive (just in case people start getting yanked off the street on CDA violations).

[Information abotu the EFF's Blue Ribbion campain deleted to save space]
What I was proposing was not he blue ribbion.  The ribbion is for supporting basic electronic rights.  What kind of graphic I was looking for was something that would serve as a universal warning saying "The following is naughty stuff, don't look here except at your own risk".  A combination of disclaimer and warning and tongue-in-cheek protest against the inane laws.  The Blue Ribbion is something different...

@_subject: Surf-filter lists 
ARGH!  I've been keeping quiet about this for a while, but I thing I gotta say something before I throttle my Zip drive...
A Private organization cannot "censor" anything.  The fundamental definition of the word require some agent of the government take action to censor.  To accuse Surf-Watch, net-nanny, AOL, MSU, AT&T, or whatever of "censorship" accomplishes nothing except to make us look the fool. I agree that the problem with the "bait-and-switch" filtering of net materials by these various filtering packages needs to be addressed.  If I want to protect my kids from seeing alt.naughty.pictures, I shoudl still be able to unfilter political and health speech.  The real problem isn't censorship, it's disclosure by the makers of filtering packages about what exactly their packages are going to filter for me and my family.  However, in the upcoming war of filtering packages (and it will get ugly) trade secrets are going to make any company hesitant to reveal what it is they are filtering and what criteria they are using to determine if something qualifies.

@_subject: Filtering out Queers is OK 
Uh, wait a second.  Libraries and Librarians are not acting in loco parentis.  The purpose of a librarian is to aid patrons in locating materials and to maintain the order of the library.  The Library Bill of Rights (which, of course, legally means nothing) guarantees access to any materials by any patron.  If little eight year old Johnny Doe comes and asks for _The Joy of Gay Sex_, a librarian is supposed to do nothing more that point Johnny to the "J" section.
Now, I am generalizing as SOME librarian do refuse to check materials some
might feel inappropriate, but that is not a librarian policy.  The Library
Establishment (ALA, basicly) believes in the idea that it is the parents
that should be responsible for what Little Johnny reads, not the
librarian. ____           Robert A. Hayden      <=> hayden at krypton.mankato.msus.edu

@_subject: Security of PGP if Secret Key Available? 
About once a week we get some lame-o flame bait posted to alt.security.pgp or this mailing list or somewhere abotu some hole in PGP.  We further say with fairly good reliability that they are bogus, get a light chuckle, and then go back to dealing with the real issues.
However, I got to wondering about the security of PGP assuming somebody trying to read my PGPed stuff has my 1024-bit secret key.  ie, if I have it on my personal computer, and somebody gets my secret key, how much less robust has PGP just become, and what are appropriate and reasonable steps to take to protect this weakness?

One of the professors in a different department is going to be doing a
symposium next week on censorship, with particular attention paid to
censorship and the internet.  She has asked me to whip up a quick web page
of resources that she can direct the participants too.
Unfortunately, beyond the basic (EFF, ACLU, CPSR) sites, I really don't
know of many good places to add in, and lack the time to do a thourgh
search. If you know of a site or three, can you take a moment to drop me an email
with them?  Would save a lot of time.
Thanks so much.

Welp, I've been on this list for a long, long time, since its inception
way back when.  I haven't posted much, lately; mostly lurking and watching
and, occasionally giggling at the foolishness that has gone on in recent
months (i'm a sociologist by education, so watch this list as a "culture
in motion" may someday make for an interesting paper :-). Ever since the
internet was shot in the foot by a pair of lawyers selling green cards, I
was waiting for the chaos to reach this list.  It's here now. I have no problems with the idea of moderating this list.  If people wanna
waste my time with SPAM and petty flamewars, they shoudl do it in an
appropriate forum.  I've been here since the beginning, and continue to be
here, because I have an interest in crypto, crypto policy, and the
politics surrounding it.  Not to irk my system administrator with a daily
dose of CypherSPAM coming through her system.
And if a don't like the moderation decisions, by golly I can go somewhere
else.  Nice thing is that anybody else can as well.

@_subject: A Spam Experiment 
Over the past two weeks I ran a little, completely non-scientific,
experiment to examine the propgation of spam.
First, I created a bogus mailing address that forwarded to my normal
address, allowing me to see the different "to" headers.
I then posted a single "test" message to six usenet newsgroups to act as
catalyst.  These were:
Over the next 72 hours, I received 28 pieces of spam, which I catagorize
as an unsolicited email attempting to sell me a product or service.  12 of these messages had an address indicating I could respond to have my
name removed from future mailings.  I responded carefully to each address,
but 4 of them bounced as an invalid address, no such domain, or other
problem (no route to host, probably because it was physcially
diconnected).  I also notied that the "reply-to" field had no relationship
with the address to request removal on all 12 of them.
The other 14 pieces of spam were replied to the "Reply-to:" field.  All
were bounced as "no such user" or "no such domain".  One postmaster wrote
with a canned form letter saying their domain had been put in as the
reply-to field unknown to them. Over the next 72 hours, I received an additional 49 pieces of spam,
including one that was 850k in size and another that was 421k.
This batch was NOT replied to in any way, although 17 of them did include
an address to reply to request removal.
Since the initial six days, there have been a total of 4 spam messages,
all of them were also ignored.  The last 72 hours have had zero spam.

@_subject: McVeigh 
Maybe it is just me, but I think the whole McVeigh trial issues aren't
about whether he did or didn't do it.  it's important, but my concerns are
more about the process the government used to prove it's case.
It's built this huge circumstantial case, sprinkled liberally with weeping
mothers and children, added with a couple of witnesses who would probably
say anything to avoid execution.
None of it actually proved he DID it, just that it was possible. When a person can be convicted by sympathy, twisted circumstantial
evidence, and testimony given under threat of execution, you have to
wonder about the _process_ in this country, and th idea of trial by an
impartial body.
In my gut, I think he probably did do it, but I cannot see how the
prosecutors proved it beyond a "reasonable doubt".
Considering the testimony that is going to be allowed for the penalty
phase, I cannot forsee any verdict other than death.
