@_subject: Clipper "voluntary" like taxes are? 
On the front page of the 6/29/94 WSJ there is mention of the fact that the
IRS chief refers to the US tax system as "voluntary".  I had heard this
"voluntary" before.  So at about 3:20 today I called the IRS at
1-800-tax-1040 to ask if this was correct.  After about 40 minutes on hold
(fortunately I have a computer to keep me busy) I got someone.  They said
that, yes, the US does have a "voluntary compliance" tax system.  They
said that I could find the tax codes saying this in the local library.  I
tried to pin down why they used the word "voluntary".  After asking a
couple questions I said, "but if we don't comply there are penalties,
right?", they said yes, then I said, "so why is it voluntary?" and they
hung up on me.
Since this same government says that Clipper is "voluntary" I am worried
that they mean some new Orwellian definition of "voluntary" and not the old
fashioned "voluntary" many of us might have assumed.  Voluntary used to
mean things like "without legal obligation" and such (see below).  Get a copy of PGP while you can,

             voluntarily (-taruh-lee) --adv.
             voluntariness --n.
Etymology    ME < Lat. voluntarius < voluntas, choice < velle, to wish.
Domain       Literature, Rhetoric, Philosophy, Law, Music
Synonyms     voluntary, intentional, deliberate, willful, willing, spontaneous.
             These adjectives mean unforced. Voluntary is applied in several
             related senses to what is done by choice, to physical movement
             subject to regulation by the will, and less often to action that
             is not only of one's choice but premeditated. The last-named
             sense is more basic to intentional and deliberate; in addition,
             deliberate stresses the idea of action taken with full awareness
             of the consequences. Willful can mean merely in accordance with
             one's will but often implies headstrong persistence in a self-
             determined course of action. Willing suggests acceding to a
             course proposed by another, without reluctance or even eagerly.
             Spontaneous refers to behavior that seems wholly unpremeditated,
             a natural response and a true reflection of one's feelings.

PRIVACY & OFFSHORE BANKING: What the IRS doesn't want you to know!
By David Johnson
I'll get right to the point!  The purpose of this brief article is to take a
look at banking and investing overseas, using fiscal tax shelters (havens) to reduce and eliminate taxes, and foremost, to provide confidentiality in personal and business matters.  Period.
For various reasons, offshore banking has been tagged as "unsafe", "risky", "illegal", or "for the wealthy".  All are anything but the truth!  It's time to dispell the myths!  Let's seperate the fact from the bull!  First off, one must understand that it is normal for those who know little or nothing about something (besides what they hear from others) to be afraid and suspicious of it.  Misinformed financial planners, attorneys and accountants may know economics and law in the United States, but few know about handling business outside of the country.  Let's tackle these misconceptions one at a time:
LEGALITY - There isn't and will never be a law restricting the sending of funds outside the United States.  How do I know?  Simple.  As a country dependant on international trade (billions of dollars a year and counting), the American economy would be destroyed.  How?  Since all U.S. global trade is transacted in U.S. Dollars, there would be no imports or exports, due to
the fact that the United States would not be able to buy and sell goods.  Make sense?  If you wanted to, you could remove or transfer some (or all) of your money our of your bank or credit union to anywhere in the world, LEGALLY.  U.S. banks and the IRS disseminate negative propaganda dealing with offshore banking, making it seem unsafe or some type of criminal act.  Why?  Banks just want to keep your money in their institutions to use for thieir own profitable purposes.  Did you know that most U.S. banks themselves accept deposits from people overseas and often invest in foreign stocks and hold accounts with foreign banks?  It's true!  As far as the IRS, they obviously want your money
in U.S. banks where they can tax every dollar you earn in interest, and keep track of how many liquid assets you have and where they are.
The confusion with tax legalities is sometimes due to lack of knowledge.  In the U.S., tax evasion is a crime, tax avoidance is not.  As you know, there are zillions of laws on the books in every country.  Without a doubt, what is legal in one place may be against the law elsewhere.  For example, income tax evasion is not a crime in jurisdictions where there is no income tax.  Thus,  in most cases (except those with significant political and/or business weight) countries that are not allies usually don't assist other nations in enforcing laws that are not laws in their countries.  Further, a country has no legal right to conduct an investigation in a foreign country, without consent of the respective government.  In reality, a country has every right to deny ANY other nation permission to make examinations in their territory.  Therefore, it is difficult, if not impossible for authorities in the U.S. to obtain
financial transaction records of tax evaders in many foreign-based institutions (outside of those located in areas that have some type of
cooperation treaties).  Strict banking secrecy laws also contribute to the
difficulty. Most tax haves impose lengthy prison terms and/or hefty fines for violations of a client's secrecy.  INTER-FIPOL (The International Fiscal Police) is the tax crime equivalent of INTERPOL (The International Police Organization), which is a network of law enforcement authorities in numerous countries which exchange information on criminals.  Many evaders are opening accounts in fictitious names and using mail fowarding & pick-up drops for privacy.
PRACTICALITY - Movie-makers and recent international scandals, such as BCCI and Iran-Contra, have contributed to negative views about offshore banking.  Contrary to popular belief, rich criminals and corrupt government officials
make up a small segment of the total number of customers at any given offshore
institution.  Now more than ever, the average American blue-collar worker and businessman is using offshore banking as a way to reduce taxes (through legal
avoidance).  Many accounts may be opened for the same amount required in the U.S (about $100) or less.  In some cases, there is no minimum opening deposit at all.  Further, the interest rates are usually substantially higher than in the U.S. (since federal law sets limits on the amount of interest a bank can pay you).  But by far, the reason most people turn to offshore banks is their One might ask, "if these banks are so good, why don't they advertise in the U.S."?  The answer is simple...they are prohibited!  Federal law restricts offshore banks from advertising their services in U.S. magazines and newspapers,
unless they agree to the same restrictions that govern F.D.I.C. institutions
(such as interest limitation).  Why?  That's simple too...to keep competition down.  Opening an account with these banks is as simple as writing a formal
letter to the institution and  requesting information about their various
services and the appropriate application forms, and returning them to the bank.
It really that easy!  Most banks never have to see you in person.
SAFETY - All offshore banks are regulated in one form or another, like their U.S. counterparts, but minus the limiting federal laws.  Less restrictive regulations abroad allow foreign banks more freedom in locating the best investments worldwide, allowing them to pass on and share their profits with their customers.  As for insurance, forget the F.D.I.C. or other private insurance companies!  They usually only allow a liquidity factor (insurance) of about 10% of public deposits.  Many offshore banks are self-insured, meaning they have AT LEAST one dollar in cash to coverevery dollar on deposit, That translates to 100%+ insurance.  Also, the majority of the world largest and strongest banks (as far as assets) are overseas, not in the United States.  Call your local library's business & finance or commercial department and ask
the librarian to look it up.  INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) - Treasury form 90.22-1 (Report of Foreign Bank
and Financial Accounts must, by law, be completed and returned to the I.R.S. by
June 30th of each year you possess a foreign account.  For a copy of the form,
call the IRS at (800) 829-1040, or check your phone directory for the number of
your nearest forms distribution center.
U.S. CUSTOMS - U.S. Department of Treasury's Currency and Foreign Transactions
Reporting Act details which monetary instruments (checks, money orders, ect.) must, by law, be reported to the federal government.  A copy of an illustrated circular which explains the act in full is available for the cost of $5 from: Worldwide Consultants, 2421 W. Pratt Blvd., Suite 971, Chicago, IL 60645 U.S.A.
WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO REPORT - Here are two categories of instruments that you
are not required to report: If you make out a personal check or money order to an offshore bank, you don't have to report it.
And, if you have a check or money order payable to you, you may restrictively endorse it (i.e. pay to the order of XYZ Bank), and you do not have to report it
TAX EVASION - If you deposit your paycheck in a U.S. bank, chances are you've
already paid income taxes on it (unless it is a personal check).  So, you have
no further obligations, since taxes were deducted before the check even hit your
hand.  With a savings or brokerage account, at the end of the year when you get
your annual statement, you simply add the total amount of interest or profit
earned to your income, and pay taxes on the grand total.  The same is only
true offshore if the country the bank is located in imposes a withholding tax.
Since I'm on the subject of taxes, did you know that the United States and the Philippines are the only two nations in the world that tax income earned outside of their countries?  Anyway...back to tax evasion.  Below are a few examples of ways some individuals have cheated the IRS:
A lawyer received payment by personal check from a client and deposited it
in his offshore account.  Since the deposit didn't appear on his business
reords, the chances are it would never be found out (even if he was audited).
One couple sold a valuable antique and had the buyer send the payment directly
to their offshore bank account.  Later the couple used the money to tour Europe and the Carribean.
Another example is the S&L bank customer who enticed his "unscrupulous" banker
to electronically transfer a large sum of cash offshore without reporting the transaction to the I.R.S..  Then the customer borrowed the money back from the
offshore bank.  Since loan proceeds are not taxable, no taxes were paid.
These types of schemes are no longer used by the rich with extra money to hide,
but by average Americans who don't like to pay taxes on every single cent they
HOW HIDDEN ASSETS ARE FOUND - Having conducted investigations in the
U.S. and abroad, I am familiar with the various techniques which may
be used to locate leads to funds being kept offshore.  Here are a few:
1.  Checking passports (and travel agents) for evidence of visits to "high
profile" destinations such as: Switzerland, Cayman Islands, The Bahamas, Isle
of Man, Netherland Antilles, and other known banking and tax havens.  Travel to these type of areas nwill surely throw up a red flag, giving seekers a
place to start looking for your assets.
2.  Examining telephone (home, business & hotel), fax and mobile (cellular)
phone records to identify undisclosed business connections and contacts.
3.  Reviewing credit card statements to determine who you do business with,
where you travel (domestic & foreign), and what products and services you use.
These records leave a revealing paper trail miles long.
4.  Garbage is often sifted through for information such as statements, invoices, correspondence, and other relevant material useful in tracking your
affairs.  Use a high-quality paper shredder, discard your garbage at another
location, or burn and crush it.  It sounds drastic, but what you throw away
says a lot about you, and many leads can be found there.
5.  Compiling a list of parties that you have a relationship with (business or
otherwise) by recording the return addresses on your incoming mail.  This
technique can disclose friends, associates and partners.  If you must receive
important mail at your residence or business address, be sure to have your correspondents omit using a return address.
6.  Looking into banking transactions.  All withdrawals or deposits $3,000 or
more must be reported by your bank to the federal government, whether made by
cash, check or electronic transfer.  Keep transactions under $3,000.
7.  Checking private courier's logs (UPS, DHL, RPS, Federal Express, Airborne
Express, ect.) for delivery of special or important letters and packages.
8.  Examining telex records of your company or business to locate areas of foreign activities.

@_subject: www for cypherpunks' collection 
I exchanged email with Eric Johnson about his database a few days ago.
He has had some sort of problem and does not have the time to fix it,
so his database is down till further notice.  This is too bad, as it
was a fantastic resource.
Sometime back someone mentioned that they now had their own workstation
on the net and were willing to do something, like make it available for
the Cyperpunk Electronic Book idea.  I think it would be really good to
have a permanent archive site to make all of the cypherpunk mail
available via FTP.  If they, or someone else, have the disk space to do
this, it would be a very good thing.  Along with making the mail
directly available, a permanent archive would let mosaic pages
reference any mail.

It is just a battle victory, and the war is not over, but the advantage is now ours.
If today they forced everyone to use Clipper chips, we could now do so and still not let the government tap in.
If some company wants to use government subsidized hardware to have
very high speed encryption, they could do so with security.
As Adam/Hall said, Blaze's work is better than pre-encryption in that
the government can not even get unit IDs.
As Perry said, you can interoperate with someone who isn't attempting
to avoid escrow. This flaw, along with the recent DSS flaw, undermine the confidence
people had in the NSA.  This will slow down Clipper.
In terms of controlling encryption in general, the government train has
been switched onto a dead-end track.   If they decide to go back
through the standards acceptance again, it could be a long time before
there are products.  The rest of the industry will not wait - PGP etc
are moving along rapidly.  So the government position is either live
with a flawed chip, or go back for a probably fatal delay.  Either way,
they loose.
It is a big deal, and we do have cause to party!!!!!   :-)

@_subject: Tax Free In Cyberspace Only 
Encryption will have a profound impact on society as we move further into
the information age.  In particular, some things that are currently taxed
will be very hard to tax in the future.
Encryption lets non-tangible things move around like the ghosts they
are.  Since this movement is ininvisible, it will be impossible to tax.
So things which can exist in cyberspace will tend to move around tax
free.  This will include things like:
   Securities     - stocks, bonds, mutual funds
   Savings        - cash
   Profits        -    Information    - newsletters, magazines, databases
   Software       -
This non-taxability comes from the fact that only the parties exchanging
something in cyberspace even need to know about the exchange - and they
can encrypt everything so that nobody else knows.  It also comes from the
fact that the entities involved in commerce in cyberspace can be located
anyplace in the physical world and there are many places that do not tax
Tangible things within the territory of some government will always be
taxable by that government.  This is especially true for things where
it is desirable to have a government issued "title".  Major tax
categories will still include:
   Real-estate    - land, houses, buildings, factories
   Vehicles       - cars, boats, planes
   Tangible goods - any objects bought or sold
   Fuel           - gas, diesel, jet fuel
   People         - poll tax
   Companies      - annual registration of corporations
Income for self employed information workers will be hard to tax.  However, for a number of years yet, most incomes will still be taxed. So governments will have to rework their tax base.  National sales taxes
or VATs will probably be more common.  Taxes on dividends, interest,
capital gains, etc., will fade away.
This change will be difficult, and probably the technology will move faster than the governments can comfortably react.  Instead of adapting to
the changes, many governments will probably try to prevent them.  These
attempts will fail - probably not even slowing things down much.
The cyberspace economy will be very close to pure capitalism.  Regulation
of cyberspace trade will be impossible.  It will not be possible to even
determine if two parties are doing business, let alone to stop them.
Initiation of force in cyberspace should be less and less of a problem as
computer systems get more secure.  Impersonation is easily prevented with
digital signatures.
This new tax base may not let governments operate in the manner to which
they have become accustomed.  Each government will be faced with the
choice of either printing more money (causing painful inflation), or
making painful cuts in programs.  This will no doubt cause some protests
and unrest, but certainly need not result in anarchy.     -- Vince Cate

 Vince Cate's Perpetual Traveler Page Welcome to
Vince Cate's perpetual traveler page.
Send comments to me at vac at cs.cmu.edu.
The "Perpetual Traveler" can be a "Previous Taxpayer".
People traveling through a country do not have to pay income
taxes etc. while they are in that country, even if they are
there for 3 to 9 months (depends on country).  If you can work over the net, it is possible to work from anyplace.  The IRS says that a US citizen has to be out of the country for 330 days of the year to not owe any taxes on your first $70,000.  So by moving from country to country you can legally avoid taxes.  A home that can move around the world is not really more expensive than home that does not move.  For example, the
65 foot long sailboat the "MacGregor 65" is only $149,000 new.
This is a good price, and that is probably why they can say
"best selling large yacht in history".  One family, or 2 couples, could be very comfortable on a boat of this size.  It will do over 10 knots under power and 20 under sail.  For free information
from MacGregor call (714) 642-6830.
After the 3 months, or whatever, that the country will let you
visit, you can pull up anchor and go on to another country.
At 250 miles per day, it would not take long to get to another country, especially in the Carribean where some island
countries are 20 miles apart.
Boats cost a bit more to operate/upkeep than a house, but they do not have property tax.  In PA the property tax is about 3%. For a house as expensive as the MacGregor 65 this is $4,500/year.
Note that a self employed person inside the USA needs to earn like $9,000 to have enough "after tax" money to pay $4,500 property tax.  If you only move the boat 4 times a year, the annual costs are probably between these two numbers.
You can always rent out a room on your boat.  Strange as it sounds,
it seems you can charge more for the rent of one room than you would
be paying in mortgage payments for the whole boat.  So with this type of life style, one need not hassle with social security tax, income tax, health tax, property tax, investment taxes, etc.  On top of having far more money and freedom, you don't have the paperwork!
At this time there is no mailing list for exactly this topic, but there are 2 mailing lists that are probably of interest.   flotilla mailing list
is for a group of people that plan to all share one full internet
connection by keeping their boats within radio range of each other.
The second is the live-aboard mailing list
for people that either live on boats or want to.
I keep a file on how to get wireless email while you are on your boat.
Charles Vollum wrote up an article on how to use ham radio for email. I also have a list of banks good for world travelers and a cypherpunk page. Vincent Cate

@_subject: WWW Acronyms (was Re: Cypherpunks' mail database does exist) 
Gary Jeffers:
The "http" is for "Hyper-Text Transport Protocol".  This is not FTP,
though it is a protocol similar in function to FTP.  It is used by
"WWW" (World Wide Web) of which Mosaic is the most popular
implementation.  If you have Mosaic, you can just give the above path.
If you do not have mosaic, you should spend some time trying to get it.
Mosaic makes it really easy to quickly move through lots of information
on the net.  Mosaic is a point and click hypertext interface.  You
can FTP to ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu and go into Mosaic.
You also have a typo, it is "Cypherpunks.src" with a capital C.
WWW has a simple language for writting your own hypertext documents -
"HTML" (Hyper Text Markup Language).  You can think of this as sort of
like Troff, LaTeX or Postscript, but for hypertext documents.  One page
of HTML can make dozens of normal files easy to access. For example, my
README.html security page points to many normal files:
     ftp://furmint.nectar.cs.cmu.edu/security/README.html
It turns out that the mail database is really in "WAIS" (Wide Area
Information Server).  You can use WAIS directly, though I think it is
easier to use through mosaic.  To use WAIS you would do:
 ws -h pmip.maricopa.edu -d cpindex/Cypherpunks The "ws" may be "waissearch" on your system.  You can get lots of info
on WAIS from ftp://wais.think.com/comp.infosystems.wais-FAQ
As someone pointed out, this "http" method does not yet work with
"lynx" (a text only implementation of WWW) on the cypherpunks mail
database.  It seems it will take a new version of lynx or WAIS for this
to work.  But the Unix "xmosaic" works fine. :-)
This form of global filename starting with something like "ftp://",
" "gopher://" etc is also part of the WWW architecture.
These names are called "URLs" for Universal Resource Locator.
Well, that is probably enough acronyms for today.  :-)

The version of the file fips181.txt with DES code, which was FTPable
from a government machine, (I saw it there some time back myself) has
been exported.  It is now FTPable from the UK.  I did not see a "NO-EXPORTING" warning like most of us have, so they
could have even caused someone to violate US law unintentionally.
Maybe even someone who thinks that US law applies to everyone on Earth.
So even if someone were to export something from one of our FTP sites,
we still would not be doing something as bad as the government has

@_subject: Using "nobody" to camouflage encryption/remailers/commerce 
If we use "nobody" as an email address we can hide remailers or make it
seem like there were remailers where there are not, etc.
The convention on the Internet is for mail to "nobody" to go to
"/dev/null".  This is used as a return address when you don't want bounced
Now remailer operators are clearly more interested in privacy than in
following conventions.  Imagine remailers also had addresses like
"nobody at vox.hacktic.nl", and "nobody at jpunix.com".  Now if someone doing
an internet wire-tap sees mail to "nobody at furmint.nectar.cs.cmu.edu" it
is hard for him to tell if this means:
  a) It will just end up in /dev/null like it does on 99% of the machines
  b) furmint is another remailer
  c) someone on furmint gets mail as "nobody"
  d) furmint acts as a remailer for those with money
  e) furmint is being used for some email based business
  f) etc
So now assume that there was a lot of encrypted mail going to
"nobody at alex.sp.cs.cmu.edu".  That might be because I am also doing
something funny there, or it might be because someone is just sending a
lot of encrypted mail to /dev/null.  By the way, anyone is welcome to send
encrypted mail to this address (via a remailer or not).  Even if there is
no email going out of that machine, it could just be that with my remailer
I collect the mail some period into a file, encrypt the file, move it
off to some other machine (using FTP, NFS, uucp, rcp, http, telnet, etc.),
and mail it from there.  Could be hard to tell.
Remailers named "nobody" will be harder to stop.  So it would be nice
if sites with remailers would set the "nobody" alias to point to their
remailer to start this convention.  Assuming that the remailer will
drop non-encrypted mail (or at least mail that does not have a good
format) this should not cause any problems.
On "furmint" I did the following:
   Changed the "nobody:/dev/null" in /usr/misc/.mmdf/table/aliases    to "nobody:vac+pgp at furmint.nectar.cs.cmu.edu".    Ran "dbmbuild" to rebuild the "mmdf" database.
I don't know how different this will be on other Unixes.  It may only take
editing "/usr/lib/aliases" on other systems.
So I did give away the puzzle in the second paragraph, if you send mail to
"nobody at furmint.nectar.cs.cmu.edu" it is the same as sending mail to
"vac+pgp at cs.cmu.edu".  So far.  :-)
I doubt that "nobody" was getting a lot of mail, but if so I will modify
my "pgp-receive" script to drop any mail not encrypted for it.
If they ever outlaw sending mail to "nobody" there will be millions of
people who are breaking the law.
If some country outlaws encryption, people (or programs) in other
countries could send encrypted mail to "nobody" at random machines in that
country to act as a cover for the legitimate encrypted mail.

@_subject: MAIL: Using "nobody" 
Karl Lui Barrus:
Yes, you need to be root. When I do this to different machines where "nobody" is aliased to
different things, I always get "Nice address".
But even if there was some way to tell by accessing something on my
machine, I can make my machine lie.  Really.  Do I need to get my
machine to lie for me?  Can anyone detect any difference between the
"nobody"s on cs.cmu.edu, furmint.nectar.cs.cmu.edu, and
It does not need to be all of them to work.  Even if only a few places
do this, it is still good cover. If there is some mail going to "nobody" on my machine, maybe I have
some "black-net" operation running off of my machine, or maybe mail is
all getting dropped in the bit bucket like "nobody" on standard
machines.  From outside you can not be sure.  It could just be L. D. trying to make it look like I am up to something.  If there was a witch hunt for encryption use, someone might send lots
of encrypted mail to someplace like nobody at att.att.com, and the fierce
witch hunters might try to burn someone who was not a true witch.

 Using PGP/PEM encryption
This document is formatted roughly like a FAQ. Here are the section headings:    What is PGP/PEM encryption?    How are they used in HTTP?    What do I need to use it?    How do the keys get distributed?    How bulletproof is it?    Installation: server side.    Installation: client side.    What does the protocol look like? What is PGP/PEM encryption?
PGP and PEM are programs to allow you and a second party to communicate
in a way which does not allow third parties to read them, and which
certify that the person who sent the message is really who they claim
they are. PGP and PEM both use RSA encryption. The U.S. government has strict
export controls over foreign use of this technology, so people outside
the U.S. may have a difficult time finding programs which perform the
encryption. How are they used in HTTP?
We have implemented a system by which NCSA Mosaic and NCSA httpd call
external programs which encrypt and decrypt their communications and
thus provide secure communications between the server and the client
and ensure that a user is who he/she says they are. This system
currently has hooks for PEM encryption as well as PGP encryption. As
interest in this area grows, more will most likely be added. What do I need to use it?
You will need a working copy of either Pretty Good Privacy or RIPEM to
begin with. You should be familiar with the program and have generated
your own public/private key pair. You should be able to use the TIS/PEM program with the PEM
authorization type. I haven't tried it. This tutorial is written
assuming that you are using RIPEM. How do the keys get distributed?
Currently, we have implemented this protocol with PEM and PGP using
local key files on the server side, and on the client side with PEM
using finger to retrieve the server's public key. As you can tell, parties who wish to use Mosaic and httpd with PEM or
PGP encryption will need to communicate beforehand and find a
tamper-proof way to exchange their public keys. How bulletproof is it?
Pioneers get shot full of arrows. This work is currently in the
experimental stages and thus may have some problems that I have
overlooked. There aren't any that I can see but I've been looking at it
for a long time. There may be some quirks in the additions to Mosaic
and httpd as well. In particular, error recovery is not always as
helpful as it could be. The only known problem that I know about is that the messages are
currently not timestamped. This means that a malicious user could
record your encrypted message with a packet sniffer and repeat it back
to the server ad nauseum. Although they would not be able to read the
reply, if the request was something you were being charged for, you may
have a large bill to pay by the time they're through. Installation: The Server Side
First, you must compile httpd with CFLAGS set to -DPEM_AUTH. This will
enable the PEM and PGP authentication directives. Next, look in the support/auth directory. This directory contains your
encryption and decryption scripts, as well as bins for your remote
users' public keys. Edit ripem-dec, ripem-enc, pgp-enc, and pgp-dec and follow the
instructions therein. You need not set up PGP if you don't plan to use
it, and same with RIPEM. Now, edit your server configuration file, usually conf/httpd.conf. You
will want to add three new directives for PGP and three new directives
for PEM depending on which you plan to use (or both). PEMEncryptCmd /usr/local/etc/httpd/auth/ripem-enc
PGPEncryptCmd /usr/local/etc/httpd/auth/pgp-enc
These directives change what executables httpd will look for when it is
trying to encrypt its reply to a client. Edit the pathnames to taste.
PEMDecryptCmd /usr/local/etc/httpd/auth/ripem-dec
PGPDecryptCmd /usr/local/etc/httpd/auth/pgp-dec
These directives change what executables httpd will look for when it is
trying to decrypt the client's request. PEMServerEntity webmaster at foobar.org
PGPServerEntity webmaster at foobar.org
These directives set your entity name. This should be the same as the
name you place on the public/private keys you generate for your server.
If you make these directives different than the key names, your server
and its client will become hopelessly confused. You are now ready to protect directories of your server with this
authorization scheme. For a directory you want to protect, you should first set its AuthType.
Use AuthType PGP for a directory you are protecting with PGP and
AuthType PEM for a directory you are protecting with PEM.
The require directive accepts key names as its arguments. The
AuthGroupFile directive is valid as well, to create groups of keys. A
full example: AuthType PEM
AuthGroupFile /httpd/.htgroup-pem
Options None
require user robm at ncsa.uiuc.edu
require group pemusers
Let's say /httpd/.htgroup-pem reads: pemusers: pls at ncsa.uiuc.edu In this case, this directory will be
protected with PEM encryption and will require that only users
robm at ncsa.uiuc.edu and pls at ncsa.uiuc.edu be allowed to access that
directory. Installation: the Client Side
First, get a copy of Mosaic/X 2.2. If it hasn't been released yet, be
patient. Compile it with -DPEM_AUTH to enable PEM/PGP authentication.
Follow the instructions in each of the scripts in the auth subdirectory
to customize them to your setup. There are six new X resources which have been defined for PEM/PGP
authentication.  They are: Mosaic*pemEncrypt: /X11/robm/Mosaic/auth/ripem-enc
Mosaic*pemDecrypt: /X11/robm/Mosaic/auth/ripem-dec
Mosaic*pemEntity: robm at ncsa.uiuc.edu
Mosaic*pgpEncrypt: /X11/robm/Mosaic/auth/pgp-enc
Mosaic*pgpDecrypt: /X11/robm/Mosaic/auth/pgp-dec
Mosaic*pgpEntity: robm at ncsa.uiuc.edu
You should change the Encrypt and Decrypt entries to reflect where you
are going to install your encryption and decryption crypts. You should
change the Entity lines to the key name you have given the server
maintainers for yourself. If you don't, bad things will happen. What does the protocol look like?
This protocol is almost word-for-word a copy of Tony Sander's RIPEM
based scheme, generalized a little. Below, wherever you see PEM you can
replace it with PGP and get the same thing.
Client: GET /docs/protected.html HTTP/1.0
UserAgent: Mosaic/X 2.2
Server: HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: PEM entity="webmaster at hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu"
Server: NCSA/1.1
Client: GET / HTTP/1.0
Authorization: PEM entity="robm at ncsa.uiuc.edu"
--- BEGIN PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE ---
this is the real request, encrypted
--- END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE ---
Server: HTTP/1.0 200 OK
--- BEGIN PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE ---
this is the real reply, encrypted
--- END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE ---
That's it. Almost all of this stuff is my fault (including the implementations),
so direct comments about it to me. Rob McCool, robm at ncsa.uiuc.edu

@_subject: "Email-Firewalls" / Instant Corporate PGP 
Companies like the idea of firewall machines to protect the security of
their internal nets.  I bet they would also like something called an
"email-firewall".  Names are important. :-)  I think of the
email-firewall as a slightly modified anonymous-remailer.
Outsiders could send encrypted mail to the remailer and it would
decrypt it and send it on to the right person inside the company over
internal (more secure) nets.
The email-firewall could also encrypt outgoing mail when it was going
to a person who either had a listed PGP key or who was working at
another company with an email-firewall.
Also, this remailer would not make the mail anonymous.  Corporations
need security, not anonimity.
Each company would only need to buy one copy of ViaCrypt PGP.  For a
company this cost is, of course, negligible.
With this people inside the company would not need to deal with the
encryption directly.  They getting encrypted mail would not take
anything new, and sending might take a slight change.
Of course this is only a step towards true end-to-end encryption, but
it is easy and far better than what they have now.  Also, it fits with
the way companies work.  There is a security guard at the entrance to
the plant, but once inside people generally trust each other and don't
worry about security.  With this, internal mail is still like
postcards, but external would have an envelope.  I thought about this after making a short script (below) so that mail
to vac+pgp at cs.cmu.edu (the low security envelope) would be decrypted
automatically.  This also needed the following line in my .maildelivery:
Addr vac+pgp          pipe ? /usr/vac/pgp/incoming
I am not going to make the "email-firewall" at this time, but thought I
would throw the idea out.  Has anyone done this?   Let me know if you

Interesting.  There are Swiss banks on the Internet.  So we can update
with a few Internet domains.  See below.  If I run "whois" on Panama, Antigua, or Grenada (a few tax havens) I get something interesting.  The output of these is at the bottom of this file.
As Jim Hart mentions below, there is a book called "Tax Havens" by
Hoyt L. Barber that was published in 1993 by McGraw-Hill.  Probably
any local bookstore can order it for you.  I recommend the book.
I will keep this file as:
  /alex/edu/cmu/cs/nectar/furmint/security/banks
Which is also:
  ftp://furmint.nectar.cs.cmu.edu/security/banks
If people send me other interesting and related info, I will add it to this file.

The pgp26-RSAREF_3.0_beta.tar.gz file is not real.  From some other
post, it seems this came from the site in Italy that I mentioned awhile
back.  They have removed the file from there.  It is a lot of bytes
for a joke.  It should probably be removed from soda too.
