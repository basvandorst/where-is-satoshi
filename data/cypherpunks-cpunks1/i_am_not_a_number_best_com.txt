@_subject: Wow. 
i have no doubt that a certain amount of the noise on this list is
the work of agents provocateurs ... and we should just live with
it because its entire intent is a certain kind of denial-of-service
just ket used to taking extra time and using the delete function a lot.
there's still a lot on the list you don't get elsewhere.
ah..... if i only had my natural lang. agent running!

@_subject: One time pads and randomness? 
as i have writ before, the sources i have read say that digits of the transcendentals are THOUGHT to be uniformly
and 'randomly' distributed --- in quotes because there are
many criteria for randomness and i don't mean to imply a specific one.  however, this supposision is no stronger
than a conjecture.  has not been proven, AFAIK.
