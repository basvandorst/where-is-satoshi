[Augusto] Well... how many people don't understand SSL and still use it for
home banking?
[Augusto] Code signing might be an option, but (a) who is going to sign the
code (governement, parties, independent organizations, all of them), and (b)
how is this code signature *securely* verified?
[Augusto] One can still maintain public sites for casting votes, using the
same "MyVote" system and identifying themselves with smartcards.
[Augusto] Same as above [SSL].
[Augusto] I would like to see this happening after the scientific/academic
community approves a secure protocol and its implementation architecture.
And I also understand that it will be quite hard to convince the general
voter of the security of e-voting.

Hi all,
I need to implement a C++ client (Linux) which must connect to an HTTP
Server using SSL (HTTPS). Which libraries could I possibly use,
considering both SSL and HTTP?

@_subject: CDR: Signing data in IE 
Hi all,
I've been able to sign data in an HTML form (prior to sending it to the
Web server) using crypto.SignText (Netscape Navigator JavaScript
function). However, I haven't found a way to do the same thing in Internet
Has anyone got any ideas?

@_subject: CDR: Permutations in DES 
Hi all,
I was just wondering... In DES, there's an Initial Permutation (IP) on the plaintext, then 16 rounds, and then the inverse permutation (IP^-1) of the result to produce the ciphertext.
How effective are these permutations? Do they really add diffusion to the algorithm, considering that they don't depend on the key?
Someone told me that they are necessary to provide reversibility to DES. Is this correct?
Thanks in advance,
Best Regards,
