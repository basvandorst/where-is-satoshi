One of you does have a BIG problem. Either you are subscribed to some spam corporation with no way to contact them, or you are just using this list to raise awarness about some corporation by making others look for solutions for you. Or is it something else?

sometimes in a VERY misleading paragraph, than leaves some uninformed
geeks debate about the misleading text.

My bad. For me English is a second language. But «fucks us in the arse»
implies a deliberate act. I see your domain is from Poland, which is
quite a backward country when it comes to anything people do, yet a pope
disaproves. Meaning anal sex, heterosexual, homosexual or plain
masturbation is a very very bad thing to do. I might be wrong, but in
this context «GMail fucks us in the arse» implies at least malice. Yet
now you write «I am not assuming malice on Google's part». Help me
How can anybody draw the line? It's fine as long as they are under an
arbitrary value set by WHOM, but it's wrong after that?
Than they should break Avaaz.
If one company depends so much on another, than you can call the first
one a parasyte. If it's existence depends on Google, than they should
ask nicely and maybe forward a nice sum of money. Or they have quite
some nerve to try to impose rules from the position of parasyte.
Hopefuly for you their niche might be filled afterwards by a company
that can stand on its own.
Don't you think that is for the people to decide?
Because they way you expressed it, as I have no idea what Avaaz is or
does, they are a puny corporation living from Google's leftovers. Meaning Google does a good thing for their users.

I realised that my last few hours were in defence of Google. I'm not. I'm just against the vocal minority forcing some third party to do something just because it feels right to that minority. So the talk is one based on principle.
I used to have a Gmail account, a separate Youtube account and yet another for Picasa. They are all gone. And I can say it was qick and clean. Something I can't say even for sites perceived as good such as Ubuntu Forums.
But most webmail providers give some options. Such as do not make spam out of addresses that are in Contacts. Even those who don't offer this option explicitly, make malware links available far easier for people that I have in Contacts. One can also make sorting rules. A mail failing this most probably is spam. Even if the receiver doesn't feel that.
Now that is something quite different. Do you feel it's about the same? How come?
Yes. Of course.
You see, I might be very upset with the contract I am given to sign by the power company. They [the company] say clauses are non negotiable, even if I feel they [the clauses] are abusive. My alternatives are to move in a different country or use solar panels and light the room with candles. Although very romantic in this eco concept, that might turn very expensive. So I feel having access to power is very important. And I am left with filing with the consumer protection agencies hoping enough people are bothered by those clauses.
On the other hand I can use Google or I can search a provider in India. I can use Vmail.me which is in France even if the name says Montenegro, and I can try Riseup which swear they won't give data, although the law specified they have to obey. And I do. I have accounts with all of them. In other words people stay with gmail because they like the server and don't care about what has been written in every newspaper in the so called Western world. It's not for me to decide for them, or I'd become some sort of Stalin. Today I rule what Google should do, tomorrow I am going to tell you what you should do.
I didn't know that. Thank you for the information.
And yes, to me it sounds like a good idea what Google is said to be doing. Although I have my doubts Google targets anyone in particular. Finding a good site, reading about a good cause and getting involved seems like the thing to do. Bleeding people out of microsums that seem harmless on a huge scale usually helps the few full time employees and little more.

Ok. I think I get the point.
My question was if they can, given the US law, do such a thing. You have repeated the previous statements.
I offer encryption means precisely «I offer encryption». If there is a full stop after that, than the rest is fantasy.
Take for example the fact that I do full disk encryption. I have the key somewhere. Now. Someone who has the key and the hard drive has access just like without full disk encryption. Including files that I have deleted through the regular delete and not some secure method. This does not make my hard drive any less encrypted than it is.
Now take another example: food containing dead pig meat sold in an islamic country as chicken or just «meat». In the first case it's a lie, it might as well write «no meat at all». In the second is a lie by omission.
Do not confuse the two cases. Google never ever stated the rest. It's just your imagination.
Have they said «we protect your data from the government»? I am sure to have missed that one. Same goes for the other scenarios mentioned.
You are strange.
They do not have to. Most important providers are bugged BEFORE the data reaches their servers. So it's first the Men in Black. Than is the server. Than is my computer.
On the other hand you have the power of law. Once there is a data storage one can ask a judge to write a special kind of legal letter to which the storage manager HAS to comply. So the whole chain starting with the investigator and ending with the judge couldn't care less about key, algorithm, hard drive size, CPU type, how many GHz the memory bandwidth. They ask for the data and they are going to receive it or a very convincing explanation. That was established way before computers were invented. And if you care about this aspect you are free to campaign against it. It's ONLY between you and the law. Google, the investigator, the judge, the postal service and all the others just comply.
Right. This is precisely what I have read.
Pardon my thickness. How?
Sure. Also the pope should stay away from gay people since the year 300. Rich people should help as many poor as they can. One should rise in the bus and give the seat to an old gentleman or lady. But we live in a far from ideal world. That to play your game.
Otherwise Google does that already. It's safe. Because then can send you an SMS to recover your free account at their expense. They ask the security question each time you log in from a different location. And so on. They are privacy aware as they don't share your emails with your inquisitive mother. Something you can't say of the postal service or a chatty general practitioner. And given the evil janitor or the evil admin steal the hard drive with your mail they won't be able to read it.
Sure, you can idealise it to the extreme. But in real life and real world that is already enough for a free / cheap service.
You too should be more concerned with the employer, school, relatives or neighbours than with NSA. Please do notice than I am not saying it's a good thing what NSA does. Only that it is a distant threat. One as concerned as you are already does have a personal mail server somewhere. One should give thanks to someone like RMS for the ability to have that at the cost of the hardware components plus the power bill.
They don't lie. They don't deceive. Not in this case. The problem is elsewhere. Think about it a couple of minutes.
Guess that spells «time to give it up» for me.

I feel you were being sarcastic. But it's not the case. Removing those help pages won't alienate their clients. It's truly a way to be nice. Also, although dropping SMTP and IMAP4 support and replacing them with some exotic closed protocol won't do a thing. Android update and the web interface would do the trick. It's even worse. When Yahoo has dropped POP3 support, without replacing it with anything, some Sourceforge projects were started just to replace that. So, again, it's truly a nice gesture. Maybe, only maybe, it helped them initially to gather up strenght. Today that means zero.
Yes. I heard of it. Thank you for including the wikipedia page. Have you read it?
 >> OpenSSL 1.0.1 or greater introduces NPN.
 >> The browsers Google Chrome/Chromium, Firefox (version 11+, enabled by default since 13) and Opera browser (version 12.10+) support SPDY.
 >> Amazon's Silk browser for the Kindle Fire uses the SPDY protocol to communicate with their EC2 service for Web page rendering.
An open standard with quite large support from the open source community. Meaning many more can follow.
So what's the point?
I dislike slashdot. It's almost all noise. And one of the sites blocking Tor. But I was interested in your argument so I went there for the second time today. And there I read:
 >> Note that no end date has been set for Talk
So, again, what is your point?
The pope preaches. Google sells. If I use Google search words start popping up suggesting me what I might ask. If I have gmail there is advertising related to the CONTENTS of my received emails. If I go around youtube I get a full column on the right hand side with suggestions. And you know what is impressive? They are all about right. And I surely have missed the time where someone officialy from Google went out and said «we're going to cripple all that for your privacy». Quite the opposite. They said it's one of the reasons people use Google instead of the competition.
I personally like how you dramatise things. Yet, they were never small. Google has not started with Woz in a garage and it wasn't selling sports shoes out of a trunk. They had money. They had computing power. They had storage. Just because they have expanded over they years, does not mean they started as a image board on a Pentium hold behind a highschooler's You might have a case with the patents. But that is all.
Actually the open standards, although good by being open, they are crap. Email is ugly and squirts information all along the path even if you do bother to encrypt everything. HTTP is chatty to the extreme. And so on. XMPP is nicer than OSCAR and PNG is better than GIF. That statement does not make telnet safer.
 From the kernel source.

Cute. Last time I have checked spam meant unsolicited mail, nothing about providing ways to unsubscribe. Would that make a spammer who keeps sending me offers because their system keeps reharvesting my address ok as long as give me a way to unsubscribe each time? I know it's not the case of Avaaz, but still.
Yet, you have avoided once more the question. I'll requote it:
 >> By introducing policies that are disruptive to legitimate activities.
 >> Why they are disruptive? Because GMail is being used by a huge part
 >> of e-mail users.
 > What do you mean by «legitimate»? And second what do you mean by
 > «legitimate activities»?
Or is it just a figgure of speech? You write over and over again «us» although you are one person (I think). You generalise «policies that are disruptive to legitimate activities» and yet you only meant Avaaz. What's this?
Jabber is a server. Google has never supported Jabber as far as I know. Do you know anything against it?
Net Neutrality is accepted by Google. They are against it. And lobby against it. And it's their right. I have searched their help pages and they never say anything like «we fight for Net Neutrality». And you know why I believe this is not an issue? Christians say Thou shall not kill, yet many christian countries have the capital punishment. Islam supporters come forward and say islam is a religion of peace even after all those bloody attacks. Buddhists and hindus are about don't do harm as you will have a crappy future life and still they kill other people.
Yet people like you keep going after Google, implying they are somehow evil. And most of them, at least the ones I know, they do enjoy at least few of the things Google provides for free and on a daily basis. Am I wrong to call it hypocrisy?
That quote, like the also often used «freedom of speech» argument, was meant for the state. Not for people or companies. It might sound nice, that does not make it true. Neither makes it binding.
I am sure they are well aware of the effects. And that they ponder it well before jumping with a new service. As long as it brings Google closer to 100% of the online advertising business it's good. As long as it brings Google closer to 100% of the portable devices business it's good. And so on for each and every market they're in as well as markets they are going to start conquering after this wonderful August 2013.
That's all cheap propaganda. It's wrong on so many levels.
Do you have multiple personalities?
Probably you are not aware of this. But your discourse contains more crap than anything I have read as coming from Google or one of its owners. «we» is a way to implicate the guillable. If you had any decency you would have limited that «we» to anything more precise. Paranoid people. People who need protection from their own states. People who hear voices. People living in the Northen Hemisphere. Me and my partner. People who can't afford $5 a year for a mail account. Anything but we.
Sure. These days I was checking the laptop market for somebody. Guess what! Most laptops, at least the cheap ones do not have a LED for hard drive activity. So the user is left in the dark about hard drive activity. Most laptops do not have the flickering leds for WiFi. Many laptops don't have flickering leds for the Ethernet port, and some have it, but you have to turn the laptop in a weird position to notice them. Some don't have a LED to signal if the webcam is on or off, and some can turn that led off in software. I have yet to see a laptop that has the microphone with an associated LED to show it's status on / off. No switch, Ethernet or otherwise, signals it might be under surveilance. And the list can go on for a few pages. And I am sorry, but I do not recall any hysteric person making a fuss about any of the above issues.
I'm sorry too. It's the second time this day you are pointing that out so I'll be quiet afterwards.
Poland is to Europe what Pakistan is to the Orient.
Now one might argue that Catholics are a few centuries ahead of Islam. But the point was that being in Poland for an extended period makes one feel anal sex far more offensive than a civilised country like Denmark or The Netherlands, even if there are only a few kilometers away (that is a figgure of speech).
I never even even imply anything remote like «all poles». I happen to know quite a few Russians living there. Ukrainians too. The Jews have had a very difficult life in the past century, but there are still a few. And I can assure a Jew living in Posen has a better chance to be prejudiced against gay people than a Jew living in New York.
And that can be a good argument: myself I believe that developing critical thinking to fight 1000 year old or older beliefs can help with the need for freedom and privacy. Yet things like denying medical care because it might lead to an abortion are far worse than Google policy. I'm not saying PRISM is a good thing. I'm saying only that there are far worse things which get ignored.
Yes. It might be have something to do with Input/Output so it might be a key logger. Or worse: it can lead to IOerr, famous hacker who happens to be of jewish descent and the Sionists have an agenda of World domination just as exposed in revealing show Pinky and the Brain. Sorry. Couldn't help myself. This whole paragraph is a joke.
The answer according to me: there can't be set a reliable limit. Thus there should be no limit. Either you leave the things the way they are or you start working towards forbiding by the law.
Than there should be no problem getting their message some other way than email.
You mean it's not for profit.
Than what's the fuss with the grave danger? Why does this thread exist?
Online petitions. Meaning spam.
I recall another initiative like that: feeding African children by clicking banners. Each click meant one piece of rice. I've read the creator is stinking rich because of that.
It seems that I am helping the cause of that corporation. Sorry, I'm

Yea, but aren't they impossible for that type of typical email user?
Aliases for every company? Most providers don't offer aliases. Or they do it Yahoo style with one or two options. + addressing it's also badly supported. Thus the primary address is the only one. Having a whole subdomain is not available from the major services, not if it's an  address. And it's not foolproof as I started noticing spam for generated addresses (say RandomString
How could one find out the spammy services other than by experience. This is precisely how I found out about linked in. And that's just because there's no other way to reach that data. And bugmenot was crippled before taking off.
DNSBL? I don't have a plugin for that in Thunderbird. And I can control what the provider does. Sure, most go for spamassassin as it leads to less false positives than a bayesian filter, but there's nothing the user can do.
In the end, what one can do to teach people of «e-mail hygiene» and «spam fighting»?

Cute. Last time I have checked spam meant unsolicited mail, nothing about providing ways to unsubscribe. Would that make a spammer who keeps sending me offers because their system keeps reharvesting my address ok as long as give me a way to unsubscribe each time? I know it's not the case of Avaaz, but still.
Yet, you have avoided once more the question. I'll requote it:
 >> By introducing policies that are disruptive to legitimate activities.
 >> Why they are disruptive? Because GMail is being used by a huge part
 >> of e-mail users.
 > What do you mean by «legitimate»? And second what do you mean by
 > «legitimate activities»?
Or is it just a figgure of speech? You write over and over again «us» although you are one person (I think). You generalise «policies that are disruptive to legitimate activities» and yet you only meant Avaaz. What's this?
Jabber is a server. Google has never supported Jabber as far as I know. Do you know anything against it?
Net Neutrality is accepted by Google. They are against it. And lobby against it. And it's their right. I have searched their help pages and they never say anything like «we fight for Net Neutrality». And you know why I believe this is not an issue? Christians say Thou shall not kill, yet many christian countries have the capital punishment. Islam supporters come forward and say islam is a religion of peace even after all those bloody attacks. Buddhists and hindus are about don't do harm as you will have a crappy future life and still they kill other people.
Yet people like you keep going after Google, implying they are somehow evil. And most of them, at least the ones I know, they do enjoy at least few of the things Google provides for free and on a daily basis. Am I wrong to call it hypocrisy?
That quote, like the also often used «freedom of speech» argument, was meant for the state. Not for people or companies. It might sound nice, that does not make it true. Neither makes it binding.
I am sure they are well aware of the effects. And that they ponder it well before jumping with a new service. As long as it brings Google closer to 100% of the online advertising business it's good. As long as it brings Google closer to 100% of the portable devices business it's good. And so on for each and every market they're in as well as markets they are going to start conquering after this wonderful August 2013.
That's all cheap propaganda. It's wrong on so many levels.
Do you have multiple personalities?
Probably you are not aware of this. But your discourse contains more crap than anything I have read as coming from Google or one of its owners. «we» is a way to implicate the guillable. If you had any decency you would have limited that «we» to anything more precise. Paranoid people. People who need protection from their own states. People who hear voices. People living in the Northen Hemisphere. Me and my partner. People who can't afford $5 a year for a mail account. Anything but we.
Sure. These days I was checking the laptop market for somebody. Guess what! Most laptops, at least the cheap ones do not have a LED for hard drive activity. So the user is left in the dark about hard drive activity. Most laptops do not have the flickering leds for WiFi. Many laptops don't have flickering leds for the Ethernet port, and some have it, but you have to turn the laptop in a weird position to notice them. Some don't have a LED to signal if the webcam is on or off, and some can turn that led off in software. I have yet to see a laptop that has the microphone with an associated LED to show it's status on / off. No switch, Ethernet or otherwise, signals it might be under surveilance. And the list can go on for a few pages. And I am sorry, but I do not recall any hysteric person making a fuss about any of the above issues.
I'm sorry too. It's the second time this day you are pointing that out so I'll be quiet afterwards.
Poland is to Europe what Pakistan is to the Orient.
Now one might argue that Catholics are a few centuries ahead of Islam. But the point was that being in Poland for an extended period makes one feel anal sex far more offensive than a civilised country like Denmark or The Netherlands, even if there are only a few kilometers away (that is a figgure of speech).
I never even even imply anything remote like «all poles». I happen to know quite a few Russians living there. Ukrainians too. The Jews have had a very difficult life in the past century, but there are still a few. And I can assure a Jew living in Posen has a better chance to be prejudiced against gay people than a Jew living in New York.
And that can be a good argument: myself I believe that developing critical thinking to fight 1000 year old or older beliefs can help with the need for freedom and privacy. Yet things like denying medical care because it might lead to an abortion are far worse than Google policy. I'm not saying PRISM is a good thing. I'm saying only that there are far worse things which get ignored.
Yes. It might be have something to do with Input/Output so it might be a key logger. Or worse: it can lead to IOerr, famous hacker who happens to be of jewish descent and the Sionists have an agenda of World domination just as exposed in revealing show Pinky and the Brain. Sorry. Couldn't help myself. This whole paragraph is a joke.
The answer according to me: there can't be set a reliable limit. Thus there should be no limit. Either you leave the things the way they are or you start working towards forbiding by the law.
Than there should be no problem getting their message some other way than email.
You mean it's not for profit.
Than what's the fuss with the grave danger? Why does this thread exist?

What do you mean by «legitimate»? And second what do you mean by
«legitimate activities»?
My bad. For me English is a second language. But «fucks us in the arse»
implies a deliberate act. I see your domain is from Poland, which is
quite a backward country when it comes to anything people do, yet a pope
disaproves. Meaning anal sex, heterosexual, homosexual or plain
masturbation is a very very bad thing to do. I might be wrong, but in
this context «GMail fucks us in the arse» implies at least malice. Yet
now you write «I am not assuming malice on Google's part». Help me
How can anybody draw the line? It's fine as long as they are under an
arbitrary value set by WHOM, but it's wrong after that?
Than they should break Avaaz.
If one company depends so much on another, than you can call the first
one a parasyte. If it's existence depends on Google, than they should
ask nicely and maybe forward a nice sum of money. Or they have quite
some nerve to try to impose rules from the position of parasyte.
Hopefuly for you their niche might be filled afterwards by a company
that can stand on its own.
Don't you think that is for the people to decide?
Because they way you expressed it, as I have no idea what Avaaz is or
does, they are a puny corporation living from Google's leftovers. Meaning Google does a good thing for their users.

A figure of speech meaning what than? Shouldn't communication make thing This list is a rather active one. It's in English so it's fair to assume even if they are not Americans, a good part of the subscribed members are from the States. As many people in the States live in New York, one might go ahead and ask for a good pizza place or for the average rent for one room appartments. Weird. I don't think that is appropiate. But I will not continue on this thread.

I have to admit I haven't even noticed what Google service was involved. Still, what's «bad» about it?
But do they have the legal right not to hold those keys? Or this matter is irrelevant to you?
But that's not what they are saying.
Isn't it ironic? So Google SHOULD make things easier for you to tell people to use other services? Sounds like the new anti–gay legislation in Russia: making it easier for priests to preach homofobia.

Yet they not only support SMTP and IMAP4, but they give instructions on how to set up Mozilla Thunderbird. They use XMPP and they allow connections from outside their network. In most ways they are way ahead of the competition. To me it sounds pretty much like the GNU/Linux kernel development: make your project popular enough and conform to our coding structure and we're going to include it in the main tree. Fail to do so and you are free to develop patches and loadable modules.

I realised that my last few hours were in defence of Google. I'm not. I'm just against the vocal minority forcing some third party to do something just because it feels right to that minority. So the talk is one based on principle.
I used to have a Gmail account, a separate Youtube account and yet another for Picasa. They are all gone. And I can say it was qick and clean. Something I can't say even for sites perceived as good such as Ubuntu Forums.
But most webmail providers give some options. Such as do not make spam out of addresses that are in Contacts. Even those who don't offer this option explicitly, make malware links available far easier for people that I have in Contacts. One can also make sorting rules. A mail failing this most probably is spam. Even if the receiver doesn't feel that.
Now that is something quite different. Do you feel it's about the same? How come?
Yes. Of course.
You see, I might be very upset with the contract I am given to sign by the power company. They [the company] say clauses are non negotiable, even if I feel they [the clauses] are abusive. My alternatives are to move in a different country or use solar panels and light the room with candles. Although very romantic in this eco concept, that might turn very expensive. So I feel having access to power is very important. And I am left with filing with the consumer protection agencies hoping enough people are bothered by those clauses.
On the other hand I can use Google or I can search a provider in India. I can use Vmail.me which is in France even if the name says Montenegro, and I can try Riseup which swear they won't give data, although the law specified they have to obey. And I do. I have accounts with all of them. In other words people stay with gmail because they like the server and don't care about what has been written in every newspaper in the so called Western world. It's not for me to decide for them, or I'd become some sort of Stalin. Today I rule what Google should do, tomorrow I am going to tell you what you should do.
I didn't know that. Thank you for the information.
And yes, to me it sounds like a good idea what Google is said to be doing. Although I have my doubts Google targets anyone in particular. Finding a good site, reading about a good cause and getting involved seems like the thing to do. Bleeding people out of microsums that seem harmless on a huge scale usually helps the few full time employees and little more.

Ok. I think I get the point.
My question was if they can, given the US law, do such a thing. You have repeated the previous statements.
I offer encryption means precisely «I offer encryption». If there is a full stop after that, than the rest is fantasy.
Take for example the fact that I do full disk encryption. I have the key somewhere. Now. Someone who has the key and the hard drive has access just like without full disk encryption. Including files that I have deleted through the regular delete and not some secure method. This does not make my hard drive any less encrypted than it is.
Now take another example: food containing dead pig meat sold in an islamic country as chicken or just «meat». In the first case it's a lie, it might as well write «no meat at all». In the second is a lie by omission.
Do not confuse the two cases. Google never ever stated the rest. It's just your imagination.
Have they said «we protect your data from the government»? I am sure to have missed that one. Same goes for the other scenarios mentioned.
You are strange.
They do not have to. Most important providers are bugged BEFORE the data reaches their servers. So it's first the Men in Black. Than is the server. Than is my computer.
On the other hand you have the power of law. Once there is a data storage one can ask a judge to write a special kind of legal letter to which the storage manager HAS to comply. So the whole chain starting with the investigator and ending with the judge couldn't care less about key, algorithm, hard drive size, CPU type, how many GHz the memory bandwidth. They ask for the data and they are going to receive it or a very convincing explanation. That was established way before computers were invented. And if you care about this aspect you are free to campaign against it. It's ONLY between you and the law. Google, the investigator, the judge, the postal service and all the others just comply.
Right. This is precisely what I have read.
Pardon my thickness. How?
Sure. Also the pope should stay away from gay people since the year 300. Rich people should help as many poor as they can. One should rise in the bus and give the seat to an old gentleman or lady. But we live in a far from ideal world. That to play your game.
Otherwise Google does that already. It's safe. Because then can send you an SMS to recover your free account at their expense. They ask the security question each time you log in from a different location. And so on. They are privacy aware as they don't share your emails with your inquisitive mother. Something you can't say of the postal service or a chatty general practitioner. And given the evil janitor or the evil admin steal the hard drive with your mail they won't be able to read it.
Sure, you can idealise it to the extreme. But in real life and real world that is already enough for a free / cheap service.
You too should be more concerned with the employer, school, relatives or neighbours than with NSA. Please do notice than I am not saying it's a good thing what NSA does. Only that it is a distant threat. One as concerned as you are already does have a personal mail server somewhere. One should give thanks to someone like RMS for the ability to have that at the cost of the hardware components plus the power bill.
