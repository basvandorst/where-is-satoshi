Could you explain the bit about having leadership w/o hierarchy.  Yes ,if there is an informal leadership such as what Tim was refering to, then their is no heirarchy.  However, as soon as people get designated as 'leaders' or 'moderators' then one has to have heirechy in that no matter how the various pieces of a system are arranged, they have to be arranged somehow, even completely at random.
imho (which you seem to have so many of) you could spare the pseudo-Zen BS.
I don't think he was suggesting this in the least, he is quite capable of defending himself.  I don't particularly like the idea of someone that I had no part in choosing being seen as representative of my views.
Key word 'so-called'  An anarchie is usually a conceptual ideal that is never reached, sorta like a democracy.
Dosen't it though?  How else can one 'lead'.  Even if just by setting an example the leader is changing the follower's actions, e.g. controlling.  Granted the follower is volentarily submitting to this control, but it is control none the less.  Most other cases of hard leadership are not as nice.
