@_subject: Mixmaster Security Issues 
There is no way in which the security of Mixmaster messages is LESS than
that of type I (cypherpunk) remailers. Yes, each remailer is limited to knowing the previous and next
destinations. A Mixmaster remailer can only tell if it is first, last, or somewhere in
the middle. No information is leaked about position in the chain. There is
a hard limit of 20 hops. Version 1.0 (which was released but not widely used or promoted) used
PGPTools by Pr0duct Cypher. This is a library which provides hooks for most
of the major PGP routines. The main problem with PGPTools is that I could
not get it to compile on anything but a SUN. The other problem was that it
was difficult to control the encryption so I could avoid any change in the
size of information when it was encrypted. RSAREF is very portable, robust,
supported, easy to work with, and was easy to use for fine control of the
encryption process. RSAREF is also much less of a black box to me. I can
understand what it is doing in detail. Because of the message size limitations there are some advantages to
sending the mixmaster chain through some type 1 remailers first, rather
than sending a type 1 message in a Mixmaster packet.
It is very difficult to know what fraction of the traffic I see is cover. I
generate some cover traffic my self, and I know some others do as well.
Right now a reordering pool of 5 messages results in a latency of about 30
min. Mixmaster is no longer a small fraction of the remailer market. A
majority of all public remailers support Mixmaster. This is not quite correct, at each hop your message could have gone to any
remailer at all. There are now 16 Mixmaster remailers in operation. If you
have two good remailers in your chain (not run by the enemy), then a given
message into the system is probably one of the messages that emerges
between 10 Min and several hours later (with some complex probability
distribution over that time). Note that because of the way the reordering
is done, messages could stay in the pool forever, but this is exponentially
less likely with time.
It turns out that this is good security for one message, but is much less
secure if you continue to communicate with the same person for some time.
Then the attacker can look for correlations between your sending a message,
and everyone who receives them. After several messages in one month, you
will stand out, unless you send cover messages regularly, so you correlate
with everyone all the time (destroying any information about who you
actually correspond with).         -Lance

You don't need anything this fancy. Just have Mixmaster dump the message to
a file rather than sending it (-o option). Then make that the message you
send through the type 1 chain, and make the first Mixmaster remailer the
final destination of the type 1 chain.

@_subject: Anonymity: A Modest Proposal 
If you simply do not want to be a final hop, it is trivial to distinguish
final hops from intermediate hops in the chain. With cypherpunk remailers
you can scan for the remailer headers. With Mixmaster there is a completely
different format to the encrypted header (inside the encryption) for final
hops as opposed to intermediate hops.
I think one solution to this problem is to encourage (require) the use of
pseudonym servers. Having a server like alpha as the entity on the from
line has several advantages.
1) Less Spam since it takes some effort to set up the nym and it will be taken
away as soon as the spam starts.
2) The operator can take firm action. When people complain they want you to
punish the abuser. Typically they want you to pull the offenders account.
With a remailer there is no account to pull, but with a nym server it is
easy to kill the account, making the complainer happy.
3) The nym server could have a policy of only accepting messages encrypted
to it, and logging the address the message came from. If confronted, the
nym server could point to the last remailer in the chain. But that remailer
could not have known the contents of the message since it was encrypted to
the nym server.
If all nym servers were standardized to run from the same account name
(nymserve for example) the remailers could be configured to only deliver
final hops to addresses with that username.

They could also end up getting dumped in a message pool. Perhaps all (or most)
nym servers could operate mailing list message pools. Anyone could
subscribe to the pool, and any nym could have its mail directed to that
pool. It should not be too difficult to rig a procmail script to try to
decrypt all mail from that list, and deliver those that could be decrypted.

One need not automate the process of setting up anonymous accounts. One
might also require some sort of exchange before activating the nym to
verify that the return address is working.
I agree. With both free and for-fee nym servers must clearly spell out what
actions will result in the termination of the nym. Perhaps 1 spam, 1
systematic harassment, or more than 5 serious complaints per month. Obvious
this would need to be tuned to preserve free speech while allowing abusers
to be quickly squelched. I would imagine an ecology of these servers would
develop with some short lived permissive servers mixed with long lived more
restrictive ones.

I think the idea of a token has come up before. I think it is a good idea.

than 3 months). Right now there is not much spare room in the Mixmaster
There are several ideas for improvements in Mixmaster that will require the
adoption of an incompatible message format. I plan to collect them and
implement them all at once. One of the ideas is an expiration date in the
message to keep it from ever being replayed (even after the remailer

I think that I am not being clear enough about what I want to do.
Back when I started running remailers, I was using a machine with no local
news software at all. Rather than compile a bunch of software just to allow
the "Anon-Post-To:" command to work, I hacked the scripts to automatically
send those messages to a mail2news gateway. Mixmaster now has a similar built
in anonymous posting ability. If you have inews on your machine, then Mixmaster
can build the "Newsgroups:" header and send the message to inews.
But what if you are running Mixmaster and you don't have inews but you want
to support posting? The answer is to have Mixmaster put together a message
to send to a mail2news gateway for it to post.
When I look at the currently available public mail2news gateways, I see that
two standards already exist. The first is the group.name at gateway.
The other is mail2news at gateway with a "Newsgroups:" header.
It is easy for me to have mixmaster take the request for anonymous posting,
and build the appropriate message for whichever kind of gateway I want to use.
I only want to support one of them. The question is, which one should I
support? Which are there more of. Which are there likely to be more of in the

Permission is granted to distribute this document in any media for any
purpose as long as the entire document is distributed with the attached
digital signature intact, or the document is clearly marked as having been
modified with the locations of deleted text indicated.
Several rumors have surfaced following my announcement of Mixmaster's
changing status. I want to nip these worries in the bud. After discussion
with the party interested in commercially licensing Mixmaster we have
decided to explain the whole situation publicly.
The company offering to license Mixmaster is Phoenix DataNet, a Houston
area ISP. John Perry, a person well known to this list and the remailer
community in general, is a Senior Systems Administrator at Phoenix.
On Thursday I received a call from John. Some others at Phoenix had just
noticed a Mixmaster remailer he had been running on one of their machines.
Phoenix has several large corporate customers who need secure transactions
for some special applications. The core engine of Mixmaster is well suited
to that purpose. They offered to license the code from me to use as the
framework on which to build these other programs. In the process they will
rewrite many basic functions in Mixmaster that need major overhaul (e.g.,
key management). We will incorporate those improvements back into
Mixmaster. This should lead to porting Mixmaster to several other
platforms, and to fixing most of my worst coding atrocities.
I had never considered licensing Mixmaster, but I know John Perry both
personally and by reputation. He has thoroughly assuaged my fears that
Phoenix would try to weaken or restrict Mixmaster in any way. John will be
leading this project on the Phoenix end. He asked that I delay the release
of the next version of Mixmaster pending clarification of every one's
intentions. Now that we have reached an understanding the planned release
of Mixmaster version 2.0.2 will take place as soon as I can get it ready.
There are no plans to sell Mixmaster clients or servers. They will
to be released free with source code. I will still control the contents of
all releases of Mixmaster. All future versions of Mixmaster will be
backward compatible. There will be no "Legal Kludges" preventing old
clients from working with new remailers, and new clients will be able to
generate old message formats.  Currently there are no plans to change the
message format at all.       -Lance Cottrell

@_subject: Mixmaster message formats 
I know Raph already answered this, but I want to toss my few cents in.
It is important to understand the threat model of Mixmaster. I assumed that
all links and some remailers would be compromised. My goal was to ensure
that no information about the message was revealed except to the first and
last remailers in the chain. To borrow from physics (black hole)
terminology, the message must have no hair.
Any active padding by the remailer implies that it knows an upper limit on
the size of the actual message. If each remailer removes some information,
which must be replaced, then conspiring remailers can obtain information
about the where messages are going, by comparing size, and knowing that the
"kernel" of the message can only shrink.
This last statement is true unless remailers add extra hops, which they
encrypt. The reason this is not effective has been thoroughly discussed on
this list.

The second paragraph of this post seems to address a different issue than
the first. The problem of correlations between a certain sender sending and
a certain receiver receiving, is well known and understood. The best
defense against this (as a sender) is to send messages into the remailer
network with a period equal to or less than the the time required for a
message with your typical chain length to pass through the remailer net. If
these are sent at random intervals, then your real mail will blend with the
cover traffic, and mail from you will correlate with all message receipts
by all message recipients.
The second paragraph seems to deal with the issue of being known as an
anonymous remailer or regular remailer user. I am not sure exactly what the
concern with that is.

@_subject: Multiple Remailers at a site? 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I don't think I am following you. My messages are a constant size signal (I
send N messages through the remailer). More traffic increases the
background signal and background noise. While the signal to noise of the
background gets better, the actual amount of noise went up so the ratio of
MY signal to the background noise went down. Perhaps I don't understand
what you are saying.
I think multiple remailers on a machine are less effective than a single
remailer with the combined traffic of all the individual remailers, because
the combined remailer does better reordering from a larger pool.
If the remailer chain contains just two or more uncompromised hops (not
necessarily consecutive) I suspect an attacker will be forced to treat the
remailer bramble as a single object. This attack is based on time
correlations of messages sent and received. In this case background traffic
is good because of the large number of false correlations it generates.
However, it is stunning how few messages it takes to make the correlation
stand out. The defense against this attack is to ensure that you send and
receive enough remailer mail to correlate with all other users for all
messages. Producing cover traffic, some of which returns to you, and some
of which is bit bucketed also ensures that it will not be known when you
receive a real message (as opposed to one of your own). Obviously this is
best done when you are a remailer operator yourself.

I expect the majority of our anonymous account to be telnet. We are setting up the contract to make it clear that any contract signed with a minor is invalid, and that any access of our system by that individual is actually illegal (various statutes on misuse of computer resources are I don't know about posting the agreement. My lawyer may not want to see all his hard work in the public domain. I will ask.

I think the "enemy controled remailer" is an important part of the threat model. In many ways it is easier to do than to monitor all the traffic.
True, but it is folly to think that only one remailer would be compromised.
There has been a lot of discussion of this. It is difficult to make slugs which can be purchased in bulk (since you want to buy them using anonymous mail), can not be used to connect messages from a one person, and do not infringe on Chaum's patents. It is not acceptable for a remailer to see a message and know which other messages came from that same person. If it is ever the first remailer, it knows who you are. If it is the last, it knows who you mailed to. There has been discussion of secondary markets for the slugs, but I don't think it is going to happen.
Oops, I must have hit the wrong key. I ment to have a copy go to the list.

There was a lot of analysis like this back in the 1990's on this list. You could probably look for it in the archives.
In general, store and forward anonymity services, like Mixmaster, have much better anonymity characteristics than real time systems like TOR, basically for the reasons you outline.

@_subject: Encrypted mailing lists? 
I think there is probably more value in signed mailing lists than encrypted.
If it is encrypted, and the process is anything less than absolutely seamless and transparent, it is likely to drive away a large fraction of the readers.
I hardly have time to read or respond to the messages as it is. Add even a few second per message and I would drop out.

I think we need to look first at the threat model you are trying to address. Is the concern that the photo's creator would fake the location of the photo?
Is it that you want to make the location of the photo self-verifying if it is re-used?
Do you want to simply be able to spot re-use and prove where the photo was actually taken?
Something else?
I think that a clearer definition of the problem will help identify the most appropriate solutions.

@_subject: Metadata anonymization through time delayed email messaging. 
This is a really subtle issue. Much has been written about how to optimize mixing pools. 6-12 hours is a really long delay for many purposes. If not everyone is doing so, long delay messages might turn out to be of particular interest.
It also seems like a bad idea to put the message holding function at the sender's end. That makes it easier to try to identify who might have been storing messages for later delivery.
This might be a very simple and interesting service to provide at the end of remailer chains. Exit remailers might have an additional command which would instruct them to hold the message for a given period or until a given time before final delivery.
With Mixmaster I spent a lot of time thinking about message size. If you can recognize a message from its size as it enters and leaves a node, then all the delay and mixing is effectively thwarted.

OK, so we have some video. If that video was taken from within an app on a mobile device, it may be somewhat tamper resistant.
Some external cameras have GPS, but certainly not all, and any meta-data could be changed before importing.
In terms of location, we have device GPS, cell tower location, nearby WiFi based location, IP address, Internet network topology and timing. Any of those could be spoofed with some effort. Signing content with location information before uploading might bring reputation into the equation, and give some more trust in the information.
I assume your binning concept (100,000 or 2^32) is to give "I was there" without saying "here is exactly how to find and kill me". Is that correct? We might achieve the same by simply rounding Lat Long at some level of granularity.
We could lock down the time of publication to the system using hash chain type structures. The hash, location, time, and document could all be signed by the hashing server. This could be distributed and redundant.
Just some quick thoughts. Lance Cottrell
