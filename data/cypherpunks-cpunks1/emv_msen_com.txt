For you all.  Interesting because it would appear to be a real live
marketplace, with real live money, tho no crypto per se in there.

  Greetings,
  this is an  item from corryfee. Apologies to those who have
  already seen it. I thought it was sufficiently interesting
  to pass it on.   BTW, the some of the results of the Santa Fe experiment, to which
  the text refers, will be published in a forthcomming book by   John Rust and Dan Friedman "Double Auction Markets: Theory, Institutions,
  Evidence". Publisher is Addison-Wesley (Santa Fe Institute series
  On Studies in the Science of Complexity).
  Cheers,
