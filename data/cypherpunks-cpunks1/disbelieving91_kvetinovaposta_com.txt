mostly i just stinking LOVE knitting. you sit at the counter
and it's so yummy
i love her style. i found that amazing old shirt (we're big fans) at the thrift store for $1 and it's so soft. have a happy st. patrick's day. it was super delicious. and totally not what you are supposed to be eating
i have always dreamed of going to ireland, (and scotland too- mccaleb), to research our family history, and to see the green grass in real life.
ps- did i say i would sew this past saturday? i meant next saturday! haha!
this image of silke stoddard's knitting is burned into my mind and tatooed on my heart. i am looking forward to a date with grant.
my homekeeping secrets
i love the color palette and obvious softness. she's amazing. doesn't she look like lucy from chronicles of narnia? and the fact that she's 31 makes me happy to be 31.
i always enjoy knitting lacy stuff but this pattern was especially fun, super easy, and portable.
haha, that's my girl. i told cate about st. patrick's day and ireland- she has a lot of irish ancestors through me.
