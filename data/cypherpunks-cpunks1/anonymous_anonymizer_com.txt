@_subject: I Love Tim May 
Tim - I've been off the list for a long time but return to find that I actually agree with a bunch of your posts.  What the fuck happened?  Aimee you have done wonders for love.
Feds here put my bits into the vacuumed up collection of the day for later style and word adjacency analysis and detect the level of threat and stress in my writing, correlate it with other postings to determine the level of sympathy with listcrime freedom mongers and tag it with the unique ID of my processor put it in a vault for seven years.
Meanwhile overhead drone aircraft videotape my town, then downtown they perform automated object trajectory analysis which spits out the outliers of Bayesian determiners of normalcy, flagging them as possible threatening activities while identifying the gait, odors, and timesequence behaviors of individuals who thought or did something not sanctioned by the Corporate Masters.
So my Big Brethren, hey - I'm thinking of just how one might devastate a regional economy with just a minor disruption in its transportation capabilities.  I don't wear Nike Shoes. So sue me. Arrest me. Fuck me.
Some day some time Tim May may have writ:
"There seems to be a feeding frenzy of these "you're going to get in trouble!" posts.
Several weeks ago, it was the "spoliation" thread, with Aimee assuring us that using certain technologies must be illegal. She could say why, in real terms (real as opposed to "maybe in the future"), but she implied we would be on thin ice. Oddly, Black Unicorn added a blizzard of cites he claimed showed that using some technologies, even long in advance of a any charges being filed or orders issued, would be "taunting Happy Fun Court." Apparently the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments are made moot when Mr. Happy Fun Court decides he is ..."

@_subject: oppose nomination of John Ashcroft 
Hmmmm... "Ashcroft has been hailed as an ally by the NRA, voting against
trigger locks and the assault weapons ban while supporting conceal and carry
laws and gun show loopholes to regulation."
Might I second that, in this case.  Gee, maybe this website should be named
; I was feeling kinda lukewarm about his
nomination until I saw it.  Thanks, sparky!
"In 1999, Ashcroft recorded radio ads urging Missouri voters to support an
NRA-sponsored ballot initiative that would have allowed almost anyone -
including convicted child molesters and stalkers - to carry concealed guns
in Missouri."
Maybe I should move to Missouri.  I've always wanted to shoot a
child molester.

@_subject: ex-PSIA-noda 
I am Hironari Noda, an ex-PSIA official. As I reported to you last November, on September 23, Tokyo metropolitan police arrested me on charge of striking a PSIA agent on the head. Until the incident, PSIA had kept me under surveillance for several days and stationed an official vehicle just in front of my apartment house on the morning of the accident.
Although I did not hit him, I was arrested and forced to be detained in the Nogata Police Station for total 18 days. Eventually I was released on October 10. Even the Tokyo Prosecutors' Office could not help deciding that they gave up prosecuting me. That was because there was no proof except for unreliable witnesses by PSIA agents themselves. The "injured" man was not able to submit even a piece of medical certificates.  Then, in return, I finally decided to bring two lawsuits against the Japanese and the Tokyo local governments, based on the National Compensation Law and submitted two written complaints to the Tokyo Local Court on December 28, 2000.
The purpose of one of the lawsuits is to blame for the illegal investigation and fabrication by PSIA and that of the other to accuse the inadequate judgment and law procedure by Tokyo Metropolitan Police, Tokyo Prosecutors' Office and so on.
The courts have already been held since February 13, 2001. The governments try to delay the judgment process. As a result, the next court will not be held until April 13. The foreign correspondent who attended the court was surprised because it finished in ten minutes. Just the exchange of the documents. That was the reality of the Japanese court system. However, at some points during the procedure, the PSIA agents will have to be summoned to the court.
I opened a website on December 14,2000 in order to criticize PSIA, publicize the developments of the lawsuits and make the related legal documents available to all those who are interested in this matter.  Unfortunately, most of the content is written in Japanese but I follow the intelligence related topics in Japan.
On the lower part of the top page, two colored images of the books are attached. The right one is a cover picture of the book titled "PSIA secret documents", which was published on February 5, 2001.
 If you are familiar with Japanese, please check the pages.

not if you ever lived in new york, ate lunch innumerable times in the courtyard below the towers, watched the pink and blue sunrise reflect off them as you took a dawn ferry with your lover, watched the city glisten from a quarter-mile up in the sky, felt your stomach flutter in vertigo at the sheer size of the towers against the clouds standing at the base looking up ...
We are in tears looking at the cracked city.
You were never there, or you have no soul.

         The ghost of Due Process hovers above the funeral pyre where her entire sisterhood burned, drifting between the wafting billows of rancid smoke, and I ask myself: What is to be done?

You all, including Mr. May, missed the subtlety of the point that due process has NOT been suspended in the case of these detainees.
They HAVE representation, and I don't THINK the Bill
of Rights says anywhere that you get to see Mommy
if you're arrested, but that you can obtain
representation, you are not required to incriminate
yourself, and so forth.  In theory.
I just can't bring myself to whine about the detained under the circumstances, when I know
of second-graders who are buried under a literal megaton of rubble.
Should "civil liberties be suspended?"  No.  Should suspects be treated like kindergardners?
Fuck no.

How about we play "let's hypothesize the conditions that make our argument true."  That saves having to ground your reasoning in reality.
The Washington Post article says "and limited access to their lawyers"....
and "The Justice Department has also refused to reveal the names of the lawyers representing them."
At least they have lawyers, don't you get the point?
The dead had no lawyers to argue for thier lives.
"That process is supervised by a court."
The dead had no judge supervising their execution.
Then you don't know what you're arguing, do you?
Pick your battles.
Wiretapping expansion, big problem, Lack of luxury accomodations for material witnesses
who are at the least crucial information resources and
may be co-conspirators, little problem.

It's nice that there's a forum available to you where you are free to assert and assume whatever you wish, without the inconvenience of any They were allowed to speak
How do you know what information was discussed?
You are free to believe whatever you wish.  But that's not a
standard of proof that means anything.
Personal belief, supposition, unsubstantiated assertion.  I'm glad we're not talking about anything like you'd
see in a star chamber or brutal prison regime.  Glad
you exhibit a pristine standard of evidence in
contrast to those you revile.  Hypocrite.

wl p An Metet raged on:
If this is an example of your communication style it's no wonder you've had the shit beat out of you by the cops and I wish them well doing it.  I have been arrested, jailed, lunched with ex State Attorneys, chatted with FBI, bickered with the NSA, watched homicide detectives get a statement from the person who butchered and dismembered my best friend, have an ex-cop relative, had a guy beat almost to death with baseball bats on my front step while the 'pigs' responded code 3 to save his fucking life, lived in warzone ghettos.  Don't tell me about not having any experience with cops.
Your incoherent ranting fails to account for there being good and bad on both sides of the blue line, and frankly I'll take a confrontation with a "pig" over a confrontation with a maniac like you any day.  At least they sort of screen out as many psychopaths as possible.

The test of intelligence is the ability to reconcile contradictory stimulus and make the better decision, dickhead muthafuckah.
Like I said, there's good and bad on both sides of the line.  Most cops will behave a fuck of a lot more responsibly than most people like you.
It doesn't mean I suck up to cops, it just means I deal with them more intelligently than you.

@_subject: FBI wants to have Internet Off-switch 
Reading the article it looks more like the kind of news that's playing a lot these days: the story of 'something is not yet being done', nobody is claiming to be doing it, but it could be done and the majority of people would support it.  A kind of "no news is news" story.
At the same time, if Baker, attorney with Steptoe (god what a perfect name!), were aware of this and leaked it to the press based on work he is doing with the FBI, wouldn't he be subject to imprisonment or at least civil and professional penalties for violation of attorney-client confidentiality?  Unless the FBI wants it leaked.  And why?  To gauge reaction perhaps.  To tell the frogs the heat's going to be turned up a notch?
But it also could be Baker trying to keep warm in the sunshine of publicity by having something to say.  At the same time spouting this information would be a most egregious violation of at least SOMEthing.
"Curiouser and curiouser," said Alice!

Yes, thanks.  I completely neglected to enumerate the possibility
