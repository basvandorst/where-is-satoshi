@_subject: Wacky Weekend: The '.secure' gTLD 
"The proposal comes from Alex Stamos of research firm iSec Partners, and would appoint Artemis Internet as the gatekeeper of .secure. Artemis would require registered domains to encrypt all web and email traffic (except for HTTP redirects funneling connections towards the appropriate TLS-encrypted site), use DNSSEC, and deploy DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) for spam prevention. In addition, Artemis would employ a rigorous screening process to verify registrants' identities (including reviewing articles of incorporation and human interviews), and routinely conduct security scans of registered sites. The venture has $9.6 million (US) in funding provided by Artemis'
parent company NCC Group, a UK-based IT security firm."
  Discuss.  Debate.  Digress.
