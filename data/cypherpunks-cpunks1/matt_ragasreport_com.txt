THIS WEEK'S COMMENTARY=====================================
An Insider's Look at the Next Economy Editor's Note: I hope that everyone had a great 4th of July with their families.  Due to the holiday shortened week, the RagasReport decided to take a short nap this week and enjoy some of the beautiful sunshine here in Florida. Of course, the report will return next Friday with its regular dose of insider commentary and analysis of the tech sector.  In the meantime, I thought I'd share with you some of the great endorsements that my new book - Lessons From the eFront - has recently received.
