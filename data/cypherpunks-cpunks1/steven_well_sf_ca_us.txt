@_subject: getting wired #2 
If it's any comfort I can't get any myself. The issue is
sold out and there are very few even in the WIRED office,
so few that they won't spare 'em.  What's worse, it's
very hard to Xerox the article since it is printed on a
weird background. If you can't get it anywhere, let me
know and I'll try to get one to you, but I would appreciate
it if you (and anyone else) wrote the editors at wired.com
and told 'em you would like to see reprints of the story.

@_subject: on the radio 
I think the name of the show was TechAmerica, or something
like that, a show syndicated on public radio.  I did the interview
about a month ago, me in Amherst, a fairly sharp interviewer in
San Francisco.

@_subject: macworld 
two short comments about the macworld privacy issue
we have a long lead time and the column about digital telephone
(oops, telephony) was in before the clipper stuff broke
and eric, while correct about Mitch Ratcliffe being a fine
reporter who is totally on top of privacy stuff, has the
publication wrong - Mitch is with MacWeek, not Macworld.
Easy to confuse.
