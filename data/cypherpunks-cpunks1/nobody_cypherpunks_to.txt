Shouldn't we turn in our guns first? Or is it our books? Maybe it would be smart to get rid of any compilers, don't you think?
We have a national secret police now that no longer has to start with a crime and then find a criminal, rather they can start with a person and find a way to classify him a criminal. Radio frequencies just give them one more way to put a person in jail for five years. It is actually nice of them to not just suspend habeas corpus universally.

A new book reveals the 22-year effort by FBI director J Edgar Hoover to get Albert Einstein arrested as a political subversive or even a Soviet spy.
Uncovered FBI files are revealed in a book by Fred Jerome who says it was a clash of cultures - Einstein's challenge and change with Hoover's order and obedience.

(possible duplicate message)
What technology is available to create a 2048-bit RSA key pair so that:
1 - the randomness comes from quantum noise
2 - no one knows the secret part,
3 - The secret part is kept in the "box" and it is safe as long as the box is physically secured (expense of securing the box is a don't care).
4 - "box" can do high-speed signing (say, 0.1 mS per signature) over some kind of network interface
5 - you can reasonably convince certain people (that stand to lose a lot and have huge resources) in 1, 2, 3 and 4.
6 - The operation budget is around $1m (maintenance not included).
7 - attacker's budget is around $100m
8 - the key must never be destroyed, so backup is essential.
In other words, convincing translation of a crypto problem into physical security problem.
It looks like the key gets created on the same box(es) on which it is stored, which all interested parties inspected to any desireable level. Once everyone is comfortable the button gets pressed to create/distribute the key, and then you put goons with AKs around the boxes and pray that no one fucked with the microprocessor ... this may mean buying the components at random.

The Nexus is like a mini-OS for the trusted side of the machine.  It acts
as a kernel to manage the "trusted applications", the Nexus Computing
Agents or NCAs.
So what this sentence is really saying is that only one (trusted) OS
will be able to run at a time on a machine.  That's not that surprising
or significant.  Most machines only run one OS at a time.  Sure, with
virtualization and similar techniques you can manage to run more than
one OS at once, but that's unusual.  Probably 99.9% of machines are only
running one OS at a time.
Virtualization is not an option with trusted computing because part of
the point is to be able to offer assurance to remote users about what
the machine will do (i.e. its behavior is predictable, hence trusted).
This implies that it only makes sense to run one trusted OS at a time.
That's probably all the "important" sentence above means.
Right, plus it schedules, loads them, etc, like an OS kernel.  Here is
a simplified form of a diagram they use.  The left hand side is the
legacy mode, with normal Windows applications and OS.  The right hand
side is the new trusted mode, with NCAs as the applications and Nexus
as the OS.
       Normal Mode                  Trusted Mode
Yes, it sounds like it will work exactly like that.  Plus, hopefully
it will be possible for Linux to create its own Nexus ("Linexus"?) that
uses the same hardware features to provide TC capabilities for that OS.
Recall that Linus Torvalds recently adopted the position that DRM was
an acceptable technology for Linux, even when it involved being built
into the kernel.  Since DRM is the main downside to TC for many people,
and TC has many more good aspects beyond DRM, it is a near certainty
that Linux will add support for Trusted Computing.
Right, he could watch all the Disney movies he wanted, without paying
for them!  Mwaa haa haa!  Foolish humans!
But seriously, these systems can only raise the cost of security.
Neither cypherpunks nor Sony should risk their collective lives that no
one will break Palladium, by hook or by crook.

Our Brother wishes for us to meet at the previously discussed
southeastern roadhouse on August 1st, in preparation for the
operations scheduled for August 6th and 9th.
Alternative targets have been chosen.  Contact Jibril if you have not
heard of the changes since the last meeting.  The infidels have machines
that detect the biologicals, so make sure the containers are sealed and
scrubbed as discussed.
Leave excess semtex behind.  The more we transport, the more likely the
infidels are to detect us.
We have received more funding and supplies from our brothers in Saudi
Arabia and Syria.  Be prepared for another operation before January.
Praise Allah!  May the blood of the infidels turn the oceans red!

As of mid 2000 most of traffic is recorded. By this time 'most' is very close to 'all'. But if you e-mail someone with account on the same local ISP, using dial-in at the recipient is also using dial-in, and ISP didn't farm-out dial-in access, then your message may not be backed up forever.

seems to be the "official" Linux thing these days and is portable to the

Also, using pluto suffers from the general FreeS/WAN problem of not allowing
