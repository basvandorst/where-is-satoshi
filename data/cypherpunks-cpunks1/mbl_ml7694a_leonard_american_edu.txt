I think it's entirely appropriate as a discussion re:pragmatics versus law. That's exactly what the PGP in FIDO thread has been about lately. But you're right. We can think of more appropriate examples.

@_subject: NPR and bias 
I'd just like to add a comment on the question of NPR's biases. Yes, they do get most of their funding from the govt, which leads them to take a stance on some issues which agrees with the govt position. On the other hand, virtually the entire mainstream media would be considered biased in favor of the govt by this standard.
        In fact, NPR has a very good journalistic record, and many of its reporters have proven themselves willing to take on the government when they feel the government is wrong.
        Another factor in this equation is the fact that this list does not exactly reach a wide audience, politically or population-wise. We are (as TC May eloquently put it when responding to one of my posts) preaching to the choir here (and a relatively small choir at that). The rest of the world does not necessarily see things the way we do, and we aren't likely to get much sympathy from the owners of commercial media outlets.
        Basically, I think that NPR is the best we're going to get, as far as good exposure is concerned. Yes, they have their faults, but I challenge anyone to show me a single major national media outlet that doesn't.

@_subject: Strong PRNGs 
Does it strike you as ironic that in this atmosphere where "exporting" basically secure products like PGP is illegal, that exporting the tools to generate one of the best possible (in the security sense) encryption systems known to current technology (better than anything that can be implemented in software, anyway) would be _legal_, because it also has ample uses that are unrelated to cryptography?
        If only One Time Pad style systems weren't so kludgey, this would present the _perfect_ solution to our problems with ITAR and the like. Unfortunately, there are some things they can't do. Oh well...
        Please don't bother to tell me that we'd need to physically build hardware to generate seeds for the hash functions, because I already know that. I didn't say it was entirely practical, just that it was an interesting bit of Matthew B. Landry

@_subject: The death of the list as we know it (tm) 
I really think that the powers that be should consider the newsgroup idea. The reasoning above is really the best justification, even though I'd personally kill the code and concentrate on the politics, that's just me. Newsreaders really have much better tools for handling this sort of traffic. (Back when my account was on msen.com, the absolute _only_ way I could possibly read this list was through the gateway to list.cypherpunks. My mailbox couldn't handle a subscription, and I was able to concentrate my time on the _good_ stuff instead of the noise.)
        To the people who say that Usenet has a worse s/n ratio than mail, I have two points. First, not all of Usenet has a bad s/n ratio (and this particular list _does_ have a _very_ bad s/n ratio). Second, the traditionally lower s/n ratio on Usenet has led to the development of better tools to deal with it than are available in mail. (I'd dearly love to see an ignore feature on this list, as I understand that the Extropians have, but I realize that's unrealistic. Even that wouldn't be as effective as a well-designed killfile.)
        I really think this idea deserves at least serious consideration.

@_subject: The death of the list as we know it (tm) 
I'm strongly thinking of doing that. However, I think it would be a shame if we had to operate the newsgroup and the list in paralell, without         And frankly, I don't think it would be entirely a disadvantage to have wider exposure. Sure, we would get some more noise (but we're used to noise by now), but we would also get a much larger readership. We would still be preaching to the choir, but we would have a "choir" large enough that it would no longer be a disadvantage.
        As a compromise solution, perhaps we could have a one-way gateway to a general distribution newsgroup, where posts to the list would automatically go to the newsgroup as well, but posts to the group would only go to the group (unless the person also mailed to the list). The list.cypherpunks group at Msen (where my account was before) was set configured like a moderated group, so all posts got sent to the list, but there's no reason it _has_ to be that way.
        Really, I think there are ways to solve this so that everyone will get what he needs.

@_subject: Newsgroup? 
I still think that people are looking at this idea wrong. If we made the list->news gateway work one-way, so that news traffic wouldn't end up on the list, all of the stated problems could be solved. Except, that is, for TC May's theory about archived postings being grepped by spooks.
        Personally, I think that this is a rather far-fetched idea. If the spooks thought we posed a real threat to them (they might; I don't know), they would have very little trouble grabbing every single character sent to the list now and archiving it all with the best dossier-style cross-indeces in the business. I just think that a newsgroup wouldn't affect that one way or         On the other hand, if the Extropians software is as good as it sounds (and if we actually start using it here), we might not need to have newsreaders to get the same functionality. Sending an "ignore" message to the list software to be processed at the source is a kludge, but it seems to be a Politically Correct kludge, so we might as well use it.

@_subject: Safe and fun environment? 
Unless this list undergoes some VERY radical changes, it will never be a "safe and fun environment" to introduce new people to anything. At the moment, in order to get anything out of it, one has to devote large quantities of queue space and time to the subscription, and sift through the flames and other noise to locate the rare bit of truly valuable info. There are very few people on this list who routinely post things worth reading, and many who _never_ post things worth reading, and seem to be only around for the flame         And god forbid that a newcomer should ask a QUESTION! Dear lord no. That newcomer will be flamed so totally that no burn unit around will be able to save them.
        Most of those that are persistent or resiliant enough to survive what this list can often put people through may or may not decide to stay. I would imagine that such negative experiences would turn a lot of people off to the whole idea of crypto-privacy. If I hadn't already been committed to privacy when I joined the list, I would have immediately unsubscribed, called Fort Meade, and asked what I could do to help.         The vast majority of people who post on this list and respond to other people's posts are obnoxious idiots who are willing to flame at the slightest provocation, and will do so until the person they attack backs down or simply gives up.
        No one on this list is entirely to blame, nor is anyone entirely blameless for this. Several of the top figures on the list (TC May and Eric Hughes to name two) have recently adopted an inappropriately elitist attitude toward the direction of the list, and the movement. No one can stop Eric from running the _list_ however he wants, but the _movement_ belongs to all of us, thank you. Even though I respect the crypto-political opinions that they express a great deal, I think that they and their supporters have taken this too far. And worse, they have not taken a firm stand against the kind of flame war that is continually erupting over individual posts on the list. For the leaders to sit back and watch this go on is simply not the appropriate way to handle things.
        Until we fix the serious problems in this list, it will never be an appropriate environment for newcomers to learn about crypto-privacy, just a training ground for flame-throwers.
        Dare I suggest (why not? I'm already burning to a crisp, how much worse could it get?) that we create a moderated newsgroup that would gateway the substantive traffic from this list into a more accessible forum (but NOT the other way around). In that manner, we could provide a place for newcomers to learn about cryptography and the movement, without forcing them to sift through mountains of flame wars. Questions could be referred to qualified personnel, instead of going to the list where they act like little flame magnets.
        This newsgroup would not replace the list, nor would it be more than marginally connected (because of the selected cross-postings), but it would provide the kind of environment that the list does not or cannot provide.
        Go ahead and dump flames in my mailbox. I've long since gotten used to it. I'm not going to back down until someone convinces me that a hospitable environment with informative traffic and a high s/n ratio is a bad idea. Or, you can save bandwidth and send the flames to /dev/null, because that's where anything that doesn't make sense will go. Rational comments are welcome,         Oh, and for those of you that are tired of seeing me post, you can rest assured that you will never see it again. Contributing to this list has brought nothing but trouble to my life, and I have better things to do with my time than wade through piles of flamage in my personal mail box.

This admonition rings a bell in my mind. Most of the US export laws seem to be based on "export outside US or Canada". So I'm wondering, are the comparable Canadian laws as strict about export of crypto software? Specifically, if US authorities won't stop us from exporting to Canada (placing files on Canadian FTP sites), will Canadian authorities stop us from exporting to Europe, et al. (foreign users FTPing the files from the deposit site)?
        Yes, it's a longshot. No, I don't have all the facts. Yes, I will probably get enough "clueless newbie" flames to set my Ethernet card on fire. I know all of these things. Could someone please answer the question?

@_subject: Disturbing statistics on wiretaps 
I don't know if this specific law is true or not, but a lot of those drug war laws are the type of thing that would make a sane person say "This can't be true". Only it is.
        For example, say that I mow lawns for spare cash as a teenager. When I go off to college here at AU, I pay some of my tuition with money from my lawn savings. AU takes some of my tuition and pays Mariott for providing meal plan service. Mariott pays its staff's wages with the money from AU. The staff pays their rent out of their wages. Perfectly natural chain of events, and it happens all the time.
        Now we introduce a new factor. One of my lawn customers, without my knowledge (because it was none of my business) sold drugs. He put some of the proceeds from the drug sale into my pocket when he paid me for services rendered. _All_ of the assets of _every single person and organization I mentioned above_ are now considered tainted with drug money, and are legally government property. The Mariott corporation would suddenly belong to the DEA. So would everything else. Every single piece of property involved could be auctioned off to the highest bidder, and the government would keep it all.
        Fortunately for AU and Mariott, I never mowed lawns in High School. Thus, I couldn't possibly have drug dealers for customers.
        This is the kind of hysteria-backed power that Joe McCarthy most likely dreamed about. This is the kind of power that Hitler had. This, incidentally, is very much like what Castro did in Cuba that made him so unpopular here in the US.
