Freematt asks question 1:  How do you describe yourself?  What is your world view?
Ian Grigg responds: I'm not sure how a paragraph could do justice to that question!
I'm Australian by passport, although I consider that to be just
part of the mix these days.  I've lived for many years in Spain,
Amsterdam, Britain, and now in Anguilla.  Each has its own
perspective, although Spain had the greatest formative influence
on me in my adult years.
Freematt asks question 7: Where do you see yourself in ten years? What do you want to accomplish both personally and professionally?
Ian Grigg responds: I want to see this financial system built.  For that, we need
partners, lots of them, all acting as equals, as peers.  Intertrader
is a good example.  Their area is in facilitation software for other
people's transactions, our area is in the primary transactions for
trading.  Neither of us wants the other's patch, so we can work
together on a range of projects without egos and greed getting in
the way.
We need other partners that want to issue.  The Hansa Bank, here
in Anguilla, issues our Ricardian dollar.  We'll do the technology,
they do the contract that the users rely upon.
That's really as far as Hansa is prepared to go for the moment,
which is a double-plus for us.  Firstly, we get that critical
money instrument, and secondly, they are minding their knitting,
not trying to create a franchise in wool supply.
We're in the process of creating independantly issued instruments
for trading.  Some of the most exciting opportunities is based on
the work I mentioned above by Hernando de Soto.  We're looking to
take our efficient trading and value management into one of the
world's most inefficient but far-reaching financial systems, that
of microfinance.  I can't really talk about the details, they are
still under wraps, but I can talk about the obvious parts.
At the moment, microfinance is based on huge chains of volunteer
or otherwise soft labour.  Hundreds and hundreds of transactions
are needed to get a circle of five their first loan, in western
terms, the first ten transactions would swallow the principal,
let alone any return on investment.  We aim to change all that,
by giving them transactions and financial industry techniques
that work at their level.
To know that the ideas that we developed are pushing capital out
to small villages, that's a challenge!  Where I can get a $2
transaction in 100 milliseconds and $10 trade in less than a
second, efficiently.  And, do all this into a place where it
would take me 5 days to get there physically;  places with just
a single PC and a satellite dish, but with a repressed urge to
work and work and honestly build their way up and out.  Knowing
that our ideas helped that, that's where I want to be in 10 years.
