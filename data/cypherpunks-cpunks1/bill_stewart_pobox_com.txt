@_subject: Singapore 
Depends on what you're measuring, and how you add non-commensurate
quantities together.  Singapore, for instance, kills drug dealers,
and informs you about that on the papers they hand you when you
enter the country.  I'd consider that a fairly blatant limitation on freedom.
The US occasionally kills drug dealers, and only very rarely if they
haven't committed other crimes, and in general seldom kills other criminals
in spite of the number of politicians who are Tough On Crime.
As far as I know, neither France nor Germany currently has the death penalty,
and they probably have fewer extrajudicial executions than the US.
The US currently won't arrest you for belonging to a political party,
now that the Anti-Communist laws have been trashed in the courts.
France and Germany will only arrest you for belonging to a few
political parties, and allow a lot of political parties that they
don't arrest you for membership in.  Singapore, if I remember,
held one of the leaders of a major opposition party in jail for
a couple of decades under Lee Kwan Yew, and makes it hard for opposition parties to organize and grow.
Singapore lets you work when you want to work, as long as you're
not doing a politically incorrect job like selling chewing gum or dope.
Germany doesn't really mind you selling dope, as long as your
shop is closed by 18:30 weekdays and earlier on Saturday :-)
(Don't think your customers are allowed to order pizza late, either...)
You can feel safe walking down the streets of Singapore at night.
A nice letter to the San Francisco Chronicle pointed out that the
author also felt very safe walking down the streets of Amsterdam.
Safety doesn't require a tyrannical police state or closed value system.
Without economic freedoms, it's difficult to preserve political and
lifestyle freedoms, especially if the economic limitations go beyond
stealing a lot of your money and into micromanaging how you spend it,
e.g. forbidding unlicensed purchases of printing presses or radio stations.
Without political freedoms, it's difficult to preserve economic freedoms;
if you can't organize and vote out a corrupt or big-spending government,
you're stuck between being constantly ripped off, violent revolution
(which is an expensive activity, especially if guns are hard to get),
or evading government officials (whether it's the Mexican system of
usually small bribes to avoid bigger problems, or the Italian system of
rampant cheating on high income taxes, or the Cypherpunks system
of keeping your income invisible and out of reach.)
Usually, tyrannical governments also want to rip off your money,
and corrupt governments want to keep you in your place politically
so they can continue receiving graft.  Occasionally some society
will be stuck with a tyrannical government that realizes it'll have
more power by letting its people make money, or a greedy do-gooder
society that doesn't mind what you do in your spare time as long
as you pay your taxes.  These situations may happen on the way down
(the greedy do-gooder government officials can't paying themselves
high salaries while collapsing the economy so they go for bribery),
or on the way up (tyrannical but honest leader kicks out corrupt small-timers and mafiosi and the people get more economic freedom
and more predictable if still limited personal freedom.)

and the escrow features should require consent.
Furthermore, peer-reviewed encryption isn't dead -

@_subject: Kong Re: Please Beta test my communications cryptography product. 
The web page says that the first beta had some problems, but there
are some good files in its directory, in particular an explanation of
elliptic curves cryptography that avoids most of the math.
The code that's there appears to be visual basic or something similarly unreadable.
Kong is deliberately far simpler than PGP; it looks like it's limited
to the following:
- Signed Message: Delimiter, Message Body, ECC Public Key, ECC Sig.
- Encrypted Message: ECC(SessionKey), RC4(Message Body, SessionKey).    I'm not sure if there are headers that include the recipient's key,
  or if there's any special form for an encrypted-and-signed message.
  I assume there's no multiple-recipient form?
  - there's also symmetric-encrypted form.
- Decrypt Message
- Compare signatures from two messages
It turns out you can replicate many of the functions of PGP
using this set of tools.  And ECC keys are nice and short, so there's
less need for keyservers and such.
- Instead of a keyring, keep a directory of signed messages from people
- To send someone your key, send them a signed message,
- To verify a signature on a new message, compare the signature with one
- To "sign" someone's key, take a message from them, add some introductory
Some technical notes about format:
1) Are the Signer's Name and the ECC key included in the 2) It would be nice if the starting and ending delimiters were different.
3) How are newlines and whitespace in the message body handled for signatures?
4) I'd guess, since you're using 240-bit ECC and base-64 encoding,
5) Is the format of the signature freeform, or do the newlines and Since signed freeform ascii messages from other people can be key certs,
you're not limited to rebuilding reputation capital from scratch.
On the other hand, since certs aren't an automated process,
revocation is tougher than usual to automate as well.
There are three usual reasons for revocation:
1) You've lost all copies of your key (disk crashed, no backups,
2) Someone else found one of your key backup copies.
3) Expiring keys every so often to reduce the risk of 2).

@_subject: hashcash spam prevention & firewalls 
Makes sense to run it in a permissive mode for a while first -
sendmail++ could add hashcash to outgoing messages, and mark the
hashcash information in the headers on incoming messages.
The catch is getting it generated - you've got to include it
either in ISP's outgoing relays, or ideally in client software.
(Since hashcash is mainly for spam prevention, relays _could_
just check that there's some valid hashcash going by without
removing it - that's a bit tricky in multiple-recipient mail anyway,
since you'd normally need to include one hashcash per recipient.)
So if you want it adopted, you'd need to talk to the folks at
Qualcomm Eudora and at Netscape, and see if you can get Microslush
to include it in some of their mail clients.  This does have the
advantage that most of the CPU load is calculated on users' machines,
where there's plenty of spare horsepower, rather than on relay
machines which are not only easily tricked, but also tend to have
about as much horsepower as each of the thousands of clients they serve.
Almost any ISP that provides shell accounts can give you a mechanism for this,
whether it's procmail itself or your own relay program that feeds
your mail to procmail before delivering it to you.
Alternatively, some of the boring commercial services like AOL
have Spam-blocking options, and the pobox.com mail relay does also.
These aren't like having your own procmail, but they'll kill off
the well-known spammers for you, e.g. blocking c y b e r p r o m o
and some of the popular harvester programs that advertise themselves
in mail headers.
That has real trouble with mailing lists.
It also creates a valuable soft-target traffic analysis database;
unlike current sendmail logs, it'll probably stick around for
an extended period of time, and be readily subpoenaed.
At a minimum, such a database should keep keyed hashes of addresses
rather than the addresses themselves - that still makes it possible
to check for individual known addresses, but makes it harder
to go fishing for everybody.  The reason for keyed hashes is to
require dictionary attacks to target individual machines,
but the added work factor for hashing the database of usual suspects
for aol.com, compuserve.com, hotmail.com, juno.com, worldnet.att.net,
demon.co.uk, and relay.national.sg isn't that large.
Also, it's easy for spammers to fake replies to themselves to prime the pump for their big spam.  And if you let mailing lists slide,
they can easily forge mail from the mailing lists.

That doesn't mean "Nobody's allowed to use this for identification."

The only people you can press charges on are government employees

@_subject: hashcash spam prevention & firewalls 
You're both taking the wrong approach - make the originator of the message
generate the hashcash, and make sure the remailer syntax lets them paste it in
as needed.  For chained remailers, generate multiple layers of hashcash.
Maintaining whitelists is a losing game, but unnecessary here.
Mailing lists are still hard, and perhaps best handled by the user's software
(or some fancy variant like user-selectable filters at the ISP mailbox.)
It's hard to tell a real mailing list from a spammer's mailing list,
and both of them do mail explosion and send their mail to names not listed in the To: line, so it's hard to do a technical fix.
There are scads of attacks against any fix, like having disposable_user at juno.com join the mailing list for a while and them spam it.
But remailers are easy.

[Tim posted his article on identity, etc. to cypherpunks and nym;
the discussion I'm replying to is primarily on cypherpunks.]
A third category of requirement is displaying the particular form of identification if you're carrying it - for instance, if you're driving,
and carrying a driver's license, you're obligated to display it,
but if you're walking or a passenger, you're not generally required to,
but some states (in particular California) require that if you're carrying a driver's license you're obligated to show it to any cop who asks.  I don't know if the requirements include handing it over or just displaying.
But lying and refusing to cooperate are different; "You can call me John Doe if you'd like" is not a lie, and Supreme Court cases like Brown vs. Texas have determined that you don't have to tell the police who you are even if they're booking you.
On the other hand, the Supremes let police hold you for up to 48 hours
for no particularly good reason (they have a more formal definition than that :-) so exercising your rights may have a cost.
Tim brings up the issue of identity papers for jury duty -
even if you feel like confusing the poor court bureaucrats
by not bringing the PhotoID with SSN, Thumbprint, and DNA sample,
there's probably a requirement to bring the jury duty summons.
(Depending on your motives, your FIJA membership card is a good backup
ID, or your ACLU card if you've got one - don't leave home without it.)

It's not just price/performance ratio - it's affordable price for adequate performance.
Now that Wintel boxes can crunch integers as well as a Cray-1,
a $2K box has enough horsepower for all but really cutting-edge graphics,
and you're going to buy the same monitor regardless of CPU.
Sure, a $10K SGI probably has far more than 5x the performance,
but not many people need it, especially if they're developing applications for other people to use on cheaper boxes (games...)
as opposed to producing TV shows, music videos, or running
scientific visualization.
That's been a problem for the accounting and office-work for years
- while Microsoft can bloat away any CPU you've got,
an 8086 or 286 box could run spreadsheets, simple chart graphics,
WordStar, a database, BASIC, and Flight Simulator as fast as a PDP-11
for a lot less money, letting the business bootstrap itself
in spite of the ugly excuse for a program loader MS sold for it,
because any developer could afford the $5K (1982) or $2K (1997) box
it takes to develop cool commercially viable applications
(and, yes, you can use a $500 box today, but you wouldn't.)
My 1983 VAX 11/780 cost $400K for a machine with enough horsepower
to support 40-60 users ( A MILLION instructions/sec!  4MB RAM, 1 GB of removable disk, 2 6250bpi tape drives, and a big line printer.)
You might get by spending $250K to support 40 users, including VT100s,
but that's still as much money per seat as a fancy PC, for a
faster but non-graphical environment.  MSDOS was blazingly stupid
and harder to use than Unix, but running on a PC instead of a terminal
makes some things much easier.
If you must run MSware, NT is at least an operating system.
And it's easier to get graphics board manufacturers to write
their drivers for Windows than Linux.

And email to some foreign destinations was inherently suspicious -

@_subject: Is Anonymous Communication only for "Criminals"? (was: Re:  UCENET II and Peter duh Silva) 
It's difficult to do, given the standard settlements arrangement,
though perhaps that may change under the latest confusing rules.
On the other hand, a pay phone carrier _could_ set up their pay phones
with 1-900 numbers (which charge the caller extra) or similar arrangements.
(To avoid burning many 900 numbers, they could have the caller call
1-900-PAYPHON and type in N more digits to specify the phone.)
Besides the privately owned payphones not wanting to receive calls,
the local telephone monopolies would prefer not to have poor people
receiving their phone calls at the local payphone instead of paying
for monthly telephone service, so they don't mind blocking incoming calls.
And mobile business people who use beepers who used to get very annoyed
because they be reached at payphones will just have to buy cellphones;
cellphones cost much less now than a few years ago, and often the
local telephone monopoly is one of the cellphone carriers.
(They're usually also a beeper seller, but that's much more competitive.)
(The last time I went looking for an apartment, I only had a beeper, and
it was _extremely_ annoying not to be able to get callbacks.)
That just leaves sellers and buyers of politically incorrect substances;
the seller can afford a cellphone, but that's too easy to trace,
or a stolen cellphone, but changing the number often makes it hard
for your customers to know your new number.  Meanwhile, the customer can't easily have the seller call back to a payphone.
So the Drug Warriors like banning incoming calls at payphones
(I doubt there's national legislation, but I think there are
local laws in some cities, and the states telephone regulators
probably make it easy also) and the payphone companies don't mind.
The biggest losers are poor people, but nobody cares about them.

You're actually using more cellular infrastructure resources for the call
if you're the callee, because the carrier has to hunt down your phone
to connect to you, and then tie up the same resources during the call.
On the other hand, you can hang up on spam callers, and many services
give you caller id as part of the cell service, so you can trace
who the spammer is that called you much more easily and harass them
right away, as well as getting a bill for it at the end of the month
which you can also use to harass them.

The Worm Before Christmas
By David Bradley, Betty Cheng, Hal Render, Greg Rogers, and Dan LaLiberte
T'was the night before finals, and all through the lab
Not a student was sleeping, not even McNabb.
Their projects were finished, completed with care
In hopes that the grades would be easy (and fair).
The students were wired with caffeine in their veins
While visions of quals nearly drove them insane.
With piles of books and a brand new highlighter,
I had just settled down for another all nighter ---
When out from our gateways arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my desk to see what was the matter;
Away to the console I flew like a flash,
And logged in as root to fend off a crash.
The windows displayed on my brand new Sun-3,
Gave oodles of info --- some in 3-D.
When, what to my burning red eyes should appear
But dozens of "nobody" jobs. Oh dear!
With a blitzkrieg invasion, so virulent and firm,
I knew in a moment, it was Morris's Worm!
More rapid than eagles his processes came,
And they forked and exec'ed and they copied by name:
"Now Dasher! Now Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!
On Comet! On Cupid! On Donner and Blitzen!
To the sites in .rhosts and host.equiv
Now, dash away! dash away! dash away all!"
And then in a twinkling, I heard on the phone,
The complaints of the users. (Thought I was alone!)
"The load is too high!" "I can't read my files!"
"I can't send my mail over miles and miles!"
I unplugged the net, and was turning around,
When the worm-ridden system went down with a bound.
I fretted. I frittered. I sweated. I wept.
Then finally I core dumped the worm in /tmp.
It was smart and pervasive, a right jolly old stealth,
And I laughed, when I saw it, in spite of myself.
A look at the dump of that invasive thread
Soon gave me to know we had nothing to dread.
The next day was slow with no network connections,
For we wanted no more of those pesky infections.
But in spite of the news and the noise and the clatter,
Soon all became normal, as if naught were the matter.
Then later that month while all were away,
A virus came calling and then went away.
The system then told us, when we logged in one night:
"Happy Christmas to all! (You guys aren't so bright.)"

I don't know if the Onion Router stuff is still web-only or if it's

build an IRC laundry without much difficulty, but you'd have to trust
the administrators.  IPSEC provides privacy for communications,
but doesn't protect the connection information very well,
though IPSEC between firewalls is at least a partial mix.
Once IPSEC is widely deployed, it may be interesting to piggyback a pipenet-like system on top of it, basically a
bogus-traffic generator that's keeps packet levels fairly constant.

Also, there was a really appalling court case in the 1890s
(Plessey vs. Ferguson), in which the Supremes ruled that states
could require segregation with separate but equal accommodations;
it was somewhat overturned by Brown vs. Board of Education in 1954,
but the idea that the government can tell you how to run your business
is long established (after all, we'd need much smaller governments
if they couldn't be interfering in business.)
A Denny's restaurant in Maryland had two groups of customers
show up one day, one group black, one group white, both about 6-8 people,
both arriving at the same time, both groups out-of-uniform cops.
The white people got served promptly, the blacks got served
extremely late and rudely.  And sued, and won.
(I was mainly surprised that the white cops got served fast;
my experience in Denny's has almost always been slow bad service,
except for one restaurant in Pennsylvania that hasn't learned
how to act like a real Denny's :-)

Easy, Constitutional, and doesn't need any new legislation - all you need is a warrant or subpoena to tell anybody to
produce those records and materials they have.
If they didn't save a recording of their telephone call or email,
or think the Fifth Amendment reasonably prohibits them
from being compelled to incriminate themselves,
then the prosecution doesn't get anything.  No problem,
and it's worked quite well for 200+ years.
There may be cases where there's some foreign jurisdiction
over communications with US persons, either travellers or
emigrants to those governments' territories, and they can
use whatever methods are locally popular; some of them,
like torture, tend to require strongly worded notes
from the State Department complaining about such behaviour.
But as you say, I think not, and no, they don't get it.
Just because Leahy is willing to allow businesses to export
things doesn't mean he isn't a tool of Big Brother.

If you're in the Retail Pharmaceuticals business, trying to

it's much simpler than solving the problem for The Masses.
Steal some cellphones, or steal some credit cards and buy some
cellphones, or hire a street person to rent a cell phone for you.
If the cops know they're looking for cellphone 202-654-3210,
they can call you, but they don't know who you are,
and even direction finders may only tell them that
the holder of that phone is somebody walking down Pennsylvania Ave.
On the other hand, if the cops are looking for _you_,
they may not have your phone number.
The Cheesebox story was quite nice, and would work better today, with automated PBXs available - it would have worked
even better 10 years ago, when PBX hacking was easier.
Another small-scale solution is to use ham radio repeaters with
phone patches, assuming they're still widely available.
Tracing it tells the cops they need to go find an FCC RDF truck
to drive around South Silicon Valley looking for someone
with a pocket-sized 2m or 70cm handheld radio who doesn't
talk more than 1 minute at a time, or maybe just listens.
If they catch you, you could be in Big Big Trouble for using
a ham radio without a license!
Another part of the scale is that not only is tracing a lot of work,
as others have pointed out, but not everybody goes taunting
Tsutomo and continually reminding everybody that they
haven't yet caught him, the way Dread Pirate Mitnick allegedly did.
If you're just Yet Another Pot Dealer, the FBI, NSA and FCC will probably tell your local police that a 75-gram dope deal is
less important that Cliff Stoll's 75-cent accounting difference.
On the other hand, maintaining a professional level of paranoia
all the time while doing business for a few years is more than
most FBI Targets are willing to bother doing.

@_subject: text analysis 
RAM is cheap - any 486 computer and most 386 computers has at least 4MB.
In the US, most new PCs have 16MB or more, and many have 64MB.
But learning how to program efficiently is still important :-)
And some computers have operating systems that make it hard
to use all of the RAM.
Disk is cheaper - almost all new computers have 1GB or more,
and most older desktops have at least 200MB.
You probably should use 32-bit integers to store your counters,
but you need to make sure your program does the right thing
if you exceed counts of 2**31.
Are you counting all kinds of text, or only words made of alphabetic
characters and spaces and punctuation, or only ASCII 127-bit?
Your 1024 number is 32*32, which sounds like only alphabetic and spaces;
if that's good enough, you could do 32*32*32*32 with 4-byte counts
and still fit in 4MB.
If you want all 256 possible 8-bit characters, two characters requires 64K counters (256KB).   Trigrams require 16 million counters
if you allocate space for them all, which is 64MB, and may be expensive.
But you could store 256*256 pointers in 256KB, and allocate memory
for 256-counter arrays only for the digrams that appear,
and probably save lots of memory.  You could also store the counts on disk, and keep only the more frequently used arrays of counts in RAM.
This was how we did things in the old days, when almost everything
was too big for RAM, and it really is much slower if you're not careful :-)
If you have a machine with a real operating system, you can pretend keep your counters in RAM and let the operating system
decide what to page out to disk.  Think about this carefully,
because it can be very fast or very slow depending on how
well you write your programs.

@_subject: compression vs encryption 
Compression makes stuff smaller; encryption keeps stuff private.
Compression works by not sending data you don't need -
there are lossless compression systems, like simple run-length encoding
and more complex systems like Huffman and Lempel-Ziv,
which build abbreviations for common strings, and lossy compression systems like some JPEG and MPEG modes
and most voice compression systems which discard information
that doesn't have much effect on the user's perception of the image/sound.
You can find books on compression techniques, and can find
compression discussed in general books on algorithms.
For lossless compression, you can get by knowing simple math,
like probability and statistics, though it helps to know
about polynomials and modular arithmetic and such. For image compression, it helps to know about discrete cosine transforms and that sort of math.  Audio compression includes simple techniques like
Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation, for which a little
calculus is helpful but not too critical, and complex techniques
using frequency spaces, Fourier transforms, and various models
of the human vocal tract, for which you need more math.
RLE is simple, and can work well or badly depending on the data.
For each set of repeated characters, it sends the character and count.
If the data usually has long runs of values, e.g. lots of black
and lots of white, it wins; if most values happen once in a row, it loses.
With Huffman coding, the input strings are usually the same length,
e.g. single letters, and the output strings are variable length,
with short output strings used for more frequently used inputs,
and longer output strings used for less frequently used inputs;
the more you know about the statistics of the input stream,
and the more unbalanced the statistics are, the smaller the output.
With Lempel-Ziv, the output strings are almost-constant length
indexes into a table of input strings which is built dynamically,
so the first time the compressor sees a string "ab", it creates a
table entry and sends the entries for "a" and "b", and the next time it sees "ab", it sends the code for "ab" (and also creates the code for "abc", if "c" is the next entry....)
There are also books about encryption.
Bruce Schneier's book "Applied Cryptography" is popular and good.
Most encryption systems compress their plaintext before encrypting,
partly because it's usually faster, partly because you can't
make encrypted text smaller by compressing it, and partly because
it can be more resistant to attacks like known-plaintext and chosen-plaintext.
If evil people can get on your system, you lose.
Encryption is part of protecting a system, but not enough.
Encrypting your disk drives helps reduce the risk if
they steal your computer (when police steal computers,
they use fancy words like "subpoena" and "confiscate", but it's the same thing :-).  Encrypting your email
means that evil people can't read it when it's in transit.
But if they can break in to your machine because you're using Windows or a badly-configured Unix system,
they may be able to read your mail or files before you encrypt them,
or read your incoming mail after you decrypt it,
or replace your encryption program with something that
also lets them decrypt the mail, and you still lose.

@_subject: Internet is rickety 
This isn't coderpunks material; I'm copying to cypherpunks instead.
(I've also removed letters at sjmercury.com from the Cc:.)
Physical damage is one thing; logical-level damage is another.
Some newer vulnerabilities are the DNS system and routing protocols.
There was a major DNS failure a year or so ago when NSI or one of the
root servers published a garbled database; I don't remember details.
That's annoying, but easily noticed, and easy to work around,
and easier to prevent happening in the future.  But it's also easy
to trick the DNS root servers from outside (as Kashpureff did),
or mess with them inside (I forgot why Postel did that recently.)
A more serious problem occurred when some small ISP misconfigured
their Border Gateway Protocol parameters, announcing to the whole world
that their little T1 line was the best way to get almost anywhere
from almost anywhere else.  This was only mildly untrue until a
few large providers updated their tables to reflect it, at which point
their T1 started to melt, taking much of the Internet down with it.
This kind of thing _can_ happen again; the interesting problem
is what if somebody deliberately starts doing it a lot....
And much of the world's traffic goes through MAE-WEST and MAE-EAST,
as a way of getting between ISPs, though bigger carriers
have direct connections between their networks, and many small ISPs
at least have direct connections to their continent-wide carriers.
The MAEs and other NAPs get slow fairly often, and occasionally
just get fried; a major outage could be a serious problem,
so the fact that MAE-EAST lives in a parking garage in the DC area
may or may not bother you.
That's three ways that the whole Internet can have serious trouble;
there are presumably a number of others, if you believe in Murphy
or believe the L0pht's announcements.
Then there are more subtle problems - what happens if Altavista dies?
(Yes, there are other search engines, but probably 3-5 major ones.)
And there are the increasing number of portal and free email services from
Hotmail, Excite, Altavista, MyYahoo, Netscape, etc.,
which will take out large numbers of users' mail access if any of them dies.
And then there's AOL, which is probably a pretty robust design,
and which may or may not be missed by people on the _real_ Internet
if it dies for a while, but could also cut off lots of users from the net.
Also, much of the robustness derives from having _enough_ excess bandwidth
in the network that if you lose a good chunk of it, you'll still have
enough for the remaining users (the nuclear war scenario does reduce
the user population as well as the network...)  But you can get into
localized problems, for example the cable cut that trashed uunet's access to Florida the other week, and the Internet doesn't have a widespread priority
mechanism to identify "more important" traffic, though there are
many mechanisms for prioritizing individual users' networks.
It still works pretty well, but that doesn't mean it's not rickety.

Based on the talk by Elizabeth Kaufman from Cisco at the Bay Area

this is the first "compromise" I haven't rabidly disliked.)
(Elizabeth says not to blame her for the name, it's Cisco's PR folks' fault.)
The Private Doorbells proposal says that routers that encrypt
have a clear side and a black side, and if you want to wiretap them,
you can already wiretap the clear side, so Louis Freeh should be happy enough
(since it meets the "legitimate needs of law enforcement",
even though it the blocks no-warrant no-knock wiretaps he'd really like) so just give us the export permits we want and stay off our backs.
There's no special key escrow in the routers, it's just
doing what encrypting routers do already, and if Big Louie wants
to wiretap an ISP today, he can try to get a warrant and then do it.
It seems to me that there's a minor catch - routers with
multiple private-line encrypted interfaces can decrypt and
encrypt traffic without ever hauling it through an Ethernet
where it'd be easy to tap, but most of those configurations
still have an Ethernet somewhere, and any Bad Guy who's doing encryption
at the endpoints ought to be using end-to-end encryption anyway.

Not in any way that matters, and this _is_ a critical free-market point.
Yes, rich folks can pay for eternity services that carry all the
information they care about, just as they can pay for web pages they want,
because they've got money to burn and can overpay for it,
while you politically correct poorer folks can pay for the information
you want, but only if it's economically viable, just as with the web.
Get used to it.  Information storage isn't an economic good like land,
where they ain't making any more of that stuff, so if rich people
can outbid you for the fixed supply you lose - it's a good that
increases in supply as money gets thrown at people who generate it,
and having rich people making the cover traffic grow is a Good Thing.
As has been discussed on this list before, there are two main
components to the cost - the cost of storage and the cost of retrieval.
Storage keeps getting radically cheaper and larger every year, and
you could provide storage forever for about twice the cost of one year's storage, assuming minimal inflation and continual technology improvement.
On the other hand, the cost of retrieval depends on how often the
document is accessed, as well as for how long - you could probably provide
a fixed N accesses per year forever for a low fixed price,
because bandwidth will keep getting cheaper,
but to accommodate any volume of retrievals, you need to charge
per access, either as digicash or perhaps substitutes such as banner ads
if they bring in enough revenue (Geocities apparently thinks they do.)

But the posting about the Blair Administration taking their

I've been going through yet another round of airline security people
imposing some new requirement and claiming it's "always been that way" or
"been that way for a long time, ever since I started working here."
The latest round is wearing hats through the X-Ray machine - they insist you take your hat off, even if you didn't beep,
and that it's an "FAA requirement".  San Jose started doing this about a year ago, but this is the first time San Francisco has done so, even though they claim otherwise
(though I probably haven't worn a hat there since last rainy season.)
Most people who wear hats at San Jose airport are Mexicans in
cowboy hats, who probably don't care all that much; I'd expect that
the first guard at LaGuardia or Kennedy who tries to insist
that the Lubavitchers take their hats off in submission to the government
will find themselves surrounded by annoyed bearded men talking

Personally, I wear a hat because it keeps my head from getting cold,

and while I don't have any religious rules requiring me to wear a hat,
I _am_ a Quaker, and we have a history of getting uppity about

John Gilmore has proposed setting up crypto archives in
many countries to avoid Wassenaar restriction problems.
Does anybody have a good source for information on web hosting providers
or other ISPs in a variety of countries around the world?
Shell accounts are nicer, because it's easier to create
servers that check where the request is coming from,
for countries that insist you only provide access to their citizens
but still allow you to do that on a web site.  The US doesn't
appear to have strictly defined legal requirements for such sites (YET)
and places like MIT have gotten quite flexible about it.
Also, are there any good sources of relatively private VISA
credit cards, preferably outside the US, that can be used
to rent computer accounts with?
There are other crypto distribution methods that, while slower,
are still legal from the US - censoring printed books embarasses
them a bit still, though some other countries don't have
the same squeamishness even though they may be less interested
in banning the material.  Printing PGP source books was annoying,
but a week's delay in shipping few-page crypto subroutines
isn't that serious, especially if it's in a scanner-friendly format.
Any guess how the various countries feel about faxes of source code?
And, of course, shipping or even selling source for 40-bit RC4
and 512-bit RSA is pretty simple, even if you don't include the note

It does somewhat resemble inviting vampires into your home,
in that it's a bad idea, they can do whatever they want when

On the other hand, vampires usually can't get search warrants,
while police usually can. :-)
A while back, maybe 5 years ago, I posted a copy of an article
called "Don't talk to cops" or "Don't talk to police",
which may still be in the archives somewhere.  Its advice was somewhat New York State oriented, but applies
reasonably generally throughout the US for the case of
police coming to your home (car searches are different,
and vary far more by state.)
Not true in California.  If you *possess* a California Driver's License, and have it on your person, and a California cop asks you to produce it, you are required to do so, even if you're not driving.  You're not required to carry it if you're not driving,
but if you are carrying it, you've got to fork it over.
This may not apply if you're on your own property - I don't think that that variant has been tested in court.
But if you're on public property, you've got to provide it.
If you live in other states, it's worth knowing the local regs
about such things as well.

Certainly we've got no problem with that here :-)
Ok, it has happened, and the tools that people built dealing
with Detweiler(s) and spammers have been the beginnings of things
we'd need in the future anyway.
In this case, it's "wants to get everybody to export crypto and get busted",
but the good guys do that too.
I was once at a roughly 10-person protest against the previous day's workers-without-identity-papers bust by the local La Migra, cops, and press,
and one of the folks from "Refuse and Resist" who showed up kept saying we should go out and bust the sheriff's departments' heads.
Maybe he was just a bad peacenik as opposed to a provocateur.
The classic way that Commies recognized infiltrators during the
Red Scare days was that they were the ones who paid their dues :-)
In the cypherpunk business, nobody's unemployed, they're just
computer consultants, or freelance journalists, or professional investors, or retired successful entrepreneurs, or financial privacy consultants
who attend money laundering conventions, so this one's no help;
might as well suspect folks who are long-term employees of
telecommunications monopolies or defense contractors.....

Donaldson's law suggests that Sturgeon was an optimist,

At least its meaning is generally clear in context,
unlike some of the popular post-modernist drivel,

Similarly, IRC and CuSeeMe appear to be nym-oriented rather than
real-sounding-name-oriented.  AOL isn't exactly the internet,
but it tends to use screen names.  I'm not sure about ICQ, but I think it's also nym-oriented, and it's got 10 million or so users.
The Better Business Bureau has been around much longer than that?
Ward Christiansen, inventor of XModem, also credits himself with
inventing the "first" BBS in 1978.  Perhaps it was the first for
cheap PCs, but I'd already been using the Plato Notesfile system for about 3 years by then, which was really just a better BBS running on a much more expensive computer and terminals
(plus it had multiplayer interactive Space War :-)
and it wasn't too new when I started using it.
And ARPAnet mailing lists had been around for quite a while before 78,
as well as mailing lists in the BITnet/CSnet/Phonenet environments.
Usenet emerged around 1981, and for the first few years was
primarily running on dialup UUCP as well as higher-speed LANs
of various sorts.

It should probably reduce them a bit, depending on your UPS design,
but if you have to worry about people monitoring your electricity
for contraband bits, you've got a whole raft of other things
you'd better start taking care of, like disk encryption and
offsite backups and signs on the door indicating that you

The converse is that if you've got an electrical filtering system
as part of your TEMPEST protection, whether it's in your computer's

clean power feeding your computer, which is a Good Thing.

@_subject: Jury Duty 
The Fully Informed Jury Association web page is  .
They've been the primary organization promoting Jury Nullification issues
for the last N years, and there's some good material there.
The question I'd ask is why you _want_ to get off jury duty.
Just to avoid wasting your time?  Don't like courts or the current laws?
Don't like having to judge other people?  Generally cantakerous? :-)  If the problem is wasting your time, how much time gets wasted
depends a lot on your county.  Most counties call far more people
than they need to be potential jurors, just in case they need them,
and take different approaches for winnowing down to the numbers
they actually need for real cases.  The place I live now makes you
call a recorded message every night to see if your number's come up.
On the other hand, a county I used to live in made you show up
in person for the first four days whether you were needed or not,
and this was before laptop computers so I couldn't do much work there.
Another county I lived near makes the lawyers all show up Monday,
and takes care of all the jury selection that day.
On the other hand, if you are picked, and the trial is expected
to take a long time, the voir dire process generally includes
asking if this is going to cause a major hardship,
which is why juries on those cases are usually made up of
retired schoolteachers, retired military, and postal workers.
But most county jury trials seem to be civil cases, like car accidents
and such, which are usually pretty quick.
For criminal cases, the job of the jury has always been to judge
the law and its applicability as well as the facts of the case,
regardless of what the judge and prosecutor tell you
(though the judge's instructions on the law usually are
relatively good advice.)  If you think the law's bad,
like drug laws, or being applied unfairly in the case at hand,
or that the penalties are way out of line for the crime,
you can vote not guilty, and you can try to convince your
fellow jurors to do the same.  Your duty is to vote your conscience.
Alternatively, if you really want to get out of jury duty anyway,
handing out FIJA literature in the jury pool waiting room
and discussing the issues with your fellow potential jurors
should either get you thrown out quickly, because they don't
want your subversive kind around, and similarly,
if you get as far as the jury selection process,
being an intelligent and opinionated type often makes
you an undesirable juror in either civil or criminal cases,
so they may still reject you.  But if you're the political activist type, rather than just trying to get out of jury duty, you can get stuck on some automobile accident or dog bite lawsuit where there's basically no FIJA issue at all and you're just
deciding who's 65% at fault and how much pain and suffering
their whiplash really caused :-)

Well, depending on time zones, I may have just missed your deadline,
but it's pretty close.  It shouldn't be that tough to do - get some anthrax*, and go find a flock of sheep and ask for volunteers willing to help their country.  Any that don't run away fast enough
will do, so herd them into pens where you can manage them.
Give them some skin cuts and dust them with your starter supply.
When they get infected enough and die, collect the pus from the wounds
and handle it carefully, preferably with gas masks and rubber gloves.
Now that you've replenished your starter supply, deposit the used sheep on the Pentagon's front step, light some black candles, ring the doorbell, and run.
Alternatively, if you don't like killing poor cute mammals that are
even dumber than Democrats, you can grow the stuff in Petri dishes.
More seriously, though, anthrax isn't some exotic hard-to-grow disease;
before modern sanitation and plastic brush bristles, there were at least occasional problems with anthrax infection in shaving brushes and
hairbrushes made with bristles from infected pigs, and training for barbers
included sterilizing brushes to prevent it.  The trick is in making sure
you don't get infected yourself, and also in manufacturing it in
military quantities and militarily-convenient delivery systems.
If all you're trying to do is smuggle it into the Pentagon cafeteria
or the Yankee Stadium hot dog stands, rather than take out a whole city
like government-employed terrorists do, it's not that tough.
A more appropriate distribution approach would be for a US-based Iraqi
to fire a Stinger missle at one of the US Army's Chemical or Biological
Warfare development facilities.  After all, the White House has announced
that blowing up weapons of mass destruction is a Good Thing....
[ *Anthrax is a naturally-occurring organism, so it's not cheating to
start the process with "get some Anthrax" rather than by synthesizing it.]

While I agree with the need to discourage interventionist foreign policy,
and especially to keep the US from using terrorism as an excuse for further
erosions of civil liberties at home and as an excuse for maintaining
and finding new work for the increasingly-unnecessary standing army,
I have to disagree with the notion that US foreign policy was "restrained" for its first 150 years - it was just focused on "our" Western Hemisphere.
The first 40-50 years were primarily occupied with the British,
but also included the Louisiana Purchase and consolidation of control
and wars with the Indian Nations in that territory, plus the
"Monroe Doctrine" which said that the Western Hemisphere was the US's,
and no other colonialism could happen, though we weren't quite ready yet.
But after that, it was open season for the "Manifest Destiny" expansionists,
conquering Northern Mexico (with some Texan help), subjugating any Native tribes that the Mexicans hadn't done in, taking the rest of North America
between Canada and the now-smaller Mexico, including Washington and Oregon,
though they were restrained enough not to carry out "54 40' or Fight!".
During the middle of this period, there was that nasty little event,
the Reconquest of the Confederacy.  While the southern states had
seceeded primarily to protect slavery, and the US invasion was
largely driven by nationalists who wanted America to control as
much of North America as it could.
Then there was the Teddy Roosevelt conquest of Spanish Caribbean territory,
with the additional bonus of the Philipines,
and a century of intervention in places like Haiti and Nicaragua
(when did the Marines first go there?  1905?).  Much of US intervention
in Latin America was on behalf of fruit and sugar companies,
just as the conquest of the Kingdom of Hawai'i had been,
and it was only after WWII that they could blame it on Commies.

@_subject: Question about 'TEMPEST': UPS 
Neither one will make a dent from a Tempest perspective,
though the foil might disperse heat enough to protect your dope farm :-)
Bettter to build an RF-tight box for your PC and use fiber cables,
and you'll still need to do really special power filtering.
The Army used to use copper screen cages for computers back in the 70s,
which got about 60dB worth of shielding.  When I ran a TEMPEST-shielded
room in the mid-80s, the specs said (roughly) that you needed 100dB
of shielding for a room with computers in it, and the room technology
we used gave about 110-120dB depending on how tight our door gaskets were.
It used particle board with sheet metal on both sides and special
edge/corner joints, and you packed copper-wool into any loose area
and copper tape on any flat areas that had leaks.  At the time you needed to be very careful about joints between anything,
because RF just _leaks_, and we watched frequencies up to about 450MHz,
since then-current computer equipment didn't have harmonics at
anything like that high a frequency - but it still didn't take much
of a leak to peg the meters, in spite of that being a .6 meter wavelength.
Well, 1.5MIPS Vaxen are a bit out of date now, 300MHz Pentiums are common,
and they've got all sorts of harmonics out there.
If you want a penetration in the walls, e.g. for air or fiber optic cables,
you needed some ratio I've forgotten between the depth and width of the hole;
A two-inch deep hole could be about 1/4" across -- your 1/2" flat chickenwire
would be pretty transparent.
There's newer stuff now - some kind of carbon-fiber cloth with aluminum in it
that's really nice to wallpaper with, but you still need to handle
all the joints, which is tough to do.
Other than protecting your dope farm, tin foil's not real useful,
though I suppose you could line your hat with it to keep microwaves out :-)
What's scary is that I _have_ seen a catalog (mostly NewAgey health scams)
that sold RF-shielded hats; I forget if they were metal-lined or carbon-fiber.

@_subject: distribution scheme 
At 09:53 AM 12/22/98 +0100, Falcon, aka FitugMix ,
wrote about a suggestion to chop crypto or other contraband material into separate streams, e.g. bit 1 of each byte in stream 1, etc.,
hoping that this would be "legal" because it's not really encryption,
though if managed carefully it would still be hard to read.
That's of course a distinct question from "will this make the
information hard enough to notice that I won't get caught?";
the answer to that question depends on many factors besides the
direct details themselves, like who you use this to send things to,
and how you advertise the things you make available to send, etc.
I'm not only not a US lawyer, I'm also not a German lawyer,
or a Chinese lawyer, or a Russian lawyer, and you're not paying me,
so this is not legal advice :-)  But my strongly considered engineering opinion is "Don't bet on it if it really matters."
If you use the system to distribute a copyrighted work,
you've still distributed a copyrighted work, even if you've shredded the paper and shipped the shreds and sticky-tape.  No win.
And if you try this in a country like China, where the laws are
arbitrary and defined on the spot, the fact that you may not have
violated the letters of a written law is potentially irrelevant.
The Chinese government is currently threatening to execute someone
who distributed 30000 email addresses of mainland Chinese to some
foreign human-rights activists - "assisting enemies of the state"
is seldom a well-defined crime; only the punishment is consistent. On the other hand, in countries that have well-defined laws,
and law enforcement organizations and courts that only enforce
the laws that are defined, and always want to enforce them correctly,
it can be entertaining to play with technologies like this.
Sometimes this gets them to change the rules, usually administratively
rather than through a public political process, but sometimes
it can make them look silly and feel bad about what they're doing.
Ron Rivest's "Chaffing and Winnowing" protocol is a great example,
and you can find details on your favorite web search engines.
Basically, you define an authentication checksum that uses a key,
so only the sender and the intended recipient can validate a checksum.
Then you send a series of entries like
where the checksum is correct depending on whether the bit N of the message
is a 0 or a 1.  There is no encryption used - only authentication,
so it's perfectly legal in some jurisdictions, but only the recipient
can tell which bits are "wheat" and which bits are "chaff".
One of the cool things about it is that you don't need to use
fake material as chaff - somebody else's wheat works just as well,
because the checksums fail if you use your key on their bits.
It's a very inefficient protocol, but there are ways to make it
less bad (not *good*, but at least less bad.)

Unfortunately, since Wassenaar is not the law, only an agreement
by bureaucrats to make laws or regulations sort of like it if
they can talk their pet legislatures into rubberstamping them,
this doesn't help.  You can't take a bureaucrat to court and insist that she rescind a regulation that was stronger than the Minimum Daily Repression specified in the "Arrangement" -
you can only insist on whatever your nation's constitution (if any)
or fundamental rights document (if any) specifies, or perhaps go to the World Court or some European Union or European Community court and argue the case there.
But most of these rights documents say things like
"except for national security" and aren't very enforceable
even if they do plainly state that your rights are stronger than that.
I assume you mean 3DESDecrypt(backwards(k),x) ?  It still doesn't work,
because 3DESEncrypt is still symmetric with 3DESDecrypt,
and SED3Decrypt is still symmetric with 3DESEncrypt(backwards(k),x).
But you could still come up with something that meets the
letter of the non-law, just for the fun of tweaking them.
I think it's more realistic to go for the various
General Software Exemptions and Public Domain Exemptions,
and generally lobby legislatures to slow down on implementing Bad Things,
and let them see there's money to be made for their countries' local businesses by not cooperating.  A potentially valuable change to go for would be to allow export between members of the Wassenaar, or the EC, or whatever.
After all, the whole purpose of the COCOM that Wassenaar grew out of
was to keep Commies from getting militarily valuable technology,
and now that there aren't any Commies (unless you count the Chinese or Cubans)
and they've let the Russians into Wassenaar, the whole thing's
prima facie stupid anyway.

You'd lose a class action suit.  More important is to get them to close

The other problem is just that they're big enough that if even a small
fraction of their customers are spammers, lots of spam comes from their
customers; at least they don't encourage it, unlike some providers.
If you want to cut way down on spam, there's Paul Vixie's
Realtime BlackHole List service at maps.vix.com.  It uses DNS as a convenient query/response server and some short sendmail scripts
to block mail from any site known to have an open smtp relay.
They're fairly zealous, and don't mind throwing away a few extra babies to get rid of lots of bathwater, so if you don't want to block
everybody that they block you'll need to hack some sendmail configs.
My main frustration is that they block mail from the ix.netcom.com
smtp servers, which blocked mail from me to the PGP-users list,

They're going to offer digital signature certificates
with the usual binding of a key to a body plus papers,
and provide software to support it.  Some of their software
can be used for encryption, and unfortunately they're
going to offer key escrow, though as a separate business
service, with keys encrypted by the key's corporate owner
as well as by the bank for protection, but it's not
going to be a mandatory service, and they have no intention
of offering escrow for signature keys, only encryption keys.
Their documentation does talk a good bit about crypto technology,
in layman's terms, and about risk management and Y2000 compliance,
and also in great detail about how things like this are
standard banking functions applied in a digital environment
(to convince the OCC to let them offer it, since they're a bank

Well, if I'd been thinking about it, I'd have put some rubber cement and

More the issue at the time was that the politicians were
busy deciding that your ability to drive safely obviously depended
on whether your citizenship papers were in order (the month
I got it they'd temporarily stopped doing that.)
I recently renewed the license, and they didn't ask for papers
or thumbprints, but they still don't print the license at the remote DMV offices; they print them centrally because it simplifies
verifying your information with the INS thugs.
The citizenship papers issue has basically doubled the market
for counterfeit licenses; it's not just excessively bad drivers
who bribe DMV employees any more.
Back when I lived in New Jersey, the cops would set up traffic stops
not only to look for drunk drivers (at 9am?!), but also to check
if your papers were in order.  I haven't seen much of that in California,
but presumably the Southern part of the state does it more often
to catch Spanish speakers who are loose in the population.

If there were no copyright, markets for information and entertainment
would definitely have evolved differently than they have in the US
and Europe, and would use much different mechanisms for getting money
to the producers of information, such as standard sale contracts.*
On the other hand, if there were no colonialism, markets for sheep in
New Zealand would have evolved much differently than they did,
a problem they're now gradually working their way out of.
The music business, for example, handles paying authors when their works
are performed by performers through mechanisms other than just
charging big bucks for sheet music.  The Free Software Foundation found
that with a bit of academic and military socialism to jump start it,
there are a lot of reasons for people to create value and beauty,
and you can even talk corporations into paying money for support.
Van Gogh found good reasons to paint, in spite of being broke.
Michaelangelo found good reasons to paint, and Gutenberg found
good reasons to print, in spite of not having copyright protection.
Newspapers eveolved in an environment where copyright wasn't a big deal;
if your competitors ripped off your stories, they were a day late,
and you could rag them about it in your own paper.
Mainframe software evolved in an environment where contracts
covered use of the software, and copyright was seldom relevant;
that has gradually changed with mass-market computers, but
it took a while for courts to accept the idea of copyrighting
software, and the industry didn't refrain from writing the stuff.
Copyright is certainly a major market convenience, because it means
that individual authors, middlemen, and readers don't have to
negotiate contracts each time they trade information for money,
or having to read the annoying shrink-wrap licenses on books
the way they did for a while on packaged software.  It also
makes it more difficult for alternative mechanisms to evolve,
because it's got an 800-pound well-armed gorilla subsidizing it.
If I read Mark's note correctly, the gorilla he was talking about
wasn't MicroSloth, it was the government.  We may joke about Gates
being the Evil Empire, but it's clearly a joke; we've seen the real thing.
and in a following note, Jim says that that's true mainly for the
long run, not necessarily for the short run.  It's not only incorrect,
especially as expanded upon, it's irrelevant to the moral question.
If your alternatives are free markets, where you and I can offer to buy or sell products without anybody beating us up for it,
versus non-free markets, where some gang can beat us up for
not going along with the program (whether the gang is the Mafia,
the Pinkertons, the KGB, or "your neighbors in a democracy"),
there's no question which is morally acceptable - even if the
violence-based market is often more convenient for some goods.
But morality aside,  monopoly, in the sense of a single player
or small group of players domination the sales of a commodity,
is something that can certainly happen in the short run but is
unstable in the long run unless the competition can be prevented
by threats of violence (whether by the monopoly or the government.)
If people are free to offer competing products, maintaining market
share is difficult, and the market leader not only has to contend
with the other big dogs, but with being nipped to death by Chihuahuas,
and with being made obsolete by better technologies.
Who monopolizes tabletop radios these days?  (Who cares?)
Who monopolizes Video Cassette Recorders?  They're both relatively free markets, in spite of the FCC's attempts to enforce standards,
and Sony's attempts to monopolize the BetaMax market.
On the other hand, radio and TV broadcasting are near-monopolies,
because the Feds have been "helping" protect our public airwaves.

Sharewise, that's not bad for a system that had 1 million users a year or two ago, though of course it gains a lot of extra slack

Getting that much desktop support without running MSOffice is

[Warning: while this may _look_ like just another rant,
there is some technical content below.]
Gates got rich not by selling good software, but by selling software
very well.  Copyright is part of the process, but it's possible to
sell your product to computer manufacturers with any customization
they need using contracts instead of copyright to make your money.
It's also possible to do copy protection in your software;
games makers do this because they're widely pirated by non-point-source
attacks (kids, mostly) who are hard to track down and sue,
unlike major computer manufacturers who are easier to find,
both to sue if needed or to provide support for.
Copy protection was one of the things people hated about Lotus 123;
I don't remember Excel or MS-DOS ever having it.
When I've used expensive commercial software on Sun computers, it often needs to be registered with the machine serial number, or used with a floating license server, and refuses to run without it.
PCs don't have built-in serial numbers, but they probably would
if Gates had insisted on it early enough.  Because of copyright law
he didn't _have_ to use technical means of copy protection,
so the Copyright Enforcers have saved him money - but they've
also saved us the aggravation of dealing with copy protection wares.
If you _want_ a serial number on each PC for your product,
dongles are an available option.  They reduce portability somewhat,
but software like Banyan Vines networking uses them on its servers.
So even the fact that IBM and Mr.Bill didn't install one doesn't
stop you from using them - and as anti-crypto law goes away,
uncrackable dongles are becoming easier to make (I don't know if
anybody bothers, though.)

FCC specs aren't real tight.
My old laptop*, which passed FCC specs (at least when it was new,
before being hauled around on airplanes and trains, dropped a few times,
having cooked parts replaced, and generally getting treated like a laptop),
broadcast enough emissions that its video would show up on my parents' TV
when used 2-4 meters away.  The video sync wasn't right, so there were
several hard-to-read images of the screen on the TV, but it was obviously
emitting enough that a properly tuned receiver could read it.
On the other hand, it doesn't bother my TV from 8-10 meters away,
but I've got cable, while my parents use Real Rabbit-Ear Antennas and some kind of antenna-booster widget.
I have heard that passive-matrix emits less, but I don't know
if that's true from a TEMPEST standpoint or only noise output.
It is a bit easier to put a laptop into an RF-shielded enclosure,
but enclosures that worked fine for harmonics of 4.77 MHz machines
don't necessarily block harmonics of 477 MHz machines :-)
especially critical are the penetrations used to get air and
fiber-optic connections through, which are basically waveguides -
once the wavelength of the signal is short enough, they lose.
* AT&T Globalyst 250P, which is a NEC Versa Pentium-75 with a Death-Star
painted on it.  It has the expensive active-matrix 24-bit-color 640x480
screen (sigh - I'd rather have had the cheaper 800x600 8-bit-color :-).
A couple years old, and the case was a bit dented so perhaps it had been more radio-tight when it was new.

Yup.  It's really annoying to have to give the California DMV lots of

@_subject: What's the latest in factoring? 
There are two countervailing arguments about very long keys;
one is that if you understand cryptography well enough to evaluate the issue, you'll know you don't need to bother,
but the other is that if you don't understand crypto very well,
maybe you should be overly conservative.
Remember that factoring difficulty is roughly exponential;
adding logn bits about doubles the cracking workload (depending on which factoring method is being used).  Factoring a 1024-bit number is _much_ harder than factoring a 512-bit
number, and factoring a 2048-bit number is well into age-of-the-universe difficulty level.  The practical level of factoring right now
is about 512 bits, for either a distributed internet effort or
an NSA internal one; in the unlikely event that Moore's law lets
us double processing power 100 times in the next 150 years,
that means a 1500-bit key could be crackable.  So 2048 bits
is certainly more than enough for _your_ lifetime.
Increasing processing power 2**100 times is likely to be tough :-)
After all, features in current microprocessors are on the order
of 100 atoms wide.  And by the time we've developed the level of nanotechnology needed to speed up processing that much,
there'll be tiny audio bugs listening to you type your passphrase
into your keyboard and reporting it back to the Central Intelligence
Corporation, or picking up the electromagnetic fields from your
direct neural interface, so the crypto strength won't matter much.
But do you really _need_ to factor the prime number to crack PGP?  No.
Remember that PGP uses the RSA key to encrypt session keys for IDEA,
or for signing MD5 hashes of documents, rather than using it directly.
So you can decrypt the message by cracking IDEA, or forge a message
by finding MD5 collisions.  Cracking IDEA's 128-bit keys was estimated
to be about as hard as factoring a 3100-bit number, though improvements
to factoring technology may make a 4096-bit number as easy as IDEA.
Also, PGP 2.x passphrases are encrypted with IDEA, so if they've
got your secring.pgp and can crack 4096-bit keys, you're toast,
even if your passphase isn't just your dog's name spelled backwards.
Similarly, by the time processing power doubles 100 times making your
1500-bit key insecure, MD5 will be long toasted.  Either way,
there's no need to go beyond 4096-bit keys ever, with old-style PGP.
Even if you're being overly conservative, that's more than enough.
Newer versions of PGP dump RSA and IDEA for patent reasons, but they also offer alternatives to IDEA and MD5 which may be stronger.
(SHA-1 is stronger than MD5, triple-DES requires immense amounts of
storage to reduce it to a strength similar to IDEA, and just being
extensible means you can replace algorithms that are obsolete.)
The other side of practical is how much work it takes to use long keys,
and how many people who want to talk to you use them.
The answer to the latter is "Not many" for RSA keys over 2048.
The former is about N**2 for decryption and N**3 for key generation,
and about linear for encryption with short exponents,
so it'll take you 64 times as long (once) to generate the key,
and 16 times as long to decrypt or sign anything, compared to
the far-more-than-strong-enough 2048-bit key, which is already
4 times as hard to use and 8 times as hard to generate as a 1024.
It's not worth the bother, unless you know have a really, really special application that needs to remain secret until long after
you've overthrown the government.  On the other hand,
at least the RSA patent will have expired by then :-)
The Diffie-Hellman implementations in PGP 5.x will let you use
key lengths up to 4096, but the speed behaviour is a bit different.
In particular, key generation is much faster, so generating
overkill-length keys isn't as boring.

CA has occasionally demanded citizenship papers to get a driver's license,
because a few politicians want to harass the large numbers of Mexicans who live here without papers.  They weren't demanding them when I got my
license 4 years ago, because they'd just been hassled in court,
and this time when I renewed the clerk said the main reason the state
mails licenses centrally instead of just printing them at the DMV
is so they can check all the data with the INS.
If you're driving a car here with Sonora plates and you've got a
Mexican license with a Sonora address, the CA cops can't bust you
for it, though they can ask stuff like what you're doing here.
But if you're parking the car on the street for more than 2 months
(it may be 1 month?) with Sonora plates, they can bust you for
not having California plates, even though you can't get them,
and for not having a California license, even though you can't get one.
Just as they can for still having Jersey plates on your car.

Sounds like an obvious target for activism to add a requirement that
any censorware systems selected be clearly identified to the public,

made available to the parents and adult library users.
In particular, many local jurisdictions have sunshine laws that
might have applicability, and anything so blatantly Un-American and dangerous as third-party censorship certainly needs to be watched.
On the legal side, the idea of a Federal mandate that state and local
jurisdictions make decisions that cannot be reviewed by the Feds
seems pretty dodgy; certainly the whole issue ought to be reviewable
by courts in response to a citizen lawsuit, even if Federal prosecutors
can't initiate actions about it.

A minor correction - while the CIA wanted to overthrow Mossadegh,
they screwed up, and had very little part in actually doing it.
The British were the main instigators of the coup, which had a fair amount of popular support, and which went fast enough that the
CIA was caught by surprise - they hadn't even spent a tenth of their
bribery slush fund yet.  So why does everybody keep saying that the CIA put the Shah in power?
Because in the early 60s, trying to repair their reputation after the
Bay Of Pigs fiasco, the CIA put out a lot of PR taking credit for it,
and since it was the kind of thing they would have done if they hadn't missed the starting gun, people pretty much believed them.
And a lot of Iranians have been blaming them for it ever since.
[References:  Some book I read a while back.  Don't remember the

had his own axe to grind; certainly the CIA had their cloak and dagger

Unfortunately, there's a conflict between real definitions of spam
(you knew it when you sent it, and the recipients knew it too)
and the real-world problems encountered with blocking/canceling spam,
which tends to result in either censorship or under-blocking.
Number of recipients _isn't_ the right criterion at all -
but it's objective enough to agree on, and usually makes a
clear enough boundary between most spammers and most non-spammers.
Rigidly defining numerical limits can also have serious problems,
because there are good messages that get excluded.
The more important number is the number of people deciding
which things are and are not spam - "More than 1" is best,
while "There can be only one" is censorship, either deliberate
or as a side-effect.

That's fine - people who take this approach may get less mail
from interesting people as well as getting less mail from spammers.
It's easy to find mail forwarding systems that don't cost much
and will filter out well-known spam, either for free or for a small fee.
Pobox.com offers this, and I think the iname.com systems do also;
I don't know about hotmail and other web-based mailreaders.
Most of us have flat-rate email, and the important cost is our attention span, not the transmission cost.  For other people,
that's not true, and sending them junk mail _is_ ripping them off
financially as well as ripping off their time and concentration.
As far as "how do you know something is bulk mail"?  The sender knows,
and the sender is the one being rude to thousands of receivers
if it is bulk mail.
This does not apply in countries that still have
Government-granted Monopoly Postal/Telephone/Telegraph companies.
It also doesn't apply in places where the Telephone Company
decides to charge for connect time by the minute rather than
flat rate - even if your internet provider is flat rate,
you may be paying 1-5 cents/minute - mildly annoying on a US salary, and much more so on a Polish salary.
And in a free market, you'd expect a mix of options,
since different people have different net connection needs,
financial constraints, and communications costs.
My main ISP offers an 800 number for about 10 cents/minute,
and I sometimes use it when I'm on the road at hotels with

Good article.  If you're trying to emphasize the financial stuff, moving it up to the beginning would help, but I don't know the audience you wrote it for.  A few nitpicks:
_Bell_ Labs, and BTW they developed one of the first 8-bit microprocessors;
the MAC-8 was used for building telephone things back in late 4004 days.
However, the Electro-Mechanical telephone switch was Not Invented Here -
Strowger developed it to protect privacy and increase reliability
(he suspected that a competitor had bribed the telephone operator to
connect customers to the competitor's business instead of Strowger's.)
He offered it for sale to the Bell Telephone Companies, who were too
clueless to see the economics and buy it; they caught on a few years later,
and had to pay tons of money to the competitor who'd licensed the patent. The difficulty, of course, is that geodesic markets with bearer instruments make it easy to do business anonymously - so everyone
may know that fraud was committed, but not know who committed it.
(Like the US political excuse "Mistakes were made".)
The lack of need for accounts and reputation capital is part of what
makes geodesic markets financially advantageous.  On the other hand,
reconciling these differences is complex enough that cryptographers
and financial folks can make big bucks getting it right :-)

@_subject: I was auto-outed by an IMG tag in HTML spam 
HTML is a fine format for email.  It's ASCII readable, and supports
content description tags that the user's mail reader can render as
bold/italic/underline/header-levels//color/etc.  It's far superior
to using bloated undocumented Microsoft Word attachments.
95% of the HTML email I get IS spam, but that's a separate problem :-)
(After all, SPAMMERs like bright colored blinking attention-getting mail.)
Doesn't even need a prompt - a basic missing-picture icon is fine,
with a load-images command somewhere.  While it's not as dangerous as
auto-processing, autodownloading is annoying, and can be both a
security risk (the auto-outing problem) and a denial-of-service risk.
Needs to be either off by default or not there at all.
Netscape mail is adequate for many people, just as Eudora is.
Newer versions are pretty bloated, but including S/MIME mail encryption
for everybody is a Good Thing.

@_subject: putting down the US military 
Sorry to hear about your friend, and I'm glad your son got back.
A friend of mine lives in Somalia about half the time,
except when his wife's tribe's over in Ethiopia.  They've been through
years of civil war, in a society that until the colonialists
took over was extremely free and relatively peaceful (for a bunch of semi-nomadic cattle herders armed to the teeth like pre-industrial Swiss;
they tend to have occasional short armed squabbles when the
normal social structures for peacefully resolving differences fail)
and the wars for control of the post-colonial government have
made it impossible for their economy to do well during drought.
Michael's friends were quite pleased at kicking the UN's butts,
and at kicking the US Army's butts, but they thought that even
if there hadn't been a civil war going on, the idea of trying to disarm Somalis is blatantly foolish - you'd have better luck
trying to disarm an NRA convention, where people carry guns for fun
rather than to protect their families and livestock like Somalis.
After all, most NRA members believe in Nations and Governments;
Somalis believe in their families and tribes and the Law,
and any "leader" who expects blind obedience from his followers
quickly finds out that nobody's following him.
Sending US soldiers in to do a fool's errand like that should
offend you even more.   And telling a free people that they should
give up the guns they protect their families with because
the UN will take care of protecting them is an offense to them.

The Stinger missile and the bazooka have been a good start, letting local defenders stop the expensive tools of attacking armies.
Following stupid orders gets your fellow soldiers killed stupidly.
Following immoral orders gets your fellow soldiers killed, and gets the opposing soldiers killed, and gets the civilian collateral damage killed,
and the fact that you're following orders doesn't absolve you of guilt.
Once you're in the war, you're also fighting to keep your buddies from
getting killed, and to keep from getting killed yourself, and if the
orders are tactically correct and sacrifice you and your buddies as
the price of an overall victory, that's the price of being a soldier.
But if you shouldn't be there, you shouldn't be there, no matter how
competent and brave and patriotic you're being while you're there.
Most soldiers I've known believe in following orders, and the politicians
who send them there pull out all the stops to keep them believing it.
Yeah?  In 1980, Iraq attacked Iran, and the US sold them weapons,
and Saddam was Reagan & Bush's good buddy and ally.  And in 1990
when Saddam was talking with the US Ambassador about their border problem,
she said the US had no interest in such a purely local problem.
OK, it wasn't like we had to twist Saddam's arm to get him to invade;
he is a militarist asshole - but in 1980 that was a Good Thing.
And in 19{pick a number} Israel invaded South Lebanon - Good Thing Too!
Is it possible that it's got a lot more to do with US Foreign policy
or geopolitical interests?  Or about the fact that the US Military-
Industrial Complex was severely threatened by the lack of Commies?
Or just partly because George Bush's Neilsen ratings were down
and he'd had good results invading Panama?  Or that the Ayatollah
had gotten rid of one of America's favorite dictators in Iran
just a year or two before (even though he disliked Commies too)?
Or because the US Army wanted to make sure everybody knows that
they can kick anybody's ass, anywhere, anytime?
In the process of demolishing Iraq, Bush's army killed hundreds of
thousands of civilians, demolishing much of the civilian infrastructure
for safe drinking water (which probably killed more people than
the bombing did), as well as killing tens of thousands of
draftee soldiers.  If the objective had been to get rid of Saddam,
a couple dozen good Mossad agents or Green Berets could have
taken him out quickly and efficiently.  That wasn't the objective.
He's a sleaze, but no moron - his objectives are maintaining his own
political influence, which he's very good at, as opposed to doing
anything positive for the Kuwaitis or Iraqis or Americans....
Probably about like what they did to the Iranians or what the
Israelis did to the South Lebanese, except that it was Bad instead of Good.
I agree.  And telling the government to stop initiating wars and trying
to get the people not to jump in line behind a propaganda bandwagon
are a good part of trying to be a better people.

Yeah.  Netcom doesn't have the right to decide what I'm allowed to read,
but it can decide what materials that it will transmit, if it wants,
and I can decide whether to do business with them, if I want.
Two of the ISPs I use for receiving email offer spam-filtering services;
I'm not currently buying either of them, but if spam goes from
5% to 50% of my mail, I'll certainly consider it.
(And one of them gives a summary of what it's blocked, which is good.)
Ray Arachelian and Eric Blossom can't decide what messages on Cypherpunks I'm allowed to read, but they can offer the most interesting 5-10%
and maybe I'll use their editing capabilities instead of reading the
whole firehose myself.  (I alternate between FCPUNX and the full list.)
Corporations aren't a necessity, just a convenience; the big
law firms and accounting firms are all partnerships, and do just fine
without being corporations.  Corporations do have artificial rights,
but as constructs of the state, the state can decide which rights to
give them and which rights not to give them in return for the favor
of granting corporate charters.
But Jim should know better than to say that businesses don't have rights.
Businesses are activities that people engage in, either as individual
proprietors, or as contractors, or as partnerships, or as employees,
or as corporations.  One of my ISPs is a sole proprietor, though he's
now got an employee or two.  Doesn't diminish his rights any.
Another of my ISPs is a corporation; they're big and clumsy,
but I can still hire them to perform services for me, including
editing if I want to.
Nonsense - there's far more stuff written every day than you or I
have time to read; even on Usenet, I had to stop reading every
newsgroup sometime around 1984 (a few years before Henry Spencer stopped :-)
Depending on other people to find interesting stuff is necessary;
the question is how you pick your sources and filters,
and how much you trust them to tell you everything.
Of course they're not - do you think anybody actually believes everything they read or see on TV (well, yeah, there seem to be people who do :-)
If you want to be well-informed, you need lots of sources;
one of the cool things about the net is that you _can_ get
lots of information that seldom got through the official channels
before.  Some of it didn't get through because it didn't match
the political biases of the editors or newspaper corporate owners;
other stuff didn't get through because it was boring or bogus,
and if you're filtering all the news yourself, you'll need to
do your own guessing and fact-checking.

he's also close enough to crazy that the public will have
enough sympathy for him that killing him won't be highly popular,
especially because his brother wouldn't have turned him in
if he'd expected him to be killed.
Also, while his killings have been somewhat scary and weird,
they haven't generated the kind of public outrage that the

@_subject: PGP-out-only vs. hashcash aware remailers? 
Hashcash won't help mail2news, except by discouraging dumb spammers,
because news spam only needs a few messages.
PGP-only input will cut down on most spammers, though you'll still get a few, especially if they're spamming mailing lists (which makes the encryption both worth the effort and useful for safety.)
If you modify your remailer to only _output_ PGP-encrypted messages,
you get hashcash-equivalence, and cut abuse substantially.
The cost is limiting recipients to pgp users (plus known exceptions),
but it's tough to spam people when you need to look up their PGP key
and encrypt to it (at least you'll only get spams for high-tech stuff),
and it's tougher for random abusers to abuse people since most targets
don't have PGP keys, and a mailbox full of PGP junk is less annoying
to most people than a mailbox full of human-readable hate mail.
In particular, it's harder to send death threats to politicians
if they don't have published PGP keys.
Is this a feature that makes sense?
PGP-out-only remailers aren't as useful for anonymous tip lines
(unless the tip line has a PGP address.)  They're not as useful for inviting new people into your conspiracy, though they're fine for conspiring with people whose keys you already know (and they can be unlisted keys only used for the conspiracy.)
If the Bank of Caribbean Cash Importers is interested in taking
anonymous clients who contact them through remailers, they've probably got a PGP key handy to send to anyway.
They're not transparently useful for mail2news, but the remailer
could make exceptions for known mail2news sites, or could ignore
the problem, which is fine for posting to alt.anonymous.messages,
though not for posting to alt.whistleblowers.
How would you implement it?
Obviously you'd need to allow some unencrypted lines at the beginning,
at least if they have remailer syntax( ::,  mail headers, etc.).
Do you cut all lines after the "-----END PGP"?  My first impression was
yes, but after reading the Freedom Remailer source, it looks like
this might kill messages using encrypted reply blocks, so maybe not.
Detecting the PGP itself can be crude ("----- BEGIN PGP ENCRYPTED"...)
or can be a bit fancier (make sure the lines are all the right length
and limited to the correct character set), or much fancier (de-armor and look for PGP blocks).
Even the fancy approaches can be spoofed, since you can't go very
deep into the headers without the right keys, so a couple lines of
real PGP material could be included, leaving possibilities like
But at least it's a start.

@_subject: Location Escrow anyone ? 
Tracking your position in real time is one thing - recording the tracks
is quite another.    The system does need to know, in real time,
the cell for each phone that's currently talking,
and needs to know quickly where any phone that's being called is
(could be implemented either by constantly tracking every phone,
or by sending out requests when the call is made,
probably starting with the usual suspect locations and then
branching out farther, or using some kind of roaming notification.)
But does it need to know where you've been?  It wouldn't be surprising
if the telco recorded location (at least cell site) at the beginning
of each call, to resolve billing disputes with customers,
and of course they record minutes of use and roaming information
for users who make calls outside their home territory.
They probably also record calls per cell site and handoff information,
but probably not by user.
For police purposes, if you want to find somebody right now,
and the cellphone system can only give you precise locations right now,
just call them - "Hey, Suspect!  We know where you are,
and it's costing you money for us to call you and tell you!
Have a nice day!" - and the system knows even if they don't answer.
They could probably deliver it on industry-standard 9-track tape :-)
5 bytes is enough to locate you within 62m anywhere on Earth
- 16 bits gets you 1km of lat or long on a 40000km planet),
though 4 bytes is probably enough to identify a cell plus
some precision bits since the whole planet doesn't have cell sites.
So it's really only 20-25MB of data per user to track that much data,
and it compresses extremely well (e.g. 1 byte/sample is plenty for
phones that are moving, and run-length coding radically reduces the
location of the phones that aren't moving, which probably
covers 23 hours a day for most people.)  Call it 250KB/day, max?
I'd be surprised if they really kept that much, and the economics are bad,
but they could do it, and they'll be much happier to mail you a floppy
of compressed data for your 300 francs, or print it in very tiny print...

@_subject: Theory Behind USA v. Microsoft 
Two other examples - - Rockefeller's takeover of the oil industry in the late 1800s
- the Anti-Trust laws that were intended to stop Rockefeller :-)
Apparently a large part of Rockefeller's success was recognizing the
critical resource in the industry and using control of it for
economic advantage.  The resource was railroad oil tank cars,
which were immensely more economical for shipping oil than the
competing technologies - transportation costs were substantial.
Rockefeller cornered the market for them, using them to ship oil
cheaper than other shippers, allowing his refineries to outbid
competitors for crude oil from suppliers, cornering enough of that
market to have a dominant position with the railroads,
which didn't have an economic motivation to buy their own tank cars,
and the tank car makers didn't have an incentive to make them on spec,
especially with Rockefeller twisting their arms.
The total amount of actual capital was pretty small - about 5000-6000 cars at $1000 each, back when that was still real money,
but it was enough to leverage the industry.  There were other factors
involved - his control over the tank cars let him get away with
ripping off his oil suppliers and the railroads on measurements of
the quantities they were shipping, much corporate shuffling
to hide the real ownership of the resources and evade regulators,
kickbacks to avoid common carrier railroad tariffs,
and heavy use of information technology (5000 cars only needed a
couple of clerks with ledgers, but there were lots of people telegraphing shipping data back to them so it was near-real-time.)
If the industry had been well-understood, rather than breaking up
a billion-dollar business, the anti-trust folks could have subsidized (directly or through tax breaks) competing production of tank cars.
They did try to control ownership of tank cars, so Rockefeller spun off
the tank car company, but retained effective control for decades.
Their choices have set us up for a century of bad law....

3 - Potential investors (including you) can make money
Three obvious business models for you and your investors are
2a - Operate the service yourself, hiring people or renting space
2b - Sell/license the software to commercial providers
2c - Freeware, perhaps with some way for you to get advertising revenue
Which combinations of these options can achieve wide usage depends
a lot on your models of users of the system; some of those models
are moneymakers, some aren't, some are safe, some are dangerous,
and some just attract a sleazy clientele.  Here are a few models

Did most of that work rate as "immoral science" - I'd say so.
Now, some of it has uses outside the torture business,
but the primary customer of the work on freezing was the
nuclear bomber forces of some of the larger evil empires,
which wanted to know how much risk they could take
destroying their competitors' motherlands.  Sure, part of the goal
is to protect their employees, but even that is primarily to
increase their ability to destroy their enemies' civilians,
which is pretty morally dicey even if your enemy is evil.
A few users like oil companies have workers in the Arctic, and most moral organizations are more concerned about preventing accidents and minimizing risks to workers than getting away with
as much damage to their workers as they can; there are still
some legitimate uses of the knowledge like how to do medical
care for freezing-related accident victims, or extreme situations
like nuclear power-plant disaster cleanup.  But not a lot.

@_subject: Spam 
There's some interesting technical work being done at maps.vix.com,
by Paul Vixie and friends.  They've got a Realtime Blackhole List
server which kills any email coming from any site they know that
permits third-party smtp relays.  They're a bit on the aggressive side
(their current implementation doesn't provide a convenient
local override list, so if you install their system in your
sendmail.cf, you lose email from anybody they block until
_they_ decide the site has rehabilitated itself.)
I learned about them the hard way (they blackhole ix.netcom.com,
so my mail to the pgp-users list now gets rejected.  Sigh.)
Their web page says they'd rather throw out a few extra babies
to get rid of all this excess bathwater.  After all, they're not just killing spam, they're killing all mail
you receive from any system that's easy to spam through,
whether it's spam or not.
Getting rid of third-party relays is a good start, and you don't
need to get rid of _all_ of them to make spamming much harder;
if you convince most of the big internet services to turn them off,
you force the spammers to go searching for relays, which is not
only more work, but if there are a number of trap systems waiting
for them they may get caught.
Losing third-party relay is rather a shame - the Internet used to
be a cooperative system where everybody tried to get mail through,
and avoiding third-party relay is more complex if your users
have lots of different domain names (e.g.  hosted at
bigisp.net).  It also pushes the net more in the direction of
all mail needing to have True Names, which is a Bad Thing,
and decreases robustness of the overall system.  Personally,
I've found it more trouble now that my employer doesn't do
third-party relay, since I need different configurations for
Eudora and Netscape Mail depending on whether my laptop is on the LAN at work or dialed into my ISP from home (Win95 IP appears to be too dumb to let me configure a hosts file that points "mailhost" to the appropriate IP address,
and Netscape seems to keep all its options in the Registry
rather than accepting command-line options like Eudora does.)
Another approach to reducing spam is of course to keep contacting
ISPs to kill off bad users, and to get ISPs to refuse spamhauses
as customers.

Jim -
you and I are political theorists, and you're asking a political question,
though I'm not sure what kind of question you mean.
Froomkin's a law professor, though he's also got political opinions.
To a lawyer, the answer is that the Constitution ultimately means
whatever you can talk the Supreme Court into saying it means,
or whatever you or your opponents can talk a lower court into saying if the court's opinion is strong enough that the loser decides
it's not worth spending the resources to appeal, and the Supreme Court
has decided all sorts of things over the years depending on
the political climate.   Many legal and political theorists have
opinions about Marbury vs. Madison and the other cases in which the
Supreme Court decided that the Constitution said they're the ones
who get to decide what the Constitution means; you may have opinions
about that, or you could be asking Froomkin what he thinks about it.
On the other hand, the Constitution is a political compromise
between a bunch of long-dead politicians, in which they offered the
public a deal that they'd mostly stick within its limits
if they agreed not to ignore or overthrow them.  So you could be asking
if he thinks it's a good compromise, or you could be asking if
he's a Loyal American who agrees not to overthrow or ignore the
Constitution (as opposed to one of them pinko Commies),
or you could be asking if he's a Loyal American who believes the
Government isn't sticking to their end of the bargain and
therefore deserves to be overthrown.  Or you could be asking a
Lysander Spooner question about whether he thinks a bunch of
promises made by a bunch of long-dead politicians have any
authority over either the politicians or the people today.
So which question are you asking, and why?

@_subject: Covert Superhighway - the missing component? 
Usenet is useful for this because flood routing works well,
and because millions of people send hundreds of megabytes a day
of cover traffic, and tens or hundreds of thousands of machines
are connected to it, so any individual machine connecting or
retrieving traffic from it is not suspicious.  It's also useful
because forgery is easy and tracing is tedious, and because there's
no central control in spite of the occasional cabals.
If we build a sub-usenet to carry our traffic, it's easy to
build good flood routing (and most of the tools can be reused),
but it isn't easy to get millions of users and thousands
of machines of cover traffic to piggyback on unless you
either create something new and really cool, or unless you
find something already cool, decentralized, and loud
to piggyback on that doesn't make your traffic noticeable.
Some directions to look:
- Stego inside Voice-over-IP - (Ron Rivest's suggestion)
This can either work because yet another phone call isn't
very suspicious, though traffic analysis is a possibility,
or you can develop the Killer Voice App for the Masses
which does store&forward of its own bits without telling them.
- IRC is one possibility, though I don't know how big it is.
- CU-SeeMe reflectors are fun, and you can stego a lot of traffic
inside your pictures.
- Ship Anonymizers with every copy of Apache (or Apache-SSL),
which is the most popular web server in the net.
- Webcam Stego for webcams with high-entropy changing pictures,
e.g. cloudy skies or oceans rather than mostly-static coffeepots.
Adam Back's idea of piggybacking on gaming nets could be among the more interesting approaches, at least for games
that don't have a central control system.
In general, I'd guess that the limits of stego are that
you can't really hide more than about 10% contraband
inside your cover material, and for some methods it's a
lot less.  If you assume the typical user has a 28.8 line,
you can get maybe the equivalent of 2400 bps of real traffic.
Fine for banking; a bit rough for selling lots of large images,
too slow for live speech.

This isn't really the list for that sort of thing.
While Rand is partially correct, the big industrialization of the US
came from the railroad business opening the West, which depended
on killing off the Indians who lived there - in large part by
wiping out the buffalo herds and starving the people,
and by using the US Army to kill them, and granting large
chunks of the land to the railroads, not only enough right of
way for tracks, but typically several miles on each side.
Here in Northern California, the Gold Rush was simplified by
killing off the local tribes in gold country.
And much of the early industrialization in New England was
cotton mills, processing slave-grown cotton.

There are different degrees of UnConstitutionalness.  Some things are so
blatantly off the edge that even if Congress passed them, they'd be laughed
out of the first court that addressed them, like banning plant-growing
or discrete mathematics or arresting everybody with Japanese ancestors.
Others are much grayer areas, where court cases addressing them would take a long time and cost a lot of money, which can be prohibitively
expensive for the early phases of research.
At least for the US, the important issue is that Congress hasn't passed any laws, nor do they need to - this is a speechmaking opp for Clinton,
and maybe for a few right-wing or left-wing Congresscritters,
so they can all sound concerned about this scary new technology,
and so the public will remember that they feel our pain.
A much more realistic, and Constitutional, possibility is that the Feds
will ban use of Federal money for cloning research.  As a civil
libertarian, I think that's just fine, and they should do the same
to other controversial research, like nuclear weapons and fetal parts,
for which significant fractions of the public don't want to be forced
to fund those activities they believe to be immoral or dangerous.
Alternatively, [Note: End of serious section] they could use the
confiscatory tax model pioneered with the machine gun and marihuana bans -
the tax on cloning body parts is an arm and a leg, but if you
clone an entire human it'll cost you your firstborn child...

Actually, to continue twisttied analogies,
MS is a maker of those plastic 6-pack-holder straps, and has recently discovered that beer is an important market (!) and added canned beer to their list of things they can hold (along with MS NewCoke, MS OEM-Cola.RC, MS Canned OJ, MS Canned News,
and MSBeans.)
Netscape, a maker of bottled beer (available singly, in cases, or in cardboard sixpack holders), wants the Feds to stop
Microsoft from selling their plastic straps integrated with beer.
All of us old geezers who remember drinking Home Brewed Real Beer
and the younger hackers who were exposed to beer from kegs in college
   (even if they buy canned Rolling Rock at home because it's cheap)  have been telling people for years that canning beer is a Bad Thing
and that Microsoft wouldn't know beer if it bit them on the wallet.
Bottles aren't a bad way to store beer, if you must sell it packaged,
though Netscape's got a lot of gall complaining that MS makes dealers
of MSBeerCans and MSBeerCanRings sell MSBeer along with them,
seeing as how Netscape got their start giving away free beer
in paper cups using the Computer Science Department Recreation Fund,
and got the idea for Beer from those Europeans anyway, even if they did
add the innovation of selling it in cheap one-drink-sized containers....

@_subject: (eternity) Eternity as a secure filesystem/backup medium (fwd) 
Assume the existence of a for-profit service provider.
The service provider needs to cover the costs of the service,
plus enough profit to make the effort interesting.
The prices charged need to reflect the costs (or be higher)
or the service provider can't make money and goes out of business.
So what are the costs, and who can be talked into paying for them?
1) Storage of information - Storage currently costs < $1/MB for raw disk, and getting cheaper by the minute, but sysadmins, lawyers, etc.
cost money and they're not getting cheaper as fast.
The costs of the equipment for permanent storage are probably about
10-50% more than the costs for storing for 5 years;
the costs of administration (assuming inflation is limited to
some small number) can be covered by an annuity.
Every technology upgrade or two you need to copy the archives to new storage media, and data that doesn't get accessed often may
get migrated out to slower or perhaps even offline media;
storage contracts need to reflect that retrieving data that hasn't
been accessed in a while may involve some delay.
2) Transmission of information - Roughly proportional to MB/time -
unlike storage, this one's not predictable, unless the provider and
author agree in advance (e.g. N free accesses per year, per password.)
So the provider could charge the reader for access, or use advertising
banners to fund retrieval costs (if that remains a valid model
for financing the web over the next N years, especially if the
readers retrieve data through anonymizers.)
3) Legal defense - This one's harder to predict :-)  The current US climate is that service providers are relatively immune as long as they cooperate with subpoenas and court orders,
discourage copyright violators, and avoid having legal knowledge of
the contents of their sites, but that could change.
If they want their names known, they can include them in the contents
of the data that readers retrieve, independent of what the server does.
(Of course, they can forge other peoples' names as well :-)
And they can use pseudonyms, with or without digital signatures,
and accumulate reputation capital under those nyms.
If they want to collect money from the readers, that's independent -
they may be able to include advertising, or may sell the decryption
keys to the data for digicash or information using some contact mechanism,
or they may just be publishing their manifestos for The True Cause.

But it can be, and the costs of doing so aren't much higher than
storing it for the first couple of years.  Depends on what service
the customer wants to buy.  And there are applications that
require more than 100 years of data protection, e.g. ownership
of copyrights which last 50 years beyond the author's death.
But for Matt Barrie's question, any permanent document will do.
Hard to say.  Assuming that Quantum Cryptography doesn't allow
finite-sized computers to do large exponentially complex calculations
in short finite time, you're probably limited by the number of atoms
in the available supply of planets, and Heisenberg may still get you
if that's not a low enough limit.  Moore's law isn't forever.
But there's no particular reason to limit RC4 or RC5 to 128 bits;
those are convenient sizes for MD5 hashes of passphrases.
So if you're paranoid, use RC4-256 and superencrypt with 5-DES.

Long since solved - use NTP.  Assuming the nodes don't need to be

they should clock off some trusted worldwide internet providers.
If they need to be blazingly invisible, use a GPS receiver clock.
(Using NTP with each other makes it easy to estimate distances,
but that's a risk any time you've got uniform clocking and
reasonably fast-turnaround communication.)
You've described the Node as a "clearing corporation", with bonding
to cover liability.  The corporation and central authority both work
against your goal of "a) independent of borders and national laws."
Also, assuming that each Node posts bonds in about the same amount
as it accepts bonds posted with it, the bonds still don't provide
an incentive not to abscond with the money, since it steals about
as much as it forfeits in bond; expected positive future cash flow is what discourages the Node from absconding.  Posting bonds with
a central authority avoids this problem, but a central authority
is both a target for governments and for freelance thieves,
and a temptation for its operators to abscond.
That's a job for careful implementation; you don't want customers
taking down nodes either.
You didn't address a major problem:
0) Scalability
Talking to 10 other nodes in realtime is easy.  10000 is hard.
Not only do you need the bandwidth, but you've got to worry about
nodes that are down, or that you temporarily can't communicate with,
and you've got to be fast enough to respond to all their demand,
maintain state for your crypto sessions with them, recover from
your own outages, and deal with the queuing if they've all decided
that you've got the best price for something this second.
The more nodes you talk to, the harder it is to scale.
But the fewer nodes you talk to directly, the slower it is to
propagate information about prices, bids, and offers, and therefore
the harder it is to get prices to converge - since you discuss
eliminating arbitrage, bid-ask spreads, and expensive intermediaries,
this is a problem.  Also, assuming the system has convenient room
for negotiation, you'll still have time delays as people are deciding
what to do, so there's still arbitrage to be made, and depending
on your liability structure, there's probably room for low-balling
and high-balling on bids.

Obviously you can't compress the keys themselves, and if you just take
a short chunk of each key, you don't have enough entropy to be useful.
But you can make a file with all the keys, hash the file, and post
the hash and an URL for the file.  That lets you use 128 or 160 bits
of hash.  That's plenty of room, and has full-strength security.
If you want to do a 32-character message, it's tighter;
using the usual 6-bit characters, 128 bits of hash takes 22 chars,
and 160 bits takes 27.  If you use the btoa encoding, which puts
4 bytes of binary into 5 bytes of ascii (if the 85 characters
it uses can all be printed in the NYT's fonts), that's
20 for 128 or 25 for 160.  So you have up to 12 characters left.
So how short a URL can you do?  With some cooperation from Vince, you can probably do 2 characters - "ai", which should retrieve  (currently  does.).  I don't know if
Netscape will let you retrieve this - I tried it, and got the index page for  using the Netscape "try adding .com" hack.
(If you use the hack, "a" is shorter, but you'll need to
give the IANA a good excuse for using the a.com reserved name.
And keys.com is a company in the Florida Keys, but maybe they'd
be friendly.)  The shortest URL that really looks like an URL
is probably  .
If the NYT insists on a phone number, that's 10-11 characters,
so you'll need a shorter hash :-)  Is 64 bits enough?  It's
long enough that it's hard to brute-force, and you probably
don't need to worry about birthday attacks, though it's
still uncomfortably short. Bill Stewart, bill.stewart at pobox.com

You missed my point - the cost of a CPU-year and GB-year drop rapidly
every year; the costs of storage plus associated CPU for 100 years of storage are probably just a bit higher than for 5 years.
For normal businesses, that's true, but eternity servers, if they can
be physically located, probably will require a bit more lawyery.
You're probably right, though you may not need 7x24 sysadmins,
and they can share their time maintaining quite a lot of servers if
they're all cookie-cutter.
Somewhere between 10:1 and 100:1; the cost of sysadmins making tapes
may be higher than the media itself :-)
The price of pipes is very roughly proportional to their size.
The size of the pipes you need are roughly proportional to how much
data gets transmitted during your busy hour.  This gets cheaper
every year as well, but nowhere near as fast, and the volume
depends on how interesting the data is to potential readers
as well as on how big it is.  There are different models for how to run an Eternity server,
but any server will need bandwidth based on how much is getting retrieved.
In any case, the machine transmitting data knows which request
it's responding to, even if it doesn't really know who the
requester or the author are, so it's not unreasonable to charge
a retrieval fee or stick on an advertising banner.
You might want to give away that THC recipe for free just to end
the drug war, or to make supplies cheap and plentiful, or because
it's a bogus recipe using your own special brand of yeast.  It's the principle of the thing :-)  On the other hand,
if the provider of the service deliberately doesn't know what
the documents on the system are, to him it's just shipping bits,
and content is Somebody Else's Problem.
I'm not talking about how to get users - I'm talking about those
annoying banners from Doubleclick and LinkExchange that fund many
of the interesting services on the net because advertisers think
it's worth their money to buy impressions.
The assumption is that True Names and physical locations are probably
anonymous.  Doesn't mean that a reader is going to retrieve documents
of unknown content by unknown authors - you may very well know that
Zed WareMeister has the best deal on slightly-used Microsoft Products
and can be found on alt.eternity.warez, and his reputation capital accumulates under the pseudonym rather than his True Name.
But there will also be authors whose names are well-known but whose locations aren't - Salmon Rushdie may be selling digitally signed copies of his latest book online, but he still doesn't want to be easy to find.

@_subject: On the LAM--Local Area Mixes 
Wiring houses/business/etc. together simply for the purpose of mixes
is difficult enough that it won't happen enough to be significant.
On the other hand, cable modems keep claiming that they'll be widely
deployed Real Soon Now, and at least some of the cable modem versions
seem to support communications between users on the same cable or
same chunk of the cable network, and may provide a useful medium,
especially if broadcasts/multicasts are available.  On a smaller scale,
there are increasing numbers of office buildings that come with
internet access, and the occasional Palo Alto apartment building is
cooperatively wired.
We've certainly seen that in the Drug Wars, with no-knock searches
and similar attacks.  On the other hand, use of search warrants in the US
has always been honored more in the breach than the observance -
the year before the Supreme Court issued the Exclusionary Rule,
the New York City police didn't bother getting any search warrants,
because the Constitutional requirement that they do so didn't have
any real enforcement mechanism.
However, LAMs and similar technology have the value that the police
may not notice all the users in a cluster, especially passive lurkers,
and the disappearance of multiple nodes allows the non-seized systems
to get their data out to another data haven and clean up. Lurkers may be passive on the LAM, but forward data received from it
out to other media.  Running network protocols without ACKs takes
a bit of work to get right, but you can run the ACKs in some outside
channel to make sure you get everything; much of the work on
multicast protocols can be used to implement it.

For now, most of those services all live on machines dedicated
to the banner service, rather than on the same machine as the server.
Making machines vanish is easy - put them in your hosts file as
aliases to 127.0.0.2, and if you're behind a proxy server,
put them on your "no proxy" list.  Of course, if everybody
starts doing this, then more systems will start using ad servers
that have names in their own domain, but it works for now on
most of the major servers.  I've found that killing doubleclick.net
and linkexchange.com gets rid of most of the banners.

It's not just the government - the mass media have been scared of the
Net for a long time because it disintermediates them.  The recent flap about the Drudge Report and the lack of fact-checking and quality is a good example of that - the spin has been very negative about the dangers of uncontrolled, uncensored, unthrottled speech.
An alternative spin could be to emphasize signal-to-noise and the
far better quality of information that traditional media can provide.
While I've got some disagreements about James Donald's explanations of
Crypto Kong's model (no need for CAs, etc. vs. the simple approaches
for replicating the Web Of Trust and CAs using his tools),
once nice thing about it is that you don't use anything called a "certificate" - it just compares whether a message is signed by the
same key that a previous message was.  That previous message can be
a vanilla message, or an introductory note from someone (Alice saying
that Bob's key is 457HLJCR8YFDG7807FG7FD87G, and that this is the
Bob she met at the Peace Center fundraiser), or a note from Catbert
the HR Director saying Bob works at MegaFooBar, or a note from
BankFoo that the checks from account 23123124 need to be signed by
key 93243248329048.  While they work like key signatures, they don't
look like CA signatures, they look like ordinary correspondence.

Well, we got there and there was a note on the door
saying we had to "sign in credibly" and not freak the guards,
so some people signed in credibly and some signed incredibly.
Sameer did take down the Police Line Do Not Cross tape
and let us get at the sodas; perhaps that bribed some people :-)
We had a reasonably good crowd, and a bunch of out-of-towners
got to talk about what they were doing and work in progress.
Peter Trei did a nice rehash of his talk on the state of key cracking,
somewhat more technical than the layperson version he'd done
at the RSA show.   It keeps getting easier; 40 bits is laughable,
56 is work, but very crackable, even for RC5, and 64 bits will
take years at the current rate - he and some others would rather
see the next big distributed cracks going for RSA 512-bit keys.
Hardware has been advancing a good bit as well as distributed efforts.
The social dynamics of distributed cracking are much different than
expected - the feeling of community that teams have appears to be
more of a motivator than the prize for most people, so coordinated
efforts have been the big contributors.
The talk on export control was put off until another meeting, though Greg Broiles gave a nice short summary of what's going on.  He'd appreciate input on other people's
experience getting products through the export bureaucrats.
Hugh talked about the state of FreeS/WAN Linux IPSEC,
and also about Secure DNS, which he and John Gilmore recently
went through the paperwork of exporting, crypto source and all.
Lucky Green talked about the Smartcard activities - he and his
unindicted co-conspirators discovered that they're the only
group making public smartcard support tools that aren't controlled
by a smartcard vendor.  Check them out on cypherpunks.to.

@_subject: Why no "Banner Ad Eaters"? 
With both PICS ratings for web pages and the new TV ratings,
somehow the ratings only apply to the program and not the ads.
After all, if each TV commercial had to be separately rated,
people would rapidly develop equipment to autoblock commercials,
and that just wouldn't do.
Unfortunately, you're probably right, though providers and advertisers
who really want their messages to get through will find ways to do it.
The current banners are nice, friendly implementations in that they're
easy to identify and block; newer ones will just be sneakier.
They'll come from the same machine as the real page, or they'll
be embedded in the background images, or the servers will insist on not shipping you the pages you want until you've downloaded the banner
(e.g. by putting some of the interesting material into images.)
Sure, it requires some server rewriting, but there's money in it.
Alternatively, they may go to clickthrough payment models - the
web page owner only gets paid when people click on the ad,
though perhaps at a higher rate than current "impressions".

@_subject: How to eliminate liability? 
Secret Sharing is easy, and there are a number of implementations with
useful properties like being able to read the original from K of N parts.*
The problem is how to implement it in ways that protect the server
operators as well as the information providers.  For instance,
the author's client software can do the split and send the shares too
different servers, and make sure the readers know how to find the pieces;
this can even be automated enough to make it convenient.
This not only makes it hard for the Bad Guys to find the pieces,
it makes it impossible for the data haven provider to know what's
being stored there, and even if the site is siezed it doesn't give up
the critical information.  This is a Good Thing, and we've discussed it.
On the other hand, what happens if a Bad Guy wants to entrap the operator,
by planting child pornography, pirated software, and TOP SECRET data
in the data haven, advertising on Usenet and then calling the cops.  Anybody, including the cops, can retrieve the contraband and bust them.
So what are the alternatives, besides obviously encrypting your disks
so it's harder to determine what's on them besides the plant,
and the ever popular "don't let them find your physical location"?
Perhaps the data haven can do the split and farm the data out to
other data havens - but how do they know the data they're receiving
is really a slice of contraband data instead of Yet Another Plant?
It gets pretty convoluted.

of election even if the Republicans come out with another bozo,

RPK New Zealand talking about how their encryption product is
not export-controlled because it's from NZ, not the US,
and how their RPK Fast Public Key Encryptonite(tm) Engine
is the strongest crypto in the world.  Either they haven't
bothered asking for export permission, or they asked in such a way
that the export bureaucrats didn't notice it was crypto and
regulated by their crypto export preventers, or their crypto
somehow falls through the cracks, e.g. by using an algorithm with
public keys shorter than 512 bits (works for ECC, not RSA)
and private keys shorter than 40 bits (or 41 on a good day),
or perhaps passes the "snake oil test" for export permission.
I suppose it's possible that the NZ Export Bureaucrats have
lightened up since Peter's last dealings with them,
but it's not likely.
========= From Peter Gutmann's web page
This policy has resulted in New Zealand enjoying the dubious distinction of having the strictest export controls on earth, with everything ranging from crypto hardware down to software, library books, computer magazines, and journals being restricted from export.  It's not even possible for a university to publish academic research without prior permission from a government agency, and the requirements for obtaining this permission are structured to ensure that they can never be fulfilled.

A new release of the MIT SDSI/SPKI C software distribution is available.  Go to
and follow the software distribution links in the paragraph about SDSI/SPKI 2.0.  Note that you must be a US or Canadian citizen, etc., to get this software.  The following binary builds are available:
An Intel Linux build will hopefully be available soon.
These are all built from the source distribution:
As usual, many bugs were fixed in this release.  See ChangeLog in the source
distribution for the details.
More general notes from the 0.4.0 README:
Release 0.4.0
This code now requires (sequence )s to conform to the expected grammer
in the structure-06 draft, i.e., it supports the macro "def" and "ref"
mechanism, and, if threshold subject support is compiled in, the
"process-threshold" mechanism.  It will reject sequences that use
the old (do hash ) or old (do k-of-n) directives.
DSA support has been finished, and is compiled into the library by
default.  This means that SDSI2_FEATURE_STRUCTURE6_SIGS is defined by
default; since this changes the grammar for signatures to match what
is expected in the structure-06 draft, earlier signatures will break.
See the applicable blurb in the 0.3.0 notes of the README for details.
PGP support has been extended to handle what I believe to be the
majority of PGP 5.0 keyrings.  If your PGP private keyring uses IDEA
or CAST5 with MD5 or SHA1 to seal the secrets, sdsi2sh should be able
to read it.  PGP DSA keys are fully supported.
The SDSI distribution now includes MIT-written multi-precision integer
and DES libraries.  This means that you don't have to track down and
compile GNU MP and Eric Young's libdes if you don't want to.  If you
do still want to compile with one or both of these other libraries,
you can - see the main documentation for instructions on when you may
want to, and how.
The reduction code has been completely rewritten.  It's separated out
from sequences, in its own little internal API.  You step a reduction
with rules until you run out of them, and then you can get out the
conclusion that results from those rules.  It's possible to reduce
a whole (sequence ) into its equivalent (cert ), or to just reduce
two (cert )s into one.
The cache API has changed considerably, to present the face of a
generic S-expression cache.  sdsi2_cache_add_search_term is a single
function used for incrementally building a cache query, that works a
lot more intuitively than the old add_search_.._term functions did.
The actual cache format has not changed.
The ugly story of unparsing S-expressions, or filling a sdsi2Sexp, has
been completely retold.  It is now possible to allocate a new
sdsi2Stream, simply "push" canonical elements (like whole sdsi2Sexp *,
sdsi2ByteString *, integers, etc.) onto it, and then just call
sdsi2_sexp_parse to have it parse that into a new sdsi2Sexp.
Two new commands have been added to sdsi2sh: "load" and "save" allow
you to load a variable from and save a variable to a file.

The message from your friend is a purely fabricated troll;
don't worry about it.
Is that 200 Sun Microsystems Computers, or 200 of those big yellow things? :-)
Some previous versions of PGP had some weaknesses.
PGP version 1 had the cool "Bass-O-Matic" algorithm, before
Phil learned cryptography; read his discussion of Snake Oil in the manuals.
I think some of the early versions had weaknesses in their random number generators used for session keys, but I may be mixing
that up with Netscape, which definitely used to have that problem.
One of the current concerns is that the popular version 2.6.2 et al
use the MD5 hash, which is starting to show some theoretical weaknesses,
though none of them are known to be exploitable against PGP,
but the newer versions prefer to use SHA-1 as a hash just in case.
There was also a serious problem which allowed an attacker to
create a public/private key pair with the same keyID as a target (much shorter key, so quick to create, and who checks key length?),
so the newer versions use a different method for creating keyIDs
that's hard to spoof.  Early versions also used shorter KeyIDs,
so it was possible to get a collision by brute force, so the keyIDs
were made longer.  Impersonating a KeyID makes it possible to fake
signatures, and also possible to trick PGP or the user into trusting the wrong key, which is always bad.
The secret key ring file has two current weaknesses,
which matter if somebody can access your file (so don't let that happen!)
One is that if you have wimpy passphrases, a dictionary attack can
crack the record containing your private key, at which point you lose -
so don't use a wimpy passphrase, AND do protect your secret keyring well.
Another, less serious is that the file contains the user name in plaintext - so if you're trying to hide your secret identity, someone reading the file will see that you not only have keys for Clark Kent, but also for Superman;
in some environments, this can be more dangerous than cracking the
passphrase, because the guys with rubber hoses can get your passphrase
once they know they want it.

It's an interesting problem, and I doubt there's a consensus on strength,
in particular, on how much randomness is left after you take a
random sample out of the system.  I'd feel much better if you
also ran the output through a keyed hash before giving it to anyone
(e.g. run pairs or triples of 64-bit blocks plus a private salt through MD5.)
With a perfectly strong RNG, the output should also be perfectly strong,
though with a weak RNG, the block cypher does add some correlation.
You definitely should trash the initial outputs, until you've added
enough bits of real randomness that the block chaining step has
probably accumulated a whole block's worth of randomness.
Otherwise, the first round of block cypher is an ECB on a small
set of input data (e.g. 64 possible values of one 1 and 63 0s
fed into a DES cracker.)

G**dT*mes and its ilk are hoaxes, which infect the mind of some readers,
causing Fear and Panic, and propagating around like chain letters.
But the fear-causing part is the assertion that if you read the message,
it will execute on your computer and do Bad Scary Things.
In the case of G**dT*mes, this was bogus, but it doesn't have to be.
In a passive-mail-reader environment, this won't happen,
because there's no reason your mailreader will execute commands embedded in email, but if you've got a mail-reader that
executes scripts sent to it in the mail, you don't need the human reader's participation to spread things,
you just need to tell the mail-reader to propagate and then
do whatever payload you've sent along as well.
The IBM Christmas-Tree Virus didn't use Fear to execute -
it promised the readers an amusing animated Christmas Tree on their terminals
(back when that was still perceived as cool :-) and if the sucker ran it,
it ran its propagation phase before or during the animation.
And back when we used Real Terminals instead of emulators,
you could send a crafty escape sequence to an HP2621 or VT100
to stash material in a register or on the screen and
get it sent back to the computer.  If you made a good guess
about the environment, this was enough ("Quit mailreader, run /tmp/boom".)
There was an article in the SFChron or Oakland Trib in spring 1979
about how "hackers at Berkeley" discovered a security hole in
"the Unix, a computer made by DEC", which was really a terminal exploit.
How good is that VT100 emulator you're using to telnet to that shell account?

@_subject: anonymous mailboxes 
One way to do pseudonymous email boxes is to use a web-based
mailbox server such as hotmail and pick up the mail through
anonymizers or onion routers.  Obviously you need SSL for the
anonymizer connections, and for the mailbox connection as well,
and the name of the mailbox needs to be in the encrypted portion
of the SSL requests rather than in the sniffable URL parts.
The main threat is eavesdroppers watching the anonymizers
over a period of time, picking up patterns that may not show
during a single mail pickup.  So you need enough anonymizers out there, or enough cover traffic on a smaller number of anonymizers, but it should basically be doable.
It also helps if you can send mail to the mailer using the web,
with SSL and chains of anonymizers to do it, to protect the sender,
but anonymous remailers can also solve that problem.

@_subject: Lucent Researcher Cracks PKCS#1, SSL 
Lucent researcher cracks encryption code
By Margaret Kane, ZDNet
An encryption researcher has discovered a software flaw that could allow a hacker to break the software codes used for electronic commerce.
The problem protocols use the Public Key Cryptography Standard  including the Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL standard. RSA Data Security Inc., which defined the standard, said that the vulnerability does not
apply to PKCS  secure messaging protocols, such as Secure Electronic Transactions and Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension because they are not susceptible to -- and already implement --
mechanisms preventing this potential vulnerability. But at a Web site using SSL, a hacker could break the code by sending millions of messages to the target server and observing the server's response.
That information could be used to decode an intercepted session, said Daniel Bleichenbacher, a researcher at Lucent Technologies Inc.'s (Nasdaq:LU) Bell Labs. A slew of software companies announced today that they are working on a patch for the problem, and will post it on their Web sites. RSA, a division of Security Dynamics Technologies, (Nasdaq:SDTI) said it is working with IBM (Nasdaq:IBM), Microsoft Corp.(Nasdaq:MSFT), Netscape Communications Corp. (Nasdaq:NSCP), Open Market Inc. (Nasdaq:OMKT), and others on the problem. RSA is also working with the CERT Coordination Center on the problem, which has posted a technical advisory about the situation. Reuters contributed to this story. ++++++++++++++++++ Extracted From Another web page there m+++++++++++++
SSL flaw could expose encrypted data
A researcher at Lucent Technologies Inc.'s Bell Laboratories has discovered a vulnerability in the SSL encryption commonly used in electronic commerce transactions.
The flaw, which has been exposed only in a laboratory setting, would allow a hacker to capture encrypted data in a session between a browser and server.
The vulnerability is hardly a fatal flaw in SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). Rather, it's a hole that a savvy Web site administrator should be able to spot before a hacker can do any damage.
"The good news here is that you still have to be pretty smart to break it," said Julie Ferguson, chief technology officer of ClearCommerce Corp., in Austin, Texas.
The researcher, Daniel Bleichenbacher, who works in the secure systems research department of Bell Labs, in Murray Hill, N.J., found a way for a hacker to derive the session key used in a transaction by feeding off the error messages created by a server.
First, the hacker must prepare roughly 1 million messages to send against the server to capture the information. Bleichenbacher said he created an algorithm that analyzes those messages and derives the session key--which is randomly generated for each transaction by a combination of public and private keys at the Web site and the consumer's browser. Still, a competent site administrator should notice that his Web site has suddenly received a barrage of bad messages.
"It should be very easy to see that an attack is taking place," Bleichenbacher said. The hacker would also have to capture a session at some point on the line, likely at an Internet service provider, not knowing whether there is information within it that is worth stealing.
Because a session key is randomly generated for each session, it's possible for a hacker to capture information only about that individual session, said officials at RSA Data Security Inc., which developed SSL in conjunction with Netscape Communications Corp.
The flaw, technically found in the standard called the Public Key Cryptography System  does not apply to encryption algorithms themselves but rather to the way packets are placed into encrypted envelopes. PKCS is due to be upgraded next month, and the latest revision will account for the newly found vulnerability, said Scott Schnell, vice president of marketing at RSA, in Redwood City, Calif.
 The implications are perhaps most serious for home banking, because a hacker using this flaw could capture a user's banking information.
Although there are no known real-world attacks taking advantage of this SSL flaw, software vendors promise to have patches that mask the error messages. Netscape, in Mountain View, Calif., already has one available on its Web site for several applications, including Netscape Enterprise Server, Netscape Proxy Server and the company's messaging servers.
Microsoft Corp. also has created a fix that masks the error messages that a hacker would rely upon. Officials of the Redmond, Wash., company said they have worked with Netscape to ensure that their respective fixes do not create interoperability problems.
Both companies said they have already alerted major customers about the problem and provided them with fixes.

               Vulnerable Applications
               June 26, 1998 -- RSA Data Security, Inc. today
               announced guidelines to assist its OEM customers in
               both assessing their productsï¿½ vulnerability to a newly
               discovered potential security attack, and to identify
               pre-emptive countermeasures to thwart such an attack.                The guidelines are designed to help developers
               understand the nature and mechanism of the threat,
               pose a series of technical questions to identify
               vulnerable constructs in the developerï¿½s software
               design, and provide a set of countermeasures from
               which to choose based on the developerï¿½s needs.                These guidelines are available online at
                              The potential threat affects server products that employ
               an interactive key establishment protocol in conjunction
               with the PKCS  standard for digital envelopes,
               including SSL-based servers.  SET (Secure Electronic
               Transaction) and other secure messaging protocols,
               such as S/MIME (Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail
               Extension), are not susceptible to or already implement
               mechanisms preventing this potential attack.                Recent research by cryptographer Daniel
               Bleichenbacher of the Bell Labs Secure Systems
               Research Department, the research and development
               arm of Lucent Technologies, indicate that the above
               combination is potentially vulnerable to a class of attack
               known as Adaptive Chosen Ciphertext Attacks.  The
               potential attack noted by Mr. Bleichenbacher relies on
               sending a target server on the order of a million carefully
               constructed messages and observing variations in the
               serverï¿½s response.  As such, the attack is both
               detectable and can be prevented with countermeasures.
               For some developers, the most effective countermeasure
               is incorporation of the Optimal Asymmetric Encryption
               Padding (OAEP) technology, a method of formatting an
               encrypted message so that attackers cannot learn
               information about the contents through repeated
               probing.  OAEP is designed to thwart a variety of
               attacks, including the Adaptive Chosen Ciphertext
               Attack.
               For other developers, the most effective countermeasure
               will be preventing an assailant from gaining information
               from messages returned from their server.  RSAï¿½s
               guidelines provide design information for developers to
               use in implementing this form of countermeasure as well.
               RSA Laboratories, the research arm of RSA, plans to
               include OAEP in the next version of  PKCS  a widely
               used cryptography standard, that will be available as a
               draft for comment in July.  PKCS  is used in SSL and
               other popular security mechanisms to provide
               confidentiality for exchange of symmetric encryption
               keys (digital envelopes), as well as to construct digital
               signatures.                 OAEP has already been integrated into RSAï¿½s newest
               release of BSAFEï¿½ 4.0, the companyï¿½s flagship
               cryptographic security development suite which began
               shipping this month.  RSA intends to make available
               OAEP updates conforming to the new PKCS                specification for its BSAFE 3.0 and 4.0 products in July,
               and to incorporate OAEP in an upcoming version of
               JSAFEï¿½, RSAï¿½s security engine for Javaï¿½.  RSA
               recommends that developers target these upcoming
               OAEP updates for inclusion in their products.  Check
               this site for more information on OAEP updates in the

@_subject: saving the world from a cancerous monopoly 
Attlia - you'd probably enjoy reading
a recent book by some MS ex-insiders on how MS became what it is.
Windows 3.0, for instance, wasn't supposed to muscle out OS/2,
but the developers of Word/Excel/Powerpoint (which they originally
wrote for the Macintosh) got better development/porting support from the small group of developers on the low-status backwater
leftover Windoze team than from the high-profile IBM OS/2 partnership,
and Win3.0 was ready to ship when they were, unlike the upcoming
insanely great next version of OS/2.  When it sold a million copies
in a few months, Gates had to deal with it, and suddenly Windows
became a strategic product again, and gradually OS/2 became the leftover.
Gates has only gouged consumers by selling us crap which we buy,
either because we need compatibility with other users of their products,
or because we work for big companies who have centralized decision-
making droids who buy it.  Better than Gates tells my corporate droids what to buy than Janet Reno,
Louis Freeh, or FCCmeister Kennard.  Not only do they have even less taste,
but they'd solve the problem by taking a long time to do the spec,
which wouldn't have enough details to interoperate with anything except the
National Information Infrastructure Data Entry Escrow Protocol.
Personally, I disliked WordPerfect immensely
(though I last used it back when it and MSWord were character-based),
and Word has acquired enough features to be about as flaky and unpredictable as WP was back then.  Excel is friendly, and I don't use s
preadsheets enough to prefer something else.  Powerpoint reeks,
and the integration between Word and Powerpoint reeks badly.
Good for him - would you rather he spent the money acquiring other parts of the software industry or Seattle real estate?
He also spent a pile of money trying to outflank the Internet with MSN,
and lost badly.  Are you still running Microsoft BoB?

@_subject: Newbie pgp question 
Remember how PGP works:
PGP picks a random session key, and encrypts it with the public key
of the recipient (using RSA or a Diffie-Hellman version),
and encrypts the message with the session key.
The recipient's private key is encrypted with the passphrase
for the private key and stored in secring.pgp.
When the recipient wants to decrypt the message, they type
their passphrase into PGP, which decrypts the private key
from the secring and uses it to decrypt the session key from the message,
and uses the session key to decrypt the message body.
The session key is long, and you won't crack it.
RSA depends on factoring big numbers, and if the user has a 512-bit
public key or a longer public key _you_ won't be able to crack it.
(The KGB might*, and a distributed internet crack might, but you won't.)
But the passphrase for decrypting the private key from the secring file
is picked by the user - some users use short stupid keys, and other users use long difficult keys, and short stupid keys can be cracked.
The user needs to protect their secring file, to prevent this attack,
but if you have their secring, you can try to crack it.
If this is your _own_ secring, and you can't remember your passphrase,
it's easier, because you probably know what words you use in passphrases,
so your dictionary can be short and the crack can be fast.
If you stole somebody else's secring, or somebody else store yours,
then you have to guess what kind of dictionary to use.
This only works for the recipient's secring - if you steal the sender's
secring, even if you crack their passphrase, it doesn't help,
because that's only used when somebody sends them messages,
or when they sign messages (and now you can forge them.)
*I assume you're not the KGB or Mafia, because then you would just
beat up the guy until he gives you the passphrase.

@_subject: I was auto-outed by an IMG tag in HTML spam 
Nonsense.  E-Mail is an interface for mailing stuff to people,
and an email system that can't handle large documents is broken.
In particular, the MickeysoftMail view that the contents of a message
belong in attachments rather than message body is broken
(it's partly due to myopia, and partly because some of the popular
Windows GUI programming widgets can't handle more than 32KB.)
First of all, you don't need a web browser to read HTML.
Eudora doesn't use one - it displays it natively.
(If you attach an HTML attachment rather than putting HTML in the body,
then you need an HTML viewer (which may or may not be a web browser), but that's the same as needing a text viewer to view text attachments.)
Furthermore, HTML is written in ASCII, and designed to be human-readable,
and designed so the user can choose how to display it -
HTML viewers are supposed to display documents in the user's preferred
formats given the limitations of the display device.
If you like Netscape or IE 4.x browsers to view HTML, use them, but if you'd prefer Lynx for a lean, mean browser, or MSWord or another viewer like HoTMetaL, go ahead.
Some people like to send rich-text attachments.  HTML is a much better
standard for doing that than some MS proprietary format.
Most of the rich text mail I get at work is in proprietary MS formats,
(most of it that I get at home is SPAM :-), which means I need to use
a buggy bloated word processor to read it, except when Exchange
feels like using its Outlook Evil Twin to display the stuff,
but it's somewhat pleasant to have colors and fonts available.
40 bit?  Not good, but domestic versions are supposed to support 128;
maybe they don't in practice.  (NS 3.x was bloated enough that I haven't
upgraded to 4.x)   And getting people in the habit of using
crypto is a good thing.  Bill Stewart, bill.stewart at pobox.com

Nice article, and I'll have to see if I can get Ian
to talk about HINDE for this month's Bay Area Cypherpunks.
One thing I noticed while reading it, though, is that you still have
"and then you go to jail" at the end of some transaction failure branches,
though most of the failure branches end with "Nothing happens".
While you're not doing book entry at every step,
bearer instruments still depend on the maker honoring them,
whether it's exchanging the bank note for gold pieces
or trading the digicash bits for Federal Reserve Notes --
"then the banker goes to jail" can still happen,
and a digicash world may not have as many S&L Bailout
political favors as the Reagan Years provided.
Also, there are the transactions where you trade
digicash for goods&services, and there's still the problem
of making sure the goods&services got delivered,
making sure the payment got delivered, and dealing with
poor quality products.  For purely digital products,
like consulting hours, movies, and microcode, there are
protocols that can take care of the exchange,
but for goods&services involving real stuff,
like pizza delivery, there's still an element of
trust required.

@_subject: tripwires when you're not superuser. 
In the general case, you can't do it, though there may be
special environments which let you do this but still let you
do useful work.
If somebody else controls the RAM, file systems, and communications
on a computer, and you don't, you have no way to tell what they've done.
For instance, anybody who can read raw blocks off the disk can
read your files without triggering any mechanisms you control.
Anybody who can read incoming packets off the LAN and WAN
can read your email before putting it in your mailbox.
If you convince people to encrypt mail before sending it to you,
and you encrypt any data you store on the system's disk blocks, using programs that aren't running on that computer,
reading your stuff may not be very interesting to the sysadm.
But if you run the decryption program on the system,
and the sysadm can read your keystrokes (either from a keyboard
or tty driver or telnet daemon), you're still naked.
There's been some theoretical work done into computing entirely
with encrypted data, and for a few specific mathematical problems
it's probably possible to get useful work done by an untrusted processor,
but usually the computations required for blinding and unblinding
are more work that the untrusted processor did for you anyway.
Short of that, the closest you'll find are secure operating systems
rated at Orange Book B2 or above (B3 and A, if any), which don't
have one all-powerful superuser.  In those systems, if the person
who has access to the raw disk (either physically or by asking the OS)
doesn't cheat, you have some guarantees about security, and in particular
you have some guarantees that nobody _but_ the semi-super-users
can crack the system in ways that give them access to your bits.
Unless all writes to the disk drive are encrypted, anybody who's got
unsupervised physical access to the disk is a semi-super-user, because they can steal the disk and plug it into their own machine,
where they're as super a user as they want to be.
If you're concerned about the machine being physically compromised,
you could set up an application that's always sending keepalives
across the net to your off-site monitoring location, but that's
pretty annoying, leads to lots of false alarms, may still be crackable
(though cracking may interrupt the system briefly, which is the win),
and is overall not very practical.  But it might let you know
that the disk drive has been stolen.

Generally, it's neither one, but it is a rude imposition on
the reader's attention, and may also increase costs to the user
or the user's service provider.
So what's an anarchist like me doing saying that the government can help?
Well, they can help by getting out of the way.  Currently, there are laws against breaking into computer systems
and against denial of service attacks; they can be Federal felonies.
As a modest proposal, I would suggest that the government allow
anyone who's been sent unwanted bits by a spammer to send
any unwanted bits they feel like in return.
Maybe Spamford doesn't want chain letters about
or	"Free Live Chat With Real Spammers!"

10 Laws the Net Needs
CNet Features
               By Susan Stellin
               (3/23/98)
               When the U.S. Congress passed the
               Communications Decency Act in 1995, Net
               activists staged a collective revolt. Protestors set up
               anti-CDA Web pages, launched campaigns to stop Net
               censorship, and hit the streets to voice their
               opposition.
               When the Supreme Court struck down the CDA,
               many online activists breathed a sigh of relief.
               But as it turns out, that law was just a preview of
               things to come.
               This year, there are more than 50 bills before
               Congress that propose some kind of Internet
               regulation. And policymakers from China to the
               European Union have been equally busy.
               Like it or not, this genie's been let out of the
               bottle; Net laws are on the way. So as the saying
               goes, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
               We've taken the lead on this one and drafted ten
               of our own Internet laws: proposals dealing with
               real issues like the proliferation of spam, the
               invasion of online privacy, and yes, the too-easy
               access to pornography. Some of our ideas match
               bills Congress is already considering; others
               address problems that Washington hasn't thought
               of yet.
               Brazen? You bet. In fact, not everyone at CNET
               agrees with all of these proposals--and you may
               not either.
               So we've decided to put them up for a vote.
               We've paired each law with an electronic ballot
               box. So exercise your (virtual) right to vote, and let
               us know how on-track--or off-base--our ideas are.
               The polls are open...
               Susan Stellin is an executive editor at CNET. The
               ideas expressed in this article are her own and do not

@_subject: Chaffing & winnowing without overhead 
So why not _send_ the plaintext in the clear?
Send the 0 bit, and the bit from the MAC0, and the 1 and the MAC1 bit
Yes, it's expanding the data 4:1, but that's much better than before.
I strongly agree.  I had proposed using a short checksum,
e.g. 8 bits of the MAC, which does leave collisions every ~256 sets,
but this is almost as short a checksum as you can get,
and eliminates the collision except every ~2**64 pairs.
If you do include the data bits, you maintain (very marginally)
the letter of the requirement here.  What you do lose
with this method is the ability to mix traffic from different people;
1 bit of MAC just isn't enough to pick out your own bits.
Any short MAC limits the amount of mixing you can do;
an 8-bit MAC lets you mix a bit without too many collisions,
and a 64-bit MAC should be enough for any mixture you'd
ever bother with (probably 16 or 32 would as well,
though especially for 16 you'd still need a longitudinal
checksum or some method of handling rare collisions.)
Is it close enough for government work?  Probably.

By the way, instead of transmitting the first bit for which
MAC(sequence,0) differs from MAC(sequence,1), as Jesï¿½s suggests,
you can get the same effect by transmitting a 0 or 1 depending on
    MAC(sequence,0) < MAC(sequence,1)
(This assumes a big-endian system and unsigned comparisons;
little-endians will have to calculate it the hard way.)  If you're willing to be wrong 1 time out of 2**33, you can just use the top 32 bits.
Earlier in this discussion:
But that _does send the 2^n plaintexts, which are 0 and 1, and n=1.

@_subject: Chaffing and winnowing 
[Is this still appropriate for coderpunks?]
But it _doesn't_ obliterate the plaintext channel;
it just obfuscates it a lot.
Depending on how sequence numbers are managed, it doesn't need to double it - if you try the MAC for 0, it either
succeeds or fails, and in either case you don't need to check the MAC for 1.  If you're using a shorter MAC which
might have collisions (e.g. 8 bits of a real MAC), you need to
check both, since both 0 and 1 could pass, trashing the bit,
and if you're using the "First different bit in MAC(0) and MAC(1)"
technique you obviously need to calculate both.
It's easy to demonstrate that the wheat channel is using real MACs -
if you're hauled into court for some violation or lawsuit,
you can probably be ordered to deliver the key (if you kept it),
since it's "not" being used to keep the message secret,
"only" to authenticate it.  For the chaffing techniques that can use random chaff, though, you really can't prove that the "random" numbers are random as opposed to stegotext without giving up the stegotext
unless they're generated by a pseudo-random algorithm
which uses a key you can reproduce (as opposed to a session key from /dev/random.)
Will the real use of chaffing/winnowing be to send
uninteresting cover traffic and carry stegotext as chaff?

@_subject: Non-anonymous remailers 
Feh - anybody who wants non-anonymous remailers should include his name :-)
On the other hand, perhaps the allegedly anonymous author didn't
believe the purported name of the alleged proposer, or chose to
phrase the proposal in the exculpatory passive voice.
Good point.  Overkill, and inadequate.  Let's start with overkill:
- If you require all outgoing email to be encrypted,
  you don't have constructive knowledge that your system
  is being abused.  Legally, that should be significant protection;
  rules about not being liable for things you don't know you did
  are much harder to change than rules about things you know.
- Posting a big sign requiring conformance with policies,
  backed up by occasional action against violators,
  helps establish your presumption of good character.
- Requiring all outgoing mail to be encrypted makes spamming
  much more difficult (today), though in the Great Cryptographic Future,
  when everybody has at least one easily-located public key,
  that's less effective - but even then it significantly increases
  the workload for the spammer (though Moore's Law makes that less
  relevant, and good Crypto APIs make development of spamware easy.)
  It doesn't stop harassers, but it does reduce spam.
- A few Supreme Court cases, such as Talley and McIntyre,
  protect the right to anonymous speech, including commercial,
  so the proposed law has a high bogosity index.
For inadequacy, there are a variety of problems:
- Zero-knowledge proofs can at most verify that there's an identifier
  in some defined format or from some accessible list of keys.
  They can't verify that the message really came from
  the homeless person who allegedly sent the mail, nor that the
  address, phone number, or email named can locate a real body.
  They also tend to need special forms for the data, which may not
  work for CA-format key signatures.
- ZKPs aren't very useful for identifying the insides of   multiply-encrypted data - so they only give you one hop at a time,
  and only for cooperative remailers in cooperative jurisdictions.
- Protocols that provide information about the insides of
  an encrypted message are notoriously hard to make both
  secure and useful.
Distinctly true, though the easiest way to achieve that is to
separate the two problems, providing solid privacy protection
outside and letting the users sign the inside message if they want.

Forwarded from linux-ipsec at clinet.fi - posted by Hugh Daniel   I would like to announce for the FreeS/WAN software team that they
now have a freeswan-0.8 release available for download from the
FreeS/WAN home page at:
  The 0.8 (and target 1.0 in June) runs only in a VPN (tunnel) mode,
protecting and encrypting net traffic for a subnet behind the SG.
This setup is called a SG for Security Gateway.  We plan on
implementing the rest of the IPSEC and IKE draft standards in our 2.0
release later this summer for the 2.1.xxx and 2.2.xx series Linux
  There is some useful documentation for the current FreeS/WAN done by
Kai Martius at:
      The 0.8 release has been tested extensively in the hand keyed
ESP-3DES-HMAC-MD5-96 tunnel mode and is quite robust.  On a 150Mhz 586
Clone PC TCP throughput is over 320 Kbytes/second sustained as
measured by netperf.
  The IKE daemon pluto has been tested only a very little and
sometimes works and sometimes does not.  It will work for the simple
VPN case before 1.0.
  Feedback, new features, documentation, scripts and bug fixes &
reports are especially useful in the next few weeks before we start in
on the 0.9x series of release working up to a stable 1.0 release in
June.  Don't wait for the last minute to submit that neat feature or
bug fix, as we might not have time to include it!
  If you have questions about the project please see our home page
where you will find a mail list, list archives, FTP directory's etc.
  Thanks to everyone who made this release possible, but mostly the
people who coded it up!
  Please post all bugs, fixes, code etc. to the public email list at

No, you can't.  I've got some sample Kong documents below.

if you tell James's page you're not a US/Canadian citizen.
Some UnAmerican should hack their way through James's protection

If you check the signature on a document identical to one
you've already got stored, it'll tell you about it, and list
all the usernames that have signed that document.
When you try to store a second key with the same name as an existing key,
it'll tell you that they're different, and let you add a note to the new one.
(Unfortunately, it doesn't also let you add a note to the first one;

@_subject: TEMPEST laptops 
Yup.   Most of it's SECRET COMSEC or CONFIDENTIAL COMSEC.
The parts I'm aware of cover making equipment not radiate,
blocking radiation that does occur, and making sure signals
don't leak between the red and black sides.  There's presumably
much more secret documentation at NSA about how to spy on stuff,
and there's no way you'll get any of that.
That too.  TEMPEST, like other security problems,
depends a lot on your threat models - you need a lot quieter equipment
if there's an NSA Antenna Van parked in your driveway
than if you're out in an empty field with nobody around for miles.
What the equipment specs tell you is what the military thinks
is adequate protection for typical threat environments,
such as defense contractor office buildings or low-tech battlefields.
The last time I checked, which was 8-10 years ago,
there was a lot of TEMPEST-certified equipment on the market,
though many of the vendors would only sell to the government
and businesses working on TEMPEST-requiring government contracts.
The main things on the market back then were
- Room/building enclosure technology, so you could put lots of
regular computer equipment in a big shielded room.
This includes heavy-duty filtering of power supplies;
our equipment was quite happy with it's nice clean power feeds.
- Shielded minicomputers - basically stuck in rack-sized versions
of room enclosures, with fiber-optic comm lines or shielded cables.
- Quiet PCs, which generally had heavier metal cases, shielded cables,
rather heavy keyboards, and lots of shielding in the monitors.
They tended to cost about $5000 more than the equivalent non-TEMPEST PC.
I don't know how the market is today, but it's probably a LOT more work
to quiet and/or shield a 400MHz Pentium2 than a 4.77Mhz 8086 -
higher frequency signals have shorter wavelengths, so they can
leak through smaller holes, and the newer Pentiums probably put out a
lot more energy above 3GHz than 8086s did, which means that
centimeter-long cracks can leak signals.
At the time, the rule of thumb for room shielding was that you
wanted 100dB attenuation; the actual specs were
more complex than that, and presumably classified.
We did our routine measurements using a 450MHz transmitter, which would let us find any leaks that evolved from wear&tear
on our doors or wiring mistakes on our comm or power gear
(like forgetting to screw some lid on tight enough),
but the TEMPEST contractors did the official complex measurements.
This was a significant change from Vietnam-era shielding,
which was typically copper mesh that provided 60dB attenuation
Just using a regular laptop isn't enough; I've seen laptops
transmit recognizable images to a television (though I was probably
using AC power rather than batteries, and may or may not have had
the display mode set to LCD-and-monitor.)

My reading is the same as yours -
the law was written carelessly, and wrong (unless JYA forgot the paragraph defining
"mass" as "intended to kill more than N people", but it doesn't look like it.)
That means that any chemical weapon, including your can of mace or pepper spray,
that might be construed as causing "serious bodily injury",
makes you a terrorist using weapons of mass destruction.
Might get worse - lead _is_ toxic, and causes injury by impact.
It's a bad law, and it's going to be abused, and this case is a great one for the Feds to use to set bad precedent with,
since the Republic of Texas are a bunch of incompetent wackos.
Not sure, but it means that the Feds aren't terrorists if _they_
threaten or conspire to use weapons of mass destruction,
but you would be if you did.  It also probably means that foreign governments aren't covered here, but foreign NGOs are,
e.g. the IRA.
The standard clause used to give the Feds jurisdiction over things;
given Roosevelt-era courts deciding that a farmer feeding his own grain
to his own hogs affects interstate commerce, surely email or the
World Wide Web counts as interstate, as does killing anybody
who might cross state lines or buy some product that does.
(Of course, given the number of politicians who are for sale,
removing a few of them from the market can pretty legitimately

One reason their rhetoric looks so weird is because it's avoiding
coming straight out and saying "Our plan for fixing society is to have the government fund teaching of Transcendental Meditation(r) to everybody,
and once everybody is doing TM, they'll all be healthier, better behaved,
and will do things in accordance with The Laws Of Nature As Taught By
the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, so the problems of the world will all fix themselves."
Meanwhile, of course, they describe their national health plans as using
"Proven Scientific Principles" (TM having been proven to fix everything)
and their education plans using similar obfuscatory rhetoric.
(On the other hand, I haven't heard them saying that the TM-Siddhi program
will let them replace the Air Force with levitation yet;
they tend to take the view that calmness and niceness will scientifically
reduce the need to shoot people, which I can't fault them for too much...)
It's basically a wimpier version of traditional Western moral reformers pushing the view that if government gets rid of Sin, society will work better,
but getting rid of ignorance is usually a "kinder, gentler" process,
not that you want to tell the ignorant what you're doing,
because they may think that offering fruit and flowers to a guru's picture
and chanting the name of a fire-god while breathing quietly
is not only a strange way to fix ignorance but is an inappropriate thing for governments to spend their money on, especially in the name of Science.
Most of the Natural Law Party candidates I've talked to, except when
they're on direct meditation-revenue-enhancement topics, tend to be
reasonable folks, somewhere in the liberal-to-libertarian range,
thinking the government should mostly let people do what they want,
which will naturally lead to calmness and niceness as they follow natural law, and a lot of the TM folks, especially around
Maharishi University in Iowa, have gone into business for themselves,
so they prefer lower government interference and red tape.
On the other hand, like any small party trying to get enough candidates
to run full slates for office, some of their folks really are flakes :-)
I like to believe that Libertarians do better on that score,
but we've got our share as well, and the only real way out of it
is to grow large enough that the supply of people willing to run
includes enough competent people.
On the other hand, it's still tempting to see about putting Frank Zappa
on the ballot.  He is a bit metabolically challenged these days,
but it wouldn't bother him much, and he's still be a better candidate
than most live Democrats or Republicans.

@_subject: Semi-relevant spam - Re: legislation -- read 
It was SPAM, but it does have some relevance to the digital cash business,
so I'll comment on it.  The IP address really is tokensystems.com.
They're in the business of selling tokens and/or tickets which
customers can buy and use to pay for access to web sites,
and which web site owners can redeem for cash with tokensystems.
Tickets cost $1 (I think something they sell is 10 cents, though),
and tokensystems keeps 40% of the take, giving the web site 60%.
The target market is viewing artwork on the net, and they claim
to have sold over 4 million tokens, presumably mostly the porn market
(unlike Mark Twain, which probably never handled that much Digicash :-)
The attraction for customers is that unlike plunking down $X
on credit card for membership at a given web site that they might or
might not think was worthwhile, creates lots of credit card transaction records, and which would definitely sell their info to spammers, they make one transaction and buy tokens which can be used
at multiple sites, reducing the number of transactions.
Tokensystems doesn't list a privacy policy (except that they offer a ticket-buying page that doesn't have porn ads for sites that prefer it).
Don't know if this means they don't have a policy, or if their policy is to sell customer info to anyone they can.
If they do offer privacy, they might want to post a privacy policy page
(usng whatever ETrust / TrustE calls itself these days),
and it might be an interesting market for Chaumian blinded tokens,
since customers might like knowing their token uses aren't
traceable back to their purchase records.
They also don't say what they do for fraud prevention - looks like
it's probably online clearing, which reduces their risk,
and makes digicash relatively convenient to deploy.

There are scurrilous rumors that some people actually put bogus information on their free email accounts!  (My cat certainly didn't do that :-)
But the portal services can keep records of who's connecting to them,
at least by IP address, which can be traced back to ISPs,
and from there back to phone lines, etc., depending on the extent
of records the various ISPs keep.  It's not enough without anonymizers.
I suspect this is what will replace the current remailer system -
chaining through some set of Crowds, Onions, and commercial and free
anonymizers to reach a free email system to transmit and receive email.
An interesting project would be a free low-volume anonymizer cgi for Apache,
given the large number of current users and the much larger number
of people who will run web servers once they have cable modems.

If you're asking "_Should_ I use GOST?", the answer is "No, not unless you really, really understand it,
and there's something it does much better for you than
more open cryptosystems, such as 3DES, RC4, or Blowfish."
GOST isn't just one cryptosystem; it's a family with different S-Boxes,
one or more sets for the Soviet military, one set commonly seen publicly,
some sets made by software writers, etc.
The strength depends critically on the values chosen for the S-Boxes,
and the Soviet military kept theirs secure.
Maybe the Russian Army or other ex-Soviet countries' armies use it,
and maybe the KGB understood it well enough for this to be ok,
if you think trusting the KGB or Soviet Military Intelligence
for advice on cryptosystems can make something ok...
But even if you understand the algorithm well enough to know how strong it is, and that's strong enough for you, why bother?
There are publicly analyzed algorithms that are strong enough
and well-analyzed, like 3DES, and algorithms that are fast and strong,
like Blowfish or correctly-used RC4.

Looks easy enough to do, if a bit ugly, where "ugly" is somewhat equivalent to
"build yet another local proxy widget to hide the gory details",
though it's not really much uglier than doing a good anonymizer,
and getting details like cookies and Java/script right are harder.
Define "encrypted" as "PGP or something like it".  It may be possible
to gain some efficiencies by using SSL, but not critical.
Take a cgi script and use POST to hand it an encrypted block containing:
The script fetches the URL, handing along any data,
packages the response in HTTP reply format, and encrypts it with the response key for the client proxy to unpack.
To chain these, have the client nest the requests, doing a
URL that points to another anonymizer script and POSTs an encrypted block.
Eventually you'll get to a non-anonymizing URL;
it may be interesting to include any expected cookies in the block,
so the client can hand them to the destination web server,
or to gain some efficiencies by having the cgi script fetch
any IMG requests, and sending a bundle of HTTP reply packets
instead of just a single one.
The problems - - How can easily can you break the system?  --- Does it leave too many open connections that can be followed?
--- Does the decreasing size of the requests and
--- What other obvious security holes are there?
- Timeouts or other problems?
- Denial of service attacks?

Of course they are, and everybody's pretty much known it all along,

Much of it corresponded nicely with "urban renewal", the 60s policy

Depends substantially on what kind of information it is,

as well as just hacker advice.  IANAL, but there are a range
of torts from libel or slander to invasion of privacy to
emotional distress that sometimes apply, if you're into

is a public figure, this seldom works, and if the information

Alternatively, there's the Big Gun Flame War approach of making sure everyone knows what an unresponsive loser the web site providers are, though that does lose the opportunity to quietly get the information to go away, even if it hasn't already been
sucked down by Altavista, Yahoo, Hotbot, and DejaNews.
Most web sites are either on big commercial hosting sites with
relatively responsive abuse at wherever contacts, or else they're
smaller sites which get connectivity and/or hosting service

Nonsense.  Governments are the ones who claim legitimacy for
their theft, violence, and extortion.  Free markets consider those things
to be bad, though in some free markets they're for sale anyway.
Nonsense again.  Social institutions aren't a market issue,
though some services provided by them can also be provided by markets,
i.e. hiring people to do things.  They're a social issue, and people will form social institutions to do things if they want.
Absence of coercion doesn't mean absence of cooperation.
Anarchists are perfectly good at having schools, churches,
volunteer fire companies, theater groups, and soup kitchens,
and they still raise their kids, live inside if they want,
do fun things together, and do necessary things together.
Just because you don't have a social institution that announces
that it has the job of killing anybody who competes with it or
fails to obey its proclamations of the will of the majority
doesn't mean you don't have social institutions.
You've sure got the cart before the horse here.
Most anarchists I know, whether leftists or libertarians,
care more about justice and equity than any government
I've encountered (maybe not more than the citizens
ruled by the government, but more than the government itself.)
We just don't think a State is a good or likely way to get them,
given too much experience to the contrary, even if some occasional
groups of people have some limited success running a limited government
for short periods of time.
You're building assumptions into your terminology here....
it's only international if you've got nations.
But assuming you mean interactions between groups of people
living in different places who act different, sure,
we recognize them, whether they're across an ocean,
or a Big River, or just across town.  Doesn't mean we can't
peacefully trade with each other, and doesn't mean that some of them
won't occasionally try to rip us off.  Huh?  I've been told time and time again "This is a democracy,
majority rules, it's America and you'll do it our way,
love it or leave it, conform or we'll beat you up."
Democracy means that other people can tell you what to do,
and if it works for them you'd better hope it works for you
because you're stuck with it.   There are other systems where
smaller groups of people can tell everybody else what to do,
which can be worse than democracy, like monarchies or slave states,
but somehow the purported "limited government" have been
much less limited in theory than in practice, and justice and equity are for those people who are more equal than others.

Back in the 60s (well, 70s) we could get stoned smoking just about anything;
didn't matter if it was psychoactive or not, as long as you really _wanted_ to believe you'd get stoned  from it. :-)  I mean, if it worked
with banana peels, it'd work with just about anything...
On the other hand, an acquaintance of mine and some of his druggie friends

You do not want to try this.  He said it hits you with all the bad
caffeine side effects, all at once.

which can ostensibly get THC into the hops while looking like an

@_subject: NSA Threatens To "OUT" Republicans Over Hubbell Investigation 
Encryption is NOT just "mathematics, period".  It's mathematics,
plus operations, password management, key distribution,
keeping track of who's allowed to see what, plus hardware and operating systems to run the mathematics on,
and unless you're running it in wetware, it's also
computer security to protect the hardware and operating systems.
And it's black operations to go out and steal the other guys'
hardware and keys and yellow-sticky-notes and crack their OSs.
In some contexts, especially real people's contexts,
your PC may be a fine place to run the encryption,
but in an NSA / DoD context, especially when there's a war on,
the safest way to manage many of these things is to use
dedicated tamper-resistant hardware with the users on one side
and the communication network on the other, where
you don't have to worry about the user virusing their PC
or using their girlfriend's name as the new password every other week,
because it's in a black box that just works (or just works
if you have the right key token and the right PIN.)
EMP hardening has the pleasant side effect that it generally
provides TEMPEST quieting/shielding as well.
Also, in military environments, using special hardware instead of
crypto software running on vanilla PCs is that rampant theft
_is_ a problem, but that supply sergeant who'd be happy to requisition that PC for use in more remunerative environments
isn't going to steal and sell the crypto bump-in-the-wire box;
it's bad enough to lose any classified or sensitive information
that was on the PC without also losing the encryption/signature keys.

A Leyden Jar _IS_ a capacitor, which _IS_ a mechanism to hold charge.
Capacitors don't have to come from a factory in plastic or ceramic packaging;
they're simply two (or more) conductive surfaces separated by insulation;
that insulation can be air (or probably even vacuum), though there are
much better insulators around, which commercial capacitors normally use.

A while back I stopped wearing a wristwatch because I was normally
carrying about 5 things that did or should know what time it was,
between pagers, cellphone, etc.  IP is less likely, but maybe it'll happen.
There's no reason to assume the IP devices are transmit-connected
to the outside world; if you've wearing or carrying multiple devices
that talk two each other, and CPU is nearly free, might as well
put a Layer 3 protocol on them as well as Layer 1 and Layer 2,
so your Gargoyle-Vision eyeglasses and left or right earpieces can operate
independently and wireless, regardless of whether you're carrying
the backpack microCray or just one or more of the beltpack or
pocketsized WhereAmIGPS receiver, VoicePDA, Sony WalkPerson, more flexible hearing aid, 1-way pager, or broadcast news receiver,
all of which can be smaller and more convenient because they
share the same output displays rather than each having their own,
as well as having the two-way IPcellphone, shoephone, email, and web,
and the one-or-two-way pickup of data feeds from museums, data-billboards, traffic reports, sidewalk-toll-collection, and air tax.
But even the two-way devices don't _have_ to support tracking you -
some of the Mobile IP protocols are better at that than others,
so the Feds may know that somebody with a DHCP address is tunneled
into the microcell on the streetcorner, but not who, or alternatively
they may be able to see the outside of the tunnel to trace you
but not see the insides.  After all, the military's happy to develop
location-hiding protocols, like onion routing, even if the FBI
and other parts of the military want traceability and eavesdropping.
If that's Eric Blossom's company, Altavista should know where to find it.

There are some versions that have features allowing you to encrypt

Is this a religious argument?  I think he said it was copyrighted freeware,
so use it and leave the copyright notices in and you're ok.
Bad Assumption.  The memory requirements are whatever you want;
if you're storing a few private keys, or intermediate calculation results,
the requirements are very small; if you're storing 16MB databases,
they're much larger.  For today, 16MB seems large enough that
I'd think you'd use a crypto-disk or instead of nailing it into RAM,
but the boundaries between huge, routine, and small keep moving
in this business, so maybe you do now, and you will soon enough.
Does anybody know if Win95/98 keeps RAMdisks in RAM, or swaps them
out to real disk along with other least-recently-used data?
Since I've got 48MB RAM on my laptop, I keep a 2MB RAMdisk around
for PGP decrypts, and for temporary storage of things like
emailed ZIP files.  That's a good question.  My guess is that it's probably 0-2KB,
plus however big the drivers are, might be as big as 64KB,
but presumably isn't 1MB.  In other words, too small to worry about
on recent machines, where an extra 16MB RAM costs $10,
but if you're using that spare 4MB 386 as a remailer,
you've got to be more careful.
On the other hand, if the driver does anything for real-mode DOS processes
running on top of Windows, it wouldn't surprise me if you've
got to nail down 640KB while they're running?
But you knew that job was clunky when you took it.

The most recent amendment (27th?) sat around for nearly 200 years

The power to specify a time limit doesn't need separate mention; the time limit is either part of the proposed amendment, or it isn't, and it's part of the negotiations for getting Congress to pass it.
The more dangerous problem is that people keep suggesting a Constitutional Convention, which has basically no limits on its scope
(especially given the one previous precedent, which substantially
increased Federal power beyond the limits of the Articles,
and didn't require unanimous consent to adopt its product,
though the Articles required it for changing them.)
Even if the states _say_ they're limiting their delegation to
specific tasks, that doesn't mean the ConCon won't exceed them,

Don't expect the 2nd, 9th, or 10th amendments to survive a ConCon at all,

Electronic commerce: Commission proposes legal framework
A proposal for a Directive to establish a coherent legal framework for the
development of electronic commerce within the Single Market has been put
forward by the European Commission. The proposed Directive would ensure
that information society services benefit from the Single Market principles
of free movement of services and freedom of establishment and could provide
their services throughout the European Union (EU) if they comply with the
law in their country of origin. Such services are defined as those provided
normally against remuneration, at a distance, by electronic means and in
response to the individual request of a customer. The proposed Directive
would establish specific harmonised rules only in those areas strictly
necessary to ensure that businesses and citizens could supply and receive
information society services throughout the EU, irrespective of frontiers.
These areas include definition of where operators are established,
electronic contracts, liability of intermediaries, dispute settlement and
role of national authorities. In other areas the Directive would build on
existing EU instruments which provide for harmonisation or on mutual
recognition of national laws. The Directive would apply only to service
providers established within the EU and not those established outside.
"The Single Market's legal framework, combined with the single currency,
provide the European Union with a unique opportunity to facilitate the
development of electronic commerce", commented Single Market Commissioner
Mario Monti. "Electronic commerce adds a new dimension to the Single Market
for consumers in terms of easier access to goods and services of better
quality and at lower prices. Electronic commerce will promote trade,
stimulate innovation and competitiveness and create sustainable jobs. This
proposal should ensure that the Union reaps the full benefits of electronic
commerce by boosting consumer confidence and giving operators legal
certainty, without excessive red tape."
The global electronic commerce market is growing extremely fast and could
be worth ECU 200 billion by the year 2000. Worldwide, 86 million people
were connected to the Internet by the end of 1996 and by 2000, this is
expected to reach 250 million individuals. Within the EU, it is estimated
that more than 400,000 jobs related to the information society were created
between 1995 and 1997 and that one in four news jobs is derived from these
The proposal for a Directive, which was foreseen in the Commission's April
1997 electronic commerce Communication (see IP/97/313), covers all
information society services, both business to business and business to
consumer services, including services provided free of charge to the
recipient e.g. funded by advertising or sponsorship revenue and services
allowing for on-line electronic transactions such as interactive
teleshopping of goods and services and on-line shopping malls. Examples of
sectors and activities covered include on-line newspapers, on-line
data-bases, on-line financial services, on-line professional services (such
as lawyers, doctors, accountants, estate agents), on-line entertainment
services such as video on demand, on-line direct marketing and advertising
and services providing access to the World Wide Web.
The proposal would define the place of establishment as the place where an
operator actually pursues an economic activity through a fixed
establishment, irrespective of where websites or servers are situated or
where the operator may have a mail box. This definition is in line with the
principles established by the EU Treaty (Article 52) and the case law of
the European Court of Justice. Such a definition would remove current legal
uncertainty and ensure that operators could not evade supervision, as they
would be subject to supervision in the Member State where they were
established. The proposal would prohibit Member States from imposing
special authorisation schemes for information society services which are
not applied to the same services provided by other means. It would also
require Member States to oblige information society service providers to
make available to customers and competent authorities in an easily
accessible and permanent form basic information concerning their activities
(name, address, e-mail address, trade register number, professional
authorisation and membership of professional bodies where applicable, VAT
On-line contracts
For electronic commerce to develop its full potential, it must be possible
for contracts to be concluded on-line unrestricted by inappropriate rules
(such as a requirement that contracts be drawn up on paper). The proposal
would therefore oblige Member States to adjust their national legislation
to remove any prohibitions or restrictions on the use of electronic media
for concluding contracts. In addition, the proposal would ensure legal
security by clarifying in certain cases the moment of conclusion of the
contract, whilst fully respecting contractual freedom. These provisions
would complement the proposal for a Directive on electronic signatures (see
Liability of intermediaries
To facilitate electronic commerce, it is necessary to clarify the
responsibility of on-line service providers for transmitting and storing
information from third party (i.e. when service providers act as
To eliminate existing legal uncertainties and to avoid divergent approaches
at Member State level, the proposal would establish an exemption from
liability for intermediaries where they play a passive role as a "mere
conduit" of information from third parties and limit service providers'
liability for other "intermediary" activities such as the storage of
information. The proposal strikes a careful balance between the different
interests involved in order to stimulate co-operation between different
parties and so reduce the risk of illegal activity on-line.
Commercial communications
Commercial communications such as advertising and direct marketing, which
are an essential part of most electronic commerce services, would be
subject to clearly defined rules under the proposed Directive. The proposal
defines what constitutes a commercial communication and makes it subject to
certain transparency requirements to ensure consumer confidence and fair
trading. In order to allow consumers to react more readily to harmful
intrusion, the proposal requires that commercial communications by e-mail
are clearly identifiable. In addition, for regulated professions (such as
lawyers or accountants), the proposal lays down the general principle that
the on-line provision of services is permitted and that national rules on
advertising shall not prevent professions from operating Web-sites.
However, these would have to respect certain rules of professional ethics
which should be reflected in codes of conduct to be drawn up by
professional associations.
Rather than inventing new rules, the proposal would seek to ensure that
existing EU and national legislation were effectively enforced. The
development of a genuine Single Market based on mutual confidence between
Member States - is stimulated by strengthening enforcement mechanisms. The
proposal would seek to do so by encouraging the development of codes of
conduct at EU level, by stimulating administrative co-operation between
Member States and by facilitating the setting up of effective, alternative
cross-border dispute settlement systems. The proposal would also require
Member States to provide for fast, efficient legal redress appropriate to
the on-line environment and to ensure that sanctions for violations of the
rules established under the Directive were effective, proportionate and
Mutual recognition/derogations
The proposed Directive would clarify that the Single Market principle of
mutual recognition of national laws and the principle of control in the
country of origin must be applied to information society services so that
such services provided from another Member State are not restricted for
reasons falling within the scope of the proposal which would not cover
taxation, personal data (the free movement of which is covered by Directive
95/46 see IP/98/925), the activities of notaries, representation and
defence of clients before a court, gambling activities. Furthermore, the
proposed Directive would not interfere with the application of the Brussels
Convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgements in
civil and commercial matters and the Rome Convention on the law applicable
to contractual obligations.
The proposed Directive would also allow Member States on a case by case
basis to impose restrictions on information society services supplied from
another Member State if necessary to protect the public interest on grounds
of protection of minors, the fight against hatred on grounds of race, sex,
religion or nationality, public health or security and consumer protection.
However, such restrictions would have to be proportionate to their stated
objective. Moreover, such restrictions could only be imposed (except in
cases of urgency) after:
*  the Member State where the service provider was established had been
asked to take adequate measures and failed to do so and
*  the intention to impose restrictions had been notified in advance to the
Commission and to the Member State where the service provider was
In cases of urgency, the reasons for the restrictions (and the urgency)
would have to be notified in the shortest possible time to the Commission
and to the Member State of the service provider. Where the Commission
considered proposed or actual restrictions were not justified, Member
States would be required to refrain from imposing them or urgently put an
end to them.
The proposal for a Directive on a legal framework for electronic commerce
will be forwarded to the European Parliament and the EU's Council of
Ministers for adoption under the co-decision procedure.

Yeah - it can be quite nice to do that, both for security and speed.
Hugh Daniel's done some work on making Unix run on systems with read-only root drives - there are some SCSI drives which support
read-only mode again, and there are PCMCIA flash cards which have
write-protect switches and look like disks to the OS, so you can set them up the way you want and then go to read-only.
Not as many choices if you're running Microsoftware instead
of an operating system, though PCs give you some way to fake things out.  You need to jumpstart the machine somehow, and unless you burn the OS into PROMs, the easiest way is disk drives.
On the other hand, if Win9X wants to swap something to disk,
and there's no disk there, it could get pretty grouchy.
A long time ago, when disks and memory were both more expensive,
one of the memory companies (Kingston?  EMC?) made some SCSI boxes
with lots of memory in them, so the operating system doesn't
need to know that it's silicon and not rotating metal.
They also had UPS battery backup in them.
FSCK sure goes faster when you don't need to wait for mechanicals.
Some PCMCIA memory cards today just look like more RAM;
others can look like disks.

Sure; it's only trying to do a limited scope of security protection.
Trying to protect an entire Win95/98 system is a much bigger job
(about like trying to keep water in an upside-down sieve :-)
Even running entirely in RAM doesn't prevent applications from
stealing keystroke, or stealing each others' RAM, or
crashing the graphics subsystem, or hosing the network.
Windows NT, under some limited circumstances, has been rated C2 Orange Book,
but that only means you can't steal most things without creating
a log file entry.   Don't expect Win95/98 to be something it's not.
Computer architecture is _always_ a technical and economic tradeoff.
Why not just run everything out of Level 1 Cache or registers?
Disk drive makers keep making faster, cheaper, bigger drives,
DRAM makers keep making DRAM faster, cheaper, and bigger,
blazingly-fast SRAM makers keep making SRAM blazinglyer,
in-between technology makers keep making flash ram and bubble memory
in-betweener, bus makers make busses faster, etc.,
and the whole mess keeps evolving together.
Back in the mid-80s, Princeton University got some SDI money for the
Massive Memory Machine Project, researching what you could do if
you had enough memory for anything you wanted.  Even with the
CS approaches of the time, you'd do a lot of things differently.
Their non-massive toy machine was a 1.5MIPS VAX with 128MB RAM -
which took 10 extension racks to hold all the RAM.
These days 128MB is cheap, as are 500 MIPS P2s, but 50GB of RAM
is still bigger than most machines' busses will hold,
and even 2GB of DRAM is a lot bigger and more power-hungry than
most laptops can really support, much less 2GB of fast SRAM.

Apache is the  server if you count by "web sites on the Internet".
Lots of web sites aren't on the Internet, but inside corporate nets,
which are more likely to be running commercial software, whether
commercial or NT, while people with home machines obviously prefer free.
But what if you count by "pages served per day"?  High-volume servers
are likely to run on bigger machines than low-volume servers,
so they're more likely to be running commercial Unix,
though some may be running on multi-Pentium systems with NT.

@_subject: propose: `cypherpunks license' (Re: Wanted: Twofish source code) 
- Cypherpunks want to maximize distribution and use of good crypto.
Access to source for any product you use is necessary, primarily so you can tell if it has backdoors, weak crypto,
bad implementations, known bugs, previously unknown bugs,
and similar problems that are easiest to detect when
lots of people look at the source code.  Secondarily, unencumbered source code is easier to include
in products, whether they're public-domain, commercial,
freeware, Genuinely RMS-Approved Free Software (r,tm,patpend),
careware, Greedy Hoardware, or whatever, 	and the easier some code is to include in a product,
the more likely it is to get used.  In particular, if using
some code requires paying money to its authors, that makes it
hard to include in low-priced products and harder in free products.
If using the code requires changing the user's business model,
it's less likely to get used, though the Library versions of
the GNU license are much easier to use than the full GNU Public Virus,
and almost anything is easier to use than Patented Algorithms
Only Licensable From David Chaum.
These two issues fit together - secret algorithms
and secret code lead to junk like MS PPTP or GSM A5 which
totally collapse when examined by professionals, and even
with available source, there are bugs that can hide for a long time,
so the more people checking out a system, the better.
Some cypherpunks produce mostly free or Free software, some sell theirs
for money while hoarding what they can, some work for tax-subsidized
universities where publishing work is critical.
- Open Source proponents differ on the tactics they think are most effective
in making it possible for anyone to use source, from PD to GNUware.
[We at the People's Front For Open Source don't believe in religious wars,
unlike those HERETICS over at the Open Source People's Front, who believe
that the best way to get everybody to open their source is to give away
good source code only to virtuous people who agree to give away _their_
source code under the same conditions, instead of giving it away
untainted by even the recognition of the sin of code hoarding like we do.:-]
To the extent that openness-promoting tactics interfere with use of good code,
they act against cypherpunk goals, though the same can be said about
license-revenue-promoting tactics and other attempts to control users.
Most of us in both overlapping camps disapprove of software patents, and patents has done almost as much as the NSA to impede crypto deployment, but there are some cypherpunks who have them, and some who believe that patent and copyright _have_ had their intended benefit, which is to encourage authors and inventors by
making it easier for them to make money from their work.
I had one interesting discussion with RMS in which we ended up agreeing
that if software patents only lasted 5 years instead of 20,
they'd still be bad but we could more or less live with them,
because that would reduce the extent to which they interfered with
programmers using techniques, whether the programmer was using
a published patented technique or had reinvented it independently
and missed it when doing literature searches before publishing.

Some of them insist on ideologic purity before working together

      WASHINGTON, DC--Contending that morse-coded descriptions of
improperly petticoated young ladies are undermining the morals of American
boys yet in short pants, U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-SC) proposed
legislation Monday banning telegraph porn.
      "My friends, this revolutionary new 'Tele-graph' technology, by which
messages are transmitted across vast distances via cable wire, is indeed a
wondrous device," Thurmond told fellow members of the Senate. "But certain
telegraphers--most corrupt and foul telegraphy men indeed--have debased Mr.
Morse's code by using its ingenious dots and dashes to transmit
porno-graphs describing flagrantly uncorseted womenfolk. I submit to you,
gentlemen, that laws be passed to prevent the tele-graph device from
becoming a machine of ill repute!"
      Thurmond's proposed legislation would establish stiff penalties for
the transmission of certain obscene words and phrases along Western Union's
telegram and telegraph wires, including "merry-widow," "bosom," and
"underthings," as well as prohibit the use of the word "legs" instead of
"limbs" when referring to the female anatomy. In certain contexts, the
words"disheveled" and "heaving" would also be regarded as violations of the
law, with perpetrators subject to fines of $50 or seven years hard labor on
the proposed trans-American steam railroad.
      "As our nation recovers from the depredations and ruin of the recent
War Of Northern Aggression, we must not permit the tele-graph to become the
Devil's instrument," said Thurmond, 95. "Mr. Morse's messaging device must
not be allowed to corrupt the hearts and minds of the Republic's youths!"

If you want code for DOS, remember that you can compile and run
C programs on DOS, and a bare-bones DES program that uses stdin and stdout
should do just fine.
For prime numbers, read some books!  Bruce Schneier's book is a good
place to start.  Also, look around on The standard approach to generating large prime numbers is to generate
large random odd numbers of the length you want and see if they're prime.
Actually proving primality is hard, but there are tests for "probable primes"
that appear to be independent - so you take the candidate numbers and
run 20 iterations of a test to get probability 2**-20 or 2**-40 of error.
Depending on speed of things, it's usually more efficient to run a sieve
to eliminate multiples of small primes (certainly 2,3,5,7, possibly many more)
since those tests are often faster than the probable primality testing.
If you want to _understand_ this stuff, as opposed to merely using it,
you'll need some math, specifically number theory dealing with primes
and modular arithmetic.  But start with Schneier.

The policeman's statement, if honest, implies that the system needs a real mugshot or more detailed set of pictures to work from, so they're going to start with feeding it the Usual Suspects,
for whom they can get good data for the system to search.
It probably also has capacity limitations, so they won't be searching
for everybody they have pictures of, just the most likely.
However, looking for more people doesn't take more cameras,
just more backend computers analyzing the video feeds,
so Moore's Law will increase analysis capacity rapidly,
though it will also make it cheap to put more cameras out there.
Software errors don't seem to be a major problem here - false negatives just mean they miss an opportunity to catch somebody, and
false positives mean the system says "Looks like Joe Suspect on Camera 3!" or
"Looks like Joe Suspect on Videotape 32674 at 23:10 entering the bank" - in either case, the police can then look at the picture and see if it is.
Of course, if you're Jack Suspect, misidentified as Joe Suspect,
the police _can_ break down your door at 6am, haul you in,
and later apologize by saying "Sorry, honest mistake, it was dark and
all you s look alike, but your Public Defender says it's
not you in the video so we'll let you go this time, even though you missed your parole office meeting because we had you in jail."
Ain't gonna happen - are you kidding?  If there is a ruling like that,
it'll be done in some way that restricts citizen rights rather than
expanding them, or expands police powers rather than restricting them.
It's already legal for cops to hang around street corners watching for suspicious activities or suspicious people, and all video recognition
technology does is increase their effectiveness and speed at doing things
they already are allowed to do.
Unfortunately, I'm being increasingly forced to take the David Brin position of
"Cameras are cheap, get used to it, just make sure we have more cameras
pointing at the cops than they have pointing at us, and make sure
the cameras the government has are citizen-accessible as well."

The big problem in the US isn't the government's failure to
tell big companies what protection to provide for their transactions -
it's their insistence on adding more and more requirements that businesses, especially banks, and local governments,

and creation of database systems that collect more information.
The most common are the requirement for SSNs as a tax-collection ID
for banks and employers, and the use of the SSN for Medicare
making it simplest for medical insurance companies to use it as an ID.
Then of course there's the near-universal requirement for
collecting SSNs in return for drivers' licenses,
and "deadbeat dad databases" that require employers to register new employees
in government databases, even those of us who are neither dads nor deadbeats.
Once all your transactions have personal identifiers on them,

@_subject: Using a password as a private key. 
--
James Donald's "Crypto Kong" system  does this.
It uses Diffie-Hellman and ElGamal crypto over Elliptic Curves,
so it can get away with relatively short keys, 240-255 bits.
The secret key is hashed from your passphrase (and/or a keyfile*) Your public key is generated from the secret key and a generator.
Because the public keys can be short, there are some real conveniences.
You don't need to distribute big clunky keys in a keyserver;
255 bits is just 43 characters of base-64, so you can put it in your mail signatures and on your business cards.
Kong takes an interesting approach to key certification and signatures -
it doesn't use the "True Name" model with a Certificate Authority Trusted Third Party Subject To Many Government Regulations certifying that
the person who has this key has that True Name.
Instead, you sign messages, and it keeps a database of signed messages from people,
and you can compare a message you have with a message you've received previously to see if it's signed by the same key, and you can send encrypted messages to the person who sent you a previous message.  If you want to do the equivalent of signing a key,
you just sign a message including someone else's message, maybe adding commentary (which is hard to do in PGP.)  Here's an example:
    	--
         Bob
         Alice
and you can go compare Alice's signature with the one
she gave you at the Prop 215 Bake Sale.
On the other hand, "work on another computer" is a dangerous phrase.
If it's another of _your_ computers, fine, but otherwise
how do you trust that the copy of Kong or PGP or whatever
you're running is the real thing, or that it's not saving your passphrase
from the keyboard driver, or all the usual threats.
Those threats are somewhat true with your own computer,
but there you not only have some control over the machine,
you know that if Bad Guys have cracked it, your data is hosed anyway :-)
[ * The Kong keyfile of might-as-well-be-random bits which gives you entropy, and makes the system usable in environments where passphrases aren't convenient,
such as unattended batch mail decryption done in remailers.

@_subject: don't use passwords as private keys (was Re: Using a password as a private key.) 
Forward secrecy for encryption keys is a really important technique;
as you say, nobody can go back later and force you to reveal the key.
Forward secrecy for signature keys is less useful (:-), since it means
that you can't later sign a document using an old key.  (Occasionally
this may be bad - e.g. court cases demonstrating you signed something -
but it also means nobody can forge an old signature of yours.)
In any Forward Secrecy environment, it tends to help to have multiple keys,
with a long-term key that's only used for signing short-term keys.
The classic example is Authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange,
with one-use session keyparts signed by your signature key
(ideally with the signatures passed inside the encrypted session
rather than beforehand in the clear.)  One difficulty is proving that you don't have a backup copy of the keyfile,
on tapes, or hidden, or printed on paper stuck in a desk drawer.
Proving that _you_ didn't make a copy is usually impossible,
and knowing whether somebody else has a copy of things is a problem
Ollie North has dealt with (:-) ; if you're running your own PC,
physically secure, then you're at least as secure as your network connections.
Another issue for Kong and other systems with keys made from a
passphrase and keyfile is whether to reuse either of them
in a forward secrecy environment.  It's sometimes convenient
to use the same passphrase and change keyfiles every cycle,
but that depends on your threat models.
If you're worried about RF noise, you have to assume the CPU or disk
is also radiating enough for the spooks.  On the other hand,
that video camera in the ceiling can watch your keystrokes,
but can't watch the CPU.  That's when the paranoids worry about
whether the KGB is sneaking in and copying their disk drive at night,
and they start getting encrypted file system software. :-)

Not per se, though there _is_ still one major restriction -
the Defense Department gets a crack at patent applications,
so if you try to patent a crypto algorithm or crypto phone,
they can seize and classify your patent application and
working materials, using the excuse of "national security".
There was a case in the late 70s where somebody tried to patent
a wimpy analog scrambler for CB radios, and got it seized,
and a number of patent applications that got delayed a long time.
The RSA and Diffie-Hellman algorithms were published first,
and then the patents applied for, which works in the US and Canada
but makes them unpatentable in much of the rest of the world.
Steve Bellovin also got lots of legal advice about what order
to submit his patent applications and academic papers to
avoid the risk of getting them stolen by the Feds.
Sure there are - my $150 cordless phone uses spread-spectrum,
partly for better sound quality, partly for better privacy,
and partly because it's simpler than picking individual channels.
I think it's probably the frequency-hopping form of spread-spectrum,
and the hopping speed is probably deliberately low because of
Federal pressure, but it's still reasonable voice privacy.
(And the digital phones that don't do spread-spectrum still advertise
using "digital" for privacy...)  My phone's a couple of years old;
you can probably get one for <$100 now.
Analog cell-phones aren't secure, but the digital cell-phones
on the market all provide cryptography for voice privacy,
though not all cellular service providers support it.
CDMA provides some inherent security, and it, TDMA, and GSM
all offer some encryption features - having prominent politicians
get caught talking to their girlfriends on their cellphones
has helped raise the awareness of privacy.
(The real price of a cell-phone in the US is hard to determine;
most range from about $100-700 without service activation,
and $0-400 with a service contract of typically 1 year.
But the low end's close to $99.)
The NSA and FBI did the best job of FUD they could arm-twisting the
US digital cellular standards committees into using wimpy encryption,
and GSM had its own set of wrangling that went on, producing a
primary algorithm that's weak, and a bunch of alternative algorithms
that are progressively weaker.  I probably couldn't break the GSM main code myself, but I know where to find people who can,

Over in Europe, prices are mostly about $1 -- per liter.
Back here in California, prices have been varying a lot, and
are generally higher in areas with lots of people, lots of money,
or lots of restrictions on gas stations.   Here in San Francisco,
it's about $1.30, and down in Silicon Valley it's mostly about
$1.20, with some cheaper stations and some more expensive.
We have different gas - for environmental reasons, they add
chemicals designed to pollute water and irritate people's lungs
(while reducing smog a bit.)
Those New Jersey prices, while lower than New York, are still
articifially high, since they're "full-service".  The People's Republic of New Jersey *knows* that regular untrained citizens

otherwise you'd be having frequent explosions at gasoline
stations like you do in the rest of the country.
Any time the legislature begins to suggest legalizing

they'd have to pay a lot more money to have gas pumped for them

We've got a somewhat related Cypherpunks problem,
which is PGP key signatures.  The traditional software
likes chains of less than 4 deep, yet the last time
I checked the key servers, there were chains as deep as 12-14, and most people seemed to be at least 6 signatures
away from Phil Zimmermann or Derek Atkins, who were the
centers of the list at the time.  (On the other hand, I suppose a lot of signatures between Joe Cypherpunk, Ivan Cypherpunk, T0T0M0nger, etc. could improve the averages :-)
The PGP Web of Trust key management tools have the
difficulty that they don't make it easy to decide which signatures on your key to export when giving someone
a key to sign or distributing a key to a key server.
You can manage this somewhat by creating different
name/key pairs for different uses, with your
key signed by venture capitalists and your
signed by your fellow activists, and trying to make
sure that people who attend meetings at the bank building
where you have your office digitally sign in with their
Respectable Software Developer or Free Speech Activist personnas,
and not with their
personnas that seem to overlap with the Respected Entrepreneur web....

WIRETAP DELAYED ï¿½ [New York Times, C14.] In a setback for the F.B.I., the Federal Communications Commission has given the telecommunications industry an additional 20 months to comply with a Federal law meant to bring law-enforcement surveillance into the
digital age. But in extending the deadline the commission deferred action on some of the most disputed facets of the issue, which has pitted
law-enforcement officials against telephone-equipment manufacturers, network-service providers and privacy-rights advocates. The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act was intended to address complaints by the F.B.I. and local law-enforcement agencies
that were rapidly losing their ability to conduct wiretaps and other forms of electronic surveillance in the face of modern digital and wireless communications networks. But industry groups had long warned that they would be unable to meet the approaching deadline for complying
with the law by installing the software and hardware that would allow for court-authorized surveillance on modern networks. The F.C.C. extended the deadline to June 30, 2000. "This ruling is really a prelude to the privacy fight," said James X. Dempsey, a telecommunications expert. "For now the commission has given itself and the industry some breathing room. They've said, 'Don't rush into these additional surveillance areas.'" The decision came in response to a request for a deadline extension that was filed in March in a joint petition by AT&T
Wireless Services, Lucent Technologies and Ericsson.

I think the something at the WH has pushed them off the edge. How much you want to bet that it gives a lot more information than just the item costs. It will be used to police obscenity laws and censorship laws before it is done.
Ira Magaziner, President Clinton's senior Internet advisor, has proposed a new plan for tracking and taxing goods sold over the Internet that would use electronic "resident cards" and private-sector escrow agents around the world. Consumers would obtain digital cash at banks that would allow merchants to identify which country the buyer is in, but would reveal no other personal information. Consumption taxes would then be calculated, collected, and placed with an escrow agent who would then funnel the money to the appropriate government. "Governments would get their money more quickly... they would get a higher compliance rate... and the system would be easier to police," says Mr. Magaziner. (Wall Street Journal 11 Sep 98)

INTERNET FEES CHARGED ï¿½ [New York Times, C5.] Ever since
April, when the Federal Communications Commission reported
to Congress that telephone calls made from one phone to
another using the Internet could become subject to network
access fees, the industry has been waiting for a test case.
BellSouth has now provided the test. The company has written
to a half-dozen Internet service providers in its region saying
that in November, BellSouth will start levying access fees for
voice conversations the Internet companies transmit. The fees
are the same sort that local phone companies like BellSouth
charge to AT&T and MCI for connecting calls to the local
network. Internet traffic has never been subject to such fees. But
the Internet telephony companies are not ready to give in. In
some ways, BellSouth's move may be largely symbolic, since
most Internet voice traffic so far involves attempts to avoid the
high charges for international long-distance calls, in which local
access fees are a relatively minor part of the price. And yet,
BellSouth is trying to close what many in the telephone industry
have seen as a loophole in networking pricing regulations. Bill Stewart, bill.stewart at pobox.com

Where do you live?  In the US, the Post Office has rules against
anybody running mailbox services without making sure that the
customers sign some forms - you not only have to acknowledge that
the Post Office doesn't forward first class mail addressed to
mailbox companies (semi-reasonable), but also (unreasonably)
demonstrate to the Post Office's satisfaction that you
really are the you living at some other location and you don't
mind having mail addressed to you sent to this mailbox.
Exactly what that means is up to the local Postmaster;
one town where I've rented a mailbox really doesn't care,
and another had a control freak Postmistress.
But if you live in California, it's worse.  There was a law passed
in about 1994 (AB185 or AB187?) that asserted that 1) Many businesses in California are run from mailboxes
2) Many businesses in California have committed fraud
3) Therefore, we'll force anybody who rents a mailbox,
The wording of the law was actually more blatantly annoying than that.
The exact amount of ID you have to produce is tied to the local
Post Office regulations, but also requires a picture ID.
The PO will accept major credit cards and SSN cards as ID,
and my mailbox vendor didn't really want either of those,
because she didn't want the liability of having private financial data
around in a file she has to keep readily accessible for inspection.
A year or two ago, California was also having problems with
women who were battered or otherwise trying to avoid violent
ex-husbands and ex-boyfriends being tracked to where they lived
through their mailbox addresses, and some legislator was pushing
a program that would get Certified Endangered Women a mailbox
using some kind of cutout program that would give them some privacy.
Would have made much more sense just to dump the recent law,
so everybody could have some privacy.

Monday 9/28/1998's San Mateo County Times had a really strong,
if slightly naive, editorial in favor of the First Amendment
protections on speech and the press.  Among other things,
it was quite positive about the fact that the Starr Report
was able to be widely published in spite of content that
would have been censored in the past, and that it would be hard to
imagine how we'd explain to future generations 25 or 50 years from now
that we'd covered up this important part of the historical record
just because its content was vulgar.  Heh.  Their heart's in the right place...
Thank you for Monday's great editorial supporting freedom of speech.
Unfortunately, it's a right preserved only by hard work, and getting recognition for all forms of speech beyond just ink on paper is an ongoing struggle.  Publishing the Starr Report on the Internet would have been illegal if the EFF, ACLU, and publishers hadn't challenged the "Communications Decency Act", which the Supreme Court threw out 9-0, and unlike Nixon's tapes, a few "Expletive Deleted"s can't clean up the Starr Report.
As your editorial says "it would be hard to imagine", but censors are still at it - a Congressional committee just passed a reworded version, hoping they can get away with "protecting minors" as a loophole. Some people contend that the First Amendment doesn't protect rude language, only political speech.   But if you oppose campaign finance limits, they'll contend that elections are too important to allow unregulated political speech on TV or newspapers.  And Joe Camel?  He's illegal too.
Meanwhile, the range of opinions on TV and radio is quite narrow - big corporations and government public broadcasting buy up the few TV licenses, while the FCC bans low-power broadcasters who can provide a diversity of opinion, and most cities grant monopolies on cable TV networks.
And FBI director Louis Freeh, in his push for expanded wiretaps, has been using Anti-Communist Cold War restrictions on exporting encryption software to keep foreigners and Americans from using tools that allow them to talk privately without censorship.
Eternal vigilance is still the price of liberty.

@_subject: Jury duty considered harmful, or at least rare 
An Anonymous College Student wants to be able to stay off jury duty,
and also complains that the system ties you up all day in court
even if you're not picked.  I've been called for jury duty in
three or four different counties, which had different approaches
to the jury selection and different levels of disrespect for the
time of potential jury pool members.  In Santa Clara County CA,
you're required to telephone into a badly organized recording
every day for a week to see if your number is up, and if
it does come up you need to go in, but otherwise not.
In Monmouth County NJ, you're called for a week, though they'll
let you go on Thursday afternoon if you haven't been picked
for a trial.  I played a lot of bridge that week....
In Middlesex County NJ, you and the lawyers all have to show up on Monday, and if they don't need you, you're done.
If you really want to both serve the public and get out of jury duty,
take a bunch of literature from the Fully Informed Jury Association
and start handing it out in the jury pool, explaining to people that
under the common law, juries have both the power and the moral obligation
to find people innocent if the law they're accused of is a bad law
or if the punishments are far out of proportion to the crime -
such as the fugitive slave laws of the 1800s or the alcohol and drug prohibitions of the 1900s, or hanging forgers in the 1800s or three strikes* for non-violent felons in the 1900s.  Yup.  Jury participation is critical for preserving a free society,
but you can't preserve freedom by forcing people to participate in things.
Unfortunately, to the extent that jury systems do allow people
who have better things to do with their time (like running businesses)
out of jury time, they tend to filter in favor of people who'll cooperate with what the government wants - like retired schoolteachers.
Also, jury selection processes tend to filter out people who
don't appear likely to do what the prosecution and/or defense tell them;
it's an interesting thing to watch.  And the prosecution and sometimes
the other jurors often get grouchy when some jurors aren't cooperative -
an engineering supervisor I once worked with was one of two jurors who
hung their jury be refusing to accept the contention that a Hispanic man
should be guilty of carrying drugs and drug paraphrenalia because the
airplane glue he'd bought at the hardware store was in a plastic bag
which he *obviously* intended to use for sniffing it with.  (And this was
in New Jersey, where's it's not even illegal to be Hispanic....)
Of course, they did get much less abuse than the friend of mine who
refused to convict someone for drug possession because the drug war is bogus...
he got yelled at a lot afterwards, but being a New Yorker he viewed that
as entertainment and returned fire in kind.

@_subject: New California Spam Law is Bullshit 
Yeah - they aren't totally evil bills, in the sense that one shouldn't
ascribe to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity,
but they're both pretty bad, as well as vague and unclear.
On the other hand, if you're not willing to go to Sacramento to help
them make sausages, the way the anti-spammers are, it's harder to
justify bitching about the quality of sausage they're shoving down your throat.
More precisely, Bowen's bad bill requires you to establish either a
toll-free number or sender-operated email address, and include on your
unsolicited commercial fax or email the toll-free number or an address to which the recipient can write or email.  Less precisely, it doesn't
say that the number has to be toll-free IN CALIFORNIA, or that you have to
answer calls to the phone number.
Both bills have serious problems with banning anonymity, and with clearly identifying when they apply, given the combinations of recipient, sender, recipient's ISP, recipient's email mailbox, sender's ISP, telecom provider, and probably other physical and corporate entities that can either be
inside or outside California - or both - with or without knowledge of the
sender, and with asserting jurisdiction over non-California-based senders,
and asserting that jurisdiction based on factors the sender may not know.
And then there's the lovely definition of "published" in one of the bills -
it applies if you violate the ISP's published anti-spamming policy.
They're (correctly) not required to _have_ an anti-spamming policy,
but if they have one, you're required to obey it if it's published,
either by putting it on their web page (pointed to from their home page),
or "available by mail for free on request".  Of course, if they don't
*have* a policy, they're under no obligation to send you a timely
printed version by snail-mail, so even leaving out the undue burden
of determining who a recipient's email provider and ISP are,
and determining whether they have an anti-spamming policy,
and what if means, you can't safely send your fine commercial
solicitation to lucky recipients whose ISPs *don't* have an anti-spam policy on their web page, because it might only be on paper.
On the other hand, you can send your spam from a spamhaus,
and if I read the bill correctly, the spamhaus is safe,
and probably the sender is also, especially if they're both
outside of California.  So it's not much protection against spammers.
(The language about policies of the recipient's ISP is vaguer,
and has more risk of legal weakness because there's no
legal contract between the sender and the recipient's ISP.)
Then of course, who really _sent_ the mail?  An anonymous user
of a spamhaus?  (That bad, bad person!)  What if he paid digicash,

Riad's latest message worked fine - it's the first time in a while I've seen
Mutt sending PGP-signed messages that were actually readable
with Eudora (in other words, they're Just Text,
not some kind of broken MIME attachment.)
Looks like you're using Mutt 1.2.5i.
What settings did you use for other parameters?
On my system, by the way, the previous message didn't launch MSWord;
it asked me what application to use to read the message
(and I told it Notepad, since I expected it to be text.)
Tim probably picked one the Evil Empire tool sometime in the past,

That sounds like a job for IPSEC.  All the packets are encrypted
at the IP level, though you can still tell the source and
destination of the outer packet, and you can tell the packet size,
so it's not a strict Pipenet substitute - if you see traffic from
A to B and same-sized traffic from B to C, you can guess that
B might have routed some packets from A to C.
But it still answers your basic request.

@_subject: Buying Mein Kampf via the Net 
I don't know if Australia's joined Berne (I assume yes) or how they've
implemented it.  Copyright laws, like most laws, only apply in whatever
jurisdiction the government that writes them can get away with enforcing them.
(For most countries, that's their national boundaries, plus occasionally
expatriate citizens; for some, it's quite a bit less :-)
Traditional Chinese copyright law only applied to civilization,
i.e. Chinese-language books written by Chinese; stuff written by
barbarians wasn't provided, so lots of my Taiwanese fellow students in college
had much lower-cost versions of US-written textbooks, and that tradition
was adapted to software on CD-ROMs at least until recently.
In the US, that doesn't really affect copyright - the US Constitution
doesn't go into any depth on the details of copyright law,
so the US Congress was perfectly free to replace the previous details with
Berne convention details.  The one arguable exception is that the Const.
authorizes grants of patents and copyrights for limited periods of time,
and the current definitions of "limited" for copyright keep getting stretched;
I think it's now "75 years after you're dead, or pretty much forever
if you're a corporation".  The general comment I've heard from lawyers
is that copyright lengths will keep getting extended indefinitely to prevent
Mickey Mouse's image from going off copyright.
No, but Congress does a pretty good job of passing Unconstitutional laws
already :-(
The treaty trick that's been going on, at least in the ReaganBushClinton
is for the administration to haggle other countries into a treaty or lower-status-than-treaty agreement about something obnoxious, like drugs laws or crypto export restrictions, then bully Congress into implementing legislation for it "because we've already negotiated it with our major partners".

The issue isn't whether jail or just extra charges are the
appropriate remedy for double-spending - it's that the
offline methods generally rely on encoding a user's name
in the coins so you can tell who did the double spending,
which not only adds a lot of administrative overhead but
requires that you have a system of identification of your users.
Some online methods also do the "identify and punish" approach;
others do the far simpler "first one to grab the money wins" approach
to double-spending, which is better for anonymity,
though it imposes different risks on the users.

You're incorrect.  The problem isn't GPG, it's the Mutt mailer.
Riad's using 1.2.5i, which almost did the right thing,
and he went to the trouble of hacking the program to fix it.
So now his messages are plaintext GPG or PGP in the message body,
which is what they should be.
I'm not sure if hacking was necessary - it looks like RGB on the linux-ipsec mailing list is getting the same effect,
(though perhaps he also hacked the source.)

@_subject: Mask Laws: About 5yr. log retention 
One of the reasons for mask laws is *specifically* veiled terrorists -
wearing white spook outfits.  The KKK is fortunately past its heyday,
and the more common police problems when they hold marches are
keeping the crowds from beating them up and unmasking them.
Another reason for such laws may be bank robbers and highwaymen,
but it's mostly the Klan.
I did hear there was a case in Detroit or somewhere about mask laws
being applied to veiled women, but the loophole to go for is the
First Amendment protections on religious freedom.
France, on the other hand, has had public schools ban girls from
wearing head coverings, primarily because they emphasize the
cultural differences.
I read an article a while back about how the black dress outfit
was becoming very common among Egyptian businesswomen.
Not because they were traditionalists, but because the alternative,
at least in Cairo, was that they were expected to dress
fashionably and expensively, even though Egyption salaries
for women haven't caught up with salaries for men,
and the black dress is cheap, often more comfortable, and has enough traditional support that nobody can argue.

There are lots.  Read Schneier, pick an algorithm,
and explain your selection to your professor.
Think about the security of the algorithm,
things you need to be careful of for using it securely,
the performance needs of the algorithm,
the capabilities of your DSP and programming environment
and the things you'll need to do to implement it.
How do you plan to exchange keys?  Are there algorithms
that are designed for that?  What weaknesses do they have?
How do you plan to test your system, to be sure the data
is really encrypted?
Also think about how you'll handle the voice itself.
What are your input formats?  What's your networking environment?
Do you need to do compression?  How much bandwidth will your network have?
How much computational ability does your DSP have?
Are there standard algorithm libraries available for your DSP,
or will you need to roll your own?  What constraints on voice quality do you have?

@_subject: Privacy is another victim of the war on (some) drugs 
It's pleasant to see the court doing the right thing on occasion.
The majority of non-drug-related wiretaps have been for gambling
investigations, another ban on consensual behavior which encourages police invasion of privacy because the participants don't
have an incentive to report violations.  Definitely not - the invasion of privacy engendered by taxation
far exceeds that from the War on Drugs.  It's primarily violation
of Fifth Amendment issues rather than Fourth Amendment,
and invades the individual's interactions with other people
rather than focusing on their state of mind and body,
but it's a much higher volume and much more pervasive invasion.
In particular, it leads to large databases of information on
individuals and businesses, requires businesses to maintain
their own large databases on individuals, and requires huge expenditures of effort on tracking and reducing taxes
by people who could otherwise be engaged in productive activities.
And the power to tax is used to extend government control
into areas that would otherwise not have legal justifications -
confiscatory marijuana taxes were the beginning of drug prohibition,
car taxes are used to require license plates and car registration which are then used to track and control people's movement.
Medical privacy has been largely eroded by government health care
insurance and regulations requiring common identifiers for databases
(SSNs) and centralized decision-making, and also by insurance
companies which are largely shaped by the taxation-driven
market for employer-provided medical insurance.
I'd attribute the correlation issues more to the rapidly decreasing
costs of computers and storage than to the communications capabilities.
They're obviously overlapping, but even clumsy systems like SNA
and magnetic tapes by overnight mail were sufficient for business information sharing to reach critical mass a decade ago,
before the internet explosion, and to some extent even in the 60s and 70s when our privacy was beginning to be bent, folded, spindled, and mutilated.  For example, credit-card transactions
and check scanning generally don't use the Internet -
check scanning is a computer/optics/storage problem, and modems or SNA networks are enough for credit cards,
and also for buying credit reports on customers.
The big differences the Internet has made, besides fueling the growth in computer power affordability, have been in reducing the costs of correlation by small organizations, allowing the decentralization of privacy invasion.  This will have a lot of unforeseen implications;
it may also have foreseen implications, with authors
such as Brin and Vinge exploring possibilities.
Hear, hear.

Of course, "Privacy Rightwingers" don't believe in real privacy either.
(You can't use the term "privacy rightists" to parallel "privacy leftists"
because it will be interpreted wrong, but "Privacy Rightwingers" is close.)
After all, the government ought to be able to poke into your business,
and tap your phone calls in traditional fashion, and keep track of your race,
and keep track of your nationality in case you might be a furriner,
and keep track of who lives where because there might be (gasp!)
unmarried persons of opposite sex sharing living quarters,
or otherwise shacking up.  Motels, too.   And anywhere Commies do anything.
They probably don't insist on violating your privacy in everything -
for instance there's no need to search people getting on airplanes,
because if everybody took handguns on planes they could shoot
any Commie hijackers trying to go to Cuba....
Then there's Barlow's definition of privacy in a small town
"where you don't need to use your turn signal because
everybody knows where you're going anyway."

@_subject: About 5yr. log retention  
That's one of the applications that Disappearing Ink's system is
designed for.  Email is stored in encrypted form, with the
decryption requiring an access key from Disappearing or
a similar corporate server, and the access key is regularly destroyed unless there's a specific order to retain it.
This doesn't stop you from saving the mail outside the system,
and it doesn't stop a court order from saying "keep all your current
and future email", but it means that routine mail is routinely deleted,
unless you go out of your way to move it to your CYA server
or your Keep_for_later_use storage.  But it substantially reduces the
risk of fishing expeditions going after everything you've
ever written and every backup tape you've got.
Does this integrate well with Microsoft Outlook Mail
gi-mongous undocumented-binary-format mailboxes?
(Actually, it probably does quite well - not clear if it works
well with the Exchange mail server, but MS already encourages
people to use binary proprietary attachments instead of inline text.
You do have to deal with the network firewall issue,
but I think they've got proxy capabilities.)

Of course they don't.  Carting stuff is a job for union workers,
so that's done by the General Services Administration, unless there's
some other local union contract that requires your city's workers to do it.
And deciding whether you own things or not is a long legal process,
as is identifying what things you might own that are somewhere else.
So instead they just have the aforementioned union or city workers
cart away everything you _have_, and cart back anything later determined
to belong to someone else, unless it looks suspictious, of course.

@_subject: This is why a free society is evil.  [Re: This is why 
... and Tim goes on to attribute this to lawsuits of types that he asserts wouldn't happen in a free society.
It's not that cut and dried - in a free society, solid contributors are often fired for non-economic reasons,
and one reason such people are _not_ fired is also fear of lawsuits.
Stupidity may be stupid, but it's not rare, and there are lots more opportunities for random decisions to get made.
One friend of mine was having lunch with her boss and a male coworker that she got along well with, (back in the 70s) and the boss asked if they were going out.  "No, Bob, Charlie and I are both gay";
she and her coworker were both fired that week.
It wouldn't happen today, at least here in San Francisco,
partly because of changing attitudes in society (or at least
because people got used to it), and partly because the boss
would worry about losing other productive workers or customers,
but also because the boss would get sued or harassed by _some_
city or state agency whose job is harassing businesses.
But there's much of the country where it could happen.
An employer might also be concerned about the effects of a hostile atmosphere on the productivity of other employees,
not just the lawsuitishness of those employees - in a free society you have more flexibility to make decisions
about how to handle situations.  Sometimes companies don't deal
with personnel-relationships problems until hit on the head
with a two-by-four made of compressed lawyers.

Jim said that Tim is entirely wrong, that in a free society

Also, Jim says that "Democratic theory demands that..."
Theories don't demand things, people do, but most people who
like democracy demand that whatever the majority wants, it gets.
(And some say, it ought to get it good and hard.)
Some theories about democracy say that this will always be good,
because most people are mostly good; some say that this will be
inherently right because it's what Da People want; some say that
it may not be all that good but you can do a lot worse with most
of the available alternatives, and that if you don't settle for that
the worse alternatives will take over.
Tim, on the other hand, believes that in a free society
that if you want to run a business you can (or at least you can try).
Jim repeatedly asserts that running a business is a privilege
that somebody, I guess Da Majority, graciously grants you,

It's a market thing, or as liberals would say, it's about sharing.
Power generation capacity on the West Coast normally balances between California air conditioning in the summer and Northwest heating in the winter, and if each area had enough
capacity for all its needs, the system would be way overbuilt.
I don't know if Northwesters are as aggressive Not In My Back Yarders
as Californians about building power plants, but it's much more
efficient to use a power grid.  Except, of course, when you
overload it and stress the capacity limits and have stuff catch
fire in the summer...

natural gas policies is supposed to be to say
"let the bastards freeze in the dark" :-)

Agent or Free Agent can be set to do this, and it may make sense

The binary program newsgroups are a good example of this -

If you have to worry about people installing keyboard logging
programs on your machine without your permission, either
- you're using a public shared machine at a coffeeshop or school
- you're using your employer's machine, and shouldn't do things
- you're using your employer's machine, and need a new employer
- you're using your employer's machine, and your employer has
- you're sharing your home machine with a teenager who runs
- you've got serious security problems of your own - - the paranoids really are out to get you.
For the shared-machine problem, don't use insecure machines
to do secure stuff.  Use disposable email accounts,
American Express one-shot credit card numbers,
and if you must log in to something, use one-time passwords
(either S/Key or SecureID tokens or some similar mechanism.)
There's been some work done on encryption programs that run
in hand-held computers, whether Palm Pilot things with displays
or JavaRings or smartcards without them.  Matt Blaze, Ian Goldberg,
and Martin Minow have done presentations on those topics.
I'll leave you to figure out employer problems,
and there are professionals who can help with paranoia,
as long as you get to them before the Feds get to you.
One approach for the teenager problem (or the related problem of
machines for lab use, especially firewall research)
is removable disk drives.  You can get disk drive drawers for
IDE/Ultra/DMA/etc for about $20, and spare disks are only $100 or so.
Keep a clean copy for installing software you trust,
password-protected-screensavered to reduce accidents,
and give the kid his own disk to play with,
plus teach him how to reinstall software from CD-ROM
when it gets trashed.  It's the computer equivalent of
buying a full-sized beater car for your kid to learn to drive in -
extra weight, airbags, and an exterior you don't care about dents in.
If the kid has his own machine, and you're sharing a network, that's more trouble.  You'll have to firewall your machine
off from the kid's, or at least mainly run the clean copy
disconnected from the net, and make sure the kid keeps
current virus protection installed and running.

@_subject: Crypto questions 
You don't want to be on the bleeding edge of cryptography;
you want to be on the calm, boring and stuffy edge.
The bleeding edge is for academic mathematicians,
not for people with high-importance security problems.
You might want to be on the bleeding edge of firewalling
and implementation - depends on your need for speed, number of locations you're supporting, and price-sensitivity.
Unbreakable algorithms are easy, and have been for years.
Triple DES or the newly certified Rijndael AES standard are both as strong as you need (if you're paranoid, stick to 3DES; Rijndael is newer, and while it's had just about everybody trying to crack it and survived, and the US NIST (and hence NSA) has certified it, newer isn't better in this business.)
RC4 with 128-bit keys is also strong enough, if it's been implemented properly; if applied wrong, it fails badly,
so make sure you're using a competent implementation.
For public-key cryptosystems, either RSA or the Elliptic-Curve systems
are strong enough, given sufficiently long keys, though the definition
of "long enough" has grown by a few bits since then.
1024-bit RSA is fine for anything not involving decades of time
or large numbers of dead bodies, but 2048 isn't hard either.
For implementation, if you don't _really_ know what you're doing,
and since you're asking about a good reading list, you don't,
if this is for your business, you need to *hire* *somebody*
who does know what they're doing, and you probably want them to buy
commercial products backed by businesses with some development capital
that will fix bugs and maintain stuff, and you need to look at the
security of your processes.  Because it doesn't matter how
unbreakable your algorithms are if some insider has access to the
router with the password written on a yellow sticky note,
or if somebody can mail you a Microsoft Loves You virus
that forwards your email inbox to kgb.com.
At first glance, it sounds like your application probably calls for
either Cisco routers using their IPSEC features (if your remote
endpoints are big enough to use a router), or a Nortel or Cisco
IPSEC box at your headquarters location with IPSEC client software
running on your PCs or Linux boxes.  But you haven't talked about
network scale, speeds, sizes, number of locations, etc.,
so those are just generic guesses.   Depending on what you're doing
(user population, turnover, employees vs. customers, etc.),
you may also want some kind of Public Key Infrastructure,
or that may just be a bunch of bogus hype irrelevant to your needs.
Another possible approach is PGP-encrypted email -
PGP Inc. used to do gateway boxes that could forward and encrypt mail
and enforce encryption policies; if they still do this,
that may also be an answer.  You could also see if SSH has anything to offer.
The classic reading list on crypto starts with Bruce Schneier's
Applied Cryptography, plus however much of it's 1000+ item bibliography
makes sense for you.

Total Telecom is a free (registration-probably-required) news-clipping

FBI's current hypocritical pretenses of protecting "national security"
and "privacy" by increasing their wiretapping abilities,

U.S. works out security issues with VoiceStream & DT By Jeremy Pelofsky, Reuters
20 December 2000
U.S. law enforcement authorities are working to address national security
about acquisitions of VoiceStream Wireless Corp. and Powertel Inc. by Deutsche
Telekom AG , which is partially owned by the German government.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the companies filed a joint petition made available on Tuesday asking the Federal Communications Commission,
which has to determine whether the combinations are in the public interest,
to hold off ruling until the parties reach an agreement.
VoiceStream , based in Bellevue, Wash., agreed to be acquired by the German
telecommunications giant earlier this year in a $34 billion deal. VoiceStream also agreed to acquire Powertel for about $6 billion in August.
Law enforcement agencies "have concerns that the merger could, absent an
appropriate agreement, impair the ability of authorized governmental agencies
in the U.S. to satisfy their obligations to preserve the national security,
enforce the laws and protect the public," according to the petition.
Germany's 44 percent stake in DT, which the government has pledged to divest,
has raised concerns among some in the U.S. Congress about the impact the
government backing could have on competition and U.S. national security.
The agencies are seeking assurances of the ability to conduct
lawfully-authorized electronic surveillance of domestic calls and
those that begin or end in the United States, the petition said,
a copy of which was filed with the FCC.
The FBI and U.S. Justice Department also said they are seeking to prevent
as well as detect foreign-based or other illegal surveillance that could
risk U.S. security and the privacy of the nation's telecommunications system.
"The parties are currently and in good faith working diligently working
toward such an agreement," the filing said.
A VoiceStream spokeswoman declined to comment on the petition.
The company in the past said it expected to have to address concerns raised by
U.S. law enforcement authorities but did not anticipate any problems
reaching an
The merged company would represent a "substantial U.S. wireless service
offering near nationwide personal communications service (PCS) coverage as
as in Europe using the global system for mobile communications standard (GSM),
according to the petition.
Sen. Ernest Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat, has urged the FCC to block
VoiceStream-DT deal because he says U.S. law prohibits a telecommunications
company that is more than 25 percent owned by a foreign government from
acquiring U.S. firms.

But it was only the right thing to do if your the spare machine
was roughly identical to the dead machine.  Fortunately,
Sun operating systems are pretty good at guessing hardware,
due to S-Bus self-identification and the relative consistency of hardware.  With diskful machines, you sometimes had to worry about
whether the spare machine had as much disk as the original, though diskless machines didn't have that problem.
Sometimes you'd get into trouble because the spare machine
had a wimpier graphics board than the dead machine,
and the graphics configs might be stored in the copy of the program
that was on the file server, but usually you were ok.
You could also get into trouble if Box A (now deceased) had Program A,
and Box B had Program B, so you couldn't move the prom from A into B
without making it unable to run Program B.
But of course, if you've got a $20,000 chip-design program,
and $5000 Sun workstations, it's more cost-effective to keep
spare workstations around than spare program licenses,
and _much_ more cost-effective to keep spare disk drives.

Most of us agree that this technology is Nasty Copy Protection
pushed by Nasty Software Hoarders opposed to Honest Open Source,
and by Nasty Music Hoarders who want us to Pay Per View for
music, videos, e-books, and other products that we've bought,
using them technical workarounds for activities that
would normally be covered by First Sale and Fair Use
and only be covered by the limited protections of copyright,
and they richly deserve to Die Like DIVX (remember DIVX?*)
and get rejected by the market like Lotus Copy Protection.
Much worse, these Mindshare Marketing Thugs are in league with
the sleazy DMCA-abusers who got a law written badly enough that
it not only directly confiscates the previous rights of
information consumers but goes far beyond that to criminalize people who are engaged in the legitimate activity
of seeing what it is they bought and using it in interesting ways.
The technical side is bad enough, but left to itself,
either Darwin would get them or they'd find a market that's
willing to be couch-potato consumers we can sneer at,
either of which are ok, while the legal side is outright evil.
But what happens if we look at this from a cypherpunks viewpoint?
Cypherpunks write code.  Nasty MusicHoarderPunks can too.
The right way to protect information isn't to write laws,
which are ineffective against crackers (whether government or
free-lance), usually contain loopholes for cops to abuse,
and can be changed if the government wants to -
it's to write code and algorithms and hardware designs
that actually protect the information.
That's what these guys are doing, and it's what we WANT them
to do, though we'd rather have them operate a gift economy,
the way the folk music profession did before it commercialized,
and the church music and hacking professions.
How do you build tools to protect information,
at a level of granularity that someone who'd
cracked root on a Unix box or bought or cracked User on a Windows box can't break into?  You use crypto to encrypt data,
with public-key algorithms to do appropriate parts in public,
use objects that maintain their own data and keys,
and maybe you build capability-based operating systems,
or partition functions into separate devices like smartcards
or intelligent peripherals to keep the private parts more isolated.
If you want to build a For Your Ears Only secure telephone,
it's much easier if you can ship an encrypted data stream
that only the recipient's headphone can decrypt.
And if you want a digital signature system that
can't easily be forged by FBI spook who shoulder-surfs
your passphrase, or want a digital payment system that
can't easily be ripped off by some online store clerk,
it's easier if you can use some hardware object in the process.
To a large extent, the threat models are critical to your security -
but if being overprotected doesn't interfere with regular use,
and doesn't interfere with the other protection you're building,
it's not a Bad Thing.   Of course, it cuts two ways -
if you're not a Good Guy building hardware protection against
virus crackers, but an NSA Spook building cracking tools
to workaround for the software protections, it's nice to get
down and dirty in the hardware and hire Chip-R-Us to include
an undocumented Export Chip Private Key instruction in addition
to the Export Chip Public Key instruction...
Music Hoarders have a somewhat harder problem, in that they
want to copy-protect information while providing near-identical
copies to large numbers of people, while you're more likely
to want to provide your personal transaction information or
private messages only to a small number of recipients -
but you may still want some kind of watermarking to identify
who sold your "private" information to somebody you didn't authorize.
As long as watermarking isn't seriously obnoxious, the fact
that different listeners hear slightly different versions
isn't that bad - listeners at a concert also hear different versions
depending on whether they're in the front row, the nosebleed seats,
or the Phil Zone, as well as how hard they've been dancing,
how bouncily the people in front are dancing, whether Jerry
forgot some of the words or had a magical guitar night that reminds
them of a previous concert, and how, umm, chemically enhanced they are :-)
Somebody allegedly wrote to RAH:
Intel and IBM know that Windows isn't going to protect their data -
if they want it protected, they'll have to work around it,
using techniques like CPUs, speakers, and disk drives that
share public keys and only pass encrypted data through the OS.

@_subject: That 70's Crypto Show (Scalability and Napster) 
Napster itself suffers from tragedy of the inadequate business model,
since it relies on centralized servers with no visible means of support (other than the "with 20 million users we should be able to get revenue _somewhere_") and a potential for
exponential growth in their legal costs if they get any revenue.
They do have a problem related to tragedy of the commons,
which is a need for servers that are bigger than the
biggest individual servers they currently support,
and a technology that doesn't scale as well as they'd like,
though some parts of it scale extremely well and the
next level of bottlenecks are still good enough for
pirating music, with users sharing music in communities of
a few hundred thousand, if not good enough for six billion users.
I suspect the next layer of scalability could be handled
adequately by some good engineering, though perhaps it needs
Real Computer Science, but without a good funding model
it's not likely to get done.   The current model does seem
to port well to the Open-Servers-Not-Run-By-Napster model -
volunteers can run medium-sized servers because the first level of scalability design was well done,
and as with Napster-run servers, it's close enough for
pirate music, though it doesn't let you find
everything on the distributed net.
Less Napster-like systems with decentralized servers
have to address scaling problems as well.
Some of them tie their metadata and their transmission methods
together closely; some split them apart better.
Gnutella sounds like it's in trouble - too much needs to
be online, and the original designs can't handle a large number
of requests if there are people with slow connections on the net.
It's kind of like tragedy of the commons where the commons is
small and everybody has to walk their sheep in single file,
so the slowest or dumbest sheep become a bottleneck for everyone else.
Freenet paid more attention to scaling in its design -
it's easy to retrieve stuff if you know where it is,
or to find stuff if it's relatively near you,
and it can cope with not being able to find everything -  On the other hand, it may be harder to find the stuff you want.
Some of this may be computer science, some is engineering,
some is just counting stuff :-)  Some problems, like scalability
or understanding don't-use-the-same-key-twice attacks on RC4,
are Science the first time you learn them, but they're just
engineering after a while, the way understanding the relationship
of the tensile strength of material to its molecular structure
is science, but designing a bridge so that it doesn't overstress
any of its beams is engineering, and taking occasional samples of bolts
and destructively testing them to make sure they've got the
tensile strength they're supposed to is engineering or maybe
just business practice (depending on whether you're doing it
to make sure your bridge will perform the way you want or
to make sure your suppliers aren't ripping you off.)

Tim's complained for a while that the cypherpunks meetings and
discussions have declined in quality, partly because we've
tended to rehash old material rather than doing new and interesting work, and partly because we've tended to have
fewer talks on new stuff people are doing and more on
some commercial business (maybe or maybe not run by cypherpunks)
doing their product or non-technical talks by EFF lawyer types.
While I'm not disagreeing with him here,
I think a lot of this is _precisely_ related to the movement
of crypto out of math and CS areas and into engineering.
Mojo Nation, for example, is partly interesting because it's not just Yet Another Encrypted Music Sharing Product - it's mixing the
crypto with economic models in ways that are intellectually complex,
even if they're somewhat at the hand-waving level
rather than highly precise.
Cool.  Are the proceedings on line anywhere?  (Or is it only
for people who know the secret keys...)
Arrgh!  Dave, just because nobody's known to have broken them
doesn't mean that nobody's succeeded in breaking them
(without us knowing they've succeeded), or that anybody's put serious effort into an attack.
The basic remailer network is known to be breakable by
anybody doing a thorough eavesdropping attack,
because you can learn a lot from message sizes.
Mixmasters are much safer, because message sizes are
constant (though message counts aren't), but it's not clear
whether they're good enough, given a good attack.
Pipenets are probably secure enough against most attacks,
but they're annoying economically - not surprising that
Zero Knowledge's initial service didn't fully implement them.
The reason remailers have been Good Enough so far
is that as far as we know, nobody's had the motivation
to do a proactive eavesdropping attack on them,
or a proactive deployment of untrustworthy remailers
the attacks have either been after-the-fact attempts to
get information that wasn't logged (they're strong enough
for that, if run by trustable people on uncracked machines), or proactive attempts to close the remailers
(many of those attacks have been successful.)
Small numbers of remailers (there are typically about 20)
aren't good enough to resist shutdown-forcing attacks.
The cool thing about Zero Knowledge was that they had a business model they thought could get large numbers of
service providers to support, which increases the security
against loss of individual remailers as well as reducing the likelihood of an individual remailer shutting down.

This is called hashing.  There are lots of ways to do this.
If you need cryptographic strength, use a cryptographically strong
hash function like SHA1 and keep 5 digits of output.
If you don't need cryptographic strength, use a CRC code
(Cyclic Redundancy Check). There are lots of books out there with theory or examples about
CRCs and cryptographic hashes.  The basic differences are
how easy it is to predict differences in the input given
different outputs - in cryptography you care about this being hard,
while for regular applications you just care that different inputs
usually give different outputs so everything's distributed evenly.

We need to be careful not to let GAKKers define our perspectives.
Locks-in-series is a much different problem than locks-in-parallel,
which is the usual GAK/CorporateGAK model.   (Or alternatively,
user-locks-in-parallel-with-(GAK-locks-in-series), so it takes two corporate officers to agree to eavesdrop.)
Locks-in-series are often are solutions to increasing privacy, not decreasing it.
For example, especially in the health care business,
current practice is that just about anybody can get at
all of customer data, and there's a real need for privacy
protection technology that puts stricter controls on people
getting at data they do or don't need to know.
In the US, where we don't have the benefit of Canadian Health Care (:-),
the US government's Medicare requirements and tax policies
have pushed insurance companies to use Social Security Numbers
as their customer-ID numbers, and pushed businesses to use
SSNs as their interface to the insurance companies,
and doctors to use SSNs since they need to deal with insurance.
Even locks-in-parallel on data can provide more privacy than
the current screen-doors-on-data level of protection.
In spite of the usual PR behaviour that has PR people vaguely
paraphrasing things that might have been technical concepts once,
there are times you *really* need to let the technical people
vet press releases before letting them out the door,
or the crypto or privacy people will ream you badly :-)

Fortunately, somebody got this to the right people at AT&T

whose name was on the contract and ask him to find the sales rep
who got fast-talked into signing that contract.  AT&T's privacy policies mean that we can't reveal information on our customers' networks, so it's the PR folks' problem

AT&T admits spam offense after contract exposed By Paul Festa
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
November 3, 2000, 9:30 a.m. PT update - AT&T acknowledged Thursday that it had violated its own spam policy by providing Web-hosting services to a
purported sender of unsolicited commercial email.
The admission came after an English anti-spam organization
publicly posted what it termed a "pink contract" between
AT&T and the alleged spammer, Nevada Hosting.
AT&T had been hosting the group's Web site. "This proves that AT&T knowingly does business with spammers and
shows that AT&T makes 'pink' contracts with known spammers to not
terminate the spammers' services," Steve Linford of The Spamhaus
Project wrote in an email interview. AT&T confirmed Thursday the authenticity of the contract and
said it had been discontinued. "That document represents an unauthorized revision to AT&T's standard contract and is in direct conflict with AT&T's anti-spamming policies,"
wrote AT&T representative Bill Hoffman. "The agreement has been
terminated, and the customer has been disconnected." AT&T's spam policy specifically rules out contracts like the
one it signed with Nevada Hosting. Nevada Hosting could not be reached for comment. Anti-spam groups have long suspected the existence of pink
contracts that allow spammers to promote their Web sites
provided they send their unsolicited emails through other
Internet service providers, according to Linford. The AT&T
contact confirmed those suspicions. The Spamhaus Project's success comes as anti-spam groups
increasingly bypass spammers themselves and instead target
those who facilitate the dissemination of unsolicited commercial email.
Those groups--mostly ISPs and server administrators--are
relatively few and are easier to hold accountable than spammers. Another such pressure group is the Mail Abuse Prevention System
(MAPS), which maintains the Realtime Blackhole List (RBL).
The MAPS RBL blacklists servers left open to abuse by spammers.
While the group's stated goal is to pressure server administrators
to close avenues for spammers, the MAPS RBL has weathered criticism
that it has limited effectiveness in actually blocking spam. The Spamhaus Project, based in London, positions itself as kind of
spam Purgatory on the way to the MAPS RBL. Spamhaus targets entities
that send spam with forged addresses and the ISPs that do business with them. "When it finds a 'stealth' spamming service, or an outfit
selling stealth spamware, The Spamhaus Project sends a notice
to the ISP and requests the service or site be terminated,"
Linford wrote. "Ninety-five percent of spam sites are terminated
this way, and those that aren't are then escalated to the MAPS RBL team. "MAPS are very much our heroes." AT&T representatives have taken to Internet discussion forums
in an attempt to placate spam foes and reassure them that the
company's stated anti-spam policy will be enforced in future contracts. "Our sales agents have been instructed as to the correct procedure
to follow and have been reminded of our existing anti-spamming policies,"
AT&T customer care manager Ed Kelley wrote in a posting to the
"news.admin.net-abuse.email" newsgroup. "AT&T is making every
effort to ensure that this does not occur again in the future." Bill Stewart, bill.stewart at pobox.com

Jim, you're misunderstanding the class NP, though you're
correct in not holding your breath.
It's not "all problems that can't be solved in polynomial time."
It's "all problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a
non-deterministic Turing machine."  A non-deterministic Turing machine is allowed to guess answers
(or at least, to guess a polynomial number of answers).
Answers to NP problems can be verified in polynomial time -
the hypothetical machine guesses the answer, and verifies it
in a polynomially bounded time.
There are lots of problems that are outside of NP - they're known
to take exponential amounts of time to solve, regardless of whether
you've got a NTM which can pull correct bits out of /dev/oracle.
There are also lots of problems for which the complexity is unknown,
such as factoring.  Until ~20 years ago, linear programming was
believed to be part of NP, but Karmarkar's algorithm (which I think
was based on Shor's work?) demonstrated a way to solve it in polynomial time,
though with an annoyingly large polynomial.
NP-complete problems are a certain set of problems for which it can
be proven that if you can solve one problem in that set in polynomial time,
you can use only polynomially more work to solve any other problem in that
Usually people reduce things to the Satisfiability problem,
though sometimes others are more convenient.
When I was studying complexity theory from Karp back in grad school,
one thing I didn't understand was the issue of whether there might be
other sets of problems that are similarly hard but not reducable to each other, e.g. a set NP1 of hard problems including satistiability,
Hamiltonian paths, etc., a set NP2 of hard problems including Foo and Bar
that are reducable to each other but haven't been proven to
solve or be solved by NP1 (or at least not both.)
Perhaps it's a definitional thing, or perhaps there are proofs that
were beyond the scope of a first-year grad course, or perhaps
the problems that appear to be that hard just keep turning out
to be members of the well-known NP-complete set, or perhaps
there was something obvious I was just missing...

No - it gives you a direct solution that takes exponential time,
because there are exponentially many answers the thing could guess,
each of which takes a polynomial time to validate.
The "then a miracle occurs" step is that the NTM guesses the
_correct_ answer - that's why it's hypothetical, rather than real.
The reason that it's interesting mathematics is partly that many
NP-complete problems, or NP problems in general, are useful or interesting
to mathematicians, and sometimes to real people as well (:-),
and that it tells us about the complexity of the problem, and about the difficulty of finding answers, and whether to go for
optimal solutions to the problems or to look for heuristics that give
pretty good answers most of the time.

Dave's right, Jim.  The NDTM obtains The Right Answer by using a process
you could call "guessing" or you could call "an oracle".  That's not
"Oracle" like "Larry Ellison telling you what you WILL buy next", it's
"Oracle" like "Stoned priestess telling you that if you attack today,
a great kingdom will fall", and the polynomial-time part is where
you crank that through and find out that yes, it's correct.
(Unfortunately it's *your* kingdom, but it's correct.)  The reason the NDTM is hypothetical is because always guessing the
right answer isn't a technology that's really available,
unless quantum computers can do that with a sufficently useful precision.
(Looks like QCs will at best guess the right answer some of the time,
not all the time, and you'll still have to check it.)
The NDTM doesn't allow the state to be both 0 and 1, it tells you which.
The DTM part verifies that the answer from the oracle is correct,
even though obtained by non-deterministic magic.

It's actually with no www.
You're still not getting what the non-deterministic Turing machine does.
The problem is structured as a decision-making problem, where an input is "accepted" if the Turing machine halts in an accept state, meaning the
set of input is a valid solution to the problem (sometimes leading to
ugly convoluted problem definitions if you're really trying to find an optimum
rather than a yes-no problem like a Hamiltonian or 3-SAT), or rejected if it halts in a rejection state (where the proposed answer is not a valid
solution), or doesn't halt (if it's an annoying problem+input.)
"An input is accepted if any move sequence leads to acceptance" means that
there's some collection of next states (bits of answer) that leads to the an accept state.  How do you know _which_ input value leads to acceptance?
That's the magic part.  If there are N bits of input, there are 2**N possible
move sequences, of which the existence of one correct sequence leads to
I don't think anybody's claimed that it has - the Satisfiability problem
and the subset 3-SAT problem don't deal with all Boolean problems,
just ones with a particular form.

@_subject: CDR: [Spam wars, continued...] 
I agree with Jim that anti-spam laws are bad in principle;
in practice they're usually worse :-)
Some kinds of cypherpunks technology don't involve the law; some do.  For instance, user-supplied filters can trigger libel laws
("Hey, your filter called me a SPAMMER!  I'll SUE!").
Carrier-end filters have a similar effect (I'm sure Jim would prefer
that any such filters be installed by the user, not the ISP,
even if they do get installed at the ISP's end of the wire.)
Either way, they're reputation servers of some sort.
But another set of cypherpunks technology is "the cure for bad speech is more speech" - responding to unwanted
streams of bits ("Buy our SPAM today") with equally unwanted bits
("Ping of Death", cracking, and other attacks.)  These tend to
violate ISP acceptable use policies a and occasionally laws.
But social contracts and economics are two sides of the same coin.
While the DoD-funded ARPANET policies against commercial speech were
censorship, the Usenet prevailing opposition to newsgroup spam was
a social-contract thing.  In many cases it's broken down,
except on moderated newsgroups, but a lot of it is still there.
And ISPs implement spam blocking not because they care
(some do, some don't, usually depending on pricing models),
but because their users keep telling them "Hey, I don't want spam."
And social-contract relationships between ISPs mean that
if you don't want somebody spamming your ISP, you don't spam theirs,
and if somebody keeps spamming you and your users don't want it,
you stop doing business with them.
But spam is one thing, and politically incorrect content is another.
Some ISPs have no-porn policies because they see a market for it,
but many have them because they don't want legal problems if some
prosecutor decides that they're selling obscenity in an election year.
And with others, it's a marketing / branding thing - so if you don't
like that kind of ISP, don't do business with them.
Open source technical standards doesn't have a lot of relationship to the spam problem.  They do mean that you can find and fix opportunities for spamming that are being abused, and that
spammers can find and exploit new opportunities.
Back to the 128K problem, with an ISDN line I agree it's nobody's business.
You're getting dedicated bandwidth to a router pool, and whether
you're on full time or not is strictly a pricing thing
(and you'll have a much different opinion depending on whether you're
charged by the minute or jsut flat rate.)
With cable modems, it's a bit different, because the technology is
very asymmetric.  IMHO, the carriers like Excite at Home are clueless and
annoying in their server policies - but it's partly because they don't
have consistent traffic management technology, and partly because
they can get rid of most of the problems by blocking web servers
and now Napster which tend to be resource hogs.
They'd rather be able to shut down users blindly if they have
performance problems rather than having to argue about your web server
using much less bandwidth than your "client" video-conference program,
even though the web server is a much more efficient way to display
your fish tank and coffee pot to the world.  Bill Stewart, bill.stewart at pobox.com

On the other hand, doing a bait&switch on closing times
is also going to affect the voting response, especially for people who work late or weird shifts and were planning to

Also, maybe Tim hasn't voted somewhere new in a while,
but this is a polling system run by government bureaucrats,
who have a level of enthusiasm and competence for providing
high-quality service for inner-city residents that's
_much_ different from the quality of service that they provide
for rich folks.   Sometimes the poll-workers can read and write,
and sometimes there are enough poll-workers,
and if there's a political machine around, they also know how to
count, and what they're counting, and for whom, and what things are important to count accurately, like money, and what things are not important to count accurately, like poor people's votes.
When things screw up in an overworked clerical environment,
they screw up badly.
Somebody I was talking to last night was at the polling place,
and the guy in front of her was trying to straighten out the
two registrations from the same address, one for John Doe, Democrat,
and one for John J. Doe, Republican (no, they weren't father and son,

1) The ballots that appear to have been misvoted, about 19000 of them,
disproportionately appear to have been for Gore, and not for Bush,
so it seriously biases the results in that district.
You could avoid this by voiding _all_ Presidential votes from the district.
2) The district itself is heavily Democrat, so voiding all their votes
doesn't fix the imbalance either.

[lots of good comments on causality....]
A few years ago, Christie Whitman was busy campaigning for governor of New Jersey, and didn't get back home to vote in
a school bond election.  It lost by one vote.
(On the other hand, the local district or state or somebody
ignored their loss in the election and sold the bonds anyway....)
The electoral college system means that in almost all states,
except the one or two with the middlest results,
a difference of a small number of votes doesn't change the outcome.
Usually even changing the outcome for a whole state doesn't
change the outcome of the election either, except a few big states.
In Florida, where the vote totals are close to equal,
a small number of changed votes could change the election.
Arguably, the votes on the 19000 spoiled ballots _have_ changed
the outcome of the election, because the vote went into the voting booth
saying "I'm voting for Gore", and the ballot counters tossed those votes
after they were made.
I agree that that's a strong point - if any of those 19000 voters
was confused, the time for them to raise the issue was at the poll.
If they _did_ ask "hey, this is confusing, how do I vote for Gore?"
at the polling place, and the poll workers told them what to do
and voided their ballots anyway, then they've got a cause of action.
If they didn't complain, it's much harder to argue.

To some extent that's true - but it's also a lot like blaming airplane accidents on pilot error when the
instrument panel is atrociously designed.
It's not just the pilot's fault. Of course, here, the problem happened because the ballot designers
were trying to make it Easier for the old folks.
There are two or three states where Gore won by a narrow margin over Bush
(typically about 48-49% of the total.)  Bush has hinted that if
the recount overturns this one, he'll push hard for recounts there,
which could get him the electoral votes he needs.
And so it begins....
On the other hand, if Bush squeaks by and wins this by 10 votes,
there'll be a LOT of pressure on the Bush electors to do the
honest thing, admit that Gore really won (because of the 19000 trashed Gore/Buchanan ballots), and vote for Gore.
It only takes 2.  And they don't even HAVE to be from Florida,
though those would be the most appropriate ones to fix it.

It's not.  It's part of the way the dns name resolver libraries

The Internet works on DNS name resolution and on IP addresses that are

they probably don't exactly *require* you not to also accept other formats,

Actually, "most" ISPs probably don't have more than two T3s or OC3s,
because most ISPs are the 5000+ little ones; many only have a few T1s.
But big ISPs are a different issue; any of the Tier 1 providers could
melt a Pentium box if they directed a moderate fraction
of their traffic at it.
The question is how the carnivores tell the ISP's network what
they're looking for, and how much cooperation they need from the ISP.
Most ISP traffic is probably web, not email, and the email that's
actually handled by ISPs (as opposed to just passing through)
is handled by big mail servers that could perhaps be told to
forward all mail for targeted accounts, since they need to do
that level of indentification to handle the mail in the first place.
For email, the big player is of course AOL, followed by
specialized mail providers like iname.com, and the portal sites like Excite, Yahoo, and Hotmail, and a few ISPs like Earthlink/Mindspring.
(The business has gotten sufficiently specialized that I'm not sure
how many of those sites really provide their own service rather than
outsourcing to specialists.)   As with big ISPs, if they cooperate,
the job's possible, and if they don't it's pretty intractable.
If you know your target's IP address, it's a lot simpler -
get the routing protocols to shove their traffic your way
by advertising routes using OSPF, BGP, or whatever.
They do have a nice _little_ network :-)  Actually, most of that fiber
isn't even lit yet, much less full, and much of their bandwidth isn't ISP traffic, it's private line sold to businesses or other ISPs.
The last AT&T marketing hype I saw placed us as  well behind UUNET.
The real bandwidth constraints are mainly the routers - most big ISPs
use Cisco 12000 GSRs or products from Juniper or other emerging competitors,
most of which like to call their products "terabit" routers
because they have reasonably large backplane capacity.
A totally different bandwidth segment is inside the big hosting centers -
Exodus, Globalcenter, etc.  Most of that's Gigabit Ether,
with various brands of switches and routers, and an amazing fraction
of their traffic stays in the building, between different colo customers.

before getting to the far more controversial valuable namespaces,
like .inc, .ltd/gmbh/sa, .mp3, .sex and .microsoft.
The limitations on the number of TLDs aren't particularly technical;
if you allow an infinite number of them, you replicate all the problems with .com under . , and don't have a level of indirection
available to fix them with.   It's worth going slowly.
The more important questions are the openness of the namespaces;
I'm glad that ICANN rejected the WHO's .health and Nader's .union,
because they allow political groups to decide who can join
based on their political correctness positions
(would WHO allow .accupuncture.health?  .joes-herbal-remedies.health?
.snakeoil.health?  .homeopathy.health?  Nader's group wouldn't allow a company-dominated union, and might even have trouble with the Wobblies.)
The $50K application fee was pure exploitation of their position;
I don't think they're making any excuses for that.
The big problem is that it limits the kinds of TLDs that can
be applied for to commercial players - experimental namespace use
like .geo is valuable, and hard to get funding for.
And like taxi monopoly medallions in New York City,
once you've charged somebody big money for their chance,
it's politically difficult to charge somebody else less or nothing later.

Steve, or whoever The Blue Writer is, says "Correction. He was declared the winner by the fact that he has received 271 of the needed 270 electoral votes."
Bush hasn't received them.  Not only have the Electors not voted yet,
but Florida hasn't selected their electors yet.  They're still
haggling about whether the votes should all be counted,
and the Republicans have done a good job of preventing any recounts from being finished (or used), to the extent of organizing
riots outside the Miami/Dade election office.
They're also trying to decide what to do about the 19000 double-punch ballots
(probably unfixable), and the 15000 absentee ballot applications that
were allegedly criminally altered by the Republicans
(10000 were voted for Bush, 5000 for Gore).
Then there were the 12000 mainly black voters whose registrations were
disqualified incorrectly because they were allegedly felons, based on a database provided by a company whose parent company gave a six-figure contribution to the Republican Party - about 8000 of those
people got back on the voter rolls, and probably not all of the
other 4000 would have voted, but they were much more likely to
have voted Democrat.
I'm not saying the double-punched ballots were Republican fraud;
it looks a lot more like Democrat incompetence in the ballot design,
though it's been suggested that they could also have been from
Democrat attempts at fraud (punch a spike through the Gore hole,
and it won't invalidate any ballots already marked for Gore,
but will invalidate any ballots voting for other candidates.)
The "bunch of elementary school kids had no trouble" press release
is fun, but bogus.  If the teacher had told the kids
"Vote for Gore and Lieberman" instead of "Vote for Gore",
they'd have been much more likely to make a mistake.

There are a few causes, some the fault of government, some not.
First of all, the weather here (and most of the California coast
south of here) is much better than inland - it's hard to freeze to death.
If you're going to be homeless, it's a lot better here than
New York or Wisconsin.  And the city's relatively tolerant of bums,
in spite of occasional mayoral progams to make them go away.
Another is the government's policy on mental health funding -
some years ago, they started dumping previously-government-funded
mental patients on the streets, even if they were somewhat crazy.
Then there's the price of black-market heroin - some of the homeless I know are drunks; others are junkies when they can
afford junk.  San Francisco housing is expensive enough even if
you're not spending your welfare check on the black market.
Then of course there's the problem that San Franciscans
don't like new buildings in their back yards, whether they're
businesses or houses, especially yuppie houses or
apartments for poor people.  And they don't like landlords,
so it's seldom worthwhile to go through the hassle and expense
of getting permits to build apartments that'll get rent-controlled.
So the price of existing housing goes through the roof,
and anybody in a rent-controlled place can't afford to move
to a non-rent-controlled place.  And business rents go way up,
so warehouses and other marginal buildings get replaced with condos,
and live-work spaces get used for offices instead of residences.
Meanwhile, of course, San Franciscans are Liberals who don't want
anybody living in substandard housing, so non-city-funded flophouses
tend to get closed down or remodeled into yuppie housing,
and small cheap crowded tenement housing isn't legal either.
It wasn't very good, but it was better than being on the streets.
Of course, some of the fires in local flophouses really _have_
been caused by smoking in bed, as opposed to creative avoidance
of laws against tearing down buildings to build better ones.

That's a remailer checking outgoing mail to be sure it's encrypted,
as well as checking incoming mail.
On incoming messages, it's easy to tell if it's encrypted to *you* -
decrypt it with your private keys, job's done.  If you don't recognize
the algorithm, the message wasn't for you.
Hmmm.  That's a more interesting problem - this does seem to have the
tradeoff that if you want to get messages sent to you using stego,
you shouldn't use a remailer that has a PGP-out-only policy.
On the other hand, mail from a known Cypherpunks Anonymous Secret
Message Remailer adds a certain amount of suspiciousness anyway.
You want to get your stego messages from "Fred's GIF-of-the-Day" or
"Pirate-Muzick-R-Us" or something that's a better cover story -
so make sure those sites accept incoming PGP mail.
If you can reliably find it, it's not very good stego :-)
Open source stego that's not key-based has inherent weaknesses -
the eavesdroppers can easily extract the message from the cover text,
so the message needs to be binary random-looking noise which
somewhat plausibly belongs in the message (e.g. low bits of sound samples.)

Doesn't work - many mail packages will encode non-printable characters

If you require PGP Encryption, you can look for the line.  That still gets you into trouble with MIME if you're not careful,
so either be careful or don't :-)
The only way you can really tell if something is encrypted
is for a human to look at it.  Otherwise people will figure out
that they can send messages saying But still, you can keep out all but really determined abusers,
and all but incredibly determined spammers.
(Even basic encryption will keep out almost all spammers.)
(You could check that the whole message follows PGP syntax,
but without knowing at least one decryption key you can't tell
if it's valid or if they wrote the abuse on top of an otherwise
syntactically correct encrypted message.)
If you want to get fancier, you can also limit destinations to known remailers
or to people who've replied to a "You have anonymous mail - return this cookie

The internal state of the PRNG is precisely the question.
In a PRNG-based cryptosystem, there are N bits of key,
and if you know them, you can crack the rest of the message.
There are a variety of attacks, including chosen plaintext,
chosen cyphertext, known plaintext, etc. that can tell you
different amounts of information about the key or message.
Some cryptosystems are quite strong, and make the work of guessing
the key based on known quantities too large to be solvable.
Others are quite weak, and mathematicians being the devious sorts
that they are, they can often find ways to exploit the weaknesses.
With a one-time pad, the state of the cryptosystem is as large
as the message itself - you've got one key bit applied independently
on each bit of message.  There is no state of the system that's
smaller than the message itself, and no way to tell if any bit you guess is valid or not, because there's one key bit that will
produce a 0 for it and one that produces a 1.

Interesting idea, but far more trouble and CPU than it's worth,

It's not going to stop all the harassers either,
just force them to be more clever, while slightly decreasing the
reliability of your remailer.  It's probably better to use
simple detection of encryption (look for the headers)
and put in your own Subject: and header lines advising the recipient

8-bit-alphabet plaintext looks like plaintext.
It's easier to recognize popular languages - short bunches of letters separated by spaces.  Less popular languages that use
8-bit alphabets still have easily detected statistics that
are much different from uniformly-distributed cyphertext.
Languages with N-byte characters are much harder -
you have to decide whether to look at Unicode,
(2-byte's bad enough; variable-byte is worse),
otherwise you'll get totally hosed on your chi-squares.
Things that start with popular magic numbers like gif89 also look like plaintext (though they may in fact be stego.)

That's not something the remailer should be doing - that's something
that the user sending the message should be doing.  If the remailer list shows what jurisdiction the remailer is in, that makes it easier for the user to determine,
but it's the user's choice.  Of course, if the remailer _always_ adds its own encrypt-and-mail hop,
sending to another remailer in another jurisdiction, that's transparent
to the user and a good thing (as long as it can avoid mail loops.)

While I'm not aware of many companies doing anything about it,
it's not really that tough - all of the algorithms had
relatively similar parameters and sizes and calling requirements, and they were required to provide reference editions.
So you should be able to write a couple of routines like
and plug in the reference editions with some format-munger glue.
Tuning the algorithms for your hardware and software environment is more work, and maybe you want to wait till there's a winner,
but you get to claim you were way ahead of the curve by
announcing support the day of the announcement...

There are better compression mechanisms available -
AT&T's a2bmusic compression system claimed to use about
half the bandwidth for equivalent audio quality,
by using better models of human hearing in their algorithms,
and I think SDMI and one of Sony's formats also do something like that.
The catch is that most of them also include copy protection systems,
with the attempted tradeoff of "better compression for copy protection"
and they haven't been able to overcome the popularity of MP3
(as much because of Napster as because of copy protection, I suspect.)
There are two ways to hide stego text in MP3 or JPEG.
One is before the compression - figure out the kind of sound/picture
data that will survive the compression mechanism, which is very hard, but more useful for watermarking.
The other is after the compression - where you have to
find methods that won't mess up the decompressed version,
which may be hard, but either you might not care about the
decompressed quality (depends on your threat model)
or there might be ways to encode stuff that's either
comment-like, so not decompressed at all, or only affects very small parts of the decompressed.

The point is that each message doesn't have decryptable cyphertext.
It only has a secret-share that no recipient can decode until they have enough shares of the same message,
even if the KGB rubber-hoses them, and the KGB cryptanalysts
won't be able to find anything more than random noise in the message
because with <K shares, that's all you can get.
Now random noise may also be suspicious, but it's less suspicious
than something that's got more structure to it.
Even if they do suspect the recipient and seize his computer,
they'll only get old messages, not the new partially-received ones.

Blind humans aren't always good at recognizing screen images.
Neural networks are good at recognizing things.
Sometimes more precisely defined algorithms are good too.
Some examples of recognition systems - you can look in the archives
for pointers to the UCBerkeley "Naked People Finder",
which does a reasonably accurate job of distinguishing whether
pictures on the internet contain naked people.  The people who
did the research on that also designed the "Incredible Horse Finder",
which identifies horse pictures on the net.
I remember that those systems did a lot of modelling;
I don't remember if they also did neural nets or not.
If they wanted to describe shapes of dogs and cats and differentiate between them, it would be relatively doable.
There's also a company out there that does "passfaces" -
they pop up 9 pictures of people's faces, and you identify
which one is in the set that's you password-equivalent.
They do about 4 rounds of this, with random sets of faces;
it's closer to a PIN than a real passphrase in strength,
because they thought that was enough for their problem space.
An interesting aspect of it is that humans are very good at
recognizing faces, but not usually that good at describing them,
so it's hard to give somebody else your passface set.

It was shredded into a couple of pieces, because the sync was hosed,

CONGRESS ADOPTS OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT
Congress yesterday approved the Intelligence Authorization Act for
FY 2001, including a provision that criminalizes the disclosure
of any information that the executive branch says is properly
It is a breathtaking removal of checks and balances on the
executive branch, and an undeserved endorsement of the highly
arbitrary national security classification system.  It is part
of the worst intelligence bill ever legislated, adopted by one
of the worst congresses in the country's history.
"This provision marks the first time that Congress has placed
the full force of criminal law behind the executive branch's
classification system," said Rep. Nancy Pelosi on the House
floor yesterday.
"This ... will create, make no mistake about it, with not one
day of hearings, without one moment of public debate, without
one witness, an official secrets act," said Rep. Bob Barr. "For
those who do not know what an official secrets act is, it is
something that we have never had in this country. It has been
broached many times, particularly in the Cold War era. But our
regard for constitutional civil liberties, our regard for the
first amendment ... has in every case in which an effort has been
made to enact an official secrets act beaten back those efforts."

you can probably make it work.  That's similar to what

That's unfortunately a potentially serious problem given current practice.
Most remailer keys are unsigned, or at best self-signed, so the only
way to know if a key is the real one is to compare it with the first announcement of the remailer on the remailer-operators list -
which as far as I know isn't archived anywhere.  *Sloppy* practice, and not hard to change if people wanted to.  And some remailers occasionally change their keys,
either for periodic hygiene or because they lost a disk drive,

technologies and mobility applications and services. Nortel Networks
strategy is to pursue an open standard and standards compliant universal
platform that will enable integration of best-in-class location determination
technologies. This will allow Nortel Networks to provide a fully tested and
integrated, carrier grade, end-to-end solution for location determination,
management and interface into value-added applications and services.
In a recent study, the Strategis Group projected a mobile location market
estimated at more than US$30 billion in 2005. "We are driving the evolution of a profitable, new high-performance Internet,"
said Alastair Westgarth, vice president, Wireless Internet, Nortel Networks.
"With this effort, CPS and Nortel Networks will be able to provide consumers
and businesses with speedy downloads of location-based services on mobile

@_subject: CDR: Re: Anonymous Remailers cpunk 
I've reordered several sections of the discussion.
Back tracing is only necessary if They weren't eavesdropping
in the first place.   Remember that the goal of remailers
is to prevent serious attackers from tracing traffic,
not just to prevent complainers from succeeding.
If you allow unencrypted incoming traffic, you lose.
If you allow unencrypted outgoing traffic, you also lose,
unless the destination is a public Usenet forwarder or something.
The only unencrypted email you should be delivering to
normal recipients is something like
Eric Hughes and Raph Levien did some work a few years ago
indicating that message sizes may be enough to analyze
traffic flows in a Type I remailer network anyway -
you need to go with Mixmaster or maybe even Pipenets for security.
Of course, no Bad Guy would *ever* think of eavesdropping the
PGP.com or MIT keyservers to do traffic analysis on key requests.
If the spammer can get a gateway to do the work of fetching keys
and encrypting messages for millions of spam targets,
the gateway is probably toast for a few weeks anyway.
Remember that the spammer has all the time they want for
pre-computation - they're only vulnerable once they start
sending out mass quantities of messages.
(On the other hand, what spammers do lack is clues and creativity.)
It used to be possible to extract keys from the PGP keyservers,
which meant that a low-tech spammer could nab 5-20000 email addresses
and a high-tech spammer could also nab that many crypto keys.
I've heard people say there are over a million keys in the current LDAP servers; I haven't explored whether it's easy to
bulk extract them (e.g. query on "email address includes '
If you wanted to build a custom crypto-spamware for this volume,
you've got a few advantages over vanilla PGP.
The bulk of the mail message is the same for everybody,
so there's no need to encrypt the body multiple times -
just encrypt it once and use the same symmetric key for each,
and only do the public-key part separately for each target.
If there are message parts that do change, e.g. the
encrypted part contains the "Request-Remailing-To: target37 at wherever.com"
and the remailer doesn't enforce encrypted-outgoing-only,
you can still make it work by exploiting CBC's self-synchronization.
Set up the message so the variable line is padded to a
whole number of cypher blocks (e.g. N*8 byte) ending with two of
whichever Carriage Return/Linefeed you need,
then two more blocks of disposable junk, then more real text
(again, probably starting with CR/LF), and the CBC will misdecrypt the
disposable blocks but sync up again afterwords.  Ugly, but shouldn't
be particularly destructive, if you can survive the occasional unprintables.
This lets you only do hard work for the public-key encryption
and the symmetric-key parts that surround it, without having
to do symmetric-key encryption on the whole message every time.
It's much tougher to pull this off for something
that needs to create good cyphertext as its output,
so it's much tougher to trick remailers with encrypted-outgoing-only.
You at least have to duplicate encryption for more PGP header,
but you might be able to get past it into the message body safely.
If you're doing a long spam, it may still be worthwhile,
though if all you're sending is two blinking multicolored lines of
you probably weren't creative enough to have done this much work :-)
There are two problems - spammers and harassers.   The prevalent cypherpunks remailer attitudes toward spammers
seems to be keeping them from overwhelming your resources
and making sure complaints about spam go to /dev/null or the
apology autoresponder instead of your real mailbox,
but more serious harassers can get you shut down faster.
A harassment apology autoresponder helps a bit,
but encrypted-only-outgoing radically reduces the threat,
and keeps most of the spammers abusing other people.
If you're running your own Tier 1 ISP, and you host Spamford,
you can become the next Dead AGIS, but it takes a *lot* of complaint.
If you're running your own small ISP, you're relatively safe,
but enough complaints can get your Tier 1 upstreams to drop you.
But if you're just a customer, your ISP may have some tolerance level
but a determined abuser can still get you shut down.
Middleman remailers don't get complaints except about resource utilization - Peter had addressed the issue that
exit remailers need some protection from spam complaints,
but for middle remailers you just don't need to worry.
(You still need encrypted outgoing for security,
but if your output only goes to remailers that enforce
encrypted incoming you don't need to implement anything yourself,
though it doesn't hurt you.)
PGP web of trust works fine, just a bit slower from there.

There are only so many spare ones of these in the universe.
Speed's a fuzzier issue - Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
limits how closely you can know the velocity and location simultaneously,
plus there are speed-of-light limits on how fast communications
between particles can occur, given that the distances are non-zero.
There have also been calculations on energy requirements for
computation (don't remember the rationale; probably in Schneier 2nd Ed.)
Quantum Black Magic may provide ways to cheat on this,
by creating a set of problems for which the waveform has a high probability of collapsing in the correct state.
(It's also possible to get wrong answers, but NP-hard problems are easy to verify quickly.)
However, extracting the result from the system requires
measuring to a precision corresponding to the number of bits
you're trying to extract from the system - I'm not convinced there's
a way to cheat Heisenberg, in which case you're limited to ~150 bits
(compared to the current resolution of ~5 bits :-)
There's no current mathematical proof that P!=NP, or that factoring is in the hard set of problems (unlike Linear Programming, which Karmarkar et al. showed
could be done in big-ugly-polynomial time, though
in practice the Simplex method almost always was fast enough.)
Also, most symmetric crypto is based on the principle that
it tweaks bits in sufficiently ugly ways that it breaks up any
more efficient cracking methods other than exponential brute force.
It is the other way around.  By showing that some known NP-complete
problem is reducible to Your Problem (using polynomial work), you've shown that any polynomial-time solution to Your Problem
solves the known NP-complete problem in (bigger) polynomial time,
and therefore solves all NP-complete problems.  To prove NP-completeness, you also have to prove that Your Problem is polynomial-time reducible to a (possibly different) known NP-complete problem (thence to all others).
(There are also variants like P-Space Completeness,
which came out after I left grad school, which are a bit broader
than NP-completeness.)
"NP-hard" is a fuzzy term - it includes NP-complete problems,
plus things that aren't formulated as decision problems
(like "find the optimum" as opposed to "determine whether X is optimum"),
and some people use the term for problems that are at least
as hard as NP-complete problems but might be also harder.
So they might count something that solves an NP-complete problem
without bothering to check if it's also reducible to an NP-complete
problem,  because they're satisfied with a result that says
"look, this is at least as hard as NP-complete,
so let's use some fast heuristics instead of going for the optimum."
No, that would be a *Great* *Thing* for academic crypto.
Think of all the brand new exciting research papers that could be
written, and all the searching for new problems that are hard enough,
and kicking holes in new snake oil, and loads of fun in general.
Particularly, anything that proved P=NP would provide lots of tools
for exploring the boundaries between NP-complete problems
and other currently-believed-hard problems such as factoring
(and discrete logarithms, and elliptical curve variations on them.)
We might find out that factoring is *harder* than NP-complete (:-),
though I don't expect that.  My own guesses are that of course P!=NP,
but factoring might not be as hard as NP-complete,
and in particular elliptical curves might or might not be safe
using far fewer bits than regular RSA or DH (though the EC math is
too deep for my current knowledge, so I'm just guessing.)
For *practical* crypto, it would be a major pain to lose factoring,
because most NP-complete problems (e.g. knapsack) don't have forms that
are cryptographically useful - knowing that the right key lets you
solve the problem in polynomial time doesn't mean that it's easy
for the user to *find* a key like that in polynomial time
except by using special subproblems that turn out not to need exponential
time to solve them.
So in practice, we'd have to go back to symmetric-key KDCs
(Key Distribution Centers, for systems like Kerberos),
and One-Time Pads for the really paranoid stuff
(like shipping around master keys for the KDCs) for high security,
plus medium security that's basically Highly Refined Snake Oil,
where the cracker only needs to do polynomially more work than
the users, so in practice it's good enough for your credit card number,
but not good enough to keep anti-government secrets away from the NSA
or secret-government-conspiracy secrets safe from Distributed.Net,
so the convenient stuff risks spy-vs-spy and angry-mobs-with-pitchforks
Also in practice, that kind of breakthrough isn't likely to mature
for at least a decade (between how long it takes for the hypothetical
breakthrough to occur and how long before the system really
takes to adapt to it), and even if we haven't had the
Great Mythical Nanotech Singularity by then, we'll have enough
computer power and miniaturization technology that it'll be much easier to steal keystrokes right off your keyboard and screen,
rather than cracking the crypto, close enough for government work,
so black bag jobs will be common and we'll be back to a spy-vs-spy game.

Yeah, right.    Writing to network administrators sometimes works,

they've got to keep switching their sucker-collection endpoints.
(Unfortunately, free email accounts make that pretty simple,

it's important to discourage new suckers from getting in the game.)
A more appropriate response would be to

Unfortunately, this is bad - the main impact of responding to
spammer's "remove me" or complaint email addresses is that it
confirms to the spammer that they had a valid address,
so they can reuse it or resell it.  So sending the list would
make it easier for the spammers to spam you directly.
There are more cypherpunkish approaches - the "teergrube" project
(go search for the FAQ) or similar trap servers can absorb infinite quantities of spam, v....e....r...y....s...l...o...w...l..y,
so you can reply with lots of "thank you" or "remove me" or
"yes, send me spam, please, please" mail from teergrubed addresses.

Vikings got there, and there's some DNA evidence that many of the

Both of those arguments are incorrect.
Anonymous has no business telling us how anarchic we can be :-)
If people want to voluntarily engage in hierarchical relationships,
that's still anarchy.  And you can still have leaders in anarchies -
it's just that if they screw up and find there's nobody following them
any more, they can't force their ex-followers to come back.
There are versions of anarchist theory that accept private property
and versions that don't, but both deal with types of "property"
that can be taken or protected by physical force.
"Intellectual Property" deals with the rather sillier concept
that some ideas belong to some people and it's ok for them to
hire guys in blue suits to beat up other people to protect it.
Crypto anarchy creates different kinds of protection mechanisms
for ideas, in ways that beating people up is neither necessary,
useful, or possible, so you can limit most of your transactions
to genuinely voluntary ones.  This isn't perfect either -
if somebody defrauds you, you can't sue them or beat them up,
because your only contacts are a bunch of bits on the net.
So reputations become important, and you've got to build more
incremental transaction mechanisms, and you've got different tradeoffs of risk versus cost (for instance, credit's hard to do.)
Crypto-anarchy isn't Sternerism or Kropotkinism.
It doesn't say anything about whether you maintain traditional hierarchical relationships with your wives, though it does give
you more options for sharing resources with people you like
(whether you consider those resources to be property or not.)
It doesn't mean that the government or mafia can't collect property taxes on your house - though it may mean they
collect them from the resident rather than the "owner",
and threaten to kick out the resident if they don't pay.
It also doesn't mean your mother or work krewe or syndicate or commune or wives can't tell you to clean the bathroom - but it gives you more options for who "owns" the house, and more options for paying somebody to clean it without the government taking a piece of the action.  James is right that getting rid of private property gives you
other problems, but he's wrong that this means one huge
centralized plan that rules everybody - such things are
typically very hard to enforce and maintain, even with
modern technology to make it easier.  You can, and do,
have lots of distributed economic decisionmaking even in most
totalitarian states, between black markets, Russian jokes about
"they pretend to pay us and we pretend we're working",
favors,  bribes, etc.  And there are socialist alternatives
like syndicates and small communes, and there are farming villages
or hunter-gatherer villages out in remote areas,
and lots of other alternative structures for societies
besides just propertarianism and totalitarianism.
Many of them don't work very well, or work fine but fall to
outside invaders, but that's a separate problem.

@_subject: CDR: Re: why should it be trusted? (insurance) 
So it's a clear call for charity.  Charity is a Good Thing.
Insurance works by letting people pool risks - most people in
an insurance plan pay more in premiums than they collect,
and a small number collect more, sometimes far more,
than they paid, and the participants consider it a good deal
because the potential costs they're risking are higher than
they can afford, compared to the guaranteed small loss of the premium.
Most health care "insurance" plans in the US aren't primarily
insurance - they're employer-paid benefit plans that cover
routine costs as well as covering premiums for shared risk.
Mixing the two systems leads to lots of policy confusion.
The tax advantages primarily come out of social policy
during the World War 2 government interference in the economy
and the industry and public attitudes gradually adapting to it.
The other cost advantage of employer-paid routine health costs
are that the employer may be able to negotiate a better price
by buying in large volume, whether directly or through
an insurance company that also negotiates better prices
by buying in large volume.   In return, there's the extra
cost of bureaucracy, though in much of the US, the
extra hostility of bureaucracy reduces use of the system :-)
Employers do also benefit from higher productivity of healthy workers with healthy families, and they need to do something
to manage the costs of care for work-related injuries.
Without massive employer-funded health care, most people
would be more likely to pay for their routine costs directly
and buy insurance for excessive costs.
Before the institutionalization of the insurance and banking
businesses a century ago, large numbers of Americans belonged
to mutual benevolence groups - unions, Masons, Moose Lodges,
farmers' granges, the Chinese Mutual Benevolence Association, and churches.
They provided a number of services to their members in addition
to social interaction, typically including money-lending
(new immigrant comes to the country, needs loan to start business)
and also help for sick and injured members and support for people who couldn't find work.  Medical costs themselves
don't really correspond, because medicine was different;
nursing was something your family or friends generally did,
and modern medicine hadn't quite emerged except for fixing some injuries.   The main exception was tuberculosis,
and TB sanatoriums were often run by fraternal organizations,
though some were government-funded.

Most advertising banners come from one of three sources -
- advertiser.com/whatever
- ads.website.com/whatever (IP address may belong to advertiser.com)
- website.com/whatever (website.com's IP address and CGI.)
The usual way banner-killers work is to recognize advertiser.com's name
and not download pages or accept cookies from there.
Some may be fancier and check the IP address as well as the name.
It's much harder to junkblock banners that are really on your site -
but that means that your advertiser needs to have a setup that lets you work that way, which most don't (partly for fraud prevention,
though I suppose it's less of an issue for clickthroughs.)
Others may look for banner-shaped things - that's hard to stop.
And then there are folks who turn off images entirely :-)
Your goal can probably be interpreted as "how to detect whether
a user downloaded my advertising banner before showing them real content?".
You can't keep them from seeing the text of your main page before they
download the banner, because that's what includes the call
for the banner image.  (You could do one of those initial pages
that flashes up briefly and then calls the real page, though.)
If your webserver is bright enough (or if you hack it enough yourself),
you could keep it from showing future images if the caller
hasn't read the image.  That's only possible if you know whether they've
downloaded your banner, which usually means that the banner
has to be hosted on your site rather than the advertiser's.
Lots of people turn off cookies - you'd mentioned the issue of
using cookies to tell if people have fetched your banner.
But even for people who accept cookies, the cookie protocols
will only let you fetch cookies with your second-level domain,
so you also need to use one of the banner locations with your domain.

BayFF Celebrates RSA Patent Expiration
Whit Diffie and Dave Del Torto Speak of RSA's Past and Future
WHO: Electronic Frontier Foundation, Whit Diffie, Dave Del Torto
and music by UKUSA from VirtualRecordings.com
WHAT: `BayFF' Meeting on RSA Patent Expiration
WHEN: Monday September 11th, 2000 at 7:30PM
WHERE: Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport
(650) 347-1234
Directions are forthcoming on the EFF website: In honor of its 10th Anniversary of defending civil liberties online, EFF
presents a series of monthly meetings to address important issues where
technology and policy collide. These meetings, entitled "BayFF,"
kicked off on July 10th and will continue throughout the year. The upcoming
BayFF features famed cryptographer Whitfield Diffie and MEconomy's Master of
Secrets, Dave Del Torto. They will help us celebrate the RSA patent's
expiration on September 20th, 2000. How will these changes effect the public
at large? What are the benefits? Are there any drawbacks?
Whitfield Diffie, who holds the position of Distinguished Engineer at Sun
Microsystems, is best known for his 1975 discovery of the concept of public
key cryptography, for which he was awarded a Doctorate in Technical Sciences
(Honoris Causa) by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in 1992. Diffie
received a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1965.
For a dozen years prior to assuming his present position in 1991, Diffie was
Manager of Secure Systems Research for Northern Telecom, functioning as the
center of expertise in advanced security technologies throughout the
corporation. Since 1993, Diffie has worked largely in public policy, in the
area of cryptography.
Dave Del Torto's career in Internet privacy and security started in
the late 1980s at the University of California at Berkeley, where he
was one of the original "Cypherpunks." He joined Pretty Good Privacy
Inc. (PGP) as a founding employee in 1996, and in 1997 was part of
the four-man team that published the entire PGP source code in 13
paper volumes, which resulted in the first legal international PGP
freeware (exports of 128-bit crypto have since been greatly deregulated).
He currently serves as the Executive Director of the CryptoRights Foundation
(a human rights security organization) and is the Chief Security Officer of
MEconomy, Inc., a privacy infomediary company based in San Francisco.

At 12:45 AM 9/7/00 -0400, Asymmetric wrote   :
Servers are the price of scalability.  The nice thing about ICQ
and similar instant messaging applications, unlike IRC,
is that the server only tracks who's on and where, and doesn't carry
the actual communication traffic between users.  Obviously this is
for one-to-one conversations between two users rather than IRC's
everybody-to-everybody model.  Another option in this space is the
everybody's-a-server model, like Usenet uses.
Servers also offer the benefit that it's harder to tell
who's talking to whom, unlike point-to-point conversations,
but they do cause risks from compromise and downtime.
That's a MAJOR downside.  Most operating system and programming environments
limit how many open TCP connections you can keep, typically <20,
so this limits the sizes of communities you can maintain.
Also, if you have TCP connections you need to write code to handle
having them go up and down at unplanned times,
while UDP just dribbles in.
On the other hand, TCP sessions are good for data transfer.
Voice over TCP is a sketchier issue - the problem is that
the best way to handle lost voice packets is just to ignore the noise,
as opposed to waiting for the retransmission to arrive and
speeding up or delaying talk until you've caught up.
Your issues about ECB mode with UDP are good, though.
The alternative is to use CBC mode and trash the next couple of packets
after the lost/damaged one - CBC does self-recover.
This is ok for voice; may or may not be for chat.
The rule of thumb is that you need at least twice as many bits of
DH as you need of secure session key for your application, and you need
at least as many bits of DH as you would need for RSA.
You wouldn't want to use fewer than 1024 bits of RSA these days,
so don't use fewer than 1024 bits of DH.  That's enough for multiple
128-bit keys.
There are various format proposals for turning the DH key into a session key,
like using Hash(DHKey,YourIP,TheirIP,maybe-a-counter-or-Salt).
4096 may be overkill, but it depends a lot on how often you'll be rekeying
and how long you're willing to watch the CPU crunch to set up a connection.
The bigger risk, though, is the quality of random numbers available for seeding your DH keys.  Don't even DREAM of using Delphi's builtins,
if it has them - go find good crypto-quality-randomness work to reuse,
unless you know you'll only run on Linux where there's /dev/random.
At least use sound-card noise or user-entered mouse tracks to help.
Lots of "secure" systems have been cracked by cracking their random seeds.
If you don't have any other keying mechanism, you need to worry about
man-in-the-middle attacks.  A simple approach is to use PGP public keys
to sign the keyparts; that lets you reuse all the PGP infrastructure.
There are alternatives, at least for voice, like reading the bits of the shared keys to each other.  See the PGPFONE docs for much discussion on user interfaces - and think about how much of their code you can rip
off\\\\\\ reuse.
Also read the Photuris internet drafts - there's a lot of experience
on denial-of-service attacks that they've incorporated,
and it doesn't take much work to prevent most of them.
Gak!  Don't do something that ugly.  There are lots of math libraries
such as the GMP Gnu Multiple Precision integer package.  Depending on how
Delphi feels about calling C routines, the most you should need to write
in assembler are some little wrappers to format the function calls,
and hopefully you don't need to do that.
Also, some versions of the RSAREF libraries had Diffie-Hellmann code in them,
as well as multiple-precision integers.
Other chat and messaging systems have been written.
Check out GALE at gale.org, and look through the Cypherpunks archives
for encrypted  IRC and DCC variants.  Don't let that stop you from coding,
but do steal code rather that writing from scratch when you can.
It's been high for years - thanks for adding Signal :-)
Listening in on cordless phones can be a legitimate cpunks kind of topic,
though it's been discussed in the past and this was probably just a troll
or a clueless newbie.  As far as giving people drugs, the standard
Cypherpunks approach is to say "That's a hardware problem" and then
discuss whose Palm-pilot digicash system you can use for payment, though there has also been crypto protocol work like
"The Cocaine Auction Protocol" on how suppliers and consumers can
find each other without interference by non-participants,
or building conferencing systems for ravers where the server operator
provably doesn't have anything subpoenable that would indicate which
chatters were discussing where to get drug X at event Y.
(There are also noisier Cypherpunks approaches to drugs, like saying
"Jim, yer off yer medication again" or "smells good, got any more?" or
"He's obviously smoking something *very* good and not sharing" or "No, in a geodesic gift economy you really *might not* charge for drugs." :-)

So does the proposed law require companies to pay GEMA
if they make or sell anything in this category?
If they don't pay, what happens?  Lawsuit?  Criminal prosecution?
I don't expect that US newspaper reporting gets the details precisely correct.
In the US, there are a couple of organizations, I think ASCAP and BMI,
that manage the intellectual property rights for most musicians.
If you play music on the radio or do other public performances,
you have to pay them their standard rates.  It's not mandatory -
there are non-ASCAP musicians, and radio stations (particularly
religious talk/music stations) that don't participate,
but if you play music from their members on the radio without
a license from them, they'll sue for copyright infringement.
(The main reason religious radio stations often don't use ASCAP
is that they're a niche market, but the payments to ASCAP
cover the whole market and are priced high enough that stations that don't play new commercial music
don't want to pay that much.  Of course, some of them just
don't like sex, drugs, and rock&roll :-)

PGP was of course designed for environments similar to this - people you've met in person introducing other people they've met in person,
particularly in the heavily infiltrated anti-nuke movement.
On the other hand, it was oriented towards True Names, where you're
usually pretty sure that if Bob signs a key for Carol who signs for Dave,
that you're really sending email to the Dave you thought you were sending
it to, though Dave may or may not be a Fed.

You can still do CBC with UDP.  You might want to look at hybrid solutions,
like basic connectivity and voice connections on UDP and separate TCP
for data transfer, though that may be more trouble than it's worth.
There are synchronization problems you can recover from and ones you can't.
You need to stay aligned on the encryption-block barrier, e.g. 64 bits for DES
or 128 bits for some other algorithms.  If you lose that, you're toast.
But if you always pad your packets to multiples of the block size,
you don't have a problem with UDP, since packets either arrive or don't.
So if you lose a packet, then you've toasted the first 16 bytes of the next,
but the rest of the packet and the rest of the conversation are ok.  With TCP, you don't lose packets, though you don't always have convenient mechanisms for keeping track of packet boundaries, but you're always going to write in block-size chunks anyway.
Any symmetric algorithm will have maxed out by 256 bits, and most by 128,
though you may want different keys for your two directions.
So generating the DH key with 1024 bits is probably enough,
though it doesn't hurt much to do 2048 or 4096 -
no need for separately generating a key and shipping it.
In particular, DH takes advantage of both machines' sources of randomness,
which is a major win over something generated by one end
unless you've got a good reason for it.
Sometimes Mallory _is_ your ISP - even without Carnivore.
Public key technology only needs one untampered data transfer to happen,
and PGP has a lot more infrastructure for that than trading PRNGs.
Signing DH keyparts is a job for public-key signatures.
By saying "I'm going to put this chat server on the Internet"....
Crypto has its own special denial-of-service flavors in addition to
the regular ones, and Photuris addresses a lot of it with minimal work.
The "Library GPL" was written to address just that problem.
Stallman calls it the "Lesser GPL", because he doesn't like it (:-),
but LGPL says you have to distribute source code for the LGPL'd libraries you use or modify (or indicate where to download them) but doesn't GPLize the
code you wrote that isn't part of the libraries.  So you can use it in
your proprietary product without publishing your code, charge money for it,

Not incorrect, but 2**256 possible keys gets you into age-of-the-universe territory for cracking.
I'm not aware of one.  IDEA's "non-commercial" definitions have gotten
fuzzier over the years, and it's patented in lots of places.
Avoid Misty.  Several of the AES candidates had policies of
"it's patented now but if we're the AES winner you can all use it for free",
which means you won't really know licensing issues until NIST picks a winner.

The Eudora PGP Plug-In deliberately decrypts received mail and stores it unencrypted, specifically to discourage the
"You must escrow your private keys so we can decode your plaintext"
attacks that the FBI/NSA/WhiteHouse anti-crypto mafia were pushing
a couple of years ago.  That's a different issue from storing your
mailbox in a PGPdisk volume or some other encrypted filesystem
or having the mail decryptor re-encrypt for storage with a different key
(which wouldn't be that hard, since you could use a different
public key to encrypt the session key and leave the symmetric-encrypted part of the message alone.)

@_subject: CDR: Aryan Nations incident - Re: And you thought Nazi agitprop was 
It's not a "deep pockets" thing, it's a "shallow pockets" thing.
Deep pockets cases are where you want the money, so you drag somebody
with lots of money into the case if you can.  In this case,
and Morris Dee's previous KKK case, the objective isn't *getting* money -
it's *taking away* all the money the bastards have to put them out of
and then twisting the knife and rubbing salt in the wounds by
using their former Bad White Boys playground for something they dislike.
If they had deep pockets, this would be hard.  But soft targets like the AN or KKK chapter don't have a lot of money,
so a lawsuit for shooting at people or beating them up can be enough
to bankrupt them, even if all you get is a couple of double-wides
on a hunk of scrubby land.  Also, they're less likely to have
good legal representation (at least these days - in the KKK's heyday
the town judge and lawyers might well have been members),
so they're easier to beat.
Also, this is rural Idaho - stunningly gorgeous country, where the
traditional way to relate to the wildlife involves firearms,
so even if she *had* been shooting her gun it'd've been pretty normal.
The newspaper reports didn't say whether the real bright Aryan boys
decided gunshots must have been an invading Jew army before
they saw that the car was full of white people, or whether they
at least looked at them enough to decide they weren't blacks or cops...

As Tim pointed out, they're not trying to force every cat herder
to provide a sample of cat hairs.  They're trying to get a reasonably broad spectrum of cat fur samples (about 1600),
so they can find the genetic differences between them,
which will make it easier to use cat hair as evidence,
or at least easier to tell whether it's usable.
It may be that they'll find that it's easy to tell that there's
a 90% or 99% or 99.99% chance that the cat hair found on the suspect was from the victim's cat Snowball as opposed to the suspect's cat Mehitabel,
or it may be they'll find that one white cat hair looks about like another.
Most cats have multiple colors of hair, so color alone isn't always
indicative, though I can usually tell which cat the cat hairs on my
computer keyboard are from.
As far as mandating hair samples goes, not that they're doing that,
if they can require you to get a license to possess a dog,
they could include hair samples as part of the process;
they could also require licenses for cats.
Actual genetic testing of millions of cat hair samples would be
prohibitively expensive, but storing samples for analyzing if
there's a specific need for it wouldn't be as difficult.
But it's still a big expense and hassle, and it'd be much
simpler to get a warrant and collect samples from the
victims' and suspects' houses or cats when needed.

Eudora has trouble with some of the MIME variants used by Mutt.
I don't know if that's because Mutt's outputting wrong formats,

And there's *lots* of other badly formatted mail out there,

If you do good bouncegrams when you reject incorrectly formatted mail,
the sender will probably retry, so occasional false positives
on mail from humans aren't a big problem, and of course bouncing
mail from spambots isn't a problem.  The worst case is when you
reject mail that was generated by a bot you actually *wanted*

@_subject: CDR: Why Free Speech Matters 
Jim, you've always come out strongly in favor of regulating
businesses that do things in ways you don't like,
and using government to do it rather than market forces.
That's  'freedom for me but not for thee', whether the
behavior in question is kissing people or selling them stuff.
The basic choices you have for regulating people's behavior
in society are talking to them, not talking to them,
or beating them up.  In most "civilized" societies,
beating people up is frowned on except when the government does it,
and governments provide lots of mechanisms for chicken out
before they have to resort to violence (doing what the business
regulators tell you to do, or paying the fine, or going to jail
peacefully instead of shooting your way out, but all of these are
things you do because the government will otherwise shoot you,
and periodically they hold a Waco to remind you that they will.)
In a more civilized society, whether it's an anarchy or just a
society where people ignore the police whenever possible,
that leaves you with ignoring people who do things you dislike,
or refusing to do business with them, or organizing boycotts,
or picketing or other forms of expressing your dislike for
how a person runs his business activities or non-business activities.
I think most of us agree that the ballpark acted like
major-league assholes, but that's a separate discussion.

@_subject: CDR: Re: Why Free Speech Matters 
I didn't see them, but I assume you define a public business as
one you want to be able to boss around, and a private business to be
one you don't care about bossing around?
There are several layers of activity and ownership in this ballpark case.
If the ballpark were owned and managed by an individual or partnership,
and the owner(s) told the women to leave, they've got a problem because
they sold them a ticket to the game.  On the other hand, the women could
have engaged in behavior that was sufficiently disruptive that throwing them out would have been appropriate (e.g. kissing on home plate
while the game was going on, instead of in the stands), and most courts
would side with the ballpark in that case.  However, the owners would
have the moral right to refuse to sell them tickets in the future -
that's part of the owners' personal freedom, just as either refusing
to watch ballgames at that stadium or leading a boycott
against major-league assholes is part of the women's personal freedom.
Whether the owners _should_ do something like that is a separate issue
(get real - that'd be inappropriate in Redneckville, let alone SF or LA).  But if it's their park, Darwin will take care of them.
Some liberals like Choate think that the public can't be trusted
_as individuals_ not to do business with bigots, so the public needs to hire legislators to harass bigots for them.  It's a mistake -
if the public are bigoted enough that that's a problem, they typically elect legislators who make laws mandating separate bathrooms for nonwhites
and separate but equal government-funded schools and
mandatory school uniforms and bans on gang colors or clan tartans, and
keeping colored immigants out of the country even if they're
refugees from US-funded military dictatorships.
The only time it's safe to trust the legislature with moral issues is after the people become moral, at which point you don't need legislation.
But the women weren't thrown out by the owner, they were thrown out
by an employee.  The owner has some responsibility for the employee's
actions, because the employee is acting for the owner, but unlike an owner, the employee has a responsibility not to be stupid.
(As noted above, stupid owners are at their own risk...)
The appropriate thing for the owner to do is damage control,
whether that's instituting sensitivity training for employees or
profuse apologies for the rude behavior of his ex-employee.
Presumably the employee acted because of a complaint from
other customers, rather than thinking it up on his own,
but he should have had the sense to do something else,
like offer the complainers or the lesbians a better seat,
or tell the complainers that yelling "Ewwww, Grossss!!!"
is annoying to the other customers and makes them look like rubes.
Corporations are a special case - almost everything is done by
employees, though some employees are also stockholders,
but unlike businesses operated by their owners,
they're a legal fiction created by the government,
so if the government wants to attach strings to the favors it grants,
they're not violating the rights of the recipients.
If the government bans or regulates businesses from operating except
in return for accepting the strings, that's a different problem,
and the favors that it grants may not be legitimate for it to grant,
but in general, if you don't like corporate regulations,
don't be a corporation, be a proprietor.
Most of this is moot in San Francisco - with Socialized Baseball,
the city government kicked in a lot of money to the ball teams
to help build the stadium and encourage the team to stay in town.
The whole thing's a crock, and the sports team have a great scam
going by threatening to leave town if they're not bribed to stay,
but the city should have some say over how the place is run
(regardless of whether the local version of the scam leaves them
owning the stadium like some cities or just lending to the team's
building project like other cities.)

There's not only no stipulation about whether you can afford counsel,
there's no stipulation about the government paying for counsel,
or about counsel having to be a licensed or trained attorney.
It only says you're allowed to HAVE counsel.
The business about the government paying for an attorney for you
is based on the Supreme Court's *interpretation* of this amendment
concluding that the right to bring counsel with you is pretty lame
if you can't afford to pay counsel, and that therefore the government
ought to pay for counsel for the indigent.
There's also no right to insist that the government provide you with
*good* counsel - public defenders have a reputation of providing
service quality similar to government-funded health care,
at best idealistic until they get too jaded, but the competent ones
are overworked to the point that you still don't get great support.
If you want to argue about assistance of counsel in cases like Jim Bell's,
you're better off trying to argue that counsel should "assist",
not "hinder", and that people who don't want the negative assistance of
counsel that doesn't do what they want should be allowed to dump their PD,
not be told that only the PD and not they themselves have the right to speak.

Seth is a long-term contributor to the Cyberia-L list,
which a reasonable number of Cypherpunks also read
or at least occasionally post to, including Declan and JYA.
He's been a major contributor with The Censorware Project
(which I gather is a trying to restart after a previous
death-by-infighting that followed a few years of good work)
and is strongly in the anti-censorware camp as opposed to the
censorware-will-save-us-by-deflecting-worse-forms-of-censorship camp.
He does computer consulting (not sure what type),
and is one of the technologist/activist types on Cyberia-L
rather than one of the lawyers.
And yes, as some people have commented, he does flame against
Libertarianism, among other things, but he's also
a strong supporter of free speech.

Saturday April 7 Cypherpunks Meeting in San Francisco.
The meeting will be at Moscone Center North, in Room 122.
Go in the door, take the escalators downstairs.
We've been told that we shouldn't need badges to get to the room
(and they're still setting up the exhibit floor),
but if that turns out to be incorrect, check with the registration desk
and ask for Kellie.    Bill's cellphone is +1-415-307-7119,
but cellphone reception on Moscone is normally poor to non-existent :-)
This is the FIRST Saturday of the month, because the RSA conference will be
the following week and many usual suspects from out of town will be around.
The meeting will start at 1pm, and will be followed by dinner afterwards.
Agenda: The primary agenda is discussion of the work people are doing,
projects, things you're playing with, current events in crypto and privacy.
Several people have said they'd like to talk; please contact Bill or DDT.

@_subject: Jim Bell Trial: Second Day 
Any large company, particularly in the telecom business,
gets lots of subpoenas, lawsuits, etc., and it makes sense to have
somebody in their corporate legal department who's the front end
for managing that sort of thing.  Telecom companies not only
have regulatory issues that generate lots of paperwork,
sometimes initiated by the company, sometimes by governments,
and sometimes by third parties (often the competition),
but they also have lots of trucks and backhoes digging up streets,
which leads to whole rafts of opportunities for lawyers :-)
A particularly special case is wiretap requests and similar
demands for information about customers.  You *don't* want those to be
handled by some random droid - you want them to be handled by a
lawyer who's got lots of clue about what kinds of requests are legal,
what are non-supportable fishing expeditions, where the boundaries are,
what to do with requests that might divulge information about non-named and how to find the right people in the to deal with any requests that they are going to honor.
Ideally, you'd want this lawyer to be a junkyard dog too-cranky-for-the-ACLU type,
rather than someone who rolls over if asked nicely,
but there's also a lot of need for responding to subpoenas for
billing records in civil disputes where you'd expect the carrier to respond.

There's always "RSA in N lines of Really Ugly Perl" :-)
RSA only takes a couple of operations - easy to write it yourself
if you've got a bignum package, like the GMP Gnu Multiple Precision
math package.  The harder part, if you need to implement it also,
is finding big primes, but you may find code for that also.
Most or all of the international versions of PGP don't use RSAREF.
If you can find a version of "PGP 2.3" or earlier,
it predates the RSAREF code use, and is much smaller than
modern PGP bloatware (largely through lack of a GUI.)
Depending on the licenses those use,
you may be able to snag their code.

"Whatever recharges the battery" in a car is the alternator.
You'd wire it up to a battery feed instead - the lighting system
is distributed widely enough around the car that that's probably convenient

Doesn't matter - they're not trying to locate Bell within 100 feet

The book wasn't just about Ender being raised to be the Last Bugkiller.
Much of the activity was Ender's brother and sister
carrying on conversations on The Net, with multi-layered
reputation systems affecting who got invited to speak
on particular mailing lists, who got listened to, etc.
Some of the cypherpunks implications were that we all saw
reputation systems as a goal that Really Made Sense,
but also that turn out to be much harder to implement,
even on non-fictional paper, than to describe in fiction.
What kinds of algorithms do you use?  How do people outfox them?
How do you deal with not only the real Detweilers,
but with people using the kinds of pseudonym hacks that
Detweiler was constantly ranting against, such as creating a
bunch of pseudonyms that all give each other positive ratings
and positive reviews of each others' articles,
to create a bunch of reputation capital that's undeserved
and can later be burned if needed.

Other than the initial flurry of activity around the announcement,
there isn't much in chaffing and winnowing that's
really useful in most real-world environments
that would encourage development of new variations.
The fundamental point was that if *any* kind of digital signature
system is permitted, it can be used to implement encryption,
so bans on encryption technology are inherently bogus.
That doesn't mean that various governments won't try it,
or won't make laws requiring users of digital signature systems
to give up their signature keys when ordered by a court
or sometimes by police, but it doesn't really affect the
forced disclosure of encryption keys problem.

@_subject: The Culture of Secrecy, Disinformation, and , Propaganda... 
I don't know if Jim meant to send that reply about Usenet;
the sentence was chopped off in the middle, just after the
glaring incorrectness :-)  Usenet's newsgroup conventions have
been controlled by various Cabals over the years, but participation
has always been optional, and John Gilmore created the alt.groups
precisely to make it explicitly continue to be optional.
That doesn't prevent most newsgroups from turning into
permanent flamewars or dumping grounds for spammers....
But Usenet today doesn't really work the way the original
decentralized Usenet did.  NNTP allows clients to connect to
big servers, and the volume of traffic has become too large
for small sites to get a complete feed, so there's increasing
concentration at the bigger ISPs' news servers.
A few years ago, a friend who runs a small ISP estimated that a
full Usenet feed required "3 T1s, or 1 T1 if you don't get the porn groups"
and it's presumably gotten much larger since then.
"Nobody goes there any more - it's too crowded."
Napster was designed for a central index server,
but that didn't scale and the protocols were reverse-engineered
to make it easy to provide OpenNap servers that aren't
part of the Napster.Com server cluster.
It's still more vulnerable than Usenet or Gnutella,
but the model does scale decently once everybody ignores
the main Napster folks and moves to offshore servers :-)

@_subject: Timothy McVeigh 
Ramsey Clark, former US Attorney General and well-known leftie,
did a movie about the Yankee-Iraqi war.  He drove about 1000 miles
in a week during the heavy bombing period - a lot of driving around
at night with no headlights (so the Yankees don't bomb him,
but at major risk of driving into craters in the road)
and interviewing people who'd been affected.
Some of the notable interviews were a neighborhood in Bagdhad that
had half a dozen buildings bombed by US attempts to take out a bridge -
the locals were starting to think about blowing it up themselves
in self-defense when the US finally succeeded.
Clark did a segment at the notorious "baby milk factory",
and while it probably was legitimate, his film *really* looked like
somebody trying to make a propaganda coverup pretending that
this  factory was a
baby milk factory.  There was a pallet of bags of white powder
with a sign in English saying "Baby Milk" on it, etc.
Not one of the high points of an otherwise excellent movie.
Of course, leave aside issues like the appropriateness or
safety of baby formulas as a substitute for breast-feeding -
many of the same liberals who watched the film have been boycotting
Nestle' for years (and watching the Nestle' borg buy up the industry)
because of their dishonest promotion of these products in the
third world where average people don't have safe water supplies
and can't afford the product, and would be much better off
spending the money improving the nutrition of the babies' mothers...

@_subject: Stegotext in usenet as offsite backup 
"Your message may cost the net hundreds if not thousands of dollars."
Usenet may be effective for Blacknet and samizdat and
unreliable storage of critical secrets where the Fedz won't
stomp them all out, but it doesn't scale well for normal backups.
You can use one of those "100megsfree.com" sites, or buy storage,
and use some anonymizer to stash your stuff there.
The real advantage of using Usenet as opposed to a non-broadcast medium
is that it's much harder for eavesdroppers to find the people reading it
when they're targeting the writer, so you can use a Blacknet service anywhere;
if that's not relevant, then don't bother.
A broadcast medium like Usenet used to flood the net with
huge numbers of copies for a week or so, and after that
only a few archive sites like Deja would have it in findable form.
That's probably less true today, since more people read it
with NNTP on their ISP's machine, and many non-huge ISPs
use a small number of NNTP service providers instead of doing their own,
while the Dejanews-like services are less dependable.
Stegoizing usually inflates your data by a factor of 10 or so,
if you're trying to use credible stego (as opposed to simply titling
your cyphertext as pic12345.jpg or maybe adding some file headers.)
The real problem is that most of the searchable Usenet archive services
ignore binary attachments, so they won't keep the contents of your file.
So you'll need to use a stego system that turns it into text,
like Peter Wayner's Mimic Functions or Dilbert's Pointy-Haired-Boss-Speak,
adding yet another layer of content inflation.
Anything you post on Usenet is pretty much toast.
If you make plaintext world readable, it's world copyable;
if you don't like that, only post cyphertext.
Maybe the Berne Convention theoretically protects you, but so what?
You're proposing putting this stuff on Usenet instead of a storage site
because it's too hot for you to handle, so don't expect the
US copyright system to help you much :-)
It's especially rough on any Plausible Deniability you might have had.

A slightly cuter technique is to pop up the new advertising window *behind*
the windows with the real content.  When you're done reading the
real windows and close them, the ad's sitting there politely waiting for you,
trying to sell you that X10 camera yet again.

not sure if the performance is adequate for voice, though.
(I haven't tried it, but unfortunately I'd guess "not close"...
the throughput is about 19.2 before overhead, ~14+ after,
but there's likely to be way too much jitter and/or latency

Circuit-switched cellular modems are available, but too slow

Metricom, of course, is in the process of biting the dust hard this time.

As usual, this is an Open Meeting on US Soil, and everyone's invited.
Some events and topics that have been happening recently
include Sklyarov, Defcon, Worms From The Borg, and New FBI directors.
PGP is ten years old!  Several of us were at Phil Z's talk.
The 802.11 WEP Wireless Encryption Protocol has been cracked
even more thoroughly.  The Fedz couldn't crack Nicky Scarfo's PGP key,
but they could steal his passphrase by cracking his computer.
    The Stanford meeting location will be familiar to those who've been to our
    outdoor summer meetings before, but for those who haven't been, it's on the
    Stanford University campus (in Palo Alto, California), at the end of
    Santa Theresa, at the tables outside Tressider Union, just west of
    Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
    We meet at the tables on the West side of the building, inside the
    horseshoe "U" formed by the Tresidder building. Ask anyone on campus
    where "Tresidder" or the "Student Union" is and they'll help you find it.
    If the weather is bad, we'll meet inside.
    Food and beverages are available at the cafe inside Tresidder.

@_subject: Making text difficult for OCR? 
It depends a lot on your threat model.  If the people who want a copy
are determined enough, they'll just retype it :-)
If you're trying to make signs that video-cameras can't read,
that's a different problem than trying to publish comic books
that teenagers with too much time on their hands can't scan,
or trying to publish source code on paper so that your customers
can inspect the crypto without being able to scan/modify/compile it.
(The latter may satisfy the Gnu Public License (:-), but isn't
particularly useful for crypto, because people can't use it to
produce a binary they can trust...)
If your problem is to make the OCR job require enough manual tweaking
that the reader might as well just retype it, here's what I'd do:
split up each letter into multiple pieces, using different colors for
the different parts of the letter, and vary the color maps across the page.
Also do this for the background space.  And dither the pieces!
OCRs usually work by identifying features of the letter (vertical on the left,
horizontal in the middle, vertical in the lower right, etc.),
after deciding what parts are in the letter and what aren't.
So instead of having to find the black stuff on the white background,
or the yellow stuff on the blue background, it's having to find the
green and cyan dither stuff and the aqua and turquoise dither stuff
on the blue and indigo dither background and the indigo and purple background,
and further down the page you've shuffled other colors in and out of the mix.
So even if it's smart enough to edge-detect blobs of dithered stuff
on top of other dithered stuff, the blobs don't add up to recognizable letters -
they add up to fragments that only become a letter if you
put them all together successfully.

Two teenagers discovered the world's first internet bench could be used to
make free international telephone calls.
The cyber-seat, which is based in a public park in Suffolk, UK, went online
on Monday.
Neil Woodman and Dan Sanderson, both 17, took a normal telephone handset
along to the bench, which was created by Microsoft's MSN service in
partnership with the local council.
The pair cheekily phoned St Edmondsbury Council to warn them of the problem
and then tried to call Microsoft boss, Bill Gates.

@_subject: Stem Cell Speech? 
As Tim May pointed out, this isn't an issue of whether to ban the research,
it's an issue of whether to provide Federal Funding to pay for the research.
But the Feds are setting policy about privately-funded human cloning research,
and probably could set policy about embryonic stem cell research if they
wanted to.  The commerce clause is pretty much infinitely extensible,
or they could argue it's Protecting The General Welfare of US homo sapiens,
though of course the real issue is "Mah constituents think it's creepy and
keep rantin' at me about how Ah'd better do something, so of course Ah'll
vote for your bill."
The Equal Protection clause would even work, at least until somebody takes
it to the Supremes and says that Roe vs. Wade bans
Special Rights for Early Americans.
You could even stretch the DMCA far enough to cover it - either the
embryo or its parents owns copyright on the DNA, and there are technical
methods used to protect copying (so the cells only turn into the
kinds of body parts they're supposed to), and developing a mechanism
to evade that protection is a violation of the DMCA even if the
individual copyright owners participating in the research don't mind
having their DNA copied.
On a more serious note, I hope that any laws and policies they write
banning cloning are narrowly limited.  Lots of people get upset about
cloning *entire* humans, creating a new human being who's a pseudo-twin
of the original one, but that's much different from cloning body parts,
such as creating a clone of your liver or kidneys to replace the damaged ones.
A ban on the latter would be a real tragedy.

- you can detect electromagnetic radiation emanating from your house,

         and can differentiate from other similar radiation, such as that
         from your computer or your tv or cabletv or vcr or power line or PDA
         (if you're not in a single-family home) your neighbors.
         Costs money, probably too much work, difficult, but semi-possible.

         at least if they're twiddling it nearby where you can watch them,
         but they can diguise that by working from a Phone Company truck.
         You've got no chance of detecting tapping on the digital side.
- Neither of these methods will detect equipment that lurks around
         waiting for commands before transmitting.
- It's also difficult to detect elint eavesdropping hardware in your
         neighbor's place that's pointed at you, especially if you have many neighbors.
- It's difficult to detect black-box jobs that add hardware features to your PC;
         you might see bump-in-the-cord keyloggers, but you probably won't see
         anything hidden inside the case itself.  Epoxying everything together

         especially if your PC is a laptop that you stick in the safe when
         you're not using it or carrying it.  But you're not that paranoid.
- It's difficult to detect software changes - you can discourage them by
         using a Real Operating System instead of Windows, and running
         things like Tripwire that detect changes in critical files,
         and of course making sure that nobody's snuck in and swapped the
         CDROMs of software you're using for bugged versions so that the
         next time your hard disk crashes and you need to reinstall Red Hat or Win2001
         or applications get hosed and you need to reinstall Palm tools or other apps that
         you're not getting bugware as well.
A much easier approach is to bug your own place - set up your cheap camera
         pointing toward your PC desk, with that small pc running
         motion detection and tracking who's been there.
         Or at least use a burglar alarm that's got some off-site or
         other reliable mechanism for telling you when you've been burgled.

Back when I was playing with that technology,
there was no such thing as "cheap, effective, portable" :-)
The three main applications for shielding were
- FCC-grade quietness - so your neighbors don't complain about TV interference,
         but that's not enough to stop eavesdroppers
- TEMPEST-certified equipment, which not only needs the
         technical capabilities correct but also the testing and paperwork,
         which tended to add ~$5000 per PC.
- ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing, which uses
         big shielded rooms to make quiet environments for testing hardware in.
         The technology's pretty similar to TEMPEST-room shielding,
         except that you put the noisy stuff outside instead of inside,
         but it's the big expensive non-portable end of the product spectrum.

complaining that the American Taxpayers Alliance, based in DC, broke
California law by not registering with the CA secretary of state
as a political organization and not disclosing the identities of its donors.
They spent about $2M, and it's headed by Scott Reed, a Republican

@_subject: Voice crypto:  
Tim, Dr. Evil, and others were talking about Starium and other secure voice.
The Voice Over IP market has been growing rapidly,
with wiretappability built in,  and the Fax Effect making it more likely that
if you're on a VOIP call over the Internet or telcos it's insecure.
The primary standard in use is H.323, which doesn't do crypto
and which picks its TCP ports in ways that are hard to simply force
through IPSEC unless you're doing that for all your traffic.
Some of the followon standards may help, and there are other
VOIP systems out there (mostly proprietary), but H.323 is dominant.
SIP and MGCP are more wrappers around H.323 than competitors.
Other than random hobbyists or software developers,
most of the VOIP market is in several categories
- Microsoft Netmeeting users on the Internet (it's free,
         and comes with almost every $50 PC camera.)
- PBX replacements running on companies' private networks,
         behind firewalls and usually not carried on the Internet.
         They're pretty safe; corporate nets can be hacked,
         at least by insiders, but so can PBXs.
- International carriers providing gateways between US and non-US
         telcos, generally with the Internet in the middle
         but sometimes with their own private IP nets in the middle.
         These are tappable at the US telco edge, but for internet-based
         services, the Internet's probably an easier place.
- US companies like Net2Phone that provide cheap connectivity
         from PC users to telcos, and similar businesses being proposed
         but DSL and cable modem providers.  These have the problem that
         CALEA wiretap requirements apply to any telco-like provider,
         and any non-telco ISP or VOIPgate can be tapped at the telco edge.
I've been trying to set up voice communications on Linux that
I can try over IPSEC in my lab, using  to see how it sounds
and what issues come up while using it.  So far, I've confirmed
Hugh Daniel's comments that sound card support on Linux is dodgy,
unreliable, and a real pain.  Once I've got stable operating systems again
that don't complain about missing sound-chip driver modules,
I'll probably just run Windows (sigh) Netmeeting across the freeswan
and also across the Nortel Contivity stuff we're installing.

[The remailer-bandwidth sub-thread...]
Attention *is* the limited resource; if it can be turned into
script-kiddie-fodder it's ostensibly possible to get lots more.
The big wins with Zero Knowledge were supposed to be two things -
professionalizing the software so it's easy to install,
and a business model that encourages ISPs to keep it around
so you're not constantly worrying about getting kicked off your ISP,
which leads to much of the monitoring that requires ongoing attention.
Doesn't look like they won, but I'm glad they tried.
Julf's original remailer ran on a 486 fed by a 64kbps private line.
Modern remailers may get enough more traffic than that, but I doubt it -
that's 691MB/day if you're not worried about really fast response time.
I think most of the current remailers get a few thousand messages/day,
probably averaging less than 10KB/message, so there's plenty of Headroom.
Encryption burns a lot of CPU, but CPU's pretty near free these days.
If the system gets used for Napster-like services, however,
that involves lots more traffic.
Cable modems don't gain you much - there's great downstream speed,
so the remailer doesn't interfere with your other usage much
and you can absorb bursts of traffic, but the upstream is usually limited
to 128kbps in most of the US - only double the capacity of Julf's.
Also, most cable-modem carriers have highly short-sighted views of
what activities they want to allow and how many complaints they'll tolerate,
so you could get the boot pretty fast if you're not a middleman or in-only.
Petro's example of a colo site with dual gigabit feeds is more interesting,
though that's highly unlikely to be full-time access for Gig-E per host,
and most host computers can't keep up with that kind of load anyway.
Still, the last estimate I heard for Usenet (probably 2-3 years old)
was that the non-binaries used about 1 T1 full-time and the binaries used 2 so that's a total of ~5Mbps of drivel delivered right to your doorstep;
remailers definitely should be smaller than that Until It Changes.
Somebody said that remailers are pretty far down on the list of people
who the government wants to Squash.  True, but it wouldn't be hard to get
most of them shut down quickly if they did want to, either directly
in the US and cooperating countries, or through online cracker attacks
elsewhere (particularly by harassing the ISPs of the remailer operators,
who may not fold to overseas political pressure but don't like being attacked.)

This stuff was a *lot* easier when computers were slower.
I used to test my TEMPEST room at 450MHz, since that was high enough frequency
to cover any realistic level of emissions from the upper harmonics from the and it was also a short enough wavelength that leaks were pretty detectable.
It doesn't take much to get a leak - copper foil on a joint wearing out,
or the copper mesh we'd stuff inside gaskets getting set unevenly.
The waveguides we used for fiber or air vents were typically 1/8 inch wide
and an inch or two deep - and if you pushed a paperclip halfway through you'd
twang the leak meter.
Well, that was fine for computers that were around 10MHz.
These days, when 1GHz is slow, there's tons of stray energy above that,
and that stuff is much more penetrating, plus you've got all the
100 and 133MHz memory and disk bus stuff.
Fortunately, the equipment runs at much lower power levels;
you can run on batteries instead of 208-volt 3-phase (:-),
but I'm still glad I don't have to design a room or even a box
for that level of tightness.
That room was still in active use with a VAX 8650; we retired it

Removing big attachments is one thing,

use formats like that, they *do* happen (especially on the remailer-operators list,
where each different sub-version of Mutt seems to use a different format...)
Tim May periodically flames the users of attachments, and while I agree that
binary attachments are often non-portable and non-readable by many people,
there are attachments that are just text with MIMEage headers around it,
which are perfectly fine - if your reader can't do anything useful to display it,
it *should* be able to show you the raw message body and let you read around
the junk, just as you'd probably read around PGP signature headers.

This discussion has touched on a variety of topics, some of them at cross If you catch one cop in black ninja gear inside your house, and shoot him,
at least in California, you'll probably have legitimate self-defense claims,
and if he did yell "Police", well, dead men tell no tales.
Shooting a blue-uniformed cop inside your house will be much tougher
to get away with, even though it's legally not particularly difficult.
But it's extemely unlikely the cops would be doing a legally-authorized
black-bag job with just one person - much more likely they'd have
two or more, because sneaking into a Mafioso's house alone is dangerous,
and as Dr. Evil points out, they're going to try very hard to make sure
you're not home.  This will probably include knocking on your door under
some pretext, because if you *are* home, they'd much rather have you know
that they're watching you than that they're trying to sneak in and
black-bag your computer.  And it'll probably involve having lookouts
outside to radio the inside man with a "Cheese it, the Mafia!" warning
if you show up at an inopportune time.
Of course, if you shoot multiple cops in black ninja gear outside your house,
even if they're engaged in a military assault, it does tend to annoy
the rest of them leading to unfortunate consequences,
even if you're doing so purely in self-defense.
I have had cops break into my house, looking for a neighbor who had used
my apartment number on his car registration instead of his,
and been the confused occupant acting in a way they didn't expect,
but they weren't a SWAT team; it was a 6am service of an arrest warrant,
with three cops, and they'd been pounding on the door for about 10 minutes
yelling for "Anthony"; I had gotten to bed at 3am, and when enough of the
racket got through to wake me up, I initially assumed it was the neighbor's
friends or non-friends looking for him, though the word "Police" got used
enough I figured I had to go see what was up and staggered down the stairs.
Cop was standing in my front hall, and I yelled at him to close the door so the
cats wouldn't get out enough times to back him outside before we resolved the
other issues.  Unfortunately, I was still asleep enough that I didn't check out
the warrant, so I don't know if he's a Home Invasion Robber or something else
dangerous I should know to avoid, or just was being busted for failing to for a DUI charge which is no threat to me....

Slashdot is reporting that they've backed off in response
to negative public pressure.
So for the moment you don't need to wear a mask to shop there,
though they're probably still using cameras,
and in many parts of the UK the local government is
also videotaping the street.
David Brin's book "The Transparent Society" suggests that you
might as well get used to it.  Technological change driven by
the Moore's Law effects in computing power are making
video cameras and computer image processing get cheaper rapidly,
so the marginal benefit of using them doesn't have to be very high
to outweigh the marginal cost.  The real issues are still getting data,
but the costs of sharing data are low and getting lower,
and the government intervention that forces everyone to use
picture ID to do almost anything makes it easier.
Brin's conclusion is that since we won't be able to stop it,
we should work to make sure government activities are
open and watchable by the public.
Similarly, the cost of correlating non-image data has decreased rapidly -
many of the information collection practices used today date from
the 1960s and 1970s, when a "mainframe" might have a megabyte of RAM,
less than 10 MIPS of CPU, 100MB of fast disk drive, and everything else
was tapes and punchcards, and it required a large staff of people to feed it.
These days you can get pocket computers with ten times that capacity,
and a $5000 desktop Personal Computer can have a gigabyte of RAM and
a terabyte of disk drive with the Internet to feed it data;
that's enough for the name and address of everybody on Earth,
or a few KB on every American, and online queries are much faster than
the traditional methods requiring offline data sets.
That means that not only can governments and a few big companies decide
to correlate pre-planned sets of data about people, but almost anybody
can do ad-hoc queries on any data it's convenient for them to get,
whether they're individuals or employees of small or large businesses.
So if there's any data about you out there, don't expect it to stay private -
even data that previously wasn't a risk because correlating it was hard.
European-style data privacy laws aren't much help - they're structured for a
world in which computers and databases were big things run by big companies,
rather than everyday tools used by everyone in their personal lives,
and rules requiring making them accessible to the public can be turned around
into rules allowing the government to audit your mobile phone and
your pocket organizer in case there might be databases on them.
American-style data privacy laws are seriously flawed also -
not the fluffy attempts at positive protection for privacy that
liberal Nader types and occasional paranoid conservatives propose,
but the real laws which require increasing collection of data
in ways that are easy to correlate, such as the use of a single Taxpayer ID
for employers, bank accounts, drivers' licenses, and medical records,
"Know Your Customer" laws, national databases of people permitted to work,
documentation proving you're not an illegal alien, etc.
There's lots more data that would be readily available, but the
bureaucrats that collect it restrict access or charge fees that
reflect the pre-computer costs of providing the information.
If you need a reminder, go buy a house and look at the junk mail you get,
or have your neighbor's deadbeat kid register his car with your
apartment number instead of his and see what shows up.

Sigh.  The FBI buggers convinced Nicky Da Judge to let them slide.
FBI let off cyber snooping hook
By Kieren McCarthy
Posted: 28/08/2001 at 10:41 GMT
The FBI has been let of the hook in its court case against mobster Nicodemo Scarfo. US District Judge Nicholas Politan has now ruled that the Bureau will not have to reveal precisely how it managed to log evidence that Mr Scarfo was involved in illegal gambling and loan sharking.
Mr Scarfo's lawyers claim that the FBI bugged him without possession of a bugging warrant and so the evidence it gathered is inadmissible in court since it was obtained illegally.
Previously Judge Politan said the FBI would have to reveal how it managed to bug Mr Scarfo's computer after it had failed to unscramble encrypted files on his computer. Not unreasonably, the judge said that for him to decide whether it had been obtained legally or not, he would have to know the method that was used. This information would have had to be given to the defence.
But the US government has persuaded the judge that the defence should only get an "unclassified summary". How'd it do that? Well, would you believe it but there's some strange law that can be invoked at times such as this. This one is called the Classified Information Procedures Act - which amazingly allows information to be withheld if national security is at risk. The FBI also promised to give a secret meeting in which it would go into further details over how the system worked.
The FBI installed some kind of key-logging software on Mr Scarfo's machine after it failed to crack his encryption software. Since it didn't have a warrant to bug him, Mr Scarfo's lawyers say his constitutional rights have been infringed. The FBI says the technology it is using falls under current bugging legislation but many remain unconvinced and claim the FBI is going beyond current laws.
It doesn't inspire confidence either when the head of the FBI, Robert Mueller, testified to the Senate a few weeks ago that he was "not familiar" with key-logging technology. That seems about as likely as the Pope being a closet Jew, but then Robert wouldn't lie, would he?
Many observers will be concerned at the failure for the American legal system to bring out into the open the unnerving possibilities that the latest technology makes available to intelligence agencies. .

face a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail and $1M fine.
Meanwhile, the NYT had a front-page story that one of the
US propaganda agencies is proposing to help fight censorship in China
by promoting Safeweb, which is partly funded by In-Q-It, the CIA venture fund.
They've apparently got about 100 servers, and the Triangle Boy feature
makes it possible for them to keep changing IP addresses to make
blocking harder.  I assume if there are also Chinese Spies using it,
the CIA will be able to get the operators to rat out their identities...
But the main use will be to feed lots of news into China.
I'd already mistrusted Safeweb - not their honesty, but their technology,
since they require you to enable Javascript to use their tools.
Yes, it makes it easy to write cool and powerful tools,
but even if _their_ Javascript is perfectly secure,
the fact that you need to have it turned on leaves you vulnerable
whenever you read other web pages.  (Also, their Javascript is slightly buggy;
I've had trouble with window size and positioning issues.)
A third China Card in the news is the GAO's announcement that they
suspect that Code Red originated at a university in Guangdong.
Keith Rhodes, GAO's chief technologist, gave written testimony to
the House Government Reform subcommittee, but didn't return US Today's calls.
Of course, the real blame belongs to Microsoft - and US Today,
who are getting surprisingly technical this week, has a couple of articles
about the recent Hotmail/Passport hacks, in which security consultant
and former Yahoo security advisor Jeremiah Grossman, who had recently
cracked Hotmail in three lines of code, now has it down to one line...
This is another cross-site scripting attack.

OpenPGP, ClosedPGP, GPG, PGP2.x, and X.509 all have blazingly ugly data especially for keys.  The main advantages of recycling one of the
N variations on PGP formats or one of the K variations on X.509
are that you can reuse code, and in some cases you can gain compatibility
with existing user bases.  On the other hand, you can gain compatibility
with existing user bases by letting PGP users sign messages saying
"My Cryptoheaven Public Key For Messages is  and for Signatures is and similarly letting X.509 users do the same if they want.
It's not automated, but it can work ok.
Also, of course, you'd need to register the Rijndael and SHA-256
entities onto the **PG** formatspaces, but they're generally designed for it.
The cleanest key format I've seen is in CryptoKong - it has the
advantage that Elliptic Curve cryptosystems let you use short keys,
at least if you believe that the math works adequately,
and it's not trying to use any "KeyID" as an abbreviation for the key,
so it's just a simple direct encoding of the key,
without PGP's annoyances of KeyID lookup and risks of KeyID forgery.
Of course, it's also not mapping KeyIDs to users, only to messages,
so if you want to maintain relationships between them,
you've got to do it yourself, and if you want to have
senders of some messages vet senders of other messages,
you need to track the messages yourself.  James Donald's implementation
uses an Evil Microsoft Access database to save messages,
but you could do a different implementation if you wanted to.
Was the real motivation for using their own format simplicity?
Or not-invented-here-ness?  Or not-thinking-ness?
Or unwillingness to wade through the huge amount of existing ugly code
just for compatibility with existing ugly formats?
Does it matter much?  They're in the Software / Internet Services business,
so either they'll find a niche where they get lots of users
(in which case it's worth reviewing their code for real security),
or they'll fail to do so and Darwin Will Get Them,
like so many other projects out there, or they'll end up with a
small but fanatic group of users who keep them going,
or somebody will discover a Serious Bug which will blow away their security
(though they do have at least semi-open source available for review.)

Especially on Microsoft OSs, it's too easy to create logging
that doesn't look like a regular file for which you can watch

but with more work any good virus-writer can do a better
job of hiding a file.  Or you can find things that are
always changing for obscure Microsoftish reasons,
or look like devices that can't be checksummed.
Or you can store the data in the "unused" space at the end
of the last block in a file - especially as disks get larger,
disk blocks also get larger, so there's more space at the ends,
and any utilities that are checksumming files won't notice,
because it's not in the file.  Or you can store the data
in "unused" disk blocks, if you can keep the file system from
reaping them, though diskwipe utilities will occasionally catch these.
The unused block space _might_ sometimes be hidden or overwritten
by encrypted file systems, if you're using them; YMMV.
Hans Dobbertin's work a couple of years ago makes MD5 sounds pretty shaky,
but you could also use SHA-1 for your checksums,

But that's more work than the Fedz will bother with;
much easier to hide stuff on Windows than to hack checksums.

We're meeting Way Down South in the land of Boletus edulus mushrooms

It's an open public meeting on US soil, everyone's invited,
and it's another month where the Second Saturday showed up early,
so it's this Saturday.
* Eric Blossom will be giving a talk and demo on Software Defined Radios. *
An anonymous cypherpunk may allegedly be discussing development status
of unnamed anonymity products or more reasons for anonymity.
Several less anonymous cypherpunks will be discussing
tools to build, or rebuild, or build differently -
what lessons have we learned from PGP for the next product?
What's a practical toolset for a human rights organization?
Now that the list has been Officially Declared Dead (stego-mpegs at 11:00),
harassed by flooded machine rooms and mailing list glitches,
we've been taunted by some science-fiction authors,
finally probably been published by others, and been dissed by several
Intellectual Property judges, and informed that civil liberties
and due process are pre-millenial relics, we've got some slack
to re-evaluate the cypherpunks movement.  What technologies
should we be looking at?  What needs building next?
What succeeded?  What failed?  What synergies do we need to exploit?

UCSC College VIII Room 240.
While UCSC is a mere 30 minutes from Silicon Valley,
it's tough to get to from SF without a car,
so Bill Stewart will be meeting several Usual Suspects at

UCSC can be a maze to the uninitiated, so you will want to print this map.
The meeting space at UCSC is clearly marked:
here are some more maps:
To get to UCSC, take US 280 or CA 101 to US 880 or CA 17 south. Take CA 17
south to Santa Cruz, then CA 1 north to Bay St. Turn right on Bay which will
take you to the base of campus. One can also come south from San Francisco
on CA 1 to Bay.
At the base of campus, take a left onto Empire Grade, which will take you to
the West Entrance. Take that right onto Heller, and then take a right on
Koshland into the College Eight Lower Parking Lot. There's no need to pay
for parking on weekends, and as long as you don't park in a 24 hour space,
you won't get a ticket. If you need assistance with handicapped parking,
please email kristen at pobox.com.
Walk up the stairways between the College Eight dorms until you reach the
top flight of stairs. When you are facing the top parking lot, turn right
towards Room 240.
The cafe there will be closed for Christmas Break, so bring your coffee and
victuals with you.

From Claudia Schmeing 's summary:
1.  Release 1.93 ships!
     ===================
     1 post Dec 3
     A number of small improvements have been added to this release, which was
shipped on-time.
Some highlights:
* Diffie-Hellman group 5 is now the first group proposed.
* Two cases where fragmentation is needed will be handled better, thanks
   to these two changes
        The code that decides whether to send an ICMP complaint back about
        a packet which had to be fragmented, but couldn't be, has gotten
        smart enough that we now feel comfortable enabling it by default.
   and
        IKE (UDP/500) packets which were large enough to be fragmented used
        to be mishandled, with some of the fragments failing to bypass IPsec
        tunnels properly.  This has been fixed; our thanks to Hans Schultz.
* If Pluto gets more than one RSA key from DNS, it will now try each key.
   This will help when a system administrator replaces a key.
* There is preliminary support for building RPMs.
* SMP support is better.
* The team has eliminated a vulnerability that might permit a denial of    attack.
     We are in the process of chasing down a couple of significant bugs (which
     have been there since at least 1.92 and possibly earlier), and we *might*
     ship another release quite shortly if we nail them down and fix them.  If
     we don't, we won't.  Barring that possibility, the next release is planned
     for the end of January; a more precise date will be announced shortly.

I was surprised how effective such an amateur job was;
my corporate email system was pounded into the ground for
a couple of days.  Unless I'm misunderstanding the descriptions of this thing,
it didn't fire up automagically just from opening the message
or using the MSOutlook Preview Pane function -
it had to convince a sucker to actually run the file,
either by clicking on it or by saving it and running it.
Perhaps the descriptions have been incorrect?
Of course, one of the problems of Outlook-style mail systems
is that they often have mailing lists that hit the whole company,
or at least sets of tens of thousands of people, and this does seem
to do a good job of trolling for those lists, and continually pounding
once it starts, so it only takes a small number of suckers for it to explode.
I received a few thousand copies that I was aware of;
after I put a mail filter on my machine, there were probably
a few thousand more.
Of course, the quickly installed filters that our mail admins used
trashed all messages with "hi" in the Subject line,

         - look for recognized bad stuff, and
         - look for suspicious changes to good stuff.
plus an anti-technique
         - look for recognized non-bad stuff if one of the previous
         techniques detects bad or suspicious activity.

they make to important files so they don't look suspicious,
         "These aren't the viruses you're looking for.  Move along."

The two obvious ways that the anti-virus companies could cooperate
with Evildoers, Federal or otherwise, are to actively not comply

"ATM" is "Adobe Type Manager".  Linotype is a big font house.
Intellectual Property laws for fonts are normally even stranger than for regular material,
but if any of these are in Postscript, they're also programs,
so there may be DMCA issues, and there's obviously some contractual
relationship with Adobe that lets them copyright implementations.

Linotype gets heavy over free ATM font downloads
By John Lettice  - john.lettice at theregister.co.uk
Posted: 17/12/2001 at 12:15 GMT
German company Linotype Library GmbH is flexing its ATM font copyright muscles via 'cease and desist' letters with potential $30,000 legal tabs attached. The fonts in question do seem to be owned by Linotype (or to be strictly accurate, its parent company Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG), but are probably part of a batch that accidentally wandered into the shareware sector in the early 90s.
The fonts are frequently found for download on OS/2 sites, and have tended to propagate via mirrors, with the assumption that they're shareware propagating along with them. This was the case for Ian Manners, who runs  and who contacted The Register after receiving his letter from Linotype.
What does seem clear is that Linotype is making heavy legal noises in order to clear the fonts off download sites. And strangely enough, the fonts themselves (Cascade, Flora, Frutiger, Helvetica, Isadora, Linotext, Linoscript, Optima, Palatino, Peignot, Present, Shelley and Univers), are currently on sale at Linotype Library's site.
The fonts Ian was hosting complicate matters further, in that internally they have an Adobe copyright stamp in them. Adobe itself sells the fonts in question, and labels them as Linotype's trademark on its site. It seems fairly clear that the fonts are Linotype's property, and that even people offering cloned versions under the same names are going to be vulnerable to legal threats. From the Linotype letter, however, it doesn't seem to be the case that they're universally trademarked throughout the world, which could make actual legal action complicated.

For CJ to be on Cpunks is Hangin' out with his old Bad Company from the 'hood,
like that Jim Bell dude and the other guys on the Group W bench,
talking about criiiime and father-rapin' and poetic-terrorizin' and creatin' a disturbance.
The fact that they can't tell a web site from a mailing list
when they're writing orders forbidding him to do it
suggests it's not a deeply-thought-out policy here.
But that was just the point, in the Jim Bell case -
the Fedz came in with their 24 8x10 color glossies with circles and arrows on the back,
but unfortunately the judge and jury didn't have seeing-eye dogs,
so they actually looked at the things and listened to the Fedz,
and they *didn't* understand the technology enough to know that
Assassination-Politics-Quality Anonymity *isn't* available or usable,
and in particular, AP-Quality payer-and-payee-anonymous digital cash isn't and that if those fundamental building blocks aren't there,
then any discussion of "how could it be used?" or "like, that'd be cool, huh huh!",
at least by people who *do* understand the technology and state of its is strictly speculative philosophical bullshitting, not active conspiracy.
Now, it's possible that the Fedz in question really understood this at the but Jim Bell's such a mainstream sympathy-inspiring figure,
especially with his alleged history of stink-bombing IRS offices and
his alleged paperwork-based harassment of bureaucrats and politicians allegedly
with the so-called "common-law court" folks, some of whom allegedly *are* dangerous loons,
that in the absence of extemely competent counsel, skilled at
not only explaining really obscure technical material to hostile non-techies
but also at dealing with seriously uncooperative clients,
a conviction was a slam-dunk, so not only does it give them
Federal Brownie Points for busting a "dangerous terrorist assassin"
and preventing him from doing anything else real,
but it serves as a deterrent for future JimBell-Wanabees who *don't*
understand that the technology isn't there, and besides, he was in their face,
and kept getting in their face after they'd successfully framed him.
Is it likely that Jeff Gordon understood what was real about the tech
and was doing this out of pure malice, as opposed to not understanding it
and actually believing that Bell was a real threat?  I doubt he cared enough
about justice that, if he did come to understand that AP wasn't real,
that he'd either apologize for his mistake or let it get in the way of an easy win.
And CJ just kept jumping in the way yelling "Nyahh Nyahh" and looking wacko,
and even back before 9/11, furriners didn't have civil rights,
and he didn't get the "Oh, he's just Canadian" exception to that,
because he was scaring the Canadians too.
I've almost always found the weather in Seattle to be gorgeous,
except one or two times that it was also pouring rain here in San Narcisco;
maybe I'm just lucky.  And Seattlers *smoke* a lot also,
and it's always that nasty tobacco stuff, unlike down here :-)
But the bigger problems are that they're Fedz,
and that they fundamentally don't have much useful work to do,
and that there's real hostility to them up there which they respond to
in macho-tribal fashion, and face it, if you've got a choice of
keeping your job by doing a big dangerous-terrorist bust,
would *you* rather go after the real Aryan Nations types,
or would you rather go after a Jim Bell or CJ which gets you
almost as many Brownie Points without actually being
dangerous or requiring serious police work?
Sure, your coworkers might know it's a sucker play, but it looks
almost as good on the paperwork that goes to Washington,
which is good for the budget and your department's reputation,
and in return they'll be happy you got this annoyance out of their face,
and it's not like they're getting much non-cynical self-respect
out of what they're usually doing.

Doug and the Austin Cypherpunks Credit Union folks had the technical skills,

much less regulation than Real Banks, but figuring out how to make money
from such an activity was tough, and unlike MTB, they decided not
to launch a business they didn't know how to make money with :-)
Getting the real thing working requires real marketing skills
and being in the right place at the right time; occasionally
you can hit it off, like the kid who wrote WinAmp and was pressured
by his parents into making it Shareware and not just freeware,
or the Hotmail folks causing the free-web-based-email wave
(and catalyzing many of the appallingly stupid Dot-Com Business Plans.)
Perhaps one advantage of the dot-com crash is that people starting
businesses today are much more likely to do the solid business planning
and the initial technical decisions before they get enough
funding to leave the garage and hire the 200 programmers that
it takes to prevent any real work from being done while you're
having meetings to coordinate development of the hot-tub-scheduling website.
But if you're not going to use the marketdroids, you have to find
some really solid alternative to get the stuff widely used.

and they didn't successfully capitalize their need for a payment system.
Mojo Nation may have been a bit closer, as a small dedicated group

High-speed trains are almost as much fun to blow up as planes,
and muckers can do that by blowing up the tracks without
even having to get on the train.
Back when I was living in New Jersey and commuting to DC,
I usually took the train instead of the plane -
it took about 15 minutes longer, but was much nicer
(I lived closer to the train station, and most places I went in DC
were closer to the train than the airport, which made up for the
Metroliner being a bit slower.)  Now that they're adding an
hour or two to the plane trip, even the slow trains would be a slam dunk,
and they've now added an even faster train (though I'm not sure
if it stops in Central Jersey or just Newark.)
Here in California, if I'm going to Burbank it's still an hour or so
faster to fly than drive, but getting more ridiculous,
though for Orange County or LAX it's still a lot faster to drive.
But at least you can drive down the Grapevine without them
demanding that you take off your shoes, jacket, hat, pager,
cellphone, wallet, computer, wristwatch, screwdrivers, pocket knife,

Jim, I'm really surprised that you forwarded this spam to the list.
I received it directly also.
While he does have some useful comments about political organizing,
some of what he says about liberal/conservative differences is a pure crock.
We're in the middle of a radically activist right-wing statist administration -
they're doing far more than the Reaganites ever accomplished as far as
building up the political power of the military, reducing civil liberties for
citizens as well as non-citizen residents and travelers, strengthening the police agencies,
and moving power away from Congress and into the Executive Branch.
And yet this spammer Martin talks about conservatives not being activists.
To the extent that he's talking about the public rather than the
party activists and the elected and appointed officials,
conservatives today are less activist than during the Reagan/Bush and the early Clinton administration, but the new Administration
is the most activist we've seen in ages, whether or not they
were actually elected.  One of the technologies for getting
grassroots and astroturf support that both big parties developed extensively
over the 80s/90s is the use of direct mail for fundraising and
generating letters to politicians - the conservatives
and particularly the Religious Right Wing were probably more effective
than the various sets of liberals.  This looks like an attempt to
do similar things on the net.]

Yes, the user must nest those himself.  If he doesn't like doing it by hand,
there are client programs that can do this automagically.
The only way to get security is for the originator to do the encryption -
otherwise, if ANY remailer in the chain is compromised,
the Bad Guys can read the message.  If the originator does the crypto,
then EVERY remailer in the chain has to be compromised to break it.
The remailer-stats pingers publish this information on web pages;
you can retrieve it and read it by hand, or use a client program to fetch it.
If you don't want to keep it, don't.
And some of the clients are web pages themselves (Javascript or whatever),
so you can just retrieve them.
And obviously the sender needs to be able to pick the remailers to use -
depending on the type of message, some messages need to be sent through
remailers in appropriately safe jurisdictions, other messages don't
need much security but need high reliability or high speed
(so you want to pick remailers with good stats.)

@_subject: End-to-end encrypting US GSM phones? 
First of all, the sound system on a Palm Pilot can't handle the job -
there's no microphone, and the speaker system mainly knows how to beep
(you can play different tones, but it's not made for voice.)
Somebody said here that the iPaQ audio is half-duplex - too bad,
because push-to-talk is annoying.
Second, crypto is hardly ever the CPU bottleneck - voice compression is.
Public-key operations take some time, but only at startup;
RC4 at 9600 bps won't keep your CPU warm, and even AES at 32kbps isn't much.
But voice compression, if you want anything fancier than ADPCM,
does take a lot of horsepower, either from a CPU or a DSP or ASIC.
(ADPCM's dirt-simple, and works fine for 32kbps, but is pretty ratty at
16kbps or below.  Almost anything else starts burning lots of CPU
if you want to go 16kbps or tighter (some of the delta-modulation stuff
isn't very CPU-intensive, but it's also not good for low bit rates.)
I'd be surprised if anybody could get a dragonball to do the voice
compression tightly enough even if there were audio hardware support.
In the current cell-phone world, you typically need 9600 or below,
and 4800 would be better.  Cell phones do have voice compression built in;
unfortunately, the software isn't designed to let you get at the compressed
data stream and do other things with it, and if you're using modems,
you need one or two more sets of similar hardware to transmit it after that.
(The easy data channel in the US, CDPD, doesn't work for voice -
it fits the data into gaps between voice packets, so the latency
is generally way too long and way too variable to handle voice.)
Does GSM support handset-to-handset data connections?
Or does you have to use modems?   How fast are they?
Almost all of the newer cellphone data formats are fast enough,
usually 64kbps or more, if anybody bothers deploying them.
(I'm not counting the Japanese i-mode stuff.)
32kbps (plus async overhead, if any),
lets you use dirt-simple compression algorithms,
or you could burn some of your 206MHz horsepower on better compression.

Depending on the recipient, you might or might not be encrypting the message.
But the important security you're protecting is the connection between
the sender and the recipient.  Depending on the application,
the sender may be trying to prevent the recipient from knowing his address,
or the two of them may be trying to prevent outside eavesdroppers from
knowing that they're communicating, but in either case,
you only have that security if you can trust the remailer system
not to divulge the relationships.  If you let the sender's system
do all the encryption, then the entire chain needs to be compromised
for the connection to be revealed; otherwise any remailer along the way
can rat him out.  That doesn't mean that you can't gain some security
by remailers in the middle also adding hops on their own,
but the sender can't depend on that (at least unless he trusts
the remailers that are doing that), and of course you risk routing loops,
which are ugly things to detect in connection-obfuscating environments.

@_subject: Saw your post.Need help 
Depends a lot on what "basic information" means.
An IP address identifies an interface on a machine,
and the machine is probably either operated by a service provider
or gets connectivity from a service provider.
Depending on the service provider, you might or might not be able
to accurately identify an account on the machine in question, and may or may not get them to tell you what information they know about
the account;
if they give it to you, that information may or may not actually provide you true or usable contact information about the owner of the account, who may or may not be the person actually _using_ the account to send you
the mail.
Alternatively, the service provider may have a privacy policy that
refuses to tell _you_ the information about the account,
but may allow them to delete the account if the user violates their policies.
So start with the address you have - is it the address for a well-known free email service (e.g. hotmail, yahoo, iname, mail.com, netzero, juno).
If so, Murphy says the account holder probably provided bogus or non-useful info when setting up the account, so even if their privacy
policy lets them tell you that the account belongs to
"Bill Clinton, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington DC",
the return address is no longer valid.  But you might get the ISP
to delete the email account; that's the most you'll get
unless there's clear criminal activity or you want to hire a lawyer for a lawsuit.
If it's a commercial ISP providing non-free service, the user might
have a real account they're paying for, which means they're more
likely to have used real account information, but the ISP is likely
to be less willing to tell you any of it, or to delete the account
because they're making money from it, unless it clearly violates
their terms of service.
If all you know is the IP address, how do you find the machine?
The whois function on arin.net lets you look up the IP address,
which may belong to the machine's owner, or else to an ISP.
The whois function on betterwhois.com can tell you registration information
about the domain name of the machine.
Traceroute's pretty good about identifying machines, and hence ISPs,
which is particularly useful if the IP address is on a machine belonging to the person you dislike rather than a sevice provider.
(MSWindows's "tracert" is a wimpy version of the same utility.)
Of course, that doesn't always work, especially if the machine hosts
a bunch of domain names for customers (most web servers do;
many email servers also do), so the same IP address is used for
bigisp.net and user1 at bigisp.com and also user1-domain.com,
for user1, user2, user3, .... etc.  ISPs are usually even less willing
to drop paying customers with large machine connections,
unless there's a spam problem.
It used to be that in cyberspace, nobody could hear you scream,
but most machines have sound cards these days.
You could record some screams and email them to the miscreant,
then see if you can hear them when they receive and play them :-)
It's more effective for people in your office than outsiders. :-)

@_subject: published secret - similiar to AP prot 
One simple approach - have Bob use a CGI script for publishing the material,
e.g. that notifies Bob when the URL is accessed, and either returns
the desired file or another URL that points to the real file.
More complex - have Bob require a signature from Alice on the request.
Another approach - have the CGI script tell Alice the URLs for files that belong to her, or tell the recipient the URLS
for files that match a given keyword.
You have to think about threat models.  If Alice is under attack,
do the attackers have Alice's mailbox that would contain the URL?
Do they have Alice's private key?  Do you care?
Does Bob have a site like Cryptome where anybody can read everything?
Does Bob have a samizdat site where only people who have the
password for a file can access that file (and maybe the password
is the hash of the file)?   If Bob doesn't want legal problems because of Alice,
it's safer if he doesn't tell Alice, or at least doesn't
do anything different for Alice than he would for any other customer.
He can also be much safer if he doesn't store the file in a form he can decrypt.   A few years ago, I developed a couple
of protocols for variations of this problem.
All of these methods were designed so that Bob wouldn't
have to return a key to Alice - that lets it work over remailers.
The simplest version works like this
The author creates the file, calculates the key,
and sends the file to Bob, preferably over a secure channel.
Bob calculates the key, calculates the filename, encrypts and stores the file, then forgets the key.  If Alice (or somebody she gave the key to) wants to retrieve it,
she gives Bob the key, Bob calculates the filename
and returns the encrypted file.  That still leaves Bob with
some risk, because if he someone gives him the key,
he can find and decrypt the file, but the only way for
somebody (or Bob) to know if he has the file is to know the key.
Note that if you try to store multiple copies of the same file,
it's detected when Bob calculates the filename,
so Bob doesn't need multiple copies of the same Metallica track,
unless different people have compressed them creating
non-identical files.
Because the key is based on the file contents, not just keywords,
the attacker needs to know the whole file contents to
verify that it's there - the attacker can't just try
searching Bob's file system for "Osama" "cocaine" "narcoterrorism".
If Alice wants to make it easy for people to find her writing based on keywords, she can store the index
in a different file (somewhere else on the web,
or perhaps in a different file on Bob's samizdat site.)
Some versions that are more paranoid give Bob more protection
or the author more control:
and the retrieval uses "handle" instead of "key",
so Bob or an eavesdropper can't decrypt the file at retrieval-time
if he didn't save the keys, which is safer for Bob,
because he can't tell if the material he's storing is ThoughtCrime.
lets Alice give people her friends the key and handle,
but gives her a token she can give Bob demonstrating that she's
authorized to do things like delete the file.
(Also, you could use the control and not the handle, or whatever.)
None of these prevent Bob from reading the file he's storing.
If Alice cares about this, she should use separate encryption.

Yes, your analysis is way off base.  The reason is that there are much better algorithms for factoring - a factor of 10 difference in the number of clock cycles per step
is rapidly dwarfed by an algorithm that takes far fewer steps.
If you look at Schneier's book, there's a discussion of
factoring algorithms - Quadratic Sieve algorithms are good for
fewer that 120-150 digits, and above that there are algorithms like
the Number Field Sieve and its variants with run times of
which is a lot fewer than trial division.

Agreed - if the ISPs aren't spoof-proofing, it's very tough to defend
against, as Lars and I noted.  But if ISPs, particularly the cable and DSL
ISPs, are spoof-proofing their outgoing packets, there won't be an unblockably large 1,000,000 addresses, just a still-annoying 1000 addresses, and the addresses you'll be blocking are mostly sites you won't miss (cable, DSL, and dial-up subscribers) rather than a random scatter
of probably-useful systems and networks around the net.
The magic of SYN attacks is that you don't have to accept
more than one SYN from a given machine at a time,
at least for a given port, so you don't have to use firewall rules
except to limit the range of ports that are being targeted,
and when you start to build rules, you only need 1000 of them.
Fortunately, that's only 80 Megabits, not Gigabits, so it's only a T3-killer, not an OC-768-killer :-)  Still annoying.
You can fill the T3 with about 1500 dialup users,
and about 5 times as fast with cable modem or IDSL,
15-30 with faster DSL, and of course much faster with university machines (where you're limited by the university's aggregate outgoing bandwidth
rather than the individual smurves' bandwidth.)
Of course, if you've only got a T1/DSL/Cable line, you're toast.
But there are several different attacks here -
I'd be surprised if there's a legitimate use for 8KB SYN packets,
though I'm not sure any current firewalls have an easy way to
detect and block that, so it may work.
Some attacks are likely be blocked by firewalls -
ports you don't want, UDP packets and traffic pretending to be
from open TCP connections when you haven't done a SYN first.
Those still flood your incoming pipe - some ISPs are
offering network-based firewalls that can do simple filtering
at the upstream end of the connection to reduce the
bandwidth you spend on anklebiters.
But still, a 1000-machine attack is hard to do much about by yourself,
and as you say, the upstream providers will get swamped also
until you go out smurf hunting and get the things killed off.
There have been some proposals to add various tracing to the
backbone networks that may be of some help in the future.
Things could be far worse, though - imagine if some popular software
package that people installed on purpose had DDOS capabilities,
like a hacked Napster client or Quake Performance-Booster or Netscape Foobar-Graphics plug-in or a more clever than usual MSWord virus.
Bad stuff.

The trick with double extensions is that after
Explorer or Outlook hides the .VBS, the user sees the ".JPG"
and says "Oh, this is a picture, I'll click on it",
instead of "Hmmm, this is something I don't recognize,

Similar tricks are used for .doc.vbs, .xls.vbs, .txt.vbs, etc.

Dear Mr/Ms Ponnavolu -
The cypherpunks mailing list runs on multiple servers.
There are several subscribers around the world who maintain archives
of the list, plus anything that's ever been on the web tends to
be copied in google.com's caches, even if it disappears off the
original site.  While you can't change the past, if you would like to change
the future's view of the past, you'll need to contact the
administrators of the actual archives.
Also, your request to be removed from the archives
was mailed to the list, and it will therefore appear in the
web archives of the list, and be cached at google and other places.

The 2001 RSA Security Conference will be April 8-12 in San Francisco.
The Bay Area Cypherpunks monthly meeting is normally the second Saturday,
except when there are major conferences in town.
If you're visiting the area that week, are you likely to be here
for the weekend of the 7th or the 14th?
Enough Usual Suspects are expected to be in town the 7th that if we don't move the meeting, we'll probably do a get-together
at a nearby brewpub.
Passover starts the weekend of the 7th/8th and ends the weekend of the 14th;
Easter is the 15th.

@_subject: Escaping the Internet Archives - Re: Please remove... 
Cheryl - Happy New Year 2001!   Cypherpunks is a mailing list.  Are you asking us to remove your message from the list archives?
There are multiple archives run by various people around the world -
they're even more decentralized than the mailing list,
plus the list is gatewayed to some Usenet newsgroups,
so there may be Usenet archives as well.  The ones that
are easily located by search engines are in Singapore and Germany.
Also, the google.com search engine caches articles it finds -
even if we delete them, they won't disappear.
Your message to the list, and this reply to it,
will be automatically entered in the archives as well,
joining your original message.
Most archivists don't like to change the past, especially when the things run automatically, but the reason you'd be in one of the archives is because you sent advertising email
to three of the email addresses used by the cypherpunks list on September 28, 2000 using your addresses cheryl at socialplus.com
and your_friends at socialplus.com .    	P.S.  Please do not hesitate to contact me at the above numbers.  The usual reason people ask to be removed is so spammers don't find their names on the net.
Given the reason your name appeared on our list,
your request will probably elicit more amusement than sympathy,
but we haven't hesitated to archive your contact information.
Perhaps it was a mistake, or someone gave you bad business advice
on useful ways to increase sales, and you did include your contact
which is pretty unusual for a spammer, but you'll find that
information you've posted to the net never disappears
(unless it's something actually useful that you need badly,
in which case it hasn't disappeared, it's just where *you* can't find it.)
Good, bad, ugly, whatever...  you can't escape your writing.
There're flames out in some Usenet archive that I posted in 1982,
back when it was called Netnews and wasn't carried on the Internet.
If information never disappears, how do you keep it from
coming back to haunt you?  Best you can do is have a common name -
somebody named Jim Johnson wouldn't have to worry about this.
(Won't work for you.  Sounds like your family's Iranian?  :-)
The next best you can do is use minimize the amount of contact
information and other unique correlatable data you provide, and use different email addresses for different things.
So, for instance, Yahoo mail says you live in Orange, NJ -
determining whether that's true shouldn't be hard.
USSearch.com thinks so too, but they just got that from Yahoo.
And your email addresses cmgmba at yahoo.com and cheryl at socialplus.com
were easily linkable by anybody searching on your name
even before this message stuck them together.
By the way, SocialPlus.com's privacy policy says you collect a _lot_ of information,
which isn't surprising for a dating meta-service, and says that it's
only disclosed under a variety of conditions, including the gaping big hole of telling advertisers when users view their ads
(on viewing, not just on clickthrough.)  It does recommend using your
pseudonymous screen names, and warns that       therefore, care should be taken in disclosing personal information.       by Visitors or Subscribers."
So please understand that your publicly disclosed information is public.
But, hey, you've come to the right place, and have we got a deal for you!

It's strongly related to the age of the building,
as well as climate, fuel costs and convenience, etc.
Most modern construction uses forced-air heating,
it's cheap, responds rapidly, doesn't take up room space, and
the ductwork can be used for central air-conditioning.
My condo in Silicon Valley uses electric baseboard heat,
which was a fad in the 60s and 70s when electricity was cheap,
and has high ceilings so it doesn't need A/C in this climate.
My apartment in Berkeley 20+ years ago had a gas-fired wall heater,
relatively small and efficient for a 3-room place.
My house in New Jersey, built in 1931, had steam radiators,
with an oil-fired boiler that was originally coal-fired;
my sister's house in Delaware is a bit older and has hot-water radiators.  I paid less for winter heat in the Berkeley apartment
than I did for summer electricity in New Jersey;
I pay more now for winter heat in this mild California climate
than I did in New Jersey where the winter gets reasonably cold,
because electricity's more expensive than oil (even with
lower night-time prices) and high ceilings are much better
for keeping cool in the summer than warm in the winter,
plus nobody bothered to insulate buildings out here in the 70s.

@_subject: MS Product Activation for Windows (licensing) 
Copy protection is annoying when you have only one machine.
It's much more annoying in the commercially interesting case,
which is when you have many machines and are
copying things legitimately.
I've got a lab with half a dozen year-old El Cheapo PCs
and half a dozen Genuine Antique AT&T Pentium 90s.
Then there's the stack of old-beater laptops,
which are very nice machines to put in a rack of routers
when you just want a Ping/FTP/Web target.
The El Cheapo PCs each came with a licensed Win98;
I've got the disks in a stack, and keeping track of which CD goes with which PC would be a serious annoyance.
It's actually worse, because the PCs are pieces of junk
that need to be have major chunks of Windows reloaded
every once in a while, though at least Win98 has less of the
"you have moved your mouse, please put in the Windows CD and reboot"
that Win95 had.  It's annoying enough to keep track of
which Win98 serial numbers go with which CDROMs -
writing the number on the CDROM helps, but you can't
read it when it's in the drive :-)
The P90s were covered by a site license; I never had
individual media for them (and most of them don't have CD players,
which makes the "Please put the Win95 CD in the drive" more annoying.)
The copy of Win95 I've got on CDROM was from somewhere else.
Many of them are happily running Linux now.  N of them hang out on a DSL connection for doing firewall testing,
and they're named "Kenny" because they're targets for kiddies,
and it's nice not to mess with copy protection when I
reload the OS.
Some of the laptops still have their CDROMs; some don't,
and the ones that do often have funky drivers.
That's why they're still running Windows....
at least they don't crash very often, though you still
have to reboot them if you change static IP addresses.
And I paid cash money to upgrade the home machine to Win98 Second Edition specifically to get Internet Connection Service, which didn't work as promised
and trashed the DLLs used by several other commercial products
in ways that uninstalling didn't fix.
Will I feel guilty if I install WinME on two or three boxes?
(Skeptical, yes, but guilty?  No.)

At 11:36 AM 1/10/01 -0600, Jim Choate replied to Declan's >> > post:
The paperback book example has nothing to do with intellectual property -
it's about real property, the dead-tree portion of the book that's left
when the bookstore mails the front cover back to the distributor for credit and claims the rest of the book has been destroyed.
Somebody, I think Jim, incorrectly said this was an issue about royalties,
which would be IP-related, but it's not - royalties are what the publisher pays the author when the book gets sold, while this is about
what the bookstore does or doesn't pay the wholesaler when the book
does or doesn't get sold.  (I'm not sure which legal rules cover it -
fraud, tort, conversion, maybe theft by the store, so possibly
possession of stolen property by the purchaser or other recipient.)
However, that doesn't mean Declan's correct :-)
Before the Digital Millenium Copyright Act, he probably would have been,
but the DMCA is a vague ill-defined mess of evil intentions that
are increasingly being expanded (or at least people are attempting to
expand them; how much holds up in court remains to be seen.)
The DeCSS cases are a relatively direct use.  The Scientology claims
against E-Bay for using electronic tools (their auction system) to
violate their intellectual property constraints (by helping
ex-Scientologists sell used E-Meters to people who haven't paid
the Church of Scientology for their trade secret religious materials)
is a way blatant stretch, but seem to have been enough to intimidate E-Bay.

@_subject: crypto implementation for small footprint devices 
There's been a lot of work in the Smart Card community on
fitting crypto into small memory space - I don't know if the
"Independent Smart Card Developers' Organization" is still active
- probable address - plus there are products from a number of smart card vendors.
Dallas Semiconductor's i-button includes a crypto version.
Certicom has the patents to many of the Elliptic Curve cryptosystem
versions, and they've done a lot of work on products for small environments.
ECC has an advantage over RSA and Diffie-Hellman public key methods
because the key lengths are much shorter, typically 160-256 bits
instead of 1024 or 512.  On the other hand, the math is much more complex
than the bignum modular multiply and exponentiation that RSA and DH use,
so the code space would be larger.  And 128 bytes may be large on a smartcard,
but it's not that big on anything else.
Is your space constraint RAM, or ROM/Flash code space?
It's easy to fit the data space for most crypto algorithms
into a few KB; the complexity is in the code space.
Some of the data transfer formats wrap a lot of header
and encoding around it, but some are simpler.
Unfortunately, ASN.1 and PGP both put lots of complexity
into data formats to squeeze out a few bits of space,
so the code tends to be bloatware.
If you're willing to do your own data formats, or use XDR,
you can eliminate most of this.  (Simple bignums, etc.)
On the other hand, if you want full browser capability,
you'll need to do real SSL, so you can't avoid them.
Most of the crypto algorithms themselves are relatively small -
RSA and Diffie-Hellman are each a few lines (plus a bignum handler).
The RC4 symmetric-key algorithm is extremely small,
and operates on 8-bit bytes rather than bignums or bit-twiddling,
and the 128-bit versions are very secure as long as you
follow a few simple rules about usage.
DES is ugly, and the hash functions are ugly,
but they're still not very large.
The 2-lines-of-perl versions are horrendously ugly,
and drag in perl's hugeness, but most of the ugliness
is because Perl doesn't have native bignums and
because they were converting from decimal input instead of hex.
The Lisp and Python equivalents are pretty clean and still small :-)
Digital signatures themselves are generally more complex
because you need to handle the name of the thing that's being signed,
and any semantics that thing drags with it.  For instance,
are signatures fully general with N layers deep of key certification,
or are you just going to handle signatures from a built-in key
signing hashes of messages and code updates?  (Or signatures from
keys signed by a built-in key.)
What you need for space depends a lot on your objectives and on
how general you need to be.  Sometimes you can get by with
a few primitives to secure your communication to a central server
and do the more complex stuff on the server.
You're also going to have issues if you want to use the crypto
for protecting television content :-),
since that's typically a fast-moving target that changes
almost as fast as the pirates figure out how to crack it.
But even that crypto normally fits on smartcards.

I have a friend who could have really used a program like this
a few years ago - he was working in Ethiopia, and he had enough trouble
keeping the local kleptocrats from stealing his computers
"they don't run without the passwords, so you can't resell them"
and the phone company yelled at him for making phone calls in Dutch,
which their eavesdroppers couldn't understand; French or Italian
or English would have been ok if he wasn't using a local language.
We got him a copy of PGP, but he didn't feel safe using it.
I think it _was_ Peter Wayner who posted it - this is an implementation
of his "mimic functions" paper from some years ago.

One of the major values to fiction is that it lets you think about
the social implications of technology, in most cases without
going deeply into the technology itself.  That's important for
cypherpunks, though the street finds its own uses for tech,
and it's easier to describe crypto non-bogusly than it is to
describe star-drive engines or brain-machine interfaces.
Neil Stephenson's Cryptonomicon is of course recommended,
and classics like Vinge's "True Names" and "A Fire Upon The Deep".
and Stephenson's "Snow Crash".  Orson Scott Card's "Ender's Game"
has some nice treatment of reputation systems and pseudonymity -
unfortunately it's *much* harder to get the tech correct than it is
to write about what if feels like to use well-designed systems :-)
Brunner's "Shockwave Rider" and Sterling's "Islands in the Net"
hit some of the appropriate space.
"Trouble and Her Friends" has some good treatment of cryptographically
protected subcultures, though that's more as redeeming-social-value
for a book that's written for genre.  "Idoru" by Gibson does some of the same.
Then there's "ruthless.com" by "whatever hack writer Tom Clancy's franchised his name out to these days" - Bad Tech, 1-dimensional characters,
but it's interesting to see whose political agenda he's selling out to.
Bring your barf bags, but read it....
Etizoni is a very technical boy.  Unfortunately, his value system
led him to invent "Fair Cryptography" (that's "fair" as in "Fair Trade",
not "fair" as in "actually fair to anybody" :-), which covers a couple of variants on key escrow.

I don't know about mainframes, but it wouldn't surprise me,
though the cooling and power systems are a bit large.
I do know that there was a PBX on Looking Glass back in the 60s -
a friend of mine did telecom for SAC Offutt, and says that
one of the people on the plane once noticed that there were
two lines busy on the PBX, but nobody on the phone.
They tracked it down, and found that some guy in the barracks
had a 16-button Autovon phone, and had dialed the magic number
on the ground-based PBX to get forwarded up to the bird,
dialed across the PBX and back down, then dialed out on AUTOVON.
Needless to say, unlike barracks phones which couldn't call much of
anybody off-base without asking the operator to set up the call,
the PBX on Looking Glass was allowed to call anybody in the world
that it wants to, at any priority it needs, so the guy was doing
a reasonably high-priority call to his buddies in Guam.
(AUTOVON was the old DoD AUTOmatic VOice Network, which had
a 5-level priority system to make sure that important calls get through.
To some extent, the priority system was also used to allocate
expensive resources, e.g. voice calls across the Pacific were more likely to succeed at Priority level than Routine,
and probably wouldn't get knocked down before you finished.
The extra four Touch-Tone buttons were used to signal the
priority level, and specific phones and locations were limited
in the level of priority they could dial.  Alternatively,
if you only had a regular phone, such as most phones on base PBXs,
you could place a priority call by asking the operator to connect you.
As a friend of mine said "We were authorized to make Flash-level calls,
but only if we actually *saw* a nuclear explosion..."   That's level
4 out of 5.)

files.  program work. program? Mrs. Banks  Mrs. Banks - Cypherpunks is a large, noisy mailing list.
In addition to talking about cryptography, privacy, and the effects
on economics and politics of being able to talk and conduct business
without government interference, and random other topics,
we end up receiving lots of mail from people pretending to be
teenagers asking us about bombs, hacking, credit cards, etc.
Some of them are clueless kiddies who think we'll tell them
how to steal stuff to make bombs so they can be rilly kewl d00ds,
some of them are annoying kiddies who've found they can stir up
lots of annoyed discussion by posting provocative or clueless questions,
and some are probably cops who think they can stir up business
by finding people doing stuff with Bombs and Computer Crime
that make good headline material.*
So don't be surprised if readers like Blank Frank take you for one of these three categories (start at the middle and work your way out),
and either gives you the flames you're looking for or
the abuse you deserve if you're one of the clueless types.
Your message could be perfectly legitimate, but it's just
dripping with troll bait....  We haven't had anybody
saying their somebody's Mom who wants to break into her kid's
machine before, but hey, there's a first time for everything.
On the other hand, many of us were once teenagers who had
parents who didn't understand us (what a surprise, eh?)
and a request saying "I don't trust my kid and I want to crack
his passwords to spy on him" isn't guaranteed to get more
sympathy for you than for your kid.
Anyway, that being said, there are only a few reasons for having
lots of Microsoft password files around.  One is that your son has created
lots of logins on your home computer, either for his friends to use
or because he's creating lots of different identities for himself.
The former is something you may want to talk to him about,
depending on how much control you want to have over that computer
(is it his bedroom game machine or are you running the family business on it?)
Another is that he has logins of his own on multiple machines using
Microsoft-style logins.   That's kind of odd - is he running a bunch
of web pages on FrontPage-based servers, or is he cracking into
corporate machines?
The "17 passwords" is pretty close to a magic number, which is the number
of "access devices" it takes for possessing stolen/cracked passwords
to become a US Federal crime.  I forget if the number is 15,
in which case by asking us to crack them you're asking us to
commit a Federal crime (remember the discussion about cops trying
to win friends and influence headlines through entrapment?),
depending on whether you have authorization to access the machines
that those passwords apply to (if you give us permission to crack the
passwords for your own machine, it's not a crime, but if they're
the passwords for your kid's publishing accounts on commercial porn sites,
that might be criminal, and if they're for accounts your kid's
trying to break into, or if you're really the kid or a cop,
it could be criminal.)  So if you're thinking about breaking into your kid's machine,
because you don't trust him, yes, you've got some relationship
problems you'll have to deal with.  Not much different from asking
your kid where he went and having him say "Out" - either you go
ask all the neighbors where he went because he won't tell you,
or you work on the relationship, or you hire a private detective
to track him, just as you could probably hire Access Data or somebody
to break his password files, if you were willing to risk criminality.
I'd recommend going for the relationship....
*  (Perhaps some are even good cops trying to do what they think is their job by stopping clueless kiddies from posting dangerous inaccurate information where more clueless kiddies will find it.  We do have some cops and Feds on the list that are open about it, and they're good folks we go shooting with :-)

a 64-card version would still be reasonably secure.
The Illuminati collectable-card-game cards from Steve Jackson Games
would do well (maybe there are 256?), but it's easier to do
something with suits and numbers on lots of the cards;
a Tarot deck has something like 79 cards, and an appropriate
amount of deliberate obfuscation.  There's also the Silicon Valley Tarot (which first appeared on the web,  but SJG sells the cards) which has more localized archetypes,
like The Hacker, The Garage, The Ace of Cubicles, Bugs, Encryption.

I'll leave discussion of whether the term is actually
inappropriate for GWB to those who are better informed ;-)
Google's search engines do weight their responses based on
how many web pages link to a given page - there's probably
some minor trick involved in getting the keywords into a page that doesn't use it (or at least perceived by Google to be.)
But it's not that hard to develop an HTTP server that will
serve up large numbers of "different" web pages that all reference
the page you're trying to push - the server can go pretty fast
when it doesn't need to read an actual file or search directories, just output a bunch of cached strings in some slightly random order that
keeps google happy.   Depending on google's search algorithms,
there may be optimal mixtures of different domain names,
IP addresses, and file names to encourage google's spiders to
come back as fast as possible, and it's highly probable that
somebody's been experimenting with that precisely to
promote their commercial site.  It helps to have high bandwidth,
and it may help to piggyback on an existing web server just to
include pointers to the fake-site-pool to increase the number of
real links coming in from the outside world.
Is google already trying to track hacks like this?  Probably :-)

@_subject: Ashcroft Targets U.S. Cybercrime 
I'm not sure which of the >s are Petro, Schliesser, Measl, or others,
I think this was Petro, who I think was a Marine, and therefore should know The Uniform Code of Military Justice *requires* soldiers to
refuse to obey illegal orders.
Police generally are required to uphold the Constitution,
and no amount of weaseling about "I'm not the departmental legal counsel,
I'm the guy with the blue suit" relieves them of that responsibility.
There are substantial differences between these two situations -
usually an illegal order to a soldier involves shooting people,
while an unconstitutional action by a cop involves arresting people
or serving warrants on them, which can be argued about later,
so it's far more critical that a soldier individually do the right thing,
even though an inappropriate refusal by a soldier can result in lots of
dead people, while an incorrect refusal or inaction by a cop
only results in somebody not getting arrested or the
city's insurance company paying a bunch of lawyers for a lawsuit.
It's both.  And enforcement of laws typically has a huge latitude -
the DMCA doesn't say anything about refusing to give Dmitri a bail hearing,
or whether to take every piece of electronics in a "hacker's" house.
The "I know it when I see it" test for obscenity is very broad.
And the property-forfeiture-for-drugs laws may allow police to
steal anything nailed down or not if they think they can make a case
that there might have been drugs around that the victim won't have
the resources to successfully defend against, but don't require it,
and enforcement seems suspiciously correlated with which police
departments make a profit from doing it.
Certainly Janet Reno and Louis Freeh were a bad lot and we're well rid of them,
but Ashcroft's belief in the Constitution certainly appears not to
include the First Amendment.  We'll see how much he likes the others
as he goes along.
I strongly disagree.
Let's start with a terminology rant -
Cops used to call themselves "peace officers".  Sure, it was propaganda,
but the point is that they're there to "serve and protect"  (at least for the upper classes.)
Or they claimed they were in the "Justice" business.
Now they're calling themselves "Law Enforcement", trying to use the
culture's leftover respect for "law" as a protection of individual rights,
rather than its current meaning of "whatever the legislature writes",
whether that's special-interest support like the DMCA or
religious/cultural preferences like the laws against some drugs,
and trying to use this to justify the use of however much force it takes
to force people to obey.  No different from what an invading army does.
If a cop believes that a law is unconstitutional or unjust,
then if anything his job is not to resign and let someone else enforce it,
but to prevent its enforcement, at least through inaction
if not through active reorganization of the police force.
If equal application of the law has a part to play here,
it's in getting other cops NOT to impose injustice,
not in copping out by imposing injustice himself or quitting.
It was clear, just wrong - but go ahead :-)
         [Example 1 - people don't know if they'll be pulled over by Good Cop or Bad Cop, especially near town border.]
         [Example 2 - Good Sheriff replaced by Officer Hardass. ]
It's still wrong to enforce unjust laws, and also to enforce unconstitutional ones.
If a law's on the books, the citizens have to decide individually whether to obey them.
The examples given involved concealed handguns and searches for same -
if police are doing unconstitutional searches, there are problems anyway.
Problems with differing laws at borders are difficult anyway,
but having a location where laws are enforced less strictly is certainly
no risk for the neighbors, and we've already got enough laws that you're
probably violating some of them without even realizing it.

because there are thousands of pages of special cases designed mostly

band-aid the code to achieve the next social or political objective.
And the special interests who are successful in getting them to do things

While Declan's comment about Choate was a bit offtopic,
you could draw analogies between ORBS and the McCarthyite Red Baiters.
"I have a list here of 200 Spammunists, and if you don't trust my list,
YOU must be a Spammunist Dupe and we'll put you on the list too!"
Unlike Vixie's MAPS, which was mostly well-behaved and reasonable,
ORBS was a loose cannon blasting around at random,
and to continue the Anti-Commie analogy,
they _did_ go busting into places hunting suspected Spammies,
and harassing anybody who objected like FBI agents
harassing anybody who insisted on seeing a warrant.
A real reputation system needs to deal with extremes like this,
including small, loud agitators, big quiet ones Disneyfying the culture
or Moral Majoritarians, ranting Detweilers with axes to grind
(who gave us invaluable practice before the spam floods hit)
and all sorts of other problems.
ORBS was a good learning experience.  So is the trouble that people like
John Gilmore (and to a lesser extent, me) are having with
spam-blocker technology (mainly closed relays) blocking legitimate email.
The 802.11 wireless LAN technology and the risks of drive-by spammers
balanced with the desire for open access give us some more opportunities
to find a good balance of openness vs. ease of abuse.
Anybody want to build a hashcash-enabled SMTP relay for wireless?
Or for that matter, a hashcash-enabled SMTP proxy for general use?

@_subject: Entire ISP Forced to Close 
Most of my experience is with big backbone providers,
big enterprises, web hosting services, and very small ISPs.
Early on, there were three main backbone providers - MCI, UUNET, Sprint -
and a small ISP would buy their first T1 feed from MCI (cheapest),
and as soon as they could justify a second T1, they'd buy it from
one of the other providers so that hopefully there wouldn't be
bad routing instabilities on both at the same time.
Things have gotten much more reliable, but also much bigger,
and most ISPs still buy diverse connections when they need more than one.
Almost every web hosting ad talks about having multiple connections,
whether that's 2 T3s or 2 OC12s to different backbones,
because you still need it for reliability.
If you're out of service for a day, you lose customers, fast,
while if your performance is doggy for a day, they'll usually stick around.
Having N thousand small ISPs, and hundreds of small web hosting businesses,
plus dozens of big ISPs and hosting services means there's lots of competition -
if you provide undependable service, people will leave, unless
they're somewhere geographically special or have other special issues.
Most non-huge US ISPs don't have large numbers of physical peering circuits,
but ISPs that use the public exchange points or carrier hotels
often peer with a number of other ISPs, because that either requires
just administrative agreements (on a routed exchange point)
or additional PVCs (on an ATM exchange point.)
Some exchange points work by everybody peering with the exchange
rather than with each other, but it's a similar effect.

TEMPEST really refers to two kinds of technology -
keeping equipment quiet, and reading signals from not-quiet-enough
equipment.  The former category is the main thing that would
apply to private citizens, and it's not addressed here.
I suppose there's also the issue of whether police can use
evidence eavesdropped by private citizens, but there are
probably similar cases dealing with cameras.
Agreed.  The decision sounded like it there'd have been no issue
if the police had obtained a warrant first - after all,
they could have no-knocked on the door and come in,
if they'd had any actual evidence.
And they could have lurked outside the house watching for
suspicious-looking visitors if they thought this was commercial.
And unfortunately, just because the guy won in the Supremes
doesn't mean he gets his dope back :-)

@_subject: ORBS sucked into a black hole! 
ORBS's relay hunter software was often extremely aggressive,
pounding heavily on systems trying to see if it could send test spam.
Some ISPs and systems disliked that kind of rudeness and blocked them,
and that was enough to get you blacklisted.
At one point, MAPS was blocking ORBS, so MAPS users all blocked ORBS
         (Mommy, mommy, he's on MY side of the room!  Make him stop!)
so you didn't even have to be trying to block them to get blacklisted.
Also, harboring spammers can be much harder to verify -
some places let them operate out in the open,
while some expected their spammers to be stealthier,
and it's hard to tell a stealthy tolerated customer
from a stealthy not-caught-yet policy-violating customer,
especially from an ISP who's mostly in the colocation business
so the spammer may be a customer of a customer or
a customer of a customer of a customer.
Plus colocation or hosting customers may leave open relays
out of ignorance, or by mistake,
or because they don't have a good technical alternative,
and their ISPs may get crap from ORBS.
And that doesn't even count ISPs who have strong and enforced
anti-spamming policies but have occasional sales people who
are clueless about spam and willing to write contracts allowing violations -
my employer got embarassed by that a year or so
and the VP had to yell at everybody to make sure it doesn't happen again :-)
MAPS wasn't always the most flexibly-responding system,
but at least you could negotiate with them.
Also, spamming is active misbehaviour, while open relays aren't -
they're just something that's too easily abused, and closing them
reduces the tools available to spammers.
It's too bad - it was much easier for me to send email from my laptop
when I could use the same mail relay regardless of whether I was
connected to the LAN at work or dialed into my ISP,
because "att.com" would forward my mail either way.
(Then when that got closed, "research.att.com" would...)
Now I have to switch mail servers depending on where I am.

It depends.  If you're talking about obscenity on the radio or internet,
or commercial speech like tobacco advertising, then, no, the
First Amendment isn't about that, it's about protecting political speech.
Of course, if you're talking about election campaign finances,
and whether somebody can spend their own money to promote their
political beliefs, that's a much different story -
elections are *far* too important to allow that sort of thing.
Maybe *I'm* Slim Shady...
Yeah.  The US equivalent, National Public Radio and its relatives,
used to be a reasonably adequate knockoff of the BBC and CBC.
Over the last few years, it's increasingly turned into a
propaganda engine for corporatism, brought to you by
a grant from Archer Daniels Midland, Big Oil 1, Big Oil 2, etc.,
with less of the interesting in-depth foreign coverage.
This has unfortunately also happened to Pacifica Radio,
the socialist network that used to carry obviously slanted but
interesting coverage of international activities.
But it's now getting about 15% of its funding from the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting, in spite of its previous claims
to not take corporate advertising (which would affect its content),
and it's gotten watered down to the point that it not only would
probably not fight the Seven Dirty Words You Can't Say On TV case,
it's become almost as insipid as PBS and the Capitalist Broadcasting System.

JYA is very definitely a Journalist, but in a newer

Declan, on the other hand, works for one or more traditional press
companies, so he fits in the Journalist bureaucratic pigeonhole,
even though some of his press companies are mainly online.
While I mostly agree with Tim's views that the First Amendment
doesn't carve out special civil rights for journalists,
governments do generally distinguish between categories like
"works for a big enough press company that we might get flamed
in front of a large audience if we harass him, and they've got lawyers",
unlike journalists who work for small rantzines (no slack for them),
or freelancers like JYA.
Still, it might be fun to harass the Feds for not following their
own procedures in subpoenaing JYA, though that's pretty irrelevant
to the case itself since they're mostly Bureau CYA rather than due process.

NSA COMPUTER UPGRADE - [The Wall Street Journal, B1.]  What does it take to
send an e-mail to all 38,000 employees at the government's premier computing
center, the supersecret National Security Agency?  "An act of God," says the
agency's director since 1999, Lt. Gen. Michael Hayden.  The NSA, he
discovered to his chagrin last year, has 68 e-mail systems.  He has three
computers on his desk - none of which can communicate with the others.  To
deal with those frustrations, Hayden is now plunging into one of the U.S.
government's biggest information-technology outsourcing deals ever.  More
than 15 companies, including AT&T, Computer Sciences, IBM, General Dynamics
and OAO, have formed three teams to compete for a contract set to be valued
at as much as $5 billion over 10 years.  Requests for proposals went out
last week; the winner will be chosen by July.  Project Groundbreaker, as the
job is called, will be a curious venture by any measure.  The winning
consortium will take over running the NSA's office-technology
infrastructure, including thousands of desktop computers and a Medusa-like
tangle of software and internal communications systems.  Hayden describes
the current setup as "anarchic, convoluted and complex."  It is a holdover
from the days when the NSA, for security reasons, was broken into dozens of
sealed-off compartments.  Each bought its own computers, developed its own
software and built its own networks, intentionally cut off from the rest of
the organization.  Hayden now wants to open the place up, at least
internally.  Whoever wins the Groundbreaker contract will have to meld the
current mess into one seamless network, so that for the first time the
agency can move around top-secret files as any company would, but without
fear of an external security breach.  If Groundbreaker succeeds, industry
experts predict it could set off a wave of other big outsourcing deals
within the federal government.  Likely next candidates include the
departments of Energy and Defense, and even the Central Intelligence Agency.
"This will set the standard for how all similar deals proceed," says Thomas
Robinson, president of CSC's Defense Group, which is leading one team that
also includes General Dynamics and Verizon.  The leaders of the other two
competing consortia are AT&T and OAO.

CYBER LAW JOURNAL
Virginia Court's Decision in Online 'John Doe' Case Hailed by Free-Speech
By CARL KAPLAN
Cyber Law Journal
In what was apparently the first Internet defamation case to involve both
an anonymous plaintiff and anonymous defendants, the Supreme Court of
Virginia refused to grant an unidentified company access to America
Online's confidential subscriber information unless the firm agreed to
reveal its identity.
The plaintiff in the case, named in court documents only as "Anonymous
Publicly Traded Company," dropped its efforts to subpoena AOL after
agreeing on Wednesday to the dismissal of a related case in Indiana.
Douglas M. Palais, the lawyer for the plaintiff company, declined to
explain why his client had dropped its case.
While the litigation is no longer pending, the ruling handed down in
Virginia could set a precedent for similar lawsuits across the country. In
its decision, the Virginia court said that an anonymous plaintiff could be
given subpoena power only if it would suffer exceptional harm, such as a
social stigma or extraordinary economic retaliation, as a result of
revealing its identity.

Just because a crime is Federal doesn't mean the FBI will be involved;
depends on what you did, whether it's known at the time you did it that
there were Federal crimes involved, whether the investigation is something
that local cops can handle just fine or that need Federal help,
whether the Feds are FBI, DEA, BATF, IRS, or other Federal agencies, etc.
Sometimes the crime involves an actual victim and a crime scene,
and it may be obvious enough from the crime scene or victim complaint
that there are Federal crimes involved and enough complexity or
inter-state activity that the local cops will bring in Feds.
But sometimes the local cops don't need Federal help.
Also, sometimes the "crime" doesn't involve a victim -
it's private transactions between parties who aren't complaining
about it as long as neither party rips off the other party.
Sometimes those "crimes" are discovered by prying local cops,
sometimes by prying Feds, and sometimes the activity starts off
victimless, there's a dispute, and in the absence of the
ability to use the legal system to resolve conflict,
the parties resort to the pre-Common-Law Anglo-Saxon method of
Trial By Combat to resolve the problem, and the cops
discover that the participant has become deceased due to
issues of Interstate Commerce, or recognize him from The Files,
and bring in the FBI for help.
And sometimes the criminals are the BATF, and the FBI are
brought in to cover up, er, resolve the situation.

Cryptographically *un*interesting.
         > [Good discussion of key lengths, deleted...]
The microfluid computers were solving small instances of NP problems;
larger volumes would let them solve larger instances, but not
blazingly large, though you could get respectably large by using
an ocean-full of the stuff.  That gets you a few extra bits of solution.
But it's not solving general-purpose computing - it's solving
specialized problems which may be somewhat useful for small
instances of NP-hard problems, so it may be useful for
possibly-NP-hard problems like factoring and discrete logs.
Adding a few bits of key length to those problems is less annoying
than adding them to most symmetric-key algorithms, where
there's more likely to be structure to the key length
(e.g. adding a few key bits to RC4 is no problem,
as long as you're below 255, but adding them to DES doesn't work.)
Judging from the abstract, it's still cool stuff,
even if it's not all that practical.

How fast they trace Yahoo is an open question -
If you care, find an anonymizer to read your webmail through.
I'm reading off-line, but the IP address is probably that of
the machine at the internet cafe you're using -
depending on how organized the cafe and someone tracing you are,
they may be able to find you quickly, or not.
For instance, if you're at joesinternetcafe.com,
Joe's Internet Cafe, 1234 5th street, San Francisco,
and Joe's system adminstrator can tell that
.63 is the table in the corner, you may be toast.
On the other hand, if your IP address is a
NAT box on a DSL line connected to Pac Bell Internet,
at a chain of coffeeshops staffed by non-technical baristas,
         "I don't know how the router thing works.  Want donuts?"
and you're a 17-year-old kid in a room full of
15-20-year-old kids playing Quake, you'll have plenty of time
to boogie out of there before the cops show up,
or certainly before they figure out it was you -
unless you've threatened to nuke Washington now,
any investigation will be after the fact,
so the real issue is whether you paid by credit card or cash
and whether any name you used is traceable to you.

Even a nymserver doesn't do that - joepseudonym at foo.nymserver.net

just to have an address on that server.
The features in Netscape and Eudora that let you pick your From: info

@_subject: Mr. Choate, an important message  from Justice Scalia.... 
Discussion by Jim Choate, Declan, and Aimee -
Marbury vs. Madison was an entertaining power grab by the Supremes,
but while it may not have been explicitly planned by the bunch of
politicians who wrote the messy compromise that's the Constitution,
the Constitutional requirement that there be a hierarchy of courts
with one Supreme Court means that something like it should happen.
If you don't like the idea that the Supreme's job is interpreting
the constitutionality of laws made by the legislature,
their job at minimum involves deciding appeals in specific cases,
and it's possible under Constutionally implied-but-unspecified
conditions to appeal cases up the hierarchy.
Some of those cases will involve questions where a law made by Congress
or by a state (at least after the 14th amendment)
conflicts with the majority of Supreme Court judges' opinions
about what the Constitution (and amendments) directly states
or with what they believe are fundamental civil rights
which the 9th and 10th amendments confirm may exist even though they
are not specifically enumerated.
So even if, in a Choatian World, they couldn't say
"We're the Supreme Arbiters Of The Meaning Of The Constitution",
they can still say "We're the top of the judicial hierarchy,
and we say that X is a bad law, and will rule in any case that
is appealed to us that that the accused is not guilty
and award legal costs to the accused."
Under common law, throwing out cases of unjust laws is not only
the job of the jury, it's also the job of the judge
(though the judge also works for the King, and it may also
be his job to enforce unjust laws.)
Lower courts don't like getting overturned, so they'd generally
stay in line given a ruling like that, and if not,
the accused can spend the costs of the appeal and win.
And since most courts generally follow precedents,
once the Supremes have announced that X is a bad law,
they'll generally stick to it for quite a while,
or at least until the political climate changes and
they decide some case doesn't quite fit the conditions
that the precedent was set under, or weasel-word around it,
or decide to do a rare break with tradition and issue a
contradictory opinion.

Mask laws in the US, when they're not about bank robbers,

claims to have religious content - they're out burning crosses -
but that hasn't stopped enforcement that often.
Islam is highly varied - some of the Arab and Persian cultures
are heavily into veils for women, some aren't.  Not sure about Indian.
The Taliban have recently been requiring that men grow beards
(I'm not sure if they require long ones or if short is ok.)
Some of the Arab traditional headdress for men has the
relatively lightweight kaffiyehs, like Yassir Arafat wears,
while some go for heavier, more concealing coverage such as the
turban-like things the Tuareg and other deep-desert folks wear.
That doesn't have religious significance - it's about sunburn and
sand and wind and heat and cold, and immensely practical stuff
if you live in that climate, as well as culturally familiar,
just as cowboy hats and bandannas are sometimes practical
and sometimes just for style.
Many of the Sikh turbans cover the beard as well as the hair.
And Sikhs do get hassled at airports.
You can always go with Nun outfits.  It's easier to get away with

Which Gubmint? CA Gov. Gray Davis appears to have taken the FBI's warning
seriously enough to go out on a limb and announce that they'd
gotten a bit more specific than "Be Afraid, Be Very Afraid,
Terrorists are Hiding under the Bed and we WON'T TELL YOU WHICH BED
they're hiding under because that would give away our sources and methods!
But This Time it's Rilly Cred-a-Bull!"  And I think they were only
saying that because Jay Leno was giving them a hard time about
doing a second no-specifics-attached iteration of "Wolf! Wolf!"
and they were worried the sheeple might not fall for it.
Of course, that's entirely separate from the problem of whether
there *are* wolves, and whether they're more likely to
opportunistically take advantage of the current wave of terrorism
to do their own, or whether they're more likely to lie low because
there are too many cops running around who might catch them,
plus too many other people who might get credit for their work,
or whether some of the wolves work for or at least with the Feds.
I'd be surprised if you couldn't do the job with an
OKC-sized truck bomb - stop it at an appropriate point on the bridge,
have the engine compartment smokebomb go off to create plausible deniability,
hop into the car your co-conspirators are driving just in front of you,
and drive away.  If your smokebomb is good enough, and you do it during
low traffic, you might get off the bridge without getting caught.
The question is how much you trust your backup co-conspirator
who's sitting at the vista point with the radio transmitter....
If they're not keeping all trucks off of the bridges, they can't stop it.
The Feds have apparently decided that they should drop their policy of
helping the Peruvian Air Force shoot down suspected drug dealing planes,
like that US missionary and her baby they took out this spring
(shot them down and machine-gunned them as they swam out of the plane.)
Not because extra-judicial executions are wrong, of course,
or because shooting down civilian airplanes is terrorism,
but because their accuracy has been low enough to cause embarassment.

Topic:		Detecting Steganographic Content on the Internet
Speaker:	Niels Provos
About the talk:
Steganography is used to hide the occurrence of communication.
Recent suggestions in US newspapers indicate that terrorists use
steganography to communicate in secret with their accomplices. In
particular, images on the Internet were mentioned as the
communication medium. While the newspaper articles sounded very
dire, none substantiated these rumors.
To determine whether there is steganographic content on the
Internet, this talk presents a detection framework that includes
tools to retrieve images from the world wide web and
automatically detect whether they might contain steganographic
content. To ascertain that hidden messages exist in images, the
detection framework includes a distributed computing framework
for launching dictionary attacks hosted on a cluster of loosely
coupled workstations. We have analyzed two million images
downloaded from eBay auctions but have not been able to find a
single hidden message.

@_subject: Maine National Guard bars Green Party leader from flying 
It's one thing for a minimum wage ArentSoBright security guard
to be concerned about the people carrying scary computer parts.
(Hi, Dave!)  That's a problem, but it's a one-off.
This is something different - the Guardsman is sworn to uphold the
Constitution, yet he's violating someone's rights in what
appears to be a pre-planned retailiation for her political beliefs.
That's a one-strike firing offense, like a cop getting caught stealing.
The appropriate action is for the Guard's probably non-existent
equivalent of Police Department Internal Affairs to find out
who else was involved in this offense, and what level of pre-planning
really happened - was it truly a random thing?  If it was political,
that's also sufficiently illegal that the Uniform Code of Military
Justice requires soldiers to disobey, and failing to do so is another
one-strike-you're-out kind of thing.
Does the Guardsman only deserve firing, after an appropriate
court-martial, or does he also deserve civilian punishment?
The separate issue is the airline - the airline employee clearly
deserves a reprimand, and whoever told all the other airlines that
they don't want this Green Party person flying does as well.
They sold her a ticket, and violated their contract to carry her,
and the issue of whether it really was safety-related or whether
a really egregious breach of contract is a question for a court.

This is the Pentagon claiming that the story about Delta Force getting shot up

Seymour Hersh is a journalist who's annoyed the Pentagon for decades,
printing stories they don't want printed.
This one they're denying before it even hits paper...
Also, I don't see any evidence that he "strongly debunked" the story;
he flamed it aggressively, but to strongly debunk something
you need facts, not just assertions.  You also need to have read the
story you're debunking, which the spokescritter indicates he hasn't.
The phrase " My guess is and my belief is that" also makes it clear that
he doesn't know the facts of what happened, though he does indicate
that US forces had a helicopter accident and some parachute accidents,
and comes close to implying some problems with friendly fire,
because he'd rather admit that than admit that The Enemy shot US soldiers.

@_subject: Black Unicorn's talk at Saturday's meeting 
In Part One of "Squeezing the Jello" we covered the basics of the production
of Cocaine HCl. We touched on the economic incentives to produce cocaine,
down to the level of the peasant farmer. We also introduced some of the
major players in the Medellin and Cali Cartels based in Columbia, examined
their development into the "godfathers of cocaine" and discussed the
challenges they faced in producing a market and distribution network for
cocaine in the United States. We examined the evolution of the cocaine
market and the increasing challenges to the transportation and logistic
segments of international narcotics trafficking starting primarily in the
Reagan era. We discovered the first hints of the adaptive nature of cocaine
smuggling and the narcotics trafficking empires, now risen in power and
influence both in Latin America and in the United States. Finally, we
discussed the increasing technological and military involvement in the "war
on drugs" and the changes in the cocaine trade, including the fall of the
great cartels, that followed those developments. We ended with a
description of the status quo of the cocaine trade today.
In Part Two, we will review some of the things we learned in Part One. We
will examine the cocaine trade again with an emphasis on its economic
impacts and changes over the last three decades. We will go over the major
players in the trade and their eventual fates. We will transition to the
current state of affairs in the cocaine trade and draw some conclusions
about the effectiveness of enforcement efforts given the evolved and
advanced nature of the international narcotics trade. Finally, we will
examine in detail the fates of the large players in the trade, the missteps
they may have made and how the trade has evolved. The talk will end with
some predications about the direction of the cocaine trade, the prospects
for stopping the import of cocaine into the United States and the lessons we
might learn about underground economies from the more than three decades of
experience the international narcotics smuggling trade has given us.
Methods we might use to apply these lessons to cypherpunky projects will be
outlined and some related and future projects will be introduced to the

particularly India's restrictions on their non-convertible rupee.
It's approximately the same system that the Italians ran
so successfully during the Middle Ages - have offices in
multiple cities in Italy and Spain, and there's enough traffic
in different directions that the deposits and withdrawals
in each city are mostly balanced, so the risky and expensive
job of shipping gold and silver between cities only needs to be done
on the net differences, not on the much larger gross,
and depending on the level of trust between the different parties,
you can float for quite a while and more easily absorb the
occasional loss to pirates or shipwreck.
This market's a bit more directional, perhaps, but it's dealing
with cultures that have been doing lots of trading for millenia,
and understand the value of repeat business, so it can adapt to
the current needs, and adjusts prices to reflect the costs of
moving the net transfers and the current risk value of trust.

@_subject: firing a high-powered combat rifle in an airport could do 
There was a recent article on Posse Comitatus by some military lawyer
that was mentioned on some list in the last month.
IANAJAG, so I don't know how valid it is, but he asserts, probably correctly, that:
1) Posse Comitatus is just a *law*, not a Constitutional clause,
         not a court decision - Congress made it, so they can change it,
         any time 51% of them think it's a politically useful thing to do,
         as long as they can talk the President into it,
         and most Presidents aren't all that averse to being given more power.
2) In practice, Posse Comitatus has evolved into a procedural issue,
         not a separation-of-powers issue - the military can't be used
         for domestic law enforcement, at all, for any reason, ever,
         unless they're asked properly on the approriate 3-part-carbon form,
         with the blanks filled in neatly and a signature at the bottom,
         in which case it's just fine if the military brass agree.
         The War On Politically Incorrect Drugs has a lot to do with this,
         but it's been happening anyway.
3) P.C. isn't even an ancient law - it evolved after the War Between The States
         (you could look up the date, I think 1870s).
         So it didn't apply to Northern Aggression, whether you accept the
         Nationalist-Manifest-Destiny position that the Southerners
         were a bunch of rebels who should be stomped down to protect unity,
         which wasn't bothered by legal niceties that weren't written yet,
         or the pro-independence position that free people don't need to rebel,
         they can simply secede, in which case the Confederacy was a foreign
         country that the Union Army was invading, and P.C. wouldn't have          even if it had been written by then.
Back in the 60s, during the race riots, it was pretty common to have
National Guard troops on the streetcorners to intimidate blacks.
Even in Wilmington, Delaware.  Sometimes they were also used on
student protestors.  Not the kind of thing you'd expect in a free country,
but this was America.

@_subject: AGAINST ID CARDS 
It's a really, *really* bad idea.
It's politically much easier to successfully oppose an obviously bad thing,
like National ID cards and other internal pass laws,
than to successfully oppose incremental changes in existing systems.
And forcing states to use uniform practices means that you
can't find a place to have a driver's license merely
indicate your driving skills, as opposed to hundreds of other uses.
For instance, collecting SSNs for driver's licenses,
which makes it possible to correlate drivers databases with
most other databases in the country, was done back in the 80s,
and in many states the SSN is printed on the DL or IS the DL number.
(The Federal Privacy Act had little effect on this process -
it's just a law, so future laws can easily change it, and did so.)
Another big change in DL policies was the requirement for
citizenship papers to get permission to drive.
Here in California that was largely done to prevent the
clear and present danger of people speaking Spanish while driving,
and many other states have jumped on the harassing-immigrants bandwagon.
Since many jobs need driver's licences (or at least transportation),
immigrants now have a major financial incentive to get them,
so the price and supply of corruption in motor vehicle departments
has gone up substantially.  Before this, the main people who needed
high-quality driver's licenses were convicted bad drivers
who were trying to dodge the system, and that was easier to stop.
(There was also a demand for fake ID for underage drinkers,
but low-quality fakes are fine for that, and they don't need to be
Driver's licenses have increasingly become tools of social control -
the common excuse is "deadbeat dads", and in many states
conviction for drug possession offenses also gets them suspended.
Until 9/11, you could still routinely travel without government ID,
though many airlines have a policy of training their people to lie
about "no, that's always been the policy".
ACLU Cards with pictures would have helped that - don't leave home
without one - but I doubt we'll have that freedom again for a while.
New Jersey, BTW, encodes lots of information in the DL number -
the S8235 at the beginning of mine was a Soundex for "Stewart",
the 5 digits at the end encoded birthdate and I think
race or eye color, and some of the middle six digits may have also
encoded that, though some were just serial numbers.
It provides some security against licenses forged by
people who don't know the rules.
         [They're also listed in plaintext.  The forms let you
         update your address, but not most of the personal data,
         so my weight still shows what I weighed when I was 22.]
As long as there's a driver's license number printed on the card,
it's a unique ID for database lookups attached to your name.
If the other certifications are encrypted, that means that
*you* don't know what they say, but cops who run the card
through a computer lookup will - and cops will *have* to
run the card through a computer lookup to use them,
whereas now they can just look at them if they want.
If you could get a card that just had your picture and the
certifications, and not your name or address,
that might be an improvement, but it ain't gonna happen.
And meanwhile, in many states you've got some flexibility about
whether the license lists the address where you get snailmail
or the address where you sleep or the address where you own land.
Expect any uniform standards to erase that.
What can the ability to do database lookups do?
Well, if the signatures indicate that you're black,
or a Registered Republican Voter, or a Welfare Recipient,
or a Registered Drug Offender, it's much easier for
anybody who wants to target you do do so.
If the databases are only accessible to authorized users,
that increases the demand for bribable authorized users,
especially if the expanded set of uses expands the set of
authorized users.  It's possible to keep the different sets
of information separate, if there's the technical skill
and political will to do so, but there's little enough of the former
and none of the latter among the kinds of people who'd
make the requirements for that kind of system.

That was interesting.  Today's SF Chronicle also has another article
on satellites, mainly focusing on the technology,
which is a lot better than during the First Gulf War.
Much of the content comes from GlobalSecurity.org,
a non-profit space and defense analysis center,
and there are also pointers to SpaceImaging.com.
Resolutions are better, and battlefield commanders can get color pictures,
weather images, infrared coverage which is good for checking bomb damage,
radar images, and faster responses for everything.
The article talks about 1-foot resolution; some other articles have
said there's technology as good as 10cm, though that's
mainly for narrow-focus pictures, not wide-area.
By contrast, First Gulf War images were mainly 10meter.
French Spot satellites have 1-meter resolution,
and Ikonos was at least that good before the military did the
exclusivity deal.   A new commercial satellite called
Quickbird is being launched later this week by DigitalGlobe Corp.
It should do 2 feet for black&white and eight feet for color and infrared.
One of the Internet map sites, I think Mapquest, also has
aerial photos for many US areas.  I'm not sure if they're satellite
or if they're airplane-based.  It's good enough to clearly make out

David Lesher  sent the following to CYBERIA-L at LISTSERV.AOL.COM
National Journal's Technology Daily
PM Edition
October 16, 2001
HEADLINE: PRIVACY: FBI To Require ISPs To Reconfigure E-mail Systems
PHOENIX -- The FBI is in the process of finalizing technical
guidelines that would require all Internet service providers (ISPS) to
reconfigure their e-mail systems so they could be more easily
accessible to law enforcers. The move, to be completed over the next
two months, would cause ISPs to act as phone companies do to comply
with a 1994 digital-wiretapping law. "They are in the process of
developing a very detailed set of standards for how to make packet
data" available to the FBI, said Stewart Baker, an attorney at Steptoe
& Johnson who was formerly the chief counsel to the National Security
Agency (NSA).
The proposal is not a part of the anti-terrorism legislation currently
before Congress because the agency is expected to argue that the
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) already
grants it the authority to impose the requirement, Baker said. He
added that some ISPs already meet the requirements.
Baker, who frequently represents Internet companies being asked to
conduct electronic surveillance for the FBI, made the revelation
Tuesday in a panel discussion at the Agenda 2002 conference here on
how the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks are likely to affect the technology
industry and civil liberties. He elaborated on the plan in an
Such a stance could result in considerable cost to many ISPs, and it
would constitute a reversal of previous government policy, which held
that ISPs are not subject to CALEA's requirements. But Baker also said
"it has been a long-term goal of the FBI and is not just a reaction to
Sept. 11."
Mitchell Kapor, chairman of the Open Source Application Foundation and
a founder of Lotus Development, also spoke on the panel. Kapor also
started the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and has been a vocal
advocate of Internet privacy. EFF played a significant role in the
CALEA debate, and divisions over whether to support that law led to a
split of the organization.
"Under the cover of people's outrage [over the terrorist attacks] and
desire for revenge, lots of things that have been defeated before have
been brought back in [to the anti-terrorism legislation] without a
demonstration that the lack of appropriate law is a problem," Kapor
said in an interview. But on the whole, Kapor and Baker shared more
common ground on the acceptability of new electronic surveillance than
they had in the past, with both expressing the view that now is a time
for calm reconsideration of positions rather than butting horns over
the details of how civil liberties would be curtailed by an
anti-terrorism bill.
"I find myself more in the middle than I used to because my identity
in life is not as a civil liberties advocate," Kapor said. "Part is
being an American and a world citizen." Baker said it was entirely
appropriate for the FBI to conduct far more surveillance.
"What has changed [since Sept. 11] is the view of the technology
community," Baker said. "I used to get calls like, 'How can I beat the
NSA?'" said Baker. "Now, people call and say, 'I have this great idea
that would help NSA,' or, 'I want to go volunteer and do outreach on
behalf of the FBI or NSA.' There is a real change of people's view
about who the bad guys are."

English and American languages do have a lot of fundamental structure,
including a variety of competing structures,
but they're fundamentally usage-based, not centrally-controlled like French.
(And at that, French central control of language was merely a successful imposition of Parisian culture and language on the rest of the country,
intended to stomp out resistance from Provencal, Breton, and other
regional languages and dialects, during the periods when various
kings and dictators and emperors were imposing their control on the

My brother was a Teamster once, when he had a job in a warehouse.
He decided that if he was going to have to pay union dues,
he was going to work towards making the union local have some
actual control over where the political-contribution part of the dues went
instead of letting the Teamsters national bosses control it.
(Do not taunt Happy Fun Teamster!  He had a good time messing with them...)
I'm strongly opposed to laws requiring companies to deal with unions,
but also to right-to-work laws that forbid companies from doing
exclusive deals with unions, except insofar as they're counteracting
federal mandatory-union laws.  After growing up watching Philadelphia TV,
it took me a long time to be willing to view unions as anything other
than the violent thugs who kept burning down construction sites
and beating non-union workers and excluding incorrect racial groups
and helping Mafiosi shake down businesses, though some of the businesses
also helped Mafiosi shake down unions and hired their own goons
(both blue-suited and free-market) to beat up union members as well -
government and Pinkerton thugs have been just as violent and murderous,
particularly in the coal mine strikes and northwestern lumber strikes,
and the government has occasionally provided National Guard strikebreakers
to do scab labor as well as to beat up strikers, which is
inappropriate in a free market.
Politics aside, though, I've dealt with construction unions and
communications workers unions, and
sometimes unions have been able to provide good service both for
their members and for companies that hire them -
you can go to the appropriate union hall and get well-trained workers
to do the projects you need, and they provide workers with a certain
amount of mutual insurance, often including medical and pension benefits.
It's not that much different than what many of the Silicon Valley
technical body-shops provide, except that the internal dispute-resolution
methods are much more strictly seniority-based than competence-based,
and it's more collectivist than individualist, but that's not as
inappropriate as you'd think for industrial-age businesses that
need large groups of workers for mass-production work rather than
individual artisans.
Business hiring is a process of negotiation in a market,
in which all sides are trying to maximize their return,
just as buying and selling are.
Capitalists are out to make money, and so are workers,
and if forming a union is an effective negotiating tool
for the workers to get more of the pie than they'd get individually,
then I wish them good luck, just as if forming partnerships
or other kinds of business alliances are an effective business tool
for business owners, I wish them good luck too -
as long as they stick to moral methods, rather than
threatening violence against strikebreakers or strikers
or hiring politicians to give them an unfair advantage.
Employee Stock Ownership Plans have also been an effective method
of aligning the interests of unions and companies -
they tend to encourage cooperation by leading both sides to
recognize their mutual intersts.  Of course, when you start
giving workers stock, and telling them they're "empowered",
you find they not only care about the company's success,
they really lose patience for upper-management cluelessness,
and in a unionized company, sometimes this is more visible to
clueless upper managers than in a non-unionized company
where the pointy-haired ones can ignore their "empowered" workers.
Collectivist anti-management rhetoric, greedy union bosses,
and various other cluelessness and abuses by unions sometimes
cause employers to go broke or generally keep the pie smaller
than if they were willing to share the wealth and do the
win-win strategy of growing their market or at least their market share,
and eventually Darwin will get those people; same holds true for
greedy, stupid, and short-sighted business-owners or managers.
Unfortunately, this often turns into a lose-lose situation,
especially when organizational conflict causes a business to be
too inflexible to adapt to changing market conditions.
Back when part of the company I was in had some threat of becoming
unionized, some of my co-workers joked about how we ought to
respond by forming a Wobbly local, and run it against the CWA/IBEW/etc.
The IWW may have a bunch of economically clueless class-warfare rhetoric
about the worker class never having common interests with the boss class,
but they can be pretty individualist and they certainly don't
put up with greedy union bosses trying to push them around.
(One guy from another union referred to them as the "I Won't Work" society.)
They do have an unfortunate history of violence as well,
but hey, if we've got to be part of One Big Union,
might as well have it be One Big Highly Disorganized Union,
and it seems to really torque off the Teamsters.

I normally use Mozilla (though I'm finding that 0.9.5 crashes a bit more than 0.9.4.)
The one main gripe I've had about Mozilla has been that a number of
plug-ins either don't work at all or have installers that get confused
if your machine has both a Netscape 6.x and a Mozilla on it,
and tends not to install itself where the Mozilla can find it.
I use IE for pages that have too much broken Javascript to survive on Mozilla,
or for pages that have plugins that my Mozilla doesn't support.

Yee-hah!  I'm glad that finally got worked out!
Well, anywhere the phone jacks and dialing standards are compatible.
You probably want to stop at Fry's or some overpriced airport shop
and get a collection of different shaped phone jacks and alligator clips,
if you're taking them to places with Funky Phone Standards.
Depends on whether the fire sale includes intellectual property
or just parts.   That's certainly a call for companies in this line of work
to (preferably) do a "read-only open source" if they're not doing real or at minimum do a source code / design escrow.
At the time they started, AES wasn't finalized.
The main negatives about 3DES are that it's slow and ugly,
plus it takes a bit too much code space and needs 168bits of key,
but it's incredibly thoroughly studied and everybody trusts it.
And 2048-bit Diffie-Hellman provides plenty of key bits,
and when you're doing voice at 4800-24000kbps ( = 600-3000 Bytes/sec),
the encryption isn't your big horsepower consumer,
compared to the voice compression, and even if you do compression in ASICs,
you still need to keep enough CPU around to do the Diffie-Hellman in
reasonable amounts of time and handle connection handshaking,
so 3DES isn't any big strain.

Is Dr. Evil's concern with loopback just the speed?
(Plus the ugly minimal user interface, which is a job for a script.)
Machines are enough faster these days that I'd think the
only places that's a big hit, other than database apps,
are swap space, and you can mostly fix that by buying enough RAM.
If you've got applications that insist on putting data in /etc or /var,
or for log files in general, you have to be careful about the order the
system starts in.  And if you're worried about people seeing your config files
that might show who you communicate with, you could go paranoid about this.
IPSEC secrets may be a concern, if stealing/cloning the disk lets someone
forge your identity.

This isn't the kind of thing you back off on, once you've started,

The DC Metro is one of the nicer subways systems in the country.
And for both NYC and DC, the subway definitely beats most other
transportation methods - neither city could support even the
parking needs for their residents or workers if everyone drove,
and busses aren't managed in a way that they could replace subways,
particularly because even with many more of them,
they'd be stuck in traffic that the subways can avoid.
Besides, especially in NYC, there are so many interesting people

Analog shouldn't really be cheaper than digital these days.
A digital cellphone with roughly the same parts costs ~$100,
and includes radio parts as well.
The big costs of a device like this are
- amortizing development costs
- packaging for smallness and cuteness
- designing for low power use.
A sound card costs $5, a modem costs $10, a PC104 card is $$25-50;
you should be able to integrate them on a board for a similar cost,
as long as you don't mind a somewhat slow public-key step
(or paying to license elliptic-curve algorithms),
and if you don't mind the power and space from general-purpose designs,
i.e. a simple, ugly, AC-powered board like the
never-finished "Harmless Little Project".
Real designs would eliminate most of the inter-card glue,
and cut down on unused interfaces, and eventually put stuff in ASICs.
But you have to run enough volume to amortize the development costs.
If you want to do off-the-shelf today, probably the easiest choice
is to start with a Compaq iPaq - they're about $500, and burn batteries
too fast to be really ideal, but they're fast enough (unlike Palm)
and include audio hardware (don't know if it's full-duplex),
and you can hang modems on them.
Some of the scrambler descriptions sounded like they were digital,
not analog, but still had wimpy homemade crypto.
My memories of the device that used Bell Labs crypto algorithms
are that it was *probably* the "commercial-sale-approved weak crypto"
version of the STU-III that we did back in the late 80s,
and if so it's weaker than DES, but I haven't actually seen it.
(We did multiple versions on that platform - the STU-III used
NSA-supplied crypto chips, the Federal-Unclassified-Use version
used single-DES, and I don't remember if the commercial one was
exportable or not.)

One of the fun things about the internet is that

information is never forgotten unless it's useful.
There are flames I wrote on Usenet back in the early 80s archived;
if only it were as easy to find the useful stuff.
As the song says, "C'mon Joe, you can always change your name".
If you did know, you'd have written to the people who run the
archives, not the people on the mailing list you once spammed,
not that either will erase it.  And there's more than one archive.
Looks like the Mitch's original "remove-me" request didn't make it to the lne.com list,
but it's in the inet-one archives.   Tim's reply included the spam.
The address of Mitch Shoemaker, the spammer, looks very much like
the address of
SHOEMAKER'S AUTO BODY  82  Iron St Rear N  Bloomsburg PA 17815 (717) 784-3585
which probably explains why none of the four listings in Anywho
have the same address as Mitch the spammer.
Shoemaker, Angie  90 Alexis Dr  BLOOMSBURG, PA 17815  570-389-1834
Shoemaker, Charles E  345 E 8 St  BLOOMSBURG, PA 17815  570-784-2690

Making biodiesel from virgin oil scales well, since you can use
non-food-grade oils, but there's still a substantial ecological effect
of converting land from non-farming or food-farming to energy-farming.
Waste vegetable oil has a much different scaling ability -
until you get most fast-food french-fry leftovers used for fuel oil,
it scales up really well, but after that it hits the wall.
Ethanol has similar problems - you need to grow a lot of sugary or starchy which not only displace food crops (having similar land needs),
but at least in third-world countries tend to be grown by
slash-and-burn agriculture, which rapidly destroys land, usually rainforest.
On the other hand, for an area that doesn't have oil,
the tradeoff between wasting farmland for energy crops and
using it for export crops to buy energy from outside could go either way.
Of course, when the "area" has government boundaries defining it,
especially in the third world, there tends to be a huge amount of
social policy and/or corruption distorting the market prices.
But sometimes you can exploit other governments' corrupt social policies,
e.g. grow cocaine or opium and buy oil or food or toys with the profits.

(Brad spaced on the title....  brad at templetons.com )
This is Brad Templeton from the EFF.  This Wednesday I'm moderating a
panel at Jeff Pulver's semi-annual conference on Presence and Instant
Messaging.   It's a smallish (couple of hundred) conference where you'll
see most of the commercial players in instant messaging, with the very
notable exception of AOL.
However, having attended this conference I have found that most of the
people there pay little attention to issues of security and privacy in
the IM world.  Sometimes for real reasons (most IM is forced by NAT and
firewalls to be routed through central servers) but often times simply
because they haven't bothered.
The panel I am moderating is on these topics of Presence and Instant
Messaging, and due to various circumstances, right now I have only 2
other speakers on it, who will speak about the privacy and security work
being done by two standards bodies, the PAM formum, and the IETF SIP working
group.  I have my own talk on the design and political issues, but I can
move a lot of that into my plenary talk later in the day where I want to
get those issues out.
In particular I am interested in technologically interesting projects or
research to allow privacy, encryption and anonymity in instant messaging,
and also in presence data and location-aware devices.  (Part of the
conference is also on location aware services, E911 manadated location-aware
phones etc.)
So I apologize for not asking until today, but if you have done any work
in these areas you would like to talk about briefly, I could have a slot
for you, and get you free attendance at this normally $2,000 conference.
Last time Lenny Foner gave a great talk on his work.

This Wedesday, Oct 31, at 9:45am.  It is at the Marriott in Santa Clara.

@_subject: The Privacy/Untraceability Sweet Spot - tools vs. services 
It's a tough call.  The services model has some obvious advantages -
- business model, if they can develop one successfully,
         to fund enough servers, clients, jurisdictions, and ISPs
         to overcome the inertia, hassle, and dropout factor that
         make it hard to create and sustain a scalable secure system.
         ZKS doesn't appear to have succeeded, but perhaps an expensive
         system for more paranoid users or profitable applications
         (e.g. tax avoidance through jurisdictional arbitrage
         or tax evasion through money laundering) can win.
- potentially higher software and service quality.
- less subject to changing fads, e.g. a Napster failed - will Gnutella?
But it has some serious drawbacks -
- you have to trust the service, unless you can be sure it's designed
         with no way for the operators to trace the users,
         including subtle methods like making sure Usual Suspects
         get connected to compromised remailers.
- centralization makes them attackable - Not everything's as
         centrally controllable as Julf's remailer was,
         but not everybody's as honest as he is about shutting down
         rather than continue service when vulnerable,
         and some governments are much more aggressive than Finland
         at attacking systems.
- business models can fail - Napster Inc., ZKS aren't doing so well.
- specialized markets may produce too small a user community,
         making it possible for eavesdroppers to watch the whole system.
         If there are only 100 players, you can pretty much tell
         who's using it, even if you don't know specifically who's
         talking to whom.  For some target markets, this is ok,
         for instance if you're primarily trying to keep the communications
         patterns private from the other players in your market,
         rather than from outsiders, but for others it fails badly.
For tool-based approaches, the ideal is to at least piggyback on some
existing service, e.g. Apache, or Gnutella/Napster/etc., or ICQ/Jabber/AIM,
so there are a large number of players and lots of cover traffic,
making the system relatively sustainable and tracing difficult.

Infocom Corporation, is a web hosting and computer sales company based in Richardson, Texas,
supporting over 500 clients, particularly Arabic web sites,
which were shut down temporarily during the raid (many are back up now).
Clients include Al-Jazeera television and the newspaper Al-Sharq, both based in Qatar, and
several major Muslim American organizations such as the
Council on American Islamic Relations, the Islamic Society of North America,
the Islamic Association for Palestine and the Holy Land Foundation.
On September 5, the FBI raided them, with a sealed search warrant,
looking for information on terrorist groups.
They also served subpoenas on the Holy Land Foundation,
based across the street, which some of the news articles say
the FBI suspects of having ties to Hamas.

Perform for a video camera today!   Or alternatively, go buy a cheap webcam
and surveil somebody who's already performing (oh, wait, that wasn't what they meant :-)
The EFF announced the following:
Friday, September 7 - International Day of Action Against Video Surveillance
   Join privacy-minded citizens in raising awareness of public video
   surveillance
     Electronic Frontier Foundation ACTION ALERT
     (Issued: Friday, August 31, 2001 / Deadline: Friday, September 7, 2001)
   Introduction:
    On Friday, 7 September 2001, a variety of groups from around the world
    will be collaborating on an international day of autonomous protests
    against the constant, indiscriminate and technologically sophisticated
    video surveillance of public places by both businesses and law
    enforcement agencies, and in favor of the right to privacy, which is a
    fundamental human right. The protests will take the form of short
    skits and plays, the majority of which will take place in front of
    "webcams," so that people all over the world can watch them via the
    Internet.
   What YOU Can Do:
      * If you are concerned about surveillance cameras in your area, and
        would like to get involved in the protests, then see New York's

         Background:
    The proposal reads as follows:
      We propose --
     1. that an international day of action against video surveillance --
        specifically: the constant, indiscriminate and technologically
        sophisticated video surveillance of public places by both
        businesses and and law enforcement agencies -- take place on
        Friday, 7 September 2001;
     2. that people who wish to intensify the struggle to protect and
        strengthen the right to privacy (a fundamental human right) should
        undertake autonomous actions at the local level and in a
        completely de-centralized fashion;
     3. that, if and when possible, at least some of these actions should
        be undertaken in front of webcams that have already been installed
        in public places by private companies that are insensitive or even
        hostile to privacy concerns (in addition to disrupting "business
        as usual" for these companies, the use of webcams will allow the
        entire world to see 7s01 anti-videosurveillance actions as they
        take place);
     4. that all individuals and groups participating in the 7s01 day of
        action keep in touch with at least one of the groups listed below
        and/or each other;
     5. that at least one Web site links to or actually displays images
        from these actions as they take place;
     6. that this proposal should be posted on-line and sent to as many
        people as possible and as soon as possible; and
     7. that this proposal be translated into as many foreign languages as
        possible, but especially French, German, and Italian, for it is in
        France, Belgium, Germany and Italy that the anti-videosurveillance
        struggle is the most visible at the moment.

Planes crash into World Trade Center, creating horrifying scene; no word on Tuesday, September 11, 2001
)2001 Associated Press
URL:  (09-11) 06:39 PDT (AP) --
AP National Writer
NEW YORK (AP) -- Two planes crashed into the upper floors of both World Trade Center towers minutes apart Tuesday in what the President Bush said was an apparent terrorist attack, blasting fiery, gaping holes in the 110-story buildings. There was no immediate word on deaths or injuries.
The president ordered a full-scale investigation to "hunt down the folks who committed this act"
The twin disasters which happened shortly before 9 a.m. and then right around 9 a.m.
In Washington, officials said the FBI was investigating reports of a plane hijacking before the crashes.
Heavy black smoke billowed into the sky above the gaping holes in the side of the 110-story twin towers, one of New York City's most famous landmarks, and debris rained down upon the street, one of the city's busiest work areas. When the second plane hit, a fireball of flame and smoke erupted, leaving a huge hole in the glass and steel tower.
"Today we've had a national tragedy," Bush said. He called it "an apparent terrorist attack."
Ira Furber, former NTSB spokesman, discounted likelihood of accident.
"I don't think this is an accident," he said on CNN. "You've got incredibly good visibility. No pilot is going to be relying on navigational equipment."
"It's just not possible in the daytime," he added. "A second occurrence is just beyond belief."
The towers were struck by terrorist bombers in February 1993, killing six people and injuring more than 1,000 others.
All New York City-area airports were shut down, and several subway lines were immediately shut down. Trading on Wall Street was suspended.
"The plane was coming in low and ... it looked like it hit at a slight angle," said Sean Murtagh, a CNN vice president, the network reported.
"I was watching TV and heard a sonic boom," Jeanne Yurman told CNN. "The side of the World Trade Center exploded. Debris is falling like leaflets. I hear ambulances. The northern tower seems to be on fire."
Thousands of pieces of what appeared to be office paper came drifting over Brooklyn, about three miles from the tower.
A senior government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the agency is pursuing reports that one or both of the planes were hijacked and that the crashes may have been the result of a suicide mission.
The source stressed that the reports are preliminary and officials do not know the cause of the crashes.
"It certainly doesn't look like an accident," said a second government official, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
In 1945, an Army Air Corps B-25, a twin-engine bomber, crashed into the 79th floor of the Empire State Building in dense fog.
In Sarasota, Fla., Bush was reading to children in a classroom at 9:05 a.m. when his chief of staff, Andrew Card, whispered into his ear. The president briefly turned somber before he resumed reading. He addressed the tragedy about a half-hour later.

The mailbot deleted the pictures.
That's not a nationwide thing or an all-phone-companies thing -
most NYC-based numbers would be hard to reach,
and maybe some long distance carrier's database is in NYC,
but it's unlikely they'd have only a single database.
I'd heard there was a crash in Camp David - this is first I'd heard of this.
He was making speeches from an AFB in Louisiana.
The logical places to go would be Camp David (guess not...)
or Andrews AFB or the Fort Ritchie, MD emergency site.
The less logical place to go is back to the White House -
it's a bit riskier, but would make good PR.

@_subject: The 4th Airliner Shot Down? 
The airliner that crashed in Pennsylvania was the one where one of
the passengers called his family on the cellphone and said (after other things)
they were going to try to rush the hijackers.
I'm not sure if that's the same plane where the cellphone caller
said the hijackers claimed to have a bomb or not,
but even if they *said* that it doesn't mean they really had one.
So it could have been a bomb, or it could have been a fight in the cockpit.
Some of the pilots may also have had family killed by Israel
or by US bombings in Iraq or the ten years of blockade --
today's (pre-bombing) Marin County CA paper had an opinion-page column
by somebody who just had permits rejected by the US export bureaucrats
for water chlorination systems they were trying to export to Iraq;
they smuggled them there anyway because unsafe water is *still* the
leading cause of death in Iraq.  Soldiers who are really angry
are sometimes willing to do suicidal attacks.

It's an excellent ruling, even though it is only allowing the

happened in Mexico and not the time he spent in jail in the US

Todos Santos may have been, but it had the advantage of being fictional,
as did Gibson's nanotech-Nippon buildings that grew at night when
nobody was looking.  Unless we can get the economic systems
to support the number of people who work in a building like that,
including commuting costs from residential areas,
to balance out the benefits of working near each other,
the non-replacement of the building will be just evolution in action.
Donald Trump is a capitalist - if building his proposed
kilometer-high New Trump Tower would have made sense without
the subsidies he's been so good at talking New York into giving him,
it'd probably be built by now.  It's not.
Rebuilding it doesn't make sense, though I did enjoy the picture
that's been floating around the net of the replacement building,
four towers shaped like a hand with the middle finger extended. :-)
If it weren't for the near-infinite value of land in Manhattan,
I'd say it would be better to build your basic eternal-flame monument there.
Agreed - the Empire State building and Chrysler Building are cool,
but the WTC was ugly, though the view from the restaurant was impressive.
(...and the John Hancock tower in Boston at least had the entertainment value
of guessing where the next glass window was going to fall off...)
And the Parthenon lasted over 2000 years - it didn't turn into a ruin
until the Turks blew up the ammunition storage there in the ~1850s.
The Internet makes it possible for anybody to work from anywhere they want.
Of course, that's why everybody moved to the San Francisco Bay Area
to be near the action :-)

@_subject: AP - Was Crypto-anonymity greases HUMINT intelligence flows 
AP was designed to implement several objectives:
- Let the customer or customers for the service remain anonymous
- Let the service provider get paid without getting caught,
which includes remaining anonymous to the customers,
where the primary threat is governments tracking the payment.
- Let the potential target know the depth of public opinion about
his/her actions, encouraging a change of behavior to prevent the
bids from becoming sufficiently high.
In this case, the Feds didn't feel the need to remain anonymous
when they put out their "Bring Me The Head Of Osama bin Laden" contract,
nor did the dot-com millionaire who recently bid $10M.
And if bin Laden hadn't figured out that the Feds disliked him
by the time they fired 75 cruise missiles with his name on them
after they accused him of the embassy bombings, sticking his name
up on a computer bulletin board system won't change that much.
While anonymous digital cash, if it existed, would make payment quieter,
that's not the real problem for the stoolie who fingers bin Laden.
The traditional "here's the number for a secret Swiss Bank Account"
should do fine, or handing over the Magic American Express Card.
The problem is that anybody close enough to bin Laden who suddenly
started spending lots of cash after the Feds moved in would
suddenly be a very obvious candidate for community disapproval;
that's one mujahid who's better off leaving a revenge/suicide note
followed by CNN reporting that a small explosives-laden Cessna
was shot down over the Potomac.
Yeah - unlike Salmon Rushdie, there may be fewer people who want him killed,
but they'd be much more serious about it.
Include a public key with the anonymous tip,
and have the Feds encrypt the Swiss Bank Account Number with it.
Or at least have the money-delivery instructions signed with that key.

If you're fancy about it, and don't mind a little trademark violation,
you could even print up a nice card that *looks* like
it's from the reputable long distance company the target uses :-)
A couple of years ago, when fast-buck artists used pyramid scams
that actually involved bothering your friends in person
instead of just spamming the internet, you might have even
been able to find a calling-card business that made this easy,
because they had some business model involving advertising cards
to the people your suckers\\\\\\customers called.
The important thing is to find something that's
account-based rather than one-shot cash-up-front -
it's a lot cheaper for those companies not to need a billing system,
but sometimes the stickiness of repeat customers justifies it,
though they're more likely to send mail that doesn't list calls.
Most of those companies are gone now, but you could check the cards
for sale in your local convenience store or ethnic grocery
or lottery-tickets-and-liquor store and see if any of them
will do what you need.  Ethnic groceries are especially likely to work,
because telephone calls to third-world telcos are the most likely
to still have prices high enough to make workarounds profitable,
while US and UK prices are low enough that far fewer people care.

Hear, hear!   That's particularly true for Feds pursuing terrorists -
there are enough Federal judges, either regular or FISA Star Chamber types,
that any cop who's doing something other than hot pursuit can get a warrant
any time they need to - and if Congress doesn't think this is the case,
the solution is not to drop the Constitution, it's to hire some extra judges
to work nights, and give them an internet connection to keep busy on slow What's much harder to do in real time is give the judge enough real evidence
for more than a rubber-stamp review.  Even that's better than nothing,
because it keeps the cops maintaining some pretense of respect for law
and creates accounting records of the warrants, but it's likely to be
pretty shoddy.

Many years ago, when I was a tool of the military-industrial complex,
I was part of a project that bid on replacing the communications
infrastructure of part of the Pentagon, which included bidding on rewiring it.
Yow, what an ugly and impossible job that was!
The prime contractor we were working for didn't win the job,
so fortunately we didn't have to deal with it.
Just because the Pentagon is not compliant with fire safety codes
doesn't mean there isn't a lot of asbestos all over the place -
running new wiring in the ceiling would have been very risky,
even if anybody *had* a complete picture of what's in the ceilings there.
Bidding on the job was, IIRC, entirely unclassified,
so there are large parts of the blueprints that don't
even identify what agencies control some of the blacked-out spaces.
George Bush doesn't have all the right clearances to all the
different projects that have stuck stuff in there,
and some of the wires were installed by people who are dead now
and will never be able to tell what they were for or whether
they're still in use, but you can't just fish new stuff in
next to them, because a lot of the wiring troughs and plenum spaces
aren't sufficiently clear.  It's kind of like an old-fashioned
computer room or telco building where you can't quite get the
floor tiles to stay down, because there's so much excess wire
that there's no room for the moat monsters
these aren't the skeletons you're looking for
There aren't a lot of wiring / electrician companies that have
general enough permissions to work on the place.
This was 1990-1991, around the beginning of the Desert Scam war,
because one thing everybody insisted on was that,
while the wiring plans couldn't overly violate TEMPEST by being antennas,
they *did* need to get CNN piped in to everybody.
I was commuting past many of the places you hear about on the
NYC traffic radio reports; stopping by the UN to do anti-war protests
on the way back from bidding on rewiring the Pentagon was
heavily into cognitive dissonance territory, and one of the things
that helped push me into finding honest work...

Back when Osama bin Laden was accused of the African US embassy bombings,
the Clinton administration decided they had to Do Something Decisive,
so they fired off about 75 cruise missiles at
"Osama's Chemical/Biological Warfare Factory" (somebody's legitimate
pharmaceutical plant in Sudan) and another place he was rumored to hang out.
It's not clear whether this sets him up for Double Jeopardy protection
if anybody takes the $5M reward and rats on him, because they didn't
bother with the formalities of a trial, just a declaration of guilt
followed by punishment, but it was Constitutionally pretty dodgy.
And if it's not strictly targeting innocents while knowing they're innocent,
failing to find out the facts before attacking people with missiles
is sufficiently negligent that I'd count it in the same category.
I think the US did pay off the factory owner after finding out
that they'd screwed up.  I don't know how many people got killed
in the process, though.

Common-carrier status is a complex deal, including some protection in return for lots of regulation.
But it's not the only choice - the ECPA and DMCA and even the otherwise-evil Communications Decency Act
provided some protection for network operators under various conditions.
Of course, just because the ECPA or CDA gave you some protections,

WASHINGTON Â U.S. Rep. John Cooksey, R-Monroe,
         told a network of Louisiana radio stations Monday that
         someone "wearing a diaper on his head" should expect to be
         interrogated in the investigation of terrorist attacks on the
         Pentagon and New York City.
and he jingoes on from there.  Cooksey doesn't say whether he was
including the KKK in the category of people with diapers on their head,
or what to do about politicians who need to change their own diapers.
He does acknowledge that some turban-wearers are Americans,
and some aren't Muslims or Arabs, but he still thinks they
need to be pulled over, because bin Laden and many of his followers
wear turbans.
Bin Laden has also been rumored to wear pants.
Cooksey won't be running for House again in 2002 - he's planning
to run for Senate instead.  I hope the Democrat's better,
though this is the part of the country that put out
"vote for the crook" bumper stickers when the crook's
opponent was (ostensibly ex-) Klansman David Duke.

It is bait and switch, but the argument is that if the

they can go see if he's got any co-conspirators and arrest them,
so the risk of getting caught is a deterrent to wouldbe co-conspirators
in future wouldbe crimes, and meanwhile it lets the cops look good
by catching the guys who helped do it.

The 419 scam is a bit different from most "Can you help me get my money"

In this one, the cons are pretty much admitting that the money

So the mark isn't an innocent dupe, but a guilty dupe,

@_subject: Smallpox? 
There are two large terrorist organizations that have smallpox supplies -
the US* and Russian military biological warfare groups -
and there are occasional rumors that other terrorists may also have them.
Each of the big terrorist groups claims that they need to keep the stuff
so that they can prepare vaccines in case the other side uses their stash for CBW,
and that they can't do a mutual disarmament because they can't trust each other
not to keep some hidden stash - plus the possibility that some other
terrorist group may have some, or that there may be some in the wild
that could reappear some day and we'd then be defenseless.
This is especially bogus for smallpox, because (as Jenner discovered),
cowpox is usable as a vaccine against smallpox, so keeping that
should be good enough, though the smallpox-based vaccines are more convenient.
There's a certain amount of counter-argument that says that the
other terrorists might have done some genetic engineering to create
a mutant smallpox that isn't bothered by cowpox immunity,
and therefore they need to keep the Genuine Bad Stuff around.

to run the repository, but it's the basically the military's control here.]

One problem you'll find is that even if you mutt-sign your messages,
the people on the lne.com list are going to receive them de-mimed,
so you can't depend on the mutt-mime-sigs getting through.
I don't mind MIME attachments, much, though it's much nicer to be

double-click on the things and feed them to PGP just to read them;
the versions of Mutt that didn't have this problem were almost

I use Eudora, which AFAIK doesn't lie about attachment filenames,

 Traffic System Causes Privacy Outcry
By KAREN GAUDETTE
Associated Press Writer
August 8, 2002, 6:36 PM EDT
OAKLAND, Calif. -- In about a month, traffic sensors being installed along
San Francisco Bay area highways will be able to track a quarter million
drivers along their commutes.
Proponents say the $37 million enhancement to the region's electronic toll
system will be a boon to commuters, providing motorists real-time
information about some of the nation's worst road congestion via cell phone,
radio or Internet.
Traffic planners will be able to gather crucial data on problem areas.
But despite government assurances, the new program is also raising fears
that drivers' privacy will be invaded.
Similar to systems in Houston and the New York region, the Bay area's
FasTrak program already eases waits at toll plazas by enabling motorists to
pay with electronic devices velcroed to the windshields of vehicles.
Now, radio-based sensors mounted on highway signs every few miles will
augment the devices' usefulness.
To the dismay of some FasTrak users, monitoring is not optional. The only
way to avoid triggering the sensors throughout nine Bay Area counties is to
stash the transponder in its accompanying Mylar bag.
Project leaders at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission say they're
not interested in the movements of individual drivers, and have gone to
great lengths to protect privacy, including encrypting the serial number of
each transponder as its location is transmitted.
Authorities promise to keep this data separate from the identities of
FasTrak users and other information needed to make automatic monthly
deductions from their bank or credit card accounts.
"We're not tracking or trying to follow any individual car, just the overall
traffic flow," TravInfo project manager Michael Berman said.
But some drivers say having a more detailed traffic report isn't worth the
sense that someone's watching.
"I personally am a little creeped out by it," said interior designer Heidi
Hirvonen-White, who crosses the Golden Gate Bridge commuting between Tiburon
and San Francisco. "In today's society it seems like any sort of code or
whatnot can be broken."
Those in the automotive telematics industry say the Bay Area's "TravInfo"
project is only the latest example of the growing phenomenon of remote
Many rental fleets and trucking companies already use satellite positioning
systems to track cars and cargo. Companies promote similar products for
keeping tabs on kids, Alzheimer's patients or cheating spouses.
Washington is also promoting locator technology. By October, the Federal
Communications Commission wants cell phones equipped with locator technology
to help emergency responders find callers.
That requirement will also enable authorities to track users, even
calculating road speeds, said Ray Grefe, vice president of business
development for telematics software company Televoke.
"I think there are going to be some nasty court battles that come out of all
of this stuff," Grefe said.
Transponder data has already been used in court.
In 1997, E-ZPass records helped show what kidnappers did to New Jersey
restaurant millionaire Nelson Gross, whose BMW crossed the George Washington
Bridge into Manhattan, where his beaten corpse was found.
Another case involved a Connecticut rental car company that charged
customers $150 each time a GPS receiver showed they were speeding. The
company has since stopped the practice.
Berman emphasized that the Bay Area system won't be used to track kidnappers
or car thieves who happen to have FasTrak in their cars, let alone
The MTC -- along with its partners, the California Highway Patrol and the
state transportation department -- has received no requests from law
enforcement to tweak the system so drivers could be pursued, Berman said,
adding, "I think if they were to request it, we would say no. That's not our
But privacy advocates say that once the sensors are in place, there's
nothing to prevent such a change. New laws imposed after Sept. 11 make it
much easier for police to obtain such information.
"Yes, they're building in limitations on the data use, but there's nothing
to prevent them from changing the policies in the future," said Beth Givens,
director of the San Diego-based Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.
Each of the California system's sensors has two antennas. One continually
sends out a radio pulse that "wakes up" when it hits a passing FasTrak
transponder. The other antenna notes the transponder's serial number, and
transmits it, using encryption, via cellular modem to the MTC's Travel
Information Center in Oakland.
Transponders beep as cars pass through toll plazas, but remain silent when
they pass the sensors.
All record of serials numbers stored in electronic files will be destroyed
daily, leaving only general averages and patterns for later study, Berman
In Texas, 1.5 million commuters use a similar traffic information service,
said Artee Jones, spokesman for Houston TranStar, which incorporates similar
privacy measures.
While some FasTrak users remain troubled, few said they'd give up the
shorter toll booth lines or discounts to avoid participating.
Michael Pieri of Richmond said he has nothing to hide, but he'll still stash
the transponder away between tolls.
"That's fine if you volunteer for that," he said. "But involuntarily, I
don't think it's a good thing at all."

this seems like simple libel to me.  At least for the Usual Suspects

investigation of a crime or other legitimate police function that's
protected by laws protecting government officials doing their official jobs.

Most state governments also give you a breakdown on the things that
they spend the money on (with usually some weasel-words to avoid
indicating that it's proceeds from scamming suckers.
Usually the establishment of the lottery was justified to the voters
by saying they'd spend the money on schools and old people;
usually the actual spending is mostly for prisons (to keep
druggies and gamblers in) and other disreputable things.
The Mafia, by contrast, explains how they spend their money
by saying "Duh, we're the Mafia, whaddyatink?"
Also, the Mafia doesn't hypocritically claim that they're
forbidding other people to run lotteries because they're immoral;
they may claim that they're doing it because "this is *my* territory".
Of course, both of them let the Catholic Church and Fire Departments
run bingo games.  And at least back when I lived in New Jersey,
we didn't get a state lottery until the Mafia agreed that
it was ok to run it if the payoff was a lot worse than their Daily Number.
(Mafia payoff was 60%; State was usually 50%.)

I'd expect the ILO to be socialist - they are a big union after all -
but I wouldn't expect them to be totalitarians.
Sure, it's a way to create a harder-to-avoid union card,
and a way for their biggest customers to be forced to hire their people
by using government pressure to enforce it.  It's also a surveillance
mechanism to let management keep track of sailors they dislike,
prevent politically incorrect people from getting jobs as sailors,
give governments additional control over sailors in port,
private sailors, and refugees who can't afford to travel on airplanes,
and gives large governments an increased excuse to interfere with
high-seas traffic between other countries under the pretense of
checking whether all the sailors are documented.
 From a technology perspective, the interesting paragraph is
         The plans have drawn criticism from seafarer's groups
         concerned that port authorities may insert information in
         so-called ``smart'' identification
         documents without the cardholder's knowledge.
Sure, smart cards with non-user-viewable data can easily have
extra data in them saying the user is a "Communist" or "union organizer"
or did scab labor or is a Muslim or a Jew or a Rastafarian.
And it's easy for port authorities to send copies of sailors' photos
to their local police in case they're wandering around town.
But with the Internet reaching everywhere, either by wire or satellite,
the information doesn't need to be hidden in the card.
The card says that you're "Sailor  so they can look you up
on any website they want - not just the ILO's "paid their union dues"
database, and Interpol's "Never been caught smoking dope" database,
and the shipping companies' "Not a union troublemaker" database",
and the "originally from _this_ country even though they're now American" and Blacknet's databases on "gets in Bar Fights" and "scab laborers".

One of the usual arguments for key escrow was always
"what if your employee dies and you can't get his data?"
Secret Sharing techniques are of course a better approach,
or at least storing sealed envelopes in company safes
as a much better approach than pre-broken crypto.
There've been a couple of stories in the press recently
where weak passwords also solved the problem.
One was a radio piece, I think NPR, about one of the companies
in the World Trade Center who'd lost their computer administrators
in the 9/11 attacks.  The remaining employees got together and
started telling stories about their co-workers - their interests,
their family members, where they'd gone on vacation, their dogs' names, etc.
They got most of the passwords.  (It was a piece about modern management
styles, and how in older hierarchical companies there'd be fewer
people who knew the new employees well enough to do that.)
The other was about the loss of the database of the personal
library collection of one of the main linguists studying one of
the two main Norwegian dialects.   It's now been cracked...

Sigh.  Back when the US Feds were still trying to push Key Escrow on the
National Information Infrastructure, I started research for an April 1 RFC
for the National Information Infrastructure Data Entry Escrow Protocol, and proposed NIIDEEP Information Network Protocol Implementation Government
Standard, NIIDEEPINPIGS.  (Didn't get it finished by April 1 :-)
Because after all, there's no sense escrowing our crypto keys if you
don't also escrow the cyphertext - some of Eric Hughes's talks on
Message Escrow and Data Retention Policies were excellent explanations
of why those was the critical issues.
If the US Feds and Eurocrats would like us to provide them with all of our the existing internet would need to double in size to transport all of it
to the appropriate government data storage facilities, or more than double
if separate copies need to be provided to multiple national governments,
or much more if local governments such as city trade commissions need copies.
Since this is clearly unrealistic, even with the demise of the E-Bone,
transmission will require the use of off-line data transmission technology.
Waiting for approval of new government standards would take too long, and
lose access to valuable data because of the resulting delay of several years,
but there are several existing standards for data storage that can be applies.
My long-lost research had the FIPS (US Federal Information Processing references for several of them, but the current environment requires
the corresponding European standards as well, and I'll need assistance.
But there's also been progress!  RFC 1149 (Avian Carriers) has been though scalable implementation and dual-source requirements may require
genetic reconstruction of the Passenger Pigeon to supplement current carrier species.
Modular methods uses standard data storage formats and separate transmission.
Standards widely supported in the US include Hollerith cards,
1600 bpi 9-track tapes with EBCDIC character sets and fixed block sizes and and ASCII-format punch tape (with country-specific standards for recycled paper content.)
8-inch floppy disks have also been widely used, and support both
CP/M and RT11 file system formats.
Are there corresponding European standards for data storage?
Transmission methods for data storage media include International
Postal Union standards for link layer and addressing formats and pricing,
though I'm not directly familiar with standards for shipping containers
where data encapsulation is required.

A century ago, music was largely an individual, family, or
social activity, with most paid performers receiving payments for
live performances in front of audiences, though sound recordings and
player pianos were starting to emerge and commercial sheet music
had been around since about the 1840s.  The transformation of their work
from performing live into preparing packaged goods for mass distribution
is a relatively recent thing, and much of it dates from about the 50s

@_subject: Closed source more secure than open source 
I don't know where *you* develop software, but anywhere I've been or seen
that had QA engineers signing off on non-functional products would
either lead to serious re-education for the engineers or
an internal understanding that the company values ship dates above
capabilities (not that that's unknown in the industry,
and admittedly closed-source development shops are more likely
to have business models that emphasize shipping, but Darwin fixes them.)
One of the purposes of having QA people work without source
is so that they're actually testing documented functions of the product,
rather than testing what the code looks like it can do successfully.
Except for those products that are code designed to be integrated
into other programs, where actual code matters, that modularity is critical.
You test the interfaces, not the innards.  It's still an infinite problem,
but it's much less infinite, and lets you hit what you need.
If the interfaces don't work, you're supposed to figure that out,
though sometimes late-alpha code is known to be missing major pieces --
you usually work around this by writing lots of test drivers.
You're also supposed to find out if there are missing pieces that
somehow escaped the design phase.
White-box testing lets you go beyond that to find subtle nasty bugs
that escaped unit testing and developer code reviews,
and have a better view into holes in the system
that a malicious attacker can break.  It's important for security,
because there are often things you don't find during black-box testing.
A much more serious problem is coders and testers believing that the
design documentation they're working from, if any, reflects what the
system is supposed to do and what it's supposed to not do.
In commercial code with internal testers, you're not supposed to need this.
Obviously, for community-tested code, duplication in code coverage is common,
and one challenge for the open-source business is finding ways to
improve test coverage in volunteer testing, by adding some kind of

@_subject: Another restriction on technology - cell and cordless  
The laws that established the FCC were just laws -
they're not Supreme Court decisions that are hard to change.
Congress made them, Congress can unmake them, change them, or
replace them with totally different laws.
They're not engraved in stone requiring Constitutional Amendments to fix -
they're written in sand, and if the wind blows the other direction
and 51% of Congress wants to change them, they're changed.
The FCC has limitations on how much *they* can change basic structures
set out in the laws, but the laws give them a lot of flexibility too.
The real stability is that the current regulatory structure
gives big economic advantages to the entrenched players,
so they're going to resist changes that stop favoring them,
while the regulatory bureaucracy gets a lot of power and influence
from giving favors to the big players, so they don't rock the boat either.
Nobody's had a good enough case, and the lawmakers have tended to go along
with the FCC on things like laws against monitoring unencrypted cellphones
(the alternative would have been removing laws and policies that
banned or discouraged encrypted cellphones,
which they didn't want back then, because Commies might use them
or the FBI might have trouble wiretapping cell phones without
getting proper warrants.)
It was a terrible policy and we've suffered from it ever since*.
It's led to the current media oligopolies, with a narrow spectrum
of opinions from the pro-establishment pro-government corporatists,
pernicious policies of political correctness that, while not as
strict today as they were in the 50s, still strongly limit the
kinds of content you see on TV - and all of these were the kinds of things
that the policies were *intended* to do.
Unintended effects of the policies include decades of
restricted access to telecommunications in rural areas
(because the FCC's radio monopolies prevented development
of economical scalable radio-based telephony, which fit just fine with the
FCC's support for wireline telco monopolies.)  This also delayed
practical mobile technology for a decade or two.
Look at the explosion of interest in 802.11 wireless as an example
of what happens when you've got even a small space available
to use by the public rather than the bureaucracy and its friends.
Dave Farber and Gerry Faulhaber have a bunch of papers and a presentation at
There's further discussion at
and a long nice article from the Seattle Times at
The 1934 policies took spectrum that was a commons available to everyone,
seized and nationalized it in the name of "the public", and
turned it into a tool for political patronage.   Competition for use
of the spectrum worked fairly well before that, and it wasn't just
because of the primitive state of technology - Italy did without
radio spectrum licensing through most of the 80s and 90s
(they had an official bureaucracy, but it's greed was exceeded by
its incompetence, so the radio broadcasters started to just ignore it;
this lasted until right-wing media magnate Berlisconi became prime minister.)
Farber and Faulhaber point out that the regulatory environment is
incompetent, inefficient, and unnecessary, and make a good comparison
to the old Soviet GOSPLAN economic central planners;
they argue as engineers as well as economists.
While I disagree with their recommendations (big-bang auction of the
whole spectrum, and let the government bid on some space for unlicensed it couldn't be much worse than the current system.

It's been almost ten years since I was in the Keyport NJ library,

If you wanted to see who'd checked out a given book
that was on the shelf, you'd look at the card in the back and
see the library card numbers of the people who'd checked it out,
and they might have had dates as well.  To find which 3 or 4 digit number
corresponded to which person, it'd depend on whether they took their
library card home with them the last time they'd returned books
or left it at the library (mine might still be there?),
and if they currently had books out, it was definitely at the library.
If they took the card home, they had privacy, though the librarian
often did know her regular customers by sight.
They might have computer records for books they got on interlibrary loan,
but that'd be about it - no sense in spending money on computerizing
when old-fashioned card catalogs worked well enough for the speed at
which they acquired books.
On the other hand, any place that does computerize finds it almost as easy
to keep records permanently as not, and it's certainly easier to centralize
records and make them searchable.

You're not making appropriate technology choices,
so your costs are off by a factor of 5-10.
IDE is just fine, especially in RAID configurations,
because if you're making a scalable system, you can use as many spindles
as you need, and you don't need to run fully mirrored systems - RAID5 is fine.
Almost any technology you get can run 5MB/sec, which is T3 speeds,
so that RAID5 system can keep up with an OC3 with no problem.
Disk drive prices here in the US are about $1/GB for IDE.
The problem is that's about 200 seconds of T3 time, so your 5 100GB drives
will last about a day before you take them offline for tape backup.
The real constraints become how fast you can copy to tape,
i.e. how many tape drives you need to buy, and what fraction of data you keep.
If it's 1%, you can afford it - adding $5/day = $150/month per T3 is just Keeping 10% of the bits - $50/day = $1500/month/T3 -
is a non-trivial fraction of your cost, so you have to go for tape.
Fibre channels are useful for cutting-edge databases on mainframes,
and have the entertaining property that they can go 10-20km,
so you've got more choices for offsite backup, but GigE is fine here.

Perhaps I've missed some really critical things the time or two
that I've read "The Transparent Society", or projected too much
liberarian hype into my reading, but to me the big points were
- Moore's Law, etc., will make networked cameras so appallingly cheap
         that that they'll be pretty much universal.  It'll do it to other
         information technologies as well, but the public has an easier time
         understanding what a camera means than a database, so that's the
         one to focus on when you're writing popular science.
- Usual digressions into what Moore's Law and cheap and universal mean,
         and some implications about the realism of expecations of privacy
         that need to be said slowly for people who haven't spent years
         talking about geodesic economies and therefore don't get it (:-)
- Lots of people will be watching you on cameras, either because they
         feel like it, or because they're watching something else
         and it's too much trouble to not watch you at the same time.
         And you'll be watching lots of people or things, for similar reasons,
         and realistically there's not much that'll stop it.
- The government will be watching you, like it or not.
         Brin spends a while discussing the issue of whether we should
         try to stop them from doing so through legislation,
         but basically views it as a lost cause for economic reasons,
         and all the related reasons of power, convenience, control, etc.
         (I don't remember how much time he spent on the "even if they ban
         government from watching you most of the time, they'll always
         give themselves exemptions even if they bother following the rules,
         so just get used to it" issue, but it was there.  Video's too cheap.)
- We might be watching the government, or we might not,
         and the government are the only major group that can easily
         make it hard to watch them, because they can throw you in jail
         if you get in their face, and they've got enough control over
         their actions to make it difficult to watch them.
         THIS IS WHERE WE NEED TO FOCUS AS CITIZENS, because if you don't
         force them to do their work in the sunshine, they won't,
         and because getting them not to watch you is a lost cause.
- Cypherpunks technologies are mostly a lost cause, because
         Bad Guys (mainly the government) will use them to do their bad          whereas they can put cameras in your ceiling to watch you type your passwords,
         hide bugs under your bed (next to the Communists) to listen to the
         conversations you're having on your EnCryptoPhone, etc.
         Making sure the government is maximally watchable is more important,
         and if you say you're allowed to hide your actions,
         they'll make sure they're allowed to hide theirs,
         and they're better at this organized coercion thing than you are.
Perhaps I'm putting words in Brin's mouth, especially about the latter,

Mules are trying to transmit atoms, not bits, and if you're

Some of the memory flake formats are really pretty thin and hidable,

@_subject: Real-world steganography 
Traditional digital telephone signalling uses a "robbed-bit" method that
steals the low-order bit from every sixth voice sample to carry information
like whether the line is busy or idle or wants to set up a connection.
(That's why you only get 56kbps and not 64kbps in some US formats,
since it doesn't want to keep track of which low bits got robbed.)
In a sense both of these are steganography, because they're trying to
hide the data channel from the audio listener by being low level noise
in ways that equipment that isn't looking for it won't notice.
That's not really much different from encoding Secret Data in the LSB
of uncompressed graphics or audio - it's about the second-crudest
form of the stuff, and if you think there are Attackers trying to
decide if you're using stego, you need more sophisticated stego -
at minimum, encoding the stegotext so it looks like random noise,
or encoding the stegotext with statistics resembling the
real noise patterns, or whatever.  The definition of "hidden writing"
doesn't specify how hard you tried to hide it or how hard the
Attacker is looking - you need to Bring Your Own Threat Model.
Since I don't speak Audiophile Engineering / Human perceptual modelspeak,
which the paper was written in, I wasn't able to figure out where the
HDCD stuff hides the extra bits.  Are they really there (in the CDROM's
error-correction bits or something)?  It sounded like they were either
saying that they make part-time use of the one LSB bit to somehow encode
the LSB and 4 more bits, which sounded really unlikely given that there
weren't any equations there about the compression models, or else that they
had some perceptual model and were using that to make a better choice of LSB
than a simple 50% cut-off of the A-to-D converter (more absolute distortion,
but better-sounding distortion.)  Or did I miss the implications of the
reference to oversampling and the real difference is that HDCD disks
really have more pixels on the disk with only the LSB different,
so a conventional reader reads it fine but needs the ECC to get the LSB?
A separate question is - "so is there some internet-accessible list of
disks using HDCD, or do I just have to look at the labels for a logo?"

@_subject: What email encryption is actually in use? 
I'm running Win2000 in "You're Not The Administrator" mode.
Since somebody else is root and I'm not, the fact that
my network admins could eavesdrop on my link traffic
isn't a big deal, especially when they set up my PC's software.
And if I do pretend to trust my machine against some insiders,
I can use SSH, SSL, and PGP to reduce risks from others...
Also, STARTTLS can reduce eavesdropping at Alice's ABC.COM.
If your organization is an ISP, the risks are letting them
handle your email at all (especially with currently proposed
mandatory eavesdropping laws), and STARTTLS provides a
mechanism for direct delivery that isn't as likely to be blocked
by anti-spamming restrictions on port 25.
Now to get some email *clients* using it.
On the other hand, if your recipient is at a big corporation,
they're highly likely to be using a big shared MS Exchange server,
or some standards-based equivalent, so the game's over on that end
before you even start.  Take the STARTTLS and run with it...
Defense in depth is important for real security.
STARTTLS can be a link-encryption solution,
but it can also be part of a layered solution,
and if you don't bother with end-to-end,
it's a really good start, and isolates your risks.
It also offers you some possibility of doing certificate management
to reduce the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks from
outside your organization, and does reduce some traffic analysis.
If your goal is to encrypt 20% of the net by Christmas,
STARTTLS will get a lot closer to that than a perfect system.
Similarly, IPSEC using the shared key "open secret"
would have been a much-faster-deployed form of opportunistic
encryption than the FreeSWAN project's more complex form
that wants some control over DNS that most users don't have.
In the absence of a real Public Key Infrastructure,
neither is totally man-in-the-middle-proof,
so if the Feds are targeting *you* it's clearly not enough,
but reducing mass-quantity fishing expeditions increases
our security and reduces the Echelon potential -
especially if 90% of the encrypted material is
routine corporate email, mailing lists, Usenet drivel, etc.
You can protect most of the path if your firewalls don't interfere,
and more if your recipients' don't.

its real interest is use in criminal transactions.

flexibility, speed, lower costs than official banks,
arbitrage around official exchange rates,

The following web page is about recent projects at the

designed to monitor large numbers of conversations for drug activity.
The accompanying artwork has a large and small version of a
wiretapper logo, which should be possible to abuse for something :-)
Google cache: Wiretapper Logo: The Information Directorate's Multisensor Exploitation Branch and Research Associates for Defense Conversion (RADC) jointly developed, tested, and demonstrated an experimental model capability that automatically extracts information from telephone background sounds and conversational speech to identify drug networks and the participants. The work, sponsored by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), addresses the problem of monitoring large numbers of telephone conversations for drug activity, while protecting the privacy of citizens in accordance with wiretap laws.
The capability called Automated Title Three Audio Correlation (ATTAC) makes it possible to automatically segment and flag drug- related activity and identify its participants without understanding the message content of the conversation. A background sound recognizer technology identifies sounds, such as dial tone, number dialed, ringing, and other sounds, while a Vector Quantization speaker-recognition technology identifies the persons involved in the conversations.
The DEA and RADC collected a database of conversations through 74 individuals who made over 1300 calls from cellular phones, and office phones, and who used message machines. The results in identifying the participants in conversational speech varied widely. DEA and RADC technicians obtained good results (90%) when individuals used the same phones; however, when the same individuals used different phones, the performance could drop to as low as 55%.
The directorate is conducting research work to improve recognition across multiple phone types. Although the directorate developed ATTAC for DEA use, the technology developed advances the state-of-the-art in speaker segmentation and in information extraction for the Air Force intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission.

Somebody backdoored the source code for Sendmail on the official server.
So if you recompile from scratch, your sendmail is 0wned.
Another reason not to run mail systems as root....
By  Robert Lemos
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
October 8, 2002, 5:57 PM PT
Some copies of a popular mail-server program are implanted with a back door that could allow access to Internet attackers, security experts warned Tuesday.
A Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) Coordination Center advisory said that illicit code added to the Sendmail package creates a back door when the program is compiled from its source code. Such a compromised program--called a Trojan horse by security experts--can leave networks exposed to attack and administrators unaware of the vulnerabilities.
The source code files of Sendmail 8.12.6 were apparently modified as far back as Sept. 28, according to the advisory. The Sendmail Consortium   removed file transfer protocol (FTP) access to the server on Sunday. A safe version of the file can still be downloaded via the Web.
"If you download the Sendmail distribution you MUST verify the PGP signature," stated the consortium on its site. "Do NOT use Sendmail without verifying the integrity of the source code."
The added code links to a specific server on the Internet, said CERT in its advisory. The security group also recommends that anyone who downloads Sendmail verify the file's integrity.
Because only the act of compiling the file activates the hostile program code, restarting the Sendmail server seems to deactivate the backdoor

OTPs won't help a bit for that problem.
They're fine for transmitting new data if you've already sent a pad,
but they're useless for storing secrets, because you can only decrypt
something if you've got the pad around, and you have to burn the pad after Storing the encrypted secret message on your regular computers
while keeping the pad locked up in the safe is unlikely to be

The speed of quantum computing depends on the algorithm -
it's generally believed that for some problems, like factoring,
you can hypothetically get a hypothetically-precise-enough
quantum computer to resolve in polynomial time instead of exponential,
subject to a variety of caveats I don't pretend to understand,
but for many other problems they're only cutting the
effective number of bits in half (which is still exponentially
faster than brute-force, but not *enough* exponentially faster),
and for other problems they may not be a match at all.
So Peter Trei's assertion that it's really only a big impact
on asymmetric cryptosystems, and a much smaller impact on symmetric,
is one layer deeper description than yours,
and it's something that does still leave us with practical ways
to use cryptography that don't include briefcases and handcuffs.

How do you prevent other applications from reading the file off your

That's one of the big differences between a computerized OTP
and a Dead Trees (or Dead Silkworms) OTP, which is much harder for
someone or something else to read without you noticing.
Since you say that "Used bits are securely deleted",
does your application distinguish between using the pad to encrypt
and using the pad to decrypt (which are basically the same thing,
except for destroying the key bits the second time)?
Landon Noll has done some interesting work taking a cheap PC camera
and keeping it in the dark.  The CCDs try to adjust, and you get noise.
Rather than compressing 8:1 using byte parity,
I'd recommend using a hash function, such as MD5 or SHA,
which means that every bit of the input can tweak any bit of the output.
That's the Bic Pen model of "you'll lose it before you use it up" :-)
If you're using it strictly for session key exchange,
that's a lot of sessions (unless you're a big web or email server.)
If you're using it for message encryption, it's obviously not much.

There was a bombing at a mall in Finland last week,

a 19-year-old chemistry student, who frequented a message board
"Forum for Home Chemistry".  The 17-year-old moderator of the board
was arrested for a couple of days, but then released.
Some more excerpts from Helsinkin Sanomat:
The Constitutional Law Committee heard from various internet experts during its meeting on Wednesday. After the meeting, committee Chairwoman Paula Kokkonen was not willing to comment on whether something should be done differently by the committee because of the Myyrmanni incident.
The question of whether or not internet chatrooms and message boards are, by definition, publications, is still in the open.
Centre Party MP Johannes Leppdnen, a member of the Constitutional Law Committee, commented that it is now necessary to ponder if incidents such as the Myyrmanni bombing could be prevented with more careful monitoring.     "However, I hope that a momentary situation is not taken advantage of in a way that would limit some fundamental rights", Leppdnen stated. He also pointed out that the question of internet supervision has not been solved anywhere else either, nor has the question of responsibility for online information.

Sigh.  If people are going to beat up on BrinWorld, at least they
should get it right.  Brin's Transparent Society stuff makes two points
- Cameras, networks and similar technology are going to keep getting cheaper,
          so you're going to lose your privacy.  Give up on that now.
- Governments _are_ going to take advantage of this, like it or not,
          so what the public has to do is make sure that we're allowed to
          watch the government as well.
Brin may be naively optimistic about our ability to succeed on the second part,
but he's spot on about the asymmetry of power relationships,
and he's constantly making the point that we can only watch the government
if we force them to let us watch - the alternative is that they'll be
watching us and we won't be watching them.
Delaying technology?  It's easier to do on stuff that doesn't work well,
and it sounds like this doesn't - perhaps the way to do it is to
deflect the research away from surveillance into medical directions;
since Darpa's funding it, get them to look at how to help soldiers carry
heavy backpacks safely or spooks to carry dead bodies safely or whatever.

Also, until recently, there was the problem that storing a hash value
for every IP address took 8-10 bytes * 2**32, and the resulting 32-40GB
was an annoyingly large storage quantity, requiring a deck of Exabyte tapes
or corporate-budget quantities of disk drive, which also meant that
sorting the results was also awkward.  These days, disk drive prices
are $1/GB at Fry's for 3.5" IDE drives, so there's no reason not to have
120GB on your desk top.
This does mean that if you're keeping hashed logs you should probably
use some sort of keyed hash - even if you don't change the keys often,
you've at least prevented pre-computed dictionary attacks over the
entire IPv4 address space, and the key should be long enough (e.g. 128 bit)
so that dictionary attacks on the "IP addresses of Usual Suspects"
also can't be precomputed.
A related question is keeping lists of public information,
e.g. don't-spam lists, in some form that isn't readily abusable,
such as hashed addresses.  The possible namespace there is much larger,
but the actual namespace isn't likely to be more than a couple of billion,
in spite of the number of spammers selling their lists of 9 billion names.
There's the question of how exact a match do you need -
if mail is for alice+tag1 at example.com, you'd ideally like to be able to check
alice+tag1 at example.com, alice at example.com, and which makes the lookup process more complex.

URL: SAN MATEO, Calif. Â Fifteen companies announced Tuesday [April 8] they have formed the Trusted Computing Group, an industry initiative to define and promote a specification for security in PCs, servers, PDAs and cellphones.
The group essentially reboots the efforts of the now-disbanded PC-centric Trusted Computing Platform Alliance (TCPA), this time including participation from Nokia and consumer electronics companies such as Sony and Philips.
The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) expects to release a specification for PC security before the end of the year. A spec for cell phones, however, could be as much as two years away.
Founding members of the TCG are carryovers from the earlier 190-member TCPA effort. They include AMD, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel and Microsoft. Contributing members include Atmel, Infineon, National Semiconductor, Nokia, Philips, Phoenix Technologies, Sony, ST Microelectronics, VeriSign and Wave Systems.
The TCPA defined a trusted platform module (TPM), a basic device with encryption and secure memory capabilities to oversee PC security. However the TPM 1.1 chips now shipping from companies such as Atmel, Infineon and National Semiconductor have not been widely adopted to date and do not conform to concepts for a secure PC execution mode recently defined by Microsoft under a program it called Palladium.
The TCG is defining a specification for a 1.2 version TPM and a software stack that will work with the Palladium architecture Microsoft developed in collaboration with Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices. Microsoft will detail this approach publicly for the first time at the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference in May.
Microsoft's implementation, which it now calls the Next Generation Secure Computing Base (NGSCB), will require new logic in several PC components including processors, chip sets, graphics processors and I/O devices. Indeed, the concept for a secure operating mode is so broad Microsoft will devote an entire track at WinHEC Â about 18 hours of content Â to describing it.
Microsoft has not said, however, when it will ship software that complies with NGSCB. Industry watchers expect that code will appear late next year or early in 2005 in the next major version of Windows, dubbed Longhorn.
The security scheme will work in conjunction with processor functions Intel Corp. calls Le Grande Technology and has embedded in its next-generation Pentium processor dubbed Prescott, expected to ship later this year. AMD will also support the PC security concepts in its processors though it has not indicated when.
The TPM 1.2 modules will include a new session encryption interface and secure state counters that prevent replay security attacks, said Stephen Heil, a technical evangelist for security at Microsoft. The TCG has separate working groups defining those modules, a security software stack and particular needs for both servers and PDAs. The TCG is about to launch a working group to define a specification for secure cellphones, an effort that could take 18 to 24 months. Nokia is expected to be a key contributor to that group in addition to other members still being recruited by the TCG.
ÂI would expect to see our membership broaden to include many of the players required for that effort,Â said Geoffrey Strongin, a security specialist at AMD.
Jim Ward, chair of TCG and a security specialist with IBM, said the group would like to create other specifications for platforms such as set-top boxes and video game consoles though no active efforts are currently underway. ÂWe are looking to develop a broad specification that can be used by a broad set of products,Â he said.
ÂThe industry is coming together,Â said John Hull, director of marketing for advanced PC products at National Semiconductor.
ÂWe are thoroughly convinced that the future of the PC rests on three legs: networking, security and manageability. You will have to have all three to play in PCs going forward,Â he added.
Hull said he expects TPM module makers will update their products to comply with the new security spec when Prescott processors roll out this fall. Further in the future, the modules could be integrated into existing PC components such as SuperI/O parts that provide legacy support for serial, parallel, keyboard and floppy controllers.
ÂIBM is about the only company in production with systems using the [standalone] TPM 1.1 devices as far as I know,Â said Hull.
Ward said IBM has shipped millions of TPM devices in its PC systems. An HP spokesman said the company has not yet shipped systems with the modules which typically cost about $5.
ÂWe have to increase the rate of adoption. That's why integration with Super I/O makes a lot of sense. We think this will be a checkbox item going forward,Â Hull added.
As a legally incorporated group, the TCG will enforce reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing of any intellectual property in the spec and define a mechanism to certify compliance to it. The group is also expected to take a more pro-active approach than its predecessor to addressing controversial issues about privacy and digital rights raised by the PC security effort.

Smoke away - the situation is both better and worse than you think :-)
H.323 isn't quite dead, but the impressions I've gotten before and at
the recent Voice On The Net conference are that SIP is pretty much taking over,
and H.323 is at least resting and pining for the fjords,
even if nobody's nailed its feet to the perch yet.
And some people have addressed encryption issues with SIP, though I'm not
sure of the exact standards status.
H.323 looks a lot like some of the ISDN protocols -
designed by people who didn't really have a clue about how to make things
work well on the Internet, but who did like complex and ugly features.
SIP isn't perfect, and it apparently has some issues with NAT,
but it's a fairly well-behaved Internet-like standard,
and there was a lot of work done to make things extensible and modular
and let services be provided by networks of servers rather than monoliths.
While H.323 is ugly and doomed, it can be used for direct user-to-user calls,
and Microsoft did everybody a major favor a few years ago with Netmeeting,
which does H.323 for audio, video, and shared whiteboarding, for free,
and while it doesn't do conferencing well, it's quite usable for person-to-person calls
as long as there's no NAT in the way and everybody runs it,
plus it can use an IIS server for tracking who's on.
And you can run it over IPSEC, though there's usually overhead.
The basic problem SIP tries to solve is to have some method of tracking
user presence, and telling users who want to talk to each other how to reach
the others systems, with a bunch of optional extra activities like multi-person calls.
(If that sounds like what H.323 does, yes, that's true,
but H.323 feels like it was designed by someone much worse at programming
than Microsoft, vs. solving the same problems on Unix.)
If all you wanted to do was let SIP users talk to other SIP users,
this would be pretty simple, but that's not the main market -
real systems need to talk to existing phone networks as well,
and they need to provide many of the standard business features like voicemail
and different types of conferencing, and those add lots of complexity.
The two main environments this can run in are PBXs (phone switch on
customer premises, run by the customer, getting some long-haul from a carrier)
and Phone Companies, either local or long distance, who own the
old phone infrastructure, may have better economies of scale,
and often provide Internet service as well as telephony.
IP telephony has lots of ways to build hybrids, and economies of scale
matter a lot less in a Stupid Network with the control functions
happening on glorified PCs than they did with 1960s phone switches.
 From the perspective of a Phone Company, the hardest problems with
the emerging IP telephony market involve figuring out how to make money
while the whole industry is collapsing around us (:-),  and some of those
methods involve finding new and innovative features that we can provide
slightly better than other ISPs because we have a hundred years of experience.
(Yes, I realize that the hundred years of experience involves lots of
dead weight and useless baggage :-)
One of the annoying pieces of baggage that phone companies have in many
countries is regulation, and in the US, that includes the CALEA wiretapping which apply to us and don't appear to apply to
businesses providing their own phone service using equipment they buy from
hardware and software vendors like Cisco and MS, or to those vendors.
This annoying baggage not only shows up when we plan consumer telephony which is mostly in the future, it also shows up when we reply to RFPs from
businesses that want people to manage their telephone systems for them.
It is not only annoying because it's an offensive invasion of privacy,
it's annoying because it's really hard to implement well in an evolving tech environment,
and it's annoying because we and some of our competitors have to do it
while others of our competitors don't have to.
But in a SIP world, there's not much difference between a wiretap
and a conference call where one party is on mute, and it's
really really easy to build fancy calling features like conferencing.
At Voice On The Net last week, our development people were demonstrating
interesting systems like "You're on a phone call at your office, and you want
to go home but the people you're talking to won't shut up,
so you tell your phone to conference in your cellphone,
which connects in silently without losing anybody from the call, and you drive home,
and when you get there you press keys on your analog cellphone to tell the
call that you now want it to switch to the software phone on your PC,
and tell the popup window on your PC that you also want the call to play
on the speaker in the kitchen while you get yourself a beer".
Another generic kind of demo they did was follow-me numbers -
the Centrex knows that when you get a call (IP or old-style),
it should first try ringing your desk and your lab phone simultaneously
and if you don't answer at either of those, try your cell phone if
it's before midnight or the caller is on your buddy list.
Letting the FBI join in on your call isn't too hard,
if they can tell the call control system what to do - the hardest part is
finding a way to let all the different kinds of phones Not Warn The User,
since most phones are really just software, and the software writers like to
add features like "Hey, Bob just joined your conference, do you want to send
him the draft of the memo, and do you want to add in his video?"
and "Find who's using Music-on-Hold and delete their MP3 collection".
It's somewhat different for two-party pure-SIP calls, which can go while some of the more complex call types run the voice bits through
the call manager or conference bridge so it has a handle to build things with,
but of course the calls can often be moved between those environments.
 has a nice list of
SIP phones (software and hardware, including free software.)
Grandstream makes a nice $75 SIP phone as well.
There's a lot of other open source telephony work, much of it
sponsored by hardware vendors trying to facilitate their sales.  Google.
You can take SIP or H.323 and run them through IPSEC tunnels,
but there turn out to be some annoying inefficiencies -
the IP and RTP headers take up a lot of space, often turning 8kbps
compressed voice into about 22-24kbps.  You can run compressed headers
(cRTP is sort of like the old cslip), cutting it down to 11-12kbps,
but only over raw Layer 2 transport, not over IPSEC, which also adds headers.
It's cleaner to do the crypto along with the voice compression,
and the SIP standards support that (but I don't know how many people use it),
though of course anything the SIP helps to set up, the SIP can set up wiretaps for.
The other piece of really annoying telco regulation baggage is 911
(emergency telephone service, which some of you non-US folks dial 999 for.)
Unlike wiretapping, which is inherently offensive, this part is mainly
annoying because it's a hard problem, and regulations can make it
impossible for telcos to bid on projects without solving it,
plus it's something that customers actually want, unlike wiretapping.
With Real Telco Telephones, the phone number tells you what building
a phone is in, so 911 can send the fire truck to the right building.
With IP telephones, the gateway to the phone company might not be
on the same side of the continent as the phone, so calling the local fire is a bad idea, and you can plug your phone in anywhere (if it's hardware)
or run your phone software from any PC, maybe over a VPN,
so your phone number isn't always in the _same_ wrong place.
Some of the IP PBX makers have crude hacks for the problem, but it's hard.

My neighbor has been flying a flag on our shared balcony for a couple of years (aargh...)  He's a retired pilot, who when he was young was in the Navy; his job was to fly bombers off aircraft carriers and drop nukes on targets, which he said he wouldn't do now.  When the war started, I asked him to take it down.  He agreed to take it down in a week, unless there were WMDs used in the US, but that it was expressing his concern for the soldiers over there, and also told me that his wife was strongly against the war, and what he'd done in the Navy.  A couple days later the flag was down, and he'd said that he'd decided that Bush was lying about all this WMD stuff.
On the other hand, at least from what's in the news,
the number of Iraqis killed in this war has been pretty low
( estimates 1100-1400),
which is probably pretty close to the number of people killed
by dictatorships and other evil governments that the US is supporting,
and it's only 4-5 times the number of people Bush had killed as governor of More to the point, it's less than the average death rate that the
UN estimates has been caused by the destruction of the water supplies
in the last war and subsequent embargo (about 100K/year.)
So if getting rid of Saddam leads the US to rebuilding Iraq for PR reasons,
or at least gets rid of the embargo and lets the Iraqis rebuild,
things may get better.  (On the other hand, after the war's over,
we'll probably find that there were a lot more deaths,
mainly in bombed buildings.)

It's a difficult problem - claiming that land is your private property
implies a willingness to initiate force to enforce your rights,
which is different for something like land that you didn't create
than for objects that you did create.
But if you can't collect "stuff", you can't insure yourself against
starving to death in the short term or the more distant future,
and governments in during the last century made a habit of
declaring that all the land and stuff in a given area was theirs,
and either starving the local population to death (if they were totalitarians)
or forcing them to leave (if they were merely greedy) or just killing them.
If you're looking at the world as a whole, as opposed to just the US and Canada and
parts of Western Europe that aren't near Germany, insecurity about such things
unfortunately demonstrates a realistic maturity.
If you live in a society that guarantees liberty and the pursuit of happiness,
you still need to plan for your old age, and you do that by collecting stuff,
or by collecting friends and kids who will care for you.
Societies that don't let you collect stuff are forcing you to
depend on them for your food and housing - not much liberty there.
People who are especially good at acquiring and managing stuff can
retire at 35 (:-), and people who don't have families to support can
argue about whether they've got more liberty or happiness with less stuff

There are at least three interesting GPS failure modes
- Whole system fails at once
- Whole system becomes less accurate
- Local areas get jammed
The article's talking about a failure mode where the satellites
gradually wear out over a couple of years and nobody replaces them.
 From a telco perspective, this is annoying, because GPS is cheaper
and better than what we used to do before we adopted it about 5 years ago,
and we've got a few hundred billion dollars less ready cash then we did then,
and the people who really knew synchronization well have mostly retired
or moved to dotcoms, but we could always hire enough of them back to do the job
for a lot less money than it would take to redesign GPS,
on the off-chance that we haven't replaced enough of the old phone infrastructure with VOIP
for it to simply Not Matter by then.  It's not like this is Air Traffic [Summary:  If you blew GPS out of the sky without warning,
major telco synchronization would degrade a bit but not much,
voice calls would be more likely to get noise, but not much,
internet connections might have a fractional percent more TCP retransmits,
and a random number of things that didn't have other timing sources would break
until people fixed them.  Cell phone systems are the big telecom uncertainty,
and of course Air Traffic Control, nuclear missiles, and similar apps.]
As Tyler said, SONET synchronization is a complex topic,
and telco synchronization is more complex than that.
There are two basically separate problems
- timestamping / NTP Network Time Protocol, used by lots of Internet stuff,
- synchronization used in synchronous telco transmission media,
Everybody uses GPS for everything these days, because they _can_,
but high-end GPS equipment is about 5 orders of magnitude more accurate
than the most demanding NTP things ISPs use it for,
and cheap GPS equipment usually gets you millisecond precision,
which is about 3 orders of magnitude more than most things care about,
and most of them don't care very much.  WWV radio clocks were Really Just Fine,
and ISPs who needed better clocking could build decent NTP systems.
Routers don't care much about phase, because each T1 or fiber interface
usually gets timing from the transmission line independently.
Voice transmission equipment cares more about phase,
because it uses Time Division Multiplexing to switch the voice bits,
so a whole voice switch runs on the same clock source -
it it's talking to somebody else whose clock is different and
drifts by more than the line buffers can fix, it drops a frame of bits
or adds a frame of 0s, which will cause brief noise on voice calls
or trash one or two data packets.  Telcos care about this because they
not only care about voice quality, they have SLAs with customers
for the number of errored seconds per day/month/etc.
that cost money that cost money if they don't meet them,
but it takes a lot to get down to cell-phone-in-traffic quality.
Telecom sync equipment is categorized in different strata,
and normally a box will have a clock that accepts timing from outside
and has a Stratum-N-quality holdover clock inside that's guided by the feed.
There are lots of different ways to measure the accuracies of these things.
A Stratum 1 clock is whatever master timing source you're using,
and a Stratum 2 clock is supposed to be able to hold its own for about 5 days
before the first slip and not do more than a slip every couple hours after A Stratum 3 clock can slip about 10/hour the first day and 132/hour SONET needs somewhere between Stratum 3 and Stratum 4 to stay connected.
The best timing feeds between buildings run on copper T1s, not fiber.
GPS is Stratum 1 quality, as long as you've got a good holdover clock,
typically Stratum 2 quality for telco offices.
A decade ago, a main AT&T, MCI, or Sprint office would have
a feed from a Stratum 1 source, and a Stratum 2 clock of its own,
and would feed a bunch of smaller offices which had their own clocks.
MCI and Sprint tended to use Loran for some of their timing sources;
AT&T used really expensive clocks in main offices, and had more offices.
An important concept for AT&T is the Building Integrated Timing Source -
there's a master clock for each building that feeds all the hardware.
Most of the other professional telcos do something similar;
I'm not sure if all the upstart newcomers do.
Since then, most AT&T offices have their own GPS clock,
except a few percent with Bad Radio Magic or building issues
which get fed by other nearby offices.
I'm not sure how local telcos get their timing - presumably a similar
combination of GPS, local clocks, and feeds.  They have more small offices
which are closer together, but also the clocks keep getting cheaper.
Cellular systems are the main telco case I don't understand;
some of the newer systems care much more about timing,
but the application that needs the most precision is 911 location,
because that needs to triangulate between multiple offices
as opposed to just handing off calls at the optimum time to avoid drops.
It's possible that something could go wrong here,
but I'd guess that cell towers are also more likely to be fed by copper T1s,
which would give them excellent sync if they need it.
(GPS is also useful for finding the precise location of a tower,
which phone-locator ICBM-delivery apps care about,
but you only need to do that once; the things don't move except in at least with some of the newer systems, but I'd be surprised.

@_subject: double-spending prevention w. spent coins 
As Doug Barnes put it, if your algorithm has to exercise the
"then haul them off to jail" step, you've failed.
The two basic models of digital cash clearing have been
- embed some identity model into the coins, which is revealed by
         double-spending, and then do something grouchy if you detect it
- always honor the first use of a coin and reject future uses,
         and let the users fight over failed spending attempts.
Depending on what you're trying to accomplish with your digital cash,
one mode or the other may be useful.  Hettinga would probably contend that
the first-use model is much cheaper and more efficient,
because it avoids the costs of creating and tracking user identities
and tieing it to the world in book-entry fashion.
If you're trying to use it for something like remailer tokens
rather than real cash, that's certainly the case.
On the other hand, the identity-embedding models have tended to be
more prominent around Cypherpunks, partly because it has its own
technically interesting characteristics, and may have problems
that it can solve, but also because it prevents some kinds of fraud,
such as making it harder for the bank to claim that a coin has already been Offline is much much harder than online.
Sure it was :-)  But it's stuff that's been done now, mathematically.
Doing it in practice is still hard, which is why almost nobody's done it
in practice, and not for very long.  Back when this stuff was new and exciting,
there was an attempt to form an Austin Cypherpunks Credit Union,
and the proprietors found that not only was doing business with David Chaum
a difficult unsolved problem (:-), but in fact finding a business model
that would let them make money at it was even harder.

That only works if you've modified your protocols to identify the ages of for instance by rotating what signature parameters the bank uses.
Otherwise somebody can walk in with a used P+1-old coin and spend it again.
If you do modify the protocols to identify coin or signature batches,
and delete older batches of coins, you have to also refuse to cash them,
like checks that say "Not valid after 90 days" or whatever.
This implies that users will be required to come in and exchange coins
every so often before they expire, or lose their money.
For most markets, this may be ok with appropriate time periods,
but for other applications, it might not be.
One alternative is to keep only the new batches in high-speed storage,

They already invented that one for Afghanistan.
It's one thing to treat Al Qaeda that way (an evil thing, of course),
but it's quite another to treat the Taliban that way.
They were the government of their country, and the US invaded them.
The US government contends that it was justified because they were
harboring and supporting Osama bin Laden, who made war on the US;
if so, that may make them a government at war with us,
in which case they should be treated as POWs,
and if they're going to hang them like defeated Nazis war criminals,
they're supposed to give them a Nuremberg-style trial first.
But it doesn't give the US the right to torture them to death
without a trial after the war's over.
And if you're going to call somebody "illegal", that implies
that you're following legal processes, which isn't happening here.
Furthermore, the US government asserts that it has no requirement
to follow US laws outside the US borders, and that
Guantanamo Bay is a Legally Special Place, outside the laws of mankind,
because US law doesn't apply there since it's not US territory,
but Cuban law has no power there because it's occupied by the US military.
Perhaps the pre-Castro Cuban government has legal authority there?
Are there any old Mafiosi who want to claim it's theirs,
or any old Batista-governent-in-exile geezers in Miami that are willing
to order the Marines to follow old Cuban law?
Are there still more IRA Republicans in Boston than Bush Republicans?
Is it time to call the Bush Republicans "illegal combatants" for
failing to stomp out the other Republicans?

         You don't even need a smartcard; a data file format that uses
         some kind of password-based encryption is enough.
         Smart cards, or dumb cards, may or may not be a useful adjunct
         to some digital cash systems, but one of the big reasons for using
         digital cash instead of 500-Euro banknotes is for online transactions.
         Smartcards may let you use your digital cash at somebody else's cash reader,
         and may reduce the risk of software problems trashing your cash,
         but digicash isn't necessarily something most people will carry          Now, *that's* an interesting suggestion.
         Not any time soon :-)  It's much more likely that the issuing bank
         or the wallet vendor would be in this business than a third party,
         and there are problems like how to preserve the anonymity,
         how to know the card has enough cash in it to justify a reward
         (I suppose you can guess that from whether the owner sends in a
         reward offer to the clearinghouse), how to escrow the reward payments, etc.
         For some sets of applications, you could do just as well peer-to-peer;
         have the finder post to Blacknet that he possesses a card with
         a serial number that hashes to 02198734, the owner sends a few
         digits of the serial number or a keyed hash to confirm,
         and they agree on a mailbox to snail the card to and a reward price,
         maybe 50% paid before and after delivery or using an escrow service,
         Obviously, the serial number can't be revealed in transactions,
         so maybe it's just printed on the front, or maybe it's used in the
         encrypted file formats on the card as a PIN-strengthener or something.
         If you like creeping featurism, you can design the card interface
         to have multiple money compartments, including one that you use
         to store $20 to pay off finders of lost cards...
         Or you just limit use of smartcards to money you're willing to lose,
         or are only storing in the cards when you're planning to use it,
         e.g. downloading a few hundred bucks to take to your coke dealer

I think the apartment in the Netherlands is probably different than their

On the other hand, one nice thing about that area is that if they

I don't know if it's as easy to confuse the US and Canada about

I'm skeptical about any of those cases except the last...

unless they were lying from the beginning there too.
(Actually, I'm rather surprised they haven't officially found them yet,
because the US did give Saddam quite a lot of that stuff when he was their but perhaps the wrong people in Iraq have it...)

It may not be Fair, but it's a bit more Balanced :-)
Of course, much of this may be a play by the "Senior US Defense Officials"

rather than commentary by the news media,
and/or an attempt to distance themselves from a couple of
unpopular programs by sticking it on the designated fall guy,

while Fox News says "The admiral who developed two controversial
Pentagon database programs quickly killed by Congress" and
goes on to make it clear that it's that nasty Congress's fault
for refusing to fund Poindexter's cool programs.
The real question is whether the administration and officials
that rehired Poindexter and hired Ashcroft and Homeland Security
will continue the same kinds of attacks on US civil liberties

If you look at the usage models and threat models,
it's simply not a problem.  This is a disk drive.
Anybody who has access to disk drive transactions
sufficient to try replay attacks already has deep-level
access to your hardware, so you're toast anyway
because they can see the unencrypted data before it's written.
What this kind of system is normally good for
is making sure that anybody who steals your hardware
when it's not running can't read your disk's data.
(Steals includes thieves with and without warrants or subpoenas...)
There's not really a risk of replay attacks there.
However, there's an emerging application for which
disk drives are more vulnerable, which is remote storage.
Some of the new disk interface standards, like Fibre Channel,
and probably some of the flavors of iSCSI,
can operate over distances of 20km and longer over fiber,
leading to businesses like colocation centers in New Jersey
providing big disk drive farms for New York City financial businesses
which have their mainframes in Manhattan.
For applications like that, it is important to do good IVs,
because control of the disk drive doesn't imply control of the machine.

@_subject: Slow but interesting sender-hiding covert channel program 
Rob Lemos reports on the following presentation at Blackhat
by Mark Loveless of Bindview; I've got some comments.
The technique works by hiding four bytes of data in the
TCP header's ISN field, bouncing packets off one or more
innocent third-party machines, setting your destination IP address
to the third-party and forging your recipient's IP as the source,
so the recipient appears connection accepts or rejects
from real, fake, or random locations, and the real message
is hidden in the header fields.  The connection type can be
something credible like email or http.
Of course, there _are_ ISPs that do spoof-proofing,
so if your ISP does this, you won't be able to forge the
recipient's address on your outgoing packets usefully.
Spoof-proofing usually limits you to addresses in the
subnet used by your internet connection - if you've got a /24,
you can impersonate one of 254 locations near yours,
but if anybody's seriously trying to track you, you're busted.
There's also the problem that, unless it's sending call setups
that the recipient is rejecting, there'll be a lot of half-open
TCP connections on the recipients, which is a DOS problem.
It's cute, though.
Also, Bindview's security tools site does have an interesting
spoofing-detection program that works by looking at TTL values
for packets you receive that are suspected of being spoofed -
it traces a connection to/from the purported source IP address
and sees whether the time-to-live field on the suspicious packet
is close enough to one from the real route to be believable
or declares it to be bogus if it's too far off.

It's a rigged game, and the "20 years extra for terrorism"
raises the stakes substantially from the usual
"1 year if you plead, or 3-4 years if you fight and lose" deal.
(In my case, the plea bargain was "We'll drop the obviously bogus charge
if you stipulate that you don't have grounds to sue us",
and given how the judge treated the other cops in his court,
chickening out and taking it was probably the correct decision.)
No, it's *not* Prisoner's Dilemma.  The cops almost never have
anything to lose by accepting a shorter sentence,
except in highly publicized politically important cases,
or by losing an occasional case, and their costs for going to trial
are low enough that, while they save money by pleading out most cases,
it's basically a minimal cost compared to the accused's costs.
(The Prison Guards Union makes a bit less money on it,
but it leaves them room to keep some drug user in jail a bit longer,
and in any case it's not enough money to turn the game into
the classic Prisoner's Dilemma.)
Sometimes there's a case like OJ which creates really bad publicity
for them if they lose, and sometimes they've got a
Johnny Walker Lindh who could give them serious constitutional problems
if they have a trial, but all of those are pretty rare,
though they _are_ Prisoner's Dilemma cases.
Most people they try are either guilty of something,
and the real issue is exactly how many counts of what they're guilty of
and how much they ought to be punished.
Most of the rest of them are the wrong person accused by mistake,
in which case if they lose they can be really sorry and
announce how glad they are that their mistake was noticed,
or they're some quality-of-life crime where dragging the
accused through the process and keeping him in jail for a few nights
or a few months keeps the sheeple in line even if they lose.
(That's especially appropriate for most political-protest cases -
you block traffic for the afternoon, they beat you and throw you in jail
for the weekend, and maybe keep you in a couple extra days.)

They had what looked like a legitimate security / privacy product,
and were upfront about the threat models being regulators and anti-trust cops.
While it's hard to tell from the web site, it looks like
they've still got the same basic technical model -
instead of sending raw text, you're sending text encrypted using a key
that you fetch from a key server, and when the recipient wants to view it,
the recipient runs a viewer that fetches a decryption key.
The policy enforcement runs on the key server,
which deletes keys when the policy says the document should expire,
and apparently places some controls on who it's willing to hand keys to.
People save stuff all the time, and forget it, and backup systems often save it
even if they didn't explicitly try to save it themselves.
By shipping the sensitive messages as encrypted files,
the Save functions are only saving the encrypted version, not the cleartext.
On the other hand, I don't know how much their integration with Outlook breaks it.
You can set up your policy servers to set who's allowed to fetch keys.
There's no indication on the web site about how much granularity this has,
or how much protection or authentication they really do.
Policy servers are run by the company using the system, not by Omniva,
so you're still dependent on their competence as well as their honesty,
and if they want to ship a broken system, it's not hard to hide it
(e.g. use a compromised random number generator for the keys.)

Lots of problems are only computable in exponential time,
or at least superpolynomial time.
The closest we'd get to your suggestion is that
P might equal NP, or (for crypto) factoring might be in P.
Sufficiently large polynomials are easier in theory than in practice -
Karmarkar's polynomial solution to Linear Programming was
something like N**12 or L*N**6 where L was a very large number.
We wouldn't have to go back to OTP, just symmetric-key keyservers
which people used before public-key became well-known.
While the public-key algorithms are based on math problems like
factoring or discrete log, most of the symmetric-key algorithms
are based on intractable ugliness, and on doing enough analysis
to find out which kinds of ugliness and bit-twiddling are really

If the polynomial computability comes from quantum computers,
some of the symmetric stuff seems to reduce from 2**N time to 2**(N/2) time,
so we might need to upgrade from 3DES to 5DES or 7DES, but it's not big deal.

Fearghas pointed out the obvious workaround for this,
which is that if you don't like AOL's policies on incoming or outgoing email, or your cable modem provider's policies*
(which in the US are pretty much guaranteed to be lame),
or the cheapest DSL provider around,
but you want to keep them because they're cheap or have
other features you like, then fine, just use them for Internet packet forwarding,
and find yourself an email provider with policies you like.
You don't need to find all of them - you only need one.
There are about 10,000 ISPs in the US, last time I looked,
plus hundreds to thousands of hosting and colo providers who will
sell you at least a virtual host, plus myriads of customers of
hosting providers who have the resources to run an email business,
plus hundreds of thousands of unemployed former dot-commers
who'd probably be interested in starting a business if they can't
find themselves an employer, and at least 50% of them have the capital required to start a small email provider business,
and at least 10% of them have enough capital to start a medium business,
big enough to get going if they can find customers.
That means that if just 0.01% of those people or businesses
agree with you about how the email business really should be run,
then there are probably a dozen or so that claim to be just what you want,
and at least half a dozen that are actually competent.
If just 1% of them agree with you, then there are thousands of them.
Go use Google and go find them, or post a message in the appropriate newsgroups asking for them.
If you *can't* fund a dozen providers like that, much less a thousand,
then obviously the collective wisdom Internet community doesn't agree with your ideas well enough to justify making a law against
how the other 99% or 99.99% of email providers run their businesses.
Furthermore, if you think you're RIGHT, not just about how you want
_some_ ISP to run a service so you can get what you want for your email,
but COSMICALLY, STALLMANESQUELY RIGHT about how every ISP should be run,
then don't try to convince some technically clueless Congresscritter,
get off your ass and go convince people.  By the time you've convinced
20% of the customers that that's what ISPs should do,
and convinced 20% of the ISPs, everybody else will get the clue.
And if you want to get rich while doing so,
as opposed to merely popular like Stallman (:-),
one of the best ways to do it is to set up a business and
show the other ISPs what a REAL mail server looks like
while millions of customers show up at your doorstep
(hmmm, that's back to the "get off your ass" bit again),
or more realistically, dozens show up which gets you enough user feedback
to tweak the service and advertising to attract hundreds of users,
which brings in enough cash flow to advertise to get thousands,
at which point you've had trouble scaling and have redesigned
to something actually scalable, which is a bit tough at $5/month * 1000 users,
and then the world beats a path to your door because somebody's
finally heard of you.

@_subject: IRS loses a big one? 
Nah, just a small loss.  It's good to beat them, but hard to repeat,
and they're playing a numbers game.
There are good points and less good points to jury trials.
One of the good parts is that a jury can acquit you for any reason
that they want to, if you can convince them to.
On the other hand, jury verdicts don't set precedents the way
judge verdicts can, and jury verdicts of Not Guilty
can't be appealed, so there's no way to get them escalated
to a wider area, unlike a judge's declaration that
a law is unconstitutional, which applies to whatever territory
that judge has jurisdiction over (whether that's a city
or a Federal District or whatever), though they're useful precedent.
That doesn't mean that winning with a jury isn't a Good Thing :-)
But in particular, even a fully-informed jury that's judging the law
is normally just judging how and whether the law applies to a
particular case, and most jury decisions are really about
the facts of the case or at most how the law applies to those facts.
This jury decided that the IRS had failed to prove that
Kuglin violated any laws about what papers she had to file
or how she had filed any that she did file.
That doesn't mean that she doesn't owe any taxes,
or that the IRS can't find a way to get money from her,
such as garnishing her wages in the future,
or even that any papers she did file were correct -
only that the IRS had failed to prove they were punishably wrong.
(It doesn't even necessarily mean that the way she handled
her papers *wasn't* punishably wrong - only that the IRS
didn't give a sufficiently convincing argument that
the laws their lawyer likes to quote apply to the actions she took
or didn't take in the way that the lawyer contends that they apply.)
In particular, based on the two newspaper articles,
it sounds like the IRS mouthpiece was saying that
Kuglin could and should have had a conversation with them in which
they'd have explained to her exactly where it says she had to
file things their way, and that she'd failed to do so and
was therefore a Bad Person who deserved to be Punished,
when in fact she'd sent them several letters which they'd failed to
respond to so it's their problem that the conversation
didn't go the way they wanted it to.
But hey, must've been some clerk's fault, sorry about the mistake.
The IRS did lose, which it doesn't like to do,
and it may have to find some way to salvage this case
or try to bury it, and probably a few more people will be inspired
to try to do what Kuglin did, and 10% of them might do it competently,
some percentage of them will do it incompetently and get Punished
and possibly made examples of, and most will get lost in the noise.

@_subject: Viral DNS Attack, DDos Idea 
Cute, but sounds like a lot of work compared to other obvious attacks
you could do if you're spreading a virus anyway.
The more popular version of this attack is to try to hack DNS servers,
or poison DNS requests, so that DNS requests for google report the wrong thing.
One problem with hacking the hosts files is that
different versions of Windows tend to put them in different places,
though perhaps if you target XP and 2000 and ME and 98 it's consistent enough to work.
The real question is whether the bad guys would redirect to a victim,
or to a fake web server run by them, so they could hand out
bogus responses, such as redirects to various places around the web,
potentially along with some advertising banners.
Besides making google.com harder to reach,
another effect is that lots of people send TCP SYN requests
to 66.66.66.66 port 80 instead of google.com port 80,
and if there's a web server on that port,
they send it HTTP requests for URLs on google.com,
which it presumably will reject.
If 66.66.66.66 is an arbitrary victim computer with no web server,
the main impact is a bunch of extra SYN requests,
so the obvious defense is to filter them out from the router.
If it's got a single web server, moving the server to a new IP address
and using DNS to update it can help, at the cost of disrupting
clients until its DNS update propagates, and getting its router
to drop requests for port 80 (passing other ports is fine.)
If it's a virtual server machine, though, you can't do that
without disrupting all the clients on it, which is too bad;
either hope you've got enough horsepower to handle rejecting the
google.com requests, or front-end it with a squid proxy and
kill it off there, which cuts down the CPU impact,
though it doesn't cut down the bandwidth much.
You could get fancy and have the squid redirect all the real requests
to another IP or DNS name, e.g. example1.net/stuff to example2.net/stuff,
where the new address is on a different machine and if necessary on a different access line.
If it's a router, that's a more interesting problem,
because many routers have wimpy CPUs and do the routine work in ASICs -
so if the router has an HTTP interface for admin use,
and it's not protected by ACLs for some reason,
you might blow it away with the work required to reject google hits.
But if you don't need the web interface, it's much easier to protect.
Also, if the router is in an ISP, rather than at the customer premises,
access to it may be blocked anyway, as a general security mechanism,
and even if it's not, it's usually easy to add that kind of blocking,
by null-routing the traffic rather than by ACLs.
That's actually much less of a risk, except for CPU consumption,
because if the router has enough capacity to handle google.com's traffic,
it can handle the bunch of unsuccessful SYN packets that it gets instead.
Never seen it.  Another variation on this attack is to use
random redirect addresses instead of a single target victim -
that loses the focus for detection and correction that
having a single victim can provide.
If you scatter it around, people will still have trouble reaching Google,
but almost no web servers will get enough rejected hits
to swamp them, so admins are less likely to notice.

The standard proof that all positive integers are interesting goes like this:
- 1 is the smallest positive integer.  That's interesting.
- Suppose that you've proven that 1....N are interesting.
- N+1 is the smallest integer that's not interesting.
You can extend this to all integers, and to the rational numbers
using the kinds of ordering that some of Cantor's proofs did.
Doesn't work for real numbers, though - you can have a
"nothing between X and Y is interesting, but X and Y are",
without having any smallest number above X.

The standard joke about how you tell a computer salesman

knows when he's lying.  These incompetents like taxing things,
but if they don't know what they technology is about,
they *really* *really* shouldn't propose special taxes on it until they know how to count the objects they want to tax.
A LAN isn't just hardware (which as you say the
purchasers buy sales tax on), it's also the labor
involved in installing it (which they've already
charged income tax on, if it was explicitly paid for)
and the labor involved in operating it
(which also gets income tax collected on it.)
And the prices of any of the hardware except the wire
keeps dropping rapidly.  In the last 15 years,
we've gone from $2000 1-megabit 1baseT hubs
to $20 100-meg hubs, and $1500 VAX and VME cards
to $59 GigE cards and $5 100baseT cards.
And how do you count the interface cards that are
built in to most PCs these days?
And does Wireless count as a LAN?  And if it does, can you add a directional antenna
and make it a WAN to avoid the tax?
And is this only for LANs in businesses?  Or also for LANs at home?  Or is this really an excuse for the LAN Tax Police to go around with scanners
trying to detect people who didn't register their LANs
when they were buying that Cat5 cable at the grocery store,

who hadn't paid their television taxes?

I think Declan's got the title wrong -
Lessig's discussions that he references aren't about
ending anonymity through escrowed pseudonymity -
they're about replacing some True-Name-based or linkable
applications with pseudonymous ones.  For instance,
one-use credit card numbers instead of regular numbers,
which not only makes it harder for the merchant to do
credit card fraud, but also makes it harder for
marketers to trace your activities,
even though they can go back to the credit card company
and get that information.
A similar application, which we'll unfortunately probably never see,
is to replace the SSN with a pile of one-use tax ID numbers.
That way, instead of giving everybody who needs to
collect taxes on your account the same SSN,
which they can then use to link lots of records together,
you'd be giving each one a single number that only
you and the IRS can coordinate.
An application that people use all the time
is disposable email addresses.  Sure, you can use declan at well.com
every time you give some web site your address or send email to
somebody you haven't talked to before, but eventually spammers get that
and it's too annoying; an alternative is to use free email accounts
when you think you might get spammed.  Hotmail was the canonical source,
though yahoo's easier to use these days.  One of Declan's
fellow columnists, Annalee Newitz, uses a different username at her domain
on each of her newspaper columns; presumably some of them become

Unfortunately, they also don't due much if any due diligence in

The MITM isn't going to be able to restore the original bits,

If they've replaced the message with a different message

If they've used a different stego system, or if you're using a

While James has been wrong about 90% of this discussion (:-),

initially treating him in a quasi-civilized manner.
The dude's been hiding in a hole in the ground,

(I'm puzzled by the comment about the shave, though -

On the other hand, various spokescritters keep saying
that they're going to stop treating him in a civilized manner,
and that while they're not quite going to torture him,
they're going to put him in a high-stress sleep-deprivation environment.
I'm not sure if they're going more for the Vietnamese tiger cage model,

In general, between the times the Nazi war criminals were captured

Saddam's not particularly related to the terrorists,

He is related to the anti-invader resistance, but that's fair.
He may have been involved in a plot to kill George Bush the Elder,

Either try both of them for that, or neither of them, or better,

(Of *course* I meant give them that opportunity with Saddam, not Bush...)
But making up pretenses for invasion any time people question

The US did support Saddam in the Iran-Iraq war, because he was
more in line with their interests than the Ayatollah's gang were.
However, unlike Noriega, I doubt he was a direct employee,
so if they wanted to attack him, the right channel was to declare war,
rather than to just call in CIA Internal Affairs....

As Tim pointed out, the Swastika symbol had long use before the
Nazis picked it up.  I remember going into a temple in Guangzhou China
which had three large Buddha statues with it on their chests,
and some of the Native American cultures prominently weave it
into baskets.  In Asia it tends to be a sun symbol,
or sometimes a moon symbol depending on which way it's pointing;
in the Americas it tends to be a whirlwind symbol.
If you can drag somebody into court for six months because
you don't like their speech, that's a problem too.
That doesn't mean that it doesn't happen here in the US too,
though more often for speech involving sex than violence,
and certainly our new Attorney General John Ashcroft
has no particular love for free speech.
But you can only throw someone in jail by threatening violence,
so it's hypocritical to say you're doing so to eliminate violent speech.
A friend of mine was on the city council in a Southern California town
where some Ku Klux Klan racist wanted to hold a march.
He wasn't from around there, and didn't really have any local support -
what he really wanted was for the town to ban his group from marching,
so he could sue the town for violating his right to free speech.
The town let him march, and had to bring out the police to make sure
that nobody attacked him or his five or ten friends while they marched.
It was the right thing to do, though she found it very frustrating.

This isn't suggesting that the US kept Saddam on hold for
political expediency, the way they're planning to "suddenly" "find"
Osama _and_ the Missing Weapons of Mass Destruction next October
just in time for the election.
This is just saying that it appears that some well-armed independents
(or traitorous ex-henchpersons, or whoever) caught Saddam a
couple of weeks ago and have been trying to negotiate a good price,
but the US found them and avoided paying them off.
That's believable (though of course it could be staged,
either to deceive the American public about whether we really paid them
or to make it easier for the initial captors to get away with it afterwards.)
It's therefore being suggested that while they've let Saddam
hang onto enough clean underwear for a few weeks of spider-hole time,
that they either haven't been ironing his uniforms adequately,
or else they ditched them because that someone else might catch on
and sell _them_ out for a reward.  I find this less credible.
Maybe the captors have been using his Generalissimo uniforms as evidence
to get the Americans to negotiate with them or something,
but again it's dubious.

a large amount of spam is delivered by hijacked PCs or abused relays/proxies,

Penny Black or any other system that involves tweaking the email protocols

Obviously you'd have to whitelist anybody's list you're joining

The reason it's partly a cryptographic problem is forgeries.
Once everybody starts whitelisting, spammers are going to
start forging headers to pretend to come from big mailing lists
and popular machines and authors, so now you'll not only
need to whitelist Dave Farber or Declan McCullough if you read their lists,
or Bob Hettinga if you're Tim (:-), you'll need to verify the

pretend to be from them.
You'll also see spammers increasingly _joining_ large mailing lists,
so that they can get around members-only features.
At least one large mailing list farm on which I've joined a list
used a Turing-test GIF to make automated list joining difficult,
and Yahoo limits the number of Yahoogroups you can join in a day,

Was she an actual physics professor, talking about her own field,
or some sort of literature/philosophy/sociology/politics professor?
The latter type are definitely old news, but as long as they spend their time
trying to convince female physics and mathematics professors to
think about new ways to structure or teach their curriculum, that's fine.
It's when they start dissing physics and math as "hostile to women"
and thereby discouraging young women from going into the field
that they really cause problems (as opposed to old boring sexist white male discouraging women from going into the field, which was the old problem.)
Actually doing a female-oriented physics or teaching curriculum is fine,
if somebody can do a good job of it.  After all, most of these fields
consist of real mathematics, exposure to real materials and their behaviour,
sets of metaphors for understanding how the math and behaviour are related,
and various levels of abstraction and concrete examples to interest students.
The math is the math, and the materials either will or won't cooperate,
but if feminist approaches can provide a set of metaphors or abstractions
that help students (or at least female-culture-oriented students)
understand how the math relates to the real world, then great!
And if they can find a set of examples or problems that are less male-oriented than
guns, rocketships, pushing pool cues into objects of various hardness and softness, or football
and if this helps female students be more interested in the problems,
or gives them examples that are more familiar to them, then great!
There's certainly no shortage of boring textbooks out there,
and if women who understand math and physics and communications can overcome
Sturgeon's Law and the textbook publishers' mafia or teacher selection then more power to them, and otherwise, well, the other 90% will be more

which everybody in the world will buy into, including
manufacturers, system operators, regulators, and
last and certainly least, those enthusiastic customers,
and we'll all make scandalously high profits while
giving consumers what we _know_ they want to pay tons of money for,
because we know that the technology developers are ready
to ship this stuff Real Soon Now, at the right price point,
And of course, it assumes that everybody will believe that
the products _these_ marketing people are trying to sell are
the ones that will win, as opposed to the other technology developers
who are making obviously substandard products unworthy of becoming
CellPhones: TNG, and if somehow one of those other developers
gets deployed in some significant market, they'll not only
be stuck with some hackneyed name like "2.5G", but consumers
will realize that those competing technologies are just opportunists
who'll be Left Behind By Progress, so they either won't buy it
or at least the wireless companies will dump it for
Better Stuff Real Soon, or at least if there's more than one
cell-phone company in an area, if the first one buys the 2.5G stuff,
anybody else coming in with 3G can steal their customers.

In practice, the real issues seem to be how fast a data channel

how much distance you get for the voice and data cells,
which standards interfere with which other standards,
whether voice gets handled as something special or as data,
whether data gets handled as something special like WAP
or left as open-standard IP with TCP or UDP and HTTP,
with or without being forced through filters or
able to be sent through optional filters,
how to integrate data transmission with texting
(e.g. texting using ad-hoc telco standards or internet standards),
how much jitter the data has (low values make VOIP possible),
who's in charge of each of these services,
which is to say "who gets how much of the money, if any",

@_subject: Deniable Thumbdrive? 
Agreed.  Furthermore, the whole thing is inherently dependent on the
processing model and programming interfaces of your thumbdrive.
What does it look like to your PC if you're not using the right thumb?
What does it look like to your PC if you want to use the right thumb?
Three obvious models are
- PC doesn't need Thumbdrive-specific drivers, just generic USB disk,
         and the CPU in the drive decides whether it's seen your thumb
         and reveals the otherwise-hidden files if it likes you.
- PC has specific drivers for the Thumbdrive,
         Whole drive plus the thumbprint pad are visible to the PC,
         and you can only decrypt the secret part if you put a matching
         thumb on the thumbprint.
- PC has specific drivers for the Thumbdrive
         Public drive, thumbprint pad, and hooks for secret drive are
         visible to the PC, and putting the correct thumb on the pad
         lets the PC find out the password to mount the secret drive.
First of all, as Peter says, high-tech cops won't be fooled.
Low-level goons may not recognize it,
or if the thumbprint part requires specific drivers or data on the PC,
you can tell them "sorry, that part's for access to my work PC,
and if you'd like to get a search warrant, they'll let you in the building",
and make sure the public part has some pictures of your dog or whatever.
For medium-tech cops, you can say that it requires installing drivers
on their PC (assuming that it does), and offer to download them,
and prearrange that there's a set of drivers at just in case they actually take you up on it.
Depending on the interface presented to the PC, it may or may not be obvious
to the PC whether there are zero, one, or more secret areas on the drive.
If it's not obvious, then the obvious extension to the product would be to
support multiple fingerprints for multiple secret areas, the business model
being so that multiple people can use the same drive, so your right thumb
gets your right-wing-conspiracy data, your left thumb gets your Commie stuff,
and your middle finger gets the picture of J.Edgar Hoover in his black negligee
or whatever else you want the cops to see.
Otherwise, figure out which body parts you don't mind them cutting off...

@_subject: JILT: New Rules for Anonymous Electronic Transactions? An 
There's some interesting discussion about the ability of the
Dutch legal culture to provide useful tools for regulating transactions
in anonymous or semi-anonymous environments - if you can't find somebody,
can you speak of enforcing contracts, etc.  Not surprisingly,
this has been discussed extensively by the Cypherpunks and other people
exploring applications for cryptographically-protected communications.
Some of the standard references are Tim May's "Cyphernomicon" paper (on the Orson Scott Card's novel "Ender's Game", and Vernor Vinge's story "True Names".
(As the JILT paper says, systems like this may be quite complex to actually
implement in practice, and fiction provides a good tool for exploring the
social implications without doing the difficult detail work.)
I do want to comment on the concept of pseudonymity and semi-anonymity.
The paper appears to be using a definition in which a Trusted Third Party
provides a pseudonym service, which knows the True Name behind each pseudonym
and can provide it when required for a limited number situations,
such as collecting unpaid debts or prosecuting ThoughtCrime,
but otherwise the pseudonym is adequate for many activities,
and the user can protect his privacy and conduct various activities
under different pseudonyms without them being linked to each other
or to his True Name.    Unfortunately, the definitions of ThoughtCrime
have been radically expanded in recent years, primarily due to
"intellectual property" concerns from the music and movie publishers and
the Church of Scientology, so the usefulness of these pseudonyms has
decreased, even for pure communications applications without the
anonymous digital payment systems that can enable anonymous business.
An alternative definition of pseudonymity, which is more common in the
Cypherpunks discussions, is the use of a persistent identity,
verified by digital signatures, which permits the development of
reputations without the need for True Names.  The types of businesses
that can be supported in this environment are more limited,
because there's no way to throw somebody in jail if they default,
but much of European merchant law evolved without this ability.
For some applications, "Reputation Capital" provides enough protection -
a name that's used for months or years of good transactions
or writing good essays or making good investment recommendations
has a value that will be lost if it's abused,
but for other applications, escrow services substantially increase
the types and values of transactions that are possible.
Escrow can be used on a per-transaction basis, or the escrow service
may be part of establishing a pseudonym, providing an amount of money
that can be seized in a dispute resolution process
without needing the True Name of the pseudonym-holder.
Pseudonymity is becoming increasingly common in practice.
AOL "screen names" were primarily intended to
allow multiple family members to share an account, but are also
useful for protecting privacy, especially of children in chat rooms.
There's no explicit requirement for a True Name, though most accounts
use credit cards which do provide some tracing ability,
but the depth of credit checking performed by AOL is
"did their credit card company approve paying for their service this month",
rather than "how big a transaction can their assets cover" or
"where do they sleep, in case the police want to arrest them".
Yahoo Mail and Hotmail systems are relatively untraceable, however.
EBay accounts have an organized reputation capital system,
allowing buyers and sellers to rate whether the other party has
met their obligations, and to allow prospective buyers and sellers
to see the ratings and estimate whether they'll be defrauded or not.
Unfortunately, EBay recently bought Paypal, so the privacy of
Paypal users is no longer protected by the separation between
the auction system and the payment system, since Paypal uses
credit cards and therefore semi-traceable identities to pay people.
Julf Helsingius's original Anonymous Remailer was originally intended
to provide the stronger form of pseudonymity, but unfortunately
he was forced to reveal the information he had about a user
(because of the intellectual property Throughtcrime problem),
though in fact that identity was another disposable email address.

Hey, the parties were pretty good, and RSA gave out T-shirts :-)
In practice, everybody who really needed to use RSA had
either licensed the technology for a reasonable (or too high) price,
or else was a free software developer violating the patents,
or else was a free or low-key software developer living within RSAREF.
The Mark Twain Bank people had licensed Chaum's patents,
and their failure had a lot less to do with the cost of licensing
the patent than with their inability to figure out how to
get customers and merchants, and their ability to make it
too difficult to get an account.
Mondex wasn't Chaumian, and it failed, along with a number of
other vaguely cash-like payment systems during the boom.
(I'm referring to the payment systems that handled actual money,
not just the silly Green-stamp emulators like Beenz and Flooz.)
By contrast, the Austin Cypherpunks Credit Union project
figured out that making money would be hard before starting a business,
as well as discovering that dealing with Chaum was also hard,
so they didn't get far enough to fail.
Eric Hughes had some good insights into why
"it's really hard to start a new payment system".
I supposed I'd categorize the efforts into two basic groups
- projects run by banks or bank-like companies that
wanted to actually run a service and hoped to make a profit
- startups funded by VC money that wanted to make startup money,
which depends on VCs and IPOs and Other People's Money,
and is only marginally related to actually making a profit,
though most of them also hoped they'd wildly succeed like other dotcoms.
There may have been a few other types of projects,

The catch, of course, is that most cryptosystems are only useful
if they're widely deployed.  Learning from mistakes is good,
but endangering large numbers of users in the process is bad.
By contrast, learning cryptanalysis doesn't have this weakness -
if you can't crack somebody else's code, no problem,
(with obvious exceptions for people who need to learn cryptanalysis
quickly in wartime or whatever, or undertrained cryptanalysts who are
hired by people who are learning cryptography by making mistakes...)
Even ROT-13's not too bad unless somebody tries to crack it,
though some people who've spent way too much time with it
can just read the stuff by recognizing it as an alternate font :-)
Somebody else followed up by mentioning that, while GSM's
privacy encryption is cracked, their authentication encryption isn't,
and they aren't getting massively attacked.
I thought the state of the art at this point was that the
authentication is also crackable, but it's currently enough work that
nobody's or almost nobody's bothering, because governments can get what
they want by telling phone companies to give them the information,
and regular criminals can get the equivalent of cracking GSM authentication
by stealing mobile phones more easily than by hiring cryptanalysts,
and unlike satellite TV smartcard cracking, nobody's figured out any
potential market opportunities for widespread cracked GSM.

While only a small fraction of web pages, and a much smaller
fraction of web bits transmitted, use SSL, that's appropriate,
because most web pages are material the publisher wants the public to see,
so eavesdropping isn't particularly part of the threat model,
and even integrity protection is seldom a realistic worry.
(By contrast, eavesdropping protection and integrity protection
are critical to telnet-like applications, so SSH is a big win.)
It's nice to have routine web traffic encrypted,
so that non-routine traffic doesn't stand out,
and so that traffic analysis is much harder,
but there is a significant CPU hit from the public-key phase,
which affects the number of pages per hour that can be served.
Corporate intranet web traffic carried across the public internet
sometimes uses SSL, but usually uses IPSEC because that also supports email.
In addition to web browsing and email submission,
there's an emerging market for SSL-based VPNs appliances.
Neoteris is one of the pioneers, and Aventail and some others are players.
The intention is that you can get "clientless" (browser-based)
support for intranet web browsing and email,
and lightweight client support for telnet,
while only having to buy an overpriced server box.
(And the box doesn't even need crypto accelerator help,
because the public-key phase only gets used for login,
while most sessions are long enough that this amortizes quickly.)

@_subject: Attacking networks using DHCP, DNS - probably kills DNSSEC 
Somebody did an interesting attack on a cable network's customers.
They cracked the cable company's DHCP server, got it to provide a
"Connection-specific DNS suffic" pointing to a machine they owned,
and also told it to use their DNS server.
This meant that when your machine wanted to look up yahoo.com,
it would look up yahoo.com.attackersdomain.com instead.
This looks like it has the ability to work around DNSSEC.
Somebody trying to verify that they'd correctly reached yahoo.com
would instead verify that they'd correctly reached
yahoo.com.attackersdomain.com, which can provide all the signatures
it needs to make this convincing.
So if you're depending on DNSSEC to secure your IPSEC connection,
do make sure your DNS server doesn't have a suffix of echelon.nsa.gov...
"... It turns out, Charter Communications' DHCP servers were
infiltrated and were providing p5115.tdko.com as the
'Connection-specific DNS suffix', causing all non-hardened Windows
(whatever that means in a Windows context) machines to get lookups
from a hijacked subdomain DNS server which simply responded to every
query with a set of 3 addresses (66.220.17.45, 66.220.17.46,
On these IPs were some phantom services. There were proxying Web
servers (presumably collecting cookies and username/password combos),
as well as an ssh server where the perpetrators were most likely
hoping people would simply say 'yes' to the key differences and enter
in their username/password..."
Hmm, my cable ISP was down this morning.  Maybe coincidence.

@_author: Bill Stewart 
@_subject: Attacking networks using DHCP, DNS - probably kills DNSSEC  
I thought about that, and I think this is an exception,
because this attack tricks your machine into using the
trust chain yahoo.com.attackersdomain.com., which it controls,
instead of the trust chain yahoo.com., which DNSSEC protects adequately.
So you're getting a trustable answer to the wrong query.
I'm less sure of the implementation issues of the
"Connection-specific DNS suffix", and I've seen conflicting documentation.
If the resolver looks up "domain.suffix" before "domain",
then the attacker's DNS doesn't need to control the DNS access,
and only needs to provide the attacker's certificates,
but if the resolver looks up "domain" before "domain.suffix",
then the attacker also needs to make sure that the lookup of "domain" fails,
which is most easily done by telling the DHCP client to use
the attacker's DNS server along with telling it the suffix.
(That doesn't add any extra work to the attack, but does make it
a bit easier to trace the attacker after the fact;
if you're not replacing the attacker's DNS server entry,
then all you need is a legitimate-looking server for
"*.attackersdomain.com".  In either case, somebody who can
pull off this kind of an attack probably uses a compromised machine
to run the DNS server on anyway.)
DNSSEC seems to do a pretty thorough job of making sure that
if you look up the correct domain name, you'll get the correct answer,
in spite of attackers trying to prevent it.
But this attack tricks you into looking up the wrong domain name,
and DNSSEC makes sure that you get the correct answer for the wrong name,
which isn't the result you want.

@_author: Bill Stewart 
@_subject: Attacking networks using DHCP, DNS - probably kills DNSSEC 
That doesn't happen.  (Well, it could, but as you point out,
it's not a successful attack methodology, because DNSSEC was designed
to correctly take care of this.)
The DNS suffix business is designed so that your laptop tries
to use "yahoo.com.attackersdomain.com", either before "yahoo.com"
or after unsuccessfully trying "yahoo.com", depending on implementation.
It may be bad judgement, but it's designed to support intranet sites
for domains that want their web browsers and email to let you
refer to "marketing" as opposed to "marketing.webservers.example.com",
and Netscape-derived browsers support it as well as IE.
I agree with you and Steve that this would be a Really Bad Idea.
The only way to make it secure is to use an authenticated DHCP,
which means you have to put authentication keys in somehow,
plus you need a reasonable response for handling authentication failures,
which means you need a user interface as well.
It's also the wrong scope, since the DNSSEC is global information,
not connection-oriented information, so it's not really DHCP's job.

Our experiments show that we can extract private keys from a

timing attacks against widely deployed network servers are practical.
Subsequently, software should implement defenses against timing attacks.

Schmoo Group response on cryptonomicon.net
Apparently OpenSSL has code to prevent the timing attack,
but it's often not compiled in (I'm not sure how much that's for
performance reasons as opposed to general ignorance?)
They also comment (as did somebody on Slashdot) that
"this is distinct from the timing attack described in the paper

to turn off the timing resistance is probably the better choice.
I'm not sure how flexible things need to be - real applications of the

don't need to be timing-protected, but many of them are also things

I'm not sure how detrimental an effect it would have.
Most of the evil things that the State can do don't depend on secrecy;

much more of an effect on them (i.e. people actually bothering to
watch their bureaucrats in action, as opposed to wiretapping them.)
Disrupting the banking system and online trade is much more of an issue,
because tapping the flow of money is critical to the state,
and if it's not flowing, they've got problems.
Governments like secrecy, and if they assume that they have it,
individuals working for more willing to do things that would
get them fired, shot, or hanged, and the military would have to
go back to sending guys with briefcases handcuffed to their wrists
to haul one-time pads around for tactical applications,
and jackboot-net the rest of their planning data,
which would be annoying but isn't much different from 100 years ago,
when we managed to have a War To End All Wars just fine.
Tax collectors can work perfectly well without privacy, as long as
they don't mind violating their subjects' privacy -- which they don't.
Welfare-state bureaucrats and case-workers can redistribute income

We have crypto that lets you keep your data secure against
however many iterations of Moore's Law you believe will happen

Quantum crypto could trash public-key crypto, and we'd have to resort back to
keyserver-based systems like Kerberos.
The real risks aren't from picking the front door locks -
they're from the back doors.  Smart Dust isn't very dusty yet,

but that 10000-bit RSA key and 7-DES don't do much good if you can't
enter the keys into your computer securely or read the decrypted results
without the dust on your Smart Contact Lenses also reading them
or the cameras across the room watching your eyes move
(either the hidden ones, or the wall-screen interactive TV ones)

Brinworld ain't pretty, but the important tax in the future won't be

I haven't downloaded and seen whether you need to disassemble the
free crippleware to figure out what it's really doing,
but my friend John Doe tried unsuccessfully to do so,
and perhaps a human will respond to the log messages tomorrow.
It wants some kind of public key, probably a raw hex RSA key.
Two obvious methods for them to use are
- some interesting mathematical breakthrough like Montgomery Multiplication only faster
         (ok, how to make such a breakthrough isn't obvious,
         but what to do with it if you had one is.)
- no new math, just building a modexp library that uses
         vector processing features on Intel-like chips like SSE / SSE2 / etc.

Minor technical correction - hoboes are migrant workers,
as opposed to tramps, who are migrant non-workers,
or bums, who are non-migrant non-workers,
and hoboes aren't likely to be hanging out in that kind of area,
at least during the times of year there's active gardening going on,
because that's when they're most likely to be working on farms.
That may be different down in Watsonville, where there's a lot of
railroad connectivity and a lot of farms, but up in Santa Cruz and
certainly up in Berkeley, it's much more likely to just be bums.
Yup.  Barbed wire definitely spruces up a community.....

Could you at least bouncegram the mail that you're not saving,
or else have SMTP use a reject message that says what it's doing?
That way the occasional non-whitelisted non-subscriber human

been rejected and what to do about it.

The obvious mechanisms for including it are a header line,
         X-Hashcash-Version-1212: 0x20A13490B8219048243
which is easy pretty easy for almost anybody to add.
You could also do an ESMTP extension of some sort, which is much more annoying to add,
but lets you reject non-hashcashed messages before receiving them.
(The ESMTP approach also has the problem that it's only useful for
direct connections, as opposed to mail relayed through your ISP,
so that probably isn't as interesting.)
Some of the hashcash proposals have required near-real-time interaction
between the sender's client and the recipient's server,
to collect the string of the day or string of the moment,
which has privacy/anonymity problems,
while others either use a fixed or slowly changing parameter set,
e.g. find a string that matches the first N bits of the SHA1 of
         recipient at example.com-YYYYMMDDHH
or      recipient at example.com-YYYYMMDDHH-KEYPHRASE
So the recipient's mail server or client looks for the X-Hashcash string,
makes sure it isn't recipient at example.com-YYYYMMDDHH-KEYPHRASE,
hashes it and makes sure that the number matches, and you're good to go.

Crashed Computer Traps Thai Politician
Updated 14 May 2003
  Thailand's Finance Minister Suchart Jaovisidha had to be rescued today
from inside his expensive BMW limousine after the onboard computer crashed,
leaving the vehicle immobilized.
Once the computer failed, neither the door locks, power windows nor air
conditioning systems would function, leaving the Minister and his driver
trapped inside the rapidly heating vehicle.
Despite the pair's best efforts, it took a full ten minutes before they
were able to summon the attention of a nearby guard who freed the
two men by smashing one of the vehicle's windows with a sledgehammer.
A report (
published in the Bangkok Post indicates that the vehicle was Mr
Jaovisidha's own BMW 520 which was being used while his
state-supplied Mercedes, was being repaired.
BMW's more up-market 7-series range uses a computer system called
i-drive which has Microsoft's WindowsCE at its core
Did Mr Jaovisidha narrowly miss being killed by the blue windscreen of death?

Yow!  Either Jon Stewart's Daily Show or Jay Leno last night
was quoting one of the Texas Republicans joking about
the Democrats being Terrorists for blocking the bill this way,
but apparently he wasn't totally joking.
(Daily Show also showed a bunch of people in chicken suits
mocking the Democrats, which is a perfectly appropriate response...)
Apparently they only have to hold out till sometime Friday,
but it's illegal to prevent a quorum in the legislature
so the Republicans are able to send Texas police after them.
I don't know if that law is intended to apply to outsiders preventing
a quorum or if it really does apply to walkouts like this one.

Homeland Security Department Used to Track Texas Democrats
by Glenn W. Smith
Republicans in Washington and Austin, Texas apparently used a
Homeland Security Department agency to track Texas Democratic
legislators who left the state to block passage of a GOP-backed
Congressional redistricting bill.
This is the same Homeland Security Department that is supposed to be
making America safe from foreign terrorists. It's the agency we were
told would never be used for domestic political purposes.
But today's edition of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports that the
Air and Marine Interdiction and Coordination Center, in Riverside,
California, became involved in the Republican search for 51
Democratic state representatives who went to Ardmore, Oklahoma to
break a quorum of the House and block action on the redistricting
Here's what the Star-Telegram reported: "The agency received a call
to locate a specific Piper turboprop aircraft. It was determined that
the plane belonged to former House Speaker Pete Laney." Laney is one
of the Democrats who is fighting against the redistricting bill.
The newspaper said, "Laney's plane proved to be a key piece of
information because, (Republican House Speaker) Craddick said, it's
how he determined that the Democrats were in Ardmore. 'We called
someone, and they said they were going to track it. I have no idea
how they tracked it down,' Craddick said. 'That's how we found them.'"
The Interdiction and Coordination center "falls under the auspices of
the Homeland Security Department," the Star-Telegram reported.
Republican Craddick, at the request of U.S. Rep. Tom DeLay, is
pushing a redistricting plan that would eliminate five Democrats from
the U.S. Congress. Currently, the Texas delegation contains 17
Democrats and 15 Republicans.
While saying they "called someone," Craddick denied making calls to
any federal agency, but DeLay confirmed that Republicans sought the
assistance of federal law enforcement.
The action by the House Democrats, dubbed the "Heroes of the House"
and the "Killer D's" (a reference to a similar quorum-busting action
by Texas Senate Democrats in the late 1970s), has gained national
attention. Their action has also received a surprising amount of
support from Texas newspapers, which have criticized the deeply
partisan actions of Texas Republicans.
Republican leaders in Texas and Washington are furious. They have
called the Democrats, holed up in a Holiday Inn in Ardmore, "cowards"
and "terrorists."
State troopers have followed the Democrats wives, parents and
children. Troopers even staked out a hospital where one lawmaker's
premature twins  are being cared for. Staffers have been harassed.
All this has happened after the location of the Democrats was known.
Now, in a chilling revelation, we discover  the Homeland Security
Department was apparently used to try and track the Democrats'
It was no doubt a ham-fisted, incautious and bungled attempt (like
the Watergate burglary) by Republicans to use all the law enforcement
they could find to overcome the Democrats' temporary advantage.
But the use of the Homeland Security Department for partisan
political purposes should alarm all Americans. It deserves a full,
complete and independent investigation.
The warnings of civil libertarians appear to have been justified.
Even if it turns out that some half-crazed Republican staffer or
independent investigator called the Air and Marine Interdiction and
Coordination Center, it raises disturbing questions about the
operations of Homeland Security and the lengths Republicans will go
enforce their will.
Americans deserve to know the details of this scandal. And they
deserve to know them now.

The online version of the article you sent has a link to an article in the
Ft Worth Start-Telegram, The CommonDreams.org article didn't make it clear that rules of the
legislature apparently give the state cops the authority to round up
legislators if they are needed to make a quorum.  Bringing in federal
agencies still crosses the line, and the in-state tactics are questionable.
But the (partisan) reporting in the CommonDreams article leaves the reader
with the impression that it was over the line to be looking for the
legislators at all.

       Eyes of Texas, U.S. on truant legislators
       By Jay Root
       Star-Telegram Austin Bureau
                   STAR-TELEGRAM/RODGER MALLISON
                   Reps. Al Edwards of Houston, Helen Giddings of DeSoto and
Sylvester Turner of Houston talk with reporters in Austin. The three
Democratic representatives returned to the House on Tuesday.
       Wives have been watched. A former House speaker's plane was tracked.
Federal officials have been asked to intervene. Even the El Paso Police
Department has gotten involved.
       The hunt for Democrats on the lam from the Texas Legislature has
involved virtually every level of government, ranging from a house call by
local cops to monitoring conducted -- apparently unwittingly -- by a
California-based agency that normally is involved in the fight against
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.
       By Tuesday night, only one House member, Rep. Helen Giddings,
D-DeSoto, had been apprehended.
       State Rep. Craig Eiland, D-Galveston, said he believes that the
dragnet went overboard when a Texas Ranger tried to find him Monday night at
the neonatal unit of the Galveston hospital where his newborn twins are
recovering -- in intensive care. Eiland said he called the agent on his
cellphone and told him that DPS agents had already found him in Ardmore,
Okla. -- where he and most of his fellow boycotters are in self-imposed
       "It's unnecessary, bordering on harassment," Eiland said. "Let the
good guys go back to catching the bad guys and let the politicians deal with
each other."
       The Texas Department of Public Safety says it's just doing its job:
trying to haul in more than 50 Democrats who skipped town to block a
controversial vote on redistricting.
       Although their tactic isn't a crime, state law enforcement officers
have the authority to arrest members of the Legislature and deliver them to
the Capitol to achieve the necessary quorum. At least three divisions of the
DPS -- state troopers, Texas Rangers and the Special Crimes unit -- are on
the case.

I like the juxtaposition of two of the articles in David Pogue's NYT "Circuits" online column today...
The article is about iris scanners, not retina scanners,

I'd guess that conventional eyeglasses would  interfere with its effectiveness,
because they magnify or shrink the image and may distort it in other ways,

@_subject: using PoW + filters to avoid false positives (Re: Re: A 
Steve Bellovin pointed out that spammers who use open relays and
open proxies will happily burn those CPUs doing proof-of-work
as well as burning their bandwidth multiplying spam.
That's not necessarily a _bad_ thing, if it gets the attention of
the people running the relay/proxy machines (:-)
But it's a basic problem with link-based proof-of-work like START_TLS
as opposed to end-to-end proof-of-work mechanisms in the message itself.
If you do link-based, the pnly last relay site needs to do the work,
so the spammer can steal CPU from lots of machines without burning his own.
If you do message-based proof-of-work, it's much harder to get a proxy
or relay to do the work, as opposed to using the spammer's own machine.
START_TLS and other link-based mechanisms _do_ have the benefit of
harassing dialup and DSL spammers, who are using their own CPUs without relays,
so it at least gets rid of some of the ankle-biters and forces spammers
to abuse relays and proxies, which may be easier to identify
(especially because they're using START_TLS...)
This has the side benefit that it cuts down on the use of dial/dsl blacklists,
which are one of the extremely annoying sources of collateral damage
in the anti-spam world.

If you're thinking about using relay blocking lists,
you'll also need to whitelist them,
because there are some systems like John Gilmore's that get blocked otherwise.
I don't know how many of the remailers show up on blacklists,
but the remailer-operators list periodically notes domains that
get blacklisted as well, so it's non-zero.

This is probably the 10th e-mail message you've received telling you how
you can get rid of junk e-mail messages. But, I found a sweet software
package that you might find a little more useful than all of the other
anti-spam programs you've heard about. The program is called Spam
Sleuth, and it just so happens that Blue Squirrel released an updated
version, 2.0.10, last week.
How does Spam Sleuth defeat spam? The program uses a Point System.
Spam Sleuth has analyzers, and each analyzer: Friends, Spammers,To,
Goodwords, Badwords, Profanity, Subject, Attachments, Charsets, HTML
Volume, etc. looks at an e- mail a different way and assigns points. The
more points an e-mail message receives the more likely it is to be
deemed as spam. The less points an e-mail message receives the more
likely it is a real gem. Think of it as though it was a contest, and
each Analyzer is a different judge, and the messages are the
contestants, and Spam Sleuth is the scorekeeper. Every judge looks at
the e-mail message and assigns points based on specific criteria. Then
all of the points are added together to create an overall total. More
points is bad, and less points is good.
The point system is clever, and works wonderfully, but the heart of Spam
Sleuth has some killer features:
Turing Test: If Spam Sleuth accidentally catches a message as spam, it
lets the sender type some special letters to show that the message
wasn't sent by a mindless machine, and the message is allowed through to
your InBox. (Great way to know if you're dealing with a real human on
the other end.)  This is my favorite because I can be much more
aggressive with my settings without worrying I'll miss an important
E-Mail Stamps: Allows you to charge senders a fee to let an e-mail
message through to your inbox. Spam Sleuth sends an email back to the
sender and requires them to make a payment via PayPal before the program
will allow the message through to your inbox. You configure and decide
how much your time is worth, whether it's 5 cents, or a buck. (That's
right, you make the spammers pay you to send junk e-mail messages.)
Bayesian Analysis: Looks at your previous e-mail and learns the
characteristics of spam and good e-mail. Just like a baby, it needs to
be taught right from wrong. By marking your messages as Good or Spam,
and then Training the Bayesian Analyzer, you can teach it right from
wrong. Then it can contribute to the decision of whether a new e-mail is
spam or not. (Now that's what I call cloning.)
Be sure to check this program out, download a 60 day demo from:
P.S. I hooked you up with a discount. So if you call 800-403-0925 or
visit  you can get a
copy for $19.95 vs. $29.95 normally.

This weekend I received three or more cell phone calls from 800-855-0000,
which said they were the AT&T Relay Service, which relays phone calls
from deaf people using TDD or TTY or now internet webform services.
They claimed to be a "Dr. Charles Ego" (or some name like that)
asking to confirm that I'd received his email, and asking for my email I was a bit puzzled, because none of the deaf people I have known
over the years are doctors, and one of the two signing people
I know well was at dinner with me when the call arrived,
and they were calling like this was a business call,
but it was Sunday night before a US Monday holiday,
so they were probably calling from somewhere that it was Monday daytime.
The name sounded enough like the usual fraudulent Nigerian Email Scam,
so I asked what time zone he was in, and he replied 12:00 GMT,
which didn't make sense (either it's Atlantic Time, or he was just wrong.)
So I poked around the AT&T Relay Service web site,
and it sounds like we've got a new web-based interface to
free telephone relay service and the spammers have discovered
the potential for abusing it.   Sigh.
And it's got a privacy policy that sounds like it'll be
difficult to track down these callers.....
The web site says they deal with privacy issues by not storing call content,
though at first reading it doesn't really say whether they do or don't store
call record information like IP address, phone number, or
call duration, though since it's free that probably means it's
either government-subsidized or some other mandated program with
accounting requirements like that, or if they have an
"except for drugs or terrorism" requirement.

While the phone hardware is EU3500/pair, the Windows software is free -

I'm also interested in the question of whether they've learned some of
the technical lessons that the SpeakFreely project learned
(e.g. NAT, delay accumulation from TCP, tuning for Windows perfomance.)
While this phone isn't Free Software in the RMSically-correct sense
or even the BSD "leave our name on it and don't sue us" sense,
it's at least openly published for inspection, though unless the
programming environment that it supports is very resticted,
the "compile the code and compare the binaries" approach is pretty lame,
since optimizing compilers tend to make it difficult.
Skype is a non-starter from a security perspective -
too many proprietary parts, apparently including codecs,
closed source, documentation written by people who don't understand
cryptographic security beyond the buzzword level on a team that's
small enough that you'd expect that that implies the coders don't either.

it may be an interesting experiment in user interface and architecture,
which somebody else could use with better crypto and policies.

let the user cache some randomly-generated password string with it.
That doesn't protect you against someone stealing the phone,

stolen phone rather than to somebody else's phone.
If your threat model assumes that they can trick your phone into

Especially for domains, it's important to do some validation,
though in the absence of widely-deployed DNSSEC, it's hard to do automatically.
Perhaps 3-way-handshake email to postmaster at example.com or
the whois administrative contact address.
(This also has the side-effect of requiring people to actually use their
postmaster addresses, at least for fifteen minutes or so :-)
And while hashing has the obvious risk of dictionary attacks,
it'll at least cut back on some of the abuses,
especially if the list is dynamic and the spamware vendors who
do the dictionary attacks want to charge lots of money for it.
Also, the scale's a lot more annoying searching a million obvious names
on each of 20 million domains with a hash that takes a second per hit,
though Moore's Law will obviously erode the hash time.
Obviously spammers will target popular mail systems first.
However, there are two special email address forms that complicate this a bit
- tagged addresses - username+tag at example.com
         There are several different syntaxes for this - plusses, dashes, etc.,
         and either you just ignore the problem
         (let the user register  however many tagged addresses they want),
         or else you special-case the rules so that bulk-emailers
         who want to send mail to a plus-tagged address also must
         check the untagged version.
- per-user subdomains - anything at username.example.com
         Technically this is no different than any other per-domain blocking,
         but administratively it's different, because there's no whois record
         and there might not be a postmaster address.
There's a scalability problem that has to be solved,
which is how to prevent a DOS-by-signing-up-too-many-addresses attack.
An example would be a Turing test image on a web page
(which has the downside of preventing automated signups,
as well as annoying blind people), or else requiring a
hashcash puzzle that takes ten times as long as the list's hash function.

I suppose you could do that, though it's probably harder
to coordinate that for subdomains, whose owners are less likely
to be directly managing their DNS records.
You'd probably want to do special cases for large domains
like AOL, etc., where the users have limited gateways to the internet.
You're still vulnerable to DDOS-type attacks by armies of zombies,
though of course they've got lots of other bad things they can do.
Too true.  It's too bad, because you'd only need a couple
hundred million records for the US, and signing up is the

Optical Mark Sense - certainly the way to go if you want to computerize,
except that the manufacturers aren't big Bush Republican donors.
I'm used to mechanical lever machines in Delaware and New Jersey
(which seem to mostly work well except for write-in votes),
plus the punch-card things in California which are boring but workable.
If somebody wanted to do an OMS system that had a fancy touch-screen interface,
you could have the touch-screen machine print the OMS ballot,
and lay out the printed version so it's human-readable,
with a bit of extra assistance like checksums,
plus have a verifier read it to make sure it's correctly machine-readable.
That'd let you have big print for low-sighted people,
voice readout for blind people, randomized order for random people, etc.
Actually, it tends to be 352x288, which is the resolution of
cheap CCD video camera chips.  Some of the early cheap digital cameras
used that, before going to 640x480 (good enough for web pictures)
and then to higher resolutions.
They're mostly starting to do 640x480, but they're somewhat limited
by the low data rates that most of the phones get.
Phones with EDGE or 1xRTT or other higher-speed data rates,
and phones that use Bluetooth to upload to computers,
are set to do more, but otherwise it tends to take too long to transmit
(and remember that for phone-to-phone videos between Japanese teenagers,
which are the market driver, it's the slower phone that counts.)

The answer to both those questions is
extremely dependent on the message formats
(plus whether the public keys are published :-)
PGP's formats may be ugly bit-twiddly stuff,
but they're also highly visible unless you're using the
add-on stealth packages.  Most of the other formats
for expressing bignum data also tell you how big the numbers are
(or use a fixed-length key.)  Some signature algorithms
produce output that's shorter than the public key
(such as 160-bit signatures), but if you can find the
public key you can obviously tell.
But for the second question, why bother?  Use adequately long keys.

@_subject: NSA and ECC parameters 
Sorry if this discussion
"Excessive" implies a cost-benefit analysis -
does anybody know how slow 512-bit ECC calculations are in practice?
If they're similar in speed to 512-bit RSA, it's usually fine;
if they're similar in speed to 15360-bit RSA, that's maybe a bit slow,
but if encryption and decryption are only a bit slower than 2048-bit RSA,
it doesn't usually matter if key generation is slower.
Also, while there are _lots_ of applications where short keys rock,
like James Donald's Crypto Kong signature lines, or dumb smartcards,
512-bit isn't too bad, and there are applications where it's usable
and 4096-bit RSA keys take up too much space (e.g. including any
signed data in a 576-byte TCP/IP packet.)
But more importantly, the algorithms are only starting to be explored.
We've got a few hundred years of understanding about primes and factoring,
and even then the applications of computer technology to factoring
have gotten a big Moore's Law hit since R,S,A,D,H, PRZ, and the Cypherpunks
started messing with them; 384-bit RSA keys have gone the way of Bass-O-Matic.
ECC is a much newer set of theory, especially for the kinds of attacks
cryptographers care about, and it's exposed to risks from
algorithm theory and number-crunching practice.

Skype has been discussed a bit.  The big problems are
- It's a proprietary protocol they're not documenting,
        so there's no way to tell if it would be any good
        if they've implemented it properly, and
- It's not an open-source implementation, so you can't
        inspect it to see if they _have_ implemented it well, and
- The fact that they'd do either one of those things
        doesn't suggest that they're sensitive to cryptographic concerns,
        and therefore suggests that they're likely to have screwed up, and
- They talk about end-to-end encryption but don't mention key exchange
        or user authentication, which says that at least their
        documentation and PR folks don't have a clue, and
- The fact that they're using proprietary protocols says that they
        won't have an easy time finding commercial off-the-shelf equipment
        to build gateways to the public network, so they'll be less useful,
        and other people won't be able to develop cooperative products,
        unlike all the SIP and H.323 periphery that people are developing,

@_subject: Q: Has a change taken place in factoring RSA keys? 
I think that's the source as well - when the most recent of the
TWINKLE and TWIRL papers came out, Lucky Green was talking about
whether it was still safe to use 1024-bit keys,
and $1B for 1 key/day is similar to Shamir & Tromer's estimate of
            (  )
$20M upfront plus $10M for a 1 key/year capacity.
     (The alternative is that it's people believing the usual FUD sources,
     whether they're the pro-government serious FUD sources or the
     fun-yanking-people's-chains clueless FUDsters.)
But if 1024-bit keys are too weak, RSA is still near-exponential,
and 2048-bit keys are roughly 2**100 times harder to crack than 1024-bit,
vs. 4-8 times as slow to use.  4096 is a lot harder than that;
even if you allow for Moore's law and medium mathematical breakthroughs,
you're still not going to fit a 4096-bit cracker on the planet.
Basically, by the time you're interesting enough for them to spend
$10M and a year to crack your machine, you'd better be using 2048-bit keys
for tactical applications and maybe 4096-bit for long-term military secrets,
and since they're targeting YOU, it's a lot cheaper for them to
black-bag your PC or plant cameras in your ceiling or bribe your janitor.
Large random numbers aren't that hard if you're using them for
long-term signature keys, as opposed to DH or symmetric session keys;
it just takes a bit longer to generate the bits.
Also, once you're up above the 1024-bit range, incremental quality is
less important, because attacks on the keyspace are hard to combine
with factoring attacks on the keys, especially if you're whitening them.
But as you say, taking GPG from 4kbit to 8kbit keys doesn't matter,
because it's no longer close to the weakest link by then.

Steve - The whole thing is a crock, and the problems aren't technical.
None of the proposed users of the system have any desire to use it,
except perhaps as a front for other activities,
and the people who'd want them to make them use it are just meddlers.
It's funny how any time you bring up the First Amendment
in the context of tobacco advertising or internet pornography,
they say "Oh, no, it's not about that, it's about *political* speech",
but if you bring it up in the context of actual political speech,
well then, oh, no, the First Amendment is about not arresting
ranters on soapboxes in the park, or letting people print newspapers
as long as there's official identifying information about the printer,
but it's *certainly* not about actually letting people fund *electoral*
speech, because elections are *way* too important to let unapproved
members of the *public* influence the outcomes....
The couple of papers that Michael Froomkin referenced are
pretty much the canonical references to the approach you're talking about,
but just because there are academics proposing it doesn't mean
it isn't still a total crock.
Now, if you're talking about *real* campaign finance reform,
as in permitting people to engage in free speech even if it requires
money to transmit that speech to their intended recipients,
fully anonymous digital cash is useful for that, in the obvious ways,
and payer-anonymous payee-disclosing digital cash has its uses as well,
if you like to be able to trace the people you're paying,
and anonymous and pseudonymous publishing are also obviously useful,
and then of course there's Blacknet if you want the real info on candidates.
You don't need 100% technical guarantees of anonymity for most political work; the public can usually guess that "Paid for by Californians for Motherhood and Apple Pie" is probably the prison guards' union, or the major opponent of the candidate that the negative TV ad was about, or whatever,
but unless there's a lawsuit or actual investigative reporter, nobody's going to bother tracking them down.

But if you're ignoring jury conscription notices at times that

But yes, otherwise, whatever it was that Tim forgot about, no, I don't remember that stuff, unless they ask really precise questions during voir dire.
The last time I was in the potential-jurors pool, it was a case I'd have been tossed out of instantly during voir dire if they'd gotten to me (they went through about 50-60 people, and I was about  on the list.)
The prosecutor was making sure that all of the potential jurors understood that police never lied, and that just because the accused was a 5-foot-tall 90-pound quiet-looking woman didn't mean that she couldn't have interfered with a cop during a family dispute situation, and I'd have had to answer the question about whether I'd been arrested for or convicted of a crime with something like "Well, the police agreed to drop the charges of interfering with an officer in return for me agreeing not to sue them"; the defense lawyer might not have liked me either :-)

That's overkill.  If this thing is ever actually deployed,
it'll be a feature that _asks_ a Safe-Haven-equipped camera phone
not to take pictures here, and if you happen to have that kind
of phone, it won't take pictures there.
The solution to this is not to carry a special jammer device
if you want to take pictures where people don't want it -
it's to carry a digital camera (and besides, those get
much better pictures - the one gsm cameraphone I've tried had
only a 352x288 CCD in it, in spite of not being a cheap phone.)
Alternatively, if you want to transmit pictures there as well as
taking them, buy a phone now that doesn't have that feature,
or buy a PDA with a camera and some kind of wireless card.
Aside from places that want to protect privacy or prudishness,
one obvious market for Safe Haven is police agencies that
want to be able to bash people without being on live video.
On the other hand, they'd probably be just as happy with a
cell phone jammer, which also prevents live voice transmission,
and therefore not only blocks strategic remote recordkeepers,
but also blocks tactical coordination by a crowd's instigators.

Has there been any security analysis of the effects of putting a

Mozilla listed in the collection of browsers the Javascript was

What are the security implications of the wildcard servers
getting compromised or DDOSed?  In the past,
if my browser or email tried to go to nonexistent-example.com,
it'd get a reject from my system's DNS resolver and fail;
now it starts up a TCP connection to your machines,

The core of the current Internet routing architecture in the US
is a couple of dozen "Tier 1" providers who almost all interconnect with each other,
with each pair almost always connected in more than two places
(usually an East Coast and a West Coast location plus others.)
- Most of the Tier 2 providers are connected to at least two upstreams,
either both Tier 1 or a Tier 1 and a Tier 2.
- There's no well-defined boundary between Tier 2 and Tier 3,
but the Tier 3 types of folks may not be as diverse.
- Some big hosting companies are owned by Tier 1 carriers,
and may just get connectivity from their parent company,
but it usually still has physically diverse connections to diverse switches.
- Many other hosting companies are independent of the carriers,
and tend to have feeds from multiple carriers (usually multiple Tier 1
for the big players).
- Many big end-user companies have multiple large internet feeds
from multiple carriers; even small companies with a couple of T1s
often try to get some diversity (in which case the ISP run by the
local telco is often one of their providers.)
- If you want physically diverse access to your building,
you usually need to buy at least a couple of T3s -
some local telcos will still do diverse T1 access, but most don't,
or else they have it in their tariff rate but *your* street doesn't have it.
As Jim and others have said, it's extremely not tree-like -
we want to maximize the number of careless drunken backhoe drivers
it takes to take down our circuits, as well as maximizing the
number of equipment failures and operator mistakes it takes,
and trying to minimize the damage any problem causes.
DNS's namespace is tree-like, but the actual implementation of the
DNS name server networks is very forested and meshy.

had enough horsepower to run disk compression in the CPU,
and CPU speed has increased a lot faster than disk throughput since then.)
Build the system with an inactivity timeout for /home if you want.
Swap space has the advantage that it doesn't need to preserve
state across system reboots, so you can run an encrypted swap
partition that generates a random key at boot time.
If you want to get fancy about rubber-hose prevention
and avoid the except-for-terrorism clause in the 5th amendment,
you could do something with secret-sharing with your
unindicted co-conspirators (oh, wait, they don't bother with
indictments these days, do they?) so that all of you
need to cooperate in a challenge-response thing
to restart some of the services.
Or you could hide that little 802.11 widget on the shelf
that stores one of the keyfiles you need to
access the secure drive.  Once UWB's widely available,
it'll be better for that (lower power - harder to detect.)
Just make sure that your system _is_ restartable after
power failures, because those are a much more likely event
than cop invasions.

Iowa's deploying cell-phone location-trackers for 911,
and for whatever other purposes the cellphones support.
Des Moines, IA
New technology will allow better response to 911 cell callers
08/09/04 10:35 AM
DES MOINES, IOWA (AP) -- Cell phone users in Iowa are getting a 911 upgrade.
The state is among the first in the nation to use the new technology that will help dispatchers pinpoint the emergency caller.
Iowa 911 Program Manager John Benson says it's already being tested in Des Moines, and the end of the year, about half of the state's 125 dispatch centers will have the upgrade.
About half of Iowa's 911 calls are placed by cell phones. That's about 50,000 a month.
Current technology allows dispatchers to locate a cell phone 911 caller by the nearest cell tower, often miles away. The new global-positioning technology provides the latitude and longitude of the caller, which can be electronically displayed on a map.

From Bill Scannell :
On the 16th of August 2004, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals begins work on
the Gilmore vs. Ashcroft case.  At stake is nothing less than the right of
Americans to travel freely in their own country -- and the exposure of
'secret law' for what it is: an abomination.
The man who is fighting the good fight is named John Gilmore.  John made his
fortune as a programmer and entrepreneur in the software industry.  Whereas
most people in his position would have moved to a tropical island and lived
a life of luxury, John chose to use his wealth to protect and defend the US
On the 4th of July 2002, John Gilmore, American citizen, decided to take a
trip from one part of the United States of America to another.  At the
airport, he was told he had to produce his ID if he wanted to travel.  He
asked to see the law demanding he show his 'papers' and was told after a
time that the law was secret and no, he wouldn't be allowed to read it.
He hasn't flown in has own country since.
Can you put this out on wide-scan...it's important.

Liechtenstein Prince Hands Power to Son
Aug 15, 6:26 PM (ET)
By HARRY ROSENBAUM
(AP) Prince Alois and Prince Hans-Adam II, right, of Liechtenstein toast each other in the park...
VADUZ, Liechtenstein (AP) - Prince Hans-Adam II formally handed over day-to-day governing powers to his son Crown Prince Alois on Sunday - and then invited all 33,000 of Liechtenstein's people to a garden party.
Hans-Adam, 59, retains overall authority over Liechtenstein, the tiny nation - one of Europe's smallest - wedged between Austria and Switzerland.
After an open-air Mass, Alois gave his first speech as head of state.
"Many people might ask ... 'Why should we change something that's working so well?'" said Alois, 36.
But the country, which owes much of its wealth to being a financial center in the heart of Europe, is under pressure to crack down on global money laundering, he said.
"The crisis in the financial center as well as the crisis in many European states show us how dangerous it can be if necessary, but perhaps unpleasant, reforms are not tackled promptly," Alois said. Like Switzerland, Liechtenstein has kept itself apart from Europe, remaining neutral in World War II and staying out of the European Union.
Under constitutional changes made last year, the powers delegated to Alois include dismissing governments, vetoing new laws and casting the deciding vote on naming judges.
The electorate has some checks on royal prerogative - it can force a referendum on any issue by gathering at least 1,500 signatures. But the Council of Europe, the continent's top human rights watchdog, has called last year's constitutional changes "a serious step backward" and says it is monitoring Liechtenstein's commitment to democracy because the prince has acquired such extensive powers.
"Hans-Adam has been a provocateur," says Mario Frick, a former prime minister who opposed the prince's constitutional changes. "He liked to be in the middle of a quarrel. Many people hope Prince Alois ... will want to calm things down."
Alois' spokeswoman Edith Schaedler told The Associated Press there were no plans to change Liechtenstein's foreign policy.
"Prince Alois will focus initially more on internal affairs ... to secure pensions and health care for the long-term, and to ensure the best possible education," she said.
The handover took place on the national holiday, celebrating Hans-Adam's father and coinciding with the Catholic feast of the Assumption.

There are several different issues related to PROMIS
0 - What size tinfoil hat do you need?
         (It's probably still worth being paranoid about Echelon,
         but PROMIS is old hat...)
1 - Feds or somebody basically pirated their copy of the software,
         back when most mainframe software was expensive,
         and drove the company into bankruptcy rather than pay up,
         and they spent a lot of effort covering up their ripoff,
         possibly including the murder of a journalist.
2 - What are the basic capabilities of the software?
         I think Alif's got it about right, and remember that
         back in the early 80s, Codd & Date had written some really cool
         theory about how relational databases could and should work,
         but most computers didn't have the horsepower for them and
         the early implementations were mostly either crude or bloated.
         Also, mainframe software tended to be very customized,
         particularly if it had to interconnect with other mainframe software
         like somebody else's non-relational database with a different schema.
3 - What sets of data were the various spooks, feds, and staties
         _keeping_ in their databases, and how much of it did they
         share with each other or get from various other sources?
If you worked with databases back in the early 80s, remember that
a gigabyte of disk used to be pretty big, rather than wristwatch-sized,
and a megabyte of RAM was big and cost non-trivial amounts of money,
and magnetic tapes held less than 200MB and took tens of minutes to read,
and big database projects typically required departments of
dozens or hundreds of workers to spend months of budgeting and planning to
design schemas and processes that could take months to run,
instead of being ad-hoc queries any random employee can run on their desktop
over lunchtime if they feel like it, and might be able to run
on their pocket computer when riding home on the subway.
My department's ~1983 VAX had a 1 MIPS CPU, a gig of removable disk,
4MB RAM, and two tape drives, and cost about $400K.
It wasn't big iron - that was typically an order of magnitude bigger.
These days, $400 will get you a 3000 MIPS CPU, a gig of RAM,
and 100-200GB disk, and database software is free.
It's about a million times more cost-effective, depending on
whether you care more about CPU, disk, or RAM,
and there's an Internet hanging out the back side that will
let you use Google's farm of ~100K computers for free.

High-school drop-out to become Homeland Security Czar
By Thomas C Greene
Published Monday 6th December 2004 11:07 GMT
President George W. Bush has nominated former New York City Police
Commissioner Bernard Kerik to replace Tom Ridge as Homeland Security
Secretary, marking a significant departure from his tendency to choose
educated, Patrician types for his Cabinet.
Kerik, a high-school drop-out abandoned at age four by his prostitute
mother in the gritty town of Patterson, New Jersey, served as an Army MP in
South Korea, and later worked in private international security rackets,
most interestingly in Saudi Arabia.
He joined the New York City Police Department in 1985. He followed that
with a stint as Warden of the Passaic County Jail in New Jersey, and became
the Training Officer and Commander of the Special Weapons and Operations
Units. In 1998 he was named New York Corrections Commissioner, and
established an ironclad, head-cracking discipline in the City's notorious
detention facilities.
A favorite of former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Kerik had the honor
of seeing the Manhattan Detention Complex, known to locals as "the Tombs,"
re-named the Bernard B. Kerik Complex by then-mayor Giuliani. Kerik left a
minor cloud of corruption behind, with allegations that one of his
lieutenants used correctional staff to work illegally in Republican
In 2000, Giuliani named Kerik Police Commissioner, to assist him in a vast
anti-crime crackdown, where the chief tactic was for police to pounce
aggressively on even the most chickenshit offences, such as spitting on the
Upon his retirement from City politics, Giuliani decided to cash in on
post-9/11 security hysteria by founding his own security outfit, Giuliani
Partners LLC. Kerik has served as senior vice president at Giuliani
Partners, and CEO of Giuliani-Kerik LLC, a vendor of law-enforcement
"performance systems". Meanwhile, Giuliani has founded several spin-offs,
such as Giuliani Capital Advisors LLC, and the Rudolph W. Giuliani Advanced
Security Centers (ASC), a cyber-security outfit formed in connection with
Ernst & Young.
Recently, Kerik shipped out to Iraq to train the local policemen who are
routinely blown to pieces by insurgents and terrorists. There, he enjoyed
the snappy titles of Interim Minister of the Interior, and Senior Policy
Advisor to the US Presidential Envoy to Iraq's Coalition Provisional
Authority. Kerik lasted only four months, and the Iraqi police are still as
incompetent, weak, and corrupt as when he arrived in country.
Kerik began making his transition from local to national politics by
campaigning for President Bush's re-election, alongside his political
patron and business partner, Rudy Giuliani. Kerik has been a devoted
booster of the so-called Patriot Act, having given several speeches in its
support while campaigning for Bush.
In anticipation of his rise to national office, Kerik recently sold his
$5.8m in shares of Taser International, makers of absolutely safe police
stun guns that are now routinely used against old women and children.
He is expected to be confirmed by the Senate without difficulty. .

If you're a literary-crit type, interested in the evolution of
Nietzsche's thought, that's an interesting kind of question,
and you can go looking for evidence in the changes in
ideas and expression between his earlier and later books.
However, if you're trying to examine the question of
whether his books should be taken seriously
as philosophy, as opposed to whether they're
Significant Art, then that doesn't really matter;
the question is whether the ideas as written
are any good or are crackpot lunacy,
which is independent of whether the author was a crackpot.
I suppose if you're trying to evaluate whether
they're a good philosophy for actual living,
you can look at the effects of Nietzsche's
ideas on his life, but that's a much broader study,
and the direct lesson here is that
unsafe sex isn't a good idea..
Disclaimer - most of what I've read of Nietzsche was
when we had to translate some of it in high school German class.
It's very frustrating to be reading something that
appears to say that the destruction of the human race
would be a good thing and have to figure out if that's
because you got a verb tense wrong or because it's Nietzsche.

INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST WROTE CONTROVERSIAL SERIES
By Jessica Portner
Mercury News
Gary Webb, a former Mercury News investigative reporter, author and legislative staffer who ignited a firestorm with his controversial stories, died Friday in an apparent suicide in his suburban Sacramento home. He was 49.
The Sacramento County coroner's office said that when A Better Moving Company arrived at Mr. Webb's Carmichael home at about 8:20 a.m. Friday, a worker discovered a note posted to the front door which read: ``Please do not enter. Call 911 and ask for an ambulance.''
Mr. Webb, an award-winning journalist, was found dead of a gunshot wound to the head, Sacramento County Deputy Coroner Bill Guillot said Saturday.
Mr. Webb's friends and colleagues described him as a devoted father and a funny, dogged reporter who was passionate about investigative journalism.
As a staff writer for the Mercury News from 1989 to 1997, he exposed freeway retrofitting problems in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and wrote stories about the Department of Motor Vehicles' computer software fiascos.
Mr. Webb was perhaps best known for sparking a national controversy with a 1996 story that contended supporters of a CIA-backed guerrilla army in Nicaragua helped trigger America's crack-cocaine epidemic in the 1980s. The ``Dark Alliance'' series in the Mercury News came under fire by other news organizations, and the paper's own investigation concluded the series did not meet its standards.
Mr. Webb resigned a year and a half after the series appeared in the paper. He then published his book, ``Dark Alliance: The CIA, the Contras and the Crack Cocaine Explosion.''
In the past few years, Mr. Webb worked in the California Assembly Speaker's Office of Member Services and for the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. The committee investigated charges that Oracle received a no-bid contract from Gov. Gray Davis. After being laid off from his legislative post last year, Mr. Webb was hired by the Sacramento News and Review, a weekly Tom Dresslar, a spokesman for state Attorney General Bill Lockyer who has known Mr. Webb for more than a decade, was distraught Saturday when he heard that his friend may have taken his own life.
``He had a fierce commitment to justice, truth and cared a lot about people who are forgotten and society tries to shove into the dark corners,'' Dresslar said. ``It's a big loss for me personally and a great loss for the journalism community.''
Services for Mr. Webb are pending.

Working Together: Conference on Public/Private R&D Partnerships in Homeland
Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Science & Technology
         April 27 & 28, 2005
         The Seaport Hotel and World Trade Center
         Boston, Massachusetts, USA
Call for Technical Papers
The First Annual Working Together: Conference on Public/Private Research &
Development (R&D) Partnerships in Homeland Security
This two-day Conference will focus on state-of-the-art science and
technology to anticipate, prevent, respond to, and recover from
high-consequence chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, explosives
and cyber terrorist threats. The conference will also address protection of
the nation's critical infrastructure, and the harnessing of science and
intelligence to reduce threat and risk.
The objectives of this inaugural event are to encourage public-private
partnering among scientists and engineers from government, national
laboratories, universities and research institutes, and private sector
firms investing in R&D, to address the collective science and technology
research goals of the U.S. homeland security community. Private sector and
university-based scientists can benefit from the technologies and technical
approaches developed and deployed by the national and DHS labs.  The
laboratories in turn can explore leveraging opportunities with leading
private sector and university-based research programs.
Through plenary and breakout sessions, posters and a companion Exhibition
Conference Participants will:
7  learn about DHS awareness, countermeasures and response and recovery
7  address the most pressing technical challenges;
7  identify the most critical knowledge gaps;
7  be introduced to the core capabilities of national and DHS laboratories,
and the Departments university-based homeland security centers; and
DHS is committed to science and technology leadership, and the creation of
an enduring national capability for homeland security.  Toward this end,
the DHS S&T Directorate supports and recognizes technical excellence in
research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT&E) of homeland security
technologies; encourages collaborations and partnerships among RDT&E
performers across the homeland security science and technology complex;
actively disseminates knowledge generated through the execution of RDT&E
programs and university-based homeland security centers; and to the
greatest extent practical, enhances visibility and recognition of
scientists and engineers dedicated to homeland security missions.
Technical Topics
We are seeking papers on the following topics:
7  Threat Characterization for:  Chemical, Biological, Radiological /
Nuclear, Conventional Explosives (CBRNE)
7  Threat and Vulnerability Assessment including:  Knowledge Discovery

@_subject: Indian Govt bans pre-paid cell because of "separatists" 
The Indian government has banned the sale of pre-paid cash cards for cell
phones in the northeastern states of Assam and Meghalaya, allegedly
because separatists have bought lots of them for hard-to-trace
communications.  Reliance Telephone, who runs cell service in those areas,
didn't feel they had a choice about complying.  (If it were VSNL, the
former telecom monopoly, that'd be no surprise, but Reliance is a big
competitor.)  Consumer groups are extremely upset and vocal (at least
until their current phone cards run out, at which point they'll become
much quieter...)  We'll see how long Bogus Homeland Security can override
consumers and smugglers.-- Bill Stewart bill.stewart at pobox.com

@_subject: Cypherpunks response to viral stimuli 
Five or ten years ago, when the Feds were still pretending to be in
control of crypto, crypto enthusiasts were still a threat - these days you
can pick up VPN boxes at the grocery store, and if they still care about
us, they're more likely to be interested in content and the identities of
active posters than in the identity of lurkers.   They can observe a lot
just by looking, or they can announce a sale on tinfoil hats and see who
responds, or ask a Stupid Newbie Question and see who flames them, or
forge a message about Guns from a Usual Suspect and see who claims that
theirs is bigger, or post about something tangential like how to stop spam
(which has pretty much replaced libertarianism and censorship as the
all-consuming discussion topic on the net.)
Viruses and Web Bugs are less likely to be useful for detecting
Cypherpunks (or Mac users, or Linux users) than for detecting the general
public - to some  extent we may be smarter about that, or at least
grumpier about HTML mail, plus some of the cpunks nodes filter out that
sort of thing.  But perhaps they're exploiting that stack overflow bug in
PGP 2.6.2 instead.

@_subject: [IP] more on  more on E-mail intercept ruling - good   
While Peter Swire is a much better judge of court behavior than I am (:-)
the key issue in the Councilman case is that the Wiretap Law
differentiates between "aural" communications on wires and
the broader category of "electronic communications",
and "electronic communications" might only be protected on wires,
and not just when it's in storage or in transit on a computer.
(What about wireless transmission?  Is that protected?)
If courts don't think VOIP is "aural", they're way out of line.
That should mean that if you wiretap VOIP calls, you'd better have a warrant.
On a more negative hand, it sounds like the court thinks that
wiretap rules only apply to stuff that's on wire -
do packets that are inside a router get protected,
while it's busy thinking about what wire to put it on next?
Does it matter whether you're intercepting the whole message,
or is the fact that the packet you're intercepting is inside a router
good enough for the court, even though the other packets in the message
might still be on the wires into or out of the router?
The Ashcroftians have been able to con Congress into letting
them have lots of other things they ask for in the name of
"preventing technological change from taking away our current powers",
and every edge case seems to be used as a loophole to grant them
more power, not to restrict what they've got.
It's possible that a Kerry Administration would be less aggressive
about this than the Bush Administration, though it's unlikely
that they'd actually be much better than the Clinton Administration,
would were pretty evil back in their day.
Oh, they know, and they're in a mad scramble to make sure that
they can tap data communications as well, and most VOIP
doesn't have useful crypto protection.  So far, it's easier
to tap VOIP calls after they've been turned back into telco-flavored TDM,
but that's partly because they've got tools and practice and
established procedures for doing so.  The big difference with VOIP
is that it's normal to design relatively distributed VOIP systems
that do most of the work peer-to-peer, and it's harder to get a hook
into the endpoints without the endpoints being aware of them.
Some VOIP systems can probably be convinced to make three-way calls
without telling the user interface at the endpoints,
so the logical way to do wiretapping is to get the gatekeepers
to build calls that way.

@_subject: Tyler's Education  
As far as education goes, if you're constantly seeing black vans
with big funky antennas on them parked in front of your house
any time you're on the computer, you've really got far more serious
worries than just a bit of TEMPEST.  It's either time to line up
your lawyers because of stuff you do know you've been doing,
or else time to get your shrink to up your meds a bit.
It's been 15-20 years since I worked on TEMPEST environments,
so technology has overtaken most of what we were doing.
We tested the TEMPEST room at 450 MHz, and needed something like
100-120 dB of shielding to be comfortable with it,
and at those frequencies, you'd easily find leakage if the
copper-wool packing in the joints wasn't tight.
Our VAX ran at something like 10 MHz, and our Sparcstations
might have been as fast as 40 MHz, but basically there wasn't
a lot of high-frequency signal out there, even with harmonics.
The standards for cable penetration were that a waveguide hole
needed to be N wavelengths deep and no more than 1/x wide
(I think it was something like half-wave wide), and most of ours
were an inch or two deep with quarter-inch holes.
That was convenient for running fiber through.
If you stuck a paper-clip about halfway through, the RF meter would peg.
These days, of course, most of the equipment's at much higher frequencies;
I doubt the room would be meaningfully tight with 5GHz machines.
Power connections were filtered, which was much more expensive,
using boxes with big inductors in them.
That part of the job would be much easier today -
the VAX needed three-phase power, and the room drew lots of amps,
as did the two one-ton water-cooled Liebert air conditioners.
That AMD 64-bit CPU might look like a space-heater,
but it really isn't that bad.  And a laptop's a lot better.
We occasionally used TEMPEST-shielded PCs.  They weren't bad -
they had solid metal boxes, and special shielded cables for the
rather heavy keyboards, and the monitors were a bit bulky.
The monitors were mostly CGA or mono text - maybe some EGA,
but basically they were a lot lower end that you'd want today.
Don't expect that laptops will keep you out of trouble -
I once had a laptop projecting its image onto a TV I was near.
The image was out of sync, with three partial images,
and it was probably in the 640x480 days, maybe 800x600, ~1997,
but I'd done nothing special and it was an average TV.
Probably the signal was leaking out the VGA jack on the laptop.
The easy part of TEMPEST monitoring is finding some signal.
The hard part is sorting it out from the noise.
If they're not nearby, they're unlikely to be using TEMPEST on you;
they're much more likely to be tapping your ISP connections.

@_subject: UBL is George Washington 
Somebody wrote
 > WTC doesn't make sense as a target
Everybody I knew was _much_ more upset about the WTC than the Pentagon.
As one friend put it "I don't care about the Pentagon."
Now, partly that's because of the shock of the buildings collapsing,
which seemed much more dramatic than the Pentagon getting an edge dented.
And it's partly because 3000 people died, and 30,000 _could_ have died,
but a lot of it's because attacking New York City is attacking
American society, which was tremendously damaging to morale,
while attacking the Pentagon is attacking the military,
who spend their time attacking other people so all's fair.
And the Feds planting anthrax in the Senate building and other places
to keep us even more scared about terrorism so we'd be obedient
really did make things worse.
The effects on American business were dramatic, but for the
telecommunications industry the big problems weren't the COs,
they were the year-long disappearance of the travel industry
(which uses huge amounts of high-value call center calls)
and the general decline in the economy, and trashing business in Wall Street,
plus it was kicking us while were were down because the
dot-com crash and the related crash in the telecom industry
were already going on.
The loss of the CO capacity was somewhat balanced by the
fact that nobody was allowed anywhere near that area to work.
The Verizon CO was much more of a problem than the AT&T one,
partly because it had lots of access lines, while we mostly had
a smaller number of larger trunks that are easier to reroute,
plus fiber access rings which were mostly diverse,
plus all the now-dead access lines from the Verizon POP.
Industry did respond with a huge amount of diversification -
taking out a CO today would cause much less damage,
plus the huge increase in telecommuting means that offices are
usually a less critical resource.
Do you mean the building that looks like antique furniture?
That's just office space, and I think we'd sold it by then.
Or does one of the actual POPs have old microwave dishes on the roof?
Sigh.  We've sold off AT&T Wireless as a business and still nobody realizes I think they were still relatively popular back then,
though they had real problems around New York City keeping
up with rapidly-growing demand.  But yeah, the best thing about them
these days is that Cingular's buying them, so my stock has
zoomed up to almost half what I paid for it instead of 10-20%.

@_subject: Email tapping by ISPs, forwarder addresses, and crypto   
They're also marketed as permanent addresses you can keep when
you change ISPs, for example pobox.com was one of the first ones.
Unfortunately, as far as I know, none of the forwarders let you
forward mail from recipient+tag at forwarder.com to recipient+tag at currentISP.com,
which means that they don't support tag-based spam protection.
When I want disposable addresses, I either use free providers,
or I use tagged addresses at free / cheap providers like fastmail.fm.
Councilman currently only affects the First Circuit (the Northeast),
and it was only the three-judge-panel version of the Appeals Court,
so he could appeal it to the full court before going to the Supremes.
My reading of the opinions is that the two majority judges totally
failed to grasp the technology, while the dissenting judge got it,
so even if the opinion stands, it's very narrow in scope -
but it's a strong reminder that the current laws don't protect
stored email very well, and that if judges aren't technical enough
to understand it when it's laid out in front of their faces,
they're certainly not going to be sufficiently uncooperative
when police try to get warrants or subpoenas (or at least it
probably won't be hard for police to find a cooperative judge.)
Also, in the Steve Jackson Games case, the courts and Feds got away
with declaring that the ECPA didn't apply to mail that had arrived
in mailboxes, only to mail that was in transit.
It's not clear that ISPs in general can read mail without any
notice or liability - just that the obvious readings of the law
that Councilman sued them under don't currently work in the 1st Circuit.
He might have tried various business-related torts successfully,
but the wiretapping laws looked like a slam-dunk.
But that doesn't usually work against police, just businesses.
Police reading mail like this really is a different case -
they either need some kind of court papers to hand the ISP
(though these days the Patriot Act seems to be used to justify
almost anything and place a gag order on the activity,
and a subpoena is easier to get than a warrant),
or they need some bogus justification that the ISP has to
obey "administrative requests" that aren't court-issued,
or they need to wiretap the bits legally.
One scary thing about Councilman was that it happened in a case
where the government was vaguely neutral and responsible for protecting
the citizen's privacy - when the prosecutors are _trying_ to get
outrageously twisted anti-privacy rulings they're more likely to win.
In particular, does a message count as "in transit" if you're
only hauling IP packets around with parts of the message
rather than the whole message, or does each part count as "in storage"
when it's gotten to a router that has to queue it before
forwarding it on to the next hop?  Or if the whole message
is queued in your ISP's sendmail queue because you've got an MX there?
What about _outgoing_ mail queued at your ISP,
who's being a good anti-spammer and forcing you to use
their mail transfer agent instead of sending directly to the destination?
There are several different threat models to think about -
- Greedy ISP reading your mail for their own purposes
- ISP responding to court-ordered wiretapping
- ISP collaborating enthusiastically with police
- Police wiretapping without court orders
- All of the above, but for stored mailboxes, not in-transit
- All of the above, but for traffic analysis / headers, not content
Mail-handling services don't prevent any of the in-transit threats,
but they can eliminate most of the threats to stored mailboxes,
and they do let you move your vulnerability to a different jurisdiction,
which can potentially reduce the likelihood that they'll wiretap you there.
For instance, if you're using your local cable modem company
for mailbox services, and you annoy your local police,
they may try to tap you, but police in Anguilla will probably
only try to tap you if you've gotten the US Feds or MI5/MI6 annoyed.
Police in Sealand might not respond to wiretaps at all,
but any unencrypted mail going there would have been watched closely.
Spooks in the UK proper might wiretap you as a favor to the US spooks,
and data privacy laws might or might not apply if you're a non-subject.
Google's Gmail is an interesting case.
Unlike Councilman's ISP, who were sneaky greedy wiretapping bums,
Google tells you that they'll grep your mail for advertising material,
and tells you how much of that they'll leak to the advertisers
and makes you some promises not to leak more.
The data's just sitting there waiting for a subpoena,
and there's not much point in having it all encrypted because
the cool features of Gmail aren't much use on cyphertext.
STARTTLS is helpful because it can protect mail from the sender's ISP.
Almost by definition, that's unencrypted mail, because otherwise
you wouldn't be so worried about it getting tapped.
It might.  Unless of course the service is really run by narcs.

@_subject: USA PATRIOT Act Survives Amendment Attempt (fwd from    
The obvious method for the first half of your problem is
Shamir secret-sharing - n out of m people need to provide
their information in order to access the data item (or its key.)
That isn't necessarily an _efficient_ protocol for databases,
of course, but where you have something where it works, it works.
And obviously you'd want some jurisdictional arbitrage.
I'm not convinced that the second half of your problem makes sense.
The only ways to make sure that somebody knows something are either to
tell them or else to get them to tell you some piece of information you need.
Since it's the secret police that would be running the algorithm,
they're not going to be polite about telling them if they don't need to,
so you're dependent on some algorithm that requires their assistance,
which is in some sense consent.  I suppose you could differentiate
assistance and consent contractually, by telling them it's ok to release
the data when given papers from some appropriate court,
and you could probably even require them to notify you,
e.g. by having them charge a per-event fee for their service,
and maybe that'll hold up in jurisdictions where their secret police
don't cooperate well with your secret police.
Of course, even to use this requires that the application be designed
in some manner where there's some kind of key that's needed
to access the data, such as a mailbox that encrypts incoming mail
with your public key.  That doesn't prevent the secret police from
forcing your mailbox company to reveal the information before
encrypting it to you, but it does at least protect _old_ mail,
unless n out of the m key escrow agents all cooperate.
I don't know why you'd design a system like this when you could
do it without the key escrow feature - am I missing something?

@_subject: Secure telephones 
If you're trying to build a usable cellphone,
you've got much more stringent design criteria than a deskphone.
You've got packaging requirements that force you into
serious industrial design if you want something pocket-sized
with good battery life, plus you've got to implement all the
cellular interface features.
If you're willing to build a backpack-phone, that's a lot simpler,
because you can use a laptop with a
[pick-your-favorite-cellular-data-standard] card
and either a wired headset or a Bluetooth frob for a BT headset.
An intermediate design, which other people have done,
is an 802.11 phone - take your favorite high-end multimedia PDA
and an 802.11 card and write whatever UI you want.
Again, you can either do a wire to your pocket or Bluetooth,
or do what some of the early Compaq Ipaq phones did and just
hold the thing up to your cheek.
I'm not aware of any cellular data cards in PDA-usable format
(unless you've got a PDA big enough for PCMCIA),
but you could take a GSM etc. phone with a wired interface to a PDA.
The fun UI to implement is an all-audio one, with speech recognition
for commands.  There's a lot of market space out there for that.
Bluetooth headsets aren't necessarily a great match for it,
because you're getting a low bit-rate signal from a cheap microphone,
as opposed to 11kHz 16-bit audio sampling.

I think you're talking at cross-purposes.
If you're the Good Guy, trying to keep from being wiretapped,
you need to assume that the Bad Guys are going to get everything,
or at least everything of _yours_.
If you're the Wiretapper, trying to figure out how to get everything,
it's still difficult and expensive and annoying,
and much easier to just administrative-subpoena-gag-order the ISP,
limiting the number of people at the ISP who know anything.
 > > Tape Drives
 > How will you do _that_ quietly?
You don't put the tape drives on ISP premises, you put the extra
fiber connections to the Homeland Security Office there,
and put the tape drives somewhere convenient -
or if the ISP also runs a colo center, you put them there
in a cage rented by the Maryland Procurement Agency or something.
 > OC192s full of ATM and T1s and T3s, oh my!
Most ISPs can roughly be divided into the
access-side connections (lots of small circuits out to end users),
backbones (fat pipes to your other POPs and other ISPs),
and processing/hosting/etc. equipment.
Wiretapping the backbone doesn't get you everything,
but it's a small number of fat pipes, and you don't need to go
tracking and demuxing all the thousands of little access circuits
or demodulating the modems or whatever - just get the good stuff,
where it's all been routed together on a fat IP channel
(possibly running MPLS, but that's just a few extra headers.)
If an ISP is buying an access ring from an access ring provider,
you can subpoena _that_ provider to find out which channels or
wavelengths are probably the ones you want and do a passive tap there.
 > Tapping fibers under the ocean.
Most big US ISP backbones these days run OC48 or OC192
between bigger cities; connections to small cities vary a lot
depending on concentrator-deployment philosophies.
The OC48 and OC192 are usually wavelengths on big DWDM pipes,
though in concentrated areas like New York to Boston you'll
see a certain amount of large bundles of fiber running single wavelengths.
Some of the older undersea cables are still one or two OC48s,
but most of the new stuff is DWDM, typically with bandwidths of
40-160 Gbps now which can be fired up to faster speeds if demand grows.
JYA's web site, by the way, has some absolutely terrific maps and
photographs of a lot of undersea cable systems; we occasionally
use the stuff at work (it's especially good when you're giving talks,
because it's public material you don't have to clear with bureaucrats...)
 > Legacy ATM equipment
Oh, right, you work at one of those _little_ ISPs :-)
Actually, there is a huge amount of ATM equipment out there,
because DSL usually runs ATM protocols on the access lines,
so CLECs and LEC DSL providers usually hand it to the ISPs as ATM.
There's also a lot of ATM and frame for enterprise use
within companies, but in the big ISP world it's mostly phased out
except for DSL, because the router companies and ethernet switching
caught up with ATM speeds a few years ago and are now long past them.
MPLS is pretty much reimplementing all the things that ATM was good at,
and for the last few years everybody's been hyping how MPLS will make
things really cool real soon now, and it's gradually taking over.
 > [ how much data there is ]
AT&T's Internet Protect security service collects IP headers
from our peering points and hub locations, analyzing trends
like rapid increases in uses of some protocols.  We saw the
Slammer worm make a couple of startup attempts or trial runs
(not sure which) for about four days before it hit,
so we had filters ready, and we've seen similar things on
a number of other viruses and port-scanning attacks.
It also lets us see things like "Yes, there's a big spike in
use of Protocol _x_ but it's just a DDOS against one university machine",
and it's starting to be helpful in blocking DDOSs.
The system uses passive optical taps (there are lots of vendors
who sell gear like that), and collects over 10TB a day
(our total Internet traffic is about 1.4PB/day, so this is about 1%.)
The database at the head end is a bit less flexible than MS Access or MySQL,
but it's a lot larger than typical databases can handle,
and the kinds of calculations that make sense at that scale
are a bit different than what you could use if you were
targeting a smaller data set.  Some of the most useful calculations are
"what percentage of bits/packets/flows are protocol X
or TCP or UDP to/from port Y."

but in fact their visas had expired about 3 weeks earlier,
though the TSA thugs who interrogated them after they arrived
didn't notice it.
I was surprised they were musicians - I'd expected them to have
been a soccer team, and I've been on enough airplanes with
sports teams on them that their behavior sounds totally typical.
And Middle Easterners flying out of Detroit?  What a surprise!
(Detroit's one of the main places that Arab immigrants move.)

Rick Moen suggested we have a Cypherpunks meeting in August, so:
SF Bay Area Cypherpunks August 2004 Physical Meeting Announcement
General Info:
DATE: Saturday 14 August 2004
TIME: 12:00 - 5:00 PM (Pacific Time)
PLACE:   Stanford University Campus - Tressider Union courtyard
Agenda: "Our agenda is a widely-held secret."  (This will be our first
meeting since April 2003, so the agenda is somewhat up for grabs.
Among upcoming events to note is the 7th annual Information Security
Conference, aka ISC04, Sept. 27-29 at Xerox PARC,  .
Also of note:  Our friendly Federalistas seem to be imposing
unprecedented visa restrictions on visiting foreign cryptographers.
Is it time for all international cryptography conferences to move
off-shore?  See:   )
As usual, this is an "Open Meeting on US Soil", and the public is invited.
Location Info:
    The meeting location will be familiar to those who've been to our outdoor
    meetings before, but for those who haven't been, it's on the Stanford
    University campus, at the tables outside Tressider Union, at the end of
    Santa Theresa, just west of Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
    We meet at the tables on the west side of the building, inside the
    horseshoe "U" formed by Tresidder. Ask anyone on campus where Tressider
    is and they'll help you find it.
    Food and beverages are available at the cafe inside Tresidder.

@_subject: Reverse Scamming 419ers 
Troll bait - yum!   But this discussion is already partly my fault,
so I guess I'll bite.
It's true that most of these scammers have chosen a
life of non-violent theft that's more moral than some of the things
they could have done for money, like being bandits,
or joining the armies of the corrupt dictators they're
pretending to be the kids of.   That's still no excuse,
and they're in no position to complain if they get ripped off.
Furthermore, some suckers occasionally lose enough money to them
that they come to Nigeria looking for it, or come to Nigeria
to get their big payoffs, and some of the scammers demonstrate
that their non-violence is not based on principle but on opportunity,
so the suckers either get kidnapped for ransom, killed, or both.
But let's look a bit farther into the victims of these scams.
- Ordinary people get their time wasted by the volume of this stuff.
         -- If scammers don't mind wasting our time,
         they're in no position to complain if some "sucker"
         wastes their time by asking for a photograph of them
         dancing around with a chicken or whatever,
         and while they're doing that, they're not wasting my time.
- ISPs get their money wasted carrying this stuff.
         -- Scammers are in no position to complain if they
         occasionally get sued, or if their cybercafes get sued
         or cut off from the net and go out of business.
- Greedy suckers who don't mind accepting a cut of the money
         from the classic "corrupt murderous dictator" or
         "corrupt construction company"'s take.
         There are some people who'd contend that taking these people's
         money is a _good_ thing, just like taking the scammers' money is,
         but certainly they deserve whatever happens to them.
         Their wives and kids may or may not deserve it,
         but the beauty of the classic 419 scam is that they're
         unable to go to the police because they're as guilty as the scammers.
         It's too bad that the only way for these suckers to lose big money
         is for the scammers to get it, because otherwise it's kind of fun.
- Gullible suckers who actually believe the less immoral versions
         of the scam: "You've won the lottery", "My church needs money",
         "I'm dying and have no heirs and want to give my money away".
         Ripping off these people is wrong, and in many cases it's
         elderly people's life savings that they've got no way to replace,
         and the lying scum who are trying to rip them off deserve
         anything that happens to them, especially if it takes them
         out of action before they succeed and gets them revealed to their
         friends, families, and business acquaintances as incompetent thieves.
         It's more likely to succeed than complaining to the Nigerian police,
         but if the police actually _did_ anything more severe than
         demanding a cut of the profits, it would be much worse for the          and their families than simply losing money and getting laughed
         out of the cybercafe and Western Union office.  One good reason for
         operating a 419 scam out of a Netherlands cybercafe is that
         nobody's trying to impose Islamic law and cut your hand off...
         Evolution in action is certainly a good start here.
- There's also a middle ground of suckers, e.g. the ones who aren't
         accepting money from anything obviously criminal,
         but who should know bloody well that they probably don't have
         an uncle Fred  prospecting for oil in Nigeria
         for whom they're the next of kin, and that accepting the money
         rather than finding the "real" relatives who deserve it is dishonest,
         though it's ostensibly going to go to somebody who has just as
         little actual claim on the money, like the local government,
         so what the heck.  The scammers who try this one certainly
         deserve to get on other spammers' lists, lose a few bucks,
         and be encouraged to have embarrassing photos of themselves
         posted on the net.

enough to keep a T1 line busy with 3DES - presumably AES is much faster.
So either one should be good enough for most US DSL or cable modem
connections, and they'll at least handle an 802.11b 2 MHz channel
(yeah, the stuff says 10 Mbps, but you either need 802.11g or .11a or

As the Reuters article says,
         "Kennedy said the Nevada law was narrow and precise,
         requiring only that a suspect disclose his or her name.
         It does not require the suspect to produce a driver's license or any other document."
A great source for Supreme Court decisions is and this case is at Kennedy does acknowledge, more or less, that their decision is
increasing state powers and decreasing the rights of individuals.
My reading of the opinions is that we probably had a better 4th Amendment and that the 5th Amendment one was a bit weaker.
However, this doesn't mean that any cop anywhere can simply stop you and demand ID.
Nevada _does_ have a law requiring that you identify yourself.
However, in the Hiibel case, the cop demanded that he produce papers,
which the Nevada law does _not_ require.
In many states, the drivers license laws require you to produce your
license when asked, if you're carrying it, though I'm not sure how many
of them require that you produce it if you weren't driving.
... of course, _next_ month they'll address "Homeland Security vs. 260 Million John Does",
or whatever other case the Feds decide to trump up proactively.

@_subject: [IP] When police ask your name, you must give it, Supreme   
It's legal to _have_ any name you wish, but in some states you can
just use the name you want, and in other states you have to legally change your name.
California's DMV changed their policies five or ten years ago -
this used to be one of the places where changing your name on a whim was
not only freely accepted, but just about mandatory in Hollywood,
but at least the DMV now requires you to legally change your name
(not sure if the rest of the law requires it.)
No legal requirement that I'm aware of, nor is literacy mandatory.
Some individual types of paperwork may require that
(wouldn't surprise me if the INS thugs did, for instance,
though their standard rule in the past was that they'd assign you an
inaccurate transliteration...)  but that doesn't mean they all need the same.
You're not required to get a birth certificate, though if your kid's born
in a hospital they'll tend to issue one whether you ask for it or not.
I never applied for a social security number, so I haven't seen the forms
(my parents had already done that for me, and I assume that the number I
memorized in ~2nd grade was correct, though I've long since lost the paper.)
Go read the Supreme Court majority opinion - the states are mentioned there,
though the opinion doesn't say exactly what each state requires.
California, BTW, isn't on the list.
It tries :-)  It also tries to differentiate by address.
Most DMVs aren't very good at record-keeping, and the last two
states I've lived in have each spent ~$50 million on huge
computer modernization processes that have failed miserably...
State laws requiring SSN disclosure for driver's licenses were
illegal under the Privacy Act of 1974, and then legalized
for limited uses in ~1986, and the Feds have made them
all but mandatory.  They're also mandatory for income-taxable business,
except when you can use a Taxpayer ID Number instead.
You're overestimating the morals of the more conservative members
of the Court, though "fun" requires a sense of humor which
may be lacking in Rehnquist's case.....  (Some of them do have fun -
Scalia recently went hunting with Cheney, for instance,
and Thomas got raked over the coals at his acceptance hearings
because of the fun he'd had harassing Anita Hill.
And one or two of the liberals are a bit on the odd side as well.)
They didn't take this case just because they wanted it to -
they took it because Gilmore and Noise and friends helped Hiibel
and the Nevada Public Defender get it there.
They aren't likely to hear another case soon that isn't edgy like this,
but the FBI, Homeland Security thugs and their antecedents have been
pushing for more and more government control over citizens,
so any available edge is likely to get pushed.

> Bush is so evil I'll have to vote for the lesser evil
I felt that way about Reagan in 1984, and the Libertarians were
too disorganized to convince me otherwise.
Too bad the Democrats couldn't find a better candidate than Mondale.
My vote didn't change that landslide any, but it seems to have
helped the Democrats come up with a strategy for 1988,
which was to find the lamest available candidate and
run against someone other than Reagan, but voting for Dukakis
seemed to be throwing away my vote compared to voting for Ron Paul.
Fortunately, California will presumably be voting solidly Democrat,
though they'll probably still be using untrustable computerized
voting machines which only Republicans know how to steal instead of
the traditional Democrat-friendly versions.
I'd say Jonathan Edwards was marginally worse,
but he'll probably be the VP candidate.
Howard Dean threatened to turn the Democrats back into an
actual political party again, so the Democrats, Republicans,
and so-called liberal pro-establishment press made sure to
stomp on him (and if that didn't look well-coordinated,
you weren't paying attention.)
Joe Lieberman was the best Republican running, but he's out too.
But yeah, Kerry's best feature is that he's mostly evil on his own,
rather than Bush who had his father's old cronies pushing him,
who are frankly a lot more creatively evil than Kerry or Bush.
Also, while I don't understand the reality distortion effect that
makes Republicans and conservatives believe everything Bush says
deep down in their reptile brains even when their eyes are
telling them something different, I don't think Kerry has it,
and that's a Good Thing.

@_subject: Saving Opportunistic Encryption 
The simplest way to get half-safe opportunistic encryption is the "Open Secret" shared secret,
or equivalently, draft-ietf-ipsec-internet-key-00.txt's shared secret.  Everybody who wants to use it just adds it to their ipsec's list of known shared secrets, and uses it unless something better is available.  It doesn't pretend to be MITM-proof, but it's a start.  Doing the whole job correctly is much harder, which is why Gilmore's do-the-job-correctly-or-bust project didn't achieve the "encrypting X% of the net by Christmas", where X>1 and Christmas < 2010.  (This doesn't count the VPN market, which is what got the commercial support, even if many of the vendors used FreeS/WAN code, and it's a much easier problem even if ISAKMP/Oakley is a hard way to do something easy.)
Forward DNS support is widely available, because anybody out there who doesn't want to run their own DNS can find a friendly DNS provider who'll sell them a subdomain they can use, e.g. joecypherpunk.FriendlyDnsProvider.net, and they can even do DNSSEC support (though obviously you can't walk the whole tree unless the roots are signed.)  No ISP support needed.
Reverse DNS support was pretty much a non-starter, because most ISPs don't give the user control over their reverse DNS space even if they bother to implement it at all.   They're getting better, but you're still usually port123.box456.sfo.example.net, and forget getting DNSSEC support.  You *could* make it work by building a separate Reverse DNS tree, like D.B.C.A.opportunistic-encryption.org, instead of hanging it off D.B.C.A.in-addr.arpa.  You'd still have to get people to populate it, and make it scalable and DDOS-proof, but perhaps you could do it.
Reverse DNS also has the problem that it's _not_ a 1:1 matching - a given IP address may have many virtual hosts on it, and therefore many domain names, and the domain names can be different for email vs. web vs. other protocols.  So it can only work on a subset of the application space, even if you've got the control you need.
Of course, forward DNS isn't really what you want, and reverse DNS mostly is, because there isn't a user interface to your IPSEC interface or routing tables, especially if the IPSEC box is some security gateway that the end user doesn't even have access to, so unless you want to invent some other protocol (not ISAKMP/Oakley/etc.) to seed the IPSEC Security Associations, all you've got to work with   is the IP address of a destination, not a name.
It's possible to play hackish workarounds that have the DNS server opportunistically fetch DNSSEC information, with the assumption that most people only talk to IP addresses that they got from DNS lookups, and it even has the performance advantage that you can do the fetch before you send out any TCP or UDP packets to the destination instead of stalling and risking timeouts.  They're not hugely reliable, but they're a start, especially if you're going to fall back to "Open Secret".  They're mainly useful for machines that are doing their own IPSEC encryption, rather than using some IPSEC gateway/firewall box - otherwise you need to build dodgy configurations like running the DNS server on  the IPSEC gateway and making sure DNS caching and IPSEC SA caching times are compatible.   Also, working at this level means you're not just hacking the kernel, or the kernel plus some helper daemons - you're hacking BIND and its competitors, and suddenly you become responsible for maintaining them :-)
Another approach is to invent a whole new protocol, separate from ISAKMP/Oakley/SKIP/etc., which does a handshake to fetch keys.  It either has to hit a server at the destination's IP address, implying a need for firewall transparency and compatible address spaces (probably works better for transport mode than tunnel mode?), or else have some mechanism for finding a key+config server.  Hugh Daniel suggested rehabilitating Finger as the end-system protocol (after all, we've long since patched the security bugs that the Morris worm used back in 1988).  If you're building a non-end-to-end mechanism that uses IP addresses as its lookup, you're getting awfully close to reinventing Reverse DNS, or else building some other vast coordinated effort with half-vast goals.  On the other hand, if you're patching half of ISAKMP/Oakley anyway, might as well patch Photuris, which is much smaller, lighter, and more correct.

Firewalls may munge the TCP headers, and if you're just protecting the session setup,

If you want to be secure, either use IPSEC (in which case this isn't that or else use SSL if you'd rather wrap things in Layer 4.

Duhhh..   is a competing service, run by different people.
You don't "ask for a retraction" that names somebody else
unless it was somebody else who did it, or at least you don't do so
with the expectation that you'll _get_ the retraction
as opposed to getting flamed in public.
Surfola's privacy policy does say that they won't ever, at any time,
for any reason, give your name, residence address, or email address
to any third party.  I guess we know how much to trust that,
though strictly speaking, it doesn't say they won't give out IP addresses,
and at least one of the articles said that the Feebs could track him down
because he didn't have the sense to use an internet cafe
instead of connecting from home.  (On the other hand,
it said he paid for the anonymization service using Paypal and
giving his own email address, so it's possible that Surfola _did_
rat him out in ways that contradict their privacy policy.)
Also, the original anonymous posting said "no subpoena involved",
but didn't indicate that they knew this was true.
It sounded like it might have been correct, but might not.
Now, this kind of application of Blacknet is the sort of thing
that gives privacy protection a bad name - the guy certainly
deserved to be caught and busted, as well as deserved to have
Darwin remind him that he wasn't as bright as he thought he was....
But Surfola's privacy policy shouldn't be making promises that
it can't keep, or that it doesn't intend to keep.
It appears to be based on a BellSouth DSL line in/near Jacksonville, FL,
which means that Kris is subject not only to warrants,
but also subpoenas, FISA Secret Court Gag-Ordered Subpoenas,
Patriot Act secret gag-ordered requests for assistance from Homeland Security,
legal or illegal wiretaps on anything unencrypted,
and any fishing trips that the local police want to take
(at least if he's not running encrypted disk partitions.)
Its privacy policy ought to reflect that,
even if such things aren't particularly enforceable.

@_subject: Anonymity of prepaid phone chip-cards 
What do you mean by "Trick"?  Is that a local brand name,
or are you implying there's something special about this card?
Normal phone cards let their issuers know in almost-real-time that
they're being used, because they're spending money from a
specific debit account, not digital cash tokens.
It's not like old-fashioned monthly phone bills,
which didn't need to be in real-time because they
knew where you lived (and weren't real money anyway*,
except for international calls requiring settlements.)
Some cards have more information - many brands can be recharged
using a credit card, which might identify the user.
Well, of course - databases are much easier these days
now that megabits/second and gigahertz are slow and terabytes are small and and calling card companies _are_ fundamentally in the business
of doing database queries and updates, not telecommunications.
They're even easier for new competitive phone companies than
for the old monopolies, because they don't have an embedded base
of antique data structures.
An initial call to someone might not be easily traced in near-real-time,
unless the recipient was a "usual suspect" set up for it,
because that's backwards from the normal database structures.
But once you've done the medium or hard work to identify
the source of the call after the fact, and gotten lucky by
finding it was from a phone card company in your country,
setting up a forward trace for future calls from that company
shouldn't be very difficult.   It's the kind of feature that
might only be useful to police and other stalkers,
but maybe the phone company had operational reasons for building it,
and it looks for data in the Simple Matter of Programming direction,
not the Huge Difficult Sieve Through Everything direction.

Wow!  It was "EXAMINED BY LAWYERS!"  That's almost as reassuring as
saying it was "Generated by a Computer"!  (OK, these days it really _is_
better when the Pentagon says something was examined by their JAG corps
rather than decided by the political appointees running the Pentagon...)
They don't even say if it's DoD lawyers or IRS lawyers or other lawyers.
There's a wide range in the types of methods they could use
to find this information, some of which are the camel's nose in the tent
and others of which are half the camel, but all of which are pretty much bad.
I suppose the DoD could hand the IRS a list of names+SSNs and ask them
to deliver the mail without any feedback to the DoD,
but if the project has only been approved by "lawyers" and not by
anybody with a clue about information technology or privacy protection,
it's a bad bad idea.
I get occasional junk snailmail as a veteran, trying to sell me something
or other that veterans are apparently suckers for.
I'm *not* a veteran (I was 1H in the last draft lottery),
and I'm assuming that they're sending me the information because
I'm male and the right age group, rather than because some database
actually _does_ think I'm a veteran, but I'd really rather not have
the IRS telling the Army where I live just in case they might think that.
It's bad enough if they're acting on real information,
but there are all kinds of other problems that can happen with bad info,
such as them looking for a previous resident of this address,
or getting mixed up with nearby addresses (my neighbor was Navy.)
I'm also not thrilled with the DMV telling my local police the
address of my neighbor's legality-challenged son, and getting it wrong,
which led to the police pounding on my door at 6am with a warrant.

Implementation may now be possible, and the costs may be lower

Here's a nightclub you'll want to skip, unless you feel like hacking RFIDs...
("Nothing up my sleeve but this Rivest RFID Blocker!")
** Barcelona clubbers get chipped **
Some clubbers in Barcelona have opted to have a microchip implanted which
lets them pay for drinks.
<  >
BBC Science producer Simon Morton goes clubbing in Barcelona with a
microchip implanted in his arm to pay for drinks.
Imagine having a glass capsule measuring 1.3mm by 1mm, about the size of a
large grain of rice injected under your skin.
Implanting microchips that emit a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
into animals has been common practice in many countries around the world,
with some looking to make it a legal requirement for domestic pet owners.
The idea of having my very own microchip implanted in my body appealed. I
have always been an early adopter, so why not.
Last week I headed for the bright lights of the Catalan city of Barcelona
to enter the exclusive VIP Baja Beach Club.
The night club offers its VIP clients the opportunity to have a
syringe-injected microchip implanted in their upper arms that not only
gives them special access to VIP lounges, but also acts as a debit account
from which they can pay for drinks.
This sort of thing is handy for a beach club where bikinis and board shorts
are the uniform and carrying a wallet or purse is really not practical.
Thumping heart
I met the owner of the club, Conrad Chase, who had come up with the idea
when trying to develop the ultimate in membership cards and was the first
person implanted with the capsule, made by VeriChip Corporation.
With a waiver in his hand Conrad asked me to sign my life away, confirming
that if I wanted the chip removed it was my responsibility.
Four aspiring VIP members sat quietly sipping their beverages as the nurse
Laia began preparing the surgical materials.
Like a scene from a sci-fi movie, latex gloves and syringes were laid out
on the table as the DJ played loud dance tunes that made my heart thump, or
was it just fear?
Questions were going through my mind. Would it hurt? What are the risks?
What if I want to get it out?
I ordered another drink.
Comfortably numb
Laia started by disinfecting my upper arm and then administered a local
anaesthetic to numb the area where the chip would be implanted.
With the large needle in her hand, she tested the zone which made me flinch
and led to another dose of the anaesthetic.
With a numb arm, Laia held up the rather large needle containing the
microchip and inserted it beneath the layer of skin and fat on my arm.
She pressed the injector and it was in - my very own 10 digit number safely
located in my body.
The chip is made of glass and is inert so there is no risk of it reacting
with my body.
It sits dormant under the skin sending out a very low range radio frequency
so it will not set off airport security systems.
The chip responds to a signal when a scanner is held near it and supplies
its own unique ID number.
The number can then be linked to a database that is linked to other data,
at the Baja beach club it make charges to a customers account.
If I want to leave the club then I can have it surgically removed - a
pretty simple procedure similar to having it put in.
Now, the question of did it hurt. Having the chip inserted was a breeze, no
real pain to report of.
The real pain was the sore head the following day after a night on an open
bar tab.

Fundamentalism doesn't make people kill people.
Being pissed off does.  Being scared does.
Believing that those people are a threat to a Higher Cause
you Believe In does, whether it's religion, country, family, etc.
Wanting other people's stuff does.
Failing to believe that other people matter does
if they happen to be in your way.
Failing to believe that other people matter does
if it looks like it'll help you get what you want.
Being stupid might not directly make people kill people,
but it can affect whether you think the other conditions apply
and/or who you kill if you're going to kill people.
Some of those things make you willing to die in the process
of killing the people you want killed, and some don't,
though there's the intermediate case of being willing to have
people on Your Side get killed as long as it's not you.
McVeigh was pissed off, and he believed that the Feds
as a whole were a threat to America, so he decided to kill
Feds who were an easy target, as opposed to, say,
raiding a well-armed BATF headquarters.
The kids in the next buildings were just collateral damage.
Bush, on the other hand, doesn't believe other people matter,
and getting US soldiers killed or Iraqi children killed
or lying to the American public about them being Safer is fine,
though Saddam trying to kill his Daddy really pissed him off,
and war is the health of the state, which is him and his buddies.
You really don't want Carlos the Jackal on your flight.
Non-suicidal airplane bombers might bring a bomb onto a plane
and hide it under the seat so it'll blow up on the next flight,
or hide it inside somebody else's luggage so it'll blow up on
_their_ next flight, or whatever.  And they've usually done
more thinking about how to get away with it, though they're
trying to solve a much harder problem than suicide bombers are.
James Bamford's latest book "A Pretext for War"
is mainly about the Bush Administration's willingness
to use 9/11 as an excuse for the war they wanted even before
they got into office, but he spends a while excoriating the CIA
for being a bunch of bleeding incompetents.
The CIA spent a while trying to chase and kill bin Laden,
while constantly losing track of most of his organizations,
but they didn't ever try infiltrating Al Qaeda, because they
thought it would be too difficult to pass off their infiltrators
as credible due to cultural differences.
Yet Johnny Walker Lindh and Richard Shoebomber Reid
didn't much trouble joining them.  Bamford apparently
believes that Reid was the genuine article, though Reid sure
looks like the ideal guy you'd use if you wanted to
scare the public by planting an unsuccessful crazy bomber wannabee.

Depends a lot on how high up the planes are when you throw them off...
There's the concept of "due process of law" that
the Bush administration isn't very familiar with

Unfortunately, the primary algorithm seems to work like this:

None of those things sound like terrorism to me,
just basic military violence, though certainly the
American and Russian militaries aren't the only ones
engaging in terrorist activities in South Asia
and some of these ~146 people may be among them.
But most of the Warlord-vs-Warlord fighting in Afghanistan
isn't terrorism, and most of the Iraqi Resistance isn't either,
and I'd have expected that a staunch anti-communist like James
wouldn't mind people shooting at Russian soldiers even though
they're no longer Soviets.
While the ones murdering Iraqi Christians may be doing it out of
religious hatred as well as the perception that the
Americans are running a Christian crusade against the Muslim world,
the Indonesian invasions of their neighbors such as East Timor
are just good old nationalist expansion -
the US has been funding the Indonesian military for ~40 years
because they're our Anti-Communist buddies,
and who cares about their human rights records.

@_subject: Printers betray document secrets 
It turns out that their techniques aren't all that useful.
Changing laser printer cartridges changes the results.
You might find that two documents were printed
by the same printer, but it doesn't give you the
options for tracking it down that manual typewriters did.
And the differences don't identify a specific printer
in a way that can be tracked, e.g. identifying a serial number
that could be looked up from warranty records.
It's not clear that they work at all with inkjet printers,
and changing ink cartridges is even more common than
changing laser printer cartridges.  If you're sloppy,
you've probably got a bunch of partly-used cartridges around,
so even if you want to print out a bunch of ransom notes
or whatever, you don't even have to go to Kinko's
to get them to be different.
If printer makers want to build in watermarking to
make everything they print traceable, the way many of them
check for documents that look like money and don't print them,
they could hide patterns that survive cartridge changes
(would you notice a few inverted pixels on a 600x600dpi printout?)
But even then, inkjet printers are dirt cheap;
when they're on sale, they're essentially a free enclosure
in a box of overpriced printer cartridges,
so even of the printer wants to rat out the user and
it's not easy to change the serial number PROM,
you can just replace the printer.

James - Many, perhaps most, of the POWs at Gitmo weren't foreigners,
they were Afghans.  Many of the POWs at Gitmo probably were Al-Qaeda
or other organized paramilitary groups.  But many of them were
described by the US propagandists as "Taliban fighters" -
the military arm of the local central government who were
"legitimate" to the extent that any group of warlords
who are the current king of the hill are legitimate,
and not too many months before the invasion,
the US government was giving those same Taliban $43million
because they were so helpful in our War on Drugs.
And sure, they're a nasty bunch, but so are many of the
anti-communist military juntas the US supported over the years.
It wasn't like the US didn't know the Taliban were
tolerating anti-American terrorist groups at the time -
Clinton's Pentagon had bombed some of the camps in ~97
as well as the Sudan medical factory in response to
bin Laden's bombing of the US embassies in Africa.
Also, perhaps you don't realize this, but many countries
with central governments do allow foreigners to stay there,
whether as immigrants, tourists, guestworkers, businessmen,
students, or attendees of terrorist training camps like the
School of the Americas or the Osama bin Laden gang.
Countries without effective central governments are usually
more flexible about such things, and cultures that are
tribally organized with colonialist-drawn boundaries
are also less likely to be picky about it, though they may
be more picky about whose tribal land you're in.

Kerry's a content-free stuffed shirt who no longer has the guts

and Edwards is all pretty face with no apparent soul either.
He's thoroughly failed to propose anything positive or concrete
(saying "Help is on the way" just doesn't cut it,
especially if you don't have anything to offer except not being Bush)
and he's let his "I'm a war hero" stance
get in the way of bashing Bush's incompetence in the war
and bashing Bush's fundamental dishonesty.
He's let Karl Rove dominate the emotional campaign,
and failed to take the high road aggressively
but tried to fight back against Rove on Rove's territory, which is futile.
The only time he really got anywhere emotionally was during
the parts of the debates where he would talk about how Bush's father did x/y/z

and he failed to catch on to the fact that Bush-o-nomics is

Middletown NJ has one also (about an hour from the city by car, YMMV by tank.)
Back in the revolutionary days of the 60s and 70s,
the police chief, who was actually named Joe McCarthy and tried
to live up to the name, was concerned that the
Puerto Ricans in the ethnic neighborhoods along the shore
might get uppity and take over the naval base, which everybody knew
had Nuke-u-lur Weapons even though they'd never admit it,
and the naval base might not be able to defend itself against a mob,
so he convinced the town council that they needed to buy a tank.
I haven't seen it, but one of my friends said that when he last saw it,
it hadn't been moved in a while and had sunk about a foot into the mud.
(When I'd first heard they had a tank, I'd assumed it was
really some amphibious military vehicle they used for
hauling cars out of the swamps or something, but no, it's a regular tank.)

I think the US state of Nevada has "None of the above" as an option,
though I'm not sure the implementation of it.
The Libertarian Party in the US always has NOTA as a candidate
in internal elections, and sometimes NOTA wins and the job
goes unfilled until either there's a new election with new candidates
or some executive committee appoints somebody.
NOTA's a bit different - there may be a large plurality of voters
who don't like the major candidates, even if they don't agree
on who else they want.  In a election where you're voting for a party,
like most parliamentary governments use, voting NOTA is telling the parties
to run different candidates, so for instance you might want
the Labour Party to win but you don't like Tony Blair so you vote NOTA
in his home district.  In candidate-based elections,
you're telling the individual candidates that you don't like them.

@_subject: Remailers an unsolvable paradox? 
There are several different types of problem messages,
and some are easier to avoid than others.
- Spam
- Harassing messages sent to remailer users
- Harassing messages sent to mundanes to annoy the mundane
- Harassing messages sent to mundanes to get the remailer in trouble
- Harassing messages sent to third-parties (e.g. sending Bob slander about - Forged messages
- Usenet flamebait
Two of the things I never built back when I was running a remailer
could have helped this problem
- Encrypted-sending only.  Sure, you want to only accept encrypted messages
         to preserve privacy, but if you require outgoing messages
         to be encrypted, you not only protect privacy,
         you eliminate most of the spam, except for spam that's sent to
         people with easily-located public keys.
         Sadly, that's a small set of people, but it's also
         tougher for harvester programs, and it's a set of people
         less likely to buy from spammers.
         This also significantly reduces harassment potential.
         Most crypto users are more likely to understand remailers,
         or at least to read the "this is a remailer" headers.
         It's possible for harassers to work around this,
         if you're verifying encryption just by syntax, but it's a good start:
                 ----- BEGIN PGP ENCRYPTED STUFF
                 Alice - your mother was a hamster and your father
                 smells of elderberries.   And your hovercraft is full of eels. Bob
                 ----- END PGP ENCRYPTED STUFF ---
- Recipient permission for outbound remailers - have the remailer
         ask for permission before sending somebody mail,
         and optionally store addresses (or hashes of addresses)
         of people who want to accept remailed messages in the future
         (obviously including other remailers in that list.)
         So instead of sending the message directly, you send
                 "Subject: You've received an anonymous message                  You've received an anonymous message at (foo-remailer)
                 It may be from someone you know, or may be a forgery or spam
                 (explain remailers blah blah blah)
                 If you'd like to pick up the message, reply to this message.
                 If you don't want it, just ignore this message.
                 If you'd like us to never bother you again, reply with                  in the future, reply with Subject: SUBSCRIBE
                 (and/or provide web URL interfaces for these functions.)
         Even if the remailed mail is spam or harassment, it starts out with
         getting permission from the recipient and building a positive          and some understanding of what's going on.  It also means that if
         somebody who doesn't care about remailers gets spam or harassing mail,
         they don't have to get it more than once.

It's not a hard problem, just a different problem.
Whitelisting your friends and aggressively filtering strangers
is an obvious technique for reducing false positives

RMX-derivatives help this problem, and they help the joe-job problem.
If a spammer wants to claim that they're the genuine spammers-are-us.biz,

I find it more annoying that there are spammers putting PGP headers

I read the draft, and I don't see how it offers any improvement
over draft-ietf-ipsec-internet-key-00.txt or Gilmore's proposal touse "open secret" as a not-very-secret pre-shared secret
that anybody who wants to can accept.
It does introduce some lower-horsepower alternatives for
authenticating less than the entire packet, and suggests
using AH which I thought was getting rather deprecated these days,
but another way to reduce horsepower needs is to use AES instead of 3DES.
Also, the author's document discusses protecting BGP to prevent
some of the recent denial-of-service attacks,
and asks for confirmation about the assertion in a message
on the IPSEC mailing list suggesting
    "E.g., it is not feasible for BGP routers to be configured with the
    appropriate certificate authorities of hundreds of thousands of peers".
Routers typically use BGP to peer with a small number of partners,
though some big ISP gateway routers might peer with a few hundred.
(A typical enterprise router would have 2-3 peers if it does BGP.)
If a router wants to learn full internet routes from its peers,
it might learn 1-200,000, but that's not the number of direct connections
that it has - it's information it learns using those connections.
And the peers don't have to be configured "rapidly without external assistance" -
you typically set up the peering link when you're setting up the
connection between an ISP and a customer or a pair of ISPs,
and if you want to use a CA mechanism to certify X.509 certs,
you can set up that information at the same time.

Blast sets off the forest fire, fire makes the smoke.  Not a problem.
Go visit Northern California in late summer firestorm season
(though we don't need fertilizer plants to start fires;
smaller accidents or stupid people can do the job just fine.)
No FO, just AN all by itself.  NH4NO3 turns into N2 + 2H2O + O,
and the leftover O finds something productive to do,
like combine with another O into O2, or burn some nearby carbon,
and it's hot enough the H2O is gaseous also.
If you've got FO, it'll happily combine with the spare O,
producing lots of heat and speeding up the reaction.
The first earthquake-like event I experienced was when a
chemical plant across the river from where I lived blew up;
I think it was a fertilizer plant of some sort.
(I was in Delaware; the plant was in New Jersey, and it was ~1968.)
Fertilizer plants blow up real good; about the only thing better
are ammunition depots and maybe explosives plants,
and usually those are built to contain the explosion better.
(By the way, most people think of the Parthenon as an ancient ruin;
it was actually in very good shape, roof and all, until ~1850,
when the Greeks were using it as an ammunition depot during
one of their wars with the Turks and the Turks blew it up.)

The interesting attacks were a sequence-number guessing attack
using forged TCP RST packets, which tell the TCP session to tear down,
therefore dropping the BGP connection (typically between two ISPs).
The attackers didn't need to be trusted backbone routers -
they could be randoms anywhere on the Internet.
BGP authentication doesn't actually help this problem,
because the attack simply kills the connection at a TCP layer
rather than lying to the BGP application.
A simple way to avoid most of this problem is to
filter packets at the edges so that customer connections
can't send IP (or ICMP, while you're at it) packets
to the core addresses on the routers that do the BGP signalling.
(It's not a complete solution, because both ends of the connection
need to so that, or need to do spoof-proofing so nobody can forge packets
from those addresses, or both.)  Customers can still send packets
to the ISP edge routers supporting their own connections,
but killing your own internet connection is much less entertaining
than killing somebody else's, and if the customer is managing their own router,
their users probably have an easier time killing that end of the connection
than convincing the ISP's end to drop the connection.
(One downside to this approach is that customers can't simply ping routers
to get information about paths, latencies, capacities, etc.,
but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Also, you can set things up
so they can traceroute to the far end of a connection and still get
traceroute responses from the intermediate routers.)
I agree with Joe.  You can fix most of the problems using ACLs,
but IPSEC does have some appeal to it.
You don't even need CAs - pre-shared secrets are perfectly adequate,
but if you want to use a CA-based IPSEC implementation for convenience,
you can agree on what CA to use when you're agreeing on other parameters.

Oh - I'd misunderstood.  Yes, that sounds much harder to forge,
so it's actually useful for DOS reduction.
There are two reasons to use the CA.
One is if the parties don't know each other (not a problem here),
but the other is so the VPN receiver has some external validation
on the data it receives, making MITM attacks harder.
For applications like BGP, you don't care if the CA is
Dun & Bradstreet or if it's just Alice's own CA,
because it's really functioning as a shared secret
but the commodity VPN hardware wants an X.509 cert
for MITM protection.

@_subject: Mystification of Identity: You Say Yusuf, I Say Youssouf... 
Of course it doesn't.   However, if there are known potential hijackers
who travel under their True Names or Known Aliases,
and if there's a list of them that can be checked against,
knowing the name you're using can validate whether you might be one of them,
and preventing you from flying means you can't carry out your
Clever New Hijacking Plan, such as converting that small guitar
into a set of six piano-wire garrotes or mixing that
liquid oxygen shoe sole with rum to form an explosive,
and it prevents you from using previously undetected explosives
in your luggage or whatever.
There are several reasons you might divert a plane in this environment -
- to spank the airline for not being careful enough
         about checking the list, independent of any hijacking risk.
- to cover the ass of the person who put the wrong spelling on the list,
         even though the US Enemies Airline Blacklist supposedly has
         the passport numbers of Official US Enemies and therefore should
         have been able to get the spelling from Yousouff's UK passport.
- to prevent a potential hijacker from hijacking the plane during the
         descent phase of the flight, in case they're planning to
         crash it into Washington instead of London, or to reduce the time
         that the plane is in the air, in case there's a timed-release bomb
         in the luggage.  (Ideally you'd like to prevent them and their
         luggage from getting on at all, but it was too late for that,
         and if there's a pressure-triggered luggage bomb you've already lost.)
- to maintain the pretense that the people on the list are
         potential hijackers or airplane suicide bombers,
         as opposed to people who might sing politically inconvenient music
         or give talks that encourage other potential US Enemies
         or give the money to hire other people to do the dangerous bits.
- to be extremely conservatively overcautious because you've
         discovered that you mistakenly let someone on the plane
         and the version of the Enemies List that you have access to
         doesn't indicate which people are actively dangerous passengers
         of the potential hijacker/bomber type,
         as opposed to political Enemies who you could arrange to
         harass at Customs after they've arrived,
         and you don't have the time to find out why they're there
         before landing (hey, it took Teddy Kennedy three tries),
         so you throw the Better Safe Than Sorry dice and decide
         you can spin the PR Fearmongering if you're oversensitive.
I'd guess that the working-level decision was the latter conservative though the decision-makers preferred to think of it as the third case.
Conservatism is easier when _you're_ not going to have to
pay for the extra airplane costs or deal with the other passengers who
miss their airline connections because you stuck them in Bangor,
which are somebody else's problem.
The entertaining questions are when they figured out that he was
the well-known Cat Stevens and not just the generic-Moslem-sounding Mr. Islam,
and whether there are pre-defined policies about landing them in Bangor
when they ostensibly had enough advance notice to land them in
Newfoundland or Labrador instead, which aren't US territory.

@_subject: More Convenient Use of Electronic Gold Payments 
I've used E-Gold in the past, and found that the hardest part
of the process is buying the stuff to put in your account -
setting up an account and paying people with it are both easy,
but to buy the gold, you need to find some way to give somebody
some other kind of money so they'll give you electronic gold.
If you want $10000 worth, or want to transfer physical gold,
it's not hard, but if you just want small quantities it was annoying.
Jim Davidson's article talked about E-Gold and other currencies,
and almost all of them operate under a model in which
the gold service transfers gold credits between accounts,
but buying the gold credits with other types of money
is handled by third-party retailers, and almost none of the retailers
will accept credit cards or Paypal without long delays,
though they'll happily accept other gold currencies.
There's now a much more convenient way to buy online gold - goldage.net.
To pay them cash, you do an online form, then go to a bank they use,
and fill out a deposit slip with their account number from the form,
and hand the bank your cash, and then do another form to say you did it.
They use banks in USA, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines,
Singapore and South Africa.  Their US banks include
Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and three or four others.
You don't need to set up an account with them - they mostly do
transactional business, though their fees are a bit lower
if you're a large frequent customer.
The gold currency payment isn't instant - it can take a couple
of days for Goldage to see that the deposit was made.
They seem to be a small operation, so they're very responsive to email.
A couple of months ago, I wanted to pay for some services
using an online gold currency, and the merchant
accepts E-gold, Pecunix, and several other gold currencies.
I didn't want to use E-Gold itself, because there are too many
spammers phishing for people's e-gold account information
the way they do for credit cards, and I didn't want to have
to miss any _real_ email from them mixed in with the spam.
Pecunix was one of the gold currencies that my merchant's
online payment system Goldcart accepted, and they were easy to use.
So I did the online form at Goldage, deposited the cash at the bank,
checked Pecunix a couple of days later, and paid the merchant.
I think the total fees were about $6-7 between the different
service providers, mostly the $5 minimum fee at Goldage,
and I may have a buck or two of round-off-error money sitting in Pecunix,
but the percentage costs would be lower if I were using it more frequently
rather than a one-shot transaction.
It worked very well, and was much simpler than a few years ago.

@_subject: Google prioritises results for firefox and mozilla users 
Firefox / Mozilla has a prefetching feature
that you can turn on and off,
which can occasionally speed up your next click by prefetching,
so the page(s) you're most likely to read next are
loading in the background while you're reading the page you're on.
What Google's doing is including information in their results pages
that Firefox recognizes as the page to pre-fetch next.
This means that if Google's highest-ranked page is what you want,
then you can get to it faster.
Prefetching can make web browsing dramatically faster or slower.
I tend to read online news by loading lots of tabs in the background,
e.g. the interesting articles from Google New or NYTimes.com.
That tends to be somewhat slow already, because Mozilla is a real
memory hog, and prefetching would just make it worse.
On the other hand, if it loads the *right* pages, it's really nice.

I see a couple of problems with your proposal.
I'm not sure I like your external trusted mail-server assumptions,
but they're probably good enough for many people,
and other people will have better comments about them.
Your plan is really designed for a small number of addresses per sender,
as opposed to a quasi-infinite set of tagged addresses.
It's becoming pretty common for anti-spam reasons
to give different recipients different mail addresses like
         tag at mydomain.com (or tag at mysubdomain.domain.com) or
         myname+tag at domain.com
so you can track and whitelist/blacklist people you communicate with,
and some ISPs automagically translate between the two formats.
Building a user interface that does that unobtrusively
is probably a hard problem, or at least not a well-solved one,
and building a cryptosystem that assumes a small number of
addresses per user could make that style of mailer harder.
A good user interface probably has some version of petname support,
though, so there's some commonality with key handling.
On the other hand, if you assume that most people will get domains,
whether 2LD or 3LD or other subdomain,
you could do a model that says that a user gets one key per domain,
so you could think about hanging the keys off DNS.
That may not be the right choice (do you want your email addresses
to be easily correlated, and cracking/stealing one address's key
to reveal the keys you use for everybody else?  Or does the domain
pretty much imply that to the skilled recipient anyway so who cares?)
And of course it gets into the whole squabble about DNSSEC,
and why its deployment failed, and whether it was trying to do
a perfect job and therefore less scalable than a mostly-good-enough job,
or at least into the politics of those questions if not the technology.
The related problem is what to do if you *do* want different keys
for different recipients; you could do that with different subdomains,
or you could do a non-DNS approach.
- Is (sender+recipient+timestamp+message) the right thing to sign?
The Subject: line is in the mail headers, but it's probably
something that should be part of the message.
I'm not sure about some various X-headers.
And of course the From: line includes both the email address
and the sender's name, and the sender's name may be different
for different recipients (in some sense, it may be the
recipient's petname for the sender.)
- Also, if you're attaching a key strictly to the email address,
what happens to old signatures if you move email addresses?
I suppose that's part of the point of getting your own domain name,
so you can avoid having to change contact addresses when you change ISPs,
but if you're using a new email address, how do you forward the signature?
One option is to do what you can do in Crypto Kong,
where you send a message from old-address signed by old-address,
saying that you'll be using new address and new key,
but that seems a bit awkward, since you need a convenient way to
include the new keys for people who whitelist you or who you
only want to send encrypted mail to.

The related problem is what to do if you *do* want different keys
for different recipients; you could do that with different subdomains,
or you could do a non-DNS approach.
- Is (sender+recipient+timestamp+message) the right thing to sign?
The Subject: line is in the mail headers, but it's probably
something that should be part of the message.
I'm not sure about some various X-headers.
And of course the From: line includes both the email address
and the sender's name, and the sender's name may be different
for different recipients (in some sense, it may be the
recipient's petname for the sender.)
- Also, if you're attaching a key strictly to the email address,
what happens to old signatures if you move email addresses?
I suppose that's part of the point of getting your own domain name,
so you can avoid having to change contact addresses when you change ISPs,
but if you're using a new email address, how do you forward the signature?
One option is to do what you can do in Crypto Kong,
where you send a message from old-address signed by old-address,
saying that you'll be using new address and new key,
but that seems a bit awkward, since you need a convenient way to
include the new keys for people who whitelist you or who you
only want to send encrypted mail to.

Any online payment service that has a convenient mechanism for
Americans to add funds has at least one new potential market -
cigarettes by mail from low-tax jurisdictions such as Indian reservations.
The Feds recently bullied the credit card companies into
not accepting payments for cigarettes (probably affects
Paypal indirectly as well), so all of a sudden there's a
market for something beyond the privacy services.
Of course, the kinds of people who smoke cigarettes are
not necessarily the kinds of people who are good at
exploring privacy-protection services intelligently (:-),
but a couple hundred bucks a month to avoid nicotine fits
can be enough motivation for some people.
If you can believe wmtransfer's statistics,
they're probably getting a few thousands of dollars a day
on their deposit/withdrawal fees,
(if the transactions are denominated in rubles)
or a few tens of thousands if they're in dollars/euros.
That would imply that a cigarette company would probably be safe
risking a couple of days' float using their payment system,
because it's almost always worth more money to the payment company
to stay in business than to rip off all of their accounts payable and fold.
(Probably not worth risking a month's float, especially if the
payment system were connected to the US Russian Mafia,
who could coordinate ordering a large quantity of cigarettes
for resale with absconding with the payments,
but a couple of days should be safe enough.)
It's certainly worthwhile for cigarette companies to
deal with most of the more reputable online e-money companies.
The one I'd actually be most worried about is e-gold -
they're probably the biggest of them, and one of the most convenient,
but the phishers aggressively go for their customers,
and they don't do enough digital authentication
for Joe Average Smoker to know if he's being phished.
They could probably fix that, but of course any other
company that made a significant dent in cigarette sales
would also become a phishing target as well.

Last time I wanted to use an online gold system,
I used pecunix as the currency and goldage.net
as the payment handler.  That was partly because of the
fees for the size of transactions I was doing
(for small transactions, the minimum fee is more important
than the percentage), but partly for convenience -
one way to pay Goldage in the US is to go to a bank
where they have an account and make a deposit -
Wells Fargo is one of their more widespread banks.
Credit cards are of course much more than a security issue -
chargebacks are a major problem for a vendor who's
shipping out gold credits immediately, especially if they're
anonymous accounts which can transfer anonymously.

Yes, of course :-)  Writing a check would have been silly,
and Goldage.net doesn't accept them for bank deposits,
only for direct mailin.  (They do accept bank wires,
but not EFTs or Paypal.)
I suppose I probably did use the ATM
outside the bank to get the cash I carried in to deposit,
but there were a dozen people in the bank line
and this wasn't a really high-security transaction.
Goldage, which I used to buy the pecunix,
doesn't use accounts, but they do need an email address
for handling each transaction.  For larger customers
who handle a lot of volume, they can provide some
frequent-customer information so you can get better rates and speed,
but it's still not an account that stores value.
I don't remember if I used the same account for the
goldage and pecunix parts of the transaction,
or if I used disposable accounts for one or both.

I'm still having trouble understanding your threat model.
If you're talking about somebody who can get Hotmail's cooperation,  e.g. cops or sysadmins,
there's no way you can prevent them from doing anything they want to your incoming mail.
If you're worried about crackers guessing your password,
then some web-based email systems automatically mark mail as read,
some don't, some let you mark it, some let you remark it as unread.
(I haven't ever used hotmail, and my cat stopped using it when the
Child Online Protection Act required Hotmail to cancel accounts
for anybody under 13 years old who didn't have parental permission,
so the interface has probably changed since I last saw it.)
Are you worried specifically about Hotmail?
You're mentioning using gmail to pre-filter your hotmail messages -
gmail's going to have similar potential threats,
except that it's probably better managed,
and if you're going to send the mail to gmail anyway,
why not just read it on gmail?
In general, if you've sent unencrypted email to an untrusted system,
then you've got no way of knowing that it hasn't been read.

Irksome Firm Nearly Ejected From Air Show
By Lyuba Pronina
Staff Writer
Ivan Sekretarev / AP
Spectators watching the Patrouille de France aerobatic team perform during the MAKS air show at the Zhukovsky airfield outside Moscow on Saturday.
ZHUKOVSKY, Moscow Region -- The jamming equipment made by Aviakonversia is so effective against U.S. planes and missiles that it apparently provoked an angry phone call to the Kremlin from U.S. President George W. Bush in the first days of the Iraq war.
Russian officials do not seem to have forgotten the scandal and on Friday tried to shut down the company's stand at the Seventh Moscow Aviation and Space Show, MAKS 2005, said Aviakonversia director Oleg Antonov.
Perhaps the company's presence was simply too embarrassing, considering that the U.S. Air Force occupied a prominent place on the tarmac, displaying a B-1B bomber, F-15 and F-16 fighters, and two bulbous tanker planes used in mid-air refueling.
Three representatives of the Federal Industry Agency and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control, which oversees the export of defense technology, unsuccessfully attempted to close the stand on the grounds that Aviakonversia had not received clearance from the Defense Ministry to showcase its product, Antonov said.
The government representatives, concealing their ID badges, did not allow this reporter to be present during their conversation with Antonov.
"They demanded we pack up, but we have the right to be here -- we paid the rent for this stall," Antonov said after the meeting. "We have made the product using our own money and do not need the approval from the Defense Ministry, a grocery director or a banya director."
The Federal Industry Agency was unavailable for comment over the weekend.
Aviakonversia, which makes devices that jam the global positioning systems used in navigation, caused a storm of protest from Washington in the early days of the Iraq war in March 2003.
Antonov, who for 24 years worked in the State Research Institute of Aviation Systems developing defense systems for planes, founded Aviakonversia with a dozen staffers in 1992.
The company developed jammers that interfere with GPS signals and were apparently used by Iraqi forces during the U.S.-led invasion.
The Bush administration charged that Aviakonversia personnel were on the ground instructing Iraqi forces how to use and maintain the equipment, The Washington Post reported at the time.
"Our GPS jammer puts all U.S. high-precision weapons out of order," Antonov said. "They have turned billions of dollars that the U.S. government has spent into dust."
Antonov denied that his company delivered any equipment directly to Saddam Hussein but acknowledged it might have reached Iraq via arms dealers.
"Right before the war, there were a lot of people in Moscow with suitcases full of money shopping for anything that could deter U.S. troops," Antonov Aviakonversia now manufactures its gear outside Russia so as not to irritate the authorities, he said, though he declined to specify where. He also refused to identify his clients, saying only that they were foreign governments that acquired the jammers through middlemen.
The German peacekeeping contingent in Afghanistan recently sent Aviakonversia a letter thanking it for the jammers, which it deployed to interfere with GPS receivers used by Taliban fighters, Antonov said.
After Aviakonversia first displayed its wares at MAKS 1997, the Pentagon acquired a few dozen jammers, Antonov said.
"Then they went quiet."
A hubbub ensued, however, in the first days of hostilities, when U.S. forces had difficulty in honing in on their targets. Bush reportedly picked up the phone to voice concern to President Vladimir Putin that Iraqi forces were using Russian-made night-vision goggles, GPS jammers and anti-tank Antonov lamented that his company did not reap more praise back home.
A representative of state-owned Phazotron-NIIR, the maker of radars for fighter jets, also said Friday that their stand had been rigorously inspected by the export control service.
Some weapons systems -- such as the S-400 air defense system -- were not even displayed at MAKS, despite previous advertisements.
The main innovation on display at MAKS was the MiG-29OVT with all-axis thrust vector-controlled engines that allow for greater maneuverability at low speeds.
Irkut Corp. demonstrated its innovative unmanned aerial vehicles for civilian use, with the Emergency Situations Ministry likely to be its first

Meth is not fundamentally that different from Sudafed,
and the nasty chemical processes of extracting the sugar coating
and filler material and moving around a couple of methyl and hydroxy groups
and disposing of the bodies of the people you thought were ratting you out
to the police and the space alien biker gangs could all be avoided
if you could make it legally at a big pharma company.
Before the War on Drugs started helping us by making Sudafed hard to get,
the generic pills tended to be on sale for about ten cents per 30mg dose.
If I'm reading Erowid correctly, and guessing the kinds of quantities
a tweaker might use if it were readily available and nearly free,
a buck or two a day would cover all the meth you could use,
and you could easily make that much at a minimum-wage job in the
extra hours you've got that you used to waste sleeping,
and you wouldn't have to resort to crime unless it seemed like more fun.
Also, you could use somewhat calmer amphetamine relatives instead of meth;
can't be *that* much nastier than tobacco, and much of the cost of
legal pharmaceutical amphetamines today is the DEA paperwork.
Opiates are another drug for which crime would be unnecessary
if the stuff were legal.  The last time I got codeine for dental work,
I think I spent about $5 for 20-30 pills.   That's enough for a day of
Rush-Limbaugh-quantity abuse, and enough for a couple of days' worth
of withdrawal-prevention for an average addict,
and stronger opiates are similar in cost; opiate addiction
doesn't need to be as expensive as tobacco addiction.
By the way, if you've watched the TV medical drama "House",
the star is an acerbic doctor who's addicted to Vicodin,
as an after-effect of leg injury, and it's interesting to see the
wall of political correctness cracking a bit.

While the US certainly has been interfering with Chavez
and generally trying to mess around in Venezuela for a while,
most of what's happening here is just that
Chavez is running off at the mouth for domestic political reasons.
(Pat Robertson was partly doing that also and partly just babbling.)
Chavez is a leftist military strongman type, which in Latin America
means he doesn't have a bleeding clue about economic reality,
but has made enough good speeches about bread and circuses
to get elected and stay in office for a few years,
especially if he can avoid trashing oil production
as badly as his corrupt predecessors did
(not that he hasn't been trying to mess that up too.)
The business about shipping oil to Jamaica is interesting;
he'd previously been talking about selling cheap gasoline
to poor US communities, which was high-grade political bullshit
that he had no mechanism for implementing, and quite amusing.
But fundamentally the US government's problem is that he's a leftist
who hangs out with Castro and has oil and likes to do
"land reform" and nationalize oil companies,
which is not the kind of thing that right-wing industrialists like.

The US government can't find where the billions of dollars

But anybody supporting anybody accused of being

That's the sort of thing that the Bush Administration asserts is perfectly ok,

@_subject: [IP] more on Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts 
Neil Munro missed the basic trick that the Bush Administration has
done here.
Because of extensive previous abuse, Congress banned the NSA and CIA
spying on Americans - they're limited to spying on foreigners,
while the FBI and other law enforcement agencies are the only ones
who can normally spy on Americans and are subject to Constitutional
like getting warrants for specific searches.
The Patriot Act and CALEA let the FBI expand their powers significantly,
with tools such as roving wiretaps,
but there's still some semblance of court supervision.
To accommodate problems like foreign spies talking to Americans,
the FISA courts are a court system that operates in secrecy and
can issue warrants based on classified information,
which allow the intelligence agencies to do specific kinds of spying
and wiretapping within the US.  In theory, this provides some kind of
independent Constitutional adult supervision; in practice it's a
rubber stamp,
and the only case in which they're publicly known to have refused a
was in the Wen Ho Lee witchhunt after it had become political.
What the Bush Administration has changed is get its lawyers to say that
the post-9/11 resolutions let them avoid even this level of supervision,
letting the NSA wiretap inside the US without any warrants at all,
and as far as I can tell from the NYT article, without notifying the
FISA courts after they've started to keep records and possibly be
to turn the wiretap back off if the court disagreed with them.
If this were simply a matter of speed, because half a day's delay in
getting a warrant approved would interfere with their work,
they could do that much - this is a major change in character.
It's shameful that the New York Times sat on the story for a year -
and if this were a legitimate activity, the Bush Administration wouldn't
have pressured them into suppressing it that long.
In separate news,  ,
NBC reports that the Defense Department is back to spying on Americans,
specifically anti-war groups and campaigns against military recruiting,
especially suspicious groups associating with Quakers.
They got busted for this back during the Vietnam war,
and were supposed to have stopped,
but they're doing it again in ways that appear to be
violating the rules for data collection that were imposed on them
and are clearly inappropriate in a free society.
And the EU just voted to impose extensive data collection and retention
requirements on ISPs and telcos, in ways that negate many previous
European data privacy laws, as yet another reminder that
when civil rights are protected by laws, that's only good until
the laws are changed or the government starts disobeying them.
It's time to get PGP working again  (originally written for
anti-nuclear groups who were being surveilled),
give some more money to the EFF, get back to Quaker Meeting,
and find ways to replace an Administration that thinks the
Constitution is "just a goddamned piece of paper."
Do please read the 42nd paragraph of the NYT story;
".....law enforcement and intelligence officials are still required to
seek a F.I.S.A. warrant every time they want to eavesdrop within the
United States. A recent agreement reached by Republican leaders and the
Bush administration would modify the standard for F.B.I. wiretap
warrants, requiring, for instance, a description of a specific target.
Critics say the bar would remain too low to prevent abuses."
So, as far as I can see, what's being targeted are international calls
to or from known foreign terrorists (that are not yet covered by US
civil rights laws) that mention, begin or end at U.S. persons.
The CIA/FBI intelligence-take would drop if they had to get a judge's
approval every time an AL-Q guy called up a new number for a brief phone
call in the US. If this was the norm, then traditional eavesdropping on
Atta would have been very unlikely, as he would have been able to use
different street phones every time he called home. If voters want to
accept that trade-off, Congress will give it to them.

Hi, Brock, Dave - the URL lost a hyphen when it got folded;
the two halves are:
Meanwhile, not only is this yet another reminder of the
fallacy of the right-wing rants about liberal press bias,
but President Bush has been asserting that he's told
Congress a dozen times that he's doing this,
and none of the Congresscritters who were informed
have seen fit to tell the public either,
so the President and NYTimes have a lot of
unindicted co-conspirators.
Another LA Times story
reports that the main difference between Bush's authorization
and the powers already granted under the 1978 FISA laws
is that FISA has the Constitutional requirement for
a court to find "probable cause" for issuing warrants,
while Bush's order allows an NSA shift supervisor
to decide there's "a reasonable basis" for wiretapping,
even if there's not enough evidence for a FISC rubber stamp.

The NYT updates us on a favorite cryptographers' hideout....
February 27, 2005
HIGH LOW
High: Anguilla on $1000 a Day
By JULIET MACUR
N hour after arriving on Anguilla in early January, I was soaking in the
hot tub at an exclusive resort, sunglasses on, eyes closed, sun warming my
pasty Northeastern face.
Ah, Anguilla, a quiet island that has recently become "the next St.
Barts," a hedonistic hideaway and magnet for members of the boldface set.
At the northeast corner of this narrow isle, Jennifer Aniston and Brad
Pitt spent New Year's in a villa on Captain's Bay. On its southwestern
coast, Jay-Z and Beyonci had cuddled on the sands of Shoal Bay West. Down
the beach from my resort, Uma Thurman had kicked back at a local bar.
Just as I began to imagine that I, too, was a star on an
escape-the-paparazzi trip, reality interrupted. A foreign object crashed
into my hot tub and sent water slapping against my face. A small boy and
his father were throwing a ball wildly.
The father's next toss bounced off the boy's head and against a woman's
forehead. The father laughed. The woman smiled. I growled and thought,
"This doesn't happen to Jennifer Aniston."
I left in a huff because I had no time for distractions. This was serious
business: I had to figure out how to get by on $1,000 a day.
Related Feature
Low: Anguilla on $250 a Day
Though Anguilla is a relatively undeveloped island where goats might
outnumber residents, $1,000 a day at a chic resort amounts to roughing it.
At the Cap Juluca resort, the cheapest room in high season cost $936 a
night, including the 20 percent tax. Malliouhana Hotel offered a garden
view room on the first floor for $744.
If my best friend, Rose, and I were to eat, drink and even think of going
to the spa on my $1,000-a-day budget, the only high-end resort I could
afford was the CuisinArt Resort and Spa, which sits near the island's
southwestern end on Rendezvous Bay's beach, one and a half miles of
flour-soft sand, blindingly white.
The turquoise ocean water was as clear as Evian, and you could see fish
near the sea floor. The cheapest rate, $550 plus $110 tax - but including
Continental breakfast - would allow us to pretend we belonged at this
beautiful place.
The resort's grounds were simple and elegant. Eggplant-colored
bougainvillea climbed the whitewashed stucco buildings that looked as if
they had been plucked from a Greek cliff. In a nearby garden were trees
heavy with guavas, fig bananas and star apples.
As we looked from the lobby onto a series of rectangular pools cascading
to the beach, a receptionist said we had been upgraded from the main house
to a suite in one of the 10 three-story villas clustered along the shore.
"We hope you don't mind," she said, unaware that I was a journalist.
No, we didn't, and certainly not after seeing the room. The upgrade, to a
junior suite that would have cost $120 more a night, allowed us to hear
waves from our patio.
Our "suite" was a cheery, not fancy, single room, but at 920 square feet
was nearly as big as my Manhattan apartment. A navy couch broke up the
space into sleeping and lounging areas. Two double beds with wicker
headboards faced the porch and a walkway to the beach. Paintings of Greek
fishing villages and bright bedspreads splashed color against the white
walls and tile floors.
A brochure called the bathroom "your own private sanctum," large enough
for an oval tub for a honeymooning couple's bubble bath. But nothing was
that private, considering one wall was made of warped glass. While on the
outside walkway one day, I gasped when I saw a fuzzy version of Rose
heading for the shower.
At the resort's free reception on our first night (with food and drink),
the manager, Rabin Ortiz, told us, "Do not make plans for your weekend."
We quickly learned why. There are no plans to make because, on Anguilla,
there is basically nothing to do. And that's the point.
At CuisinArt, stay away from the main pool (where ball-tossing children
congregate). Instead, sit on the beach and take delivery of homemade lemon
sorbet from waiters whose goal is to fill you with fruity rum drinks.
After sundown, submit to spa treatments like the Anguillan coconut
pineapple scrub, which smells good enough to eat, and the hydroponic
cucumber and aloe wrap, using ingredients grown on the premises.
It was the perfect place for us: upscale, but not one bit snooty.
Night life is minimal. (At 10:30 on Saturday night, only one couple was at
our resort's bar, where a trio sang "Endless Love.") Sea kayaks,
sailboats, catamarans and tennis courts were available and mostly unused.
For casino or dance club action, it's a half-hour ferry ride to St.
Still, after too many games of boccie and gin rummy - or perhaps not
enough gin and rum - we searched for some fun. Down the beach was Dune
Preserve, a delightfully mellow bar inside a wooden shack owned by the
local reggae legend Bankie Banx. A CuisinArt bartender said that Uma had
been there the night before.
We followed the shoreline to get there. But then, as if the local gods
ordered punishment for all $1,000-a-day cheapskates, two stray dogs
charged us in the darkness. We couldn't see them, but they barked and
snapped like rabid Rottweilers, sending us running back to CuisinArt. So
much for Uma.
Cowards that we were, we rented a car the next day for $55 (including $20
for an Anguillan license) and that night drove 60 seconds to Dune
Preserve, only to realize we were too full for a drink. Because, on
Anguilla, what you do is eat - often.
Our gluttony had begun at Santorini, which, like CuisinArt's other
heavenly restaurant, Cafe Mediterraneo, uses food grown in the resort's
high-tech hydroponic garden or its old-school organic one. There, Rose and
I went to a class led by CuisinArt's executive chef, Daniel Orr, formerly
a chef at Guastavino's in New York City.
Neither of us is a great cook. (My fridge at home contains two bottles of
seltzer, nail polish and AA batteries.) But we are great eaters. We
stuffed ourselves with a tangy serving of stingray, a dizzyingly delicious
chocolate souffli and yellow lentil bisque so good we were tempted to lick
our bowls.
Afterward, I was shocked at the $75 charge, well over the advertised $55 I
had budgeted (it had just gone up). I next heard my whiny voice telling
the concierge:
"You don't understand. I cannot afford this extra $20."
The concierge rolled her eyes, but, hey, I needed $110 for the seaweed
scrub later.
That evening, we took a cab ($13 each way) to dinner at Blanchard's, a
top-notch restaurant in a quaint cottage. Most of the 23 tables were
arranged on the main floor, but we sat on a lower patio overlooking
fountains and gardens and the sea beyond. The only disappointments were
the rubbery lobster included in the $56 Caribbean Sampler and the waiters'
rushing us through the meal. Total for my dinner: $110.40.
Perhaps the management could sense that we were not the stars of our
imaginations. I asked the man at the bar if any real stars came in. He
reeled off names of those who had been there "just yesterday": Denzel
Washington. Johnny Damon. Liam Neeson and his wife, Natasha Richardson.
Courteney Cox Arquette. And, of course, Jennifer Aniston.
The next day, though it was dry season, it poured. So on that rainy Sunday
we rented a car and checked out Anguilla, which didn't take long. It is
only about 16 miles long and 3 miles wide. We found it pleasingly devoid
of cheesy T-shirt shops and fast-food joints but plentiful with
road-roaming goats and the smiling people who own them.
We lunched at Gorgeous Scilly Cay, a primitive restaurant on a tiny island
off the northeastern coast. With no electricity, it's open only from 11
a.m. to 5 p.m. To get there, you stand on a dock and hail a boatman.
Normally, patrons sun themselves there on lounge chairs between courses,
and get foot rubs from the restaurant's masseur, said the owner, Sandra
Wallace. But not on this rainy day. On the boat over with us, she wore a
garbage bag to stay dry; the masseur stayed home.
Still, a calypso band played upbeat music in the main house, which had
about a dozen tables and was open on all sides. Outside, there were
several palm-covered huts, each with a few plastic tables and chairs,
where I ordered the crayfish and chicken plate for $45, as sweet as their
rum punch was dangerous. My lunch, with tip, came to $74.
We found no famous people there, either - we were managing to repel them -
though we did hear that Sharon Stone had recently rented out the whole
island. And Jennifer Aniston (her again) had been there the week before.
That evening, I had my second treatment at the Venus Spa - a place without
much character or Zen - at CuisinArt. (In the thumbnail-size locker room,
I awkwardly rubbed elbows with someone's naked grandmother.) The Caribbean
warm stone massage ($115, plus $22 tip) was a step up from the seaweed
wrap of the day before - better called the seaweed chill.
That one began with me shivering in the treatment room. The masseuse said,
"If I told them once, I told them 20 times, this room is freezing."
Then she spread cold seaweed gook over my goose bumps. I groaned while she
mummified me with towels. Under those coverings, wrapped inside foil, I
felt like a hypothermia patient.
But relief came with the warm stone massage. As the smooth rocks rolled
over my muscles it felt oddly soothing, as if I were being seared by a
giant stick of roll-on deodorant. I felt so much at ease that later I
splurged on a smoothie for Rose, at $8.05 the only thing I could afford to
buy her all weekend.
When the sun came out on our last day, I passed the hot tub and saw that
same annoying family with their dreaded ball, this time being tossed
between two strollers. So I headed for the beach.
I bobbed around the water for a while, then moved my peaceful self to a
lounge chair. There I sipped on my own smoothie until it was time to get
back to the real world by way of the St. Martin airport.
At a terminal newsstand, I finally saw Jennifer Aniston - on a magazine
cover. How terrible - her Anguillan experience included suffering greater
than my seaweed chill - she and Brad had broken up.
"Hey lady!" the cashier yelled. "Did you see the sign? You can't read the
magazines until you buy them!"
What, she thought I looked rich? I had already spent my $2,000. So I
dropped the $3.95 magazine onto the shelf and walked away.

HIGH LOW
High: Anguilla on $1000 a Day
By JULIET MACUR
N hour after arriving on Anguilla in early January, I was soaking in the
hot tub at an exclusive resort, sunglasses on, eyes closed, sun warming my
pasty Northeastern face.
Ah, Anguilla, a quiet island that has recently become "the next St.
Barts," a hedonistic hideaway and magnet for members of the boldface set.
At the northeast corner of this narrow isle, Jennifer Aniston and Brad
Pitt spent New Year's in a villa on Captain's Bay. On its southwestern
coast, Jay-Z and Beyonci had cuddled on the sands of Shoal Bay West. Down
the beach from my resort, Uma Thurman had kicked back at a local bar.
Just as I began to imagine that I, too, was a star on an
escape-the-paparazzi trip, reality interrupted. A foreign object crashed
into my hot tub and sent water slapping against my face. A small boy and
his father were throwing a ball wildly.
The father's next toss bounced off the boy's head and against a woman's
forehead. The father laughed. The woman smiled. I growled and thought,
"This doesn't happen to Jennifer Aniston."
I left in a huff because I had no time for distractions. This was serious
business: I had to figure out how to get by on $1,000 a day.
Related Feature
Low: Anguilla on $250 a Day
Though Anguilla is a relatively undeveloped island where goats might
outnumber residents, $1,000 a day at a chic resort amounts to roughing it.
At the Cap Juluca resort, the cheapest room in high season cost $936 a
night, including the 20 percent tax. Malliouhana Hotel offered a garden
view room on the first floor for $744.
If my best friend, Rose, and I were to eat, drink and even think of going
to the spa on my $1,000-a-day budget, the only high-end resort I could
afford was the CuisinArt Resort and Spa, which sits near the island's
southwestern end on Rendezvous Bay's beach, one and a half miles of
flour-soft sand, blindingly white.
The turquoise ocean water was as clear as Evian, and you could see fish
near the sea floor. The cheapest rate, $550 plus $110 tax - but including
Continental breakfast - would allow us to pretend we belonged at this
beautiful place.
The resort's grounds were simple and elegant. Eggplant-colored
bougainvillea climbed the whitewashed stucco buildings that looked as if
they had been plucked from a Greek cliff. In a nearby garden were trees
heavy with guavas, fig bananas and star apples.
As we looked from the lobby onto a series of rectangular pools cascading
to the beach, a receptionist said we had been upgraded from the main house
to a suite in one of the 10 three-story villas clustered along the shore.
"We hope you don't mind," she said, unaware that I was a journalist.
No, we didn't, and certainly not after seeing the room. The upgrade, to a
junior suite that would have cost $120 more a night, allowed us to hear
waves from our patio.
Our "suite" was a cheery, not fancy, single room, but at 920 square feet
was nearly as big as my Manhattan apartment. A navy couch broke up the
space into sleeping and lounging areas. Two double beds with wicker
headboards faced the porch and a walkway to the beach. Paintings of Greek
fishing villages and bright bedspreads splashed color against the white
walls and tile floors.
A brochure called the bathroom "your own private sanctum," large enough
for an oval tub for a honeymooning couple's bubble bath. But nothing was
that private, considering one wall was made of warped glass. While on the
outside walkway one day, I gasped when I saw a fuzzy version of Rose
heading for the shower.
At the resort's free reception on our first night (with food and drink),
the manager, Rabin Ortiz, told us, "Do not make plans for your weekend."
We quickly learned why. There are no plans to make because, on Anguilla,
there is basically nothing to do. And that's the point.
At CuisinArt, stay away from the main pool (where ball-tossing children
congregate). Instead, sit on the beach and take delivery of homemade lemon
sorbet from waiters whose goal is to fill you with fruity rum drinks.
After sundown, submit to spa treatments like the Anguillan coconut
pineapple scrub, which smells good enough to eat, and the hydroponic
cucumber and aloe wrap, using ingredients grown on the premises.
It was the perfect place for us: upscale, but not one bit snooty.
Night life is minimal. (At 10:30 on Saturday night, only one couple was at
our resort's bar, where a trio sang "Endless Love.") Sea kayaks,
sailboats, catamarans and tennis courts were available and mostly unused.
For casino or dance club action, it's a half-hour ferry ride to St.
Still, after too many games of boccie and gin rummy - or perhaps not
enough gin and rum - we searched for some fun. Down the beach was Dune
Preserve, a delightfully mellow bar inside a wooden shack owned by the
local reggae legend Bankie Banx. A CuisinArt bartender said that Uma had
been there the night before.
We followed the shoreline to get there. But then, as if the local gods
ordered punishment for all $1,000-a-day cheapskates, two stray dogs
charged us in the darkness. We couldn't see them, but they barked and
snapped like rabid Rottweilers, sending us running back to CuisinArt. So
much for Uma.
Cowards that we were, we rented a car the next day for $55 (including $20
for an Anguillan license) and that night drove 60 seconds to Dune
Preserve, only to realize we were too full for a drink. Because, on
Anguilla, what you do is eat - often.
Our gluttony had begun at Santorini, which, like CuisinArt's other
heavenly restaurant, Cafe Mediterraneo, uses food grown in the resort's
high-tech hydroponic garden or its old-school organic one. There, Rose and
I went to a class led by CuisinArt's executive chef, Daniel Orr, formerly
a chef at Guastavino's in New York City.
Neither of us is a great cook. (My fridge at home contains two bottles of
seltzer, nail polish and AA batteries.) But we are great eaters. We
stuffed ourselves with a tangy serving of stingray, a dizzyingly delicious
chocolate souffli and yellow lentil bisque so good we were tempted to lick
our bowls.
Afterward, I was shocked at the $75 charge, well over the advertised $55 I
had budgeted (it had just gone up). I next heard my whiny voice telling
the concierge:
"You don't understand. I cannot afford this extra $20."
The concierge rolled her eyes, but, hey, I needed $110 for the seaweed
scrub later.
That evening, we took a cab ($13 each way) to dinner at Blanchard's, a
top-notch restaurant in a quaint cottage. Most of the 23 tables were
arranged on the main floor, but we sat on a lower patio overlooking
fountains and gardens and the sea beyond. The only disappointments were
the rubbery lobster included in the $56 Caribbean Sampler and the waiters'
rushing us through the meal. Total for my dinner: $110.40.
Perhaps the management could sense that we were not the stars of our
imaginations. I asked the man at the bar if any real stars came in. He
reeled off names of those who had been there "just yesterday": Denzel
Washington. Johnny Damon. Liam Neeson and his wife, Natasha Richardson.
Courteney Cox Arquette. And, of course, Jennifer Aniston.
The next day, though it was dry season, it poured. So on that rainy Sunday
we rented a car and checked out Anguilla, which didn't take long. It is
only about 16 miles long and 3 miles wide. We found it pleasingly devoid
of cheesy T-shirt shops and fast-food joints but plentiful with
road-roaming goats and the smiling people who own them.
We lunched at Gorgeous Scilly Cay, a primitive restaurant on a tiny island
off the northeastern coast. With no electricity, it's open only from 11
a.m. to 5 p.m. To get there, you stand on a dock and hail a boatman.
Normally, patrons sun themselves there on lounge chairs between courses,
and get foot rubs from the restaurant's masseur, said the owner, Sandra
Wallace. But not on this rainy day. On the boat over with us, she wore a
garbage bag to stay dry; the masseur stayed home.
Still, a calypso band played upbeat music in the main house, which had
about a dozen tables and was open on all sides. Outside, there were
several palm-covered huts, each with a few plastic tables and chairs,
where I ordered the crayfish and chicken plate for $45, as sweet as their
rum punch was dangerous. My lunch, with tip, came to $74.
We found no famous people there, either - we were managing to repel them -
though we did hear that Sharon Stone had recently rented out the whole
island. And Jennifer Aniston (her again) had been there the week before.
That evening, I had my second treatment at the Venus Spa - a place without
much character or Zen - at CuisinArt. (In the thumbnail-size locker room,
I awkwardly rubbed elbows with someone's naked grandmother.) The Caribbean
warm stone massage ($115, plus $22 tip) was a step up from the seaweed
wrap of the day before - better called the seaweed chill.
That one began with me shivering in the treatment room. The masseuse said,
"If I told them once, I told them 20 times, this room is freezing."
Then she spread cold seaweed gook over my goose bumps. I groaned while she
mummified me with towels. Under those coverings, wrapped inside foil, I
felt like a hypothermia patient.
But relief came with the warm stone massage. As the smooth rocks rolled
over my muscles it felt oddly soothing, as if I were being seared by a
giant stick of roll-on deodorant. I felt so much at ease that later I
splurged on a smoothie for Rose, at $8.05 the only thing I could afford to
buy her all weekend.
When the sun came out on our last day, I passed the hot tub and saw that
same annoying family with their dreaded ball, this time being tossed
between two strollers. So I headed for the beach.
I bobbed around the water for a while, then moved my peaceful self to a

According to an article in The Register, Overpeer is spreading
adware-infected Windows Media Audio and Windows Media Video files via P2P.
PC World Magazine did some research, ran Etherpeek, and found that
the adware was going to Overpeer, which is owned by Loudeye,
who strongly defend the practice, saying music pirates deserve what they get.
Of course, what the article isn't mentioning is that
this means that the WMA and WMV file formats have features
that can be used with the Windows Media Player to support adware,
so a good chunk of the blame belongs back in Redmond.
(Remind me again why closed-source DRMware is a good idea?)
Now, it wouldn't bother me if the Windows Media Player's
silly trippy visuals that you get when playing audio
that doesn't have a video track were replaced by
some advertising video, as long as it's all self-contained
and doesn't phone home to tell advertisers what I'm listening to.
But this one seems to be pretty chatty.

Do you mean that if you discover an unsolicited gift of

do you have the right to play with it just as you would if
it came in the mail?  I would certainly expect so...
On the other hand, if it appears to be a lost item,
you could be a good public citizen and take it to the police
to see if anybody claims it...
"GPS tracker" is an ambiguous description, though.
GPS devices detect where they are, but what next?
A device could record where it was, for later collection,
or it could transmit its position to a listener.
Tampering with existing recordings might have legal
implications, but putting a transmitter-based system
in your nearest garbage can or accidentally leaving it in a taxi
or mailing it to Medellin all seem like reasonable activities.

@_subject: Police Worried About New Vest-Penetrating Gun 
A couple of questions to the gunpunks out there...
I've heard that rifles easily penetrate bullet-proof vests,
and that vests are really only useful against average-to-small handguns
and against shotguns.  Is this accurate?
Any idea how much you can saw off a rifle
and still have it penetrate typical cop vests?
(And I assume the "20 rounds in seconds" is just a scary way to say
"it has a big magazine and you have to pull the trigger 20 times".)
Also, the police expressed worry that criminals might hear about
these guns and then the cops would be in big trouble.
Sounds silly to me - while some criminals might buy a
"cop-killer handgun" for bragging rights,
random criminals presumably only buy weapons useful for the
scenarios they imagine being in,
which is Saturday Night Specials for most applications,
or whatever currently fashionable Mac10/Uzi/etc.
for druglord armies that expect to be shooting at each other,
or rifles for distance work and dual-use pickup-truck decoration.
Do many criminals expect to initiate shootouts with vest-wearing cops
in scenarios where a rifle isn't practical?
Do most cops wear bullet-proof vests regularly other than in
holdup/hostage SWAT situations, where the criminal might have rifles anyway,
and where a regular pistol is just fine for shooting hostages?
Or is this mainly a problem for the cases when cops want to stage
military-style pre-dawn assaults on people's houses,
where they expect that the targets usually only have
pistols handy near the bed and don't have time for rifles?
Seems like scare-mongering to me, not a practical concern.

@_subject: US slaps on the wardriver-busting paint 
You weren't reading the "how it works" description carefully.
It works by blocking RF, so if you put enough paint on to block
outgoing RF from your IF oscillator, you'll also block
incoming RF headed for your tuner, unless your TV set
does a good job of isolating the IF from the antenna.
Similarly, if it's doing a good enough job of blocking RF
to keep 802.11 WLANs from getting out, it's also keeping
cell phone signals from getting in.
RF is surprisingly leaky stuff.  Back when I ran a
TEMPEST-shielded room, we'd find easily-measurable leaks
if the copper-wool filler in the joints wasn't packed tightly,
or if we stuck a paper clip in one of the fiber-waveguide holes.
We were measuring at 450 MHz, which was a really high frequency
for the mid 1980s when computers ran at 10 MHz,
and our room was about 120 dB tight when everything was working.
Looks like the tax is UKP 116, so if the paint is only sold
in whole gallons, and the white vans come around monthly to test,
it could pay off in 3-4 months if it worked, except that
it probably won't work.

Fox News Story:
Drug Rocket Fails to Take Off
Tuesday, July 05, 2005
Drug dealing really may be rocket science.
Two accused methamphetamine traffickers apparently rigged up their car so that if cops closed in, a small rocket carrying their stash would pop up from the trunk and launch itself far from the long arm of the law.
For some reason, the rocket never achieved liftoff when Missouri State Highway Patrol (search) officers pulled over Michael Ray Sullivan, 41, and Joseph C. Seidl, 39, both of Kentucky, on June 24 in Kingdom City.
The $13,534 in cash in the 1990 Ford Thunderbird was interesting enough, Kansas City U.S. Attorney's Office spokesman Don Ledford told the Columbia (Mo.) Daily Tribune.
Far more intriguing was what was in the trunk: three dud pipe bombs and a "hobby-style" rocket, three to four feet long, all packed with meth worth up to $145,000.
Ledford explained that a web of ropes and pulleys lifted the rocket into launch position when the trunk lid was opened. The rocket could then be ignited from inside the car using the dashboard cigarette lighter.
Cops are pretty certain the rocket was meant to be an escape pod for the drugs, but Ledford diplomatically declined to speculate.
"But they did have the meth inside the rocket," he admitted, "and it could be launched from inside the car."

I haven't found anybody that'll take credit cards or paypal

there's too much risk of fraud including reneging on credit card charges.
However, I've been very pleased with Goldage.net -
they've got several mechanisms for paying them,
including walking in to one of half a dozen major US banks
and making a deposit to their account,
as well as a few varieties of wire transfer.
They're a transaction-based service rather than an account-based service,
and support a variety of online gold currencies.
I don't use e-gold myself - I get so much spam purporting to be
from them that it's much simpler to discard all of it,
since 99.9% is phishing.  But a certain anonymous person
with whom I might or might not be be familiar was able to
use Goldage's online interface to set up a transaction,
hand some dead presidents to a Bank that's in America,
and a day or two later the transaction cleared and
there was a deposit to an electronic currency company's account,
which could allegedly be used to pay a merchant.
Fees were pretty low, though for relatively small transactions
the minimum fee is the main concern, rather than the
percentages that matter more on larger transactions.

California's medical marijuana laws allow you to use it for
just about any "medical condition" you can get a doctor to
prescribe it for, and there are doctors happy to oblige.
This set of mostly really bad decisions by the Supremes
is really stressing me out, so I'd better go get something to
help me manage the stress :-)
Eminent Domain decision looks really bad, though I haven't read it yet.
Brad Templeton suggested, though, that the Constitution does still
require just compensation, and that the obvious value of the
property that's taken is not just the value that the
property owner would have taken if he felt like moving out
and selling to another homeowner,
but the value that the private company would have had to pay
to get everybody they're stealing land from to sell out.
So it may still be possible to get paid decently by going to court.
The Medical Marijuana decision, while appallingly bad,
seemed pretty obvious - straight stare decisis from the
FDR-era decision that a farmer growing grain on his own land
to feed to his own hogs was still engaged in interstate commerce,
and therefore subject to FDR's agriculture quasi-nationalization rules.
If the Supremes had wanted to overturn that, they could have
done so (unlikely), or they could have decided that the case
was sufficiently different because it's about medicine and
not just commerce (also unlikely), but they didn't.
That's a problem with activist lawsuits - you need to have
the resources to win, or else you usually end up making the
legal situation worse for everybody than if you hadn't done it.
At first glance, the cable modem decision looks right, though;

More news dispatches from Brinworld....
Bootfinder, made by G2 Systems in Alexandria VA,
is a combination of a handheld digital camera,
OCR software for locating and reading license plates,
and a database lookup system that shows the user
whatever information it has about that license plate.
The software runs on a laptop; the article doesn't say
if it has an online live data feed or just runs on stored data.
The two governments currently using it, New Haven Conn
and Arlington County VA, are using it to find
car tax and parking ticket delinquents,
so it's something that doesn't need a live data feed,
but that would be easy to patch on - the hard technology's
in reading the number, not in using it.
It was originally developed for tracing stolen cars,
but the developer found that to be a hard sell with
cash-strapped police departments, while parking enforcement
is a revenue-generating activity so anything that
lets those departments rake in money faster is an easy sell.
One city saw their car tax payment compliance go from
80% to 95% because it was easy to catch many non-payers
and to scare other people into paying before they get caught.
The camera can scan 1000 license plates per minute -
the article doesn't say how fast the cars can be going,
but the cities that use it have parking officials driving
down the street scanning parked cars' plates,
which are easier to aim at than moving cars.
Even so, that suggests that more widespread privacy-invading
applications should be easy to develop -
David Brin's "Transparent Society" prediction of
cameras and computing being cheap enough to become ubiquitous
becomes more realistic every year.

EFF's DESCrack cost $200K in 1998 and used ASICs.
(It's really only six years since we killed off single-DES!)
There were 1500 DES-cracker ASIC chips in it.
ASICs may cost a bit more today - Moore's Law helps,
but it also means that chip designs can become
larger and more complex, though code-cracker applications
have a lot of uniformity in their design,
and we've got six more years of experience
building ASIC cell libraries that can be reused.
I suspect a similar-sized machine would cost a similar amount
but have a lot more DES functional units in it.
FPGAs probably make more sense for routers,
because you want the ability to change the firmware more often,
and a router has a bunch of other parts as well,
and realistically, cypher-cracking is not an
economically viable activity for most people,
so the cost-benefit tradeoffs are a bit twisted.

It's a harder problem than you'd expect -
Wifi doesn't have a long range, so you have to detect the hotspot,
decide if you can handle or evade its authentication, do that,
and then send your message before you've driven out of range.
If you're in range for 100 meters at a 18kph city crawl (or bike)
that's about 5 meters/sec so you've got 20 seconds, and it can work.
If you're driving 90kph and catch 10 meters of the edge of a range,
you've got 0.4 seconds to do the job, which is pretty dodgy -
lots of mail servers take a few seconds to really sync up,
especially if you've got to do a DNS lookup or two.
Directional Antennas are unlikely to be useful -
if you've got them aimed right, you might win,
but you're much more likely to miss entirely
or have only a few meters that you're in range.

Official Reveals Budget for U.S. Intelligence
By SCOTT SHANE
WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 - In an apparent slip, a top American intelligence official has revealed at a public conference what has long been secret: the amount of money the United States spends on its spy agencies.
At an intelligence conference in San Antonio last week, Mary Margaret Graham, a 27-year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency and now the deputy director of national intelligence for collection, said the annual intelligence budget was $44 billion.
The number was reported Monday in U.S. News and World Report, whose national security reporter, Kevin Whitelaw, was among the hundreds of people in attendance during Ms. Graham's talk.
"I thought, 'I can't believe she said that,' " Mr. Whitelaw said on Monday. "The government has spent so much time and energy arguing that it needs to remain classified."
The figure itself comes as no great shock; most news reports in the last couple of years have estimated the budget at $40 billion. But the fact that Ms. Graham would say it in public is a surprise, because the government has repeatedly gone to court to keep the current intelligence budget and even past budgets as far back as the 1940's from being disclosed.
Carl Kropf, a spokesman for the office of the director of national intelligence, John D. Negroponte, said Ms. Graham would not comment. Mr. Kropf declined to say whether the figure, which Ms. Graham gave last Monday at an annual conference on intelligence gathered from satellite and other photographs, was accurate, or whether her revelation was accidental.
Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, expressed amused satisfaction that the budget figure had slipped out.
"It is ironic," Mr. Aftergood said. "We sued the C.I.A. four times for this kind of information and lost. You can't get it through legal channels."
Only for a few past years has the budget been disclosed. After Mr. Aftergood's group first sued for the budget figure under the Freedom of Information Act in 1997, George J. Tenet, then the director of central intelligence, decided to make public that year's budget, $26.6 billion. The next year Mr. Tenet did the same, revealing that the 1998 fiscal year budget was $26.7 billion.
But in 1999, Mr. Tenet reversed that policy, and budgets since then have remained classified with the support of the courts. Last year, a federal judge refused to order the C.I.A. to release its budget totals for 1947 to 1970 - except for the 1963 budget, which Mr. Aftergood showed had already been revealed elsewhere.
In court and in response to inquiries, intelligence officials have argued that disclosing the total spying budget would create pressure to reveal more spending details, and that such revelations could aid the nation's That argument has been rejected by many members of Congress and outside experts, who note that most of the Defense Department budget is published in exhaustive detail without evident harm.
The national commission on the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, recommended that both the overall intelligence budget and spending by individual agencies be made public "in order to combat the secrecy and complexity" it found was harming national security.
"The taxpayers deserve to know what they're spending for intelligence," said Lee H. Hamilton, the former congressman who was vice chairman of the Even more important, Mr. Hamilton said, public discussion of the total budgets of intelligence agencies would encourage Congress to exercise "robust oversight."
The debate over whether the intelligence budget should be secret dates to at least the 1970's, said Loch K. Johnson, an intelligence historian who worked for the Church Committee investigation of the intelligence agencies by the Senate in the mid-1970's. Mr. Johnson said the real reason for secrecy might have less to do with protecting intelligence sources and methods than with protecting the bureaucracy.
"Maybe there's a fear that if the American people knew what was being spent on intelligence, they'd be even more upset at intelligence failures," Mr. Johnson said.

On the Effectiveness of Aluminium Foil Helmets:
An Empirical Study
Ali Rahimi1, Ben Recht 2, Jason Taylor 2, Noah Vawter 2
17 Feb 2005
1: Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department, MIT.
2: Media Laboratory, MIT.
Among a fringe community of paranoids, aluminum helmets serve as the protective measure of choice against invasive radio signals. We investigate the efficacy of three aluminum helmet designs on a sample group of four individuals. Using a $250,000 network analyser, we find that although on average all helmets attenuate invasive radio frequencies in either directions (either emanating from an outside source, or emanating from the cranium of the subject), certain frequencies are in fact greatly amplified. These amplified frequencies coincide with radio bands reserved for government use according to the Federal Communication Commission (FCC). Statistical evidence suggests the use of helmets may in fact enhance the government's invasive abilities. We theorize that the government may in fact have started the helmet craze for this reason.
It has long been suspected that the government has been using satellites to read and control the minds of certain citizens. The use of aluminum helmets has been a common guerrilla tactic against the government's invasive tactics [1]. Surprisingly, these helmets can in fact help the government spy on citizens by amplifying certain key frequency ranges reserved for government use. In addition, none of the three helmets we analyzed provided significant attenuation to most frequency bands.
We describe our experimental setup, report our results, and conclude with a few design guidelines for constructing more effective helmets.
Experimental Setup
The three helmet types tested
The ClassicalThe Fez
The Centurion
We evaluated the performance of three different helmet designs, commonly referred to as the Classical, the Fez, and the Centurion. These designs are portrayed in Figure 1. The helmets were made of Reynolds aluminium foil. As per best practices, all three designs were constructed with the double layering technique described elsewhere [2].
A radio-frequency test signal sweeping the ranges from 10 Khz to 3 Ghz was generated using an omnidirectional antenna attached to the Agilent 8714ET's signal generator.
The experimental apparatus, including a data recording laptop, a $250,000 network analyser, and antennae.
A network analyser (Agilent 8714ET) and a directional antenna measured and plotted the signals. See Figure 2.
Because of the cost of the equipment (about $250,000), and the limited time for which we had access to these devices, the subjects and experimenters performed a few dry runs before the actual experiment (see Figure 3).
Test subjects during a dry run.
The receiver antenna was placed at various places on the cranium of 4 different subjects: the frontal, occipital and parietal lobes. Once with the helmet off and once with the helmet on. The network analyzer plotted the attenuation betwen the signals in these two settings at different frequencies, from 10Khz to 3 Ghz. Figure 4 shows a typical plot of the attenuation at different frequencies.
A typical attenuation trace form the network analyser
For all helmets, we noticed a 30 db amplification at 2.6 Ghz and a 20 db amplification at 1.2 Ghz, regardless of the position of the antenna on the cranium. In addition, all helmets exhibited a marked 20 db attenuation at around 1.5 Ghz, with no significant attenuation beyond 10 db anywhere else.
The helmets amplify frequency bands that coincide with those allocated to the US government between 1.2 Ghz and 1.4 Ghz. According to the FCC, These bands are supposedly reserved for ''radio location'' (ie, GPS), and other communications with satellites (see, for example, [3]). The 2.6 Ghz band coincides with mobile phone technology. Though not affiliated by government, these bands are at the hands of multinational corporations.
It requires no stretch of the imagination to conclude that the current helmet craze is likely to have been propagated by the Government, possibly with the involvement of the FCC. We hope this report will encourage the paranoid community to develop improved helmet designs to avoid falling prey to these shortcomings.
The authors would like to thank Andy (Xu) Sun of the MIT Media Lab for helping with the equipment, Professor George Sergiadis for lending us the antennae, and Professor Neil Gershenfeld for allowing us the use of his lab

Steve posted Bruce's reference to an astounding paper.
It's a master's thesis in military history by a US army major,
looking at the John Walker spy case's effects
and the absolutely badly broken US Military systems he was part of -
- the security clearance process was systematically unreliable,
pretty much guaranteeing that there'd be enough bad guys hired
and given access to highly classified information that
you'd expect some of it to get sold to the Soviets,
and they were much more worried that sailors might be gay
than that they might have serious drinking and financial problems
- the radio crypto system he was stealing keys for was used by
the entire US Navy in ways that one person could compromise
the communications for the entire fleet for months, undetected,
- tens of thousands of people had access to the keying material,
- the NSA mostly designed crypto systems with the goal of having them
not be compromised, but the Navy mostly designed operations systems
with the goal of being able to communicate reliably,
- the NSA didn't realize how different the Navy's operations
environment was from how the NSA would run things,
and the Navy didn't realize how critical the handling requirements were,
- Navy classified information storage rooms used to have photocopiers (:-)
- Navy personnel files were accessible to the people they were about,
and one way to renew your security clearance was to create your own paperwork,
- theoretically the Fleet Broadcasting System keying material
was split into four regions of the world to reduce risk of compromise,
but in practice every ship had every set of keys in case they needed them,
- the military in the mid-70s still used some even older NSA systems that
were based on rotor machines, in spite of the fact that
some rotor machines had been cracked as early as the 1930s
(but the Enigma cracking was still secret until 1979,
so security-by-obscurity said this was still ok for most uses),
and the main reason they were phased out was they were too slow,
- hauling keying material around by courier might be ok for an airforce,
but Navy ships move slowly and independently enough that they
tend to haul around huge chunks of keying material,
as well as couriering material for other services.
The author speculates that the Pueblo may have been seized
specifically because the Soviets knew they'd be able to get
keying material from Walker and wanted to get the crypto machine,
and that they later cracked the machine so they no longer needed new keys.
Walker's access to couriered keying material appears to have
exposed much of the Vietnam War B-52 bombing plans to the Soviets,
so the North Vietnamese and Vietcong could avoid being in the
places that the US was bombing for several years.
"Breaking the Ring" was a book about the Walker spy ring
and its effects, and Heath discusses a few items from it that
she thinks were probably deception by various players.
There's a little bit of technical detail, mostly not that deep,
but enough to let the reader understand the impacts of various
technologies and decisions, like the risks of having
tens of thousands of sailors having access to material
that can compromise the communications of the entire fleet.
The NSA used to not only pretend not to exist, but also pretended
to have the best crypto people in the world,
and while they may have had the best codebreakers,
it clearly wasn't having much effect on their codemaking side
as late as the mid-70s - and while public-key crypto wasn't
very practical in 1976 when Diffie-Hellman was first published,
it was apparently desperately needed, and the Navy would
probably have better off with DES than with much of what they
were using back then.
Were the mid-70s really that long ago?
Was the security clearance system that incompetent
back when I had mine (:-)?

Deputy Police Chief Frank Fernandez said officers might, for example, surround a bank building, check the IDs of everyone going in and out and hand out leaflets about terror threats.
"This is an in-your-face type of strategy. It's letting the terrorists know we are out there," Fernandez said.
The operations will keep terrorists off guard, Fernandez said. He said al-Qaida and other terrorist groups plot attacks by putting places under surveillance and watching for flaws and patterns in security.
Police Chief John Timoney said there was no specific, credible threat of an imminent terror attack in Miami. But he said the city has repeatedly been mentioned in intelligence reports as a potential target.
Timoney also noted that 14 of the 19 hijackers who took part in the Sept. 11 attacks lived in South Florida at various times and that other alleged terror cells have operated in the area.
Both uniformed and plainclothes police will ride buses and trains, while others will conduct longer-term surveillance operations.
"People are definitely going to notice it," Fernandez said. "We want that shock. We want that awe. But at the same time, we don't want people to feel their rights are being threatened. We need them to be our eyes and ears."
Howard Simon, executive director of ACLU of Florida, said the Miami initiative appears aimed at ensuring that people's rights are not violated.
"What we're dealing with is officers on street patrol, which is more effective and more consistent with the Constitution," Simon said. "We'll have to see how it is implemented."
Mary Ann Viverette, president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, said the Miami program is similar to those used for years during the holiday season to deter criminals at busy places such as shopping malls.
"You want to make your presence known and that's a great way to do it," said Viverette, police chief in Gaithersburg, Md. "We want people to feel they can go about their normal course of business, but we want them to be ) Copyright 2005 The New York Times Company

@_subject: Multiple passports? 
When I saw the title of this thread,
I was assuming it would be about getting Mozambique
or Sealand or other passports of convenience or coolness-factor
like the Old-School Cypherpunks used to do :-)
A few years ago, before heading on an overseas trip,
I was unable to locate my current passport.
After dealing with a voicemail system adapted from a Kafka novel,
and bringing myself, my previous expired passport and other id,
a couple official-sized photographs and cash through the
secret-handshake elevator into a big waiting room for a long morning,
they made me a new passport.   (If you need to replace a passport
more than a month before your planned travel,
you're supposed to use the regular process at the Post Office
and maybe pay extra for Express Mail if you're impatient.
If you need to replace a passport within 3 days of travel,
they've got expedited processes at major passport offices like San Francisco.
But if you need to replace your passport two weeks before the trip,
there's no way to talk to a human being, just Kafka's voicemailbot,
so you have to wait until 3 days before the trip
to get an appointment for the emergency expedited process
instead of going in when you and they aren't busy :-)
They informed me that the lost passport was now invalid
and I should turn it in if I find it, because if I were to use it
to get back into the country it would be rejected with extreme prejudice,
since its number is now on the "lost passports" list.
Of course the next day when I was packing,
the passport showed up on the closet floor under the suitcase,
and unlike the previous passport which I took in to replace
when it was about to expire, it doesn't have holes
punched in it and Expired stamped on it.
For domestic air travel since the recent military coup,
I normally bring a passport as ID, since it's a request from the
former United States government asking foreign governments
like the current TSA White People to let me pass,
and I'd rather carry the technically-invalid one with me
instead of the valid one just in case I lose it.
I think I've also used it to travel from the EU back to the US,
but I'd expect that the La Migra thugs will
eventually improve their databases, possibly even before my old one expires,
especially because Homeland Security wants to RFIDize us.
I was considering "losing" my current passport before the
RFID things get started, but it doesn't look like there's time,
so I've got about 5 years to hope that the Republicans get
thrown out on their asses in the next election and the
Democrats decide that returning to the Constitution will sell better
than continuing the Permanent State of Yellowalertness.
Given the previous Clinton Administration's behavior,
I don't expect the Hillary Clinton Administration to do any better.
I don't think the US normally lets you have two passports,
or if they do they almost certainly have the same number.
But at least during the 1980s, Israel would be happy to give you
a separate piece of paper with to carry with your passport that
they'd stamp when you entered and left instead of stamping the
passport itself.  I don't remember if I did that or if I decided
not to worry about it because I'd visited the Arab countries
before going to Israel and didn't expect to get back any time soon.

They've said they'll fall back on the traditional
"If we can't read the passport it's invalid and you'll need to
replace it before we'll let you leave the country" technique,
just as they often do with expired passports and sometimes
do with just-about-to-expire passports if you're a
Suspicious-Acting Person like Dave del Torto.
If you want to damage the RFID of a passport you're playing with,
microwave ovens should do just fine.
I don't know if Rivest's RFID-blocker chips use the same
frequency or codespace as the passport RFIDs,
but you could also leave one of them in the back of your passport.
I'd be surprised if you could put out enough energy to cook
the passport RFIDs of people walking by at normal speed
without also causing lots of other electrical problems.

This'll probably apply to the UK's new National ID cards if they ever approve them.
'Don't smile for passport photos'
Tuesday, September 06, 2005
LONDON, England (AFP) - Britons are being told not to smile for photographs when applying for new passports to avoid confusing new security scanners introduced at airports worldwide, officials said yesterday.
Passport applicants from next week must keep their mouths closed and retain a neutral expression to meet new facial recognition technology being used in airport scanners, they said.
The new international requirements were announced in August 2003 as part of a process to enable production of new, more secure biometric "ePassports" with facial recognition technology, the United Kingdom Passport Service said on its website.
By 2008 it is hoped that fingerprint identification will also be used in Britain is among the first countries to implement the new requirements, a spokesman at the Home Office (interior ministry) said.
There were concerns that Britain would not meet the United States deadline for passport changes, which was brought forward in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks in the United States, the spokesman said.
Without the new ePassports, visitors would have to apply for visas, the spokesman said.
However, the United States has not been able to keep up with its own deadline, delaying it twice, leaving Britain enough time to implement the new requirements, he added.
The security scanners are reported to work by matching key points on the holder's face, such as the mouth and eyes, with the photograph.
The new rules, according to one report, say "photographs must show no shadows: your face looking straight at the camera, a neutral expression, with your mouth closed".
Eyes must be open and clearly visible, and there must be no sunglasses, tinted glasses or hair across the eyes, it added.

TITLE:   Special-Purpose Hardware for Integer Factoring
SPEAKER: Eran Tromer, Weizmann Institute
Factoring of large integers is of considerable interest in
cryptography and algorithmic number theory. In the quest for
factorization of larger integers, the present bottleneck lies in the
sieving and matrix steps of the Number Field Sieve algorithm. In a
series of works, several special-purpose hardware architectures for
these steps were proposed and evaluated.
The use of custom hardware, as opposed to the traditional RAM model,
offers major benefits (beyond plain reduction of overheads): the
possibility of vast fine-grained parallelism, and the chance to
identify and exploit technological tradeoffs at the algorithmic level.
Taken together, these works have reduced the cost of factoring by many
orders of magnitude, making it feasible, for example, to factor
1024-bit integers within one year at the cost of about US$1M (as
opposed to the trillions of US$ forecasted previously). This talk will
survey these results, emphasizing the underlying general ideas.

@_subject: [arma@mit.edu: Re: Wikipedia & Tor] 
One way to build a psuedo-pseudonymous mechanism to hang off of Tor
that would be easy for the Wikipedians to deal with
would be to have a server that lets you connect to it using Tor,
log in using some authentication protocol or other,
then have it generate different outgoing addresses based on your ID.
So user  gets to initiate connections from 10.0.0.37,
   user  gets to initiate connections from 10.0.1.2, etc.
The reason to use Tor mechanisms is to make connection
potentially easier by reducing the number of mechanisms a client needs;
the reason to use different IP addresses is for Wikipedia's convenience.
It's mainly useful in environments where you can use private address space,
so if you're running it on a Tor-friendly location as opposed to
Wikipedia's rack space, you might want to tunnel it across the Internet
through something other mechanism such as GRE/L2TP/IPSEC/etc.

PGP might still be "crypto where it doesn't belong", but VPNs aren't -
not only do big companies use them extensively for home workers,
but small companies are much more likely to use VPNs than
to set up frame relay networks these days.
It's amazing how something that used to be a cutting-edge

standard tool for daily commuting for much of the workforce.
VPNs are also used for connections between companies,
but for most of my (big-company) customers,
they're primarily used for workers at home or on the road,
especially since most of the country has broadband.
Meanwhile, the _really_ popular encrypted P2P is Skype.
It's not the world's best crypto (mainly due to
poor choices of strong algorithms, e.g. RSA instead of DH),
and being closed-source you can never be too sure what's happening,
but it's Pretty Good, and extremely widespread for home users.

@_subject: "A million bucks in stolen calls"...Details 
Go check out AT&T Internet Protect.
AT&T started it as a research project a few years ago,
logging traffic at AT&T peering points, and it's grown to cover
more of the network, and customers can subscribe to
summaries and analysis of the traffic data.
It logs to&from IP addresses, protocol, to&from ports,
timestamp, and maybe another field or two like DSCP/ToS
or TCP syn/ack bits or whatever.
and yes, there's a big honkin' custom database backend.
I don't know which data they keep for how long,
though it's at least a month for some of the data.
If you remember the EFF suit about AT&T helping NSA eavesdroppers,
the descriptions of the "secret" equipment all sound pretty
much like the stuff AT&T's had in public sales brochures for
a few years, except for the issue of how much access
NSA gets to the database.
 From a research perspective, one of the biggest problems is
how to make any sense of that much data and present it in
some sort of useful format.  One of the measurements that
seems to be really valuable is looking at what percentage
of traffic is a given protocol, either by bytes/packets/flows,
and how much that's changed in the last day/week/month.
For instance, back when the Slammer worm came out,
there were half a dozen events over the preceding week
that were big spikes in UDP 1434, so we knew to build blocking filters.
So there'll be a lot of reports like "there's been a big increase
in traffic on TCP Port 139", with analysis like
"it's related to this week's latest Microsoft vulnerability,
and it seems to be a widely distributed search for targets", or
"most of it's from the X virus, with a bit left over from the Y virus", or
"it's a very focused 10 Gbps attack on a gamer's DSL line
coming from the dorms at X university,
with a bit of collateral damage if you're nearby."
Some of the information is similar to what you'd get from
McAfee or SANS, but it's got a different perspective because
of the scale of traffic measurement.

@_subject: more on Search queries *can* contain personal information 
Lauren commented on the wide range of things that people search for,
and it keeps getting wider as Google and other search engines
add features.  I regularly type in names, phone numbers, addresses,
and lat/longs, IP addresses, AS numbers, patent numbers, Cisco part
numbers, etc., sometimes to find maps, or businesses, or phone book
information, and there are a number of websites I use for business
for which Google is a much more effective search tool than the site's
own indexes.  Sometimes I've even typed in my own name when looking
for cached versions of mailing list articles in the distant past
(non-specific ego-surfing isn't very useful if your name's not
sufficiently unique - AltaVista had over 50,000 hits for people
with similar names when it first came out - but there are times that
specific searches are useful.)
As somebody who regularly used Google during the specified period,
do I have a right to object to the court if Gonzales wants my data?
I hereby declare any phone numbers, addresses, and medical information
in my searches to be Confidential, though the subpoena doesn't allow
the recipients to declare their entire document as Confidential.
Furthermore, the subpoena indicates that for every document not
produced by Google due to confidentiality or trade secrecy, the
respondents want the authors' and recipients' names, addresses, dates,
etc. - but for this type of information, that disclosure includes
the confidential portion and more, not less.
Gonzales et al. allege that they're looking for information about the
effectiveness of web filters as a tool for protecting children, so they
want to look at popular search terms to see what people are looking at.
But if I search for a term like "Scooter Libby", am I looking for
information about him as an friend, or a Republican Henchperson,
or a well-known pornographer?  His original request wanted _all_ the
search terms, including my attempts to find relatives' current mailing
addresses, and makes it available to all attorneys and employees of the
Department of Justice who are involved in the case - but that's all of
them, given Gonzales's War on Obscenity, and nothing in the subpoena
forbids them from making other uses of the information, such as using
my searches for medical marijuana information for Drug War purposes.
Brad Templeton talks about issues of identifying IP addresses, and the
Tor project certainly helps - but there are other web surfing privacy
tools, like The Anonymizer and other proxies, which are generally
faster, more scalable, and effective at protecting content, though
they're still susceptible to subpoenas for any information that
they may have retained.

At 03:13 PM 7/28/2006, Steve Schear wrote to Cypherpunks:
It's an article about a kid in Philly who used his cell phone
to photograph a bunch of police, and was hauled off to jail
and threatened with being charged with
obstruction of justice and a number of other things,
including breaking "a new law that prohibits people
from taking pictures of police with cell phones."
After about an hour, his parents got him out,
with police saying that he was lucky because there was

No big surprise.  Cops routinely lie,
and they often beat up photographers and smash cameras.
The time I was arrested for photographing police,
who were harassing a friend of mine and stealing his car radio,
it was before the Rodney King case,
and I was using a camera with real chemical film in it.
Somehow the film got exposed to light and the camera got
broken a bit before they gave it back.
Unfortunately, there was a supervisor on duty
(he'd been at the scene of the alleged crime),
so I did get charged with something,
which got dropped after I paid for a lawyer and
the case came up for trial.
Supervisors lie just as much as regular police -
don't believe anything they tell you about court procedures :-)
My friend's case did get to trial - the police did lots of lying
on the witness stand, but unfortunately his car registration
really _had_ expired, and since that charge stuck
they also got to bust him for a burned-out taillight.
And these cops were just local boys and girls -

@_subject: /. [PGP Creator's Zfone Encrypts VoIP] 
SIP is no longer quite "simple", but it's certainly simpler and more powerful than H.323.
It looks a lot like an IM system.
The basic model is client/server, with servers that can proxy requests to other servers,
where the job of a server is to provide presence service so that
clients can find each other, and actual media channels are client-to-client.
(This does mean that you sometimes need to tunnel through NAT and firewalls.)
Because servers can proxy requests to other servers,
it's no longer a simple hierarchy model.
And most SIP clients support direct client-to-client connections -
as long as you figure out the destination user's address yourself if you don't have a server,
and don't mind not having a server to tell you who's calling, reject junk callers, etc.
A popular approach is to have an IP PBX that uses SIP functions to
listen to IP phones or IP video, talk to other IP PBXs,
and talk to telco SIP servers to reach old telco phones,
(alternatively to support traditional telco lines using hardware on the PBX),
and also to talk to other servers like conference bridges,
voicemail, or voicemail-to-email gateways.
The two main pre-SIP standards our there are H.323, which is a simpler
client-server model that reuses large amounts of ugly ISDN protocols,
and Cisco's SCCP (aka "Skinny") which is a simpler pre-H.323 protocol.
There are a number of different SIP server types out there
- Asterisk IP PBX is a free open-source application that runs on Linux.
         Most of the development is funded by Digium,
         a company that sells hardware like telco interface boards for PCs,
         including T1, single-line telco interfaces, and single-line phone interfaces, etc.
- VOIP servers built into routers.  Cisco mostly uses Skinny, but they'll do SIP "real soon".
- Old PBX vendor PBXs with IP boards - mostly H.323, with SIP support emerging.
- Centralized SIP servers that support sites with IP phones and no servers -
         This includes routers from Cisco, etc., as well as
         specialized servers from vendors like Sylantro and Acme Packets.
         In the pre-SIP world, you generally don't mix site-based servers
         like Asterisk and centralized servers, because you don't need both,
         except for things like Cisco SRST failure-mode support in routers,
         but since SIP supports proxies, you may have a local server
         that does your basic presence service and centralized servers for - Some people are playing with Distributed Hash Tables instead of real servers.
As far as encryption goes, SIP does most of its signalling with
an HTTP-like protocol that you can run over TLS,
and does media support with RTP (which can be the secure or non-secure Unfortunately, far too many SIP servers don't handle the crypto negotiations,
not only do they not burn the horsepower to do signalling over TLS,
they also don't help the clients exchange keys.

Your traceroutes went to the east coast because that's the
closest peering point to most of the destination networks you were going to,
and BGP mainly works with hop counts unless you do a lot of tweaking.
AT&T never really ran the cable TV IP networks themselves
when they bought the cable companies - it was still the different
cable company operating folks that did most of it,
and really they knew a lot more about Pay-Per-View than Internet data,
as you might guess from the Don't-Even-Think-About-Running-Servers rules.
The level of lack of integration was such that even though
most of the cable companies had huge infrastructures of dark fiber
along their cable rights-of-way, we weren't able to use that
to sell access services to customers until the last few months
before Wall Street made us sell the cablecos and give the money back.
AT&T did provide them a bunch of wholesale backbone service -
I don't know most of the details, and probably couldn't tell you if I did
because of the usual customer-confidentiality rules.
But you've got to remember that 2002 is a long time ago compared to the
current Internet peering relationships.
Public Peering back then still mostly happened at the MAEs and NAPs,
and still mattered back then, though most of the bigger ISPs
did private peering for the bulk of their traffic..
I don't remember if everything had moved to Equinix yet.
I don't know who  peered with other than AT&T -
we peered with them in 9 or 10 cities, and typically peered
with the really big ISPs in half a dozen cities each and
the other big ISPs in 3-4 cities each,
but I don't know how many of them  peered with.
(AT&T peered with  in Chicago, but that doesn't mean that
 peered with, say, UUnet there even if they could have.)
AT&T had some OC192 backbone trunks in 2002,
but mostly OC48 on big routes and there was still a fair amount of OC12,
and most of the peering was at OC12 or OC3,
which was still big back then.
(We were the first carrier to run OC192 trunks, having scooped Sprint
by a day or two, but for the first few months it was really
a demo link from NYC-Boston that they only ran in the daytime for PR
because the Cisco cards didn't really work yet...)
Bouncing around Chicago 3-4 times was entirely no surprise -
until carriers got really big hub switches in,
you'd typically see at least three hops at any POP,
one to an inbound router, one to a hub, and one to an outbound router,
and the reason you don't see that today is that
a lot of it's happening as Layer 2 Ethernet switching
or Layer 2.5 MPLS switching depending on the carrier,
so Traceroute doesn't know about it.
And if you're going from carrier to carrier, you'll see more.
And then there's annoying weirdness like
connections from Carrier A in Denver going to Carrier B in Denver
via Seattle and San Francisco because they don't peer directly there,
but carrier B peers with Carrier C who's got an OC48 to Carrier A
in Seattle and only an OC12 in SF so they hand it off there,
and Carrier A connects Denver to SF and CHicago but not Seattle :-)

For stored material, that may be useful,
but for communications, it's the wrong model.
Too many online applications currently use
RSA encryption to transfer an encrypted key,
which is vulnerable to later disclosure,
instead of using Diffie-Hellman key exchange
and some signature algorithm (RSA, EG, whatever),
for which compromising the key doesn't expose previous communications,
only exposes the user to MITM attacks,
is much easier to argue against disclosure of,
and of course is much easier to replace (blocking MITM with the compromised Email messages are an appropriate use of RSA-encrypted keys,
but any online two-way communications,
including VOIP, IPSEC, web forms, and transmission of email,
really ought to be using Diffie-Hellman instead.

In most cases, it's probably not hard - you mainly need to choose the
right options from standard packages, and make the DH versions the
preferred method instead of a fallback.

V Meets The Secret Service
Accepted As The Vox Populi
On Monday, November 6, 2006, V visited security check points at the White House, the main Treasury, IRS and Justice Department Buildings and the Capitol. Vs purpose was to deliver the Peoples Petitions for Redress of Grievances relating to the Governments violations of the war powers, tax, privacy and money clauses of the Constitution, and to inform key Government officials that at least 100 more Vs would be at their doorstep on November 14th expecting a response to the Petitions.
At the White House about a dozen Secret Service agents appeared on foot, bicycles and car to meet V. While virtuously assuring the security of the state, they were curious about the image of V and asked many questions. Most, when asked if they had seen the movie V for Vendetta, smiled their When an agent asked if V would remove his mask for identification purposes, V explained that would defeat the very purpose of the mask, which was to give expression to the fact that the nation was becoming a police state, that too many people were becoming afraid to be identified as dissenters or protestors, and that this was not in the long term interest of a free people.  The agents accepted the veracity of Vs message and refrained from veering V from his vanguard visit as the vox populi.
Many law enforcement agents dutifully responded to the first impression security concerns caused by Vs dramatic and startling presence at the seat of governmental power. All but one who confronted V were generally pleasant, professional and ultimately respectful of the voraciously valued Rights of peaceful protest, dissent and Petition that V was claiming and Unfortunately, there was one agent who, either out of vanity, vice, or emotional instability, believed his vows of service and badge would vindicate his use of violence where clearly none was justified.
One Secret Service agent near the White House, even after he and all the other agents had recognized that the toy daggers in Vs belt were plastic and part of the costume, and despite the clearly peaceful and non-threatening behavior of V, the officer forcefully seized the plastic daggers from Vs belt.
After a bit of mental gymnastics between the agent and V, amid the growing public spectacle and peer pressure from his fellow officers (who voiced their agreement with Vs logic and assertion of his Rights), V eventually prevailed over the vexed officer and succeeded in securing the return of the toy daggers.
The crowd by the White House gates also included activist Cindy Sheehan and her supporters who were demonstrating nearby and had gathered to observe the incident between V and the Secret Service. They let out a cheer as the SS agent stood down and returned the plastic knives.
At Vs request, a Secret Service agent called up to the White House to ask if someone would come to the gate to accept service of the papers. After 20 minutes or so, word came to the gate house that the papers should be mailed to the President. This was done the next day.

After departing from the White House, V walked around the White House compound to the security checkpoint at the Treasury Department.  Treasury accepted service of the papers from V without incident. Other than the agent at the security check point who instructed V to use his phone to call the mail room, the only other person to speak with V was Mr. Lynch from the mail room.
The IRS building is apparently still closed due to the flooding experienced last summer. The agents at the security check point informed V that the papers would have to be delivered to IRS at 500 North Capitol Street. Rather than do that, the papers were mailed to the IRS Commissioner the next day.
At the Department of Justice several armed agents with Homeland Security patches on their arms, as well as DOJ security personnel met V. They too were very curious. There ensued another prolonged face-to-mask exchange of news, information, affirmations and assurances. Eventually, the officers determined that V and the camera person were not violating the DC code dealing with the wearing of masks on the streets of the city, or their refusal to produce identification, and that they were not a security threat. The protective security forces and agents from the DOJ arranged for a Mr. Burroughs to accept service of the Petitions for Redress for the agency.
Note: The most disturbing part of Vs interaction with the law enforcement authorities at DOJ occurred when the Homeland Security agent in charge asked V what was the purpose behind Vs presence at DOJ. V began to explain the First Amendment freedoms and the Right to Petition. Almost immediately the agent said, in effect, Youre pulling my leg. You are trying to pull a fast one. Im not falling for the garbage. I dont want to hear it. At that point the agent phoned the DC police and learned that V was not violating any municipal laws. After asking V where he was going next, he told V he was free to go.
At the Cannon House Office Building, the agents of the Capitol Police who were manning the security check point told V they were instructed not to let him into the building. They said the papers would have to be delivered to a Pitney Bowes facility at 119 D Street. The papers were mailed the next day.
At the Hart Senate Office Building, the agents of the Capitol Police said someone from Majority Leader Frists office would have to come to the security check point to accept service of the papers. V was given the phone number of Senator Frists office. The young man who answered the phone said he was the only person there and could not possibly leave the office. The papers were mailed the next day.
As V and the videographer walked from one location to the next, he met and conversed with many people. About half of the people smiled; some said they had seen the movie. About half clearly did not know what to make of V and avoided eye contact.
Some people were interested in conversing with V, including a group of 6-10 college age young people who were waiting in a line to tour the Capitol. During the conversation, V said he wanted to quiz them on their knowledge of the Rights covered by the First Amendment. V asked if they could name the five freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment. Two or three immediately said Speech. After a moment or two one said, Worship God. V restated that freedom for the young man. Then another said Guns. V corrected him.
That was as far as the young people could go in answering the question. V then engaged the young people in a discussion of all five of the freedoms and the four outstanding Petitions for Redress. The young people stayed with the conversation, expressing an interest in learning more, until they had to move along in the line.
All in all, Mondays dry run was beneficial. All local and federal law enforcement agencies in DC have now been introduced to V. They now know that on November 14th there will be more than 100 Vs rallying at Lafayette Park and the Reflecting Pool and marching from one rally to the other along the streets of DC, stopping at various federal buildings to await a response to certain Petitions for Redress.
All local and federal law enforcement agencies in DC now know the purpose of these events is to show peaceful support for the First Amendment Right to Petition Government for Redress of Grievances and to give expression to the fact that too many Americans are beginning to fear the Government and that that is unhealthy to the longevity of a free people and our Republic.
All participants are asked to arrive at Lafayette Park between 11 and 11:30 am on the 14th. The event starts at NOON. The group will wait up to 1 hour for a representative of President Bush to appear and to tell the group when they might expect to receive a response to the Petitions for Redress of If no such representative appears, the participants will move to the front entrance of the Treasury Department where they will wait up to = hour for a representative of Secretary Paulson to appear. If no such representative appears, the group will move to the Justice Department where they will wait up to = hour for a representative of Attorney General Gonzales to appear. If no such representative appears, the group will move to the Reflecting Pool by the Capitol where they will wait up to 1 hour for a representative of Speaker Hastert or Majority Leader Frist to appear..

It's easy to attract a lot of spam - luck of the draw,
or having your name widely spread in archives,
or having ever provided free email services.
Also overkill, but highly effective.
Greylisting turns out to be a big big win -
most zombieware doesn't ever retry, so you lose that spam.
Another popular spammer trick lately has been to
hijack unused address space, usually unused small blocks in
larger allocations, spamming madly for a few minutes,
then dropping the BGP advertisement so nobody can traceroute back,
and never reusing addresses so you don't care if it's blacklisted.
Greylisting totally protects you from this technique,
because a typical half-hour delay means that the spammer's gone,
but Alif's techniques are likely to lead to the legitimate space
getting blacklisted, while the spammer is living behind some
entirely different ISP that openly accepts bogus BGP requests.
Another defense against this spammer trick, if you've got a
big enough network connection to accept full BGP routes
(i.e. you're a medium-large service provider, but not a home system)
is to not accept any email from a BGP address block that
has existed for fewer than 24 hours or some similar threshold
that's long enough to make address thieves go away or get traced,
but short enough to not bother legitimate email much
("453 The Wizard Says Go Away and Come Back Tomorrow")
The ISP where I get most of my email lets users pick countries
or regions to reject mail from, using lists that are more precise
than "burn the /8".  I decided a few years ago to reject all mail
from China, Korea, Brazil, and Argentina, and that cut out
more than half my spam load, and I didn't know anybody from those
countries; I'll accept mail from Japan and Israel but it gets extra filtering,
since I do know some people there but it's mostly spam
(unfortunately, they don't have an option to filter by character set;
anything in alphabets I don't read is highly likely to be spam,
though at work I do get email in mixed English and Japanese or Chinese...)
A _real_ nuclear glass approach would be to start advertising
BGP routes for the addresses that spam you, which would drop them
off the net for anybody who's within a few hops of you,
and wouldn't even give you much extra network traffic,
because it would kill the TCP handshake responses from
any new email sessions.  I work at a Tier 1 ISP,
which would mean that it would be blocked from most of the US,
and somebody with a LINX account could do the same for half of Europe,
but fortunately they don't give me the keys on days that
the spammers have been makin' the ganglia twitch...
and you could accomplish the same thing non-destructively
with a block-list if enough people trusted your service.
In reality a legitimate ISP would never do this or permit their
users to do it, because it could not only cause chaos for the
entire Internet, but it would trivially blow through the
route-cached capacity of most of the routers on the Internet.
There was an event a decade or so ago when some small ISP
announced that their T1 line was the best route to reach
everything at Sprint or MAE-West or something,
so about 1/3 of the traffic on the Internet was trying
to get through there before the line smoked,
and most ISPs put in a lot of route protection then.
The address-space hijackers shouldn't be able to do it either,
but there are enough ISPs that are sloppy about managing
route advertisements that they get away with it.

Fire strikes Army counter-espionage building
6-alarm blaze breaks out at Fort Meade, Md.

FORT MEADE, Md. - A fire at the Army base that houses the National Security Agency heavily damaged a building containing sensitive materials Friday afternoon, base officials said.
There were no serious injuries, officials at Fort Meade said.
The six-alarm fire at Fort Meade started shortly before 4 p.m. in a building whose contents are sensitive in nature, said Fort Meade spokeswoman Jennifer Downing.
The building contains the 902nd Military Intelligence Group Command, the Armys largest counter-espionage unit, according to the groups Web site.
Lt. Col. James Peterson, director of emergency services at Fort Meade, would not say what kind of work was going on inside Building 4554.
Strong winds hampered efforts to contain the blaze at the three-story brick building, which was evacuated. Part of the roof collapsed onto a lower floor before the fire was contained.
We dont really know the cause. We just know it started on the roof of the structure, Peterson said.
Minor construction was under way in the area of the roof where the fire started, Peterson said. There was no damage estimate.
The Army base, between Baltimore and Washington, has about 39,000 employees.

When I've looked at OTR, it's basically an instant messaging client;
has anybody adapted it to carry email or other applications?
I'd describe it much more as "the death of PGP support for email".
When my laptop got stolen a couple of years ago,
I did the right thing and genned up new keys,
and installed current versions of PGP (the free-beer version of the commercial product)
(and its Eudora plugin.)  A few months later the PGP expired,
and since I hadn't been sending encrypted email to anybody in a while,
I'd forgotten the new long-enough-for-21st-century passphrase (:-),
so I haven't been able to revoke the keys sitting out on the keyserver.
Periodically Hugh bitches at me about not sending/accepting encrypted email,
and I suppose I should just install GPG, using cut&paste instead of the
friendly email plugin, since not only is PGP no longer supporting
non-corporate users much, but Qualcomm has stopped supporting Eudora.
Meanwhile, at work, MS Outlook has a reasonably friendly interface
for sending encrypted and/or signed email, at least to coworkers,
and I can't use it because our internal certificate authority
can't generate a certificate for "billstewart at att.com",
though it's happy to generate one for "ws5832 at att.com",
an internal address I have no intention of sending to any humans.
On the other hand, the P2P-punks community is burning something like
30-50% of the bandwidth on the internet.

@_subject: Storm, Nugache lead dangerous new botnet barrage 
Encrypting the control channel isn't going to burn a lot of CPU;
hopefully the botnet doesn't need more than a few KB/hour of control,
and almost certainly it wouldn't need more than a few KB/sec of data
(such as spam-target email addresses), so encrypting it's low-horsepower.
The heavy-resource job of a bot is sending out lots of packets to targets,
whether it's spam email sessions or DDOS UDP packets,
and the limiting factor on that is upstream bandwidth, typically 128-768kbps.
On a modern CPU you could even encrypt that traffic if you wanted,
without the CPU breaking a sweat, though the only application I can see for is encrypted SMTP sessions if you're spamming somebody high-tech.
Most computers have enough spare CPU that they can burn it looking for
space aliens or folding proteins at home without noticing a performance hit;
the real trick on keeping resource consumption low enough to not be noticed
is managing upstream bandwidth so that you don't stifle http queries and TCP acks.

microwaves or ultrasonics or whatever off of them

Interesting.  On the other hand, back when I had experience
with TEMPEST rooms in the mid-80s, the leakage difficulties
weren't the main walls, but sealing all the joints;
a surprisingly small gap is enough to let signals out,
and leakage is wavelength-dependent.
Back then our computers were Vaxen running at
tens of MHz (though we usually tested
with higher frequencies) - now the computers are running
at tens of GHz, and I'd guess that shielding is a lot harder.

i.e. the way you'd read most technology articles,

As far as I can tell, they're talking about Intrusion Detection,
trying to look at the traffic pointed to *.gov to find out
if it's safe or hostile traffic - not for political content,
but for viruses and malware and break-in attempts.
Because they're the NSA, they of course think they're the
smartest dudes in the business, and maybe they are or
maybe it's just ego - they at least have lots of practice
being attacked by well-funded attackers as well as random teenagers.
Remember that when they're talking "civilian" here,
they don't mean "citizens' home internet connectivity" -
they mean "Feds who wear suits, not uniforms";
the military has its own sets of network protection.
The real public-network question here is how deeply they're going to look into
the ISPs that are sending traffic to the feds through this system -
are they just checking whois records and block lists,
or are they also doing more intrusive checks on the people
who contact .gov?  If your kid's PC gets infected by a botnet

or will your ISP just get a "please clean up yet another zombie" note?
Also, how deeply are they looking at content?
Are they going to use this to harass Feds doing politically sensitive
work that  doesn't share their political agendas?
Or are they really just looking for viruses and bad Javascript?
My guess is the latter, at least for the initial deployment.
It's just that with the culture of secrecy and abuse,

and it's hard to give any reputation except to individual postings,
though I suppose somebody could assert that he/she is the poster of a previous article.
On the other hand, Pseudonymous contributors can acquire reputation
rather more easily.   Some actually show up in person -
Lucky Green and Black Unicorn are notable,
and "Lawrence from Boulder" once came to a meeting without
anybody commenting out loud about whether he was L.Detweiler
until after he'd left (it was fun watching Eric Hughes do a double-take
when he realized who it had probably been.)
Detweiler was an especially valuable person to have had on the lists -
he raised questions about what identity is really about and how to deal with
rabid trolls several years before the September That Never Ended
and before spam was really widespread, and while I can't say we really
came up with good enough methodology, it was a good warmup.

Heh.  There's so much subversive low-quality crap out there from that Bill Stewart person
that there's no chance of cleaning up my act; better to stay employed at $TPC
so I don't have to explain to a new employer about why my mis-spent middle age
should be viewed as an asset and not a liability :-)
As it is, I've got a couple of sources of privacy
- Googling "Bill Stewart" gets you half a million hits, mostly for a jazz          If you've heard me drumming, you know that's not me :-)
- I've changed ISPs or email addresses every decade or two,
         plus some people decorrelate when some addresses have a . in the name and some don't.
At one point Eric Hughes or Tim May suggested that what you need to do to protect your reputation on line
(whether you're using a pseudonym or Ostensibly True Name)
is to have some kind of service constantly slandering you,
so any real accusations just get lost in the noise.
Of course, all of the Too Many Erics in the Eric Conspiracy
were really just pseudonyms, tentacles of Tim May with actors playing the part
when a physical body was needed, and it's well known that
Tim's father was a hamster and his mother smelled of elderberries.
Other than that, it's hard enough to keep all my Yahoo/Flickr/Google/YouTube accounts decorrelated,
since they keep buying each other and trying to squish your separate identities together.
And occasionally even those efforts run into problems - my zip code is 90210
for almost anybody who doesn't need to know my actual zip code,
and various vendors start telling me about the specials they're running at their store
in Beverly Hills or events in Greater LA.

Yeah.  Al-Qaeda and their ilk were really wimpy terrorists compared to forty years of "we can blow up the world N times over and we've got the crazy generals to do it!" nuclear terrorism.  I was a kid during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and one of my neighbors had dug up their back yard to put in a bomb shelter.
It was really freaky the first time I heard the Emergency Broadcast System come on the radio in the ?early 90s? and say "this is not a test" - they were using it for flood warnings during a storm, which is a sensible thing to do, but before that it had always been "this is a test of the 'let you know that the Russians and Americans are trying to blow up the world' alarm system", whether it was EBS or CONELRAD or whatever, so by the time they got to the "flooding" part, I'd already mentally been through the "WTF? The politicians haven't been saber-rattling at each other, is this some surprise attack?  How fast can I get home to my wife?" panic attack.  They'd probably been using it that way for several years, just not at times I'd been driving with the car radio on.

I'm looking for a free email service that isn't linked to one of the major I'd prefer one that doesn't make me provide my "real" email address to send some kind of confirmation code to (otherwise I need to string a couple of those together to get the amount of privacy I want.)
I don't need NSA-proof or even subpoena-proof, but I do want something that's not linkable to Google/Yahoo/Hotmail/OpenID/Disqus/Facebook/etc. (or fastmail or pobox, who I use for other services.)
I used to be able to use dodgeit.com for receive-only email, but they seem to be dead.
By the way, I've found one semi-convenient way to keep web-id accounts separate - I'm running VMware Player on my laptop, and keep separate virtual machines, so any conversations I have with Facebook are really really separate from anything else.  (I got tired of reading the news online and seeing different newspapers saying "Here are the articles your friends are reading today!".)  Some of this could be done with a chroot jail and/or separate Mozilla profiles, but this way I don't have to worry about Flash cookies or other new creative nonsense leaking around.   And it makes it easy to run Linux on my work Windows machine.)

 Explosives stolen at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport
by Eddi Trevizo - Sept. 4, 2011 09:46 PM
The Arizona Republic
A container with explosive equipment has been stolen from Sky Harbor International Airport during a Phoenix police training exercise.
Police said the explosives were taken from a low-security area before screening checkpoints.
The explosives were stolen Sept. 2 about 2:30 p.m. and though police have combed the airport several times, the equipment has not been recovered.
"It is very stable and cannot be detonated without additional equipment and some degree of expertise," Sgt. Tommy Thompson, a police spokesman, said Sunday night.
Police described the container as a blue, soft-sided Igloo container with two half-pound tubes of Cast Booster explosives, which are commonly used in the mining industry.
The letters C and B are written in white letters on the bottom of the cooler and each explosive tube is about five inches tall and one and a half inches in diameter.
Police were conducting a routine training exercise with canines when the explosives were taken by an unknown person in Terminal 4 of the airport, said Thompson.
Officials said airport operations were not interrupted and that federal investigators have been notified.
"It is believed that these items were removed from the vicinity of the airport," said Thompson.
Anyone with information about the incident, or who knows the location of the explosives, is asked to call 602 262-6151 or Silent Witness at 480-WITNESS or 480-TESTIGO for Spanish.

This isn't entirely surprising.  Aside from the traditional problem
of monopoly telecom companies not liking competition,
Ethiopia's been routinely wiretapping phone calls for years.
Back in the 90s, a Dutch friend of mine was doing development work in
Somaliland and Ethiopia, and the phone operator once interrupted
one of his calls to tell him to stop speaking Dutch,
and use some language the police could understand,
like English, Italian, Amharic, or one of the local languages.
He considered getting PGP for his email, but decided it was
more likely to give the police an excuse to confiscate his computers,
which they'd have done more for general corruption than actual politics.

It's not just traffic analysis, though that's another layer of the problem.
And it's not just the issue of PGP being hard to run on some phones, though that makes it a problem for users of those phones.
Phil's not just a cryptographer; he's primarily a service provider here.
If you assume that the NSA can come to you with a FISA court order overriding ECPA, saying
         "Give us every piece of information that anybody sends you,
         including your subscribers and outsiders who want to send email to them,
         any time any new bit of information arrives, Or Else!"
then you can't run a "secure" email service that accepts unencrypted email,
because what you have isn't secure against that threat model.
If the NSA and their rubber-stamping buddies at FISA aren't stepping way over the bright shiny constitutionality line,
you could run an email service that automatically PGP-encrypts any incoming message to a public key associated with the mailbox, and build a user interface for the mailbox client's device that's not totally annoying.
The fact that Phil and Jon say they can't run a service implies that the threat model includes mail in transit, not just mail delivered to a mailbox.
You might be able to run an email service that scans inbound email for an
         X-PGP-Encrypted: header, and if it sees "From:" or "Subject:" first,
bounces the email with a 503 or 550: "Sorry, Encrypted Email Only, Get PGP at but that's really more annoying than just using Gmail with a user name pgp-only-johndoe43
An alternative threat model is that the NSA declares anybody sending encrypted mail to be a target (s/target/weasel-word-of-the-week/g), so any ISP that sends data to silentcircle.com has to allow the NSA to wiretap their connections, just in case they might be encrypted email.  The effects are similar, though it wouldn't provide access to the contents of encrypted SMTP sessions; Phil and Jon might also be refusing to handle email because of this slightly less aggressive threat model.

is a really really hard problem.  Even doing
"high latency protocols that are resistant to traffic analysis"

sufficiently advanced technology, right?
Datagrams don't give you any useful anonymity,

but they do give you a bit more flexibility about timing,
which is important for defending against traffic analysis.
The standard warning about using them for an application is
that it's extremely tempting to use them to reinvent TCP badly,
because TCP really does a lot of things you want,
and in a security context it's tempting to also reinvent TLS badly.
Some other problems with them are that you need to get firewalls
to allow them through, unless you disguise them as other protocols
like the horribly evil things Dan Kaminsky regularly does to DNS,
and if you don't disguise them then they stick out like a sore thumb
on any IDS or netflow analyser.  And if you're the only person using
that protocol, you're not hiding from traffic analysis.
It's a lot easier to hide if you implement your datagrams as
http/https transactions of some kind, but building a bunch of relay nodes
to pass those transactions along ends up reinventing Tor.
Putting them in user space is just fine and mostly more portable.
It's hard to get millisecond-level latency if you do that,

Back in the 80s I ran a TEMPEST-shielded computer room,
with a VAX 11/780 and later some Sun-2 workstations,
doing studies for the government that they didn't want
Commie Spies listening to.
The shielding was basically plywood with sheet metal on both sides,
with special metal joints in between them and on the corners,
packed with wire mesh in the joints to plug any extra leaks,
making a nice big Faraday cage.  The air vents were metal grates
an inch or two deep with zig-zaggy airflow paths,
and our data connections used fiber optics going through
waveguide holes that were about 3" long and 1/8" diameter.
Power feeds used big inductive low-pass filters.
We measured the RF-tightness using meters that ran at 450 MHz,
trying to keep things 120dB tight.  You had one person carry a
transmitter on one side of the wall, another person a reader on the other side.
One experiment we'd occasionally do was to stick a wire
through the fiber waveguides, and if you got more than halfway through,
that was enough for 450MHz to leak out.  I'm not sure what frequencies we
*really* needed to protect against, but the Vax ran at something like 10 MHz,
so 450MHz was way overkill for any harmonics that might happen.
What occurred to me recently was that 10 MHz computers may have been
state of the art for the mid-80s, but that was a lot of iterations of
Moore's Law ago, and I doubt the technology of the time is much use
for current 2-3 GHz laptops.  The main Faraday cage should be fine,
plus or minus a bit of extra copper tape to plug minor leaks,
but all the air vents are going to be awfully leaky at those frequencies.
Any idea what people use today?

Saw an interesting article from Gmail on their inbound email statistics.
Over 91% is authenticated with either DKIM or SPF.  75% is both, the rest is one or the other.
That doesn't indicate how much is encrypted, but anything that has the framework to do that authentication could fetch a key as well.
(Doesn't stop the feds from collecting the mail after Gmail receives it, of course, but it's an indication of how much email could relatively easily add some encryption to reduce in-transit eavesdropping.)

They didn't say.  (And the threat model for spam protection probably doesn't include spammers cracking RSA keys, so 512-bit would be perfectly adequate, but I'd hope people were using 1024.)

Juan, Al - I recommend you dig through the Cypherpunks archives to read Detweiler's ranting.
He was much more interesting than listening to you to squabble.

Detweiler really was just this guy (though I seem to remember some discussion about him being a twin, which could account for a bit of his obsession with identity.)  We did once have a guy show up at a Bay Area Cypherpunks meeting who introduced himself as "Lawrence from Boulder".  I thought that was amusing but didn't say anything; he left midway through, and after the meeting Eric Hughes suddenly noticed "Hey, wait a minute!  Lawrence from Boulder?!?!?"

If that works for you, you could go see the What the Bleep Do We Know which has a bunch of new-agey people who don't understand consciousness or physics
and a few physicists who do understand physics being taken out of context.
It was in theaters a few years back, and seems to have a direct-to-DVD sequel or director's cut or something.
If you do know physics, I'd recommend getting high before you see it...

Back in the 80s I ran a TEMPEST-shielded computer room,
with a VAX 11/780 and later some Sun-2 workstations,
doing studies for the government that they didn't want
Commie Spies listening to.
The shielding was basically plywood with sheet metal on both sides,
with special metal joints in between them and on the corners,
packed with wire mesh in the joints to plug any extra leaks,
making a nice big Faraday cage.  The air vents were metal grates
an inch or two deep with zig-zaggy airflow paths,
and our data connections used fiber optics going through
waveguide holes that were about 3" long and 1/8" diameter.
Power feeds used big inductive low-pass filters.
We measured the RF-tightness using meters that ran at 450 MHz,
trying to keep things 120dB tight.  You had one person carry a
transmitter on one side of the wall, another person a reader on the other side.
