@_subject: the cost of untracability?Re: the cost of untracability? 
[Please excuse the minor taxpunks diversion; there's a relevant point
here, aside from the fact that we're approaching April 15 and discussing technologies that will let some people not care if they're
approaching April 15 in a few years :-]
What it's worth is fairly minimal, i.e. the IRS doesn't see it that way.
If you did transaction Y and then transaction X and now have $100 more
than you did before you started, they think that's capital gain, whether you were buying and selling Yen, soybeans, or mutual funds.
The only difference if you're buying and selling ecash from Bank Foo
is that it may be easier to not tell them about the transaction if it
were all encrypted and outside your home jurisdiction.  What they don't
know won't hurt them...
On the other hand, depending on what country your bank is in, there may be taxes or fees or bribes charged by the bank's home country, which would get passed along to you either directly or indirectly.
No, it's equivalent to buying private-bank currency, which may be
denominated in dollars or ECUs or gold or yen or pesos or zorkmids,
which may be inflatable by some government, or may be backed only
by the full faith and credit of the anonymous remailer in Panama
that you reach your ostensibly Cayman-Islands e-bank through.
Now for the slight cypherpunks relevance - assuming that you're banking
in some currency other than your home country's government's, whether it's hard currency like Swiss Francs or soft metal like gold
or a mixture like ECUs or shares of Fidelity Mercury Fund,
if you to pay taxes on the net result of transactions, you'll probably want a timestamped log of what you did when,
and ideally a good data set of the highest, lowest, and instantaneous
prices of the backing currency on several markets, so you can
report your profits and losses pessimistically.  (For most kinds
of accounts, you'd want those sources to be totally separate,
but for captive currencies like BankFoo Non-Inflatable Zorkmids,
you might want to get them together, though you might want to have
two accounts, one of which is quiet and subscribes to the price reports
and another where your real transactions happen.)

@_subject: Ian's Linux Filesystem Patches 
I installed Ian's filesystem patches for Linux 2.0.11, and then patched the
kernel up to 2.0.15. Unfortunately I soon realized that the entire system grinds to a halt as the kernel performs cryptographic operations on a block
of data. I lack enough crypto expertise to fix this, but I believe it just needs to
be made preemptable, however that works. The filesystem patch, while a
definite step in the right direction, is all but useless in its present form.
For an idea of what I'm talking about, kill your turbo switch, or install on
a slow machine so that this is a bit more noticable. Users may want to kill
their internal chip cache. Patch the kernel up to 2.0.15, and install the kernel. Setup the loopback device as the README file states. Then make a filesystem on that device. The system will slow to a halt about the time that it actually needs to write some data to the filesystem, probably during the superblock write in mke2fs. Then, mount the filesystem and try to write a large block of data to the device. Again, it dies.
This will need to be fixed if everyone wants to install such a patch into
their kernel to reduce suspicion, or if it is to be included as standard in
the kernel source tree. I would fix this if I knew more about the way the
kernel is set up. I do fear making it preemptable may open a large can of
worms, at which point it may be more useful to implement this in userspace,
maybe by the creation of a seperate entry in the device hierarchy.

@_subject: Mix for PC: Mixmaster Remailer FAQ 
Frequently Asked Questions about Mixmaster Remailers
FAQ Verson 1.8 July 4 1996
by Lance Cottrell
This document is a semi-technical discussion of Mixmaster remailers.
I wrote this to answer questions often asked by new users of Mixmaster,
and to explain why you would want to use Mixmaster remailers.
4 July 1996: Mixmaster for Dos and Windows is now available!
I am pleased to announce the release of Mixmaster 2.0.3
It contains many bug fixes, and a much improved Makefile which
makes compiling a snap!
***What is Mixmaster?***
Mixmaster is a new class of anonymous remailers. Inspired by the existing
"cypherpunk" remailers and discussions on the
Cypherpunk mailing list (cypherpunks at toad.com).
Mixmaster is the next generation in the evolution of remailer technology.
***What is an anonymous remailer?***
Quoting from Andre Bacard's remailer FAQ:
  An anonymous remailer (also called an "anonymous server")
  is a free computer service that privatizes your e-mail.
  A remailer allows you to send electronic mail to a Usenet
  news group or to a person without the recipient knowing
  your name or your e-mail address.
For a non-technical introduction to remailers (not including Mixmaster),
I recommend Andre's FAQ. It is posted regularly to:
  alt.privacy
  alt.privacy.anon-server
  alt.anonymous
or you can get it by sending mail to:
  To: abacard at well.com
  Subject: Help1
  Message: [Ignored]
There is also a version on the World Wide Web at
***What do I need to use Mixmaster remailers?***
Unlike other remailers, you can't just make your own message and send it
to the remailer. Mixmaster's security comes in part from using a special
message format. The disadvantage of this is that you need a special program to make the message for you. Once you have that program (the client) remailing is as easy as running the program, and telling it
which remailers you want to use.
***How do I get the Mixmaster client software?***
There are two sites for distribution. The first is at my site ,
or ftp to ftp.obscura.com and read /pub/remail/README.no-export.
The other is by anonymous ftp to jpunix.com.
You will have to follow the instructions there to get Mixmaster.
Because Mixmaster contains cryptography, it may not be exported from the U.S and Canada. The reason for the circuitous route to download
Mixmaster is to show my good faith efforts to keep Mixmaster from being
exported. I understand that Mixmaster may be available in Europe from
***How do I get the software to run a Mixmaster remailer?***
The remailer software is available from the same sites as the client.
***But I only see one Mixmaster distribution?***
The same program is used for both the client and the remailer. The only
difference is in the installation. For the client you just compile it
and you are ready to go. For the remailer, you need to set up mail
forwarding and cron jobs.
***What kinds of computers does Mixmaster run on?***
Unfortunately, not PCs or Macs. But it is being ported to those right now.
Mixmaster runs under UNIX. The only machine it is known not to work on
is Dec Alpha. It has been tested on Linux, FreeBSD, SunOS 4.1.3,
Solaris, and several others. It has been compiled and tested on Netcom. If you use it on a machine or service not on this list, please let me know so I can add it.
***How does Mixmaster work, and why should I use it?***
You should use Mixmaster if you want the highest level of anonymity
available, or if your are tired of building remailer messages your self.
A discussion of how Mixmaster provides this level of security is beyond
the scope of this FAQ, but I put an essay on the subject on my home page.
***Does Mixmaster use PGP?***
No, Mixmaster uses the rsaref package from RSA. Mixmaster uses its own
keys and key file formats. To add a key to a key ring, simply append the key to your key file using your favorite text editor.
***Can Mixmaster post to News?***
Yes, like older remailers some Mixmaster remailers can post to news.
Also like older remailers, not all Mixmaster remailers can post
to news. Request the remailer's help file to check if it supports
posting. Do this by sending mail to the remailer with the subject line   remailer-help
***When Was Mixmaster Released?***
Mixmaster was originally released on an experimental basis in late
1994. There were only ever two remailers running Mixmaster 1.0.
Mixmaster 2.0 was released on May 3, 1995. There are now 18 publicly
available Mixmaster remailers.
***What is the latest version of Mixmaster?***
Version 2.0.3 for Dos and Windows was released July 4 1996.
Version 2.0.3 was released on Nov 27, 1995. This version uses a new
Makefile, which makes compiling it a snap. Several bugs were also fixed,
and some esoteric functions added.
Version 2.0.2 was released on Sept 22, 1995. Mixmaster remailers can
now accept messages containing multiple Mixmaster packets. Mixmaster
can be told to choose a random set of remailers to chain your message
through. It will now route multiple packet messages over independant
chains. Several minor bugs were fixed.
Version 2.0.1 was released on May 27, 1995. The only changes from 2.0
are some improvements in the documentation, and the inclusion of a more up to date list of remailers.
***What remailers run Mixmaster?***
The most recent list of remailers is available on my homepage,
along with the remailer list and key file for Mixmaster. You can simply
replace your current type2.list and pubring.mix files with these.
They are also available from .
My list is simply a mirror of the one on Jpunix, which is maintained
(through much hard work) by John Perry.

The problem with banking applications is that cracking a real key
causes lots of real damage.  I don't think it is illegal (as long
as you don't withdraw somebody else's money), but publishing e.g.
one of the DES keys used for the "EC Card" PIN verification would
bring the European ATM system close to collapse.  Finding a self-
generated key, on the other hand, is not very impressive.

@_subject: OECD on Crypto 
[haven't seen this on cypherpunks yet]
OECD NEWS RELEASE - Paris, 10 May 1996 OECD EXPERTS BEGIN DRAFTING CRYPTOGRAPHY GUIDELINES Cryptography experts from OECD countries have begun drafting a
proposal for OECD Cryptography Policy Guidelines that governments can
use as a guide to formulate their national policies on encryption. Many governments are under pressure within their own countries to
develop a national position on cryptography, which is used in computer
technology to protect everything from product designs to health and
tax records and global correspondence. But the needs of global
technologies and applications require an international --rather than a
strictly national -- approach to policymaking. The fast-paced
development of the Global Information Infrastructure adds an element
of urgency.
The business community, individuals and national security and law enforcement
agencies are all pressing for encryption guidelines and the OECD will strive to
reflect the legitimate interests of all these groups as it drafts Guidelines. The private sector is closely involved in drafting the Guidelines,
with business representatives from the Business and Industry Advisory
Committee (BIAC) participating at the meeting. The OECD meeting, which took place on 8 May, was hosted by the US
Department of State in Washington DC. It was held immediately after a
Second Business Government Forum on Global Cryptography Policy in
Washington DC on 7 May, which was cosponsored by the OECD, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and the Business and Industry Advisory
Committee (BIAC) to the OECD. Two similar conferences took place in Paris in
December, when OECD countries and business representatives met for the
first time to discuss international cryptography policy. The process of drafting the OECD Cryptography Policy Guidelines will
continue at an experts meeting in June and is due for completion in
early 1997.

Just go to your boss and tell him that you have an offer from a
consulting company. You'd be happy to continue working for him
until he finds a replacement (which could take decades) for 90%
of your old pre-tax salary. You should get a big smile in return.
And I believe that you don't need that. Going to a major offshore
vendor makes you vulnerable to traffic analysis (most of them can't
spell Mixmaster). You can get a better setup for $2999 than you get
if you spend $50k. Or do it yourself for $1k. Start by reading
everything from Scope ( The books you find

between the state and the little guy has changed completely. It's

"Drivers Must Allow Fingerprinting"
By Ralph Ellis   _The Atlanta Constitution_ 9/19/96
"Georgians renewing or getting a new driver's license after Sept. 30 will have to provide the state with two fingerprints.
"The right and left index fingerprints will be taken with an inkless scanning device that is part of a digital imaging system being installed in 82 driver's license examination offices across the state said Gordy Wright, spokesman for the Georgia Department of Public Safety.
"The fingerprints will make it difficult for people to obtain licenses with falsified identification papers, Wright said.
"Teresa Nelson of the Ga. Civil Liberties Union said the fingerprinting invades the privacy of law-abiding citizens.
"'I have grave concerns,' she said. 'When we think of giving a fingerprint, we think of being arrested. We feel like we've done something wrong, not because we are complying with the law and are doing something right.'
"There will be no exceptions to the fingerprint requirement..., Wright said, adding that 'having a driver's license is a privilege,' not a right.
"Wright said...the fingerprints eventually will be available to other law enforcement agencies and courts....
"The new licenses will include an instant photo....A bar code on the back will contain a laser recording of the driver's index fingerprints...."

The trickiest thing about it - by far - is the inscrutable English

OK, it's an improvement, but there's still some obscurity and a couple
of other problems:

 w> to create a nym, and use it.  YMMV.
So far I have had no luck, but this may be due to a mail lag, I dunno...
 w>     * The hexadecimal key-ID forms the Email address.  For example,
        if the nym's key is 0x01020304, the address will be:
        anon-01020304 at as-node.jena.thur.de
Already a confusion:  Is not the address pseudonym at as-node.jena.thur.de?
And, since the key ID is an eight-digit hex number, why the confusing
        "...if the nym's key is 0x01020304, the address will be:"
                                ^^
...or am I missing something already?
 w>     * The user-ID of the key contains the pseudonym, only.  Note:
        This is different from the convention, which is to include the
        Email address in angle brackets.
OK, so if I understand this properly, when prompted for an account name
in PGP one simply enters
        pseudonym
...with no quotes or address ("pseudonym" ).

The header fields in parens are identical in function or not?
 w>  - Run 'pgp -esa -u "pseudonym" anon at as-node anonid.asc' to sign and

These various command lines in the helpfile do not work in the pre-legal
PGP 2.6/uix/ui versions preferred by many, though equivalent command
lines of course exist.
 w>  - Test your nym by posting to a test group (de.test is recommended
       due to the location of the server) and wait several days before
       requesting mail delivery.
Well, the sent message didn't show up in the newsgroup here, but there
are often lengthy delays anyway...
 w>  - If it didn't work, repeat the entire procedure.  It's possible that
       the key-ID already exists in the server's database and belongs to
       another pseudonym.
The procedure didn't produce results for me so far, but before trying
again I wish to get confirmation that I am trying properly:
(Shortform directions)
        1:  Generate key with simple, one-word pseudonym, no quotes, no
            address, no nothing.
        2:  Generate -kxa keyfile, pseudo.asc
        3:  -esa encrypt keyfile with Jenaer Remailer's PGP key and send
            to anon at as-node.jena.thur.de via a remailer.
        4:  Account is automatically established and should work
            immediately.
To test...
        1:  Prepare message textfile according to sample:
                Newsgroups: de.test
                Subject: Test
                This is the test message textbody...
            [or, alternately...]
                To: de.test at news.demon.co.uk
                Subject: Test
                This is the test message textbody...
        2:  PGP encrypt the filebody and two header lines with the Jenaer
            Remailer's key using the -esa command, signing the cyphertext
            with your key previously sent to the remailer.
        3:  Send the resulting cyphertext message to the Jenaer Remailer
            via another remailer, making sure to avoid command words in
            the Subject: field of the outgoing message.
As I say, following these protocols I have not yet seen a resulting
message in the test group I have chosen.  Do you feel this is due to
lag, or am I doing something obviously wrong?
 w> 2E.request Email to be delivered?
 w> - Never request a delivery to your real Email address.
So here's what I really want to know:  When/if the new account is up and
running, how _does_ one discreetly retrieve his mail?  I don't see how,
other than to have it sent to alt.anonymous.messages via a mail2news
netmail address such as alt.anonymous.messages at news.demon.co.uk and then
pick through the mess there until some cyphertext message responds to
his right key.
Either that or else have it sent to yet another pseudonymous account,
with all the uncertainties and delivery vicissitudes that entails.

Noise?  Are you on drugs?  This is one of the relatively few _on-topic_
threads on this damned list these days!
If 1500 other folks can be made to give a try to the Jenaer Remailer
then this thread has served a very useful and salutary purpose.

I believe this was the problem; several of the remailers were choking
right when I was doing this experiment.  Indeed, I had to post my reply

ever showed up.

This is mechanically a sound suggestion, but I believe that it is a
primary security measure to avoid any direct contact with fresh remailer,
even using a waste account.

prefer not to use an e-mail pool, but the daunting load of spam and
clueless messages in a.a.m is a nuisance, and you are surely right about
the vagaries of Usenet connectivity.
My first thought was to have them sent to a non-autopinging *.test ng
via a well-tested parsing mail2news gate, but some autopingers ping ALL
*.test traffic passing through a site.  If these ping messages didn't
get automatically bitbucketed at the remailer site, this could be a
problem for the operator.
Anyway, let's see what happens with today's tests...

I say, Lord help me if they outlaw hash bars. This is odd; I am sure that heavy drug dependents are more likely to
want money from welfare, but I query you: Does that necessarily mean that welfare recipients are more likely to be drug dependent?
That's funny, I don't know who the victim is in this drug case you
fail to describe. I haven't read the decision writings. How should
I know?
I could imagine that a junkie who takes some old lady's purse to buy
heroin is victimizing the old lady, but is a student smoking marijuana
and drinking a beer victimizing anyone? What about a heroin junkie who
is rich, though unpopular, and never committed any other crime? Have
they made themselves a victim of something? Maybe so...the needle,
the darkness, the overwhelming Love Which Cannot Be Real. But the
state shouldn't recognize "mystical entities" like this as perpetrators.
The person in this case is making a choice; they will do no harm but
to themselves. Are they then a victim, or a perpetrator, or both?
Does not theft of belongings in any case deserve punitive and
recompensive financial damages? Like the U.S. Park Service theft
of the ranch on Santa Cruz Island?

@_subject: Pasting in From: 
Hash: SHA1
I think so.  The key here is to have all the nym's mail sent from the same remailer, pasting in a From: [nym] header.  The remailer could verify the message by checking the digital signature on the message before remailing it to it's final recipient/s.  When the recipient sees that the Sender: was the nym's usual remailer, he is fairly certain that the message originated from the nymholder, but not as certain as when he verifies the digital signature Also, it would be nice if the nymholder could set the Reply-To: header,
thus allowing him to change his inbox "on the fly" (hotmail, a nymserver,
alt.anonymous.messages, etcetera).
Since anonymous remailing is now considered a free service in the minds of most of its users, charging for it does not make sense.  I'd be curious to know how much money has been collected by the ecash-accepting remailer that Ian Goldberg set up a couple months back.
[nym] remailer like I mentioned above may become lucrative if it generates enough repeat customers (i.e., persistent nyms).  So could charging a fee for each address put in the Bcc: header.

Hash: SHA1
Might be a bit of a stretch, but I think this is because money today is inherently a liability, that is a debt that someone, somewhere has promised to pay back.  Such is the nature of fractional reserve banking and debt-based currencies under which the international financial system Thus if the origin of the money (the indebted party) is obscured, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage the quality of the world's money supply.  After all, how can the issuer of the money collect on the debt that ultimately backs it when the issuer has no idea who to collect the debt from?  Take away the ability to manage debt effectively and the issuer's money quickly becomes worthless (be it a commercial bank issuing deposit currency as a loan to its customers or a government's central bank issuing cash currency to its citizens based on a debt placed upon future generations of citizens).
A money's value is measured by the quality of debt backing it.  If the debt is defaulted on (whether through obscurity, Chapter 11, etcetera), the money loses value, which in turn can have negative systemic repercussions throughout the world's financial markets.  The recent Asian currency devaluations (South Korea in particular) and the accompanying financial woes are a good example of what happens when the debt quality of money devalues.

"If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of government, let it go, let it go: perchance it will wear smooth, -certainly the machine will wear out.  If the injustice has a spring, or a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself, then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law.

A heartwarming report.
The NSA represents the worst of America: its paranoia, its ruthlessness, its end-justifies-
the-means amorality.  The NSA's personnel policies reveal its attitudes clearly
It is ironic indeed that the NSA is being weakened, not by the foreign enemies it
sees behind every curtain, but by the EEOC, as its immoral and callous mistreatment
of employees, its jealous defense of white male privilege, are all finally revealed to be
utterly inconsistent with modern principles.
There is no place any longer in the world for an agency like the NSA.  It is an enemy to
freedom and an enemy to the free citizenry of its own country.
We need a new agency, one to defend us against infowar, to help industrial competitiveness,
to assist Americans in retaining their freedoms rather than attempting to strip them
away for its own evil purposes.  Let us all hope that the changing of the guard at the NSA
will lead to a rebirth and a renewal as an agency looking forward, rather than one concerned
only with guarding its own rear.

Sunday, May 18, 1997 - 20:46:37 MET
Our form of gov't is based on the Judeo-Christian rooted belief in unalienable rights. (though the concepts has been around long befor judaism) These are rights endowed upon us by the life force, they are inherent in our  creation and are subject only to the laws of the universe not by any king, or human leader, and so they cannot be taken away by or infringed on by any human leader or groups.
The whole of the physical universe is bound by laws we do not make but can only seek to understand. Tuning in and acting in harmony with the laws of the universe furthers us in our development( ie agriculture).  Exploiting the laws greedily leads to our destruction.(ie thoughtless industrialization). Furthering nature/the life force is good, opposing nature, seeking to conquer and exploit it, is  bad from our human perspective.
The constitution and bill of rights was the original AP document with a series of checks and balance designed to keep  ultimate power, the right to speak out, organise, gather together, rise up and bear arms, in the hands of the people so no one group could impose the tyranny of their beliefs and the masses. I believe it is human nature to cast off the bonds of oppression. This is the assertion of the life force that always seeks to sustain and perpetuate itself in the
greatest possible array of diversity.
I believe this was a major quantum leap in the history of  human thought and concioussness. A giant step in the right direction of our true divinity but it was sorely flawed; By the concept of property rights. This is where the founding fathers eogos got in the way. The liberation movements of the last century have been based on the same concept of unalienable rights and have attempted to fine tune the document for  a more equitable distribution of planet power to correct the flaw.
You don't need a weatherman or a clinton to know which way the wind
blows. You don't need to be literate to know who is taking what from
whom. You don't need a judge to tell you right from wrong. you have instincts that can tell you just fine. Religion in the earliest sense was the bringing together of the group in an understanding of their commonanlity and uniqueness in a way that  stirred up ones feelings of awe for the power of the universe in order that we would discover our commonality while at the same time instilling a repect for each of our uniqness. So we could be inspired to submit to our inner and outer natures and act in harmony with it and show benevolence in our relations with each other. This is the ultimate anarchist, a ninja warrior of natures rainbow, who fights to defend the unalienable rights endowed on all by life force.
I believe that most of the folks on this list aspire to a form of self govt. A belief and trust in the anarchy of nature tempered with the benevloence brought about by the recognition of our common humanity. A state of affairs where each is a ninja/captain of their own soul.  Who recognize the inhernet rights of all and act accordingly without coercion or direction from an outside source, for the laws of the universe are within us. Who respect the rights of the individual and can let them that would destroy themselves destroy, themselves and them that would live to live. To live and let live and live and let die.
I believe the network is the link to the next level of evolution of human thought and self gov't. A new religion where we can rediscover our common humanity and regroup as a planet, as the one human tribe.  A way to explore our comon roots and learn and develop appreciation and respect for our differences. Where in spite of all efforts to propagandize and spread hate our commanality will emerge. Where all voices can be heard and equitable solutions worked out. Not by "sheeple" but by people allowing their primal natural instincts to govern their actions to be it to  shun, support or defend or defeat someone or We are retaking repsonsibility for our selves and our fellow humans. Again, you don't need a Weatherman or an FBI man to know which way the wind blows. Look outside your window then look inside your window. Rainbow Warrior

@_subject: The Bell Plan 
After reading this news article and a variety of posts on the cypherpunks
list (especially by Tim May and Paul Bradley), I have decided that I cannot
in good conscious allow Jim Bell's persecution for exercising his basic
human right to free speech to pass by without taking personal action to
support him.
  "Then they came for the CypherPunks, and nobody spoke up..."
                                       - Jonathan
  Accordingly, I am hereby starting a thread on the cypherpunks list
to discuss "the possibility of putting the fibers down the air vents of a federal building" to kill its computers, and the feasability
of using other methods to accomplish the same end.
  If Jim Bell is guilty of the charges against him, then I am already
guilty of the same types of charges, as are many other cypherpunks.
I undoubtedly have some of the same files/posts on my computer as
the ones that the government will use as proof of Jim Bell's guilt.
  My action in this regard is for the purpose of protesting the
governments persecution of its citizens, Jim Bell specifically,
and to act to counter the benefits that they expect to gain by
doing so.
(CypherPunk Translation~~"I'm pissing in the government's face.")
  In keeping with what I see as a cypherpunk frame of mind, I am
posting this via an anonymous remailer, but I am also digitally signing it. I am not hiding my identity, but merely taking action to prevent my public statement from being used to unjustly
persecute me.
  In effect, I am telling the U.S. government that in exercising
one of my basic human rights I feel it is necessary to protect
myself legally from the government persecution of its citizens.
  I am also telling them that I will not "go quietly into the
night" in the face of censorship, loss of privacy, and oppression.
I will "route around" the "damage" that the government's policies
and legislation cause, doing so in a non-violent manner.   (Hopefully, but not realistically, they will recognize that
if they manage to block all means for me to non-violently
route around the abrogation of my rights as a free human being,
that my only alternatives will be conflict or enslavement.)
  Anyway, in thinking about the possibilities surrounding the
introduction of carbon fibers into a federal building, my first
thought was in regard to whether or not carbon fibers are
actually known to cause damage to hard drives.
  Does anyone know where this idea comes from and whether it
has any known basis in fact? If there is some basis for
believing it to be a possibility, then it would not take much
effort to test it out. One could get an old computer for a
petty sum and use it to test the results of introducing the
fibers through the power supply.

cold, dead algorithms."

It has been my experience that it is more fun to operate a persistent
identity than to post unsigned and unverifiable messages.
Providing the key is at least a convenience for people who don't have
it already - it saved me a trip to the key server.
What would be really nice is if the mailing list machines time stamped
There was a discussion a little while ago suggesting that toad.com had
been compromised by people who were sowing dissension by partially
distributing certain messages.  Had toad signed all of its messages,
it would be possible to obtain evidence supporting this hypothesis
without relying entirely on the word of people we may not know.
Had somebody compromised toad, they would still have to correctly sign
messages.  Later it would have been possible to prove this had
occurred by comparing messages and signatures.
This would also prevent an attack where somebody forges mail from a
cypherpunks list machine to flush out identities.  If the attacker
sends a unique message to every person, he or she will be able to
break an identity if the message is replied to on the list.
I'm not sure a timestamp matters that much for "authenticating" your
key.  After all, you don't own "Amad3us", you own key 0x4D162BBE1.
If another "Amad3us" shows up, what matters if their string of posts
are worth reading, not whether they borrowed your handle.
It would cause confusion, but since the cypherpunks are so good at
slinging bits, we should be able to handle this.  It might even have
an advantage: reporters and secret police types will have a harder
time dealing with the cypherpunks without adopting some of our
technology and ideas and sharing them with others.

@_subject: One Time Pads (Real Ones!) 
One time pads are under rated, in my view.  Not only are they secure
forever, but the executive branch of the U.S. government says they are
I've been thinking about how practical they are.
One diskette holds about 150 messages.  The people we trust tend to be
people we communicate with a lot.  An exchange of one box of diskettes
should last a long time in most cases.
The first 128 bits of the pad can be used as a key to identify it.
This the recipient can figure out how to decode it by hunting through
his or her key collection for the one that matches.
When keys are exchanged, additional information can be exchanged and
associated with each key.  Length, for example.  This means no length
fields are needed because it can be recovered from the key itself.
There are probably more examples.
One time pads are self authenticating.
For increased security, the use of a double one time pad is a good
idea.  Both correspondents generate key sets.  The message is
encrypted using one key from each key set.  Again, no identifying
information is needed, because the recipient can look for pairs of
keys that work.
If these key sets are exchanged through separate secure channels, they
will be especially hard to compromise.
Also, each user can be confident that the message is secure with
regard to key material if they have generated the keys themselves.
Keys should be destroyed immediately after use.  This means that the
only time the rubber hose attack is effective is during message
Key destruction is a hard problem, though, because it is difficult to
be confident that the key has been completely erased from a disk.  Use
of diskettes improves the situation.  Other media might be better,
such as static memory.
There is no good reason not to wrap one time pads in other encryption
protocols.  It is hard, maybe impossible for some algorithms, to crack
a message when the contents have the appearance of noise.  This means
that it is hard to tell who is using one time pads and when they are
doing it.  Naturally, the user will send many messages which consist
of noise, indistinguishable from a one time pad.  This gives the user
plausible deniability, especially if the practice is common.
If the wrapper encryption protocol has not been compromised at the
time of use, it has the pleasing result that it buys time.  Should the
message be recorded and filed on tape at Ft. Meade, and the encryption
protocol broken ten years later, the user will have a very difficult
time producing the key material.
Key generation is an inadequately solved problem right now.  There are
chips which generate streams of random bits, but it is impossible to
tell if they have been compromised.  A home brew hardware based random
number generator with a serial interface is probably the best way to
go.  The output of this device could be XORed with other source of
randomness to increase confidence.
One time pads seem practical to me.

@_subject: Privacy Software 
So in other words, even though we have the source code we don't really
have confidence that we can tell what it is doing.
Even though the source code is available, I don't think it has been
studied all that carefully.  For example, hardly anybody knew that the
PGP 5.0 source had CAK features lurking in it.  Or, remember that bug
with the random number generator?  As I recall (i.e., feel free to
correct me), it was in Colin Plumb's code and he found it himself.
This would imply that it got by whoever went over the code when it was
released.  Not reassuring.
C is a big part of the problem.  Also, PGP was originally designed to
operate on some fairly slow machines and they tried very hard to
optimize the hell out of it.  Now, however, cycles are a lot cheaper.
I think we should give up speed for clarity.  Slow code that we can
really trust is better.
And, the PGP code does a bunch of careful things which complicate it
like burning the stack all the time.  In my judgement, this is
misplaced.  If you don't trust the platform you are using you can't
fix it in your encryption code.
It's at least worth talking about.  Hashing out the design is a good
exercise and it can inspire other people when they are designing their
own crypto systems.
What's really bad is that any part of the code can betray the rest.
Let's say you had somebody who was really very good who wanted to
weaken things.  All he or she has to do is have a little obfuscated
code someplace that undermines the majority of nicely designed and
implemented C code.
A truly encapsulated language is a lot easier to verify because if
none of the magic functions exist in the code (easy to check), you can
be confident that when you have verified one piece of code that the
other pieces can't interfere.
Hadn't thought of Modula-3, but that is an excellent idea.  Java would
be a candidate, although performance is an issue.  There's been some
good buzz around about Ada.  It might perform well and it's here to
stay.  Is Modula-3 being used in any serious way by anybody?  If it
is, let's consider it.  (I think there is a Modula-3 -> C compiler out
there someplace, which means it's totally portable.)
A good language choice would probably save a lot of time.
It would be nice to just shed the PGP baggage for the moment and think
about how we would do a system from scratch for our own uses.
Ultimately, this system could reside in an application which also
speaks PGP.  Or, it could just be its own thing.
We should use the acronym CMR.  (Cypherpunk Message Remodel?
Suggestions invited.)
CMR nee HCMS should be an independent system.  The mail system you are
using should decide whether to use it or some other system depending
on the correspondent.
While it may seem crazy to toss compatibility, it has some advantages.
For instance, the only people who will use it are the hardcore types.
I like the idea of an exclusive crypto system that only cool people
who are fairly with it use.
What do you think about mandating a key size?  I like the idea that
use of the protocol communicates "I am very serious about my privacy."
It's also slightly cripple resistant.  (And, were I to consider mass
market concerns which I am not, I would say that it makes it easier
for the user to make the right choice.)
How about finding a way to eliminate indicators?  It's nice not to
leak any information at all.  It also makes super-encryption stronger.
If each encrypted layer looks like noise, the total key size is the
sum of the bits of each layer.
One way to eliminate indicators is through the prior agreement of the
meaning of random bits.  In effect, you can say "when you see
0x234B4D234F, it means, outside layer RSA/IDEA, middle layer
3DES/SHA1, and inner layer the Captain Crunch decoder ring."  This
information can be exchanged at the time of key authentication,
securely, by telling your correspondent how you are encrypting
everything.  Later, you can send more random bits when the tank starts
getting low.
Super-encryption is something we should do more of.  Let's say we
believe, conservatively, that any particular cipher we are using has a
10% chance of falling in a particular year.  In ten years, that's a
35% chance of compromise.  But if three different ciphers are used,
there is only a 4% chance that it will fall in a decade.
Super-encryption has been unpopular because it takes too long.
However, if you are using a modern OS, even if it takes five minutes
running in the background it's just not a big deal.
It doesn't seem unreasonable to me to break out authentication from
the communication protocol.  Strictly speaking they are not the same
thing.  Both programs can be called by the same message composition
program.  This naturally leads to using separate communications and
authentication keys.
I am not fond of PGP's signature design.  The "BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE"
stuff clutters things up.  How about a one line signature with a
previous character count?  Note that this wraps beautifully without
modifying the message itself.  It's unobtrusive.
ASCII armor also sets off alarms with me, but I'm not sure exactly how
to solve this problem.  It seems right to define protocols in terms of
full 8 bit bytes.  Perhaps just uuencoding encrypted messages is the
way to go?
For authentication, it would probably be okay to define an ASCII mode.
I think key management is good to think of as a separate application.
The right way to do this isn't clear, yet.  The Web of Trust is a neat
idea, but I think the concept is flawed because you are unlikely to
tell something sensitive to somebody you wouldn't (or couldn't)
authenticate yourself.  Ultimately it relies on things like driver's
licenses issued by Big Brother, which is terrible.
But this is just bad design if you care about security in a serious
way.  Even assuming you have to reveal who you are sending the message
to, why reveal that three messages are related to each other?
This is yet another mass market issue.  If we were to do it the right
way, all the mail header fields would be contained inside the
encryption envelope.
I'll buy that.
If the protocol doesn't accept multiple keys for a message it is
slightly CAK/GAK resistent.  And, it's a nice statement of intent.
It's also nice to have tools which help you to behave securely without
carefully thinking about it when you are using them.
Let's say it is known with high probability that I am forwarding a
particular message with some unknown prefacing comments.  It seems to
me that (possibly) some information is be revealed by the size of
the compressed encrypted text.
That is, the known message will compress to a different size depending
on your prefacing comments.
For example, if I use lots of words that are in the known message, it
will compress very well.  The result will be significantly smaller
than if I use words that never appear in the known message.  This
might not be a problem, but I don't like "mights".
Also, I like things which are really orthogonal.  There's no
particular reason for the compression to be part of an encryption
program, if you use it at all.
The randseed.bin file has always bothered me.  What we really want is
some good sources of entropy in which we have tremendous confidence.
Also, if you signed the message the Date: field won't be needed.  This
is bad design, in my opinion.  A signature and a time stamp are two
different things.  For instance, I would prefer not to time stamp my
messages as it reveals the state of my clock and the transit time of
the messages I send.
Yes, this would be good.  Although, I would think of this as being on
a higher level than the encryption program itself.  Probably we want
an entire communications management program which tracks everything
you've sent and analyzes your activity for weaknesses.
You only need to generate keys once in awhile.  This means that you
can go to some trouble when doing it.  For instance, you might have
some hardware which is not routinely connected to your machine.
Well, neither of these would be good for a one time pad, of course.
It would be neat to have, say, three sources of hardware randomness
and then XOR the result with the above pseudo random output.
It's hard to recognize non-randomness, so some overkill is good
BTW, it would be nice if PGP or CMR/HCMS would let you supply bits of
entropy by hand.  It takes awhile to generate 128 bits by hand, but
for some things it would be worth it.
The hype article was what I had in mind.  I doubt very much that
Borenstein would ever have been involved with such a thing outside a
corporation.  It seems to have a bad effect on some people.
The problem is, you don't always know where that bad effect stops once
you've noticed it.
Comme ci, comme ca.  The libel suit business was uncool.  Also, there
was a press release relating to one of the cracks which was somewhat
misleading, I thought.  C2 has shown some symptoms of institutional
paranoia, which is bad.  Sameer's comments along the lines of "this
isn't some cypherpunk hobby" are also not reassuring.  All of these
things arise from being in a corporation.
The problem is that I'm not tapping their phones.  I don't really know
what they are thinking or doing.  When something happens that is
troubling, it's hard to restore trust.  I don't give C2 five stars.
That said, C2 has done some very good things.  People seem to like
Stronghold a lot.  It really is a secure product.  They publish their
source code.  I do like what they have to say in many of their press
releases and they are getting certain ideas into the mainstream.  (The
Forbes article, for instance.)
Sameer's one line comment "sell code" had a lot of influence on me,
No kidding.  Yes, C2 is miles above PGP, Inc. in my book.
But, Comsec gets the five stars.  They have never done anything or
said anything that gave me less than complete confidence.
The important thing is establishment of the custom.  Most
cryptoanarchists with class will pay.  The way to do this is to make
it clear from day one that it is not free software.  If you want to
run it, you should buy it.  (The problem with share ware is that people
get used to "borrowing" it.)
This should work well.  Cryptoanarchists, in my experience, have
pretty high integrity.  Some people will pirate, true, but that's
life.  Ironically, people who honestly discuss their skepticism of
intellectual property laws are probably less likely to pirate.
These are good ideas.
You know, it would be cool to define a software architecture for
remailer software.  Different remailers have different properties and
different strategies.  They may continue to differentiate.
When you decided to trust a particular remailer, it could give you a
module of code with a standard external interface which prepares
messages for that particular remailer.
Putting your idea another way, the code is "free" but the remailers
cost money.

Pathetic, isn't it?
The important word in this sentence is "agreement".  If the American taxpayer does not agree with how his tax money is being used, does he not have the right to demand that it be used in an appropriate way?  If his demands go unanswered, does he not have the right to refuse to continue paying?  If the American taxpayer does not like substandard education, abortion, weapons manufacturing, destructive environmental legislation, and so forth, why should she be forced to pay for it?
The simple fact is that taxation in America has ceased to be an agreement, and has devolved into extortion with the threat of jail/forfeiture for If one were to break down the anti-Income Tax argument to its most basic level, it would be that the government does not have the right to extort money from its citizens to promote agendas which are destructive of the citizens' persons and property.

They could charge an addtional $1 premium.
Insurance, if properly administered, is a bad bet for the customer if
we only pay attention to financial considerations.  However, the
customer can lose more than money, he or she can lose her life, which
is worth an up front premium to the insurance company.
The numbers we have been working with here are interesting, though.
Usually, the cost of the tests isn't justified by the information they
give us.  Presumably if the tests were economical, they would be
required.  Insurance companies do require checkups sometimes which is
really just a set of tests.
In practice you might not be so heartless.  Even Monty Cantsin has
been known to help those who have fallen upon hard times.
The real philosophical question is whether other people should be
forced to support our charities.  (The real world question is whether
other people should be forced to support alleged charities.)
Those who advocate forced "charity" are making a curious assertion.
They themselves do not wish to dispense the charity they so highly
value, but they wish others to do so, at gunpoint if necessary.
I do not see any way in which such behavior may be defended as
civilized or decent.
Many decades ago there used to be organizations called "mutual aid
societies".  They were sort of like mutual insurance companies, except
they may have been more flexible in the benefits they guaranteed.
They took care of whole sets of misfortunes for their members.  For
instance, if your house burned down or you were laid off, or whatever,
the other members of the society would help you get on your feet
again.  Note: the other members had a strong incentive to get you on
your feet.  (This cannot be said of welfare bureaucrats whose market
share dwindles the more they succeed.)
They were typically organized into local chapters which would then
belong to larger organizations which would, to some extent, insure
that the local chapter remained financially solvent.
The societies were more than insurance companies - they were also
social clubs.  This aspect was used to manage the moral hazard
These societies were tremendously successful.  A conservative estimate
of membership in the United States showed ten times as many people
belonged to these societies as belong to labor unions at the peak of
the labor movement.  Yet, they have been almost entirely ignored by
academia, probably because they do not fit nicely in a patronizing
ideological framework.

The following is from Note that I've only quoted the parts I think are relevent
to a security discussion...
---begin quote---
How does Mobil Speedpass work?
Speedpass uses an electronic system located in the pump to "talk" with a miniature radio-like device (a transponder). Together, these electronic devices provide "instant" access to gasoline by automatically charging fuel purchases to the credit card you've selected. The technology is similar to the state-of-the-art technology successfully used by many tollways.
What happens if my Speedpass is lost, stolen or damaged?
Treat it just like a credit card. Immediately notify our Service Center at 1-800-459-2266. Tell us your name or Speedpass number. And we'll cancel your old Speedpass and send you a new one right away. You should write down your Speedpass number (8 digits on tag) and keep it in a safe place.
Is there a pin code with my Mobil Speedpass?
Can other people intercept the transmission of my credit card number?
No. The Speedpass system operates on a dedicated transponder identification code. Your credit card code remains outside the Speedpass signal system, maintaining the confidentiality of that information and protecting your account from unauthorized use.
---end quote---
I see several options, none seem too secure:
1) "dedicated transponder identification code" (dtic from now on) is
    sent in the clear. Anyone who can listen and re-transmit
    can get free gas.
2) Speedpass and the gas pump negotiate DH key exchange
    and use DES/RC5/IDEA/Whatever. Anyone who can
    impersonate a gas pump can gain access to dtics and
    get free gas.
2) Gas pumps have an RSA keypair, and all of the speedpasses
    know the public key. The dtic is encrypted to the     gas pump's key along with some random data. Anyone
    who can compromise the gas pump's private key
    (including service station operators/employees?)
    can imitate a gas pump and get dtics, with which to
    get free gas.
The third option seems pretty secure at first, until you
realize that it's like putting all of your eggs in one basket
and giving thousands of people physical access to the basket.
Anybody know how they are actualy doing it? Is there
some more secure way I haven't thought of?

While reading the report of the Presidential on Commission Critical Infrastructure Protection,
the Public Key Infrastructure Study and the draft plans for Internet-2, it is becoming
even more aparent what government schemers plan to do with encryption technology.
Some of the statements literaly call for key escrow/recovery systems and others
imply it extensively when one reads between the lines. They want security on the Internet-2 to be like the Berlin Wall.
What amazes me (I guess not, really) is all of the so-called free market corporations
that are in collusion with governent to enable this new Internet Security State. I have
long thought that if government is going to be successful at forcing key recovery onto
the nation in law that it was going to have to have the help of the major corporations
who are looking for the money. It was only one year ago that IBM was lobbying congress
for the contract on the new key escrow system congress was considering and the FBI, et al
were demanding. Never turn your back on the merchantilists.
The IRS, right now, is calling for assistance with their _second_ attempt at revitalising
their archaic networks, mainframes and software. Again, it's the major corporations
rushing in to their aid while looking for those "big dollars". [IRS just spent 4 Billion
a few years back on the very same effort and have virtually nothing to show for it]
Corporate America Saves the IRS. What a headline. Corporate America wants the IRS to be
able to survive to tax us all into oblivion, when what they ought to do is turn their
backs on the IRS, walk away and let them fall in on themselves just like the Soviet Union did.
If we're lucky, around December 31, 1999, the IRS will crash along with their computer systems.

WSJ reports today on the increasing conservatism of the military and

It cites several examples of military members preparing for war at home, as mentioned here earlier by Attila and others, with two Marine writers
claiming that the next Somolia will be here.
This, coupled with reports on LEA inheritance of military equipment and
lavish civilian funding to fight terrorism, portends more than Jim Bell (Tim May?) -type sniper takeouts.
Free fire zones may be in the offing, or surgical wasting of underground

Since Gary Burnore has been making posts in the alt.privacy.anon-server NG
about how remailers are supposedly being "abused" in order to "forge"
articles in his name, I figure it's time to repost a Usenet article from
Jeff Burchell, operator of the Huge Cajones Remailer, about Gary Burnore's
harassment which ultimately convinced him to shut down the remailer, in
order to document Mr. Burnore's modus operandi, in case he attempts a
similar attack against another remailer:

Actually, not even I know the whole story.  If I truely knew who it was
that was orchestrating this attack, it would have stopped, one way or
another.  The problem is, I don't know all the players (I have some
suspicions, which I'll elaborate on further in a little bit) but I don't
_really_ know who did it, and I really don't know why (other than a "I
don't like remailers, I think I'll shut one down").  And I really don't
know the background or what precipitated this.

It is not a small problem anymore when you're getting >200 complaint
messages a day, plus 5-10 phone calls to your employer (and your
employer's legal department).  Fortunately, Wired is a very progressive
company, and supported my efforts to provide anonymity, but our lawyers
aren't paid to answer phone calls on my behalf.  Running a remailer is
one thing... getting harassed at work is an entirely different matter, and
getting a THIRD PARTY harassed at work is yet another one.
But yes, The ultimate "take this thing down" decision was one made
because I was sick of this bullshit.  But you know what?  I volunteer
my time, my computer equipment, and bandwidth that is given to me
as part of my salary.  I do (well did) all of this because I believe
that anonymity is a right, and because I have the capabilities of
helping to provide anonymity to the masses.  When the remailer was
self-sufficient (before the attacks started), it took maybe 10 minutes
of my time a day, and minimal resources on my machine.  Afterwards,
even after I put in the auto-blocking feature (send a blank message
to a particular address and get your address blocked) and the
autoresponder on the remailer-admin account, I was still getting >100
messages a day reporting abuse... almost all of it spam-bait related.
I receive no benefit from running the remailer (I don't even use it
myself), and when it becomes a fairly major hassle without any
rewards, the decision is not a hard one to make.
And frankly, I already have enough to do, and get enough mail on a
daily basis (at last check it was hovering around 600 messages/day).
As soon as the remailer started taking up a lot of my time, it became
time to rethink why I was running it.  The moment that the spam-baiter
started alerting people who had been baited, and telling them to
contact me, it became personal.  And I don't have time to get into
personal pissing-contests.  Yes, I took the easy way out, but that
was my choice to make.
Anyone who doesn't run a remailer has very little right questioning my
 choice, because you have no idea what precipitated it.  Most people
reading this group have the capabilities of running a remailer (it only
takes a POP account and a Windows machine to run the Winsock remailer),
but very few of us actually do.  Why is that?  I've been running huge.
cajones for just under 2 years, and it averaged just over 3000 messages
a day, so my remailer was responsible for about 2 million anonymous
messages in its lifetime.  I think I've done my part (at least for now),
it's time for someone else to do theirs.  If we had 15 disposable remailers
that operated for 2-3 months each before moving/going away, we'd have
paths for millions more anonymous messages.  And isn't that what we're
really trying to provide?
: The first was doing questionable things, like installing content-based
: filtering in an attempt to placate the attacker.  Giving in to the demands
When I first put the filters in, I was entirely unaware of exactly what
the hell was going on.  It seemed that someone had a bone to pick with
databasix, and was using the remailer to get databasix harassed by
third parties.  So, Burnore's complaint seemed reasonable at the time, and
I tried to come up with a way to block spam-bait abuse, without blocking
anything else (like a reply to burnore in Usenet).
See, if someone was doing to me what they appeared to be doing to Burnore,
I would be pissed.  I figured placating him would be the best thing to
do.  In hindsight, I was wrong, but at the time, it seemed like the correct
decision.  (Also at the same time, the SPA threatened Wired with a
lawsuit because of The MailMasher, so things were a little tense between
me and the legal department already, I didn't need to make them any worse.)
The final content-based-filter (there was an interim one) looked for the
 following things:
1. Any address at databasix (Yes, at the request of Burnore)
2. Any address from my destination block list
3. More than 5 addresses in a row, one line each, without other content
   in-between.
4. Patterns of particular Usenet groups.
5. Particular subject lines.
If any THREE of these items were spotted, the message got thrown into a
reject bin.  I periodically examined the reject bin, and can personally
attest that it didn't block ANYTHING that it wasn't intended to.  (The
test posts reeked of spam-bait to me, and I believe were correctly
FWIW, the filters were removed about a week ago.
Because the filters were looking for a specific form of ABUSE, and not
just doing basic pattern matches, I don't consider them to be "content
filters".  I would think that just about anyone would agree that
posting lists of email addresses to mlm newsgroups would qualify
as abuse, and _should_ be blocked.   Blocking of this nature does NOT
restrict free speech (or at least that is not the intentions of it), and
it would keep the remailer out of lawsuit territory.
See, the big problem with lawsuits is not the fact that _I_ don't want
to be sued.  The problem is that anyone with half a brain can determine
that Wired is somehow related to any remailer that I am running on their
bandwidth.  Wired has deeper pockets than Mr. Burchell, so they are a
much better group to sue... and they are a lot more willing to give
in to a threat than I am.
: What I *MIGHT* have done was to respond as follows:
:    Your legal demands are unacceptable.  I'd rather close the remailer than
:    compromise its integrity to suit your whims.  But understand this -- unless
:    you withdraw your demands, I will not only close the remailer but also make
:    damn sure all of its users know exactly who forced me to take this action!
I did respond in a fashion much like this, about a week before the attacks
started coming.  Mr. Burnore requested a copy of my (non-existant) logs.
I told him to get me something in writing, signed by his lawyer that
stipulated that the logs were confidential, and not to be revealed to
anyone outside of the lawyer's office.
I received a letter from Belinda Bryan.  She is not registered with the
State Bar of California, and is thus, not a California lawyer.  I then
ignored the request, and forwarded the correspondence to the State
Attorney General's office (as impersonating a lawyer in CA is defined
as fraud with extenuating circumstances).  They have been working with
me and the San Francisco DA's office.  Look out DataBasix... I'm not done
with you yet.

In fact, now is the time to.  Making a disclosure like this while I
was still running the remailer would have probably been a bad move.
Now that the remailer is closed, I'll name the names that I've got.
Beware... all of this is speculation, because huge.cajones was an
anonymous service, not even I can say with any authority that any
of the people named below had anything to do with the shutdown of
huge.cajones (or The MailMasher).  However, there are a number of
coincidences of timing.
I still don't know what the hell is going on with DataBasix, Wells Fargo
and Gary Burnore, but I suspect that someone used huge.cajones to say
something extremely unflattering about Burnore (from what I can tell,
he had it coming).  Burnore then decided that he would make things
difficult for me.  First, he wanted the user who had posted something
"inflammatory" about him revealed.  When I told him that I couldn't
do that, he carried on about mail logs and identifying the host that
a message came from (the usual).  I didn't explain to him that my
machine keeps logs, but not anything involving a *
address.  He then requested the logs, which I denied (and told him
to get his lawyer to send a request...)
I'll admit, after my second or third contact with Mr. Burnore, I
no longer was particularly civil with the guy.  He's a kook, and
really didn't deserve my courtesy.
Between the time he first contacted me, and the time I received the
letter from Belinda Bryan, is when the baiting of databasix addresses
began (slowly, with just a few posts).  After a while, I received
requests from the other members of DataBasix (including William McLatchie
(sp) (aka wotan) who actually seems to be a remailer supporter (?)).
It was at this point that I realized something was completely amiss.
I asked McLatchie to please tell me the story of DataBasix, and he
said that he was going to, but never did.  Anyone who can tell me
the story is invited to do so.
As a side note (and just because I am naming names).  Peter Hartly
(hartley at hartley.on.ca) yesterday spam-baited me.  Fortunately,
I've got good filters in place.
As another side note, I've seen nothing to make me believe that Belinda
Bryan is even a real person.  Anyone?

I can't claim to have done _everything_ that I could have done, but I
did certainly make an effort.  I'm not willing to go to court to defend
a practice like spam-baiting (and given the current public-opinion situation
and impending anti-UCE legislation, this would be a terrible test-case).
I am not new to threats of lawsuit, even ones that come from legitimate
lawyers.  About 8 months previous, I was threatened repeatedly by the
legal wing of the "Church" of Scientology.  I answered with a letter
from my lawyer that explained the policies of the remailer, and
threatened a harrassment lawsuit if the "Church" contacted me again asking
for information (that they now knew I didn't have) about a remailer user.
They complied, and went away (and haven't been too difficult with
other remailer operators lately).
: Agreed.  Otherwise, these "asshole(s)" are simply going to do it all over
: again against another remailer, eventually taking them all down one at a time.
Except that right now, new remailers are springing up.  If we could get
three more online for every one shut down, it wouldn't much matter, would
it?  I may very well end up running a mailer again in the future, but if
I do, it will probably be either a throwaway exit-man or a truely anonymous
middleman (i.e. nobody will actually know who is running it).  It also
will probably be hosted outside of the United States (Floating in
international waters with a sat feed would be nice).

Aah, you imagine much more solidarity among remailer operators than actually
exists.  It doesn't work that way.  It would be nice if it did, but many of
us are running remailers on borrowed bandwidth (or have other "situations"
to be concerned about).  Being the squeaky wheel is not always a good idea
for many of the operators (most of whom try to keep a low profile).
The reality is, for all the good they do, remailers are tools that can
very easily be abused.  And, as the internet gets more and more commonplace,
the average Joe and Joesphine, who don't have the strict Cyber-Libertarian
viewpoints that are shared by most of us old-timers, will start to wonder
just why anyone would want to run a service that allows anyone to speak their
mind without fear of reprisal.  When you get people with more extreme
viewpoints (the ones who have a really legitimate need for anonymity) posting
all kinds of stuff to all kinds of places, it will get the attention of
Middle-America, which will then bring it to the attention of legislators.
Any time a legislator can say "This is a blow to Child Pornographers and
others who hide behind anonymity to commit crimes without fear of reprisal"
you can guarantee that the bill will pass.
When that happens, we're in trouble.  America is scared of computers, and
remailers are thought to be havens for the big 3 (Terrorists, Organized
Crime and Child Pornographers).  Now that the spammers are involved
(spammers possibly being hated more than the big 3), most users are
exposed to anonymous remailers in negative ways (Imagine what you would
think if the first time you heard about the existance of remailers, it
was because someone had spam-baited you, and then told you about it).
The right to anonymity in the US will be legislated away within 18 months,
partially because of spam.  I do hope there's a _good_ test case waiting,
and someone willing to fight it to the end, but I have my doubts.  Ultimately
the remailer network will be forced to move offshore, the way Crypto
development currently has.

@_subject: Databasix conspiracy theories 
While I have no first-hand information on that, Jeff Burchell, operator of the
Huge Cajones Remailer, reported involvement of three DataBasix staff members:
Gary L. Burnore, Belinda Bryan, and William J. McClatchie (better known by the
pseodonym "Wotan").  McClatchie was also extensively involved in the public
campaign to get Mailmasher shut down.  Jeff's "post mortem" expose' on all
this can be viewed at the following URL:
   at toad.com/HTML-1997-11/msg00536.html
While it's perhaps not the kind of evidence, being circumstancial in nature,
that you'd take to court, it could certainly useful in trying to anticipate
and avoid potential future attacks.  Of the parties involved in the conflict(s) that led up to the remailer attacks, Burnore/DataBasix was the only one who had a motive to attack the remailers.  Gary's alternative theory on who was responsible, Ron Guilmette, is much less plausible.  Gary, for example, has consistently displayed a very bigoted attitude towards those who choose to utilize anonymity to maintain their privacy.  He would often refer to anonymous posters as "anonymous assholes", "cowards", "hiding behind the skirts of a remailer", etc.  Let's take that first phrase -- "anonymous assholes".  If a person were to be arguing with a black man, and called him an "asshole", that would be somewhat acceptable.  But if he called him a "black asshole" or a "ni**er
asshole", he would be revealing his innate bigotry and you'd rightly call him a RACIST, implying that a member of that race had no right to express a
dissenting opinion.  The same applies when an ad hominem attack targets a poster's anonymity.  IMO, that makes him an anti-privacy bigot.  While he's
now tried to clean up his act by claiming that "remailers have their place",
he's on record as saying that they shouldn't be used for "abuse" and he's
defined anonymous criticism as "abuse".  Going back to the racism analogy, that statement is equivalent to the old line "Me?  A racist?  Why some of my best friends are ______".
Also, Gary Burnore expressed the repeated desire that anonymous posts that
were critical of him were designed to "stir up trouble" and represented
"abuse" that the remailers should have blocked.  If the remailer operators
wouldn't censor the criticism in the MESSAGEs, then killing the MESSENGER
(the remailers) would accomplish the same thing.
Belinda Bryan and Billy McClatchie, two other DataBasix staff members, issued even more scathing attacks on the posters' choice of anonymity, and against the remailer.  Upon occasion, they both referred to the remailer as the "No Balls Remailer" and implied that the poster had "tiny testicles".  Although
Belinda and Billy's comments were cloaked with a "no archive" header, and
Gary Burnore has recently requested that his posts be removed from the DejaNews archives, the essence of their comments can still be followed via the portions of their posts which were quoted by others in posts that remain Which leaves two alternatives: either one of the participants in the Gary Burnore/Ron Guilmette/Netcom flame war was responsible, or the timing was merely coincidental.
Yes, the multiple copy thing was quite "ingenious", in an anti-remailer sort
of way.  They could either be viewed as a "friendly" warning about "abuse"
involving the remailers, or they could be viewed as abusive themselves.  But
since they, like the spam bait, were also sent through the remailers, the
remailer net was the visible target either way!
Several things didn't add up about the whole "spam baiting" thing.  While
Burnore claimed that he and other DataBasix users were the primary targets of
the spam bait, their addresses seemed to comprise only a small percentage of
the e-mail addresses I saw "baited".  My own test indicated that inclusion of
an e-mail address in the body of a Usenet post was ineffective in attracting
UCE.  And one of the most visible opponents of spam baiting, Peter Bell, said
pretty much the same thing.  He was apparently one of the original "spam bait"
targets, and would publish daily "reports" on which addresses were being
baited.  When the technique suddenly switched from individual messages with
addresses in the headers to the format where lists of addresses were instead
in the BODY of the message, he concluded, based on his observations, that the
new technique was ineffective and announced that he was discontinuing his
daily reports.
Despite this fact, the DataBasix folks continued to claim that they were
being inundated with e-mailed spam due to the ongoing spam baiting.  Of course, since the new technique involved e-mail addresses in the BODY of
the post, their suggested "solution" was to filter anonymous posts that
contained any mention of the e-mail addresses of DataBasix staff members.
Since such blockage was what they'd wanted all along, this new form of spam
baiting provided the ideal excuse for demanding that Usenet posts that
contained any reference to them be blocked.  Jeff Burchell's post indicated
that he originally acceded to this demand, but later admitted that it was
ill-advised and he discontinued it.

That makes about as much sense as holding a rally to protest auto theft and
requiring that each attendee leave his car UNLOCKED in the parking lot while
attending.  In this case, the price of admission to this "anti-UCE party" is
to contribute one's e-mail address to the UCErs' mailing lists!
And what, exactly, is the point of requiring "belligerant spammers and trolls" to post with a valid e-mail address?  Unless they're planning to
spam or mailbomb each other, they are the ones who have the least to fear
from publicly broadcasting their e-mail addresses on a worldwide NG for the
address harvesters to collect and exploit.

Unable to comply, for obvious reasons.
If an address points back to a real address, then it's not *ANONYMOUS*, Anon.penet.fi was *NOT* an anonymous remailer, though.  It was a "pseudonym
server".  The fact that it maintained a database by which posts could be
"traced back to a real address" is the main reason why it's no longer in
operation.  Maintaining that sort of information is an open invitation for
abuse by censorious elements, such as the "Church" of $cientology.
The chilling effect of knowing that identifying information is available for
abusive individuals and organizations to demand amounts to a form of
censorship through intimidation.
Ultimately, IMO, you harm the anti-UCE cause when you bundle it with an
anti-privacy agenda which requires broadcasting one's identity as the price
of free expression.
This message, for example, uses neither method to attain anonymity, yet it
would be banned from comp.org.cauce.

So would a message through a TRUE anonymous remailer (not a nymserver) that was PGP-signed with the same key used for other posts.  In fact, it would provide a more reliable correspondence between the post and its anonymous author than relying on a mere From: address in the header.  Yet the proponents of the CAUCE proposal insisted on a repliable (and mailbombable, spammable, etc.) address.  Why?
"Anononymous but traceable" is an oxymoron that necessarily depends on trusting a person who "holds the secrets".  The security of the anon.penet.fi remailer, for example, depended upon the ability of its operator to defend the security of its database against attacks from powerful, censorious elements such as the "Church" of $cientology.  Ultimately, it was unable to do so and chose to shut down rather to incur expensive litigation in defense of the privacy of its clients.
Not trusting such traceable schemes to protect one's privacy does not
"go far beyond the bounds of anonymity".  Calling any such scheme true
anonymity is nothing but SNAKE OIL.  The "fortress 'nym server" in which the
operator is not only personally trustworthy but also possesses the ability
to defend against any and all external attacks on the integrity of its
identifying database simply does not exist in the real world.
The fallacious assumption at work here seems to be that the validity of
an idea is somehow dependent on the identity of the messenger conveying
that idea.  Thus, the notion of "2+2=4" may not be valid if the identity
of the person stating it cannot be verified.  Personally, if I got a knock
on my door at 2 AM warning me that my house was on fire, I'd investigate
it, even I didn't know the person warning me.
The fact that identification through a unique, non-forgeable PGP signature
on each post was rejected but a repliable e-mail address was accepted as
that form of "accountability" casts doubt on the true motives behind this
requirement, though.
Real world experience on the internet should teach any objective observer
that a repliable e-mail address is no guarantee of "accountability".  The
presumption is apparently that any perceived misbehavior can be remedied
by either killfiling the person's e-mail address, or Net-copping the
individual and harassing his/her sysadmin into cancelling the account.
But how often have we seen Usenet spammers who can acquire new accounts
faster than the old ones can be killfiled or nuked?

Yeah, but poor Ron doesn't have a criminal arrest record like Gary does, despite Gary Burnore's unproven accusations, "big lie" campaign, crank calls to the FBI, etc.  Gary's charges get more and more fanciful.  Did you read

Not a shred of evidence for his lies, of course.  Fortunately for him,
Netcom harbors net abusers and Gary had to suddenly leave California for
North Carolina after his arrest in San Francisco.

This is the same looney maroon netcop who whined when somebody started posting

If you'd to expose ... er, I mean "reveal" yourself, be my guest. But knock off the bigotry -- anonymous posters are not going to be relegated
to the back of the bus just because some control freak is annoyed by hearing things with which he disagrees posted by people that he can't identify.  You're merely chanting the same line we've all heard over and over -- "unless you have something to hide, you won't mind my snooping and meddling in every aspect of your life".
Threats of "a lot of legal trouble" for speaking one's mind are nothing new.  But the tort of libel requires that the information be FALSE.  There's a difference between something being libellously false and merely being embarassingly true.  And, of course, the burden of proof is on the person making the charge.

^^^^^
Clever.  You and Gary demand "proof" of what you've said in the past, then you
attempt to conceal the very evidence you're demanding like this.  It figures.
Nothing like this, coupled with repeated false claims of "forgery", to give your posts a little "plausible deniability", is there?
Your obsessive disinformation campaign continues, I see...
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Well, if posting public information is OK, then why the hate campaign against Ron Guilmette and his business for (allegedly) doing like you and Gary did?
Actually, either you're lying now about the reason that Gary posted the info
back in February, or Gary was lying back then when he said: "What say each time you slam DataBasix for no reason, we post some publicly available information about monkeys.com.  HEre's the first try" and "More where this came from. Yu wanna keep slamming DataBasix for no good reason?". [1]  That sounds like an attempt at censorship through intimidation to me.  After you pull stunts like that is it any wonder that people post their opinions anonymously?  The more you attack anonymous remailers and their users, the
more people will see the benefit of utilizing them.
           ^^^^^
No, LIFE isn't, but, OTOH ...
Now I'm beginning to see why you weren't able to convince Jeff Burchell that
you were a "lawyer" for DataBasix when you tried the Scientology-esque stunt
of demanding that he turn all of his (non-existent) user logs over to
DataBasix to use in their witch hunt against the users of his remailer. [2] Going on a tantrum like that in a courtroom would get you jailed for contempt of court.
I see you haven't changed your typical DataBasix tactics of demanding proof
from others, but never bothering to offer any for your own accusations.  Like
the accusations that Ron Guilmette "spam baited" addresses at databasix.com.
(The only thing you've posted that even looked like evidence was some idle
talk about netcom.com addresses.)  Or how about that claim that Mr. Guilmette
supposedly "abused" an unnamed "teenage girl" at DataBasix?
As far as giving anonymous posters a bad name, since when have you EVER
had anything decent or civil to say about those who don't believe that setting one's self up for abuse should be the price of free speech?  Calling
anonymous posters "anon assholes" only betrays your pernicious bigotry and
hatred of those who dare to speak their minds without subjecting themselves
to the revenge that seems to (coincidentally?) befall those who dare to
criticize the almighty Sadaam Burnore.
As far as "delta sub-morons" engaging in "forgery" (assuming they aren't your
fellow "delta sub-morons" on the DataBasix gang) what about all the crude
attempts at forgery involving the e-mail addresses of those who've dared to
publicly disagree with Gary Burnore and his DataBasix wrecking crew?  What
about the letters in various MMF and MLM NGs saying "I have a lot of money
to invest, please send me information on how I can get rich quick" and
purportedly signed by these folks?  I must have missed your vehement
protests about that.
Did anyone force you to post THIS tantrum?  Don't let the door strike your posterior on the way out.
Once again, you post accusations without proof.  (Maybe I ought to do my
DataBasix impression of you and Sadaam Burnore stomping your feet and chanting in unison, "Not a shred of evidence! Not a shred of evidence!")
You can only say "I didn't do it, nobody saw me doing it, and you can't
prove a thing" so often.
Your post no evidence that such alleged abuse even occurred, nor that, *IF* it
did occur, it was perpetrated by someone other than you or one of your fellow abusers at DataBasix, perhaps as a pretext to get a remailer shut down.  If by your "former e-mail address" you're referring to an account at DataBasix.com,
could the real reason be that Gary is so technically inept that he has been
unable to get the databasix.com domain up and running after his hasty exodus
from California to North Carolina?  that's been his alibi -- "I
couldn't have posted any spam bait - databasix.com is still down".
Your whining is so hypocritical, anyway.  Where were those protests when your
fellow staffer at DataBasix, William J. McClatchie (aka "Wotan"), was busy
making THOUSANDS of e-mail addresses useless when he went on his successful
campaign to get the Mailmasher server shut down?  (Remember the bogus "forgery" charges and the pitiful "evidence" that was posted?)
Why?  You claim to have "plonked" him/her....
Why not just fix your newsreader?

Certainly there are people who will give up their privacy rights for
money.  Some of them will not perceive it as a problem.  Some will
have put themselves into a bad situation where the money is worth more
than their privacy.
In almost all cases their problems do not exist outside their minds.

that "bad" situation.  ("Bad" in quotes because if one really really

It is terribly important to recognize when people are in situations of
their own creation if we wish to advise people in ways to avoid such
situations or avoid them ourselves.
I completely disagree with this.  Read "Your Money or Your Life" by
Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin.  This book describes a method which
anybody can use to make good decisions in managing their life.  The
purpose of the book is to teach ordinary people how to become
independently wealthy.  There are few people who would not benefit
from this method and who are incapable of applying it.
You should also look at "The Millionaire Next Door" by Thomas
J. Stanley and William D. Danko.  This is a study of millionaires in
the United States.  To quote from "Money" magazine: "To learn what
today's millionaires have in common and how they accumulated their
wealth, Stanley and Danko sent questionnaires to affluent Americans
and conducted focus-group interviews.  They learned that about
two-thirds of those millionaires who still work are self-employed -
versus one in ten for all Americans.  The types of businesses they own
tend to be mundane, such as welding and dry cleaning.  The
overwhelming majority aren't trust-fund babies; eight out of ten
accumulated their riches themselves.  Most are extremely frugal.
Although their average net worth is $3.7 million, they generally live
so modestly that even their neighbors don't have a clue about their
The article has these five bullet points to recommend:
"1. Live below your means.
 2. Launch a savings and investing plan.
 3. Take on debt sparingly.
 4. Pay as little as possible to Uncle Sam.
 5. Start your own business."
Standard Ben Franklin stuff, but it works.
Actually, it doesn't cost much to change employers.  All you have to
do is find an employer who will hire you.  Mostly this is a question
of time and effort.
I agree most people will probably not pull it off, but that's too bad.
The reason they won't pull it off is that they won't make their best
effort.  Sure, you can dig up people who appear to have really tried
and then failed anyway, but they are rare.
You can easily see that most poor people are not making their best
effort by studying how much money they spend on alcohol, tobacco, or
other recreational substances.  You can also study TV watching habits.
Poor people watch a lot of TV instead of making themselves useful.
Gee, I don't know about that.  When I was in school there was
tremendous peer pressure to not study, to not get good grades, to not
program, to not study electronics, to not master calculus,
etc. etc. etc.  If those people end up poor, I have no hesitation in
saying they deserve it - at the very least!
I think I hear violins! ;-)
In practice, these are very seldom the choices that are being made.
Winter coats are available second hand for almost nothing.  When I was
a kid my parents made many of our presents by hand to save money.
Christmas need not be expensive, and it's not clear that it is
improved in any meaningful way by spending lots of money.
People are perfectly capable of living economically and making
good decisions, even when their children are involved.
(In> is Tim May, quoted by Harka.)
Uh, excuse me, but I didn't see Tim volunteering for Santa Claus duty.
Why should he help out people who will, in all probability, fail to
take his advice, squander any money he gives them, and resent him for
his efforts?
For that matter, why should he help out people who will be eternally
grateful if he doesn't value that gratitude?
And the claim that all that is needed is a little startup money is a
standard lame excuse that has probably been used for millenia.  Making
excuses is not how the job gets done.
The term "equal opportunities" is a curious one.  A free market does
mean that everybody has the equal opportunity to make agreements with
each other.  But, clearly some people will have more success making
these agreements for reasons which are not under their control.
Somebody might have parents who introduce them to the right people and
show them the ropes, for instance.  This is one reason why the free
market does not eliminate the formation of elites.  But, so what?  Are
we really going to claim that people shouldn't help their children to
In the sense that I think you mean the term, "equal opportunities" are
exceedingly undesirable.

[Ed. note: Declan wrote?:]
This greatly underestimates the influence and involvement of the
The medical profession uses the government to keep out competitors and
keep their prices high.  In many areas, the majority of the money
spent on legislative campaigns is provided by various professional
medical organizations.
The flip side is that the medical profession will have a powerful
incentive to remain in the good graces of the established political
powers, whatever they may be.
That means no weird experiments in protecting people's privacy.
Doctors are also terribly vulnerable to liability suits.  As patients,
we are unable to agree to waive most liability.  This makes it harder
to walk into a doctor's office with a sheaf of bills and ask for
service.  The doctor has a strong incentive to have everything
documented and ship shape because to do otherwise would make him or
her look poorly in court.  This may also endanger the doctor's
liability insurance policy.
And, because the medical market is tightly controlled, it is not
possible to legally enter the market as an outsider.  IMNSHO, I should
be able to consult my drug dealer about ailments and their proper
medication.  The fact is, many people have much greater rapport with
their drug dealers than with their doctors and there is often greater
concern by the drug dealer for his client's welfare, at least in terms
of obvious problems such as pain.
Similar things can be said for health insurance companies.  They are
very greatly constrained in the types of policies they can offer and
the sorts of agreements they can make with their customers.  You could
imagine an anonymous policy which opens with a medical exam which is
repeated every so often for couple of years before taking effect.
After, say, two years of good health, full coverage on the policy
kicks in.
Ironically, some states have rules very much like this, minus the
anonymity.  After a certain number of years all illnesses are covered
regardless of whether the customer had the illness previously and lied
about it on their application.  (Some states even forbid life
insurance issuers from excluding suicide for coverage for long term
customers!  Not only does this raise the price of life insurance, but
in certain instances it compels people to kill themselves "for the
good of their family". )
Given this legal environment, you would expect some company some where
to try to corner the market on anonymous health insurance.
There are a few reasons why this does not happen.
One is the extreme discretionary power of insurance commissioners.
This power is probably even greater than in most industries because
the insurance industry is, absurdly, widely hated.  No insurance
company is going to rock the boat.
Insurance regulation also creates a barrier to entry.  Many states
limit the amount of profit an insurance company can make.  These
limits are often very low and do not justify new entrants or new and
interesting product offerings.
Finally, in practice very few people choose their own insurance.  The
purchase decision is made indirectly by the company they work for.
The feedback between what the user of insurance wants and what he or
she gets is attenuated by this structure.
This structure is required by law in many places because employers are
required to provide "free" health insurance to their employees.  The
federal tax code strongly encourages companies to provide health
insurance as it is a benefit which is not taxed as income.
There is more to be said on this topic, I am sure.

@_subject: Protocols for Insurance to Maintain Privacy 
I've thought about this some more and there is a way to do this that
at least works in theory.
Let's say there are 30 DNA markers to be used to uniquely identify a
physical person.  When creating the contract, the customer creates 30
hashes based on each marker.  Prior to the time the customer has a
health problem, privacy is well assured assuming he or she doesn't
have a blood sample taken forcibly.
When the customer goes in for treatment, the insurer selects at random
one of the 30 markers and verifies it.  If it checks out, treatment is
provided.  The way to prevent people from trying to get lucky on the
markers is for the customer and the insurer to make a bet before the
test.  This is a safe bet for the customer - he or she knows the
outcome.  If the odds and payoff are set correctly, it's a good deal
for the insurer, too, because he or she will make money on fraud
Let's take the worst case: only one of the 30 marker is different.
Let's say the insurance contract consists of a health bet with a
payoff of $100,000 if the ailment insured for is found.  If the
customer is willing to bet $3 million that any marker selected will be
correct, the insurer breaks even.  However, since the customer knows
with certainty the outcome of the bet, he or she is safe betting
(theoretically) any amount.  This can be set arbitrarily high so that
the insurer actually stands to make a substantial amount of money off
fraud attempts.
In practice some provision will have to be made for people who can't
arrange the $3 million, such as taking fraud artists out to the
parking lot and shooting them.
And there still needs to be a way for one DNA marker to be tested for
in a way which guarantees that none of the others are studied.
Perhaps when the customer goes in, he or she takes samples of DNA with
all thirty markers.  When the insurer selects a particular marker, a
blood sample is drawn, and the customer puts in DNA with the 29 other
markers so that it will not be possible to study any marker other than
the one intended.
If each insurance contract is linked to only one type of illness, then
the only information revealed is that somebody with one particular DNA
marker had such and such an illness.  This seems pretty secure.

Prologue 17/0 -- SPACE ALIENS HIDE MY DRUGS!!!
Yo PsychoPukes!
I am sending this alcoholonymously so that only those who are
connected to the ScotchServer will be able to transylvaniate
the chalice filled with the blood of my martyrdom and nibble
on the edge of the 'crackers' diagnosis of my body, in order
to Divine which porn-movie star I am currently channeling,
thus being able to monitor and properly categorize both the
level and quality of shit which I am about to spew forth in
yet another rambling diatribe on the various ways in which
my dichotomous insanities relate to crypto and privacy, and
are therefore relevant to the BikerSucks Distributors List.
Although I am capable of telling all manner of outrageous lies
under cover of my usurptation of the multi-user TruthMonger
persona, in my role as the pathetic, drunken ScotchMonger, I
am incapable of rising above any level beyond wallowing in
a self-pitying confession of moral failures and character
weaknesses which anyone with even a modicum of self-respect
would refrain from revealing to God, Himself, let alone to
The Dark Allies of the Oppresor (TM) have descended upon my
personage and taken a large byte out of my ass by wiping out
my WebSite and confiscating my computers, as well as those of
my guilty-bystander nephews.
As much as I would like to portray myself as a 'martyr for
the cause' of free speech and privacy, the whole affair pretty
much boils down to the fact that I am pretty much a mentally
deranged shit-disturber who would salute the flag and spend
my whole day singing 'God Save The Queen' if I was told that
it was illegal or socially unacceptable to do so.
Add to this the fact that I have long been involved in a variety
of illegal and illicit nefarious activities that I have little
capacity to understand, and I can pretty much be written off as
a sorry loser who pretty much deserves to be used as cannon
fodder in the war between those with connections to opposite
poles of the ClueServer.
In regard to the undeniable reality of being an ignorant schill
useful as a protective buffer between my Muppet Pastors and
Brogue Brothers willing Prawns, I can only say that I am proud
to have been able to offer my services as a loudmouth asshole
in the furtherance of a cause that it is beyond my intellectual
capacity to fully understand.
The Good News (TM) is that anyone reading this rambling, semi-
coherent missive can rest assured that the details of what I
am sharing have no need of embellishment, since I, myself, play
absolutely no part in my current role, being merely a sorry,
pathetic dupe of those whose mental faculties have not been
decimated by years of alcohol and drug abuse.
My career as an international recording artist and touring
musician was nothing more than a charade designed to disguise
my mental aberrations under the cover of an acceptable long-
haired country outlaw persona.
My career as 'The World's Foremost Computer Expert' was equally
a charade designed to disguise my technical and professional
incompetence under the cover of an image as an eccentric genius.
The foregoing being said, let me share with you a few things
which make me laugh until I pee my pants, drop my dime, and
mess my drawers.
Since the original release of 'The Xenix Chainsaw Massacre' in
1989, I have gathered a following of hackers, crackers, phreaks,
phracks, punks and mental cybermisfits that would provide a
lifetime of research for any psychologist whose goal was to study digitally-based insanity.
Recently, those who have spent years feeding me information to
be released on an "I don't have the foggiest idea what it means"
basis, went underground, for the most part, as  a result of a
variety of attacks directed toward them by those who wish to
control and manipulate each and every aspect of the Brave New
Digital World.
Nonetheless, today I got a syruptacious message from the grand
personage known only as the Evil-1, informing me that, although
the Usual Suspects involved in taking control of my InterNet
accounts have faded into the background, due to a sharp rise in
the monitoring of my account, unknown player/warriors have come
out of nowhere to throw a serious fuck into the ISP which so
high-handedly murdered my WebSite, without a single word of
explaination to myself or anyone else.
The Evil-1, sending me a private email (using the
SysAdmin account at the Well), informed me that some kind soul
has turned the programs used to surrupticiously monitor my email communications into global programs which perform the
same tasks on the account of each and every customer of my
ISP, thus tying their tubes in a knot that  cannot be undone
by anyone they have on staff, or by the professional computer
spooks that have been imported to build a coherent conspiracy
out of my mad ramblings.
As well, a dear lady friend (who has been instumental in making
the dev.null server a living reality for the better part of a
decade) informs me that a variety of hackers and crackers who
are only peripherally connected to the HyperPukes Distraught
Baleing-Twine List, seem to be involved in accessing my ISP's
computers to perform mysterious tasks that have purposes that
even she cannot divine, with the enormous amount of tools and
resources at her fingertips.
To quote her directly, "The esteemed Lost Alamo Boys and Girls
4-H(orsemen) Club is unanimous in their opinion that the highly
professional and superbly trained guerilla units of the Magic
Circle are in no way superior to the unknown entities currently
crawling out of disparate locations of the cyberwoodwork to
lend a confusing hand to a common goal which is shared by none
and championed by all."
In short, it seems be the general consensus among those who have
spent years dogging my CyberTrail as a result of my use as an
expendable schill suitable to act as a front-man/target for the
dissemination of innocuously dangerous manuscripts, that the
'creme de la creme' of ZOG's MeatSpace CyberGestapo is sucking
hind-tit to an untraceable, unorganized, Cult of One/Army of Dog
pseudo-phenomena that is very likely composed mostly of Doodze
and Doodzettes who spend more on Clearasil than the NSA and DOD
spend on computer security, combined.
Lest you, as a CypherPinko, think you can get away with dismissing
the preceding as the mad ramblings of a psychotic, drunken, mental
case under the influence of bizarre combinations of legal and illegal drugs (which is, actually, the case), stop and think about
the things that you, yourself, have done over the course of your career as a part-time miscreant, during which you have performed inexplicable feats of derring-do which were far beyond your capacity, given your technological expertise and experience, but which were brought to successful fruitation by virtue of the clarity of purpose and the strength of committment that you brought to the activity.
If you have made a habit of selling yourself short for your seeming
accomplishments because you convinced yourself that you, and your
accomplishments, are 'ordinary', then you need to review your life,
your actions, and your accomplishments, while keeping a Taoist eye
open, and a Taoist ear cocked, for the subtle signs of a Magic at
work which goes beyond Mathematics and steps into the arena where
Conscious Will defines the paridigms within which Reality is manifest according to the dictates of Dreams and Desire.
Despite my obvious dysfunctionality in a world which demands a strict
adherence to the Norm (TM), I reign supreme as a Prophet and Conspiracy
Theorist Extraordinaire.

Anyone who honestly researches the wildest of the claims made in
the 'True Story Of The InterNet' manuscripts will be able to prove
for themselves the reality of even the most preposterous of the
wild and weird pronouncements of collusion between a far-reaching
network of Circle of Eunuchs conspirators.
Those who check the details surrounding the warnings to Jim Bell
shortly before his persecution, the arrival of the son of gomez
on the doorstep of his mentor mere hours before gomez was cut
loose from a company he had founded a decade and a half earlier,
the synchonicitous messages from the L.M. Boyd sampler and the
A.Word.A.Day bulk emails mirroring releases of the 'True Story'
manuscripts, the coincidences of timing between major events in
the story of the Unabomber and the activities of the Author, ad
Those who diligently and honestly check the MeatSpace details
surrounding the space-time continuum of these events will be
left with no doubt that the true, discernable facts surrounding
the events are perfectly consistent with the claims of the
'True Story' manuscripts that there is an underground movement
in the computer industry which supports, confirms and enhances
the work of separate guerilla cells working independently, yet
within a concrete and discernable paradigm encompassing a common goal.
The Truth, The Whole Truth, And Nothing BUT The Truth:
[Note from the Otter: I have every reason to believe that
 I am currently 'marked for deletion' from the List (TM)
 of those whom the DickMongers can't be bothered butt-
 fucking just yet, so anyone who dares to suggest, in the
 remotest corner of their mind, that I have anything to
 be gained by embellishing or distorting the Truth in  regard to my most dearly held beliefs, based on my life
 experiences...can go fuck themselves.
 OTOH, anyone who wishes to discount what I am about to
 say on the basis that I am a drunken, psychotic drug-
 addict with a slim hold on Reality (TM) probably has
 a case that would hold up when pleaded before a jury
 of Phillip Hallam-Baker's peers.]
All of the wild and preposterous claims made in the
'True Story of the InterNet' manuscripts, in regard to the verifiable trails of intrigue connecting the Author
with the pesonages and events of a wide variety of deeply meaningful events in the battles between the
Forces of Light and the Forces of Darkness taking place
on the battlegrounds in Waco, Ruby Ridge, San Diego,
Sacramento, etc., etc., are Total HorseShit (TM) in
the world of MeatSpace, and Totally True (TM) in the
world of Reality (TM).
You see, Reality (TM) is nothing more nor less than the fulfillment of the totality of our individual thoughts, beliefs, hopes, dreams and actions. And the
Spheres of Reality encompass physical and virtual territories ranging from the MeatSpace and MindSpace
bounded by an individual Cult of One persona, to the
time-space continuum bounded by Infinity and Eternity.
In short, when the Author's missives are supported and confirmed by a web of totally unrelated facts and circumstances which consistently mirror the wild and
outlandish claims being made, it is because when any
living entity in the universe takes a step in a self-
willed direction, the underlying fabric of the Tao
changes shape to bring itself into alignment with the
consciously willed goal of that entity.
The True Battle (TM) taking place within the confines
of MeatSpace Reality is the battle of conscious, self-
willed individuals writing Reality Scripts capable of
balancing and/or overcoming the Generic Reality being
written by the more numerous Sheeple following the Scripts written by their Masters.
Women and men who consciously contribute to the daily
construction of Universal Reality influence the basic
structure of the Universe to a greater degree than a greater number of Sheeple who are heading in a different direction, but who scatter back and forth,
being kept only intermittently on course by the dogs
which nip at their heels.
"Let us each choose a Vision,
 Let us each choose a Dream.
 Let us each write a Chapter of Life,
 On our own Silver Screen."
~ 'You Can't Kill A Dream, Or A Dreamer', C.J. Parker
Anyone who wishes to join Tim May in dismissing the preceding as an example of laughable 'Magical Thinking"
having forgetten that Mr. May is simply a senile old fart who can't even find his shoes, is free to do so.
However, no amount of skepticism and derision will change the fact that the sincerely professed insanity
contained in the 'True Story' manuscripts lead to an
incontrivertable confirmation of their validity within
the confines of the MeatSpace time-space continuum running parallel to their release.
Anyone who wishes to avoid facing the reality of what
is being suggested in this rambling missive by a mentally unstable, alcoholic, drug-addicted terrorist
pedophile, in order to preserve the sanity that can
be maintained by dismissing the Truth when it leaks
from the lips of the deranged and depraved, should avoid reading the chapters of 'Space Aliens Hide My
Drugs' which lightly tread the boundaries of Unfortunately, mathematics, biology, physics and psychology are rapidly converging around a model of
the universe which suggests that each and every entity capable of receiving, emitting, categorizing
and acting on information data and processes ranging
from the inherent structure of DNA to convoluted
discourses on Quantum Physics, is not just a 'product' of its universal environment, but also an active 'creator' of that universal environment.
In short, though you may easily dismiss my wild claims that the ramblings of a mad Author are actively
creating the universe which you inhabit, it is highly
unlikely that you will be able to avoid the semi-
sensible posts of Jim Choate to the list concerning
those who are defining the new frontiers of science
with provable theories every bit as nonsensical as
those of Einstien, or be able to ignore the highly
organized trails of hard facts and figures provided
by John Young's website, confirming the bizarre reality of the Author's neurological nightmares and Choate's cutting-edge scientific dreams being brought
to fruitation and manifested in the established MeatSpace chronicles which Dr. Young provides for
the edification of unbelievers, during the functional
periods of lucidity he experiences in between his
mad rampages into the depths of drug-induced insanity.
In effect, those who fail to understand the true import
of the Biosemiotic basis of the conjoined evolution of
mind and matter are doomed to exit this life still
believing that they were predestined to become a side-pocket combination shot of Universal Fats, the
prime mover of all that exists, instead of realizing
that, at any point in time, they were free to change
the nature and direction of the Game (TM) by declaring,
"Damn the CueBall, full speed ahead!"

Yeah, this is just the kind of thing that Americans, even
with their severly dulled sense of freedom, will run right out to buy! Sure. First we can expect to see the
feds mandate this for all government purchases, then at
some point mandate the chipset for all computers, then
outlaw encryption that doesn't use the chipset. And I
don't even own a crystal ball anymore!
OK, I give up. Where is the tamper resistance for the Constitution? Is anybody working on that? HEL-lo????

This guy is living his elitist life looking through rose colored glasses, with blinders on, in a vacuum, with his head buried in sand, with his neck snugly supported by his sphincter muscles.
"vision"?.... "sophisticated"?.... what is this?  If people disagree or are more cynical about what the government may or may not do concerning cryptography we are less sophisticated and/or lack vision?  What an idiot!!  Wake up and smell the bullshit you and others like you are shoveling.  McCain is a serious control freak (former AZ resident who has seen him in action) and will never, regardless of his vomitous, pendulous rhetoric, support a domestic "free encryption" standard without government controls, there will always be a catch.

Stan is an asshole, an annoyance on this list. I've killfiled anything with his email address in any header. I suggest everyone do the same. When he gets no responses to anything he posts, he will eventually go away, probably to where "Liberals Go To Die." If you encourage him, I won't see your responses.  I don't wade through the blizzard of this list to have to wipe splashes of airhead liberal shit out of my eyes at every other step.

I was wondering if anyone knows of such a creature that I could send email to with an URL, and I would get a reply of that HTML file?
example I emailï¿½ï¿½ bot at somewhere.com with the and I will get an email of the HTML file at This would be handy because I don't have a broswer (2 meg RAM (I know)) and also for anonymity, cookies etc I couldn't be traced.
Actually you can do that really very easily. If you are interested in such Bot's. I really recommend you get O'Reilly's book: Web Client Programming, with Perl. It discusses to a large degree what your wanting to do. It has full source code as well, so you can take that and just fiddle with a bit until it suits your needs. Provided you or someone you know can program in Perl. I think one method you could do is to just use a majordomo server and tinker with it to suit the reception needs. Or you could on your own box, or a friends box. Make an account to the name you want, set up a resident program, with nohup or a simple cron job. Or do some script, that would serve equally as well. That could handle the reception facilities well enough. Then just use the modified bot to handle the HTML queries and sending and there you go. Although sending things back to the HTTP server in question might... interesting. If that place GET and POST methods for CGI scripts and dynamic pages, that raises some questions. Particularly, if the bot sends you the HTML doc that it requested, you view the page, yadda yadda yadda. It depends on how you want to work it and do it, you have to ask yourself. Do I want to send my request (whatever that maybe)from my machine? The request would go through. But it would be through your machine, and that would invalidate your anonymity. So thats a Bad Thing(tm) and out of the question. Or in cases like yours, the user might not have a browser. So that leaves it to us sending our request back to our automated little daemon and it does it for us. It would require just a little bit of handling and work to do the GET and POST methods for the CGI program your interacting with, but that would be minimal I think. I could be wrong however. In effect your using the bot as a kind of proxy for HTTP requests. If your really, REALLY desperate I might be able to quickly just put something together for you and post it here for you(or if another cypherpunk thats into Perl wants to do it, or if anyone else has any ideas). But you should be able to modify the code to suit whatever you want it to do. I've been experimenting with something similar, only on a slightly different note. If your patient, you can just subscribe to a majordomo "admin-help" list. Where the details of running such a thing are discussed by people that do. I'm sure one quite possibly exists somewhere. Then log on to a Bot mailing list and after hanging out on both for a while, asking a few questions perhaps you should be able to put something together I expect.
Or as mgraffam at mhv.net suggests you could log into those machines and do it that way. Which gives me another idea, you could have the bot run lynx remotely and then pipe the output from that to the letter it would send you and visa versa. But that makes things more complicated as well too. I question the value of doing that as well, I think the overhead would be a bit much, as well as being a slight hassle. I think over all, the easiest thing to do would be to possibly follow mgraffam's suggestion and just do that. Those are my thoughts on things at least. I hope they help.
I think the security possibilities of such a bot could be useful and could make a interesting discussion perhaps. There was one thread earlier that was discussing one such robot. From a government location, that was keeping tabs on crypto related sources. Crawling from link to link, from behind a firewall etc, etc, etc. If theres any more news relating to that thread, thats been uncovered I'd be interested in hearing more on it.

Life's too short for this crap. Perhaps it's worth trying to reason with people a bit:
Victorian times, like ours today, were a period of huge changes, which meant behavioral changes. It cannot be an accident that manners, good form, and respectable society merged into the legendary image of modern social graces. It was done of efficiency, and, so, of necessity.
Inefficient entities decay in capitalism. Manners were needed for efficiency. Only today do they seem quaint, or insulting of class or social station. They were where the action was, among professionals trying to forge new economic relationships.

I found what you're looking for.  I failed in my search at the FCC and ARRL web-sites, except for offers to purchase the applicable regulations in hardcopy.
C.F.R. 47, Part 97 covers the Amateur Radio Service.  The full set of regs is available at:
The specific regulation you're looking for is at: S 97.113 Prohibited transmissions. (a) No amateur station shall transmit:         (4) Music using a phone emission except as specifically
            provided elsewhere in this Section; communications
            intended to facilitate a criminal act; messages in
                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^
            codes or ciphers intended to obscure the meaning
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
            thereof, except as otherwise provided herein;
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
            obscene or indecent words or language; or false
            or deceptive messages, signals or identification; The exception clause probably makes reference to an allowed "code", that being morse code.

This is enforced very strictly, with the diligent help of the amateur
radio community itself.
CFR47 says:
97.113 Prohibited transmissions. (a) No amateur station shall transmit:
  (1) Communications specifically prohibited elsewhere in this part;
  (2) Communications for hire or for material compensation, direct or
  indirect, paid or promised, except as otherwise provided in these
  rules;
  (3) Communications in which the station licensee or control operator
  has a pecuniary interest...
  (4) Music using a phone emission except as specifically provided
  elsewhere in this section; communications intended to facilitate a
  criminal act; messages in codes or ciphers intended to obscure the
  meaning thereof, except as otherwise provided herein; obscene or
  indecent words or language; or false or deceptive messages, signals
  or identification;
  (5) Communications, on a regular basis, which could reasonably be
  furnished alternatively through other radio services.
(b) An amateur station shall not engage in any form of broadcasting...
97.117 International communications. Transmissions to a different
country, where permitted, shall be made in plain language and shall be
limited to messages of a technical nature relating to tests, and, to
remarks of a personal character for which, by reason of their

looking around on various crypto sites I can't find any hashes ported to dos/win that are already compiled is anyone out there aware of a place with a copy o MD5 or SHA1 and my second question,  I was also curious about PGP.  In the latest version (cyberknights build) You can use 8kbits DH key or a 16Kbits RSA key,  In my reasoning I would think that since DH was out before RSA and RSA was chosen for the first releases of PGP why switch to DH now, if it was better why not start out using that?
