@_subject: Draft of Commerce Department Crypto Regs (fwd) 
Steptoe and Johnson have kindly posted the draft Commerce Department
regulations on encryption exports at Of most interest to those of us concerned about the First Amendment is the
provision which eliminates the "publicly available" exception to the EAR and
states "controlled software will not be eligible for "publicly available"
treatment, even if the source code or object code is published in a book or
other mdia."
It also eliminates the exceptions for educational information and
fundamental research contained in the EAR for source code and object code.
I haven't had a chance to review the rest in any detail.

If CBS news is yet to air in your area, it is well worth your time
to see, and perhaps record. Phil came off very well.

Gemini Thunder sez:
You must understand that the USG faces a VERY big hurtle in
attempting to ban the book. Books have a history; one as old as the
Founding Fathers, older than the country and the Constitution, of
being protected.
In fact, this extends to other printed material; i.e newspapers.
They tried and failed to get "prior restraint" in the Pentagon
Papers case.
But in their quest to sandbag an already submerged dike, they hope
they can draw a line at magnetic media. It's untested, IMHO likely
to fail, but it's a hell of a lot better than trying to ban books.
They'd get laughed out of court.

Dale Thorn sez:
I doubt it. When first granted access to classified, you must sign a
civil contract not to publish anything without clearing same. That
restricts your actions. But if you are writing a book, and the New York Times learns details
by other than you telling them [To use a favorite of this group; one
I scoff at as it's made to "look easy" -- let's say the NYT used
Tempest techniques..], then can the USG go after the NYT and engage
prior restraint? No, in my understanding.
I hedge cuz this came about as a result of Phillip Agee [sp] but I
do not recall exactly when.

My uncharitable side says that is because they wanted to stay as far
away from cries of "book-banning" as they could. If nothing else, IN
THAT NARROW CASE, reason prevailed over fervor.
And I caution against thinking in terms of "NSA did" in favor of
"Under FBI pressure, NSA did" just to remind ourselves where the
real battle lies.....

As a HP-35 buyer when they first appeared in '72, I sonn found it
simple to explain RPN by using a basic rule of good composition:
avoid passive voice.
The "+" key is not, of course "plus" rather it is the active voice
term "add" and such.. And all commands are "active voice" unlike
a TI where some were...
Of course, I soon found far too many people had no grasp of active
vs. passive voice........

Bill Frantz sez:
I missed how this got the 'Punk material, but a friend is running
parts of a test of this.
The en-route radar is roughly the same age as those IBM 360's in the
Centers that you keep hearing about. The current approach is radar, [?2 ghz] with interrogation of a
1 ghz transponder via the same array. The xponder has 4 octal digits
and {Mode C} the altitude from an accompanying encoding altimeter.
So the alternate approach is a GPS receiver with a transponder
replying to interrogations with position and altitude. For the most
part, in the "en-route" stage, the futzing by DOD is not a concern

   Below is the proposed plan for the organization structure and fee
   schedule. The organization will have more detailed bylaws which will
   be ratified by the Board of Trustees.
   An annual membership fee of $1,000 will be charged to all entities
   joining the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN). Membership
   is open to any entity/individual wishing to join, regardless of
   whether the entity/individual receives address space directly from
   ARIN. Membership is not a requirement for receiving address space from
   ARIN.

  SECTION 2.3 ISP REGISTRATION FEE
   If an ISP moves from a Small to a Medium category (for example) in the
   same year, the ISP will be charged the difference.
   Small $2500/year /24 - /19 Medium $5000/year >/19 - /16 Large
   $10K/year >/16 - /14 X-Large $20K/year >/14

There's a low-tech solution. There's a stock GSA form for recording

Think along those lines, perhaps.
