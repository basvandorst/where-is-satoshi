I guess this sort of thing does involve extradition rules. For example,
Sweden has a Nazi party, which would offend Germans, who can, I'm
sure, see them on TV leave alone on the Net. Sweden's Information
(or something) Ministry has said that by law anyone can start
a party, but if the Nazis due something illegal (such as killing
people, or threatening them) the courts will handle it.
And Norway is not even _in_ the EU.

@_subject: Flaw in Netscape rejoinder (was Re: FV Demonstrates Fatal Flaw in Software Encryption of Credit Cards) 
This is all getting unnecessarily complicated. As I pointed out
in another post ("FV's blatant double standards") NO SYSTEM FOR
SECURITY IS SAFE when one allows for recipient compromise, i.e. privileged access to a recipient's system by a malicious program.
Easy or difficult is not the point. In DOS it's possible for any program,
in Unix only for those with root access. Security fails when it is
not possible to make a distinctionbetween a program that _should_ have access and one that _shouldn't_. Anyone who's tried to teach
novice DOS users what to do when one of those anti-virus TSR tools
complains that something is doing something it shouldn't will know
how hard it is for _users_ to guard themselves.
I would think that most viruses are transmitted by floppy
disk, even now, or by programs _intentionally_ downloaded
and _intended_ to patch the OS (such as a screen blanker). The possibility of mass net-based creepy-crawlies has been
remote due to the uniquely multi-platform nature if Internet
protocols; they're Unix-based, but end-users have PCs. Only
metaplatforms such as Java, perlCCI, Telescript could change

@_subject: Domain hijacking, InterNIC loopholes 
My new ISP got the domain modified in a day, or so. The proces
_is_ automated, as long as you follow the template perfectly.
More to the point, the InterNIC informs all the major nameservers
(such as ns.nasa.gov and all those that mirror ns.internic.net). Obviously. Without that, how would anyone know where to find your
domain (even if 'hijacked')? But I never did say domain hijacking
was a security threat - unlike spoofing, this can't in itself
compromise your systems. But, as the InterNIC admits, it can have "serious consequences" on commercial organisations, for whom
the loss of net presence for even a day could be considerable.
You obviously didn't get the point. There are no routers involved
at all, or even nameservers. The Internet domain registry structure
(unlike much else) is strictly hierarchic - the InterNIC is the source
of all. Modify the InterNIC record, and the new record is official,
and will be promptly accepted by all the nameservers that bother to track these things.
Again, whether the sysadmin eventually catches on is not the point.
Unless the hijacker is exceptionally sophisticated (by, for
example, not interrupting but only intercepting web and mail traffic) and the victim exceptionally stupid, the truth will be
known soon. But perhaps not soon enough for, say, Hotwired or
Yahoo who can't afford to go down.
To drive my point home: suppose the owners of (yes, it does exist) were to hijack hotwired. Further suppose that they mirrored (or otherwise replicated) hotwired's content, displaying it to users with some nasty changes, and filtering
out all complaint mail. One assumes HotWired's admins are savvy
enough to think of this, but you never know, and if they took
a few days or more over fixing it, it would not be nice for them.
Of course, their lawyers wouldn't make it nice for howtired
either, if they had their address, and it wasn't in ... China!

@_subject: Domain hijacking, InterNIC loopholes 
The confirmation message is sent to the address
requesting an update. This could be anyone. To take
a real example, my dxm.org domain was modified by
hostmaster at best.com - neither the existing admins,
nor root at dxm.org received any confirmation, as the request
was sent from another address. The InterNIC does NOT
require domain update requests to be sent by admins - that is, in fact, the simplest level of authentication
that will be introduced by the InterNIC Guardian Object.

India's Department of Telecommunications (DoT) charges a licence
fee of $50,000 per _annum_ for BBS operators, and nearly twice
as much for e-mail providers. It is preparing to finalise a policy
for Internet service providers; as it doesn't understand the distintion
between Internet _networks_ (MCI, Sprintnet etc) and "retail" providers
(the geek in the garage), it is planning to charge well over $100,000
in annual licence fees. This is totally against the opinions of Telecom
Secretary R K Takkar, as expressed to my newsletter, The Indian Techonomist, some months ago. I spoke to Mr Takkar for some time, providing him the "education" that he asked for in my newsletter and that large datacom companies here have been curiously averse to give him. He appreciated my point of view, and
invited me to send a proposal for an alternative datacom policy, which
I have done (and which is summarised below). I hope to meet him next week to follow this up. As a major part of my call for removing restraints is based on the Internet's treatment by other world governments, I would like letters of support to show this. My proposal may appear tame, but it isn't really. It will allow small
ISPs to pay as little as $150 a year in licence fees; reduce the (high)
likelihood of cartels between large companies; and entrench electronic
free-speech at (some) parity with other media. (Note that the DoT has
said that it is "not considering" blocking access to parts of the Net
for reasons of morals or security. This despite the local media's loudly
proclaimed discovery that the Net is 97.34% paedophile, or whatever.)
     Highlights
     1. Definitions
     - The category for E-mail providers becomes redundant,
       leaving international gateway, national network, and
       "retail" service providers
     - Content providers have constitutional protection as
       electronic publishers
     - BBSes do not require licensing, being content providers
     2. Goals
     - Licence fees not for revenue generation, but to
       ensure responsibility (unavoidable. Mr Takkar's words)
     - Licence fees based on telecom infrastructure costs,
       not revenues (at the moment, a licence is almost like income tax)
     - Regulation required for free and fair competition (see below)
     - TRAI should also handle datacom regulation, and datacom consumer
       complaints (the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India is likely
       to be very independent of the government, headed by a former
       Supreme Court judge)
     3. Regulation
     - Equal access to gateway, network and service
       providers (to prevent denial of service and cartels, very
       likely here without explicit rules preventing them)
     - Rationalisation of DoT leased line tariff structure
       (now, a network costs more than the sum of its parts! too        complicated to explain briefly)
     4. Licensing
     - Uniform fee structure for gateway, network and
       service providers (say 2.5% of leased line costs, which
       are known as they are provided by the DoT)
     - Barriers to entry greatly reduced (minimal ISP pays $150 p.a)
     - However, total licence fee revenue for DoT not
       significantly reduced (important for success of this proposal;
       large nationwide network may still pay $100,000+ thanks to its
       huge leased line requirements)
The full text of the proposal will be made publicly available on the
Net sometime next week. Those who would like to see it, and a template
for a letter of support, should send me mail at dcom-appeal at dxm.org.
I would like letters from non-commercial organisations, lobby groups,
policy bodies, and so on, but NOT datacom companies (I wouldn't
mind _personal_ letters of support from them, but they wouldn't do
for the DoT). I would particularly like to see something from Hong Kong,
which I have used as a good example of how to do things in Asia.

Indian datacom freed?
   by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh
February 16: Today, in a "brainstorming" session to discuss
the new datacom policy proposed by The Indian Techonomist,
the Department of Telecommunications indicated its
enthusiasm for a free datacom environment in India. As no
official decision has yet been taken, I cannot make the
details public for the moment. There is one exception: the
Telecom Secretary (and Chairman, Telecom Commission) R K
Takkar has made it quite clear that content providers in
cyberspace will receive all the free-speech protections
available to other media. Mr Takkar said that existing laws for obscenity and national security were enough for the Internet, and in any case were not the concern of the DoT. Mr Takkar said that there was no need to licence on-line content providers, and indicated that Internet service providers would not be responsible for illegal content, apparently implying common carrier status for ISPs.
The other parts of the proposal, relating to low entry
barriers for ISPs and free competition met with a largely
positive response. The full text of the proposal is now
available at Apart from Mr Takkar and myself, present at the meeting were
Telecom Commission Members P Saran and P Khan, as well as
some other senior DoT staff.
I would like to thank Vinton Cerf and Lawrence Landweber for
the support given by the Internet Society to the proposal.

@_subject: Hack attempt? "12 days" from anon.com 
Regarding the mysterious mail from mailer-daemon at anon.com
that many people have received:
1. The mail was apparently sent by a daemon bouncing
   an undeliverable mail. anon.com is a "virtual domain"
   hosted at io.com, so it's unlikely that the daemon would
   have an anon.com address. 2. Headers show it was routed through 38.10.221.81 and
   smtp1.interramp.com. That IP address showed up as
   ip81.la.ca.interramp.com the first time I tried a    traceroute. The second time it showed up as    ip81.syracuse.ny.interramp.com. In any case, traceroute
   went recursive between los-angeles.ca.isdn.psi.net
   (38.145.221.110) and lan.losangeles.ca.psi.net
   (38.145.221.1). This indicates the target could not be
   reached - perhaps it's a PPP address, or disconnected.
3. There is an X-Sender: (Unverified) header entry. So the
   mail was SMTP faked without the HELO protocol.
4. The error purpoting to originate from mailer-daemon at anon.com
   says the mail was addressed to PeppermintPty at loacst.org. loacst.org
   is not a registered domain.
5. PeppermintPty is obviously Peppermint Patty; the "original message"
   is signed Marcie. Peanut fans will recognise these characters.
So - what was it all about? An elaborate prank? A convoluted NSA
plot? I would lean towards the first, but perhaps we'll know
on March 1st, the date to "gain access to target".

@_subject: In favour of privacy legislation 
I agree that the legislation, as written, one of the shortest I've seen, is overbroad. However, it's not _that_ far off the mark. Most of your
objections (such as the one relating to unauthorised biographies, which are more likely to be challenged using existing libel laws than privacy legislation that doesn't specify penalties) can be answered with a simple
change: replace "personal information concerning an individual" with
"personal information concerning an individual directly gleaned from that
individual's statements or actions." Or something. So if you build
a database tracking my purchases at your store, or what I fill in
your subscription forms, you can't resell it. OTOH if you buy my
dossier from someone _else_, you're not liable, though your source
probably is. So you could publish biographies or political exposes
and only the primary source would be liable. That source is often liable in any case, due to existing laws concerning theft, trade secrets,
breach of contract etc; it's just that primary sources in these situations
are almost never identified.
Ah yes, this would include the 98.32% of Internet users who are paedophiles.
You don't believe that paedophiles and rapists deserve the same legal
and constitutional treatment as anyone else? "First they came for the Jews..."
These, along with databases on (proven) rapists, depend on policy for
the use of "public" - government-held - information on individuals.
In most countries, this is governed by widely distributed regulations,
not any single privacy law. For example, the European restriction on
publicising names of minors charged for serious offences _during_ trial.
If the simple change on direct sources is made, these do not impact
privacy legislation.
Legislation governing free speech in the US is huge. The body of law
that strengthens free speech (interpreting "Congress shall make"
as "any level of government shall make") and restricts it (taking
"no law" to mean "no law except to prevent obscenity, libel, etc")
goes far beyond the deceptively simple First Amendment, but this complexity and bulk is not a common argument against free speech legislation. The California bill, with some changes, may not
be a carefully constructed body of law but could be a decent start.
My personal opinion, living as I do between one country - India - that is still (fortunately?) fond of habitual civil disobedience, and another - the Internet - where civil disobedience is a technologically assisted
state of mind, laws are an irritation. But if they are to exist to
protect _some_ rights, they should, for aesthetic balance if nothing
else, exist for _all_.

@_subject: Domain hijacking, Guardian objects 
It is good that you're open to suggestions on the Guardian
bject draft, but is just me or have you been rather quiet about it? I haven't
seen this blared from the rooftops, or even discussed in security/admin
groups with anywhere near the prominence it merits.
My main worry with the latest draft is that it seems
rather daunting. That is perhaps not so important anymore, as
teh days of DIY domain registrations are over, with most people
going through ISPs (unless they're pretty experienced themselves).
And I wonder what you've planned to do about the huge existing
domain base. When you make the announcement, and include
guardians in domain forms, new registrations will be OK. But it
will be a free for all as far as the others are concerned -
as the same evil.org could register a Guardian Object for victim.com,
making it impossible for poor victim.com to do simply file another
(unauthenticated) update, as is possible right now. There will
be simply nothing InterNIC could do either, as the admin and technical
contacts will all be (guarded) addresses of the evil.org owners,
so verification will be almost impossible without legal action
(for which, mind you, some may hold the InterNIC liable).
Perhaps the solution would be NOT TO ALLOW GUARDIAN OBJECTS
TO COVER OLD DOMAINs (and hosts, etc).  At least, not initially.
When the next payment comes in to cover the entry, it should
include a Guardian object application, so that will authenticate
the association between the organisation in the real world of
money, and its Net presence. Another option would be to
prevent modification of domains and other objects that are
'known' to be static, such as mit.edu. I don't know how thei would be practical for most domains, though.
ps. a new peer-review journal on the Internet is starting soon, with
an editorial board full of big names. I'm the international
editor with  additional charge, as it were, for technical and
security issues.  This is an informal call for papers on not-
so-obvious security holes and bottlenecks, such as the InterNIC's
lack of authentication. I'd be interested in a paper on Guardian
Objects; I'm open to writers from within the InterNIC/NSI itself.

@_subject: encrypted cellphones 
As I remember from discussions with a GSM encryption programmer
(which I posted to this list months ago) GSM is secure enough to prevent
real-time decryption, as keys are changed frequently using another
secure protocol (A8 I believe). GSM  encryption is only supposed
to make people like Princess Diana more secure, that's all. This was
enough for Pakistan to temporarily shut down Motorola's GSM network
in Karachi last February, until they discovered they could
intercept calls simpply by sitting at the base stations where
they're decrypted...
