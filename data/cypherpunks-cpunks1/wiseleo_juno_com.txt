@_subject: your mail 
Well the obvious answer is to RTFM (Note: F is for fine) on DOS version,
its quite big. Also you seem to need Win PGP shell of some sort so that
you won't have to type those commands, i memorised my commands on the
3rd day of usage so no big deal about shells.
And then you cat'n'paste the code into your e-mail.
In some cases you can set it up as a spell checker ;)

@_subject: Encrypting ZIP disks 
Well, I think one way to find out is to create 2 identical zip disks and
encrypt them with different passwords. Then do sector by sector compare
and see where the beast is hiding at :)

Isn't it the future of internet advertising? I mean its just like Juno's
and other companies, the only ads shown to customers are those that are
relevant to their needs as submitted. Like do a search for web promotion
and you are gonna get ads of various services etc.
It is highly unlikely that detailed logs are kept since Alta-vista gets overwhelming number of hits. The way I go around all these ads is that I
use Internet Fast Find by symantec and I love it, I purchased it after
evaluating for 3 days. Sorry for commercial ;)
I think it is a good idea, no wonder doubleclick.net is one of the
leaders in advertising. You are shown only the ads that will potentially
interest you, search for shopping and you are gonna get one of those ISN
ads etc. I think it is a good idea FWIW.
I wouldn't think that a company such as doubleclick.net will do you any
One of my job assignments is Internet research and I search for such
variety of topics that those robots have no use on the information
On the other hand, if I find my site on Altavista and go to it, in my referer_log I will see the entire search query and that is a valuable
marketing information, you learn about how the customer found you etc.
Well, this list isn't marketing101 at anywhere.com so I am afraid I won't
bother with more thorough explation :)
I am sorry if you consider this an OFFtopic message but I am just
answering the question.
