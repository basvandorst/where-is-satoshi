@_subject: What happened to FEE 
I wonder what happened to the fast elliptical encryption (FEE) encryption software that NeXT was working on about two years ago? I heard that the US authorities took a very dim view of
it and I assume that this was because it was either very fast or very strong or both. Pardon my ignorance if this is an old
thread, but I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere for quite some
time and certainly not in the last month since I was on the
cypherpunks mailing list.

@_subject: Coffee, anyone? 
Hear! hear!
I really _like_ my coffee, and I'd hate to see all the interesting  people and discussions frightened off by excessive officiousness in the coffee shop.
