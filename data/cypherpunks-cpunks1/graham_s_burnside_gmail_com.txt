@_subject: [Freedombox-discuss] Guardian project GPG key sync 
I came across this page earlier  and thought I'd post it incase anyone hadn't seen it. There are plans for a system to sync GPG keys across devices using a number of methods, including tor hidden services.
There is plenty of interesting and useful projects here including a full implementation of gpg for android.
