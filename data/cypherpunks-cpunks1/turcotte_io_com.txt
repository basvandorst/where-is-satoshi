@_subject: Mandatory sig workaround 
Haven't been living in the BBS world much lately have you?  There was a monster
debate recently on Fidonet's Encryption Forum and some folks from Net 106
(Houston, TX, if I recall correctly) with some sysops in that region claiming that the signature was encryption and who were therefore bouncing things because they didn't want encrypted things on their boards.
Sigh....out in the world some *serious* education is needed.

Anyone else notice all of the inside the beltway plus NYC area types on this list....anyone want to bet on how much "newly required" intelligence capabilities will come out of this commission...

@_subject: Effects of S.314 (Communications Decency Act) 
And don't forget the recent case where the operators of a California bulletin board were prosecuted and convicted in court in Memphis....whereas they never would have been convicted under the community standards in California.  You want to talk about scary....there is a section in Robert Heinlein's "Job: A Comedy of Justice" where the protagonist describes some "moral" codes that they got passed...one of them was having the community standards of the median size community of the state apply to all communities in the state.   What's the betting out there that this is what would ultimately happen under these kinds of bills?

@_subject: "Disclosing" private email 
Arthur Chandler posted to the list:
It is probably a CYA move on the part of the University....if someone at SFSU is plotting the overthrow of our (or any other) government, engaging in espionage, child porn, etc. and using their Internet account, SFSU admin probably wants a way that they don't get held However, my view of this is that is sucks.
It would have to...otherwise how would they know if they needed to disclose it.
you before they do it.  While I don't have experience specifically with SFSU, it seems as though large organizations tend to do whatever they please. Probably anything that is involved in an active criminal Note that any thing in this message is just my opinion, and most assurdly could prove to be different when exposed to the real world!!
