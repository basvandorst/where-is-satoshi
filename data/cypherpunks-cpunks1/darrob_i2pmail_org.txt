@_subject: [tahoe-dev] switching from introducers to gossip? 
We've been using the multi-introducer patch on I2P since Tahoe-LAFS
1.8.3 and it has indeed proven to be more robust.  The single-introducer
grid we started out with simply fell apart when the introducer
disappeared.  It then took a long time before everybody learned the new
introducer's address and adjusted their configurations.  Time and files
were lost.  This hasn't happened again since we've started using the
patched version.
The administrative burden is definitely there.  However, I'd argue
against it being worse.  At least nodes that only know about a subset of
introducers (e.g. only I2 in your example below) are in no rush of
adding the rest (I3) because the grid is still functional.
We currently have 6 reliable introducers.  Before we got to that number
we had this exact situation.  Introducers were coming, going and
changing addresses.
We remedied this by writing grid-updates [1].  Using this tool users
have successfully updated their introducer lists many times without
having to think (much) about it.  (Unfortunately a restart is required
for Tahoe to pick up on new introducers in the list).
Obviously you're looking for a much more elegant and automatic solution
than some 3rd party utility, but I thought it's worth mentioning our
experiences with the existing system anyway.  It's not all that bad.
This sounds perfect.  I wonder if this system is susceptible to
introducer spam attacks of some sort, though.  I image those would be an
annoyance at best.
