Not a plain wordlist, but wordlist + thousands or millions of rules.
In fact, another tool implements that and achieves just slightly slower
speeds: That's correct.
Yes, Nate had pointed me at this one too.
OK, let's assume this.
For traditional DES-based crypt(3), it is 13 characters:
There's no fixed part, just two characters of salt and 11 of hash (using
a base-64 character set).
But let's continue to assume your format for the string for now:
Why not 16 times, if we use hex digits and assume a char-by-char strcmp()?
256 with the above correction.
Did you mean there will _likely_ (but not necessarily) be only one such
salt value?
Yes, well done.
I don't see how placement of the salt in the encoded salt+hash string
matters.  With either placement, the salt characters in the string will
always match because crypt(3) is called with that stored salt.  The fact
that with salt placement at the beginning strcmp() actually does compare
those characters before it gets to comparing H[0] doesn't affect
anything, as far as I can see, assuming a char-by-char strcmp().
Am I missing something?
