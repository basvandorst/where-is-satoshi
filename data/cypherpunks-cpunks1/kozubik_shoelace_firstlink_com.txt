Well, yes - or do you mean the implications for criminals?
First of all, a lot of that information is already available - we do use credit cards for virtually everything, and also, I doubt our spending habits will be readily available to anyone who asks...
Well, if I were an insurance company, and I could get this data, I too would make these decisions - it makes good business sense - insurance isn't your right you know...
That would suck, but really, how is everyone in the world going to get this information?
Hmmmm.....why exactly would one declare less than they made?  If you don't agree with the tax system, use your democratic voice to change it OR get out.

@_subject: Speaking of Redlining.... 
Please do not respond on the list, as this does not need to clog it up I am 19 years old, and I make 60,000 (verifiable income) per year.  I have a 2000 dollar down payment.
NOBODY will give me a loan.  Everyone tells me my credit is fine, and yet, I cannot get a car loan to save my life.
I have so far only tried major banks and GMAC finance.
If anyone has any information that could help me find a place in the denver area that would give me a car loan (or anywhere really - money can be wired from anywhere) PLEASE let me know.
I am trying to get a ~35,000 car loan - so far EVERYONE has just straight up told me I am too young (even though I make twice what these people make :) )

I am new to the list, and I was going to just sit and absorb for a few weeks, but....
Yes, the IQ scale that we generally refer to is based on age, ie. a 10 year old and a 5 year old that perform equally will have different IQ scores.
However, it is now generally accepted in the psychology field that your brain can degrade or improve over time based on the stresses placed upon it.  Basically what this means is that your brain is like a muscle, and the more you use it, the higher your IQ becomes.
Contrary to popular armchair psychology, there is no significant evidence that IQ and age are inversely related.  In general, however, the older we get, the less we use our brain, and it becomes like a muscle that we no longer use.
The point: Yes, you can improve your brain, and you can take proactive steps to increase your IQ.

@_subject: IQ and age 
agreed. well put.
I will, however, have to point out, that the IG test was not originally developed to measure the response of mentally defective patients to anything.
The first IQ test was developed to gauge the academic progress of school children.  That is why the scores are calculated according to age.
Yes, they were at a later date used for what you mentioned, and many other things at that.
I agree with everything else you said.
