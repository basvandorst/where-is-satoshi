@_subject: Unofficial Release 
I'm pleased to announce the release of an unofficial version of PGP v2.6ui
that allows for key generation up to 8176 bits, thanks are due to Tom
Rollins for his diligence compiling the code and also to Mathew at Mantis
Consultants in the UK for bringing us all up to 2.6ui. Said material, including source codes and an associated signature, can be found on ftp.netcom.com look in /pub/dcosenza for the following:                 pgp26ui.zip        --> DOS release
                pgp26uisrc.zip     --> source codes
                pgp26uisrc.sig     --> sigfile for pgp26uisrc.zip
                tom.asc            --> Tom's public key, you'll need this to
                                                  check the sig
This patch level is not endorsed or supported in any way shape or form by MIT, so usage of this program might put you in violation.
A couple of notes: keys that are larger than 1264 bits will not be readable
by previous versions of the software, so users who are interested in larger
key lengths are encouraged to move up. Also, considering the enormous amount
of time it takes to generate a 4096 bit key on a 486 (10 1/2 hours), an upper
limit of 2048 or thereabouts is strongly recommended.
Enjoy everybody and
Ever forward,

@_subject: WARNING! 
I spoke with Phil Zimmermann today at some length, and he has informed me that users who decide to use the jumo keys generated by the hack of 2.6ui will be running a risk of incompatibility on down the line with future releases he has planned. You have been warned!
Ever forward,

@_subject: FYI 
I spoke to Phil Zimmermann again today, and as per his request I have
removed the hack of 2.6ui from ftp given that PGP is Phil's intellectual
property and I respect him. In its place I have ftp'd Mathew's 2.6ui, I recommend it to all of you who want upward and downward compatibility
with official versions of the software.
Ever forward,
PS, I know that an 8176 bit key is absurd from a security standpoint,
for that matter so might a 4096 bit key, but there are users who feel they need such a capability and for their sake I sincerely hope that a future version of PGP addresses this concern at least up to 4096 bits. :-)
