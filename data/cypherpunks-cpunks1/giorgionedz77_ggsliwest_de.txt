@_subject: Build up your abdominal muscles in 1 week! 
one of my resolutions for 2009 was to stop ignoring the etsy shop and to not spin my wheels all day (these two problems are very related) i am the queen of walking in circles around the house and not really getting anything accomplished i wouldnt care except for that it drives me nuts part of the problem is my insomniatic nights which leave me only half there during the day times ( which then leads to high caffeine consumption) so i decided step one is to get good nights sleeps i am trying to change my night time routine to a peaceful herbal tea quiet inspiration seeking few hours it helps if i keep our room clean and the sheets freshly washed and calming reading more- tv less- at night is a goal then hopefully my days will be a little more with it because i hate wasting time
it was the first time i realized that things dont always go how you think they will and that it all can turn out better than you imagined
and then i found myself a mother funny i thought id teach awhile longer and have grant all to myself and save some money i was born in orange county where my parents had lived in the same house for like 20 years they had both lived in so cal all their lives from anthro
i love all the sweet artistically talented bloggers that offer free downloads around holidays for us readers but let me tell you thats not how it will really go i imagine most kids will want to stay home and play computer games but their moms will make them come and so theyll grudgingly put on a some church pants and skirts so i was wondering if you could help me know how to bring the romance back into our modern life its not really that important no matter the dress or the menu we just want the kids to come to feel the spirit of the temple but its like you said anne when you dont use your imagination to make life beautiful how much you miss
remember when the weather was warm and we would go to the park when daddy got home from work and we would bring homemade bread and fruit to eat for dinner and we would be drenched in golden light and the cousins would come meet us for some wild rides down the slide confession  i miss saved by the bell
me um we didnt have computers in our homes then
i went to the fabric store tonight in search of prints to make some new spring scarves with some will probably end up in the shop too i just love this look also i love toast (the catalog and the cooked bread)
he is the perfect mix to me of blues and folk and funk and feeling im just obsessed with him a little note for my valentine
ready to share the love
feeling so inspired
