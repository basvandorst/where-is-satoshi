I read the essay when it was published (a year or two ago?).  As I remember
it, it simply extrapolated the consequences of encryption and anonymity to
their logical conclusions.  Specifically, that social control could be
exerted through a "lottery" for "predicting" the dates of death for certain
unpopular politicians.  He stressed the untraceability, unaccountability,
and as far as possible, legality of everything proposed in his essay.
There was some debate concerning the essay which I did not follow.  So, I
don't know what concensus was finally reached.  But, his proposal seemed
generally workable to me.  I would definately not consider the essay to
be evidence of him being a "goddamn loon" anymore than Greg Broiles' post
being evidence of him being a goddamn idiot.  However, the majority of the
public who form their oppinions through newpaper headlines and the like certainly are.
Jim Bell's essay is, IMO, definately free speech.  And, as you can see from
the IRS Inspection report, he was not charged with anything relating to the
essay itself.  In fact, the raid happened a long time after he published
the essay, and may truely be unrelated.

I wouldn't bother with my nitpicky distinction below if it weren't for this
patronizing comment.
->   The application for a search warrant made it more than plain that
-> the main basis for the search and seizure fishing expedition mounted
-> by the Feds was based largely on his promotion of AP.
->   Only a few, sparse lines of the application are related to valid
-> IRS concerns re: taxes, etc. The search warrant was not made public on the cpunks list.  As you can see
form the above excerpt, I was commenting on the "IRS Inspection" report, which
was virtually the first description of Jim Bell's arrest, long before there
were even requests for information on the procedures for obtaining the
search warrants, etc...
After following the debate, I would definately agree that AP played an
important part in sparking the paranoia of the govt. officials to arrest
Jim, which in turn sparked off paranoia on the list, and rather reactionary
comments towards AP, and reactionary flames towards the reactionaries.  :)
Hopefully this trend won't continue.

Time flies fast on the Internet; or haven't you noticed?  Three days of rather

I saw no mention anywhere on the list of those documents being available,
only that you were considering making them available.
By the way, at the time I wrote my quoted response, you yourself had as

My message followed three hours later.  I see it was directed against your

along with your determination.  It seems like you're taking this a little

All he said was that he had them.  No details.
And all this is so nitpicky that I can't believe I even bothered originally
replying to you, merely because of the patronizing tone of your message.
I must have been having a bad day.  Today is worse, though, witness the
present message.
The rest of your post is at least intelligently worded, however, so I'm glad I
persevered through it.

His original posting was ill considered, I agree.  He did consider it much
more in the following years, you must concede.  Bell did not, afterall,
propose that we fight a land war in China.  This scheme relies mostly
on encryption and anonymity, which takes care of the tactical part.
His political agenda is at least self consistant.
- -> morally indefensible, and What a cro-magnon sentiment, and coming from such a bright lad.  :)
(Sorry, my turn to be patronizing :)
Morality is logically indefensible.  If it weren't for your earlier

on a philosophy/ethics rant.

I've got to hand it to you there.  No where does he claim to be a lawyer.
However, he does give the impression of knowing the law.

Duly noted.

- -> But
- -> the "marketplace of ideas" model, whereby good speech is expected to negate

- -> ought to be) legal to say it, but it's also a non-useful idea, which I hope

Ah, an advocate of the survival of the fittest idea, and a utilitarian to boot.
Well, may your memes flourish.  However, to be consistent, you must admit
that the fittest and more "useful" ideas may have nothing to do with your
defenses of particular politics, morals, or laws.  In fact, they have as
much, or more, to with the environment that they are in as their content.
Thus, there is no "bad speech" or "good speech".  Certain ideas simply "win"
in certain circumstances.  Had the circumstances been slightly different,
different ideas would have "won".

I'm following you.
- -> I think
- -> that the search of Jim's house, and its relationship to his free speech

- -> because I think that isn't uncommon where the target is a "dissident", of one
- -> flavor or another; and I think that dissidents don't/shouldn't lose their
- -> civil rights as a consequence of their status. ("when they came for .."
- -> argument incorporated herein by reference.)
I definately and wholeheartedly agree with your sentiments here.
- -> (The search is also interesting for reasons unrelated to Jim and his ideas,
- -> because it provides insight into the level and type and timing of law
- -> enforcement access to the net, treatment of a "confidential informant", and
- -> protocol/procedure for search & seizure of computers and potentially

- -> But that doesn't mean that the dissidents get special respect or treatment
- -> for poor thinking. I think AP is poorly reasoned and poorly researched. (And
- -> I think that "dissident" + "poor analysis/research" + "obsessive focus" =
- -> "loon", hence my original comments.)
I disagree with your acusation concerning "poor analysis/research".  Thus
I can not agree with even your definition of "loon".  Besides, there are
other possible, sometimes contradictory, variables fitting in to this oversimplistic equation that would also = "loon".  For example, "sheep" + "religion" + "obsessive focus" = "loon"
"freethinker" + "athiest" + "obsessive focus" = "loon"
"cypherpunk" + "statist" + "obsessive focus" = "loon"
Then there's:
"obsessive focus" = "loon"
which brings up another view, namely:
"obsessive focus" = "dedication"
As far as "poor analysis/research" in and of itself goes: there have been
plenty of groundbreaking works which had very poor analysis, but were
invaluable in "showing the way".  Many of their authors were very dedicated.
And some were even, !gasp!, "dissident".  At the very least, dedication has often led to the publicization of ideas which are thereafter better
researched by others (we can call them "drones", "librarians", "technicians",
or even "computers").
In any case, I've long gone past the point of rambling... and long past
the general topicality of cypherpunks, so I'll shut up.
Now...  Goodnight.  :)
And, don't take this post too seriously as it is 3:41 AM here, and I'm
past the point of starting to nod off...........

@_subject: Technology and loss of freedom 
-> Technology has also done precious little for advancing human
-> freedoms (although cryptography may be an exception).
I would disagree.  Technology has done an incredible ammount for advancing
human freedom.
Communication is a prime example.  The printing press has resulted in widespread education, which is a great facilitator of freedom when its not
a purely socializing force.  It has also facilitated insurrections and revolutions (the Revolutionary War here in the States is a good example).
This, though not always leading to 'democracy', is a self determining act,
and thus a free one.
Technology has also made travel easier.  This, combined with communication
has led, and is leading, to greater cosmopolitanism.  The result of this
cosmopolitanism is the loosening of the bonds of tradition and taboo in
any particular culture.  It also promotes greater understanding and peace,
perhaps following an initial isolationist reaction.
Science, the mother of technology, has led to freedom from stifling
religious dogma (perhaps substituting some of it's own dogma, of course).
Medical technological advancement has resulted in a longer life span,
which increases the opportunities alloted to man within his lifetime.
This also translates to an increase in freedom of action.
Whether people use this freedom or not, is a seperate issue.
I am also not unaware of the detractions of technology, and how it has
been used to curtail freedom.  It has many other detractions as well.
In fact, I am of the oppinion that we have indeed paid too dear a price for such rapidity of technological advancement.  The fire that has been stolen from the gods is burning our house down.

@_subject: NYU's PGP Key-Signing Seminar - a critique 
I am writing regarding the PGP Seminar to be held on the 27th of March.
Your informative session is laudible.  And, I would like to take full
advantage of the key-signing session to follow.  However, there is a
certain concern which it would be prudent to address first.
 provides instructions
for the session, which state:
   "8. At the seminar Tim and Ilya will confirm the identity of all
       participants and the participants will identify their own keys.
    9. After the seminar Ilya will e-mail all the participants the
       keyring with all the keys, along with the instructions on how
       to sign them."
This conflicts with the guidelines for hosting pgp key signing sessions
as presented in the alt.security.pgp FAQ (a relevant excerpt is attached to this message).  The FAQ states:
   "6.  Each person securely obtains their own fingerprint, and after
       being vouched for, they then read out their fingerprint out
       loud so everyone can verify it on the printout they have."
               ~~~~~~~~
The concern I have is that this discrepancy undermines the web of trust
model for PGP.  The participants of the NYU session will not have the
opportunity for verifying the identity of the owners of the keys that
they are signing.  They must rely on a central authority ("Tim and Ilya").
I realize that this may be a simpler, and perhaps a more convenient method
of conducting a key-signing session, perhaps ideally suited to a session
aimed at novices.  However, I feel that the security provided by PGP is
thereby undermined.  We must not forget that security is the whole reason that even the novices at your session are using PGP for in the first place.
I hope this issue can be addressed before the session begins.

 ............................................................................
   6.8.  How do I organize a key signing party?
   Though the idea is simple, actually doing it is a bit complex,
   because you don't want to compromise other people's private keys or
   spread viruses (which is a risk whenever floppies are swapped
   willy-nilly).  Usually, these parties involve meeting everyone at
   the party, verifying their identity and getting key fingerprints
   from them, and signing their key at home.
   Derek Atkins  has recommended this method:      _________________________________________________________________
   There are many ways to hold a key-signing session.  Many viable
   suggestions have been given.  And, just to add more signal to this
   newsgroup, I will suggest another one which seems to work very well
   and also solves the N-squared problem of distributing and signing
   keys.  Here is the process:
    1.  You announce the keysinging session, and ask everyone who
       plans to come to send you (or some single person who *will* be
       there) their public key.  The RSVP also allows for a count of
       the number of people for step 3.
    2.  You compile the public keys into a single keyring, run "pgp
       -kvc" on that keyring, and save the output to a file.
    3.  Print out N copies of the "pgp -kvc" file onto hardcopy, and
       bring this and the keyring on media to the meeting.
    4.  At the meeting, distribute the printouts, and provide a site
       to retreive the keyring (an ftp site works, or you can make
       floppy copies, or whatever -- it doesn't matter).
    5.  When you are all in the room, each person stands up, and
       people vouch for this person (e.g., "Yes, this really is Derek
       Atkins -- I went to school with him for 6 years, and lived with
       him for 2").
    6.  Each person securely obtains their own fingerprint, and after
       being vouched for, they then read out their fingerprint out
       loud so everyone can verify it on the printout they have.
    7.  After everyone finishes this protocol, they can go home,
       obtain the keyring, run "pgp -kvc" on it themselves, and
       re-verify the bits, and sign the keys at their own leisure.
    8.  To save load on the keyservers, you can optionally send all
       signatures to the original person, who can coalate them again
       into a single keyring and propagate that single keyring to the
       keyservers and to each individual.
   This seems to work well -- it worked well at the IETF meeting last
   month in Toronto, and I plan to try it at future dates.

                      Pretty Good Privacy Seminar
                 Thursday, March 27 at 12:00 pm Warren
                         Weaver Hall, Room 313
   [INLINE] This is a Blue-Ribbon event, CANYU will distribute Blue
   Ribbons to participants
   This seminar sponsored by the Computer Advocacy @ NYU and the
   Academic Computing Facility.  The seminar will explore the need for
   use of cryptography for communications in every day life, and
   demonstrate how PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) can be used at NYU.
   This workshop is a part was preceded by another seminar titled
   "Encryption:  Padlocks for the digital age".
   Speakers:  * Tim O'Connor * Ilya Slavin
   A key signing session will follow the seminar.  The instructions
   follow:      1.  If you have already created your key, skip to the
    following step.  + You can create your new key on one of the IS
    machines (and, most likely, many other computers at NYU) by
    following the steps outlined in the following document.      2.  Once your key is generated and signed by yourself, extract
    your public key from the key ring by typing pgp -kxat userid
    keyfile.asc where keyfile.asc is a name of the file you want to
    copy your key to.     3.  Send this file with your name and a mention of the seminar to
    slavin at acf2.nyu.edu before 7:00 PM on March 26, 1997.      4.  Ilya will compile a master keyring with all the keys before
    the seminar starts.     5.  Please write down (or print out) the output of the following
    command:  pgp -kvc where  is your name or e-mail address
    that appears in your key.     6.  Ilya will have printouts of userids and fingerprints of all
    keys sent to him.     7.  Bring two photo IDs (either a passport or other respectable
    form of ID) to the seminar so that we can verify your identity.     8.  At the seminar Tim and Ilya will confirm the identity of all
    participants and the participants will identify their own keys.     9.  After the seminar Ilya will e-mail all the participants the
    keyring with all the keys, along with the instructions on how to
    sign them.     10.  Once the keys are signed, the participants will e-mail their
    signed keyrings to Ilya, who will add their signatures to the
    master keyring.  11.  As soon as Ilya receives all the signed
    keys, he will e-mail the complete keyring to all the participants,
    who can add the new signatures to their own keyrings.

-> -> 	Dear Sergey,
-> -> 	You are, of course, correct about this -- I knew I missed

Thank you for replying so promptly to my query.  I am grateful for your
sensitivity to the issues involved.

@_subject: Remailer problem solution? 
-> -> >Why would not one of these solutions work?
-> >
-> >1. Accept and send PGP encrypted messages only.
-> -> This "works" in that it reduces the number of people subjected to messages
-> they don't want to see, but it also makes it more difficult (or impossible)
-> to use remailers for tasks like:
-> -> sending info to crypto-illiterate reporters/politicians/whatever
-> ("whistleblowing")
-> sending messages to newsgroups and mailing lists which don't have a shared
-> private key
This is only a practical problem related to PGP's lack of popularity.
The proposed solution will work in the long run, assuming PGP achieves
great popularity.  Thus, education of the public concerning PGP and remailers
will help make this solution more effective.
Of course, interim short term solutions should be sought as well.
-> >2. Keep a list of addresses of people who do not wish to receive mail
-> >from the remailers.
-> -> This is done already, but the group of people who don't want to recieve mail
-> from remailers but haven't signed up yet (because they don't know about
-> remailers) is orders of magnitude bigger than people who've signed up. Mostly
-> people get on the block list(s) because they've already been mailed things
-> they didn't want to see; by the time they learn about blocking, it's too
-> late.
Information explaining blocking could be sent with each piece of mail from
a remailer.  Alternatively, to conserve bandwidth, a pointer to a web-page
could be attached.
-> Also, it's difficult to apply this solution to many remailers - should all
-> remailers block an address because one remailer operator claims to have
-> received a request? Or should each operator act alone, which means that one
-> anonymity-hostile end user must send multiple block requests?
A web page could be dedicated to propagating multiple block requests, in
the manner of those extant sites which propogate new web-page information to search engines.  This could also be made easy, intuitive, and mostly transparent to the end user.

PGP's current lack of popularity does not prevent spammers from using

Exactly!  A 400,000 address spam will take a non-trivial ammount of time
to prepare (46 days, assuming 10secs/message) if every message must be
encrypted with an individual's key.

@_subject: remailer spam throttle 
-> I just came up with another idea which definitely has some holes in it,
-> but perhaps someone wants to improve on it.
-> -> There's a big distributed database of pgp keys on the several keyservers.
-> Add a bit to the database specifying whether the key owner wants to receive
-> anonymous e-mail.  By default set it to true for the existing addresses.
-> -> When the final remailer in the chain wants to send someone an anonymous
-> message, it attempts to retrieve a key from the keyservers.
-> -> If it fails to find a key, it junks the mail (you don't want to keep it
-> around, it's baiting the LEAs!) and instead sends a notification to the
-> recipient that some anon e-mail was addressed to it, but it was junked;
-> and if they want to receive anon e-mail, they need to give a pgp key
-> to one of the key servers this remailer uses.
-> -> If it finds a key, it looks at the anon mail bit; if it's on, it encrypts -> the e-mail with the recipient's key and sends it; otherwise it junks it.
-> -> Obviously, the key servers would need to be modified to allow users to
-> specify whether they want anon e-mail when then store their keys, and
-> to change this setting any time.
-> -> Right now, there's a very large number of addresses in the key servers.
-> Instantly making them into a list of addresses that accept anon mail
-> will make it hard (hopefully infeasible) for the LEAs to investigate
-> everyone willing to accept anon e-mail as a suspect in sending it.
Unfortunately, key servers can not be trusted.  I'm sure you're aware that
anyone can submit a key, and thus forgeries abound.
If the above model is adopted, key servers will be the first target of
the prospective spammer.

-> -> Why Sergey, you mean to tell me that there are key servers out there that
-> accept a key from a purported address and don't send back a cookie to that
-> address to see if it's not fake? :-) That's just terrible. Definitely no
-> key coming from such a server should be trusted. :-) :-)
-> -> Today is March 29, 1997 - almost April 1st. The Internet ain't what is
-> used to was 15 or 10 or even 2 years ago. If you get an e-mail that
-> purports to be from X, and it requests that you add X's public key
-> to your key server, or (un)subscribe X to a mailing list, or
-> block X from receiving anonymous e-mail - it may be a forgery.
-> Never act on such requests without trying to authenticate them
-> with a cookie.
DNS maps can easily be forged.  Key servers run on machines with questionable physical and operating system security.  Finally, key server ops themselves
can mess with keys.
This is why people who use keys off of keyservers are encouraged to verify
the key via it's key fingerprint, or at via the web of trust.
However, this can not be done via automation on a large scale for the purpose
of address blocking, unless via a certification authority.
The bottom line is that keyservers can not be trusted, despite any primitive
security measures they supposedly have in place.
