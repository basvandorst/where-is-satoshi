I recall a case several years ago where a woman (somewhere on the East
Coast?) was thrown in jail for contempt.  She refused several times to
tell the court where her child was in an attempt to keep her ex-husband
from gaining custody (I believe he was accused of sexually abusing the
child).  The woman had been in jail for several months when a higher court
ruled that she must be released.  I don't have any references to this case,
perhaps someone else does.

@_subject: Where to get Big Bro Stickers 
The same thing happened to me.  I sent him $10 and never got any stickers.
I mailed him once and he said he sent them, but would try sending some
more.  I've never gotten them, or bothered to mail Chris again.

@_subject: RC4 article in Saturday (Sept 17) New York Times 
Actually, yes they have.  Markoff talked about them in the last paragrpah of his RC4 story in the Saturday NYT.  I think that's the first mention of remailers that I've seen in major media, but I could be wrong.
