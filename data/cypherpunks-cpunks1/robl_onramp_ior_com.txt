IMHO, I see nothing wrong with predatory behavior.. then again, I hunt in
the fall, so it must be a redneck thing..
MS and any of the other software companies are competing for domination in a
narrow field.. MS just happens to be the only real choice for OS anymore..
well, for a standard, out of the box OS anyways. The fact that they have to
leave in undisclosed hooks to get their own software to excell over others
just points to the poor software they produce overall. I have to admit that I like, possibly admire, the way the Bill and crew have
captured the market.. from a marketing standpoint, they did a first rate job
of running with the ball until there was no pursuit.. Sure, from time to
time, someone tries to throw a blocker in thier path, but they just overrun
it and keep going.. Forget about the monopoly aspects for a second and look
at MS as an American success story. It has all the classic elements: started
small, with a crew of social misfits and eventually grew up.
Just a few cents worth..

Big difference is that your neighbors were usually looking out for you..
not waiting to catch you doing something wrong..
Even in the small town I live in, there is considerable privacy even though everyone knows everyone else.. people tend to keep their noses out of others business.. of course, if you offer to talk, then its fair game for the side of the road interrogations Rob L.

Hell, to be honest, I don't even fathom 1/2 of what is said around here.. but I understand the need to encrypt, have trained myself to use PGP, and am polically active.. I mainly use the list for a who's who of crypto and a referance guide to whats going on in the field.. Trust me on this one.. I was the newbie a couple of months ago and stepped into it pretty big for my first time out.. Afterwards (of course)
I read the Faq's, and have lurked a lot since.. take this list slow, as it will eventually pay out in the info you are looking for..

Actually, it is not jeapordy that they get from doing so, but some of the best bug finders and security experts on the planet.. for close to free.
If hackers can find 10 bugs before final release, it means there is a good chance that they will fix those bugs before final release.
Think of it this way.. you practice a new task until you are competent at it.. beta code is the same.. it is the practice or scratch code that may be refined into the final product.

@_subject: cryptography eliminates lawyers? 
I certainly expect the world of business to change and reflect the use of crytographic tech as soon as it becomes an acceptable practice to use it.
This may take awhile as the media and current administration continue to paint black anyone who wants to use such tech for any reason.
Should there come a time, however, when crypto is a fashionable and accepted thing, I would expect to see law offices offering to send and recieve documents using such tech, as well as generating and maintaining
keys off-site for clients. With such a legal hoopla being made over crypto, I can not fathom lawyers not getting in on the action.. While the need for lawyers may decline with the increased use of crypto, I do not think they are about to become an endangered species. Those that are smart will find a way to profit from it, while those that can not adapt will be left behind (and who says lawyers are not part of evolution

@_subject: cryptography eliminates lawyers? 
I know from my employers perspective, that lawyers are retained for more than just litigation. Often they handle the exchange of critical documents and transactions that need to be kept confidential.
The impact of crypto as I see it is a reduction in the use of legal services of this nature, not in litigation. Using a lawyer to pass on tech specs on a new product to the patent office is a common occurance, as it is assumed that the lawyer can maintain the secrecy required for handling these documents. Should the patent office offer a key, you could just as easily send an encrypted message in place of a lawyer handling this.
There are bound to be other options and opportunities as well for lawyers to use crypto.. securing a companies documents or whatever.

[...]
Being a freedom loving, gun owner, with an interest in maintaining both my rights to guns, and my right to cryto, I am saddened to see that you have to retreat at all.
As far as I am concerned, if I am in my house, and someone uninvited is in there also (burglar/thief/psycho/whatever) then I have already sufficiently retreated.. and they will likely be shot. Anyone invading my home is considered a threat to my wife, children and myself.
I had heard that in the state of Texas, intruders/trespassers are at their own risk after sundown, as it is legal to fire upon them at that point, regardless of thier intent.. I have not been able to confirm this, as of yet.. but am looking for the answer in my meager spare time.

-would you expect anything less from us? Beyond having the willies.. This is more than just scary, it feels like
rape when you think about it for awhile. Everything you buy, on credit, is
recorded and sold to someone who wants to know your secrets. Everytime you make a banking transaction, someone is watching and compiling the data. Is there any legal recourse to get your name removed from the sellable list?
Or is it too late and we can not save even the vestiges of our privacy?
Oh, but if only I had the 'hacker' skill to break into such a database..

Sorry if my choice of words offended you.. the intent was to express the feeling of being violated without consent. Perhaps I should have used the term violated or some other less violent term.
The point being, I did not give permission for my records to be distributed, nor did I see a disclaimer on my credit cards that states that the transactions I make will be sold off to mailing houses in order to target me for additional sales.

At least you notified me.. :) Something the TRW crew or others like them do not do.
This is true.. I could adopt a nym, such as I use on my BBS, or when I am doing other stuff on the net.. but it is difficult at best to get a new set of credit cards, ID and so on with a new name/alias and still maintain your own name. If it were possible to have an alias in real life, as easy as it is to get one on the 'net that is, then I would most certainly do so..

If I were single, it would be a lot easier to just start making up names and living under assumed aliases.. but with a wife and two kids, I have to follow the rules a bit more.. My privacy is worth variable amounts depending on who has access to it.. I certainly do not care if anyone on this list knows who I am or not, as it is something I voluntarily chose to join. Selling info about me, without notifying me before hand is another situation altogether. Even the magazines I subscribe to have notices that my name may be sold.. and the mags that don't have such a warning, but sell my name anyways, get cancelled as soon as I discover it. Far easier to stop by the local PC store and buy it a week later than to have mounds of junk mail piling up.
Again, you both are correct, and perhaps I was overstating my position in regards to the TRW/etc. groups.. I have a tendancy to do so. Each of us has the responsibility to monitor the activities in our lives, both directly and indirectly. Whether this is watching our spending to make sure we do no overcharge, or encrypting mail to keep in secure, we need to be aware of what we are doing, and the reactions of others as a result of our actions. In this case, the action is spending money on credit, and the reaction is being monitored by credit agencies. My solution was to get rid of all the credit cards 4 years ago.. my credit history is trashed in part do to very low activity over the last 4 years, and of course, the side effect of maxing out 4 cards.

Nor do I support additional rules/laws or regulations.. but if there are existing ones to screw with, use 'em..
Recently I had a bill turned over to collections from, of all places, the daycare we used to take our kids too.. we owe them about $1300 in their estimation. The reason we have not paid is due to 11 days of lost work due to head lice that they provided to my kids, plus they stopped serving breakfast which was in the contract we signed when enrolling the kids there..
I was notified by the collection co. about this submittal (now $1500 for some reason..) and by law, I can dispute this in writing, thus slowing the wheels of the collection monster horribly. I did so.. and for the last 4 months, they have been trying to prove I owe money.. I was asking if such a system exist for the release of your credit info.. and it appears that there is no safety mechanism in that monster.  Rather than cry out for more laws to be twisted against us later, I agree that letting it happen, and using cash instead of credit, is the smart answer Someone care to point me at e-cash info? sounds interesting.. remember, I am new to the crypto scene and still think PGP is neato ;)

I am one as well.. being pro-2nd amendment, and pro-1st.. and learning lots about the fight to protect them. Unlike some of the non-US readers in this list, I can see the clear connection between the 1st and 2nd amendment attacks.. if one falls, the other does as well. Both are slowly being whittled away to nothing (i.e. you can have only certain 'assault-style' guns, and you can only be guaranteed certain types of free speech)
