And Lyle_Seaman at transarc.com replies:
I think that Victor's friend proposes a second function, f(), which is
not the same as DES.  He is saying that for every set of three keys
used for triple-DES (k2,k3,k4), there is a key (k1) such that:
        f(k1,text) = DES(k2,DES(k3, DES(k4,text)))
It seems to me this is different than saying DES is a group, since f != DES.
Am I mistaken?
