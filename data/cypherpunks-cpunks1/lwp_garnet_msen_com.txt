@_subject: Vinge on PKE ? 
Apologies if I repeat a question which has already been answered.
My only gateway onto the Net is very expensive, and I miss many
important postings.  Some time ago it was asked why Vernor Vinge
made passing reference to humans' naivete in trusting public key
encryption, and some posters were seeking to contact professor
Vinge for clarification.  Has any further explanation been discovered for his distrust of PKE?

Yes, and even in the here and now, we suspect the existence of Powers with computational resources far in excess of our own.  But do we know for sure that PKE *must* rely on computational obfuscation?  Is it demonstrable that access to a public key always yields the secret key, given sufficient computational power?  Or is this only a result of the clumsy way we construct our keypairs here in the slow zone?

I knew that old compuserve account was good for something.
