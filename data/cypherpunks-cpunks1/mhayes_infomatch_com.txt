The Jacobin (sp) sat on the left side while the other guys
(I forget their names) sat on the right.  Of course both used to
be on the left before they klled everyone on the right after
which an expansion of sorts happened to fill the seats.  I think the event was called the night of the long knives?
I would have thought main stream would have been in the middle.

Are you saying that you are anti-corporation?  That would make
no sense.  Many corporations are very benificial to society.  Take
Shell for example.  It did all that it could to save the life of
that guy in Nigeria, but the "libertarians" who instantly boycotted
Shell would have you belive that they encouraged the sentence.
What is becoming a major export?  Weak laws?  Why would a country encourage criminals to come to it's boarders?
I don't think you have analysed the situation.  It was the regulating
that deystroyed the UK cattel industry and put the entire world at
risk.  The British government protected the beef industry despite a
ban on British beef accross Europe.  If Eroupe is considered to be the
"Free Market" as you suggest, then it would be exactly opposite to what
you have suggested.  The "Free Market" labled the animals coming from
Britian to be of questionable quality.  The regualtors in Britian disaggreed because it would cost them a few penny's to slauter the infected heards.  Then Britians started getting sick.  The rest of the
world throws up bans of British beef; Yet the British regulators still
do not cleanse the heards.  The only way to ensure the desease is gone
is to kill every last cow in Britian and bring in fresh stock.  THAT
MEANS NO GIVING THEM TO INDIA YOU STUPID FUCKS.

This is another interesting point.  Why is it better for a company to
agree to any regulation?  Do you REALLY trust Microsoft?  I do not.
They write poor code.  They probably signed the aggreement because they
knew that there product was so bad that it couldn't violate any restrictions or they contracted the work out to the NSA who wrote the
code for them and so they know that it can be cracked if they need to track down every last copy of the OS for their marketing group to do a
statistical analysis on.
I belive that this is the GOVERNMENT body called the BBC.  We have a similary group up here called the Communist Broadcast Corporation.
Actually, I must be fair to them,  I do like Air Farce.  I don't think
your argument holds any water.  Different cultures have different social
norms.  I was quite shocked to see John Clease stark f**king naked on a
tea commercial (isn't tea a carrier of caffine? yes. Does caffine change
the way in which you body works? yes.  Is caffine food? no; therefore caffine is a drug and tea carries that drug.) So?  All this proves is that the US is more oreiented toward the free market than other places.  In the free market, on's "brand value" is incredibly important.  I think you are also missing the distinction
between a company and it's marketing.  I'm sure Hoover, as in your
example, has many marketing camnpaines going on at any time and that
every so often an overeager director of the comapany that Hoover hired
to do the campain makes a mistake.  I'm sure this happens all the time,
just take a look at another marketing company: Microsoft.
Does that mean a libertarian is more Free Market oriented or more
Command Market oriented?  I'm not sure there is any correlation at
all.  I belive in anti trust laws, does that mean I can object to mhayes at infomatch.com

The military's sole purpose is to destroy things and kill people.
Freedom is protected by the poeple for the people some of which

most circumstances.  How many gun battles erupt at speed traps?  Granted,
there are instances where some force is required in arresting violent individuals, but it is still illeagal for the police to use ecessive
You are wrong about bad laws being enforced.  Many laws are not enforeced
by the police.  Have you never been "let off" or "givin a warning" by the
police?  How many times have you seen people j walk in front of the police
who did nothing?
Computers are not nessasary to encode data, they just make it a lot

@_subject: Fwd: Re: wealth and property rights 
Hmmm, only a few years ago the Finacial Post did a report on welfare in
Ontario.  The maximum benifit package (for two adults, two children or
something like that) came to about 34 000 dollars.  YES 34 000 dollars.
Actually, the figure the Post published was wrong.  Welfare Ontario said
they were a couple of hundred dollars UNDER the true value.
Of course that isn't all in cash.  It comes as subsidies houseing, free diapers,
free baby food......  Are you telling me that it would be hard to live on 34 grand?  I wasn't aware
that our dollar was so weak....
And then there is the B.C./Alberta fiasco.  The final check welfare recipients
get in Alberta just happens to be the exact amount it costs to buy a bus ticket to B.C.
The B.C. govn't gave up ALL federal funding of their welfare program to
impose a rule that required 3 months of residence before benifits would
be given.  I don't even want to start talking about the newfys.
What it comes down to is this.  Eventually we as a society will have to
make a choice.  We will have to chose between hurting the people who
work and hurting the people who don't work.  You can't have it both ways.
IF  you MUST make the choice, who will you choose?

Yes, there are maany angry young men in this country.  Unions prevent
young men from compeating in the market place.  Unemployment Insurance artificialy increases the unemployment rate by 2% (this is a figure that
many people more knowledgable than me have stated)  welfare increases
the unemployment rate by another 1%.  The Canadian Pension Plan is
out of money and yet I am still forced to contribute and for what???
Will it still exist when I retire?  Not bloody likely.
Fortunatly NAFTA has forced some of our companies to compeat or
die.  Take a look at Canadian.  Are they gone?  I didn't get to watch the
news today......
I'll bet that most of the employees would gladly take a 10% wage cut
to save to company but the union leaders won't let them vote on it.  Why?
Because they would loose power.  Look at what the govn't do.  Most of
them just contribute to the problem by offering hand outs.  They don't
need hand outs!  ONE gov't (Alberta) offered to lower the fuel taxes.
YAAAAA RALPH!!!  (Who's ecinomic reforms incidentally (sp)  was hearalded by the Post as a model for govn't across North America)
Cut taxes and kill the union leaders.
Sorry for siting my sources.....

@_subject: I'm Confused about Algorithm Patents in Canada 
Patents are different from copywrites.  In Canada there are specific
guidelines pertaining to what can and cannot be patented.  These guide
lines are avalible from the government (look in the blue pages).
Algorithims, circut designs, etc, etc (what about papers about them?)
are specifically excluded from copywrite laws in all countries that adhere to the international copywrite treaty (or what ever).
Algorithms come under intelectual property protection but I have no
idea what laws govern that.  I do recall that sevral years ago, a company sued an emplyee that was leaving.  The court ordered that he
could not obtain employment in his previous field for seven years
(practically a life time).
If in doubt you should probably seek professional legal advice because
you could get yourself into MAJOR legal trouble.
