@_subject: rehash of fbi v. weaver, or 'freeh is a jerk' 
It was announced (I think last week) that there would be no prosecution
of the sniper who shot Vicki Weaver as she stood in the cabin door
holding her baby.
It's good to see an editorial like that in a major newspaper.

According to today's WSJ it's the name used by hackers who broke into
Pipeline Services, an Internet access provider in NY.  Their intrusion
was detected and stopped before major damage was done. They posted
a message that "warned corporate America against commercializing
the Internet into a 'cesspool of greed'."

Yes, but  the account form will have a place for it anyway and the account
opening person will demand it.  My experience a few years ago was that
I had to go to an officer and point out that the account was not interest bearing and so the SS# was not required in order to get the account
opened without it.

@_subject: procmail: another question 
Please excuse my ignorance, but will procmail run under DOS?  Will it
download mail from a PopMail server?
