The leaked release of the European Commission's working papers on the
future of Top Level Domains highlights the impending collision between
adherents of the present "multistakeholder" ICANN governance model,
and an ever longer list of national governments who challenge that
At the core of the controversy is the question of how ICANN can claim
legitimacy in the DNS world when none of its Directors or Officers are
elected. Even worse, its only answer, when challenged legally, is that
it is responsive to its contract with an agency of the U.S.
Government, which agency claims authority from the elected Congress of
the United States through the agency's organic act, which nowhere
mentions the Internet, ICANN, or the Domain Name System
