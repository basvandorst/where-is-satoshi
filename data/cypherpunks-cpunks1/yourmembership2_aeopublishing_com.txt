links to other pages. But, someone told me I should still
put a 'click here' underneath all the pictures. How can
I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other
pages without coming right out and saying so? < - -
Hi -
You just need to use alt tags for your link pictures - when a
mouse is moved over the pics, the alt tags saying 'Click here
for.....' will come up and everyone will know they are links.

Every day of the week, I get questions from people all   over the world, including my No BS GIMG Members,   wanting to know some of the most valuable "secrets"  to my on-going internet success.
Let me say, above all else, I don't believe there are any  *true* "secrets" to success on the Net. What you do to  become successful in the online world is not a "secret",  in my opinion. Most successful people follow simple, clear,  repeatedly-proven strategies to succeed, whether on the  Net or off.
But, when it comes to someone asking for advice,  consultation, or simply asking, "What's your secret?",  I have to blush & say ...
Persistence and personality.
Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little  disclaimer: What makes ME successful may not work the  same for YOU ... & your first lesson is to get over  the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in   my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret.
Clearly, it is not. It's not unknown. It's not unattainable.  It's not years of digging to find the "secrets" to internet riches.
One thing that "gets to me" so often in my work as an  Internet Consultant, author and Internet Success  Strategist is that so many people on the Net seem to  have this incredibly huge mental block that stands  between themselves and success on the Net. It's  almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims  of what works and what doesn't work, and so many  LONG, complicated routes to actually succeeding in  their online venture, that "success" is the  equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall.
It's NOT that difficult, my friends! It is NOT that complicated!!
Long-time friend and business associate Rick Beneteau  has a new eBook out called Branding YOU & Breaking the Bank. Get it!!   .  But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks  so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your  online venture a success. And, yes, Rick & I come from the same school of  "self marketing" - marketing YOU! Obviously, that's  the core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn't  agree with him more.
Point being, *you* ARE everything you do online to  succeed. You ARE your web site, your business, your  marketing piece, your customer service, your customers'  experiences with your business -- ALL of it, is YOU!  Read his ebook & you'll see more of what I'm saying.
The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have  standing high as you can see, blocking the path  between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is  not real OK? It doesn't exist. There's nothing there  to fear to begin with ... get over it!!
What I'm telling you is, the only thing standing between  you and the success you most desire ... is yourself.  When you realize this, you will tear down that brick  wall by means of complete and instantaneous  disintegration. It will no longer exist *in your mind*,  which is the only "real" place it ever was anyhow!
Yes, "persistence and personality" inherently includes  honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other  qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate  goals and realize that probably the most valuable,   powerful key to your success ... is YOU!
That may be the most incredible "secret" we ever  uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall  won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it.
Talk about SIMPLE!!

website features handcrafted products from the wonderful land
of Rajasthan and the range and quality of products are not only
unique but also very attractive.
The problem is that I have been submitting to search engines and
FFA, and I average about 15 to 20 hits per day, but this is not
translating into business. What I need is targeted email addresses
of the wholesalers, importers and those who are interested in such
Further since I am based in India where remittance of US Dollars
are restricted and controlled, it becomes very difficult to rent or
buy targeted email lists or directories of relevant importers.I have
great faith in the products we carry and am sure that proper
exposure to the right audience will result in huge sales and
business, but this problem has tied me down. Even though I
am marketing incredible products, but in absence of right targeting,
it is little use.
Can you suggest how to go about it?
Looking forward to your positive reply. Thanks!

--> I keep getting an error 403 & 404 on internet explorer,
and I can't get in my hotmail account, and it says
that on napster to. Can someone help me? <--
Error messages can happen for lots of reasons, including
that you may be connecting too slowly to the web server
you are trying to reach. Or, the problem could be with your
computer hardware limitations or the version of explorer
you are using.
You would also need to mention if the problem just
started, if you've made any changes to your settings, or
if this is an ongoing problem.  Give some more details and
I might be able to be more specific.
