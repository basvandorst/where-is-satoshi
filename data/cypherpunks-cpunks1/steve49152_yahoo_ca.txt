Just like the good ol' USA, AFAIK.  It's just that the inequities at home
aren't limited to those that are a product of the petrochemical industry. All of which is not too different from what I see in the poorer parts of
the city I live in: Toronto.
Lately people were talking about PSE/COA topics which make moot much of
the bickering and squabbling that is a constant feature of capitalism.  We
don't hear much about PSE these days for some reason.  I suspect that the
path from here to there is still too far beyond the planning horizon of
too many people.  So, if PSE in a recognizeable form represents a rational
outcome of current economic progress, then I guess we must wait until it
looms nearer before selling it to the world.

probably enough people around who like domination games that the

Give them more money.  Aridrop directv dishes, televisions, and old
computers.  Hell, I don't know.  Winning arab hearts and minds is a topic
that is entirely beyond my area of expertise.
And then what?  What are we and they going to do the following year?  And
the year after that?  I'm sure your military think-tanks have walked
through the scenarios and have a good handle on the likely outcomes, but
they aren't really talking at this time.  (And of course, I wouldn't trust

Ok.  That may well be true.  And it is a step in the right direction. However I would guess that the long-term stable state of Afghanistan is
entirely up in the air.  Barring coups and such I guess we'll have to
revisit the Afghanistan question in a few decades.  At that time, and
after they've had a little practice with the democratic process, we'll
probably have a much better idea of how well their liberation from the
taliban went. I suspect that not many of them get to the civilised portions of the
Internet all that often.
You gotta admire the hands-on leadership style, at the very least.
Of course.  All the soldiers just packed up and moved on, or retired into
the relative and mundane obscurity of civilian life.
No, I imagine that isn't very likely.  So, it is clear that the answer is
to bomb the snot out of any country that harbours terrorist warlords. Then, we send in the educators and election facilitators.  Correct?

That should be a no-brainer.
Like they're going to admit otherwise...
Look, managing the perception of friendly fire statistics is super-easy. All you have to do is use a little set-theory to define all casualties of
war as enemies.  Presto!  No more friendly-fire incident paperwork.
Take me, for example.  The good government of Canada has been slowly but
surely flushing my life down a toilet for years and years, perhaps even
with the help of foreigners.  (Don't ask, it's a long story.}  However it
is only in the last four or five years that the authorities in question

what I do in the course of conducting my own self-defense[2] operation. 911 didn't hurt them any either.
The end result is that I become an enemy of the state as a direct
consequence of the attentions and interference of state actors.  No causal
chain is allowed to officially exist linking a state-sponsored
`harassment' campaign with my subsequent bad attitude, thus I
automatically become the Bad Guy(tm), who then deserves a total loss of
civil rights and forfeiture of present and future personal property

@_subject: Optical Tempest FAQ 
Every resistor/cap is different, as is just about every other electronic
component that you might find in either analogue or digital circuits --
including clock crystals.  Even VLSI chips cut from the same die will
exhibit (very) subtlely different analogue electrical properties as a
consequence of their initial physical location on the wafer.  Therefore,
it is reasonable to expect that otherwise "identical" CRT monitors will
exhibit subtle differences in signal timing, amplitude, and phase when
their primary and intermediate outputs are examined in detail. If I'm not entirely off the mark, this means that RF tempest gear can in
principle differentiate same make-and-model CRT devices.  This does not
mean that the suggestion is without merit, as it is likely that `jamming'
your primary monitor with another will make things somewhat more difficult
for an eavesdropper.  But that just means that he may have to hook up his
antenna directly to the water mains instead of sitting in his van down the
As to the validity of this strategy to combat optical tempest, I am not
sure.  I would look up the state-of-the-art in audio-signal filtering to
see what can be done today to differentiate similar mixed signals.  All in all I would suspect that to get halfway decent jamming, you would
have to synchronise your two monitors so that the video frames on each
were being started at the same instant, while also using different sources
and signals.  That is likely beyond the capability of anyone who is not
fairly good with electronics; off the top of my head I cannot suggest how
I would thing about doing it.

I've only read vague hints and rumours concerning its implicit design

actual use must reveal its purpose and function to some degree.  And sure,
we know that feds and other ne'er-do-wells have a bug up their ass about
revealing sources and methods (unlike the public, who have no practical

Wrong.  The origin quote is "Who is Socrates, now that we need him"
written by Richard Mitchell as the title of chapter one in "The Gift of

this context it is the origin quote.  Ms. Harsh is in posession of the
original physical vector, having stolen it, but only the spooks will be
unofficially aware of that facet of the context.
Any non-spook readers (if any) can identify the copycats as spooks by

enough that it is highly unlikely that anyone outside of English academia

On further reflection, I think it is necessary to go out on a limb and
suggest a correction to my comment above.
I "verified" the original quotation from a quick google search.  That was
probably not enough.  My recollection suggests that the original quote
should be "where is Socrates now that we need him".  I rather suspect that
the people who 0wn the upstream pipe from my points of access are toying
with their ability to interpose their data in place of quasi-authoritative
texts.  I cannot consult the physical document owing to the fact that its
rarity is such that there are no copies available at either the Metro
Central Reference Library, and I have no access to the stacks at the
University of Toronto Robarts library.  Someone who does may consult the
book themselves with its call number:  B72 .M55 1987.
Further, Ms. Harsh may be said to posess the probable physical vector.  I
cannot say what level of participation she has had in this travesty owing
to the fact that after she perjured herself in court in 2001, she has
entirely avoided using her actual identity online.  However, she could
answer the question with her copy of the book in principle if there were
any way to compel her testimony.  It is possible that the quote is being
used as a source by online spooks by virtue of the text's presence in
their funky everything database.
Any way you look at it, the phrase "tax money well spent" would seem to
apply here.

before their index entries propogated across to the entirety of the index

You'd think that the development of software intended to be used by the

be contracted out to a firm with existing connections to the government
law enforcement community.  But at that time, I suppose it could be said
that computer security and trust issues would have little chance of being

Presumably today the award of software development contracts follows a
rigid and formal protocol -- for the protection of both parties.
There are more general principles of information theory that apparently
apply to any instance in which code and a dictionary are used to process
information.  I believe that the extraction of information from such
processes at arbitrary points of access is something of a black art.
So goes the contemporary non-specialist understanding of the field.
Quite.  If you want to get any actual work done, the process exposes you
to the risk of leaking information to third-parties.  Assuming that is not
what is intended, I suppose you can spend a metric shitload of money on
measures designed to mitigate against specific risks, without any
guarantee of success.
In .5M LOC, just about anything is possible.  However, I don't believe
that  back-door code would have had anything to do with enhancing the
vulnerability of the system to TEMPEST attacks.
I've heard rumours suggesting that arbitrary bus signals (SCSI, PCI, FSB)
are radiated with the same promiscuity as are monitor signals.  IIRC, a
sharp right-angle trace on a circuit board will allow the emmission a
detectable RF signal, contingent only on the sensitivity and proximity of
a suitably configured receiver.  Presumably the expense of designing
digital electronics with the criterion of minimising radiated signals is
not worth the bother for the vast majority of devices.  The status quo of
the commodity consumer market for computers and peripherals suggests that
the primary design criterion is the minimisation of manufacturing cost. Function and security criterion are necessarily compromised.
Don't get me started.  Social engineering on a grandiose scale; and that's
just about all anyone (in or out of the entertainment industry) needs to
know about Hollywood:  foresight that can be measured in calendar months;
ethics that make the BATF look good, etc.

That paragraph could easily be modified to make it a commentary on my
posting habits, or indeed, on my general presentation from day to day. So, I will comment.
On a pseudo-random but cyclic schedule, I am harassed, provoked, or
otherwise experience incidents of aggression of one sort or another.  This
affects my mood and general state of mind to varying degrees. Furthermore, I do not have consistent dietary intake, nor do I live in an
environment which allows or provides privacy, security, or consistency
save that which I impose with the expenditure of a great deal of effort
and patience.
If you also consider the fact that I have been variously poisoned in
recent years with everything from sedatives to stimulants to hormones to
psychoactive compounds to low-level hallucinogens, and as well have been
subjected to uncounted appeals to my subconscious in the main through the
use of direct and indirect sexually exploitative imagery and encounters,
you might get the idea that consistent literary output is simply not in
the offing.
Before anyone goes to the trouble of suggesting that I discuss matters
with the police, I'll save them the bother.  The police have entirely
failed to allow my allegations the courtesy of a hearing.  Not even once. I belive that those who have not merely dirties their own hands in some
way, are too chikenshit to recognise some of the more subtle criminality
that goes on in this country.  Or they may be intimidated by the kind of
agency[1] that has invoved itself in the kind of clandestine activity that
is at issue.
Add in the fact that I've been dealing with _some_ sort of malicious and
interfereing bullshit for quite a few years without any sincere assistance
of any sort beyond the odd informational giveaway of dubious provenance,
and you might well conclude that whatever else is going on, I'm not a
happy camper.  Perhaps my inconsistent presentation mimics the
inconclusive partial criterion for certain classical mental afflictions. This is convenient as such afflictions are conveniently viewed by the
layman and professional alike as having an origin that is entirely
internal to the individual in question.
However, I have quite a bit of evidence of varying grades that support my
position rather well.  Time will tell, perhaps, the true nature of the
matter in a fashion that leaves no doubt in the mind of the uninvolved
But in the interim, that will have to stand as my overbrief outline of the
reason why I exhibit inconsistency in writing, speech, and action.  I am
simply way too busy dealing with what can in one way be viewed as a
chronic and personalised denial of service attack.
Perhaps Tim May has an entirely different set of factors influencing his
online behaviour.  You will have to ask him to explain his circumstances,
and hope that he consents to it.
As for my case, I do not really wish to make it a topic of discussion on
the Cypherpunks list.  The law enforecement (and perhipheral) personnel
who have involvement in my affairs, for whatever reason, are (and should
be) fully aware of the external influences on my psychology.  They have
the investigative tools and authority to make definitive findings of fact,
and to take corrective action should they find incidents of criminal
liability, but as yet have refused to do so.  And *that* is another matter

I can't say what the legal practice is in Canada.  I imagine it depends on
whether the legal proceedings are politically charged; whether the cops
are out to discover evidence, or if they are looking to destroy evidence;
or any of a number of motivating factors.
police would ever need to keep the computers and all copies of data
related to an investigation.  It is possible to image everything on a hard
disk in an afternoon, including the extra bits available through, say,
the, READ LONG(10) command in the SCSI protocol, which are normally used
for ECC and CRC on each sector.  Depending on the device, it may also be
possible to access the spares tracks.  In the rare event that a forensics firm is looking to scoop data that was
overwritten, the police should be able to provide a copy of the original
data back to the individual or business at a trivial cost in comparison to
the costs of the forensic proceedures.  Apart from data stored in flash
memory, or similar less common places, there is no good reason why the
actual computer hardware would need to be confiscated, except in the most

to acquire hardware that duplicates the original, so that they cannot be
said to have tampered or damaged the originals.
For correctness, the original computer equipment should be used once for
the acquisition of a read-only copy of the data residing on it.
However, it seems that the police will pretend that they are more
incompetent than they actually are in order to use confiscation as
extra-judicial punishment -- and that is just the common case where there
are only legitimate legal proceedings at issue.
In some cases, the police (in canada) are apparently willing to go to
great lengths to destroy evidence and impose extra-judicial sanction on
the subject of an `investigation', which may not exist at all in a legal

carried out over a period of about three years, in an incrimental fashion

accompanied a subtle PR campaign that sought to suggest that there was

Alright.  Time for a little 'fun'.
 I like the nomenclature of AI: it makes for an interesting tool in the
analysis of day-to-day interpersonal relations.  Here, for instance, I am
in the habit of making a mental note of the above as a frame axiom, one
which is intended to influence the state of the fluents that might be said
to accompany this message, or which are intended to be assumed by it.
So, Mr. Erickson here wishes to assert and emphasise that he is a "stupid
cypherpunk", a proposition that may or may not conflict with extant
fluents held by readers of Cypherpunks.  Or, put another way, it might
conflict (or be designed to conflict) with frame axioms that Mr. Erickson
knows or suspects to be held by his audience.  Without knowing the
internal mental state of Cypherpunks' subscription base, and without
knowing the frame within which Mr. Erickson is operatiing (either his
'global' frame, or the 'local' frame of convenience that he may have
adopted), it is nearly impossible to infer what he or she is intending by
writing a statement like "I am a stoopid Cypherpunk" when its banality
might suggest to some that it is blatantly insincere.
There's really nowhere to take this digression, what with the limited
information that is available in context, and so we can only speculate as
to what relation Mr. Erickson's possible stoopidity has to the topic at
hand, which is (if we are to take the message at face value), that he is
concerned with a complaint about a bad eBay sale, which is the
responsibility of someone using the name "Steve Thompson", and which was
made to Cypherpunks (a known spook-haven[1]), via an anonymous message
that appears to have been sent through a cypherpunks remailer.
Yes, it is quite odd.
That condition may satisfy the principle of least hypothesis, which has
much to recommend it, but is it really the likely scenario?
Without a detailed psychological workup on the person who sent the
message, the question is largely indeterminate.  Perhaps the person making
the complaint was coincidentally familiar with anonymous remailers prior
to their interaction with eBay.
I am not sure whether that conclusion is supported by the data available
at this time.
To someone who is genuinely 'stoopid', perhaps.
Did you just happen to notice?
I have informally noted a number of messages in which the authors purport
to present information that seeks to damage or modify another's
reputation, using a variety of subtle language- and psychology-oriented
special effects.  Whether one puts stock in the veracity of each instance
is probably a matter of personal preference; expediency and convenience in
such a busy environment dictates that for practical reasons one simply
cannot chase down every half-assed assertion merely to verify its
In the print and televised media, the flood of information shovelled at
the reader (or watcher) is such that distortions, omissions, and outright
falsehoods are expected to lodge in the public mind as they accompany a
wealth of otherwise useful information that is of some accuracy.  The
repetition of like falsehoods is carried out over time with the
expectation that it will be reinforced.
A favoirite example of mine is to be found in one of the two local
entertainment weeklies.  Recently it was asserted that `reincarnation is
the new black' in reference to the intended memetic propogation of the
associated frame axioms, and their intended effect on the readers' fluents
vulnerable to modification by the memes in question.  My tentative
analysis of the PR intent prompted me to stop reading the weekly in

drivel.  In my case, I feel there are much better things to spend time on

Why  We  Put You There?
The subject header is very nice.
 You say that like it's a bad thing.  The real world, that is.  Most people
find that the real world isn't all bad, and get on with their lives.
Oh, it's even simpler to deal with than that.  Technology (for real this
time) will eventually make air travel, at it's current state-of-the-art,
obsolete, thus obviating the immediate inconveniences that spur like
complaints.  It's all simply a matter of obtaining the proper perspective.
This is fairly cogent.  In the real world, large bureaucracies are not so
good at handling a wide variety of different things.  Corporations usually
specialize in one major product area, and don't do so well when they
expand into areas that differ too much from their core product.  Don't
blame the ACLU too much, it's really not their fault if they fail to fully
leverage their expertise and influence in every single case.
That's strange.  I find that one's personal life is never really much of a
concern to for most people in our society.  I know a large number of
people, personally, who give virtually no thought to their own lives
outside of work.  Myself, I am also inclined in that direction.  Today, most of the people I know are out satisfying their Christmas
obligations.  And while those who choose to enjoy the season are fully
engaged in the spirit of merrymaking, it is very nice that at least the
holiday is entirely voluntary.  So far, I have not had to fight off any
Christmas carolers, nor have I received any unpleasant gifts (although I
will tell you more later about the non-Jewish group I saw recently that
seemed to be confused by Chanukah).  Which is why, incidentally, that I
rarely have to care about my personal life.  As much as can be expected,
my personal life caries on in the best way possible, thus requiring none
of the time and attention that would be better directed elsewhere.
These things happen from time to time.  The best advice that you could
give to the original author would be to suggest that he relax and wait
until the incident passes.

it would amuse the list and so resent.)

They should set up a snitch line, so to speak, so that the general public can report, possibly even by email, incidents of small-scale terrorism and potential terrorism that they might witness as they go about their daily lives.  It couldn't hurt.  In fact, such a move would easily eliminate any question of institutional bias in reference to the selection criterion used to evaluate whether any given incident qualifies as terrorism or not.
I'm not usually one to come out in favour of government database systems, but for something like the terrorism database (which has the potential to greatly enhance the security of democracy and law), what's there not to like about it?

You might be more accurate to say that a permanent [civil] war in Iraq
benefits miltiary leaders and civilian contractors with a variety of
benefits.  Of course, I am quite stupid about a great many subjects and
consequently I may not be able to fully appreciate the benefits that
trickle down to the American public from being `part' of a
theocratic-military pseudo-oligarchy.  Perhaps such an arrangement makes
the best of the human condition and I am merely too inferior to appreciate
the fact.
Well this is to be expected if one studies the field of game theory.  And
given that reality, there is really no point in using psychology and
legislation to mitigate against the dictatorship of the proletariat. Vulnerable minorities might as well lie back and enjoy the inevitable
loving attentions of the majority, eh?
You're dreaming.  People simply do not learn from history.  Never mind the
fact that the historical record is largely incomplete and of course
written by the victors; what does survive in the history of the species
entirely fails to teach individuals and cultures the errors of primitive
and barbaric ways.
Of course this may change in the future.  The Christian crusaders, to use
but one trivial example, did not have television and the History Channel
at the time when they were working themselves into a frenzy in preparation
for war.
Many things would be nice if [group A] were busy killing [enemy B] instead
of [group C].  Sadly, this is not a perfect world and the people who need
the most killing do not, generally speaking, get it.
Perhaps it is a bit of a shame that the kind of broken person who ends up
becoming a suicide bomber, a Ted Kaczynski, a Timothy McVeigh, or even a
Jim Sikorski, cannot be identified early on by some sort of DNA screening
technology and then channeled into an appropriate military program in
which they might be trained to use their special talents against truly
worthy enemies of the state.

[pardon the redundancy]
True, but there's a question of the waste of resources and man-years that
would come from such a circumstance.  And then there's the ethical[1] side
of the coin: do the (largely financial benefits) that might come from a
civil war in Iraq really justify the consequent standard-of-living for the
residents of Iraq?  People like Tim May might say that the towel-headed
barbarians deserve to be killed in a bloody civil conflict, but other
people might argue that there are stable states that do not actually
require heavy foreign civilian losses.
As to who is correct, I cannot say.  As a relatively new student of
history I am still researching the topic.
Aren't we all about to run out of oil soon anyways?
Of course.  It's much easier to smash things than it is to create; and
smashing requires much less wisdom.  On average; depending on how one goes
about `smashing' a nation-state.  I imagine that nation-building, or
nation-`shaping', would be quite hard -- and what if such efforts were to
go awry?  The consequences might be terrible.
If you've been practising pitting groups of barbarians against each other,
as is apparently the case for those involved with the military
intelligence community, then yes, I suppose it might be considered
`astonishingly easy'.  I would also be inclined to suggest that those
sorts of arrangements are quite expensive, regardless of their degree of
I suppose that Americans are getting shot and dying because they are being
paid to engage in high-risk operations.  The risk-taking probably makes
them feel more like manly-men -- until they bleed out all over the desert
sand, of course.  Is there a psychologist in the house who might shed more
light on this kind of risk-taking behavior?
Well, my opinion is such that the major lesson that [a few] people end up
learning from history is how to make conflict seem more legitimate to
increasingly better educated populations.  But there is evidently a long
way to go before the enterprise of warfare is perfected.   As to other
lessons learned from history, it is evident that we as a species have
learnt that war remains profitable under all conditions.  This is now a
matter of the most sacred orthodoxy to high-culture.  Do not worry.  I
will not presume to challenge such a strongly-held belief.
How about, "Where is Ted Kaczynski now that we really need him?"
Um, what planet are you on?
The people who, as you say, organize large scale terror tend to be
protected by virtue of large bureaucratic firewalls, legislated secrecy,
misdirection (smoke and mirrors), and even taboos.  But perhaps you are
not referring to Western terrorists, but are expecting your reader to
assume that terrorists always wear turbans, and who generally will live
and operate in the Middle-Eastern theatre.  Perhaps you have forgotten
about the people who planned and executed the operations that helped
South-American tyrants form up and train their death- and terror-squads?
Who was it, by the way, who coined the name "Death and Horror, Inc."  My
memory is a little hazy, but I don't believe it was Bin Laden.

way your eyes shift according to carefully structured
stimulae, and of course your spending patterns -- all
these things will help the cause of profiling.
Remember: petty inconveniences that make travel on
average less pleasant and more onerous are not at all
intended to facilitate tightened centralised control
of civilian life.  That it may actually do so is an
unintended side-effect.

Keith Henson Needs Help (MLP)
By Baldrson
Wed Sep 15th, 2004 at 07:42:14 AM EST
Anyway, back to the question: Why should you care?
Maybe you don't like Scientology.
Maybe you like Keith.
Maybe you just like to mess with the California government.
Whatever, Keith Henson is asking for help and he quite probably actually
needs it.
This is interesting.  I haven't had the time to follow much of Mr. Henson's case; either the refugee claim, or the subsequent deportation proceedings.  I do recall that he was incarcerated at the Metro West Detention Center while some of his legal maneouvers were being heard in Oakville, and that won't have been very pleasant at all.
People who belong to The Church of Scientology seem to comprise a rather nasty group, and I am not surprised to hear that there are people who fear their reach and influence.  Of course, the US justice system has a number of problems that have been well documented in recent years, and is obviously no walk in the park for anyone who runs afoul of it for whatever reason.  But given that, I can't imagine the naoveti of thought that would lead someone to believe that Canada (and its judicial system) is so much better as to make it worthy as a haven for contemporary US dissidents.
The Church of Scientology is obviously somewhat active here, at least as  far as I can detect; as are other [religious] special-interest groups. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, officials of government here seem only too willing to allow all manner of tomfoolery and hi-jinks to play out alongside the official processes of law.  Tangentially, the Globe and Mail recently printed an article that used the phrase "asymetrical government" to seemingly describe the recent change of character to the practises of federal governance in Canada.  I can't imagine that bodes well considering the term's likely relation to 'asymetric warfare', but then perhaps some bored PSYOPS expert is merely having a little fun with Globe readers.
However, notwithstanding the spectre of improved 'asymmetric' Canadian government, I am not too intelligent in these matters and so there could be some very significant differences up here that makes it an attractive destination for refugees fleeing your own very Happy Fun Government.  It is a truism to say that people sometimes do the strangest things and that their motives are often extremely obscure, and so I am not surprised to find myself mystified on occasion.  Why, I don't believe I even really appreciating the subtleties of John Gilmore's current civil action against the USG over airline security screening procedures.  Politics really is quite complex these days for the nonexpert.
If Keith had asked me before he decided to set out for Canada, I probably would have advised him then that this is no utopia of jurisprudence and fair play.  Sure, if one has enough (but not too much) money to spare, this can be a nice place, but I am told that the same holds true for Chile.  There are tiers of access to public services and no exemplary history available to hold up as evidence to support the idea of Canada as much of a sanctuary from the excesses of certain malign foreign government actors.  And, sure, I have not travelled about Canada extensively so I can personally only attest to the existence of malign domestic government and non-government actors in the Greater Metropolitan Toronto area.  Other provinces could be much, much better than Southern Ontario.
Of course my cynicism and discontent could be mostly a product of, and reaction to being more or less unilaterally hung out to dry by my friends, acquaintances, and the officials of my immediate experience in recent years.  (Incidentally, I can't say that I haven't learned some important bits of data from pseudonymous benefactors, but the fact of pseudonymity and indirection in such instances is really not very comforting.  [shit]  And furthermore, study, induction and deduction, as well as a whole bunch of testing comprise _the_ major contributors to what little peace of mind I posses if bound literature is excepted.  Help is clearly a commodity in short supply around here.)
Anyhow, Keith's failed refugee claim is clearly significant.  Considering my calendar at the moment I don't think there's much that I can do to help, unfortunately.  I will watch, though, and I'll be be interested to see exactly how the final moves play out in his case.

Well, duh.  Controlling who perceives what about any given operation is
part of the process.  Contrariwise, discovering the particulars about who
is fucking who is part of the process of analysing the operations of an
adversary.  With government-class agencies, both sides of any given action
will often be aware of the efforts of their opposites to use
counterintelligence techniques to obscure and conceal tactical and
strategic goals.
This is why it is so much easier when they are running an operation
against smaller adversaries.  Little guys don't have access to the kind of
intelligence products that would allow them to protect themselves.
Assuming that they have not already had the foresight to run their own
popular public email services through cut-outs, and/or infiltrated
existing services with their personnel...
One imagines that is true.
Not necessarily, but then most people seem to underestimate the guile of
people who have the intellect and buisiness sense to create and run large
and successful corporations.
A tempest attack on the computer(s) you use to access your email accounts
would be the easiest method, I would think, second only to sniffing your
ethernet or WAN traffic.  Remember, it's only illegal if they get caught
in the act, and as we know, TLAs and security companies jealously guard
their sources and methods to the point where they will collect the same
information twice (or more, if they have big budgets) if it will serve to
disguise the kind and use of their initial and more secretive and possibly
very illegal methods.
So, what's the colour of the sky on your planet?
I would suspect so.  Given the prior importance given to key escrow by US
TLAs, we know that the people in these departments are heavily invested in
the idea that mere mortal citizens should not have access to secure
systems.  It is only an effort of the imagination to speculate on the
various attacks that might be perpetrated on the 'control points' of
civilian information system security infrastructure to gain an idea of the
ways in which our ability to acquire personal security may be compromised
by the 'l33t control-freaks who inhabit SpookWorld.
Personally, I believe that I fail to receive an unknown amount of email
and telephone communications because of cut-out mediated privacy invasions
of the kind that you suggest here.  In the trivial case, some asshole
might periodically log-in to my email accounts and delete (after copying)
incoming messages that their masters feel that I should not see. Obviously this could also be done by way of various kinds of
man-in-the-middle attack.

Good point.  As many of us know, there are groups of well-educated people
who spend all their time on the analysis of technology: think tanks.  Who
can possibly say what sorts of universal, 'machine-readable'
identification systems are considered, and which modes of use they
imagine?  Many of the studies that are conducted under the umbrella of
think tank resarch is, of course, proprietary and restricted in
distribution.  Knowledgable individuals can do only so much (in their
spare time, for instance) towards doing their own analysis of leading-edge
technology use and misuse, and most people know this.  So, why is it that
there seem to be no open source groups who, like people in the free
software movement might write software, produce non-trivial papers on the
results of their brainstorming sessions?
If we can agree that the research of closed NSA think-tank groups might be
of immense interest to people with a vested interest in the use or misuse
of emerging technologies, then it follows that open source intelligence
analysis of technology is a field that is both very much wide-open for
exploration, and also quite critical.  People like Bruce Schneier do a
good job more or less on their own in their respective fields, but it
seems that there is likely a significant quality gap in what can be done
by individual experts, and what might be accomplished by groups of savvy
intellectuals.  However, the playing field is such in the public realm most discussion and
analysis of these kinds of issue are relegated to science fiction,
academic journals, mailing lists, and of course blogs.  There seems to be
a reluctance on the part of a great many people to bring a more rigorous
and wide ranging type of analysis to such fields, and I am not quite sure
Nevertheless, for those who are at all aware of the kind of product
produced by conventional think-tank groups, it is evident that there are
large gaps in the areas of consideration and fields of study covered by
the open-source analysis field.  This obviously affects the quality of
debate in the public sphere.
"Normally I am very careful before I ascribe such sinister motives to a
government agency. Incompetence is the norm, and malevolence is much
rarer. But this seems like a clear case of the Bush administration putting
its own interests above the security and privacy of its citizens, and then
lying about it."
I have a different threat model.  I suggest that incompetence is _often_
deliberate and, at least to those who orchestrate such things, is designed
to leave or provide cracks in arbitrary systesm that will be expoited. This may be defensible in cases where someone wants to encourage child
molesters to expose their operations to sophisticated intelligence and

@_subject: [i2p] weekly status notes [feb 1] (fwd from 
Ha ha.
Just why is it that "we" should post "up" our thoughts when it is now the norm to ignore such thoughts if they (a) come from the
'wrong' source, or (b) if said thoughts do not mesh in the approved fashion with the agendas of the moment?
I've recently come to a realisation that the reason why most
people are accepting of the current environment of highly tuned and structured radio/television media and news content is that the common themes underlying most such input gives people a false sense of inclusion and belonging.  Sure, the cognitive neural structures that become trained and tuned to
one broad class of input leverage some of the basic and flexable architecture of the human mind, and this leads to what some would consider a higher commonality of performance
in communication and interaction with like others, but the loss of fundamental flexability in thought and debate in
public spaces is an unacceptable compromise in so far as
I am concerned.
Excuses that in turn leverage the idea that the present status-
quo is the best we've got at the moment, in terms of fostering
a community of purpose among people of a single culture, and
also in terms of avoiding an `unproductive' factionalisation
of the citizenry, strike me as being without sustainable merit.
Am I making sense here, or is this merely superficially
obfuscated surplus verbiage?  You decide.  In the meantime
I will further consider, in my few moments of quiet and solitude, the negative aspects of the current state in which
civil and human rights are selectively applied only to those
who kiss ass in the 'approved' fashion.  ______________________________________________________________________ Post your free ad now!

Well we all know that having complete control over one's own
computer is far too dangerous.  Obviously, it would be best if
computers, operating systems, and application software had proprietary back-doors that would enable the secret police to
arbitrarily monitor the all goes on in the suspicious and dark
recesses of memory and the CPU.
Hell, I trust the secret police to use such capabilities for moral and legitimate purposes only, and as we all know the people who become secret police are of the best and brightest
stock of humanity and will allways act in the best interests of mankind.  Corruption and fraud among such elites will be
impossible, particularly if current standards of law and morality continue to be applied with the consistency we are
now accustomed to.
Personally, I have no fear that you, the members of this group, who I am barely qualified to address online, and who
represent some of the best people the Internet has to offer,
would not be the ones best suited to control the computing
infrastructure of the Earth's people.  And in that vein, I offer the following job tip as a token
of my confidence.  In today's Globe and Mail newspaper there
is an advertisment from the CSE (Communications Security

Interesting that you say the "FBI/DHS" have a policy of "fictionalizing"
[homeland] "threats", but suggest that Jim Bell is a victim of such
fictionalization rather than an example of a fictionalised threat.
Probably back in about 2001, my Government Cynicism Threat and Alert
System(tm) was upgraded from a rating of Moderate to Near Total Cynicism. Consequently, I re-assessed the words I had read concerning the Jim Bell
case and decided that he was a fake threat designed as input to the
legal/policing system in order to push it in a number of well-defined
directions, tending of course towards tyranny.
Nothing that I have seen or heard of since, directly related to Jim Bell
or otherwise, has led me to believe anything other than threats of the
kind that Mr. Bell are supposed to pose are nothing more than
sophisticated and well orchestrated frauds.  In fact, even such incidents
as the Adobe PDF kerfuffle including Dmitri Skylerov and a cast of
pseudo-hacks in the tech press are indicative of the degree to which the
government and certain segments of the industry and online community are
trained to march in lock-step to the tunes as they are called by certain
special interest groups.
Perhaps the RAND institute might be characterised as one of the
organisations that might be said to steer broad trends in fields and
strategic industries of interest to government control-freaks and would-be
Mind you, I am not necessarily the best or most objective source when it
comes to the analysis of such issues.  As *some* of you know, I allege a
variety of real and utterly indefensable wrongdoings on the part of
various police and government-related officials, but as yet have seen not
the least bit of support come my way despite the value of some of the work
that is at risk.  This is in contrast to petty crap like the RSA script on
a T-shirt bullshit that has previously occupied so many people's
attentions, not to mention media coverage (like "Wired").
But perhaps I am merely not worthy, and that my thoughts on various
matters cannot be trusted, even when they are relevant.  Fraud, after all,
is a rather serious charge.  If one is accusing the Massey Fergeson of the
Industry of perpetrating a massive fraud, then I suppose one requires
rock-solid evidence -- which I admit I cannot possibly produce at this

@_subject: What is a cypherpunk? 
In this day and age, do you realy expect anyone to answer questions like
that openly and honestly?   Really.  There's a similar and simple label
that gets used and abused by people who might either be technically
competent engineers, or merely script kiddies: hacker.
These days, being a hacker is nearly enough the moral equivalent of being
a Communist in California during the Fifties.  Or a leper.  Note how the
term 'hacker' is normally used, as a perjorative, in writings and speech
found in the mainstream media.  If a journalist for Time Magazine uses the
label 'hacker' in a perjorative context, chances are that a letter-writing
campaign launched in earnest for the purpose of reclaiming the defintion
preferred by engineers, will at best produce a tiny correction buried in a
corner of a subsequent issue.  And then some other writer will make the
same mistake later.  The same applies to the term `cyperhpunk', only the term is rarely used
outside of the Internet.  Quite frankly, I couldn't care less what label
applies to me.  I'm somewhat knowledgeable on issues that are said to be
characteristic of the focus of 'cypherpunks', but I don't pray every day
with a reading from the Cypherpunk Manifesto.
Depends on the person, I guess.  Perhaps a comprehensive survey should be done.  A comprehensive
questionaire in the form of a purity test might do it, as might something
like a geek code for 'cypherpunks'...
Do you read Applied Cryptography?
Have you ever generated a 16 kbit RSA key?
Do you have a picture of Ralph Merkle hanging on the wall in your bedroom?
Face it.  You aren't going to get straight answers to questions from
highly technical internet sophisticates, even if you ask politely.  They
have better things to do than to justify and explain their ideologies when
in fact such is easily read from the body of their work, and implicit to
their writings.

Too late.  Stupidity is an entrenched aspect of the system.
If you try to remove stupidity (assuming for the moment that
it could be done in principle) stupid men with guns will hunt you down and shoot you in order to protect their
jealously guarded stupidity _and_ ignorance.  For as we
all know, and particularly in non-trivial fields of knowledge, knowledge often implies or demands action of
a particular kind, according to the logic of the situation.
Strategic ignorance is therefore extremely valuable -- particularly to corrupt government and corporate officers.

@_subject: Hack License 
Interestingly enough, Stallman expects people to use one of the GNU
software licenses when they release a product.  Big deal.  Ideology and people change.  Today the significance of the open source 'movement' being
in conflict with the 'vectorialists', or rather the commercial and
proprietary software community is that the polarization of the industry is
limited to two poles:  commercial, for-pay software or free open-source
software.  Alternatives, or hybrid licensing agreements are generally
unknown to the computing public at large. Thus the software industry largely resembles the basic structure of the
United States federal political system.  Republican, or democrat : open
source, or commercial software.
Code that I have that is waiting for completion and formal release (some
of it has been stolen and distributed in advance of its completion) I
intend presently to license under a hybrid license that essentialy grants
unrestricted use for non-commercial and non-military purposes, but which
requires a license agreement for any commercial use.  My thinking was that under the existing arrangement, commercial vendors
largely benefited from the efforts of many thousands of open-source
developers, thus reducing R&D costs, without necessarily returning
anything either to the community, or to the developers themselves. Furthermore, unless one is a high-profile open-source developer it is next
to impossible to make a living writing code that is given away to free to
all takers.  Of this last problem, it may become moot one day if the world
economy moves away from the use of money as an intermediate medium of
value exchange, but today it is necessary to have money so the developer
can pay his rent and buy food and purchase computer hardware tools.  Of
the former problem, some few vendors have recently exposed their
proprietary software to the open source community.  Sun Microsystems has
recently put their operating system on the table; the NSA released SE
Linux, and of course many smaller examples abound.
There are other considerations that remain largely unaddressed by the
present status quo, however, and I wanted to address some of them.  For
instance, I wanted to stop my software from being used by a military force
in the process of developing proprietary (and presumably classified)
weapons of mass destruction or weapons designed to be used against
[domestic] civilian populations.  Of course, I wouldn't also want my
software to be used by terrorists such as the Ted Kaczinski's of the
world.  As an individual developer, I didn't realistically expect that I
would actually halt the unlicensed use of my software for, say, illegal
purposes, but I did expect to force such people and organisations to
actually have to _steal_ the software rather than handing to them on a
sliver platter, with my tacit blessing.  While the existing judicial and
legislative environment doesn't seem to be friendly to the idea of people
taking responsibility for the purposes that their creations are put to, I
think that software professionals should put some thought to the moral
dimension of the application of their products.
The concept of "know your customer" exists today, however badly it is
deployed by extant legislation.  I believe it may be done well by
intelligent people, and surely it can also be abused.  A group of Klansmen
might release software that contained a licensing agreement restricting
its [free] use to aryans.  I think Tim might say that they should be free
to do so, because "coloured" people as well as concerned caucasions would
have the ability and right to produce nominally equivalent software to
compete with the Klansman's code.  However this view relies on the
minimalist view of government regulation, a point of view that is not much
in favour today.
Whatever the particulars of any given scenario, the point remains that the
two-pole system that dominates the software community has some rather
large holes. I expect that one day I will be able to afford to replace the computer(s)
that were stolen by the local "authorities", despite their ongoing and
malicious interference and harassment.  Then, I may end up finishing off a
few things for release; some of it certainly under the scheme I touch on
above, and some perhaps under a 'true' open-source license.  Some of said
software may even be useful to a non-trivial population of users.  At that
time, I expect to see how well a hybrid licensing scheme works at this
stage of the computer industry's maturation.  Until then, however, There
isn't much to be said about the flexibility of the existing choices:  it's
pretty much either all or nothing.  Ultimately, I don't think that simple
black and white choices will suffice for my purposes.
By the way.  I am entirely unconcerned if the concensus view of current
Cypherpunks subscribers, not to mention Usenet posters, is such that it is
believed that replies to my messages -- if any -- need to be tangential
and distracting, if not oughtright hostile, for whatever reason.  But if
the consensus view is that my thoughts and opinions are to be discounted
by tacit fiat, I would greatly appreciate it if the people who feel
strongly about it would reply in public with a statement to the effect of
"fuck off, we don't want your kind around here" or a statement phrased to
acheive the requisite degree of accuracy given the feeling of the moment. But until I am "voted off the island", as it were, I do not plan on simply
going away merely because of a little unacknowledged and unjustified
intellectual apartheid.

More of the usual bullshit, SOP for the quasi-anonymised defenders of
local trvth.
State _workers_ attack property rights; state _workers_ act to aid 'the
rich' in consolidating and concentrating property and property rights
against 'the poor'.  In exchange for a little job security, state
_workers_ have passivly evolved a neat little system which may be
exploited by knowledgeable insiders for their own malign purposes.  Congratulations to the defenders of Truth, Freedom, and Democracy for in
effect rolling back property rights (to say nothing of human and civil
rights), in effect cancelling the legal advances brought about by the
Magna Carta and succeeding documents.  It is a testament to the success
and current fashion of reality simplification that state agents may
arbitrarily employ the tools of terrorism, appropriation and confiscation,
arbitrary detention, and not insignificantly, micromanage _de facto_
slaves according to their whims, or at least those of their privilaged
benefactors.  This is accomplished by the strategic use of pretexts --
some secret, others validated by tenets of pop culture; none of which may
be assailed by reasonable means -- to lend a veneer of legitimacy to the
acts of violence.  And in this vein I should not need to remind anyone of
the fact that theft, as much as a boot to the head or back of the neck, is
an act of violence; and no matter if it is perpetrated by seeming
officiousness by way in some farcical one-sided and secret legal process,
or by dint of a convenient and contrived necessity.  Uh-huh.  And what of the state of affairs where rights of property, for
example, may be subverted by fraud and the means of legal redress (no
matter how unjust, inefficient and ineffective they may be for practical
purposes) are closed off, one by one, so that the victims of state
violence are allowed NO OPTIONS or RELEIF, perhaps to start again from
scratch, but more likely to whither and die on the vine, ignored except
when it is necessary to reinforce the conditioning to ruin by the
application of a periodic boot to the back of the neck.
And you all may cluck cluck safely in your ivory towers at the sorry state
of others affairs, pontificating (again, safely) at an intellectual remove
from the ground that is in conflict and  Obvioulsly the best way
to seem comitted to change and a solution to difficult problems without
actually risking engagement with the core matter.
This list is becoming a chore to read.  Would someone find out where Tim
May and Detwellier (for a start) are hiding, and please recommend them
back to Cypherpunks?   When such as they were active, we could be assured
of lively and entertaining debate.  These days, the air is rather too thin
to support vigorous and sincere exchange.

I think it's fair to say that governments were initially, and still
largely remain today, the public formalisation of religious rule applied
to the  civil sphere of existence.  It's more complicated than that, but
generally speaking, somewhat disparate religious populations (protestant,
catholic, jew, etc.) accepted the fiction of secular civil governance when
in reality religious groups have tended to dominate the shape and
direction of civil government, while professing to remain at arms-length.
'Fiction' is the operative term here, and I contend that nowhere is this
more evident in the closed world of clandestine affairs -- civilian OR
military.  Religion has always been about 'powerful' and educated in-sect
sub-populations organising civil and intellectuall affairs in such a way
as to mobilise the serfs to the advantage of the privilaged, all the while
presenting convenient systems of fiction to the masses that are expected
to suffice as the broad official reality of society; a reality fully
accessable to some who quite naturally use their position of possibly
intellectual privilage to order the affairs of the serf/slaves.
If I'm not mistaken, it was in Germany where the concept of public
figureheads-as-leaders was evolved to a system in which the figurehead
(king, pontiff, leader) was presented as the soruce of state power, but
who in actuality was groomed, controlled, and ruled by a non-public
contingent of privilaged political and intellectual elite who, in general,
ran the affairs of state and/or religion from the back room, so to speak.
This way of organising the public affairs of government has, I think,
roots that date back to the ancient Greeks, but is also largely in favour
It's rather different today.  Agreements and accords such as the Berne convention and the DCMA, to say
nothing of human-rights legislation, are hobbled by the toothlessness of
enforcement, pulic apathy to others' rights, and a load of convenient
exceptions to such rules made for the agents of state.  For instance, the
copyright on my computer software was blithely subverted by the fascist
ubermench involved and responsible for the surveillance detail that I have
suffered over the past two decades.  I listened to some of these people
make excuses for stealing my intellectual property, fashioning rumours to
lessen the wrong of their theft, or 'merely' applying pressure or making
plans to 'encourage' the release of my code in the public domain so their
prior theft could be buried.  Failing that, they have simply stolen all my
computer equipment and delayed my life, possibly so my code could be
`developed' by their own programmers and a history shown -- perhaps with
the partial aim of finally accusing me of stealing "their" intellectual
property after it is released in their own product.
These people are nothing more than jack-booted thugs, and whether they are
Nazis or not is immaterial to the fact that their methods and ideology
closely resemble a modernised version of it.   Whatever the EXCUSE
offered, it is a triumph of putocratic-fascist zeaotry in the sense that
nominally modern and democratic institutions and groups in this world have
acquired some of the memes that drove the Gestapo/SS/Abwher.  There is no
excuse, but since Orwellian political and intellectual abdications and
maneuvers are quite well in fashion today, it is obviously stylisn to
pretend that such things do not and cannot possibly occur.  Hence the
stupefying silence over what is bloody fucking obvious to anyone with half
a brain.

Bzzt.  I call you on your bullshit.
Supposedly by convention, individuals attach some of a set of symbol
relations to physical objects and ideas and processes.   Such relations,
when observed consistently, confer rights of posession and use to groups
or individuals.  Individuals employed by governments, as well as special
interest groups, are certainly no longer satisfied with a democratic
arrangement of property rights and have manufactured consent, as it were,
to establish a bunch of exceptions to property rights that allow for
`legalised' theft.
But as long as property rights are generally considered to be a tenet and
characteristic of society, excuses for officiated theft, for instance,
merely put a veneer of legitimacy over certain kinds of theft.  I doubt
that RMS will ever be framed, arrested and thrown in to the gulag, his
property confiscated; but for someone like myself, that is certainly an
option, eh?  ______________________________________________________________________ Post your free ad now!

Unless if it's by accident.
Operative word:  excuse.
Or like maybe the NSA needs to steal something that they can't buy because
they "NEED" to conceal the project that requires the stolen item.  Or
maybe a wealthy interest has a commercial interest to protect and bribes
an official to steal land that threatens said interest.  Or maybe it's a
Klan member who thinks that niggers shouldn't own property, and so he
steals it.  Or perhaps it's a Xtian who believes it's God's will to deny
property rights to heathens, as a lesson in coming to God.  Or maybe it's
a bunch of fucking theives who use any excuse they have at hand to justify
their own greed.
Sometimes it's a complete load of shit, and there's no real valid reason
that will stand intelligent scrutiny as to why some people are allowed to
do one thing that is denied to another people.
Personally, I believe that the people who run the US, the dirty ones, are
too well aware of the liabilities they have assumed as a matter of course
in their history, and who will do anything rather than face paying the
debt.  Anything.   And futher, this conclusion is not so foreign as to be
beyond comprehension, but rather represents a problem that no-one is
willing to deal with -- thus compounding the error.

@_subject: Brin needs killing, XIIV 
To leave the attributions and headers, or not?   I was naive once too.  As we all know, 'freedom' is a value-neutral term when used on it's own, without a suitable modifier, as in
the above.
I imagine that most people, in the fuzzy space of
colloquial conceptions, associate 'privacy' with the
information security of their own lives, and associate
`secrecy' with the concealment of corporate or government
information, processes, and assets.  But we may use the
terms interchangeably if it makes you happy.  To wit: I have secrets which I would like to keep from malicious criminals and other government workers.
Ok, that is a nice idea but...
Given the information-centric disparity that already
exists between individuals of varying allegiance or
association, how is it possible to assure that most
everyone is brought up to speed on the current state-
of-the-art in the numerous fields of study and technology that relate to intelligence and counter-
intelligence in such a way as to make the playing
field level for all?  As it stands, with the mutability
inherent in the acquisition and interpretation of signals and surveillance data, it is too easy for large masses of people to acquire widespread mis-
conceptions about the veracity of the information
at their disposal.  Put another way: hypothetical well-organised dis-information sophisticates could
in theory arrange to give the masses a false sense of security and inclusiveness within a subtly
fraudulent framework of public-mediated surveillance
and information sharing.  Perhaps this could be arranged by building backdoors and covert access
points in the public surveillance network which would allow the 'cabal' to diguise their activities
while also permitting them to arbitrarily muck
about with the publically availble data, subject only
to constraints imposed by the actual state-of-the-art --
enhanced on a practical level by virtue of limiting
in some ways the technology available to the masses.
If that makes sense to you, then it should become obvious that certifying the `public surveillance network' free compromise by privilaged elites of
any kind becomes a very difficult task.  And as we
all know, groups like the NSA and their foreign counterparts already enjoy an indeterminate lead
on the public in areas of interest and relation to
information technology and surveillance.  So, how do
we as average citizens mitigate the threat of being
lulled into a false sense of security by the flashy
newness of some kind of hypothetical BrinWorld public surveillance and sharing network?
Clearly this is a large problem, and I certainly don't
have the answer.  But, I think the idea of BrinWorld is the correct approach, and obviously some very intelligent
people think so too.  I would refer to the paper entitiled
"The Weapon of Openness", by Arthur Kantrowitz, which
approaches this issue from a more general perspective.   Most likely, there is a solution that we all can live with.  Avoiding the risks will, however, be rather
difficult.  Personally, I wouldn't mind too much living in a total surveillance world if I were assured that
everyone else was subject to the same level of scrutiny. This is primarily because I don't engage in activities which are particularly shameful or which are dependent
upon the immoral or wanton explotation and subversion of another person's right to pursue interests that
do not harm others.  I am fully aware that a great
many people do engage in such activities, some of which are cultural rites or religious rituals that
are validated by the tacit legitimacy given to them
by a tyrranical majority.  And then there are people who live off the avails of crime because they find that such activities are `manly', stimulating, or otherwise pleasureable in some way.
I'm not sure that this is the _only_ way, but it is surely the way that looks as though it will acend
to the fore in the near term.
So goes the psychological theory of the moment.  I'm not
so sure that the mechanism is quite so simple as to lend
itself to a reduction that makes it no different to
chemical addiction.
Well, yes.  But we also need to do quite a bit of
work to design the *secure* systems, networks, and
code to make it all happen as it should.

it's personnnel will use torture, fraud, and assassination to (a) advance
their Total Police State Paradise, (b) to run their spook schools, (c) to
steal whatever they want, and (d) to bury the evidence of their
malfeasance.  They will steamroller domestic and foreign civilians and
combatants indiscriminately, held in check only by virtue of the
lamentable practical necessity of appearing to have valid reasons for
actions taken.
Because the judicial branch of government is entirely tame, and because
the media is in the habit of obeying, and because there is a secret
history to the military and SpookWorld that is wrapped up in the mythology
of religion and superstition, there is simply no process extant to address
the inequities of the present time.
The only action on the front, as it were, consists of political and
ideological yes-men banging the drum of conformity and assimilation: "join
us and prosper; obey and serve; destroy the reality that does not support
our orthodoxy".  Dissent is marginalised and criminalised, although
provocations are important in order to provide the fearsome spectacles
necessary to encouraging fear and cultivating obedience.
Too bad there are so many dirty hands.  The necessity of protecting so
many actual establishment terrorists from sanction, legal or otherwise,
may kill billions one day.  Or worse, as death isn't the worst thing that
can occur to an individual... as many of you are aware.
Keep up with the bullshit, folks.  Continue to justify all the repressive
and regressive measures.  Legitimise arbitrary human rights abuses.  Keep
training your terrorists.   Pretend you must use slaves.  Keep lying to
yourselves about the rightness of your approach, and the necessity of the
web of deceits necessary to keeping your veil of propriety afloat.
It's been clear to me for a long time that your little club is morally
bankrupt, although we know that such considerations are entirely obsolete
to the modern ubermench.  Arguing on your terms is a losing proposition. The game was lost a long time ago: when the taboos on certain kinds of
speech became entrenched.  Recapitulations of traditional religious speech
and action into modern forms, such as "interrogation" simply aren't enough
to undo the damage.
By the way, I really enjoy the drugs used today in the service of official
knowledge acquisition.  I sincerely hope that many more people enjoy them
too.  And I would be remiss if I failed to remind everyone who is a player
in this part of SpookWorld to tounge the peanuts from my shit.  War
criminals and cowards all.

I rather doubt that anyone outside of the CIA could really say what they would or would not do in such a situation.  Recall
that people in that world view deceit as much more than a skill.  It's more of a way of life to them, and as a result
of so many years of rounds of layerd deceit colouring their operations, the analysis of their actions is bound to fail
when approached with that kind of simplicity.
Oh, by the way.  The last post I made in reply to you went
unanswered just when I was starting to make some difficult
points.  Surely that was an oversight?

As if.
There already is a kind of intelligent super-fascist state in place
thoughout much of society.  My bugbears of the moment are the police and
courts, so you get my take on how they are organised so as to be
'intelligent' without seeming so -- which further enables a whole lot of
fraud to masqerade as process and incompetence.  The super-fascist part
comes about because the system avoids public accountability while also
somehow evading any sort of reasonable standard of performance.
What's the error rate, that is the false arrest, prosecution, and/or
conviction rate of a Western countries' judiciary and police divitions? If it's even ten percent, and it's probably much higher, then there is no
reason to respect the operation and perpetuation of the system.   And
consider how the courts deal with error.  After all is said and done, the
victim is expected to launch appeals at his own expense to force the
system to take official notice of judicial "error".  We know how dilligent
the police are at bringing creativity to their investigations and arrests.
 Countless examples abound of fraud and abuse of processs.
And the population at large carries on as if it doesn't matter.  Well in my not so humble fucking opinion, if police and judicial officials
in Canada (or the US, or wherever) wish to acquire respect and lend the
appearance of legitimacy to their operations, then they should bloody well
bring some transparent accountability to their operations and more, should
take exacting pains to ensure that they conduct their affairs so as to put
their integrety beyond question for anyone who examines their fucking
books.  And when they *do* err, they should fucking well bend over
backwards to correct their god damn mistakes.  AND when they catch one of
their own abusing his or her position of authority that fucker should be
PILLORIED for the least offense.
But no, this does not and will not occur because the police and courts
have had decades of self-selection in their recruiting processes, and
decades of deirected evolution applied to their internal culture and
processes.  It is considered more proper to rule by fear, than to consider
that wageing a de facto war on the civilian population as being even
slightly wrong.
Since it is considered *normal* for their to be a high error rate, it is
only natural for the intelligent special interest groups within the
government to exploit the lax standards to crushing competing groups and
individuals who might pose a latent threat to the extant corrupt culture. And then there are those nasty writers who won't wedge their ideology into
the narrow confines of mass consumer culture, and well there's all sorts
of legal ways to deal with *that* kind of trouble-maker.  And so on. Petty little tyrants have all sorts of latitude for abuse, but so do real
villans  like the ones directing your military contractors.
State of the art in pulling the strings of government is to view (at
different levels, and different levels of abstraction) departments and
ministries as black boxes with adjustable inputs.  Some "inputs" are more
adjustable than others, of course, and there are levels of access to the
"inputs", but the approach is sound.  I suppose it might take a
well-placed CIA agent to subtly adjust CPIC records to suit an RCMP
officer's relative's influence peddling, but the nice thing about
reciprocal arrangements is that they may be negotiated and traded by
fascist and highly placed warmongers.
And we don't care because most people are brainwashed into blindly
accepting the norm of incompetent ineffiency in all official matters. Indeed, for many it's a game that is only slightly more real than arcade
shoot'em-ups but much more sophisticated.
Of course no individual is at all required to respect such unnecessary
corruption, and I certainly do not.  (Why would I, considering the
marauding warmongers who have been entirely subverting my ambitions and
interests for years, simply because they like the challenge.)
And in continuing with the outing, I predict that God was named John by
his parents, and has official carte blanche to fuck up the lives of
Canadian citizens given to him by his pet dogs in the Canadian government.
Gutless weasels.

I couldn't say, but it is well known that people who are accused
of a crime are given rather large incentives to plead guilty in
order to avoid the lengthly trial process.  This is, of course, a
major point.  However, there isn't much discussion about the lack of accountability for people (police, judicial officials,
etc.) who themselves run afoul of "the law" and who are rarely
punished at all.  And of course there's the lucrative prison
system with it's large union and bureaucracy.  Plus, many people
know about the recruiting facet of that industry in which some
individuals are groomed and incentivised to become agents of the state, in one capacity or another, in exchange for freedom
or lesser sentences.
Insofar as the intel community is concerned, it seems from my
perspective that there is no effective deterrent for violent
crime since you've pretty much got to do something really stupid before they'll prosecute: like cut off your wife's head
and store it in your freezer, or something equally gregarious.
For people in SpookWorld, fraud, larceny, perjury, and murder are merely the tools of the trade.
And don't get me started on about the cartels.

You fucking 'tard; nobody is going to be arrested for carrying a copy of
the NYT.
This deliberate abrogation of the right to be free of unreasonable search
and seizure is typical of the way authorities abuse process.  This sort of
thing happens _all the time_.  Here's how the scam works (for those of you
who require that their information comes pre-chewed):
J. Random Authority will decide that he or she wishes to advance the
incremental fait accompli of the tiered police state.  He or she examines
the political landscape of the moment and identifies a flimsy excuse that
may be used to backstop this-or-that draconian measure.  In this case,
random searches of transit passengers.  It is expected that the flagrant
violation of the law by the authorites for some contrived need will
eventually be examined in court by virtue of some citizen petition that is
made in a fit of outrage or pique.  Depending on the political reality of
the moment, the courts may be encouraged to rule in such a way as to force
the complainant through the expensive and time-consuming task of going in
front of the Supreme Court.  In the meantime, the authorities carry on
with their blatantly illegal activities and wait for the courts to rule
them in the wrong; if that actually occurs -- by no means a sure thing
when science, reason, and logic are habitually excluded from judicial
As a nice side effect, many actions of this sort are undertaken with the
secondary motive of outraging and provoking so-called undesireable
elements within the affected population.  In North America, this is the business-as-usual model of government
interacting with its citizens.  And since every judicial ruling has a
small but finite chance of being ruled in the Government's favour, no
matter how absurd such a ruling might be, the tiered authoritarian and
plutocratic police state is thus incrimentally realized.
Not to mention the subtle, expensive, and time-consuming methods for
putting people and things in-place that tend to be favoured by the Usual

Well, what do you *think* I'm saying?  Perhaps I could clarify my post.
I fail to see the relevance.  Domestic security services haven't spent the last few decades co-opting
the press for nothing.  As far as I'm concerned, it is ludicrous to
suggest that quasi-offical state press organs will produce product that
will in any way be candidate materials for classification as subversive
This premise, however, depends somewhat on the observation that the
so-called left and right-wing divisions of the political spectrum are
largely illusory.  The most strident critics of diametric political
opposites in the press and elsewhere would disagree, but their very
occupations are rather dependent upon the perception that the evident
differences in ideology are more than superficial.  But as far as I'm
concerned, there is no meaningful difference in most cases.
Uh-huh.  Yes, but in the wrong way.  Which makes you either an idiot or a JBT
troll.  Possibly both.
I agree that cell-phones are scary devices, but only because they are
proprietary, and because the phone companies are just as bad as the press
when it comes to co-operating with the so-called law-enfocement community.
 Anyone recall Operation Sundevil and friends?
Blah, blah, blah.
Uh-huh.  Y'know the police planted a stupid story in the local media here
(toronto) not too long ago.  They said that some wack-job had been
deterred from going on a psychotic rampage with his evil guns because he
met a friendly dog in a park, and that the dog made him re-assess his
homocidal/suicidal ideation.  I imgaine the people who thought that one up
should cut down on their intake of hallucinogens and laughing gas.
As for propogating the silly idea that bombs can be detonated by
remote-control with a cell-phone trigger... Well, that's really fucking
stupid.  Any half-wit could do just as good a job with a one-way pager, or
a digital watch -- if he were not so inclined as to cobble toghether a 555
timer and some glue in a shielded enclosure.
As I mentioned elsewhere, science, logic, and fact have no major role to
play in the operation of courts or law enforcement today.  That should be
inexcusable to anyone who expects to rely on science, logic, or fact in
any other areas of life; such as medicine or transportation, for instance.
Well ain't that just too fuckin' bad.

How do you know?
A very good friend of mine once described what you call the "big
microphone" as the panopticon.  Clearly this is not a new idea, and
consequently we may assume that the TLAs are well in advance of whatever
is known about global surveillance by the general public.  Technical
sophisticates have, however, a distinct advantage here.  Furthermore, as I
have stated previously, the use of information gleaned from a surveillance
effort leaks 'bits' about the surveillance action itself -- this is a
mathematical certainty.
But, seeing as how the public is expected to live in a rather small
fantasy world of conceptual and information poverty, at least as such
relates to the activities of TLAs, we can assume that mathematical
realities will have zero correlation with politically motivated policies
in the public `sphere'.
It's likely that "he" is practising his stupidity in order to establish
the background of his mailing-list persona.  Perhaps his messages also
carry coded `freight' of some kind intended for a certain class of reader.
 If so, and if he uses perfect encryption for his coding scheme, we cannot
have any hope of decyphering what he is saying beyond the superficial
face-value of his text.
Don't forget about rubber-hose cryptanlysis.  Rumour has it that method is
preferred in many cases since it makes the code-breakers feel good by way
of testosterone release.

Don't you think it's a little insensitive to stereotype pigs in that
particular way?  What if they were to read this online and somehow link it
to your real name?
Whatever it takes, of course.  But in practice, there are minimising techniques that will tend to reduce
the requirement of paying off every pig in the continental US of A.  For
instance, if you have the means you might choose to establish a culture of
privilage and exclusivity (perhaps via allocating scarce 'access') among
the pig population in which the payoffs are only given to pigs who
demonstrate loyalty to your drug empire over time.  Various selection
criterion would apply:  don't ask, don't tell; not too greedy; length of
service; consistent and courteous attitude.  Rookie pigs would have a file
opened, and their service record updated each time they interact with your
drug cartel's employees.  After some arbitrary period, or after the
accumulation of enough 'points', pigs would start receiving cash payoffs
and perhaps other perqs.
As you might imagine, there would need be a detailed and sophisticated
system described in order to make for a complete system, and I do not
propose to make an exhaustive list of requirements here.  I simply think
that it could be done if your organisation was sufficiently competent.
I confess that I don't really understand the obsessive preoccupation you
people have with firearms.  They have their place, of course, as everyone
understands the occasional necessity of a well-placed load of number-four
buckshot (to the knees, usually), but guns are above all else, a tool. And they aren't the only tool in the arsenel.
