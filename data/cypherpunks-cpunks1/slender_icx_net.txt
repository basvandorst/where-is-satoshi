Hi! I am writing to tell you about an amazing service that could change your life.  Have you ever forgotten an important date or special occasion?  The Lifetime Reminder Service could be the answer to all of your problems!  We will send you a postcard one week prior to every date you need to be reminded of, FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!!.  We can also send people gift pacs for you automatically.  These gift pacs are perfect for any occasion.  You can take advantage of the Lifetime Reminder Service's benifits for a one time fee of only $39.00.  But for a limited time I am selling the membership for only $30.00(while supplies last).  That is a one time fee and you will be a member for the rest of your life!!!  If you are interested in ordering please reply via email, or you can check out my name is Eddie Loveday, if you have any questions please feel free to email me at slender at icx.net.   I accept C.O.D. orders. To order please email me with your addresse, name, and telephone number.
I appreciate you taking the time to read this.
