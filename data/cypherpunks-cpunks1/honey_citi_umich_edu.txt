the following remarks were transcribed from today's live satellite
broadcast from sun on object oriented technologies, hosted by john
gage.  in his introductory remarks, he said:
    I found something else that a number of you probably have read already,
    it's in a way relevant to this, about searching through large archives.
    This is John Gilmore, Sun employee number five.
    [Holding up to the camera last Saturday's NYT article.]
    This is John in his normal confrontational stance with the National
    Security Agency.
    John wanted two textbooks on cryptanalysis that were classified, then
    declassified briefly, then reclassified.
    Using good search techniques, using what Bob Kahn would call "knowledge
    robots" or "knowbots", objects searching for your bibliographic material
    on the net, John found them in a public library and that made the NSA
    very upset.
    For about three days there was a fight, this was in Saturday's New York
    Times, there was a fight until Tuesday of this week, yesterday, they
    declassified these books.
    So using object technology in some rough sense to pore through enormous
    amounts of information is a topic that may sound futuristic but it's
    very, very real, we think, and we'll talk about that.

@_subject: Destroying Data (Re: Remailer Policies) 
not quite.  you need something like
  dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/xxx bs=verybig conv=sync
this will zero out every block on the disk.  but this is overkill --
why not just apply this technique to the individual logs, zeroing
out their data blocks?
ps:  is it certain that zeroing out the data blocks thoroughly destroys
the data?  i've heard that a "shadow" of some sort may remain.

@_subject: Destroying Data (Re: Remailer Policies) 
clri destroys the file "handle" (the inode, thus the owner, mode,
length, pointers to data blocks, etc.) but not the contents of the
data blocks.  stringing them together is another story, but not
impossible if you know what you're looking for.
u.w.o.o. often go to great lengths to avoid writing a few lines of c,
which, i suppose, is not so bad. but i agree with hkhenson that the best way to secure the remailer logs
is to encrypt them.
which raises a sticky point, since i don't see an easy way to do that
on a machine that you can't secure physically.
i'm familiar with the andrew environment (e.g., afs or the andrew
toolkit), which is more or less a kerberos environment, wherein secure
service providers run on physically secure machines.  this lets
sysadmins store cleartext passwords (in essence) on their local disks
to support reauthentication daemons (to refresh tokens for long-lived
jobs, since kerberos tickets time out).
this clearly would not achieve the objectives here.  the only option i
see is to enter a password at boot time (or when the remailer is started).

@_subject: Security Dynamics 
if this is the phys. rev. let. paper by ferenburg et al., there's a
postscript copy up for ftp in csp2.csp.uga.edu:/pub/documents/amf1/. i can summarize.
their simulations were based on five to ten runs, with 10^7 updates
per run.  they aren't precise about the exact number of random
numbers needed, at least not in this paper, but i assume it's in the
order of one per update, in which case 10,000 would not be enough.
more info can be gleaned from the paper in /pub/documents/adler3/.
they compared four basic rngs.
a linear congruential algorithm (cong)
two different shift register algorithms (sr250 and sr1279)
a subtract with carry generator algorithm (swc)
a combined swc-Weyl generator (swcw)
the authors report that the tables were initialized with some care
(i.e., with cong).  the result reported in the phys rev let paper is that r250 gave results
that were way off (the model being simulated has an exact solution),
swc was better, but had error in the opposite direction, swcw was
better but still showed signs of bias, and cong was within error limits.
they also report that r1279 was much better than r250, but the tables
are missing from the paper, so ...
on the other hand, using every fifth value from r250 gave results
within error limits.  same with swc.  odd ...
maybe someone can comment on the particular rngs being tested here.
they don't look particularly sophisticated to me, although the authors
describe them as "ostensibly high quality rngs."  hmmm ...
looking over thir recent pubs, it doesn't look like this group (of
statistical physicists) is following up on the rng testing angle.

@_subject: saltzer and schroeder on information protection 
this is taken from a paper i'm writing with avi rubin.  it's not a sound bite, more like a snack.
Experts dismiss systems that hide cryptographic algorithms or protocols
(a.k.a. "security through obscurity").  Kahn [1] cites Kerckhoffs'
classic treatise on military security [2].  Saltzer and Schroeder [3]
reflect the modern view in describing "open design" as one of the
basic principles of information protection:
   The design should not be secret.  The mechanisms should not depend
   on the ignorance of potential attackers, but rather on the
   possession of specific, more easily protected, keys or passwords.
   This decoupling of protection mechanisms from protection keys
   permits the mechanisms to be examined by many reviewers without
   concern that the review may itself compromise the safeguards.  In
   addition, any skeptical user may be allowed to convince himself that
   the system he is about to use is adequate for his purpose.  Finally,
   it is simply not realistic to attempt to maintain secrecy for any
   system which receives wide distribution.

@_subject: Clipper letter 
here is the letter i sent my senators and representative, w/ a
copy to clinton and gore.  don't forget to write yours.
I'm writing to share my concern about the White House announcement of
April 16, 1993, which provides for wiretap ability in telecommunica-
tions networks and wireless communications links.  The particulars of
the announcement are not in and of themselves altogether alarming, but
the implication is that this is just a foot in the door:
    Q:  If the Administration were unable to find a technological
    A:  This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered
        during the broad policy review.
Thanks to the widespread use of software that provides for information
protection and privacy, the most common "powerful encryption device" is
the personal computer.  The suggestion that computers and software in
everyday use be declared contraband worries me.  But at a more fundamental
level, I am concerned about the right to privacy.
Privacy in the modern day means information privacy: keeping to oneself
computerized data about oneself.  Because encryption is widely regarded
by computer security experts as the only effective means of ensuring
computer privacy, the White House's "broad policy review" promises to
examine whether citizens should have the right to determine whether and
how to provide for their own privacy.
Your voice is needed in this debate.  I hope that when the question is
raised whether the government should hold exclusive rights to the
protection of individual privacy, or whether the people should hold
that right to themselves, you will stand on the side of the people.

in a classic tirade, greg broiles' rants with fever and pitch, comparing
the government's threat to make cryptoprivacy tools contraband and pkp's
very real attempts to do exactly that.
you know what?  i agree completely.
i don't plan to stop using pgp.  if pkp wants to be reasonable, we can
make a deal.  in the meantime, my interest in pgp is research with
no commercial significance.  patent courts have long recognized the
validity of experimental use of patented inventions by such researchers.
don't believe me?  see rebecca s. eisenberg, "patents and the progress
of science:  exclusive  rights and experimental use," university of
chicago law review, Vol.  56(3),  pp. 1017-1086 (summer 1989). i suggest cypherpunks should make accommodation with pkp and the patent
office by renouncing commercial exploitation of pgp, and embracing
pgp as a foundation for building and understanding cryptoprivacy tools.
that is to say, we blow them off.

huh?!?  my file transfer times would *double* if i turned off v.42bis
(modem compression).  *that* would slow me down.  and you can't run
v.42bis without running the error handling protocol (v.42), for obvious
reasons.  what's more, v.42 gives an immediate 20% (or so) increase in
throughput, by eliminating start and stop bits.
arguably, i could (and should) be running compression in my slip or ppp
driver, but certainly it is false to say that v.42bis and v.42 slow me
down -- the opposite is true.
i don't much care about round-trip times, as i use my slip line principally
for afs, which runs as a data stream.  round-trip delays are amortized over
file transfers.
phil karn's points about modem buffering interfering with type-of-service
queueing are the strongest condemnations of modern modems, in my view.

the remailer of my dreams would offer ironclad guarantees of
anonymity.  call me a cynic, but asking me to place my trust in the
hands of ...  well, just about anybody! leaves me cold.
i recognize that social issues will surely arise, but society has
managed to deal with anonymity in other contexts.  for example, i
can send postal mail with high confidence of anonymity, and can make
anonymous phone calls (with care, e.g., by using phone booths and
moving around).
something tells me that the difference here is that we are getting

can send anonymous mail, just like you can communicate anonymously with
other media (if you are careful).  remailers institutionalize anonymity,
nothing more.
if your point is that dishonesty makes privacy necessary, i agree.

not the algorithm, which was public from the start, but the rationale behind
the selection of its parameters.
the rationale remains classified; some people question nsa's motivation
in keeping that aspect of des secret.  i believe nsa keeps it secret to
avoid teaching potential (or imaginary) adversaries advanced cryptographic
techniques.   (and also because keeping secrets is what nsa is all about.
they seem to be very, very good at it.)
you mean 112 -> 56.  this has been resolved -- it seems that longer keys
don't impose any additional complexity on des attacks.  although these
attacks were discovered by the open crypto community only a few years ago,
nsa had these techniques in hand long before.  the bottom line is that
additional key bits would not make des more secure.  double des or triple
des do.
it has long been believed that a dedicated des-cracker is within the budget
of extremely well financed organizations.  your story is pretty close to the spin i'm familiar with.

        GAO Criticizes ARPA on Architecture Research
The General Accounting Office released a report in May (GAO/IMTEC-
93-24), criticizing the DoD's Advanced Research Projects Agency for
its handling of the High Performance Computers and Communications
Some researchers have criticized ARPA for procuring only Intel and Thinking Machines supercomputers for use by ARPA projects, while ignoring machines manufactured by other companies.. GAO cleared ARPA of the harsher accusations of serious misconduct, but upheld this general criticism, saying that such a narrow focus has inhibited R&D by
other supercomputer manufacturers.
The report suggested that ARPA should seek advice from a broader
range of researchers who do not directly participate in ARPA
projects. Finally, GAO said ARPA needs to give more emphasis to software development, which in the past has been given lower priority than hardware.
ARPA claims it has already fixed many of these problems..
GAO is now planning a follow-on study looking more broadly at program management and support for high performance architecture research in all         House Appropriations Subcom Gives NSF an 11% Increase
        "Clipper Chip" Proposal Draws Public Criticism
The Clinton Administration's recent proposal to implement the Clipper chip as a government encryption standard is receiving a cold welcome from some in the computer community.
During a three-day meeting before the Computer System Security
and Privacy Advisory Board of the National Institute of Standards
and Technology, dozens of people from academia, industry, and civil
liberties groups expressed disapproval for the way the White House is trying to implement its cryptographic policies. Complaints were directed in three directions---to the technology, to the process of selecting the standard, and to the civil liberties implications for Federal wiretapping.
The Administration initiated a public review after, rather than before, declaring Clipper as a government standard and ordering thousands of Clipper devices for government use.
In light of the negative reaction, the advisory board passed a resolution to extend public review and voted to hold another board meeting in late July. The board also decided to send a letter to the White House to relay public concerns and to suggest tactfully that the president reconsider the Clipper         Amendments to HPCC Act Move Forward

Geer Zolot White Paper: Clipper Initiative
On April 16, 1993, the U.S. Government issued a "Public Encryption Management" directive, requesting that communications vendors install into their products chips that implement a secret algorithm with controversial key-escrow facilities. These chips (called "Clipper" and "Capstone") stem from work by the NSA (National Security Agency) and its contractors; they implement the SKIPJACK algorithm, which is classified SECRET and is therefore not available for public review. For more information on the initiative, consult the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Computer Security BBS at 301.948.5717 or via Internet ftp to csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in the /pub/nistnews The Government states that one motivation for this initiative is to allow authorized wiretapping of encrypted communications by escrowing the keys corresponding to individual components. A pair of "entities" (choices not announced) will have responsibility for keeping keys secure and releasing them only to government officials who have received legal authorization to perform a wiretap.
The Government recommends use of the chips instead of already existing cryptographic algorithms, such as the secret-key DES algorithm (a Federal Information Processing Standard and the basis of Kerberos and other network security tools) and the public-key RSA algorithm. Since DES and RSA have been subject to public scrutiny, experts have tested and confirmed their strength, which has led to their adoption within internationally-agreed networking standards; since SKIPJACK is secret and can never receive this scrutiny, it is unlikely that it will ever have such acceptance. Further, DES and RSA can run in both hardware and software, which satisfies performance and system integration requirements; the Government has limited Clipper/Capstone to hardware, which restricts the range of systems that may use it.
For now, the Government is recommending that equipment vendors use the chips on a voluntary basis; however, some observers regard the initiative as an attempt to establish a precedent that could later lead to governmental restrictions on the availability and use of open cryptographic systems. This could limit innovation in cryptographic technology. Further, user organizations could lose control over protecting and managing the keys on which their security depends. This summer, the Government plans inter-agency discussions of future policies in this area; observers have noted that policy development should also reflect private sector interests. Concerns about personal privacy raise additional controversy. Significant debate on these topics is likely in upcoming months.
Geer Zolot Associates believes that availability of open and exportable cryptography serves our clients' interests. Because of this, we are concerned about the implications of the "Public Encryption Management" initiative, and of its possible chilling effect on development, availability, and use of cryptographic technology. The initiative raises many issues, including:
      o	If the Government mandates enclosing cryptography in hardware modules,       o	Introducing a requirement for procurement, integration, and use of       o	If flaws in the hardware-implemented Clipper/Capstone cryptographic       o	It appears that gaining access to a Clipper/Capstone chip's escrowed       o	It appears unlikely that international telecommunications users and We invite and encourage you to consider the Government initiative, including its impact on your organizations and distributed system security plans, and that you submit comments to your representatives.

If you wish to share any of your comments or observations with us, we would welcome them. Further, we are happy to serve as an organizer for assembling and coordinating such information.

one way to defeat traffic analysis is to maintain a steady stream of
traffic.  to this end, avi and i are considering a "remailer tax" -- if
you send a message through a remailer, you pay a tax of (say) ten
additional messages sent and ten received.  so if you send a message
via a remailer, your software is obliged to send out an additional ten
nonce messages, spaced out over time.  that's not so onerous ... but
those messages have to *go* somewhere, so you will also be taxed by
receiving ten nonce messages.
this remailer tax is not completely thought out ... what do you
think?  if remailers catch on, the nonce traffic can be cut back.
i'm also still enamored of the probabilistic remailer notion i proposed
a few months ago, where a remailer flips a coin to determine whether to
deliver a message to it's destination or whether to throw it back into
a pool of like remailers.

  If basic research cannot be insulated from the patent system entirely, it

  prior discoveries with the interest of the scientific community in allowing
  subsequent researchers to enjoy free access to such discoveries by exempting
  the use of patented inventions in research from infringement liability.
  While the United States patent statute does not provide for such an
  exemption, the courts have long recognized, at least in principle, that a
  purely "experimental use" of a patented invention, with no commercial
  purpose, should be exempt from infringement liability.
over and over, she reiterates that patent courts have consistently
recognized the experimental use defense.

hal, chaum may be barking up the wrong tree, but that doesn't mean
that his students are.  i read a couple of digital cash papers last
night and was struck by this statement in one of them:
    Techniques have been developed that ... allow the construction of
    off-line electronic cash systems that are secure for the bank, yet
    at the same time honest users of the system are guaranteed to
    remain completely anonymous.  This holds in a very strong sense:
    the security of banks is not compromised even if all users and
    shops collaborate in such an attempt, and the privacy of honest
    users cannot be violated in any cryptanalytic way even under
    adversarial behavior of the bank in coalition with all the shops.
this is very encouraging: digital cash technology is very far advanced,
and offers almost everything you might want.  (i think the jury is
still out on the question of k-spendability.)  but then there is the
bad news:  the mathematics and the protocols underlying the technology
are still too complex to be practical.  but there is also good news:
much of the current work intends to simplify the protocols and to
lessen the computational requirements of digital cash systems.

@_subject: Chaum on the good foot? 
well, actually, it's very neat how this works.  here, i'll quote from
n. ferguson's paper  "single term off-line coins."
  The most difficult fraud to counter in electronic cash systems is
  the double-spending.  A user can always spend the same coin in two
  different shops.  This fraud cannot be detected at the time of
  spending as the payments are off-line.  The solution that all
  electronic cash systems use is to detect the double-spending after
  the fact.  At each payment the user is required to release some
  information in response to a challenge from the shop.  One such
  release of information provides no clue to the user's identity, but
  two such releases are sufficient to identify the user uniquely.
this is based on shamir's "how to share a secret" cacm v22n11 1979.
in the stefan brands quote ("the privacy of honest users cannot be
violated in any cryptanalytic way") the emphasis is on honest users.
dishonest users are traceable.
after reading these two papers, i really think off-line cash works -- it
offers divisibility, multi-party security, privacy, and untraceability. the major impediments seem to be the complexity of the protocols and the
large computational price to be paid.

david brin spoke in ann arbor recently at a library science school
alumni meeting.  his talk was titled "Information and the 21st
Century:  Privacy, Wealth and the Newest Threat to Freedom."  here are
my recollections; hopefully they're not too dim or biased.
getting right to the punch line, tNTtF is this:
    privacy laws will be used as a weapon by the Rich and Powerful to
    restrict the free flow of information.
brin feels that privacy laws will be ineffective against the RaP, will
be sold to the rest of us through effective propaganda, and that they
will be used by the RaP as a means to cement their power base.  he
argues that complete and open access to information provides the
greatest social benefit and best serves The American Dream.
asked about clipper, he suggested that key escrow was exactly the sort
of tool that the RaP would use, and that we would all benefit by
banning cryptography.
asked whether private citizens should be barred from insuring personal
electronic privacy, he replied that he felt that such measures would be
ineffective agianst the RaP.  (i concluded from these answers that cryptography is not brin's strong point.)
brin's message was basically a populist one.  he is concerned that the
moguls of data will have the opportunity to control what we see and
hear.  what i found most fascinating about his talk was that while i
generally agree with the social objectives he backs, i am in 180 degree
disagreement on how to accomplish these ends.
ps:  anybody else get the willies (as it were) reading paul goggin's

   3.  alice responds as follows forall 1 <= i <= {k over 2}
       a.  if s sub i = 1, then alice sends bob a sub i, c sub i,
           and y sub i.
       b.  if z sub i = 0, then alice sends bob x sub i, d sub i,
   4.  bob verifies that C is of the proper form and that alice's
       responses fit C.
   5.  bob later sends C and alice's responses to the bank, which
       verifies their correctness and credits his account.
not very illuminating so far ... let's go on.
   the bank must store C, the binary string z sub 1, z sub 2, ... ,
   z sub k and the values a sub i (for z sub i = 1)
   and a sub i xor (u || v) (for z sub i = 0).
gee, what is that "||" operator, anyway?  ah, concatenation.  ok.
going on ...
   if alice uses the same coin C twice, then she has a high
   probablility of being traced: with high probability, two
   different shopkeeprs will send complementary binary values
   for at least one bit z sub i for which B sub i was of the
   proper form.  the bank can easily search its records to
   ensure that C has not been used before.  If alice uses C
   twice, then, with high probability, the bank has both
   a sub i and a sub i xor (u || (v +i)) with high probability.    thus the bank can isolate u and trace the payment to alice's
   account.
hmmm.   hmmm.  well, this is very complicated.  with high probability,
i mean.  i'm going to have to study this paper.
ps:  what are the B sub i you ask?  don't ask.  oh golly, they are
blinded candidates, formed by alice and sent to the bank.  hmmm.
hmmmmmm sup k mod 1/p.

@_subject: second order homophonic substitution 
a faq on this list (and other places) is whether it is possible to
encipher a message in such a way that the resulting ciphertext can be
deciphered into a different (harmless?) message.  i mentioned on
sci.crypt that a second-order homphonic substitution does just this,
but it seems to have been missed by the cpunx readership.  so, just to
prove that i can read denning and still type, here is a brief
explanation.  (not brief enuf, sorry.)
a homophonic substitution maps letters from the plaintext alphabet into
sets of letters from the ciphertext alphabet.  to encipher, you pick an
arbitrary letter from the image of each plaintext letter.  usually the
intent is to disguise single letter frequency statistics.  it's still
not very strong, since it doesn't disguise digram or trigram
statistics.  (also, it seems to me that it would be vulnerable to the
same sort of attack used on running key ciphers.)
need an example?  see denning, p. 70.
to build a second order homophonic substitution cipher, you construct
an n by n table, where n is the size of the plaintext alphabet.  (say n
= 26).  initialize each entry in the table by a unique element from the
ciphertext alphabet.  (say, the integers from 0 to 26 * 26, permuted
arbitrarily.)  this table constitutes the key.
to encipher a message, select a "dummy" message (say the itar regs).
to encipher the i-th plaintext letter, say p sub i, grab the i-th
dummy letter, say d sub i, and output table[d sub i, p sub i].
to decipher, find the ciphertext letter (or number, in this case) in
the table at row i and column j.  to recover the actual message, output
the j-th plaintext alphabet letter.  to recover the dummy message,
output the i-th plaintext alphabet letter.  i.e., the rows give the
dummy message, while the columns give the actual message.
simple stuff.  here's an example.
D	01	02	03	04	05	06	07	08	09
E	10	11	12	13	14	15	16	17	18
G	19	20	21	22	23	24	25	26	27
I	28	29	30	31	32	33	34	35	36
N	37	38	39	40	41	42	43	44	45
O	46	47	48	49	50	51	52	53	54
S	55	56	57	58	58	60	61	62	63
T	64	65	66	67	68	69	70	71	72
U	73	74	75	76	77	78	79	80	81
here is some ciphertext: 64 11 05 32 49 77 57.
it's clear how to extend this to n-th order.

Formal Methods for the Analysis of Authentication Protocols
A D. Rubin

Center for Information Technology Integration
University of Michigan

In this paper, we examine current approaches and the state of the art
in the application of formal methods to the analysis of cryptographic
protocols.  We use Meadows' classification of analysis techniques into
four types.
The Type I approach models and verifies a protocol using specification
languages and verification tools not specifically developed for the
analysis of cryptographic protocols.  In the Type II approach, a
protocol designer develops expert systems to create and examine
different scenarios, from which she may draw conclusions about the
security of the protocols being studied.  The Type III approach models
the requirements of a protocol family using logics developed
specifically for the analysis of knowledge and belief.  Finally, the
Type IV approach develops a formal model based on the algebraic
term-rewriting properties of cryptographic systems.
The majority of research and the most interesting results are in the
Type III approach, including reasoning systems such as the BAN logic;
we present these systems and compare their relative merits.  While each
approach has its benefits, no current method is able to provide a
rigorous proof that a protocol is secure.

@_subject: authoritative definition of cryptography? 
according to denning's book, "cryptography is the science and study of secret writing."  webster's 7th says cryptography is "the enciphering and deciphering of messages in secret code."  kahn says "the methods of
cryptography ... render [a secret message] unintelligible to outsiders by various transformations of the plaintext."

a cellular phone that is turned on is in periodic contact with
the local antenna.  certainly the cellular provider knows what
cell a mobile phone is in; that's how calls are directed.  in
fact, anyone can monitor the paging channel to make a primitive
tracking device.  (some folks on this list know much more about
this ... perhaps they'll speak up.)

Abstract: Traditional approaches to introducing commerce to the Internet focus on using the Internet to facilitate the sale of goods and services.  However, these approaches require either encryption or a closed system in order to safeguard payment.  By restricting our focus to information commerce -- transactions not involving physical goods or service -- we can radically simplify the underlying commerce model, with extremely important consequences for the usability and democracy of the Internet's payment infrastructure.
