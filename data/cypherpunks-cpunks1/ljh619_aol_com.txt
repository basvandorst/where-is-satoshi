I sent in the order form with a money order to start working at home for the $3.00 per envelope stuffing.  I have not recieved anything yet, and its been a few weeks.  I'm am assuming that this whole thing is a fraud which I was ready for, but that sucks.  Can you help me out?  I sent it to the Better Solutions address on this website.  I'm not sure if you are the person I need to write to, but your e-mail address is on here, so I am going to write you.  Please get back to me.  Thank you.
                                Leslie.
