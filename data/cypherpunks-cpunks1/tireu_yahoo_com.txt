@_subject: [drone-list] DC Area Drone User Group 
For anyone in the Washington, DC area interested in using or building drones you may want to check out the DC Area Drone User Group at  .  Our organization's mission is to promote the use of flying robots for humanitarian, artistic, and recreational purposes.  We have some events in January to help people who want to build their own low cost drones and we will be running a flight school in February. DC DUG is also going to have some policy events in 2013 so stay tuned if you are interested. I hope to see some of you at our future events.
