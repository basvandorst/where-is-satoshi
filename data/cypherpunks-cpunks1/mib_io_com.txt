If you are running Red Hat Linux and want the Cryptographic File System (also
available for most BSD-derived Unix systems and most current Linux releases),
go to                                If you are running Linux 2.0.X and want the Transparent Cryptographic File
System (improves on Matt Blaze's CFS, they say), go to                                                         - d.
