Kindest attention ,
            REQUEST FOR AN URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP After due deliberation with my colleagues, I have decided to forward
to you this business proposal. We want a reliable person who could
assist us to transfer the sum of Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars ($20,500,000) into his / her account. This fund
resulted from an over-invoiced bill from contracts awarded by us
under the budget allocation to my Ministry and this bill has been
approved for payment by the concerned authorities. The contract has
since been executed, commissioned and the contractor was paid the
actual cost of the contract. We are left with the balance US$20.5M as
part of the over-invoiced amount which we have deliberately over
estimated for our own use. But under our protocol division, civil
servants are forbidden to operate or own foreign accounts. This is
why I am contacting you to be our custodian for this fund. As you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your
address from a site in the internet that portrayed you (your
establishment) in good light. I am the Chief Accountant/Internal
Auditor of the Contract Award Committee (C.A.C.) of the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). This transaction is very much
free from all sorts of RISKS and TROUBLE from my Government. We the
N.N.P.C. Officials involved in this deal have put in many years in
service to this Ministry. We have been exercising patience for this
opportunity for so long and to us, this is a life time opportunity we
cannot afford to miss. You need not to worry about the
responsibilities of transferring this fund into your account, because
all the administrative step needed for the transfer of this fund into
your designated bank account will be done by me. We have agreed to
COMPENSATE you duly if agreement is reached by both of us. My colleague and I will come to your country to arrange for our
share, upon the confirmation from you that the money has been
credited into your nominated bank account. Consequent upon your
acceptance of this proposal, kindly confirm your interest by sending
me a revert email at the email account below (gregody at rediffmail.com &
gregody at maktoob.com)
 Your indication by revert email to me of your sincere and serious
interest will enable me send you the PROCEDURE FOR OPERATION.
NOTE: In the event of your inability to handle this transaction
please inform us so that we can look for another reliable person who
can assist in this respect. It might surprise you why we choose you and trusted you for this
transaction. Yes, we believe that good friends can be discovered and
business like this can not be executed without trust. This is why we
have decided to trust you for this transaction. We are looking
forward to doing this transaction with you. Be further informed that
everybodyÂs interest and security had been considered before you were
contacted, so be rest assured and feel free to go into this
transaction with us. But let Honesty and Trust be our watchword
throughout this transaction and your prompt reply will be highly
appreciated. Thank you and God bless.
Best Regards,
DR. GREG  ODILI. NB: If you want to send me an e-mail massage, please use the above
