@_subject: Network security on multiple levels (was Re: NYT covers China 
I did not approach the inline encryption units on purpose. Obviously
anything that leaves .mil land not riding something blessed by DISA is
going to have something like a KG on both ends. Generally Satellite
systems use TRANSEC, though in our line of work it's an extremely
expensive add-on to an otherwise decent security implementation. I'm not
saying it can NEVER be owned, I'm just saying that 90% of the l33t hax0rs
who are going to look to own something are doing so because it is somehow
exposed to public infrastructure. If I were to put up an SCPC (single
channel per carrier, synonymous to point to point circuits) circuit
between point A and B, the persons looking to intercept my traffic would
need to know quite a bit of information about my signals.. Origination
Point, Destination Point, Modulation, Symbol Rates, Center Frequencies, PN
codes, TRANSEC keys, IP lay out, etc.
You won't hear me talk about how something is absolutely and completely
secure, but you will hear me preach from the rooftops the application of
technology that many people believe is outdated and abandoned. There is a
reason media providers and MSO's still use Satellite to downlink video
signals. The military is still heavily invested in this type of technology
because you are able to completely bypass traditionally used
infrastructure, and Utility companies are jumping on the band wagon as
well. I know of several SCADA (massive power companies) networks that ride
satellite completely for this reason. You can justify the cost and latency
with the security of owning a network that is completely removed from the
usual infrastructure.
