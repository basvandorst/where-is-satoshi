@_subject: I'm asking for more rights, not restrictions (was Re: 
If we accept that the set of "natural rights" is fixed, then by asking for more rights (for yourself), you are in fact arguing for more restrictions (on others). I have long argued that spam is tresspass and theft of service, but I have stopped arguing for legislation because I recognize that it is futile. Your actions against telemarketers are successful because both you and the telemarketer are within the same jurisdiction and tort law exists to support your action.  But try to apply the same tort concept against some Chinese spam generator (or Korean, or Romainian, ad infinitum) and you will quickly see that the global nature of the internet renders regional tort law moot. I keep a loose track of the spam I receive (typically >50/day) and a good 85% originates offshore, even though the benefiting party may be domestic. Enacting tort law will simply drive the remaining 15% offshore, and the benefiting parties will just argue that they have been Joe-jobbed.
The problem is that the present email structure was designed for a more naive time when all parties were trusting and trusted.  The solution *is* a technical one. We must build fences against the tresspassers, but inevitably some will sneak through.  If you want to receive email, you will have to deal with email.
That's freedom, isn't it?

But it's not trivial to roll your own 24/7 monitoring company with the ability to call in the cops.  If the monitoring company is compromised, you're \033653337357 anyway, but without them, all you have is one of those car alarms that everyone ignores.
The multi-layered approach is the way to go.  Your home-rolled layer probably wouldn't be able to call 911 for you, at least not without tipping your hand.  Most places, the police require a formal agreement before they will respond to automated alarms, and some departments simply won't. But it could notify you of an invasion and archive the surveillance videos to a remote site.  At least you'd know you'd been compromised and could take appropriate steps.

@_subject: [cta@hcsin.net: Re: CNN: 'Explores Possibility that Power   
It's not just the reliance on Windows that's scary.  It's the mindset of the industrial controls industry, where the concept of security is percieved as a hassle for the end customer, and therefore something to be avoided.
10 years ago, I was developing a data collection and reporting program for the aircraft industry. The project suffered from creeping featurism, and one of the desired features was adding dialup data exchange, so the collection apps could send their data to a central location via modem.  When I asked how much security was wanted on the dialup port, I was told that none was necessary because no one would ever attack the system, and anyway, the data were not interesting to outside parties.  10 years ago, perhaps that was an understandable position, though certainly naive.  (I still put in a minimal challenge/response layer, if only to discourage the C-64 kids with A few weeks ago, I sat in on a meeting to talk over design of a TCP/IP Ethernet interface for an existing control system.  When I asked what security provisions were envisioned for this interface, I was told that the system was not intended for deployment on publicly routed network segments, so there was no need for any security protocol.
I've just returned from an extensive training seminar on OPC controls technology.  The acronym stands for "OLE for Process Control", and it's a Microsoft-centric technology built on top of DCOM.  Agt the lower end, OPC would let you control a PLC from Excel.  Given the compressed schedule of the course (normally three weeks, it was compressed to two for our class) and my previous experiences, I didn't try to discuss security at all.  But I noticed no authentication layer at all.  Apparently, the security Microsoft natively provides for controlling DCOM traffic is all that such an application has available.  And as far as I can tell, that would be none.
I suppose I do get a bit of entertainment from the looks on the engineers' faces when I bring up threat models and attack scenarios.  Most of them are indifferent.  Some are confused.  Some are annoyed.  And one or two have understood the threat, but told me that I shouldn't talk to corporate about such things because it would make the sales force nervous.
The reactions of sales droids (and even management) has been either dismissive (there is no threat) or hostile (I'm the threat).  The most entertaining episode was back when UPS was first deploying their DIAD electronic clipboard, and I asked what steps were being taken to protect the signature data in transit. (There was no protection at all; the signature data were retained in the clear and could be dumped by any device that knew the protocol. I believe this is still the case.)  That eventually produced a regional manager who visited the small company where I was employed.  He was visibly irritated that anyone would even ask about such things, and answered every threat scenario I presented with "That would never happen!"  He stalked off in a huff after I asked him how he would feel if his digitized signature, obtained legitimately when he received a package, were to appear at the bottom of an incriminating document faxed to his general manager.
Ironically, several of my jobs have included IT duties along with my usual engineering tasks.  Those same sales droids and engineers that scoffed at the need for security in their industrial controls applications came running to me frantically when their workstations became infected with SirCam or Klez.
Security, as Schneier says, is a process.  It's also a mindset, and I think one either has the mindset or he doesn't.  And for those that don't have it, it is *very* difficult to impart.

I understand the limitations of the First, but I wasn't exactly joking.  And while I agree that the First cannot be said to imply such obligations, it seems to me that, on the surface, it would not preclude them, either.  "Obligation to read" does not directly infringe upon the right to free speech.  A deeper examination would probably show that it would infringe on the implied "right to be left alone" that is usually referred to as the "right" to privacy, but I don't think that would be enough to prevent such a law from being enacted.  One would hope that it would be thrown out after an appeal reached the proper altitude.  But until a properly deep-pocketed party could pursue it that far, many of the more shallow-pocketed would suffer.

Quoting Tyler Durden :
You say that as though it hasn't been considered.
It doesn't, actually.  There is no clear and compelling reason to make a
passport remotely readable, considering that a Customs agent still has to
visually review the document.  And if the agent has to look at it, s/he can
certainly run it through a contact-based reader in much the same way the
current design's submerged magnetic strip is read.
This story says the data will be encrypted, but the key will be printed on the
passport itself in a machine-readable format.  Once again, this requires manual
handling of the passport, so there's *still* no advantage to RFID in the
official use case.
Yup. Bruce Schneier nailed the real motivation almost a year ago:
Interestingly, even the on-document keying scheme doesn't address the
fundamental problem. Nowhere is it said that the whole of the remotely readable
data will be encrypted. If a GUID is left in the clear, the passport is readily
usable as a taggant by anyone privy to the GUID->meatspace map.  Without access
to the map, the tag still identifies its carrier as a U.S passport holder. Integrating this aspect into munitions is left as an exercise for the reader.
This isn't about phishing. That's just a bonus.

A non-good idea, as it goes against what Tor is all about.
The problem to be overcome here really has nothing to do with Tor, as such.
So Wikipedia understands that the transport layer isn't to blame, yet they
persist in asking for changes in the Tor transport to address the problem of
malicious users?  *groan*
That's not the perception they need to change.  They need to realize that if an
avenue for action without responsibility exists, someone will use it.  Wikis
get defaced all the time *without* AOL or Tor, because the philosophy allows
anyone to edit.  It is that philosophy that is in error, not the transport
layers used by the vandals.  Wiki, as someone mentioned to me in a private

No, the transport layer is not to blame.  The malicious users are to blame.  The
subset of Tor users abusing Wikipedia may be "almost universally bad", but that
is still a subset, and doesn't indight Tor itself.
What I'm saying is that Tor is designed to provide anonymity, and does this
fairly well.  That anonymity is at odds with the social contract where it
provides an avenue for malicious action without responsibility, but that fact
is not the fault of the anonymity or its enablers; it is the fault of the bad
I'm not saying openness is wrong.  I'm saying it has its costs, which you
obviously already recognize, and reducing those costs may require embracing a
less-than-fully-open philosophy.
That modification may include blocking Tor exit nodes, based on the behavior of
bad actors.  That's unfortunate, but expedient.  But trying to force-fit
pseudonymity on the Tor anonymity model is an attempt to shift your costs onto
That Tor is working as designed, and that the problem with bad actors using its
cloak is a problem with the actors themselves.
As Bob Hettinga noted elsewhere, "perfect pseudonymity *is* perfect anonymity".
Arguably, perfect pseudonymity is a more useful construct, but it is a much
harder problem than anonymity.  And given that perfect pseudonyms are perfectly
disposable, that still won't address the bad actor problem completely.  Openness
requires responsibility, and responsibility implies accountability, so the only
"perfect" solution is 100% meatspace correlation to enable enforcement of the
social contract.  That might solve your vandalism problem, but it introduces
other issues.
Those people are not sticking their heads in the sand.  They're correctly noting
that nothing is broken except the bad actors.

Leaving aside the qualitative discussion, let's remember that the freedom to

The problem at hand does not require "authenticated" Tor users.  It requires
authenticated Wikipedia users.
Tor is transport layer.  Authentication for a specific service (such as
Wikipedia) is the responsibility of that service and belongs in the session
An authenticated network and an anonymizing network are mutually exclusive.
No, Wikipedia needs to realize that the IP address correlation they enjoy
outside of Tor is a happy accident, and that they should stop treating IP
addressess as user credentials.  If they want credentials, they need to

If we can also assume that you perform this update over a secure
connection, then (also assuming the secure protocol used is intact) no one
outside of the identity server can see the contents of the session.  The
update protocol should also perform basic protective steps, such as making
all traffic of uniform size, using good-quality randomness for padding and
the like.
Essentially, you *can't* prevent Mallory the Evil Admin from doing 'sudo
cat /dev/kmem > chump_dump.img'.  So you need to tune your threat model
accordingly.  You face two attack surfaces: your connection to the
identity server (which is probably defendable) and the server itself
(which, if we posit local hardware access by Mallory and Co., is toast and
he already knows you are Number 268).
I'd think the method of choice would be to intermediate the update
process.  If updates can be done with an encrypted blob in an email, you
can use the remailer networks and Tor to break the connection between
"you" and "268" so Mallory only knows that someone with the right keys is
updating 268.  Even if direct connections are necessary, a Tor session
should help by making sure that updates to 268 always come from different
IPs. Even if it's only a describable set of exit nodes, all Mallory knows
is that 268 is Tor-literate.
But overall, if you don't trust the admin crew, how do you trust the
server itself?  And should you even be placing your credentials in its
care in the first place?
