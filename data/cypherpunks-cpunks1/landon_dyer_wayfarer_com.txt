@_subject: Why Digital Video Disks are late to market 
i can confirm this.  i recently talked to an employee of a firm [who
i won't name] that was looking for some kind of shrouding scheme to protect
their copy-protection enforcement code, under W95.  [he knows the effort
is ultimately doomed.  he *is* a user of SoftICE, after all... :-) ]
  quotable quotes:
  "we know someone's going to have their scheme cracked.  all we care
   about is that ours isn't the first."
  "i can't tell you the [encryption] algorithm, because that would let
   you break it.  yes, the security is in the algorithm."
  where does hollywood get its crypto?  mattel?

@_subject: future history of remailers 
i just picked up greg bear's new SF novel _Slant_.  it's set in mid-
next-century.  i'm only twenty pages into it, so i can't honestly give
it a recommendation yet, but the following is from one of the "chapter
intro" quotes, and it has some cypherpunk-topical stuff in the author's
'techie gobbledygook' in the 2nd paragraph
  [note: possibly offensive ... but if you're on this list, why am i
   bothering to warn you?  :-) ]
  imagine that, the vatican cracking remailers....
