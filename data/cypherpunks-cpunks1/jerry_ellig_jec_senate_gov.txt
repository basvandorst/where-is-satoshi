@_subject: David Chaum testimony 
I'm a professor from George Mason University on leave to do some work      with the Joint Economic Committee on the economy of the 21st century.       I found your e-mail address attached to some congressional testimony      by David Chaum.  Does anyone know when he testified, and before what      committee?  Being new on Capitol Hill, I haven't yet found the easy      way to find this out from inside the government!
