San Diego Area CPUNKS symposium  Thursday, Sep. 21, 1996.
   Invitation to all Cypherpunks to join the San Diego crowd at "The Mission
Cafe & Coffee Shop".  We discuss cryptography and other related subjects, have
the special cypherpunk dinner, and unwind after a long day at the grind stone.
   Don't forget to bring your public key  fingerprint.  If you can figure out
how to get it on the back of a business card, that would be cool.  If you want
the suspicious crowd there to sign your key, bring two forms of ID.
Hopefully Lance Cottrell will give us an update on Mixmaster and what's going
on at San Diego's best ISP.  You can also get the scoop on why I resigned from
NCR.  It wouldn't of course be because someone freaked out when I forwarded the
cypherpunk e-mail titled "How to become in international Arms trafficker"...
Place: The Mission Cafe & Coffee Shop
       3795 Mission Bl in Mission Beach.
       488-9060
Their Directions:
        (their description, not mine)
They serve stuff to eat, coffee stuff, and beer.
See you there!
New guy, bring your fingerprint.
Drop me a note if you plan to attend... NOTE: My primary e-mail address has changed to use my own domain.  You can reach me at "claborne at cyberthought.com". Permanently replace any other address
that you may have for me.  I am currently not subscribed to the CP list since
my current internet connection is slow (I can't afford anything right now :)

In case you haven't heard....
"AN ALLIANCE OF 11 SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE
COMPANIES HAS JUST ANNOUNCED ITS FORMATION
TO DEVELOP KEY-RECOVERY SOLUTIONS FOR
ELECTRONIC ENCRYPTION, a crucial component of the
Clinton administration's latest plan to loosen the export of
encryption technology.  Announced yesterday, the administration's
plan gives exporters of encryption or encrypted software a two-
year window starting Jan. 1, 1997, to build what the
administration calls 'key recovery' into their products.  [The
alliance will] develop systems that will give the [U.S.] government
what it wants, which is access to suspicious encrypted messages,
so that compliant software companies will be able to get export
licenses for hard-to-crack encryption codes.  . . .
" 'The fact that 56-bit DES [a type of encryption] will be
available from significant sources is going to jump-start electronic
commerce,' said Ken Kay, executive director of the Computer
Systems Policy Project, a public policy group comprised of 12
computer industry CEOs.  . . .  While Gore directly stated
yesterday that domestic use of encryption will remain
unregulated, the double standard for domestic and international
products might discourage U.S. companies from developing two
different versions, leaving U.S. and Canadian customers with the
same products that the federal government has deemed safe to
ship overseas." ["C/Net" Oct. 2; also covered by "Reuter" and
"Dow Jones"]
