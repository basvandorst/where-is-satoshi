well, not sure if Tor has a mechanism to find out who's operating the 'exit' nodes, and the ability to choose a specific exit node.
This way, any govt (or many govts) could put up a bunch of exit nodes

What's worse or funny (depending on your pov) is that some whacky fundamentalist groups have taken this to be the "mark of the beast", and go on about the "fact" that the optimum place for implant is in the hand or the eyebrow. Of course, exaggerated rumours about whole prison populations being under trial experiments and some rich folk doing this for their 'protection' add to the hysteria.

hmm, a couple of weeks ago, i did a traceroute of my packets while running a tor client.  It was 'comforting' to know that my isp was courteously operating an exit node...just 1-2 hops away.  Well, i just re-started my tor client and the 'problem' went away...i felt like i was playing the lotto with my tor client.
what's to stop a group of malloric tor routers from communicating out-of-band with each other and with the mallory exit node as an accomplice?
well, users (the humans using the tor client)  have absolutely no idea, where those circuits are being switched through.  unless, users take the time to trace each http request (each of which go through a different circuit)...and also having to do whois queries on each hop.
perhaps a mechanism (maybe a gui console showing each hop, ip and whois query ) for users to monitor the circuits that their tor client has chosen.
This will give users awareness (or the option to exercise that) about the confidentiality of their communications.

@_subject: SPKI Certs Usage 
I've been wondering about the feasibility of using SPKI certs.  I quite like some of the features (delegation) and relative ease of implementation (compared to X.509 certs)...of course, readability of certs could go a long way to helping end-users evaluate for themselves the trustworthiness of the cert. While pgp certs could probably be a good alternative (given the existing user base and infrastructure)....even though lacking in the ability to However, I'm a little wary since at the moment there seem to be just a few sources of info or proponents (even though their arguments seem convincing to me) when it comes to SPKI.
I am also not aware of any products or PKIs that use SPKI certs.  I would really appreciate if someone could refer me to instances of actual usage of SPKI certs.

Thank you for such a frank response, Peter...I read someone's archived post that you should be  a "protected world resource" (?).  I realise I could have emailed you directly about this a while back, but I really wanted to get the opinion of other people unrelated to SPKI It took me a few months to find out how to get on this list (a bit of a convoluted process for me to finally figure out), since I thought this would be the best forum of informed people to get a valid response.
Seems like yours would be the definitive response...but I am kind of hoping for others' opinions as well.
It's a pity if SPKI is not used just because it's not X.509.

Well, once the Supreme Court starts coming up with stuff like this, you know you've been Bush-whacked.

@_subject: Ideas on increasing the significance of tor 
In some countries, I have a problem accessing Tor.
It initially seemed that they do not allow DNS lookups for Tor servers...I cannot see any servers in my network map (using Vidalia). This Network Map in Vidalia is a really nice feature/addition which helps me know the intermediary nodes and the bandwidth.
I then changed to use different DNS servers, this way the problem is sometimes resolved...but this solution seems dependent on the location from which I connect (net cafe, hotel or friend's home)
I'm not totally sure, but it seems that some Tor users are vulnerable to DNS based DOS attacks.
BTW, even Tibetan monks know about Tor (I talked to one recently)

This is not quite the case of terrorists using mobile payments.
It seems to make a convoluted relationship between mobile phones, mobile SIM cards, stored value cards and tracking financial transfers which are quite separate issues.
Eventually, mobile payments should make the source and destination of financial transactions even more traceable. Each mobile handset has a unique hardware serial number (IMEI) which can be identified (traced) by the mobile network. Each SIM card, or phone number, has a unique IMSI number which is also identified (traced) by the mobile network. The use of multiple stored value cards for multiple financial transactions can be traced to the owner and holder of the mobile phone and their monthly network billing account.

Hawala networks already use some form of steganography...manipulating invoices of goods to hide the transfer of money.
"...many hawala transactions (legitimate and illegitimate) are conducted in the context of import/export businesses, the manipulation of invoices, as discussed above, is a very common means of settling accounts after the transactions have been made."
