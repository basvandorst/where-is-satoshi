I'd have to agree with you (Ray) completely about the need for
standards for the voice internet communications software.  I think it would be best to draw up a standard and disseminate
it rather than wait for one to emerge out of a product.  If a standard is designed, it could be designed with portability
and extensions in mind, whereas if something like InternetPhone
became a de-facto standard, it would probably be more difficult to add upon and port to alternate platforms.

Greetings, everyone.  I just discovered this list a few days ago
and have been monitoring since then.  It's pretty interesting.
I'd like to get involved.  I'm very interested in cryptography
and mathematics, but I have very little cryptographic experience.
(hm. Is there a Cypherpunks FAQ?) From the conversation that's
going on, I am led to beleive that Cypherpunks is setting up
a distributed system to break some cryptographic system or factor a large number.  I would expect that a constant net
connection would be a requirement to participate in such an
interesting event.  In any case, I have a 486DX-50 running
Linux and I'm interested and curious and willing to learn
and help in any way I can.

How exactly does that system work?  They can't instantly demagnetize something with a quick tap on a pad, can they? Also,
what are they demagnetizing?  Is it a strip embedded in the spine
of the book, or is it just in a sticker on the outside? For
instance, how do they do it to magazines (or do they? they
go through the process with magazines, too, or is that just
because they don't know better?)?

Where exactly is the r/c circuit?  Is it very small and in
a label?  Book publishers don't put them in, do they?  Also, if the thing gets "burned out" by the magnet in the
pad, what do libraries and such do where materials are
reused?  Just slap on another label thing?  Tobin Fricke, Alias Light Ray         dr261 at cleveland.freenet.edu

Ah.  By address space, you mean a set of possible keys, right?
Is there specific software we use to test this 'address space,'
or do we come up with our own?   It seems that there ought to be a more exotic method other than a brute force attack.  I
don't know much about cryptography, but if there's a way to
get "feedback" as to how "close" a key is to the real key, then
some sort of genetic algorithm could be devised.  Actually, perhaps not, since there are no "genes" envolved, just a big number.  Hm.

    It was partially broken a few years ago, and the results published in
    Cryptologia. I have a xerox in a carton somewhere.     The break was for codes up to 4or 5 digits long, if I recall - this covers
    most of the major timeslots on the main stations. Longer codes
    cover odd timeslots on less popular stations.
    Code which implemented this partial crack was published on the net,
    and the VCR+ people got very upset about it - apparently they make
    money selling the codes to TV Guide and newspapers. It's protected
    as a trade secret, not a patent.
    It used a combination of lookup tables and Huffman codes, and
    included a certain amount of obfuscation to resist cracking.

@_subject: Collection of personal info 
I'm somewhat surprized at how much of an issue this is.   The
federal government prints up nice green paper for us to pay for
things with.  It's annonymous (to a large extent), univerally
accepted (most of the time), fairly untracably (unless you really want to), easily available, doesn't collect interest,
free to use, etc.  No one is forcing anyone to use credit
cards, etc..  Then again, being a kid, I have never bought
anything with anything other than cash on the spot...

I thought that Bruce Schneier (sp?) had a good point at DefCon:
(something like:) "The US Government thinks that there is a type
of criminal smart enough to use encryption and dumb enough to use encryption provided by the US Government..."(lots of applause).
I think that is a good point.  Of course, if all non-escrowed
encryption techniques were made illegal, then the criminals would
just have another broken law under their belt if they used
strong encryption.  After all, an outlaw is an outlaw because
he has broken laws, so what sense does it make to make more
laws for him to break?  Hmph.  Also, semi unrelated: How do the copyright, pornography, and
California Penal Code 502.7 laws fit in with the first

@_subject: Magazine / Goodbye 
Hello, everyone..  I am posting
this to let everyone know that I am starting a semitechnical
magazine titled _The_Carrier_Wave_.  It will be published every
two months to begin with, and hopefully monthly if I receive
enough material.  I am requesting articles, columns, news, bits, etc..  Whenever anything -interesting- happens, I'd
appreciate it if someone could write a long or short blurb
about it and forward it to me.  Events, meetings, tradeshows,
milestones, new algorithms...  Stories about PGP, Clipper,
etc... Use this to get the word out.  If someone could
run a "Cryptography Column" or "CryptoNews" or a Cypherpunks
column, that would be great... If you are interested, please
send me mail at dr261 at cleveland.freenet.edu..  Also note, I
have unsubscribed to Cypherpunks because I will be very
busy lately and an overflowing mailbox is undesirable.

Yes, I'm still working on a magazine, I still need authors! Write
about cryptography and coverups and clipper and whatever else you
find interesting, and write about it!  Become rich and famous! (ahtoughalthough the rich and famous part won't be a result of
writing for TCW...)   I also need reporters to write blurbs about
things that happen.   If interested, mail me privately at dr261 at cleveland.freenet.edu.. not on the list.
