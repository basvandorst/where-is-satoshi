@_subject: There is a God 
On ABC's latenight news program I just saw a story that renewed my faith that there is a God and he is brown.  It seems that the Alabama Milita was able to film a ATF event that was truly horrifing to behold.  Nigger Hunging Licenses and the works.  Well our friends in Alabama gave the tapes to ABC and the story was blown wide open.  Our friends from Alabama in the pursuit of the ATF did the world a great service and completely restored my faith in America.
