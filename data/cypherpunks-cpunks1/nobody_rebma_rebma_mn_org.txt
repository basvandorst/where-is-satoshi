Here's a new look for electronic cash.  Instead of having a bank where
people have accounts, have the "banker" be a money changer.  He
changes Federal Reserve Notes into crypto dollars.  Anybody can send
him dollars, and include an email address and public key, and he will
email them that same amount of electronic cash.  Anybody can email him
electronic cash, and include a snail-mail address, and he will send
them that same amount of U.S. dollars.
You don't have a permanent relationship with him, you just use the
service when you need to change between electronic and paper dollars.
With the Chaum cash that was discussed here a while ago, where you
need to "deposit" it right away when you get it, here's what you could
do instead.  Send it to the money changer, and ask for fresh crypto
cash back.  It's like you combined a "deposit" with an exactly equal
"withdrawal".  What you get back is good cash that you can hold or
spend as needed.  There are no account numbers involved, no demand
deposits, no bank account at all.
Eric Hughes mentioned demand deposits as defining a bank, so maybe
this would be a way around that.

Update on the digital cash project
I am having some problems with the port to MSDOS, mostly due to
implicitly assuming 32-bit integers in a few places.  Probably I won't
get it working until next weekend.
To recap, the program provides Chaum-style digital cash via two
executables, one for the "players" and one for the "banker".  The
banker creates a public key which has a single modulus n and multiple
exponents, the prime numbers starting with 17.  He sends n to the
players and all is ready.
Players withdraw money by running their programs and specifying the
denominations they want to withdraw.  For example, you could withdraw
a 1, two 5's, a 10 and a 20.  This would create a file with 5 entries
to be sent to the bank.  PGP should be used to encrypt and
ascii-encode this file (for privacy) and it should be mailed to the
The banker receives this file and runs his program to RSA-sign the
values in each of the withdrawal-request entries.  This is the
"blinded cash" that Chaum describes.  Again, PGP should be used for
mailing this back to the user.
The player then has to "unblind" the file to make it "real" digital
cash.  This also changes it so that the bank won't recognize it when
it is deposited.  He uses his version of the program to do this,
producing an actual digital money file with the five "digital bills"
in it.
To pay another user, he runs another function to extract the desired
bills from this file.  Suppose he wants to extract a 1 and a 5.  This
leaves a 5, a 10 and a 20 in the original file, and creates a new
digital cash file with a 1 and a 5.  He would then use PGP again to
encrypt this for safety and mail it to the person he wants to pay.
That person can run a "check" function on the incoming digital money
to make sure it has a proper bank signature on it and is not a
forgery.  He would then mail it directly to the bank so that it could
get credited to his account.
The banker runs his program which checks the signatures on the
incoming money, looks in a database file to make sure these bills
haven't been used before, and adds these bills to the database.  (The
database stores 16 bytes per bill.)  He should then record the deposit
and perhaps send a confirmation to the depositor (my program doesn't
get involved with that).
I hope this gives a clearer picture of how the electronic money
program works.  It is a simple implementation but I think many systems
would work similarly.
I appreciated the suggestion to use cash as part of the list
management itself.  Rather than paying people who post, I wonder if it
would be better to make people pay to post.  Many people have
complained about the volume.  :)  Unfortunately, I suspect that this
would involve too much overhead for the mailing list maintainer.
Maybe the thing to do is to just get the software out there and let
people decide what they want to do with it (if anything).  I'm
probably going to take a couple more weeks to clean up the user
interface and get these bugs out, then I'll try sending it someone to
be put on the cypherpunks ftp archive.
It's nice to be able to finally sign these messages!

@_subject: Remailing 
One possible problem is that the final destination must then be
available to every remailer.
Say I construct an appropriate header consisting of nested
encryptions, and I use it to send a letter from
me -> A -> B -> C -> destination
where A, B, C are the remailers I chose.  Say that there are a total
of 10 remailers in the universe that are known.
Here, A knows me and B, B knows A and C, and C knows B and
However, if A chooses a random remailer from [A-J], then it must
somehow make available the final destination to all of the remailers,
since there is a chance that the next hop will be destination.  Now
instead of C knowing the final destination, [A-J] do.
Even if I made C the "final" hop (and it will then forward to
destination), then I have to make C known to all the remailers, where
before only B knew C.
Besides, some people may have set up anonymous remailers that aren't
public or haven't been announced.

Matthew Ghio,
the past week some (all?) of your users have not been getting any mail.

with all this talk about bank card transactions, you remind me that i
did a software project for remote credit card verification a while back.
my part was the interface to the auth network.
anybody curious what's in those transaction messages?

about the credit card transactions.  i was stupid and lost the one reply
that showed interest.  but the data i have is for one network only.
it's TeleMoney, run by Ceridian (used to be Control Data), and there's
no encryption on the transaction at all.
the information would end up pretty long, and i don't want to bomb this
list.  interested people should send me mail instead.  include a pgp
public key.
to get mail to me, use remailer at rebma.mn.org and include the following
at the beginning of your message:

@_subject: Rabin decryption 
How do you do Rabin decryption?
In the Rabin PK system, your modulus is a Blum integer, a number n of
the form p*q, where p and q are primes equal to 3, mod 4.  According to
Schneier, p. 289, encryption is done by C = M^2 mod n.  On the next page,
he gives four possible square roots of C:
M1 = C^((p+1)/4) mod n
M2 = p - C^((p+1)/4) mod n
M3 = C^((q+1)/4) mod n
M4 = q - C^((q+1)/4) mod n
These formulas don't work.  Also, note the "p -" and "q -".  This is
suspicious.  If M^2 is C, then (n-M)^2 is also C.  I suspect M2 and M4
should have "n -" instead.
Try p=7, q=11, n=77.  (p+1)/4 is 2, (q+1)/4 is 3.  Try M=50, so C=36.
M1 = 64; M2 = 20; M3 = 71; M4 = 17.  None of these are the original
M, and none of them is a square root of 36.
Anybody know the right way to do square roots mod a Blum integer?

@_subject: nullWhat's Killing My Remailed Posts? 
[Please  Reply-To: an105 at vox.xs4all.nl  as I am not receiving the group
or list on which this message _hopefully_ appears.  Thanks!]
Though I have been vigorously using the various remailers for a long
time, I am stumped by my sudden inability to get a post to a newsgroup
by any remailed means.  Example:  For a long time I have used the
following boilerplate form with usura at replay.com with flawless results:
Encrypted: PGP
Anon-To: my.anon.address at somewhere.org
Cutmarks: *
Anon-To: mail2news at demon.co.uk
Cutmarks: ___
Latent-Time: +6:00r
Newsgroups: alt.some.group,misc.another.group
My wolverine has nasty furballs...
My wolverine thanks you all for suggestions...
The current status of this is that I get the remailed receipt, but the
message never shows in the group.  Is mail2news at demon.co.uk down?
I tried using the Usura Anon-Post-To: feature, but it fails as well.
I've tried using _other_ remailers with the simple form...
        Anon-To: alt.some.group at comlab.ox.ac.uk
        Anon-To: alt.some.group.usenet at decwrl.dec.com
        Anon-To: alt.some.group at bull.com
I've also tried Request-Remailing-To: with the same address form.  Nada.
I have been unable to make any of the usual remailers get through to the
groups by any means for about three weeks, though evidence shows that
the remailers are certainly getting the messages, as I can send anon
netmail messages - - - the _posts_ just never show.
I periodically suspect that someone somewhere is running a program to
sweep all posts with "remail," "nobody" or "anon" anywhere in the
header. Any thoughts on this...assuming it shows here?
