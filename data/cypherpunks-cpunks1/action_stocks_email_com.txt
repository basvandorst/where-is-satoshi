JUINA MINING CORPORATION
Ticker Symbol: GEMM
JMC OWNS A 49% INTEREST IN THE DIAMOND MINING PROJECT "PROPERTY 1000" LOCATED IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF JUINA IN THE STATE OF MATO GROSSO, BRAZIL. JMC RECENTLY COMPLETED A FINANCING PACKAGE FOR $750,000 WITH THEIR NEW JOINT VENTURE PARTNER.
THE MINERAL RIGHTS CONSIST OF APPROXIMATELY 1000 HECTARES (2471 ACRES), ORIGINALLY ONE OF THREE KEY PROPERTIES CONTROLLED BY DE BEERS IN THE MID 1970'S TO THE MID 1990'S.  THE JUINA REGION IS KNOWN AS THE LARGEST DIAMOND PRODUCING AREA IN JMC AND THEIR JOINT VENTURE PARTNER (EAG) HAVE A PILOT TREATMENT PLANT ON SITE.
JMC HAS DELINEATED A RESOURCE OF ABOUT 1,000,000 CUBIC METERS OF SLOPE AND TERRACE GRAVELS WHILE CONDUCTING AN AUGERING AND PITTING PROGRAM IN 1998 AND 1999.  THIS WORK WAS CONDUCTED ON APPROXIMATELY 20% OF THE PROPERTY. JMC CARRIED OUT A MAGNETIC GROUND SURVEY, WHICH REVEALED 4 DISTINCT ANOMALIES THAT HAVE A KIMBERLITE SIGNATURE.
ANOMALY K3 WAS PITTED AND A "MASSA" WAS DISCOVERED WHICH APPEARS TO BE A WEATHERED KIMBERLITIC MATERIAL.  THE PIT YIELDED 1005 CARATS OF DIAMONDS.
THE PROPERTY 1000 IS KNOWN TO CONTAIN MANY HIGH VALUE PINK DIAMONDS. RECENT SITE VISIT IN DECEMBER 2000 BY THE SENIOR GEOLOGIST FOR EAG WITH 40 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING CHIEF OF NUMEROUS EXPLORATION PROJECTS FOR DE BEERS STATED THAT, "WHEREEVER HE WENT ON THE PROPERTY, IT WAS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR ALL THE DIAMONDIFEROUS GRAVELS, AS EVIDENCED FROM GARIMPERO AREAS (LOCAL ARTISAN MINERS), ACTIVITIES, AND WASHING SITES ARE LACED WITH LARGE QUANTITIES OF KIMBERLITIC HEAVY SATELITE OR ACCOMPANYING MINERALS". THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED WERE THAT THE PROSPECTS REGARDING A COMMERCIAL ALLUVIAL, ELUVIAL, AND COLLUVIAL VENTURE ON THE CLAIM 1000 ARE EXTREMELY POSITIVE AND PERHAPS BETTER THEN PROBABLE.  "THE ALLUVIAL DEPOSITS ARE TIED CLOSELY TO KIMBERLITIC SOURCES AS EVIDENCED BY LARGE AMOUNTS OF KIMBERLITIC ILMENITE PRESENT IN THE CONCENTRATES.  THE AMOUNTS SEEN GO WELL BEYOND ALL MY EARLIER EXPERIENCES ON THE SUBJECT".   A PAYABLE PRODUCTION FROM KIMBERLITE APPEARS TO BE BETTER IN THE JUINA AREA IN GENERAL, AND ON THE PROPERTY 1000 IN PARTICULAR THEN THEY ARE FOR THE OTHER DIAMONDIFEROUS AREAS OF BRAZIL. A TEAM OF GEOLOGIST AND TECHNICIANS WILL ARRIVE IN JUINA THE WEEK OF JANUARY 21ST TO COMMENCE WORK.
