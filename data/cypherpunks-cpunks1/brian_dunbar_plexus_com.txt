I remember the tune (grin).  Ah, childhood.
Would RFID jamming really be effective?  RFID scanners work when the chip passes the scanner - when a pallet passes a door for instance -  at which point the scanner 'knows' that chips Abe, Bill, Charlie passed point Delta.  To get the jammer to work it would have to be run past the scanner - I don't see how an RFID jammer planted in (say) the changing room at Wal-Mart would be an effective DoS?
It's possible I'm ill-informed or just unclear on the concept.
