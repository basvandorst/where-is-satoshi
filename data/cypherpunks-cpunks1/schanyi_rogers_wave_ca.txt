And you call them clueless?!  One thing to keep in mind... the ignorant are usually aware of their ignorance, the stupid, well... And just like the clueless ones who fall for "Good Times" memos, you've fallen for some misinformation yourself. Single clicks in MS Internet Mail allow you to view the contents in the preview window - without opening or executing any attachments, while double clicking opens the message in it's own window - again without opening or executing any attachments. Try it a couple of times and you'll see for yourself. Just because you "heard it on the internet" does not make it fact!
What an absolutely horrifying thought!!
To the former I suggest you change surreal to unreal, and as for the latter - you might consider taking your own advice.
