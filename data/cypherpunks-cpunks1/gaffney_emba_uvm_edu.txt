A paraphase of Bill Gates in 1981:
"640K ought to be enough for anybody."
However, DRAM technology and use can't really be compared to the fundamental
mathematical problem posed by factoring prime composites. Stuffing more
gates on a chunk of silicon is just an engineering problem. Correct me
if I'm wrong, but I don't think much has happened with primes since
Legendre (1752-1833). Don Gaffney

@_subject: S.652 (H.R. 1555) 
I'm not a lawyer, but from what I've read from the WWW site above, it
seems that only providing "indecent" materials to minors is prohibited.
I think this is already illegal.
Broadcasting or sending unsolicited "indecent" materials is also prohibited, but that seems to have always been the case (except that objectionable materials have been called "obscence" rather than "indecent").
There are provisions, as I read it, that protect electronic intermediaries from the acts of the actual publishers of the materials (i.e. an ISP is not responsible for the material of other internet sites
not under their control).
It sounds to me like the only real task posed is to authenticate those
accessing questionable materials as being >= 18 years old. Hmmmm. Don't
authentication & crypto go hand-in-hand?
Anyway, being rather foolish I suppose, I don't exactly see what the big
deal is - am I missing something???

@_subject: A WfW security curiosity (possibly another security hole) 
This is the file used by admincfg.exe (on WFW3.11 disk 8). This file
contains "security" settings, such as whether or not to cache passwords
on disk (*.PWL files). There is no feature in WFW to prevent use of one copy on multiple
machines on a lan.
In terms of security, yes, the whole of Windows Networking is a bad joke.
(An interesting aside, it is possible to get a WfW "security" error
on start-up by having subst drives - weird, eh?)
