*Bzzzzt* Wrong answer, thank you for playing.  The public access bbs
system running out of Chapel Hill, automatically appends the same signature
to all outgoing messages, and other sites are considering the same measures.

Evidently I mis-interpreted his exact meaning in his statement, but if I
remember correctly, wasn't one of the original mail messages along this line
stating that any mail system which included a signature or identification
automatically was broken?  The point being is this is a common example
of how this is used, and that if an anonymous poster comes from such a site,
his sig would close the search area greatly if not removed.  So this
appears to me to be a good point in favor of signature stripping.
