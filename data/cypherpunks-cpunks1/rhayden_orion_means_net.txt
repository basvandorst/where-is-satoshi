WASHINGTON (AP) - In a rare moment of openness bordering on glibness, a
senior official at the super-secret National Security Agency was overheard
at a White House press conference concerning current bans on the export of
encryption technology saying, "It would not take any twelve times the age of
the universe to decrypt a 128-bit message.  Thirty-three minutes is more
like it."
Observers at the press conference indicated that the senior official's
remarks were intended to be overheard by those standing nearby, who included
White House officials, reporters, and a troupe of girl scouts from Lundane,

An amendment that allowed lyching-without-trial would make it legal.

FYI:  I was only passing along information whcen I forwarded the original
message from fight-censorship. Contrary to the hate mail I'm getting, I am not an NSA spook nor am I an
agent for some other TLA.
Please knock off the mailbombs, it's rather childish and tackey.

MCI RELEASES FREE DENIAL OF SERVICE TRACKER SECURITY TOOL
MCI has released an interesting piece of software called the Denial of
Service Tracker (DoS). The security program helps track the source of
denial of service attacks, which aim to overload a target computer system
to the point that it's unusable for anything else. According to MCU, the
DoS Tracker works against SYN, ICMP flood, bandwidth saturation, and
concentrated source attacks, and is currently being modified to detect
other DoS-based attacks, including a new attack called the Smurf. The info,
a free download, and all the technical information is at the site. A must
have for sysops. Robert Hayden			rhayden at means.net	       UIN: 3937211

@_subject: Compaq / DEC buyout (fwd) 
We have purchased several Alpha based clone computers in the last 4 months
that are all 533MHz machines.  There is also available a 566MHz, a 600MHz,
and an 800MHz, but for our applications the price is prohibitive.
These are clone machines using a DEC Alpha motherboard and CPU.  Very nice
boxes :-)
