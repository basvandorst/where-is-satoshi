@_subject: NYTimes.com Looks at the AIDS Pandemic 
Dear Member,
Two decades have passed since the onslaught of the AIDS epidemic. The quest for the cure continues, but more remains to be done on the prevention front. The New York Times's "AIDS at 20" is an ongoing series that examines this disease in all its aspects, looking closely at patient rights, the vaccine search and public policy, as well the origin of the disease.
I encourage you to take a look at "Voice of the Epidemic" -- six pieces that examine the lives of AIDS patients of all ages, ethnicities and sexual orientations. It reiterates the fact that this disease does not discriminate and all people are This series includes charts, video, in-depth reports from the Kaiser Family Foundation and nearly a thousand articles from the past 20 years. Discuss the ongoing pandemic and its impact on the world in our AIDS at 20 forum.
