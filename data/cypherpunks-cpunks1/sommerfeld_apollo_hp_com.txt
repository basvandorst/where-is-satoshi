@_subject: comments on your recent post of FOIAed documents. 
1) The first document is particularly compelling, especially
considering the apparant references to the censored paragraph in the
un-censored paragraph... it makes it obvious that there are two sets
of reasons for clipper; the ones that they'll admit, and the ones
which are classified and which they won't admit in public.
2) The second document makes it clear that requiring the use of key
escrow is a goal of law enforcement and national security.
3) The dates on the documents are dated after Ms. Denning's infamous
"trial balloon"..
4) From the second document:
Hmm.  It only took me under minute when I tried it (using the command
"archie -s des.tar").  Maybe they tried it when the archie servers
were overloaded :-), or maybe they counted the time needed to read the
archie man page..
5) What kind of a dork uses words like "incentivized"?

@_subject: looking for distributed systems/crypto textbook. 
At work, we're thinking of organizing an internal self-study seminar
on areas related to distributed systems security.
I know of Denning's textbook in the area, but would prefer not to use
it for what should be obvious reasons.
I also know of and have read the "Contemporary Cryptography" book by
Simmons, but it seems to be a little too heavily oriented towards
crypto/math as opposed to applications.
Undoubtedly many of you would have opinions in this area; let me know
what they are and I'll summarize to the list.
