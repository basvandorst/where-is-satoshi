I'd get a about 7 t-shirts too ;)  and I coud probably donate at least 1 80386,
xx% of a 80386, a LITTLE bit of a DEC Alpha or so, probably 1 or 2 808x's and
mayby a 80486, and 2 (if someone ports the code)  C64's! (Wouldn't it be funnie
if thay were the lucky cpu's ?[headlines: DES broken by C64])...  How much for {2,4}000000/sec? $60? I buy $600 worth of parts. :)

By spliting up over this type of network we defente several things:
And we [MIGHT] save the time to have such a thing built.
[ But if we do make the machine, I Wan't it when we're done]
