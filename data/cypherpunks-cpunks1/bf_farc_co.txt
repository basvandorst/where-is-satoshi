@_subject: AIMSTER uses DMCA "no RevEng" against RIAA 
In addition, Aimster is attempting to shield itself behind the very law
the entertainment industry has used to
                go after file-swapping company Napster. The Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a controversial law
                backed by music companies and other large copyright
holders, prohibits anyone from cracking code
                designed to protect copyrights. Aimster, which
incorporated an encryption scheme into a new version
                released Wednesday, hopes that provision applies to it
as well.
                Aimster spokesman Johnny Deep said the new encryption
plan was created to protect the service and its
                members from anyone who wants to monitor the network.
                "The encryption technology makes it a federal crime to
spam or monitor the network," Deep said, adding
                that it could affect record companies. "We didn't do it
to shut them out, but I don't think there will be any
                way to distinguish between" spammers and record labels.

Greene writes in                 Presently, FLUENT can translate Chinese, Korean,
                 Portuguese, Russian, Serbo-Croatian and Ukrainian,
                 Reuters says.
                 The omissions are almost as telling as the languages
                 included. What, no Japanese, no Arabic, no Spanish, no
                 Hebrew, no French? Laotian and Navajo we can
                 understand, but what have we here? Laziness,
                 discrimination, or misplaced trust?
                 You make the call. Â®
Silly lad, you believe the list is complete??
I thought reporters were supposed to think critically.

              FBI bought nearby house to spy on Hanssen
              By Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY
              WASHINGTON Â The FBI secretly bought a house
              near the suburban home of Robert Hanssen just nine
              days after investigators began surveillance of the veteran
              counterintelligence agent now charged with spying for
              Moscow, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday. The
              Vienna, Va., home, just down the block from Hanssen's,
              was purchased under the name of a single woman, Ann
              Manning, who paid $362,500 in cash, according to local
              property records and the realtor who represented the
              sellers. Attempts to reach Manning were unsuccessful.
              The transaction, first reported on "Dateline NBC," was
              made final on Dec. 21.
