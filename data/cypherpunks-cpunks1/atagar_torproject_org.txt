@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor in Google Summer of Code 2013 
Interested in coding on Tor and getting paid for it by Google? If you
are a student, we have good news for you: We have been accepted as a
mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code 2013!
Here are the facts: The summer of code gives you the opportunity to
work on your own Tor-related coding project with one of the Tor
developers as your mentor. You can apply for a coding project related
to Tor itself or to one of its many supplemental projects...
Your mentor will help you when you're stuck with your project and
guide you in becoming part of the Tor community. Google pays you 5,000
USD for the three months of your project, so that you can focus on
coding and don't have to worry about how to pay your bills.
Did we catch your attention? These are your next steps: Go look at the
Google Summer of Code FAQ [1] to make sure you are eligible to
participate. Have a look at our ideas list [2] to see if one of those
projects matches your interests. If there is no project on that list
that you'd want to work on, read the documentation on our website [3]
and make up your own project idea! Come to  on OFTC [4] and
let us know about your project idea. Communication is essential to
success in the summer of code, and we're unlikely to accept students
we haven't heard from before reading their application. So really,
come to the IRC channel and talk to us!
Finally, write down your project idea using our template [5] and
submit your application to Google until May 3, 2013 [6].
We are looking forward to discussing your project idea with you!
