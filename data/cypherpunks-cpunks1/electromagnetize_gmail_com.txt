Kono said superfluorescence is a well-known many-body, or cooperative,
phenomenon in atomic physics. Many-body theory gives physicists a way
to understand how large numbers of interacting particles like
molecules, atoms and electrons behave collectively. Superfluorescence
is one example of how atoms under tight controls collaborate when
triggered by an external source of energy. //...
"The quantum well, as before, consisted of stacked blocks of an indium
gallium arsenide compound separated by barriers of gallium arsenide.
"It's a unique, solid-state environment where many-body effects
completely dominate the dynamics of the system," Kono said.
"When a strong magnetic field is applied, electrons and holes are
fully quantized – that is, constrained in their range of motion—just
like electrons in atoms," he said. "So the essential physics in the
presence of a high magnetic field is quite similar to that in atomic
gases. But as we decrease and eventually eliminate the magnetic field,
we're entering a regime atomic physics cannot access, where continua
of electronic states, or bands, exist." [unquote]

map out the brain via spinning particles in brain for imaging, so a
particular tone will occur and this shifting of direction within
molecules or by particles themselves can be discerned, via
polarization.  cannot drink caffiene without now having similar
effect, as if a remote satellite locked onto noggin, the molecular

so would this not break the physics model already, of faster than light info,
such that the cosmos may operate on principles beyond those employed.
the comments on the article seemingly indicative of this same scenario,
as if a realm of political science, gerrymandering of physics seemingly.
if a spin could be remotely connected to another, as mentioned in the
article comments, and activated at a distance, could this not function
as a basic switch, perhaps making a relay or gate or some kind or the
ability to send/receive coded messages via morse code (as mentioned).
say, a sequence of spins encoding the alphabet or whatever, perhaps
controlled by a normal computer process yet transmitted/received via
this quantum connectivity (seemingly out of this world then back into it
via vibration, rather than a line of sight acoustic signal, if understanding)
i thought that was the idea underneath the potential for other, hidden
technology embedded in existing systems, that remote relationship
via quantum properties that operate in other dimensionality/structures,
if not beyond lightspeed properties or conceptions, and that it may not
be recognizable in the existing approach or computational paradigm.
such that fiber may not be necessary, the approach to key exchange

it also makes me wonder, given the insane speed vs. infinitesimal distance
if *information* could operate as a kind of cognitive pressure on the mind,
(as with predictive Random Event Generator (REG) vs RNG where patterns
organize/emerge out of quantum-noisefield) thus corollary perhaps to the
analogy of water pressure for electrical circuits and flow based on pneuma-
tic dynamics in a potentially bounded or closed system). that may enter
into questions of 'where information actually exists', perhaps stored outside
the brain in noosphere as patterns or forms (invisible constellation/structure)
that is referenced or linked to rather than contained within a brain, and thus
boundary of brain vs. mind. same: digital computer vs.quantum processor,
perhaps. thus issue of channeling or tuning into versus as origin of truth.
what if a fundamentally different data model, thus security model, etc.
this conceptualization has the individual person modeled as an antenna,
tuning into various structures based on what resonates, aligns correctly,
what circuits or feedback loops or environments exist. versus machine

@_subject: EM-nature (was: infra-org) 
i need to make note of this observation because it has special
relevance for the present situation of shared observation regarding
'information operations' (or other) that occur and-or are analyzed
within a particular context, framework, conceptualization. because
there is a split in worldview and modeling between the animal realm
whereby the sonar of bats or directional navigation of birds become
detached in their EM abilities from similar non-recognized natural
abilities in humans, which are 'off the map' so to speak, in terms
of a general awareness and recognition of similar EM physiology.
in other words, 'the senses' of humans are detached from their
electromagnetic context that would unify a model of humanity
(to be discussed at some later time) with such EM nature and
provide context for both a healthy relation and toxic conditions.
though this remains unrecognized via a political agenda that
prevents such data beyond its protected ideological boundary,
thus effects of wi-fi or artificial radiation (radio, etc) on human
beings is categorized into a realm of personal 'mental illness'
and unrelated to issues of cancer, at the same time EM tools
(nuclear resonance) are used to treat the ~mystery disease.
it is a split between mind-body that is enforced institutionally,
disallowing EM viewpoint while leveraging its onesidedness
against dumbed-down populations, unable to reason within
the warped frameworks about what is going on, because the
cause and effect have been separated, plausibly denied. in a
context of 'information operations' and 'electronic warfare' this
involves a realm of ~supernatural-like events that thus cannot
be accounted for in a non-electromagnetic context or view,
such that it cannot be 'rationally' reasoned with beyond a
realm of forced hysteria, as if dealing with ghosts/demons,
versus technological infrastructure operating in other realms.
thus security, defense, attacks are in a realm of "beliefs"
that are detached from a shared understanding/knowledge
of the environment these events are operating/occurring within,
like magic or witchcraft or sorcery, exfiltrating data and then
using a god-status to manipulate peoples lives - now this is
the power of government that is beyond oversight, law itself.
entire realms of ideological attackers then can be aligned in
such a ~wildwest scenario as if a replay of cowboys/indians,
the model for basic exchange moves towards highway robbery
in this same approach, detached from the actual condition that
exists, unable to speak about it or confirm it, as with physics
that supposedly "define" reality at the material level yet which
are byzantine and disconnected views that disallow reasoning
and observation while seeking to represent, have control over it
as ideology - this massive obfuscation the success of relativism.
so that nothing and only nothing can be discussed and the left
is rest for experts. in this way, silence is enforced via ideology
that is actually _detached from nature yet claims to represent it
and so to the mind and imagination and body of humans, these
as they are detached from the environment they exist within as
this becomes the basis for exploitation, predator/prey relations
at the level of politics of the rogue state, homicidal government.
in this way little can be said or done without being discredited
for going 'beyond the lines' that are dutifully enforced by the
protectors and defenders of the corrupt ideology, this boundary
is what needs to stand, the misrepresentation and malmodeling
of existence so that _reason cannot occur in accurate terms,
mathematics (of zero) and michelson-morley experiment (as
if simple debunk of aether) and removal of the absolute from
all equations, then acting and believing as if this is NORMAL
when it is fundamentally unreal as to shared experience and
observation of known and knowable facts and observations.
instead it becomes about what is allowed via a viewpoint
that can remain secure while allowing other views to exist,
within certain parameters yet truth is lost in this confinement
to a finite, overcontrolled, self-interested, skewed interaction,
whereby "nothingness" continually replaces "being" as the
shared condition, while those administering technology can
further apply and ply their craft and trade against and upon
humans, while humans have no effect on this relationship,
it is a bias that is enforced by dark ages restrictions upon
thought, held within an outdated view, stagnation of beliefs
for hundreds if not thousands of years of knowledge (basic
amber and lodestone fundamentals continually extended,
technologized) whereby even the fact that the atmosphere
itself is full of charge is irrelevant to those whose interest
is in technology, as if the 'data model' for information only
exists in artificial media and not within EM nature itself,
that beings could be interacting and formatted the shared
environment like the r/w head of a harddrive via mind, yet
the considerations never go outside the skull or beyond
the 'expert models' that bound this to the brain instead.
as if people cannot be allowed to think for themselves
or perhaps know far more than "beliefs" of scientists
allow via its enforcement of a corrupt political ideology,
where this bias against accurate human representation
that gives rise and momentum to an antihuman agenda,
a religious belief system that is biased against humans
as this is turned into infrastructure, tools, government.
and at its core is nothingness. falsity, lies. not truth.
it is language games. it is disregard for, exploitation
of logic whereby proofs are unneeded, never checked-
beyond language in its ungrounded condition and this
very comprehensiveness is itself based on absolutism,
where 'it cannot be known' becomes this absolute truth
simultaneously denied by the same political priesthood
whose goal is to mislead, misdirect, to keep us enslaved
in a false worldview, model, "physics" detached from reality
the disconnection of accurate understanding of the mind,
as if we cannot be allow to think or know consciousness
even, outside the scientific technological evaluation within
a biased modeling, then forbids accurate connection and
evaluation with the electromagnetic body, nervous system,
senses, in terms of awareness, reasoning, truth itself as
it relates to information (and security) beyond 'the brain',
and all the senses in their variability as they are unified
and not kept separate within human and other entities.
yet this wholeness is illegal as an identity, observation
is forcibly denied, the perspective directly challenges
the technical and ideological and political advantage of
those using these warped harmful tools and exploits
against the population, to continue their illegal control
over events to the deterioration of earth, its inhabitants
when truth is outlawed there is no way to 'reason' about
such conditions. they are penalized as viewpoints and
this defines a boundary condition or protected threshold
of different values, economic/political/social interests
that separate, some mind and bodies benefit for this
while others must suffer as a result of ongoing deception.
for some it is their security model, this obfuscated realm.
for others, humans, it is the basis for insecurity, torment,
disconnection for action and ability, realism, truth itself
thus reality is legislated away by others who stand in
for the law, on their own terms, for their own benefit
while others must suffer for this to be sustained, yet
if some take on more suffering via self-sacrifice, this
condition could be fundamentally transformed, given
rules of operation changed, hacked, short-circuited
and switched into other circuits, functionality, and
then the situation becomes increasing interesting
worldwide, as unified understanding takes control,
governed by shared service to truth, firstly, finally

for instance, if the mathematics of zero is off, then use
of such equations reliant on this modeling are going to
bound observations into a realm of perpetual inaccuracy
as a basis for worldview and 'physics' itself
likewise, if politically expedient, within this boundary,
a model of relativism can continually be reinforced via
these mathematics, it further provides a framework that
declares a particular reality to be the shared situation,
even if this goes against common sense, experience,
truth, and knowledge. physics then determining it as
if judge, jury, ultimately executioner of 'bad thinking'
because it does not conform to the inaccurate model
such as astronomers believing goats ruled earth
from the moon or whatever other such beliefs, if
enforced and stopping other direct observations
because they do not conform to the belief system
much more accurate in a charged atmosphere that
we are beings are _submerged in an information
environment, a realm of invisible circuitry that has
fundamental relation to pattern and constellations
of data, models that repeat as concepts and ideas,
and where do these reside, only inside of brains?
this is why the jellyfish seemed a useful analogy,
a floating sentience suspended in an information
rich environment that then is mediated, tuned into,
related to and through within certain dimensionality
that may change from one being, species to the next
and yet some fundamental condition is also shared,
held in common, this is the electromagnetic context
that is _undocumented in both nature and humans
as a continuous circuit throughout the cosmos from
the beginning of its existence to peak development
of life and sentience unfolding at its very edge, that
is where consciousness is operating, alive, interface
to reality and able to reflect upon this condition
yet without a unified model, EM cosmography
necessary before EM cosmology, seemingly, to
consider EM nature in relation to EM lifeforms,
and then EM humans and EM technology within
this realm, as 'consciousness' and concepts like
code, programming, 'artificial intelligence' are
inherently related to this condition in its truth,
yet completely separated from it due to a non-
electromagnetic worldview, understanding, as
if computers invented and 'contain' charge vs.
everything containing charge in a given realm,
plants, animals, the air, tools, bodies, minds.
the circuit itself not even a concept beyond
the manufactured circuitboard in terms of a
diagrammatic approach to reasoning, that is
processing of reality and decision-making,
such that perhaps this too is about circuits,
and we cannot reason or communciate in
the way we actually think, via patterns as
our worldview is disconnected from them,
from our own observation, and made into
signs instead, held apart from geometry,
other structural relations and evaluations
that may predate or provide foundation
for more ornate descriptions thereafter
yet these fundamentals are not secured
and instead lost in a non-EM evaluation,
as if 'writing to write' or 'coding to code' is
a higher connectivity or awareness when
instead it is a further detachment from the
fundamentals, truth in its logical evaluation
needed to secure the modeling, test and
correct for errors, the obligation ignored,
denied for a simple, quicker lost cause,
moving in the wrong direction, forgetting
to listen to the compass built-into the
self, of the electromagnetic directionality,
its connection with this cosmic condition
and the naturalness and unity, harmony
that could exist with people, environment,
tools, instead ignored, disease, disharmony
and falsity taking the place of enlightenment
then to speak of anything detached from this
condition as if encompassing it in a too small,
finite worldview, believing infinity can be pre-
packaged into a confined condition and then
held there as mode of control over it, versus
freeing the infinity truth and human reasoning,
challenging the concepts and regulations of
'discourse' and 'institutionalization of views',
to achieve this greater accuracy, _security
instead becomes the very problem that must
be combated to defend, uphold the criminal
falsity and deception of a false worldview,
false reality, false perspective, false beliefs
that are normalized, enforced, dictated
in this way what is anything in its truth
without this electromagnetic context as
the foundation for its evaluation, and this
in all its dimensionality, not compartmented
into narrowed controlled categories that are
the basis for its denial via social protocols
that seek to uphold a given social order that
does not serve or seek this greater truth and
instead desires to substitute it, stand-in for it,
as guardians though of the false, nothingness
code, crypto in this context, tools, computers,
programming, reasoning, processing, thought,
security, insecurity, tyranny, freedom, laws
how do you move from infinite parallel worlds
in relativistic conditions into a single shared
empirical framework in varying dimensionality
via quantum conditions without EM-nature?
how do you do this if the mathematics do not
allow it. or an absolute framework is not allowed
within reasoning via the ideology of relativism as
it has been detached from logical accounting
beyond the binary onesided belief of ideology.
what if the model of information survives death,
that like energy, if information is attached to it
as pattern in some way, whether morphic fields
or other conceptual forms or formatting, patterns
that even these computer conversations could
already be occurring interdimensionally, beyond
given thresholds yet not perceived locally this way.
none of it can be rationalized if the foundation for
the worldview is off, wrong, fundamentally incorrect
and there is every indication that this is the case,
yet further, that it purposeful, to maintain control
over events by denying the true nature of reality
and seeking to control and exploit this against
human populations, for their political subjugation
that is driven by evil intent, exampled everywhere
then to communicate or talk in this realm as if
it is not happening, beyond the pale to mention
as if craziness. that is threshold of the different
groundings, the ruling ideology based on falsity
all its circuitry open to hacking and cracking,

restricted to computer coding as the parameters. the examples
given {whistling, baying} seem both in a realm of music/voicing

what has me further curious is if this somehow has linguistics

i am still trying to ground with electromagnetic framework thus
imagining beyond this, as if already grounded, more unknowing
of how to even consider such thoughts or considerations as it
difficult or impossible to separate from the medium involved in
my naive and limited awareness and even less understanding
closest to this perhaps in this not-knowing what might be is
that the cosmos itself is encrypted, as a starting point to

securing truth key to unlocking the works seemingly, OZ writer

wondering if it is actually a blank, then what that implies, or if
parameters exist by which it can be made to unlock access
to new dimensions in which this otherness is more tangible,
maybe a realm exists outside of charge, here not the case

wondering if a distinction could be made in the realm of cryptology as
with other disciplines whereby there is an existing functionality and
then an edge condition of developing ideas where intuitions may be
pursued, tested, learned from.
i see people in various disciplines working on 'ideas' as part of
their work, whereas the same tasks can be pursued in purely
functional, managerial terms likewise, perhaps involving an existing
mode of operation versus evaluating various parameters or potential
in some sense then, as with art, there are artists who have skills and
can develop their work within a given set of parameters, and others
who may be more abstract and involved in this abstraction at the level
of ideas, questioning of existing presumptions. i relate this
condition and pursuit to 'conceptual art', rightly and-or wrongly,
having only an intuitive understanding of what it involves versus art
historical accounts of what it means and how it is identified.
then, so too with music. there are some who perform and develop music
within traditional or known parameters, and others who test or
question the limits though also in a deep realm of ideas. and this
tends towards 'conceptual music' in my sensibility, because more is
involved than what may be discerned from the aesthetics and it may
take more to understand it as it may operate in different parameters
than what is already known, and may need evaluation within a different
sensibility to access what it involves, which may center on grounding
of ideas or conceptions beyond a given interpretation, model, or limit
in standard approaches.
this then relating also to the rich realm of conceptual architecture,
typology seemingly having a unique role in this (ex. architects
Boullée and Ledoux from the enlightenment era when studying ruins and
the discipline of archaeology began, if remembering correctly, moving
into another realm perhaps tending towards the surreal compared to

it is as if 'ideas' and their contemplation was more readily at the
center of questioning, the basis for what is developed, less so than
unquestioned conventions repeated as patterns. and this continued as a
major approach, including Le Corbusier and others, within certain
parameters, though a 'high conceptualization' can be involved in an
activity that in the griops of other practitioners is merely a
functional question that has already proscribed solutions that can be
uniquely or methodically rearranged though perhaps not fundamentally
questioned. so in some sense the fundamentals or basis or foundational
and its basics are secured and relied upon or brought into question
and further tested, experimented with, refined, or moved beyond
perhaps in particular circumstances as a model or approach.
this conceptualization continued into the 1960s (such as Archigram)
into the 1980s though its purpose seemed to be made profane, focused
on the image as a basis for abstraction, and the deeper questions of
architecture ignored for a shallow aesthetic approach that can be
hollow or ungrounded from 'reality' in some significant sense,
detached from issues and people and of a realm of CAD design, as if
architecture is only industrial design, creating pleasing objects or
sculpture devoid of economic, social, political, cultural issues it
involves, its deep meaning and insight, and instead, developing
blindness. this is more anti-architecture, the concept is not about
ideas but about extending an ideology of a particular warped value
system, and so the image is like an illusion of what actual
architecture is, in its greater purpose and mission. not trivial, not
just manufacturing buildings or 'culture' as if a fashion item to be
copied, reproduced as a trend or style, yet that is what it has
devolved to in tersm of its 'ideas', in many or most cases- if just on
its detachment from understanding nature itself and people and serving
these interests instead of designing building as part of a
political-economic flow that aestheticizes an existing and harmful way
of life, yet makes it as enticing as possible. (in this way the
excellent observation of such 'architecture' as pornographic forms, as
introduced by Dr. Elisabeth von Samsonow in The Plasticity of the Real
video lecture.)
i tend to consider this earlier intersection between archeology and
architecture vital for understanding both disciplines in their
interrelated depth, bridging past and future, and asking questions
again in a different context than just a present mode of operation.
thus to question and learn from ruins or evaluate a situation in a
larger context than it may otherwise have due to convention. and it
appears a lot is lost to narrowed conception of processes and existing
functioning that may limit potentials for insight and innovation
beyond the existing boundaries, again due to convention if not
conforming to rules or patterns or models that may already work in the
given constraints or parameters- though these too also change and
transform over time, yet the 'ideas' attached to them do not, and
often approaches can become fixed ideas or conceptions, as if the
world does not change becomes a routine is continued the same, even
while everything is shifting underneath yet may be unrecognized in a
given approach or even denied, to retain a way of doing things and
thinking, beliefs, etc.
so, a potential exists and perhaps it is like basic research of
architecture or a given discipline, where it may not be ready to be
applied or may question fundamental assumptions and this is purposeful
and can be extraordinarily beneficial if it cracks open the
malmodeling that may become standardized as approach, and allow other
development to occur by falsifying given notions or providing
alternative paths or techniques. and yet also, infrastructure can
exist that forbids this from occurring, that limits any such
conceptions, or confines questioning to what amounts to only small
tweaks in the functional circuitry because it is a situation that is
nearly completely controlled and there is little room within for
fundamental changes and an entire system would need to be rebuilt from
scratch to replace what exists, otherwise. and there are dreamers who
do this, and architects who focus on utopia. or modeling of cities.
Frank Lloyd Wright (FLlW) had his vision for the development of the US
which was based on a different approach to city planning,
democratizing it via planning principles if not mistaken, though part
of this was developing a low-cost affordable home (if not made of
concrete), the USonian home, a unit or component in the larger
integrated plan of massive development. Le Corbusier had skyscrapers
and green spaces as part of the Ville Radieuse (my memory is gone
though approximating a general sketch of approaches) and both these
efforts were based on social goals, what architecture and master
planning can effect via focused development. and Arcosanti by Paolo
Soleri is yet another example, building a prototype community with new
building techniques as part of a larger vision that is potentially
counterpoint to the existing approach, and that there is a tradition
of this questioning of existing development patterns and yet it is
also fraught with issues in the realm of ideas as relativism bounds
such inquiry.
for accuracy it should be noted that this innovation in thinking has
basically evaporated from the practice of architecture, it is
completely without support as a research endeavor in the given model
of education and development, as if the technical approach + aesthetic
fashion is the peak sum of its content as fixed-idea, though it is
more a purification of given ideology intimately tied to existing
warped economic, social, political agendas evidenced as "culture" that
is antihuman, against nature, against thought, essentially
anti-architecture as it exists.
so the conceptual potential of architecture, the critical questioning
of assumptions can be lost or drown out by other priorities or values,
superseded by a particular view or agenda that in turn limits what can
be pursued in that domain, as it becomes normalized, made a shared
worlview, institutionalized. yet likewise, detached from fundamentals
edited or censored out of existence given the tyranny of convention or
otherwise, e.g. deceptive motivations.
and so at the edge of development, there could be little blood
occurring because there is no real-stake involved at this leading or
front position. it could be somewhat mundane or basic or commonplace,
detached from significance or risk, and more about continuing to
extend a particular approach than testing, questioning, learning and
pivoting into other unknown or newly discovered realms via discovery,
innovation, invention, failure even and falsfication of beliefs and
approaches. defeat of ideology. instead- there are no ideas,
potentially. just the same old beliefs repeated ad naseum yet without
questioning them again and again, thus to assume their rightness or
correctness through their repetition, no more integrity than that.
thus mediocrity as a type of security even, doing what has been done
as a validation process or confirmation of value, matching a pattern
as pattern and not its truth it must represent. and thus the
detachment, the moving away from what is vital, developing in the
wrong ways and directions towards a false viewpoint and framework, if
not at odds with what is needed. and this all occurs automatically-
especially in peoples minds and thinking, psychologies and relations,
as individuals and groups then combine into organizations, continuing
such efforts.
conceptual architecture is then about ideas. thinking through
architecture, architecture as a model, a medium for ideas. for
communication and relation. the importance of language in all the
above examples, and its fundamental relation to geometry (art, music,
architecture). and this fundamental consideration also involving a
kind of philosophical approach to the questioning, in terms of
research, the basics, fundamentals, foundation of disciplines and
beliefs, techniques approaches actions, methodology. questioning,
debate, discussion, the role of basic research in development, its
application over time via refinement, testing of hypotheses and
improvement of models and approaches. it is not just engineering
and it also involves a larger domain than just a detail, so while
research into concrete may always be ongoing, that concrete sidewalk
technology around for thousands of years since Roman times, the heated
sidewalk or improved wear or illumination or concrete via other
additives to the mixture is not in itself a larger modeling of the
depth and breadth of the question of architecture beyond that narrowed
realm- though can be incorporated into it as a vital detail, and so
definitely is related, though a part of a larger research enterprise,
a larger more encompassing and ecosystem view, where each detail has
its value and importance and insight, yet in the realm of ideas, 'big
ideas' need to occur to frame the big situations, and to limit these
to finite or specific details then bounds what can occur.  it is
equivalent to saying we can build skyscrapers to look like furniture
and if that is all it involves, a vast many other potential realms of
questioning or consideration can be lost in the process as it is
defined and conceived, in terms of what is and is not considered, put
on the table in terms of questioning. for most the skyscraper itself
as a building type has become a default solution, so too the high rise
city as a defacto approach to eco/soc/pol development, yet it is
fraught with vast many problems and creates and solidifies certain
patterns that are ineffective, inefficient, though believed the
correct way because that is the standard, the way things are done
today and how wealth or success has been generated. it is an engine,
in other words, that provides momentum to many industries and
questioning it as foundation could even be heretical. and thus if
questioning is removed, everything works just like a machine. yet a
machinery that is functioning against life, the earth, people,
economics, society, and other dimensions if a true accounting were to
take place beyond the controlled viewpoint that secures this approach.
conceptual architecture potentially could delve into these areas, yet
without support or even vital influence upon these processes, either
for being unrealistic or uneconomical or without existing capacity,
technology, or other limitations that restrict alternatives from
developing. again- the lack of research and its replacement by a
default 'ideology' the indicator that the process is determined by an
existing agenda that does not want to be fundamentally questioned in
its rightness, correctness as method, practice, income-generating
and yet an amazing discipline such as architecture can then lose its
soul, its essence, its insight and become shallow, ungrounded from
reality, and force disconnection through its development which then is
no longer actual or real architecture and instead something else, a
substitute process that stands-in for it as mimic, yet operating
within different principles that confine questioning to a narrow range
of consideration that basically destroys it, the ideas turning to
answered questions, architecture turned against itself, becoming only
a question of engineering, the art of construction being about
decorative buildings instead. though no deep insight into the human
condition beyond an archaeological condition where these forms can be
evaluated, analyzed, as they map to social, political, economic
issues, versus serving people as part of a heightened moral and
ethical obligation, service to culture and its development, not
turning away from it for money or just another career, etc. and thus
'the ideas' of architecture are nowhere to be found within the field
as it exists today, they are instead censored out of it by default of
the existing securing of ideology within institutions as this then is
the basis for further development within constrained parameters of
"design" that has more in common with the particularities of fashion
than wide-ranging investigation into questions and understanding and
development of culture in its highest manifestation, to include the
role of technology and its coherent and innovative integration within
built form, which instead becomes a manufacturers and industry
consideration: "smart homes", etc. this versus master planning of
civilization across all of its dimensions in a cohesive clear vision.
this as context for cryptography, in that there may be a standard
approach via public-key or other security systems in place that have
become normalized, made routine as processes and that assumptions may
readily exist as 'solutions' that remain bounded in given
considerations while there could be more going on beyond the existing
framework or limits of these same systems in practice, when evaluated
in terms of basic research, tweaked or tested or broken, and this
appears part of a vital process of improving and securing
cryptographic systems even. that a basic RD&D process exists already,
though to still question- within what parameters and is it possible
that the existing modeling is based on fundamental assumptions that
could in some way be limited or narrowed and a larger inquiry is
restricted because of these beliefs that become 'assumed truths' via
their restricted boundaries,  as if knowns or certainties due to
history or precedent yet these not brought back into questioning again
(reinterpreting of previous models, as if archeological ruins even,
where new insights may still be available or other approaches
discovered through their reevaluation and testing of assumptions).
it is to question if there may be a distinction made between
cryptography that is operational and active, that exists as an
infrastructure and working system (however rube-goldberg the issues of
implementation, chaos of variability as it connects with
secured/insecure modes), and what may be a more research-oriented
approach, not just into mathematical approaches to cryptographic
modules, and instead potentially further into the most basic realm of
crypto questioning, perhaps at the level of signs & symbols (language)
and how operations function (geometry) instead of an algorithm that is
operational as software approach or methodology, within a given or
existing set of parameters or assumptions that may be relied upon yet
also may be limited or even false in certain instances or deny other
approaches from occurring.
in other words, it is to wonder if there is a realm of 'conceptual
cryptology' that may already exist and yet not be defined or
understood this way, or 'conceptual cryptography' in a more particular
realm whereby these core questions of cryptographic models could be
pursued in their depth- or does the existing institutionalization of
these "ideas" restrict these inquiries due to a forced perspective of
ideology, a particular value system that relates to economic, social,
political pressures that retain a given approach for the good of
institutional control or manufacturing or to keep validating the
static conception, even as it may deteriorate within its 'ideas' made
static, assumed true by their repetition and continual access,
matching the sign equals sign as confirmation of correctness, versus
grounding in this greater depth of inquiry and realm of potential and
perpetual insight, when going back to the source and evaluating the
situation with fresh eyes and minds, in the dimensions that exist,
which could be far more than is modeled or believed or allowed in
existing approaches or functioning.
as with archaeology and architecture, it is to question if
cryptography may have a unique in situ condition at this intersection
of language and geometry, that currently may exist outside its
conceptualization in terms of practice, as crypto is developed
systematically, as it is made into infrastructure via technology,
manufacturing, and extension of these. and here, of the danger of
ideology, answered questions that move towards further falsity, as if
unconscious, when questioning of 'ideas' becomes detached from action
and through further development becomes ever more disconnected from a
fundamental condition of truth than in service to it. and what if this
integrity, securing this foundation of cryptography in truth is
requirement for security, yet given existing parameters could be
ignored in its philosophical dimensions that predate, inform, and give
life to the discipline, yet may not be valued or identified or related
to this way, as it becomes institutionalized or supported, made into
systematic development.
is there such an entity as 'conceptual cryptography' and where does it
begin and end. how might it be different than a primarily engineering
based approach or evalaution or crypto. to what extent is it supported
and operational as inquiry, yet what parameters or domain does it
occupy, including in past times and efforts that map out this
relation, its core questioning. could it today function in non-crypto
domains yet influence crypto development, etc. and thus questions of
the universality and connectedness of patterns, their permutations and
relations, potential interdisciplinary relevance as language and
geometry across mediums.
(if not involving inquiries and in-depth research at the junction and
structural intersection of linguistics and mathematics, and a
wider-range of potential communication strategies.)

== re: Amazon LCD tablet ==
i grew up studying those giant shopping catalogs for Sears and JC
Penneys stores that had inventories of everything in stores and that
could be mail ordered. they were seemingly hundreds of pages thick,
consumer bibles of specific national retailer chains in the U.S. and
for those without encyclopedia, did offer an interesting look into the
development of digital watches as they took over analog, calculators,
early computing, electronic and video games, and then 'electrics'
spanning tools to housewares, various large and small appliances.
when the Amazon Kindle lineup went from e-ink only into a
mixed-category of LCD screens it seems to blur the distinction in
purpose between the e-reader devices and more ordinary tablets that
compete with others, in particular ecosystem-based devices from Apple.
my initial thought was that there were two different categories
occupying a single name of "Kindle" and that they were functionally
very different devices with different purposes.
while it is understood that 'tablets' are a category unto themselves
and need no further justification for existence in an online retail or
software/app model, it struck me as strange that there was not
something more conceptual going on with the Amazon HD Fire devices,
beyond ordinary tablet functionality, at least from what reviews
mention about it in terms of user experience and how it streamlines
access to Amazon services through the tablet UI.
one thought has stuck with me about the potential for this
tablet-Amazon ecosystem relation and it is that this device now
competes with others in a general 'multimedia' tablet category, yet
its real and potential advantage in terms of apps or whatever is its
unique connection to Amazon inventory, which spans multimedia in an
intranet sort of way, perhaps as if portal.
from here, location, in this particular and unique context of
relation between those who access Amazon through such a tablet
interface, it would appear the killer functionality of such an LCD
tablet would be to provide 'catalog-like functionality' in the style
of earlier paper-based approaches, such as the Sears Catalog and
others, though perhaps beyond just existing approaches determined by
web interfaces and into a higher degree of functionality, such that
the tablet actually is the Amazon Catalog in electronic format, in
particular- mail-order format whereby, say, ala Whole Earth Catalog or
Hammacher Schlemmer, you could potentially order anything that Amazon
lines up into its supply-chain, even if for a one-time sale, via such
a massively connected inventory and integrated yet distributed
delivery system.
This probably sounds very bad to some peoples ears in terms of the
impact or effects this could have if suddenly Amazon is bidding on
installing pools in the neighborhood, though perhaps it would be
bounded to certain things like European appliances that are imported
or other high-rated, quality based interactions vetted by a
review-system recovered from the troubles of existing feedback
environments internet-wide.
curated merchandize, then, that is presented in deep categories of
content, with additional information (requiring dimensions of items
from manufacturers, etc) and matrix-based searching functions (using
grids and geometry to search instead of only keywords) that then are
the basis for a _new_design of the Amazon interface that standardizes
the interface and user experience with the available inventory,
instead of relying on existing web technologies to define parameters
for what can occur in these interactions, including variable results.
What this is to question is why the Amazon Fire LCD tablet is
competing in a multimedia category as if just another tablet when
instead it could be 'the Amazon Catalog' instead and while able to
deliver movies, music, book content, that ultimately a programmatic
hierarchy could exist that this is a platform for interfacing with and
accessing Amazon inventory firstly, before that secondary utility,
which allows delivery of online data (movies, movies) though also, and
primarily it is assumed: offline 'content' in terms of sales from its
warehouses and third party suppliers, and thus is the basis for
creating, sustaining, and developing this huge momentum in sales, or
having it operate in more conventional terms, competing as another
tablet in a highly competitive space, and perhaps not having this
catalog-functionality as its core mission to the extent that this is
how the tablet is designed, its fundamental purpose and advanced
functionality, versus just an extension of existing web technology
approaches that leverage an excellent e-commerce experience though
remain heavily defined by what is a very low-resolution 'catalog' of
its inventory, when instead there could be more extensive information
about each item, so that people do not need to research missing facts
or data repeatedly and instead it could be presented as advanced specs
(dimensions, materials, warnings; contains lead, requires widget Z),
that combined with expert reviews or more in-depth analysis could
transform the experience into a research-based activity where all of
the necessary data is in the Amazon Catalog, perhaps not the web
version, but the tablet catalog version that acts like an encyclopedia
attached to extended or other content or dimensions.
For instance, if a product attaches to a table, yet no information is
provided for how this connection takes place or how deep or thick the
table must be, the same item could be ordered and then returned if it
does not fit a particular table. And if this information is not
provided for in the reviews, then orders and returns are the 'feedback
process' that is in effect a negative interaction as a total exchange,
inefficient, and time-wasting for everyone when instead that
additional information which could be known to be critical (no less by
the product manufacturer) could be provided as _missing detail in the
current approach, in many cases, with sales across the online retailer
landscape. It could require several google searches of discussion
forums or downloading PDF manuals to get this information if it exists
or a call to the manufacturer, all that stands in the way between
simply evaluating the item and then deciding it will work and clicking
through the sale. Instead this short-circuit of necessary or missing
information could require dozens of clicks and several searches of
discussion groups looking for answers or clues to what may become a
mystery by default.
Consider then the condition whereby there is lack of basic information
in this entire process, encountered with online retailers and
e-commerce in general, not just Amazon of course. It is assumed when
product data went online, that perhaps nothing new was expected of the
items in the way they were modeled as 'data' in terms of their sale.
Yet for instance this same product was in a store in yesteryear, it
could be touched, evaluated as a 3-dimensional item, and if it
attached to a table the mechanism to do this could be evaluated or a
box could be opened by a worker to help evaluate the device to see if
it actually would fit a particular table or not - prior to sale. And
here is point: the information is available for the person in the
store, though when it is sold online this information may be
non-existent online even though it is a very basic consideration for
its practical and successful use in basic scenarios and everyday
conditions. It is unexceptional to ask such questions in an offline
context, yet when this same questioning occurs in a remote
'catalog-context' or 'online retailer' context often there is no one
to ask or anyone who knows the answer, and it instead is a gamble.
The way this is made to work is by offering free returns, and yet this
also effects other prices and is a structural inefficiency if it could
be solved and such returns unnecessary when they could instead be
avoided, due to an issue such as 'missing information' that is
important to the seller and the buyer, to know enough about the item
at the center of such exchange.
Thus, of various products sold online, consider if they had a more
robust and in-depth data model that consisted of various "dimensions",
and therefore if there were these attachment devices to tables, you
could narrow a search for such items not just by the main category
{tablet attachment}, and instead further by subset details, such as
{clamp to 2-3/4 inches} when others only may only open to 1-1/4 inch
and therefore would not fulfill the criteria.
And so in modeling a particular item or device, as category, it could
be modeled in various subset details that may already occur in areas
like HDTV sets, to some limited extent (a bit too fuzzy whereby false
positives are frequent as with many hierarchical approaches based on,
it is assumed words versus geometric structures based on such
functional details). In some sense it could be equivalent to a limited
'dimensional-search' via matrix, that in some cases may involve
measurement (height-width-depth), color, form or shape, materials, and
other specifics (calories, toxins, requirements). Then instead of
searching from the general to the specific, looking for the needle, a
person could start with the needle, knowing what they usually are
looking for -though cannot find- and located it through geometry of
such data.
In this way, potentially the future of online catalogs in a tablet
interface as it may streamline the process of interaction and exchange
with this data ecosystem of media and other goods.
(concepts: patterns, typologies, variable details, relational structures)
(also, this strategy could be used for other search via structurally
organized -if meta- data as a content or information search via
categories, dimensions, graphs and grid. dimensions, 3- and N-value
logic, set theory, AI interface and interactions. tending toward
'living queries' where, given parameters, search could continue or
map/carto/survey realms, provide reconaissance, report back data
structures, variables. this could be basis for custom data structure
of PC, a model built up over many queries, spanning local-global
structure, heuristic feedback, etc.)

"Modern cryptographic equipment consists of nothing more than a 'black
box' with powerful digital processors and advanced mathematical
algorithms. There is not much to see, and there are definitely no
moving parts. We realize that this is probably where our collection of
historical cipher equipment will end. However, there are numerous
earlier cipher machines and much of this is still undiscovered. 'New'
old machines will, no doubt, pup-up and many side-tracks will be
walked. Furthermore, the history of some famous cipher machines is
still very clouded, leaving much to be researched and much to be
discovered in the years to come.

:-:-:-: Ten books - Vitruvius, recontextualization :-:-:-:
i wanted to substantiate an approach to crypto in a larger context
from its parallel within architecture as a discipline that involves
real-time development based on principles that are shared as a
framework and value system, in other words common consciousness about
a given domain or areas of importance or relevance as this effects
what can or cannot develop.
in the existing late 20th c. worldview my research interests into
electrification as critical to understanding the existing built
environment had no place within the history books. such views are
literally erased, censored from books, both as content though also
imagery, there are few 'electrical poles' in those fashion photographs
of buildings, removing the ubiquitous context of infrastructure, as if
they function in a more pure condition than are reliant upon an
external source of power, light, heat, than 'the elements' of nature
and sunlight. because those are the beliefs, shade shadow mass spatial
experience, pre-electric, communication about experience shared in a
context of 'the senses' removed of their electromagnetic truth, such
that ungrounded subjectivism and indoctrination into a world view is
established and _must be followed to succeed in the systematized view
and training to become an architect, within such narrowed parameters.
to continue to extend the existing ideology in this way.
so it was necessary to find justification for such thinking and
consideration, and Plato offers this in terms of conceptualizing the
state as a body, essentially a nervous system. and then considering
this in terms of its governance. how the individual and group are
established via various principles of relation, what is prioritized,
there were also many fragmentary views from Modernist masters relating
to electrical aesthetics, i think it was Walter Gropius who related
the eyeball to the television set, and Le Corbusier had great interest
in the aesthetics of electrification, generators, motors, turbines.
and so an archaeological aspect, yet not integrated into a larger
framework. so as it happens, this continues to a threshold where
scholar-architects Venturi, Scott-Brown, and Izenour share very
insightful observations about the developing electromagnetic
landscape, to include such aesthetics of infrastructure relied upon
(in the desert no less, for life sustaining a/c and casinos and
signage: essentially OASIS and MIRAGE), in their Learning from Las
Vegas and yet the strong and silent type still does not mention or
investigate the electrical order while certainly referencing it and
including it within the chaos of the built environment in the
photographs taken. and yet, in architectural history, there is
supposedly no precedent, no way to make the case that this
infrastructure is an extension of architecture, of fundamental and
foundational relation as an ordering device within the city grid, its
planned development (ala plug-in city, though originating millennia
ago). and yet there is direct lineage with these billboards along the
highway that cars drive by and signage along busy routes near ancient
cities, the present day is an extension of similar structure and order
over a long span of time. it is part of a language, although it may
become subconscious, mediated in other terms or only indirectly, else
could be edited out as 'not architecture' which is the default
what interested me about this, and i am not sure exactly the sequence
my readings occurred, though in deciding to delve into reading a
classic work of literature, the earliest account of architectural
authority (in the West) in terms of its classical culture and
development, if not mistaken, is that it was unlike the existing
conception of what architecture is, and had a far wider boundary for
knowledge and interpretation that today has been narrowed by special
and private interests in a 'training approach' to office workers than
an educational approach that questioned the parameters of
architecture, beyond a confined technical enterprise that overlaps
aesthetics onto a deterministic approach to answered problems of
culture, society, economic development, and political agendas driving
the development, its destructiveness.

(Classical Orders: Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, Tuscan, Composite)
...though also about armaments and fortifications, about the quality
of water in wells (wells that produce black bile or something along
these lines), and various other important areas of knowledge in terms
of buildings and development in their larger realm of functioning,
which today would include areas like environment and defense as part
of this architectural inquiry and area of knowledge- for how
architecture exists and functions. In this way, to understand nature
and surrounding culture, infrastructure would fit into this same
approach, and without it the existing dwellings, buildings, the entire
built environment, cities themselves- do not make any sense because
they cease to function without electricity. A skyscraper no longer
functions in this era without electrical elevators and ventilation
systems, lighting, etc. A home would lose its washing machine, food
storage, communications ability, etc. And yet this vital and basic
information is left out of the equation, removed from architecture as
a viewpoint, which is ridiculous, and not allowed in 'reasoning'
within the schools likewise. In this way the ideas of architecture are
shallow, hollowed out of their meaning for a surface-based
interpretation, which serves a particular oil-based development agenda
the reason this was introduced here is because of ancient principles
now absent within the realm of architecture: approximated as
Commidity, Firmness, and Delight... these principles are often
presumed or claimed to exist for the given approach to image-based
development yet have become signage-only, language game seeking to
misrepresent what is going on, as if more is occurring, higher minded
activity than a base activity under the guise of architecture
Commodity, Firmness, and Delight, or Toward a New Architectural Attitude
(for instance, commodity replaced by anti-economy as 'economics';
firmness by using false foundation and understanding for development,
thus developing ungrounded civilization, and 'bliss of ignorance'
delight while this process is being subverted for ulterior motives).
There is misalignment and misrepresentation and short-circuiting and a
sabotaged detour going on within the ancient_tradition of
architecture, whereby today is functions directly against and in
opposition to these principles, most especially in the area they could
be evaluated and-or acknowledged, within the education system which
instead is ruled by an anti-architecture ideology. against thought,
against action, functioning against truth, grounded reasoning itself.
and then one day recently in trying to remember the above tripartite
concept, the mingling of its present incarnation as Fear, Uncertainty,
Doubt appeared in the fog of my mind, though was rendered as: Fear,
Uncertainty, and Delight, instead. and to me this illuminated this
very closely correlated development, removed of its camouflage, suc
that FUD is the equivalent set of principles by which development
occurs in a context of developing of this insecurity, uncertainty, and
incapacitation of people, most notably through ideology of relativism
and binary views based on biased authority structures and control over
reasoning and feedback.
another sample of wreckage from this same broken brain is that of the
Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, the book and also the excellent movie
(c.1949) with Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal.
there is controversy over interpretation of the ideas involved, though
i think an accurate grounding of observation neutralizes the beliefs,
when truth is the arbiter of actions and not just ego, as if belief in
superior vision is justification for higher awareness development that
others just cannot understand and thus lone geniuses stand alone in
obscurity, which then is how the corruption of the star system occurs
with celebrity architecture and development of 'aesthetic buildings'
are removed from larger issues of economics, societal, and their
political reliance and extension of given systems of corrupt power,
instead of questioning these, and thus in some sense 'the cathedrals'
built represent these values, as if glossy advertisements for a
culture devoid of culture, just about shiny objects and immediate
sensory experience that no longer connects with larger surrounding
issues or has a larger impact on lives than in an ecological negative,
like playing music on the titanic as it is sinking,  yet not
accounting for this part of the situation, as if heightened experience
when instead blindness. the entire system supporting this development,
all students, interning as peasants to upkeep offices that churn out
cultural pablum as if 'high conceptualization' when devoid of this, in
truth. then the conceit of the architect in this domain, as if
knowledgeable of what is going on as if in continuance of vitrivuian
awareness, or mastery within the built environment, when basic
reasoning and observation long ago failed in order to support the
ruling oppressive ideology.
so here is the contrast, the other way of considering this: that the
architect who removes themselves from the process of development as an
individual (i.e. human), then revolves around the issue of identity,
awareness, self-conception. issues of governance, models of the state
from individual to group, such that a 'shared identity' (humans) could
be this same individual and may have removed themselves from the
existing treachery, allowed this process of devolution to occur, and
thus the absence of architecture, its truth, then can be made evident,
the lack of culture in those 'representing culture' as stand-ins,
mimics, of a false order and false reality and false perspective
sustained and relied upon for the shallow relations based on another
foundation or set of parameters: say, base materialism, money.
further, 'the architect' may be assumed to thus be one person, one
individual, yet in this way a shared identity can compose this person,
such that the person is human, and as others are also human, they too
are involved in this condition, via shared awareness and values. thus,
a networking of realization or shared state as it were, via whatever
conceptual scaffolding or consciousness is sustained as entablature,
such that wave-collapse does not occur, and the post-and-lintel
connections between here and there are sustained between human beings.
likewise and vitally important, that 'architecture' is a
meta-condition as exampled by ancient conception that ranges beyond
the existing modeling, yet is fragmented and not integrated as a total
discipline in this way. naval architecture is one aspect,
traditionally, though also computer architecture and other areas. the
principles or even code, common structures, and programming (such
that, for instance, music and architecture are closely empirically
related, and essentially everything is, in terms of aesthetics in
terms of its truth and intelligence), then a wider range of activity
may be occuring as 'architecture' than is accounted for, and yet it
may be the truth of its condition, as certain principles are or are
not observed and served. for instance, serving public interest by
having safe water and waste disposal infrastructure versus relying on
toxic systems that despoil the environment, or stewardary of wildlife
and landscape and environments as this relates to weather and
ecosystems or denying these or exploiting them, say with engineering
weather for political manevering and strategy, and to enact certain
development patterns via forced desertification and manipulating
demographic and other flow patterns, as this can become an illegal
basis for creating and sustaining power, off the books, because it is
not included in the observations or analysis, unaccounted for.
further, that any 'architecture' is not at the hand and mind just of
the architect, though in its *implementation*, involving all who are
involved in its development, relying upon a shared awareness and value
system (truth) else subverted in its conception, communication, and
construction, by sabotage or other mistakes, errors, or misalignments
that weaken it. and thus the coherence in the group action to build
something upon a foundation, and how this is achieved, from idea to
its actualization (just like circuitry in technological devices that
then can break in or out of warranty via poor manufacturing or
deceitful practices baked-in).
it is this myth of completely independent action, that the individual
achieves something in its entirely -alone- that is a clean-room
conceptualization of a process that involves many who are part of the
larger process of design, construction, and development, and that this
'functioning together as one' is in some sense 'the architect' in its
larger coherent state, of shared awareness, continuum throughout the
various circuitry that establishes and sustains relations in their
truth, in the shared direction, moving together towards the same
goals. each person having an important role, each part having its own
importance in achieving functioning of the larger integerated whole.
not just as a machine, as a culture, as an idea though further- a
living idea, a living truth that is shared, that governs, principles
that are not merely referred to and referenced as if authority, and
instead, awareness and understanding that is based within and upon
knowing, a way of being or competency that develops in each as a
unique vantage of the common situation, another perspective yet
contributing toward a total perspective, allowing error correction and
greater accuracy than any single viewpoint.
in this way the people who create the materials are part of the
building process, part of the vital development of civilization and
culture, those who construct buildings and systems and develop this
order are vital for its implementation and have feedback and insight
to offer as part of this process, for how given approaches could be
improved or made more economical or with greater strength or
in this way, this coordinated empirical shared effort of many
functioning as one, to include engineers, designers, craftspeople,
tradespeople, workers, manufacturers, technologists, scientists, and
others, including programmers and security developers --- all of these
people are involved in the 'ideas' of architecture, as it is
integrated beyond narrowed boundaries and considered as a larger
conceptual model of how it actually functions, when accounting for its
various and many details and manifestations and dimensions that must
be developed, designed, built, and implemented correctly and
successfully, for the project to have integrity. to be able to endure
over time and function correctly, versus being designed and developed
to fall apart as today via any number of compromises or unshared
goals, lowered principle.
in other words, the potential exists that 'the architect' is in this
larger scale and framework of shared activity amongst many functioning
as one, and that no single person could feasibly be functioning in all
these domains, (unless extraordinary circumstances of all-knowing,
then all truth would be addressed not ignored in the building process,
tending towards utopia).
this is to suggest that 'architecture' could be occurring within a
wide range of realms that are not yet integrated in a larger
conception, conceptualization, or modeling accurately maps to its true
nature and functioning, its inherent interdisciplinary awareness that
integrates into a cohesive understanding spanning these various
domains. and lacking this, the conceit would be that a person could
know more than a tiny fragment of this immensity and alone be able to
shape all of these forces and meld them into a direction as an
individual, because of their truth, instead of having this be an issue
of 'shared identity' of those like who also relate to the situation in
similar dimensions and together can move towards a given direction as
one entity, diverse and multiplicitous yet organized, gaining not
losing coherence- order. and in this way, perhaps a context of entropy
and ideas, likewise, and security issues involved.
(in other words: it is not ungrounded group ego detached from or
ignoring 'truth' that is this shared momentum as development, nor of
an individual that is part of this. such that each pseudo-work is
considered 'the great work' that amounts to mediocrity, if analyzed
further beyond narrowed boundary. instead, of integrity, foundation
common to action, verified and sustained and modeled in its truth, in
service to it, then each point relating to others, lineage from one
structuring to the next, nodes interconnecting within dimensions, this
awareness, then interactions that build upon this stability, this
accurate understanding and modeling, such that it is a common or
shared development, it benefits the whole and the part and each is in
service to the truth of others who are operating within shared
principles, dimensions, and then learning from others, integrating
views, understanding, awareness, evolving a higher capacity and
improving, optimizing functioning, relation, communication, ability to
operate with cohesion yet still error-correct. what are the rules,
logic, truth, reasoning, falsifiability, the ability of debate to lead
to win-win interactions even while in contest because truth benefits
all through its discovery and development, new social dynamics and
understanding and awareness based on this, difficulties faced
betwixt-and-between as the conflict or friction is extreme, working
through the wrong models or moving through the false concepts or
limitations, breaking things down, pain and agony of not knowing or
having limited questioning and then requestioning, losing certainty,
only to regain basic truth and model for any interaction, governance
versus politics, basic versus applied, novice vs. expert, and role of
learning and literacy and basic questions as the place this
functioning occurs, as people move together towards a higher-order or
dimensional integration, over time...)

note: i am not familiar with the indepth reasoning of Rem Koolhaas
related to ~shopping as a cultural activity though to me it cracked a
nut that opens a new universe of analysis about the actual behavior of
people in terms of material culture, social relations, etc. in that it
provides a context for evaluations on par with anthropology and
archeology, of the present situation.

so this is meant to provide context for the following ideas... that
is, there is more to gain from a commercial advertisement in its
cultural depth than just a monetary transaction. (this moves into the
business page of daily newspapers as a tally of ongoing applied
philosophy, where business philosophy is the presiding worldview, the
shared communication that most effects the transformation and
development of culture- as ideas. (moreso: ideology though, as many
sacred beliefs are unquestionable and most things occur in such rigid
frameworks, ungrounded from external variables and falsifications, so
essentially protected views that can be and are weak structurally,
though within a bubble civilization seem peak insight).
beyond scaling of unchecked materialism and profit-based onesided
exchange (of beliefs) there can be lots going on in the development of
material artifacts, processes, as these effect social relations,
activities, various detailing of or within culture, in given sets of
of the basic situation then of commerce, exchange, things that are
conceived of, invented or extended, -made-, developed into systems
small and large, then of the corresponding ideas attached to them,
that move alongside the movement of artifacts as they located in
culture, and find their place. as if shards of pottery someday to be
unearthed in various geographies that then matches a common culture
across distances and differences, via such evidence.
then to encounter such an advertisement:

graphic about another music tool that went high concept, into a realm
of big ideas and reminded me of the question i repeatedly wonder about
and then forget, once having known the basic situation....
part of the human nervous system is actually digital and part of it is
analog. and to me this is an important fact about the technological
environment people are living within, especially in terms of sensing
and how coupling with external signals and communications or
exfiltration of biological or physiological information could occur,
if not aspects of remote control over the nervous system via these
same means. and yet as shared view or model of humanity to discuss
ongoing oppressive dynamics in worse-case scenarios- non-existent! not
awareness or understanding except within a field of expertise that is
often politicized, such that there are agendas within professions;
political science -> political medicine -> political neurology and the
next thing you know a drone is flyign overhead and the emg-test you
last had forces a twitch in your arm via EM reflex and you drive off
the cliff. do not need to wait for automated cars to steer you off the
road, it can already happen today, if such systems are 'weaponized'.
what is to prevent such dynamics from existing if they are not
accounted for. and thus this is only one aspect, the danger of not
knowing, yet what may be realized if such a model of the
electromagnetic human was understood or part of the conceptualization
of shared relations, part of the intellectual framework that mediates
the world in a sea of toxic signalling, and what is the limit or
boundary for this happening, (the entire education system for
so a non EM-worldview and non-EM humans existing in electromagnetic
civilization as shared context yet believing the self 'outside' this
perspective for analysis and evaluation, having rationalized and
accounted for activity only in non-EM terms and conceptualization.
sounds like the wrong mathematics of zero again. what is the structure
of the human nervous system, how does this digital and-or analog
circuitry relate to issues of infrastructure, wireless communication,
potential frameworks for consciousness, embodiment, being.
(note: in exploring basic electronics, the category of sensors
fascinated me, especially in regard to common features they share,
such as strain, and their often ~analog nature, as well as a principle
of reversibility in functioning, as if of a deeper symbiotic
connection involved)
(what then does it mean for an all-digital computer in terms of
'processing' or reasoning, versus a hybrid system that matches
functionality of nervous system in its dynamic range)

[excerpt]  II. Philosophers' Distinctions - II.1 Von Neumann
       "The nervous system is based on two types of communications:
those which do not involve arithmetical formalisms, and those which
do, i.e. communications of orders (logical ones) and communications of
numbers (arithmetical ones). The former may be described as language
proper, the latter as mathematics. (von Neumann, 1958, 80)"
Von Neumann's The Computer and the Brain, written in 1956 and
published in 1958, made the analog/digital distinction relevant to
philosophy by claiming that the logics and mathematics of the central
nervous system, viewed as representational systems, must "structurally
be essentially different from those languages to which our common
experience refers" (1958, 82). He has in mind here both natural
language and binary mathematics. [...]

as with crypto basics and possibilities, it is my belief that the
basic breadboard circuit in its actual dynamics has not been fully
accounted for, in that the relation of charge (+/-) including neutral
or  'ground' is not adequately modeled in accurate terms of existence
and instead a structural skew exists that sends everything into a
particular direction. also with crypto that becomes about mathematic
equations and 'beliefs' about signage, than of other dynamics that
exist in the same realm yet whose dimensions may be unrecognized,
ignored, or without value in a given methodology or approach, while
inherently relevant to the core ideas and cryptologic processes. i do
not think or believe the basic circuit has been figured out, that it
remains a question. that the analog digital aspects of the circuit may
be wrongly modeled or conceptualized in the actual terms they exist -
because LOGIC. because of a binary (and yes, thus 'digital' ideology)
approach that favors a certain rationalization as if universal
reasoning when it breaks down at a given threshold or boundary yet
continues on as a 'belief system' in certain assumptions and views
that can be inaccurate or illusory, if not deceptive, false. when the
dynamics between a basic circuit and model of the atom and thus
molecules in which the identical charge relations exist and provide
momentum -do not align or match up- in terms of how they are conceived
and what is going on with grounding (mathematics of zero), such that
"infinity" is made or modeled as if finite, removed from dynamics,
then the potential that is in the realm of N-value is also removed,
made 'digital' as it were even with analog modeling. and it would seem
so too crypto, 'quantum' processing itself seemingly more analog in
the range of parallelism as basis for computation, as a natural
process of equilibrium even, perhaps. and how much of the multi- or
non-linearity of circuitry, its ecological or ecosystem based ~complex
dynamics similar exist in this as a foundational, fundamental context,
firstly, before the digital even develops as a simple on/off switch,
then to represent and model _everything in that reductionist
framework, and claim its signage to represent all that is.
(without accurate logical accounting can such modeling be accurate in
its grounded truth, if this truth is unrecognized or unreferenced
beyond binary biasing and distortion (digital worldview?). how much of
observation is contained or trapped within its warping(etc);)
maybe thinking is not up-to-speed with material interactions, a gap
between models and reality, yet beliefs in accurate representations
that are limiting, based on misconceptions. thus, remove logic
(empirical and error-corrected grounded reasoning) and
electromagnetism, and try conceptualizing computers and crypto in that
context and see what happens. this.
computers are based on _logic, yet a particular kind that is warped
and ideological and is in error as a neutral observational viewpoint.
developing this bias as technological worldview is then enshrining a
false empiricism and vault of the 'digital sky' as consciousness when
it acts and functions against actual consciousness in its ungrounded,
unchecked state, as if 'being' itself. exploitation of this condition
(a kind of magic, sorcercy) tending towards evil as it moves further
and further away from truth and serves and extends the false approach,
what is essentially a shared lie if facts and truth are ignored,
censored, etc. total power, control over a developing system that at
its core is based on error. here, morality, ethics, absence of law
that upholds the false framework as it is institutionalized,
"believed" via leap of faith, ignoring the gap, denying the gap, for
all the material rewards it can yield to its developers. unchecked of
course, forbid from error correction. the representation replacing
reality. the sign becoming truth, that detachment, ungrounded
condition. just like circuit & adam.

1. if prohibition of alcohol = control of speech, as a side-effect,
via behavioral influence, that is, sobriety; what is prohibition of
crypto? control of controversial thoughts and connections, an indirect
form of secondary censorship. Fahrenheit 451 tactics- actual crypto
the fire.
2. if everything is backdoored already, essentially key escrow exists
as the basic situation, instead of having private keys the NSA has a
master key per standard, implementation, other. if this was inside a
known legal framework, that perhaps would be tolerable with oversight,
yet without oversight where tyranny takes over, then everything is
pawned/owned by NSA who could forcibly censor without consequence as
part of a hidden political strategy, etc.
(all tools broken so a crypto scheme can function, leading to all
tools remotely breakable?)
3. question of literature as applied cryptography in
linguistic/typographic model, and also cryptology in decryption
approaches to embedded codes and ciphers, yet perhaps not a strategy
for encryption within ordinary bounded means and measures. are there
in this way two or more distinct approaches, only one that finds
itself in the parameters of computer encryption/decryption as modeled,
and the others reside in a realm of data mining and other statistical
correlations that may function in a realm of cryptanalysis and-or
code-breaking though using different tools and approaches than strong
encryption that currently reigns.
4. is there a unified crypto scheme or is it fragmented and does not
recognize itself in the mirror as its own 'whole' self due to a limit
for this structural-conceptual integration. in this way could
cryptography be schizoid in having two or more parallel systems,
disconnected strategies that function outside boundaries of the other,
and may remain unrecognized. that is, literature/language/linguistics
as crypto versus mathematic encrypt/decrypt schemes, each having their
own ecosystems and boundaries, paths that may never cross or meet
within the given parameters or dimensions as evaluated by the other,
or may exist as unbroken ciphers within other ciphers, encrypted code
within decrypted communications that remains unrecognized due to this
unrelated, ungrounded condition between them.
5. in this way could having 'answers' at the ready (GOTO 2) then
provide confirmational bias that a correct decrypt has been achieved
within a limited view that then becomes foundation for a false
perspective, represented by mathematics. and may a particular
rationalization (GOTO 1) that is enforced as if objectivity defined,
then become the basis for an illusion of mastery or control over
limited dimensionality and observational frameworks, themselves
becoming the basis for an insecure crypto framework (see 1). in other
words, without or banning abberations, then leading to a false
condition of certainty by containing what is or may be uncontainable,
making finite the infinite question and potential parameters into a
'small world'(model); ineffective at best in accounting for actual
crypto, operating.
6. does a hybrid crypto approach exist that remains unrecognized,
whereby both a linguistic even 'literature-based' crypto could exist
alongside mathematical encryption techniques yet remain unrecognized
in the "official" institutional model of cryptography, perhaps even
with a missing cryptological foundation or background, that limits a
realm of computer crypto to a narrow investigation of algorithms and
security inside a bounded, finite domain? (see 3/645)

Keeping the lights on: Mechanical engineer
finds a way to predict cascading power outages
"Each individual component does not know what the collective state of
affairs is," said Mezic. Current methods rely on a steady, abundant
supply, producing enough energy to flow through the grid at all times,
regardless of demand, he explained. However, should part of a grid
already operating at capacity fail—say in times of disaster, attack or
malfunction—widespread blackouts all over the system can occur.
"Everybody shuts down," Mezic said. The big surges of power left
unregulated by the malfunctioning component can either overload and
burn out other parts of the grid, or cause them to shut down to avoid
damage, he explained. The result is a massive power outage and
subsequent economic and physical damage. The Northeast Blackout of
2003 was one such event, affecting several U.S. states and part of
Canada, crippling transportation, communication and industry.

this observation arose from a recent conversation about influence
of alcohol on behavior and mood. where someone who drinks can
say things that they otherwise may not, and in this way a given
viewpoint may have a deeper grounding in the emotions that are
not being accounted for, and could be realized or accessed when
decompressing or reaching equilibrium in another phase or state
of awareness, via inebriation. the role of legal & illegal substances
in relation to edge of insight and cultural development likewise.
thus the aberrant statement or communication that may occur
via this communication is not necessarily less truth, only that
it may not be acknowledged or accounted for in the given view
or modeling. thus, a kind of equilibrium or balancing of forces,
or equalization across parameters known and unknown, those
documented and hidden, via inebriation. for instance, anger if
it arises when drinking and hidden rage. or following ideology
and then when inebriated a person letting down their guard &
speaking their mind, etc. in this way, truth and ideas that may
not fit in the given model. and how this could be an influence
upon culture and conformity if removed and this unwitting or
known feedback does not occur, and a rigid view is upheld
as the cultural standard, instead. where this balancing of
forces may not take place due to its prohibition, even, as
this could advantage those managing skewed modeling
and using it to enforce a given approach, and limit any
alternatives because it does not fit inside the mindset
or belief system, and cannot be questioned beyond this.
in this way, sobriety is equated with a higher knowing or
state of being, potentially, seeing more clearly, when if
in its position it is bounded or limited, these areas of
previous feedback would essentially be outlawed and
not addressed, or set up a schizoid state of relation
by denying other dimensions or relations or dynamics,
as if everything is contained with a rationalization even,
versus breaking-through that boundary into chaos and-
or the unknown, or challenging beliefs about what truth
is and where control originates in the cosmic context.
in that there is a limit to what can be determined via
reductionism, though no limit to the belief of this,
which can stand uncorrected, opposed to truth and
greater evidence than what is allowed or sanctioned.
leading to this...
i understand the different interpretation, and did not
adequately define the analogy, well enough to be make
the correlation clear enough. in the book by Ray Bradbury
it is the truth and ideas in the medium of the book that are
at issue, not just books but their use as a transmission of
beliefs, of alternative (non-sober) principles that challenge
the ruling order that seeks to extinguish this otherness
that is essentially culture itself, knowledge, reality. that
is the basis for control over people and the civilization.
what this extends into further in a cryptography context
is that 'crypto' itself may be outlawed like books, not for
technical means to communicate, but because what is
communicated could be _secret and not controllable by
those who seek total control over what occurs in society.
thus truth, another viewpoint shared by people, especially
if counter to corrupt government, could be this fire held in
the container of crypto, and if it is broken by default and-or
corrupted by design, this other viewpoint could never develop
beyond a given set of parameters because those who think
differently are seen as and believed to be 'the enemy' within
a state that has become rogue and functions against its
own people, in order to forever secure its power over them.
in other words: ideas, truth, shared reasoning is the danger,
and if it cannot be safely exchanged without consequence,
losing your job or career or having ideas disallowed and thus
trading in bad thoughts, as if drunken ramblings even, then
through this prohibition of ideas and thinking, as it relates
to grand inquisitor like auditing of any private domains and
whatever "secrets" people may be sharing, then could be
equivalent to peering into the war plans of the enemy and
all of this could be mapped out into a strategy that seeks
to eliminate this risk of unknowns, to uphold empowered
and extending rationalization within a particular system
of belief that aligns with private politics and corruption,
state of hidden dictatorship, and engineering failure so
to sustain the corrupt works as enterprise planning.
in other words, no crypto, no protected boundary for
freedom of expression or freedom of thought/speech,
communication, or practice of religion even, without
hidden judge, jury, potentially executioner via NSA
and others who are like the monster under the bed,
though inside computers, minds, communications.
where did they get the right to enforce and defend
mediocrity, to pursue and extinguish truth that does
not fit into or is opposed to the ruling political ideology,
and to not have any oversight and be given carte blanche
to pursue a political agenda against citizens, a lawless
agenda that is actively oppressing people in civilization,
and seeks to uphold and enforce an unreal, antihuman
viewpoint that is based on subjugation and exploitation.
i mean if the NSA was going around abusing children
and connected with pedophile networks and seeking
to blacklist and exploit people based on porn habits
or enforcing a no-masturbation rule by "government",
that would be a pretty important insider story, no?
those are the politics also involved in these questions,
the kind of substitute culture that can at once uphold
an unrealistic worldview only to use this for exploitation.
that is what happens in situations of corruption, and in
situations of total corruption, it is institutionalized and
made mainstream yet cannot be communicated about.
so if the crypto is non-existent, so too is such reality.
anyone who starts to think can be persecuted by the
criminals and taken down in isolation, and framed as
if just another sinner via the inside-subversion. that is
how books with another viewpoint can offer perspective
otherwise outlawed, so too working cryptography that
cannot be decrypted. without it, shooting fish in a barrel.
i vote those who work at NSA should be made to wear
helmets and uniforms, and wear big 'key' medallions
around their necks, so we know we are totally owned.
(not sure which way the rubber hose prop should go,
if firehose or perhaps each wearing condom bandoleer)

additional correction/repair of perspective anomalies and errors...
.// further CORRECTION: once again clarification is needed regarding a
previous statement. this is both due to my own limits in
conceptualization and writing and also problems of language, when it
is extremely difficult to encompass all possible cases in a general
view without having contradictions. in my latest errored statement,
the mistaken view is quite large and so must be countered with more
information. i do not have the particular language nor have i
developed the understanding or framework for these dynamics as of yet,
so wrote into a realm or beyond a structure already developed and thus
encountering significant failures in approach. i.e. stating that
'concrete is only a detail' in architecture. the problem is that this
is not true in some situations, and also the word/concept 'detail' is
not the correct word for what i am trying to describe though i am not
sure what a better word would be, feature or substructure or element
or component or structure yet none of these likewise fit either.
though of course there are many who could better state the same ideas
within an improved POV with more accuracy and much more insight and
more knowledge of the issues involved.
so my approach is limited. the language also. and i equate it to is
the following mistaken viewpoint about concrete in architecture, in
special cases:  it is to assume that the sand is only a detail of the
beach. and this is largely false. it _is the beach, or a major or
significant element along with sky and water and wind and waves. it is
a major component, not minor.
and yet in most architecture the concrete involved does not take
center stage, it is another component, so it tends towards a larger
assemblage of components functioning together and is not the main
event. many times concrete is dressed by other facing materials,
skins, that shield it from the weather and provide a different facade
than CMU or precast panels and yet there are also buildings that are
just CMUs and precast walls and-or floors/ceilings. though their
significance in terms of the total building may still remain that of a
quasi-detail or more minor component or insignificant beyond just
being a barrier or boundary, such that the language may not be
explored or developed or insightful and may have inert presence, such
that it is more about 'nothing' than 'being'. say an industrial
warehouse with no windows and a simple door on an exterior that is
otherwise all concrete, with a company logo as sign.
perhaps this is not just a detail though it is also not going beyond
certain dimensionality in its functioning, it is basic and not
necessarily interwoven into other themes beyond utility, such that it
provides structure or boundary, security, enclosure, perhaps texture,
color, scale. it may be unwise to compare it straight away with a CPU
enclosure, as it relates to what is inside the box, though to some
extent this can be a disconnection or simple boundary that is already
defined in its functioning in many ways, by default, unless explored
further. and thus building is often differentiated from architecture
as it does not have this additional layer or level of investigation,
inquiry, innovation, questioning of parameters, function, beyond this.
so in some sense it is a big SIN to not have remembered epic examples
to the contrary where concrete cannot be said to be just another
element or, again wrong-worded, only a detail, as this warps its
contribution and conceptual potential that has been explored (most
notably by Le Corbusier and others). a few examples to provide
Notre Dame du Haut
[images] this chapel by Le Corbusier located in Ronchamp, France, is singularly
in concrete, it defied the existing conceptualization of how the
material could be used and likely still does. it is the determiner of
many architectural dimensions, space, massing, light, enclosure,
walls/ceiling, roof, and if memory serves the massive roof appears to
float when inside, even though made of massive concrete. thus the
gravity of the material has been reverse or inverted. this is the
height of aesthetic mastery, the language of architecture through the
medium of concrete. and more, the use of a ship analogy and metaphor,
its significance in architecture, rendered in concrete as the roof. it
is assumed also medieval fortifications which used to have walls of
several feet thick were related to concrete thickness, when such walls
were once foundation and required to be this thick, which continued
into tall buildings such as skyscrapers when supporting several floors
above them, prior to steel and concrete construction. so perhaps those
(correctly stated) details of windows refer to that earlier language
or pattern. further, there was innovation with formwork such that
textures on the formwork would transfer onto the set concrete forms,
thus revealing wood on its surface, as part of a new technique that
was developed by Le Corbusier. and so this refutes any notion of
concrete only as detail. it is the defining feature across many
dimensions and structures, it almost singularly defines the building
beyond its stained glass and wooden pews. completely captivating in
its essence, and this essence is concrete. and it is a deep
connection, deep awareness, grounding within the material as it is
made into form and functions within a myriad of different parameters.
(also, this built organic form (1954) in relation to sculpture...)
Brancusi sculpture Bird in Space (1930-40) or other
consider then another structure...
Sydney Opera House
it is iconic for its form, resembling billowing sails made of precast
concrete. having visited neither of these structures, it appears
likewise a majority of the building exterior consists of precast
concrete panels. thus another example that 'concrete is not just a
detail', which in these cases is an absurd and ignorant viewpoint,
when universalized. it is the major or prime structural component
though also the basis for conceptualization, the medium that is relied
upon and explored to express or develop such a unique language of
form, based upon the specific and unique properties of concrete in its
various techniques and approaches, many of which are invented by
architects for buildings and have never been built before. thus this
is a realm of large-scale experimentation, the limits of construction,
and daring work even.
it should be noted that recently i encountered a reference to this
building which said how beautiful it was on the outside as a concert
hall, yet the acoustics on the inside are or were horrible, and thus
the building aesthetics and its interior programmatic functionality
were not matched- though this is also why acoustic engineering exists,
which can often optimize a space in such scenarios. the difference
here is that buildings in the past, when having a main function like
'music hall' or 'opera house' were designed around acoustic properties
firstly, if not mistaken. and this is not about chance, how sound
exists in a given space in terms of its size, shape, proportion,
materiality, etc. and thus the outside-in approach, versus inside-out
approach, and how this can conflict perhaps most especially in terms
of the present day where 'image-based' buildings have their external
form as the main development or feature and functionality is presumed
to default to a usable correlated equivalency, yet can also be
hollowed out of meaning, superficial, merely about the surface and not
insightful in other realms or other substructures or components. a bit
like a building that is masquerading, and appears one way yet under
the mask is another way. like fancy aesthetic structures that are
miserable to be inside or just mediocre, yet praised for their looks
or drama, yet less livable or even dysfunctional or needy, requiring
high-maintenance, concessions by its occupants, which is its own type
of lost economy or friction that indicates peculiar approaches,
it is hard to convey how central aesthetics are to knowledge yet when
removed of its role as a grounding of philosophy, of shared belief and
truth, values, knowledge, as materialized, it then can become detached
and move into a realm of relativistic babble, greater accounting does
not take place, and images can be deceiving, illusion or manipulations
of the senses.
another realm of 'concrete is more than detail' it is
conceptualization itself is within the realm of Brutalism, a
particular movement or style in architecture...
Brutalist architecture
as should be obvious, my observations are only limited and there are
people with vast understanding who have researched these issues and
who have expertise, though some of this also is intuitive, from living
in civilization and environments where such buildings exist and define
a space, within given parameters. and I have a fondness for a local
example, at least in its appearance, which tends towards fortification
though has also been evaluated as a response to student unrest on
college campuses, an embodiment of the fortification of the
educational system against students and populations, visible in
aesthetics of built form.
Boston City Hall
so in the history books i read that defined a particular shared
consciosuness, this building is one of the main examples. and it is
implicitly 'concrete' in more than detail, it is seemingly in its
conceptual entirety, in that it melds what is material also with the
mental awareness of concrete as metaphor or analogy, as if anchoring
something into the ground, making an idea it into a tangible truth,
via securing of spatial-order vis a vis security or fortress, or
whatever. in that an underlying realm of hostility and unrest or a
different mapping of experience may better be realized or understood
in these more stark forms and encounters, as if the realm of
ubiquitous surveillence maps more readily into these aesthetics even,
then those buildings of high gloss, shiny distracting objects. in
other words, you could probably use this building for military
purposes even, or some such structures, because of their more
fortified nature than all-glass facades, and a more primal or
primitive relation could be established, more natural perhaps with the
social Darwinist/Spencerian survival of the fittest dynamics, if not
even towards a Planet of the Apes retro-futurism of some kind. again,
concrete here is more than the material, it is a larger connected
essence and its language is developed in depth.
Rarig Center for performing arts at U of Minnesota (local example)
so there is a difference in how a medium develops, in what terms and
parameters, what ideas are explored and what conceptualization is
involved. it can be contained, and thus a material could exist only as
a detail in some or many circumstances, yet in others it could become
a major or main event and take on a primary role, and become a realm
of peak inquiry and innovation. this both in terms of language and
geometry/mathematics, of structures and aesthetics, as it relates to
concepts, patterns. or it could be unquestioned and an issue of
utility, relied upon to do once again what has been provably done
before within given parameters. yet to describe all of this dynamic
range within linear strings is impossible and arbitrary, because it is
far more involved, and requires clarification for each and every error
or misconception and thus words words words to seek to repair faulty
frameworks and reasoning that is limited, bounded, to particular
constraints or points of views, etc. and thus this condition of
language could itself be the gap or mismatch with the issues of
existence, the impossibility of accurately relating to what is going
on in its ubiquity and depth within the parameters it exists within,
without being trapped in warped, distorted, and biased if not untrue
or only partially-true statements that then function as communication,
there appears no way to fix this within linear language itself. this
as it relates to code and to programming likewise. it is a trap, ideas
and concepts cannot be empirically developed within words to a degree
of fidelity required to attain 1:1 conceptual models. thus, also,
software ever disconnected from what it seeks to represent in these
same scenarios.
it is the artificial and misleading, false 'nature of things', this
language-based communication about events and seeking to model events
within signs that are linearly described, looped, versus within
molecular dimensional structures - circuits - that can actually
account for all components, elements, details and events in whatever
degree and fidelity they may exist.
one stray example arises repeatedly in my mind about the nature of
architecture as it has become detached from a larger accounting and as
this relates to core principles. it used to be a goal to have a
structure last, to endure over time, as part of the goal. today
instead planned obsolence has taken hold so buildings may stand for
only 30 years before being demolished. consider this in terms of how
it influences design, what issues are addressed and ignored, and how
much material is wasted to continue such an inefficent process that
also stands-in for development as an engine, process, or flow of
activity that circulates money around. in that it is a circuit, how
this functions.
no doubt there is aesthetic beauty in many buildings though what it
often hides is that other issues are being ignored (such as
environment, planning, social relations) and architecture can just be
about the image. perhaps like those apps that can be easily created by
putting various parts together, throwing an interface on a given
structure, yet that is not innovating beyond a particular level of
inquiry or set of relations, which then become bounded, limiting.
the following observation is not to question the legitimacy of
approach for the building in its functioning, which is built like
others by star architects all around the globe. so it is not to single
it out as an example, though it provides a case in point regarding
certain values that are taught of in school that in practice are
seemingly no longer of significant importance...
consider the birds nest stadium built for the 2008 Summer Olympics...
Beijing National Stadium
while of great beauty, there is also great dismay at the material
design involved due to issues of economy. in school they teach you of
surface area, how this relates to heating and cooling of a structure,
and how each and every joint or connection is a potential weakness,
whether for water or rust or expansion/contraction failures from
stress and strain, including between different or particular
materials. how a building is put together and funcdtions over time.
that this is part of its success or failure.
and my immediate thought or reaction really upon seeing this 'visual
structure' was the known extreme maintenance it would require over
time, in having to maintain/upkeep the 'visual structure' via
presumably paint and-or rust protection, for each angled connection
and joint and surface. perhaps it will not rust, perhaps it requires
no painting. yet if it does it is certainly non-trivial as to the way
the building functions over time. unless like most stadiums these
days, it is destroyed after 30 years time.
(in some way the detachment from larger considerations allows this
narrow 'design development' to take place in architecture, it is in
some significant way a form of luxury, yet detached from
responsibility, afforded by ignoring other vital aspects, decadent or
based in excess, disregard for economy beyond economics, as if
architecture is financialization writ large even. the embodiment of a
business philosophy detached from the surface of the earth in its
actual truthful accounting and functioning instead within parameters
of a fairy tale that is never spoken against, to sustain the illusion
or delusion that aesthetics can be primary without also securing their
foundation, connecting it with deeper truth. instead it can be
shallow, hollow, or unsteady, and may not withstand the momentums of
culture as it continues to advance or stall out over time. there is
something of a treachery involved in 'image-analysis' that lacks a
larger framework for its evaluation, and yet this has become the
guiding 'philosophy' of architecture likewise, to which students must
kneel down before such ideas as if of superior nature and awareness
versus cutting corners and in effect, cheating the discipline of its
integrity and substituting it with a lesser set of goals and ideals
that tend towards the profane instead.)
in some ways it seems that code can be like this also. that there can
be structures that are difficult to maintain or upkeep yet are
developed in a way that there is no way to sustain them over time.
tens of millions of lines of code say, that cannot simply be renovated
or simply tweaked or fixed up. it appears almost as if a prevailing
ethos of development both online and offline, in software, hardware,
and material development, processes and procedures as this maps to
business, social relations, and how knowledge exists and moves into a
particular direction, as if a kind of momentum or flow within a given
circuit whose parameters best or most optimally function in this way,
yet may not add up to more over time, and more require a limited or
bounded relation or condition for their existence. in that this
interaction or limited engagement is the nature of the material so
conceived, considered and that another system or material approach may
be required to develop other options that are not preconceived or
pre-wired into the existing approaches and "economical" methods that
can lack the foundation needed to develop cohension in other areas,
shared realms of inquiry, larger modeling or conceptualization beyond
the finite, separate, iconic isolation that becomes based and reliant
upon principles that may function against larger, longer goals, simply
by using existing approaches that have ideological functioning

@_subject: patterns & tracks (urls) 
comment: so here in the Great White North, one year all of the sudden
many people on local television were complaining about the fact that
there is snow in Minnesota. i had never heard anyone in my life
complain about snow in Minnesota, as if it was a negative event. who
are these people? when did the population get replaced? - and it
seemed that another kind of person now existed in the area who was
fundamentally not from here else did not belong, and hopefully finds a
place they like better. rather than stand in snow complaining about
so take an event X that has certain functioning and variables, that
could even be its nature, what makes it what it is (X).  thus, X=snow.
and then consider a place (MN) as being invariably tied to this
condition, such that MN=X within a certain range of parameters, say
and for many, as long as they have shelter, warm clothes and boots, it
can be an enjoyable time. if not, you may not survive. though snow and
winter have profound aesthetic value as a transformation from what is
known into another realization and understanding of the same place,
within differing parameters (light, color, temperature, clothing,
transportation, etc). so living in the north can be an education in
itself, knowing about winter, learning from it.
the larger situation is repeated elsewhere. in particular, in
educational contexts that have also migrated online as a type of
disapproval of certain natural functioning and awareness. most
notably, discussion groups online where a given [topic] will then have
limits placed upon its exploration, even though inquiries may fall
squarely within a given domain. and to this my response is similar:
who are these people, where did they come from?
for instance, the basic principles of [disciplines] such as
architecture can be censored in discussion or other areas (cultural,
technological) because it falls outside the artificial lines or
boundaries so conceived by a given ~managing population. such that
'the ideas' cannot be discussed, in their natural habitat, which
instead relies upon a definition of a place such that: place=not-X. or
in other words: topic = not-topic. insofar as it challenges a given
ideological boundary. and this can be as unnatural as believing 'snow
is bad' in Minnesota- fundamentally unnatural as a viewpoint. yet so
too, 'architecture is bad' for architecture, and onward. 'security is
bad for security' etc.
and perhaps this is evident in boundaries that are upheld and
constructed, maintained, such that certain issues and ideas cannot be
discussed due to enforcement of limits, and these may not have
anything to do with secrecy via NDA and instead, of wrong ideas and
thinking that challenge the status quo interpretation and belief
system (religion as state, essentially), yet that substitutes a
condition of truth with another, a pseudo-version that is fake, unreal
by comparison, and yet upheld as the basis for relation and exchange.
in that, having a negative view of snow in Minnesota, at least for me
and those i have known, is going against what makes this place what it
is, in its depth and connection with the area. and viewing 'ideas' as
negative that have this connection with a given topic or
understanding, likewise, unnatural and out-of-place. indicative of
other dissonance, ungrounded relations. to forbid 'ideas' of crypto
within discussion of cryptography, poo-pooing it, for instance, would
be an interesting realm to consider for how deep this disconnection
could go, thus revealing a surface relation or deception reliant upon
the not-X condition to sustain itself, or in this case, the need for
insecurity, obscurity, unknowing, disconnection, as vital to the ruse.
all such betrayels of truth reveal themselves in how truth is related
to, observed or ignored.
consider in this context, then, how might the government ever combat
issues of 'cyberspace' if its relation with electromagnetism was never
allowed to be established; such that:
     cyberspace = not-EM
on NSA interview on 60 minutes: it was stated that the interconnection
between various computer analysis systems (metadata) was needed to get
the 'whole picture', in that it is necessary to engage the situation
at the scale it exists. without this, conceptual blindness due to
limits or boundaries that prevent greater understanding of how things
now consider an entire university system, education system down to
gradeschool, that is forbidden from uniting its metadata beyond
compartmented views. that is essentially the condition today that
enforces illiteracy and makes it impossible to reason about advanced
situations beyond finite language games:
      culture = not-EM
everything that is connected via electromagnetism, and
interdisciplinary via shared structure and order of truth, is denied
by its lack of inclusion, allowance, and validation by authority - and
get this: on the basis for superior (private) belief based upon what
amounts to religious opinion, that instead censors truth so that this
wider viewpoint cannot be established. leave it up to some girls in
gradeschool to challenge the paradigm on a science project, the very
situation that cannot be addressed through reason otherwise, due to
issues of power.
the NSA gets its integrated metadata. the citizens and education
system does not. this is to include EMF hazards and electropollution
in relation to telecoms and telephony, etc. what about metadata of

for instance, you could take any appliance or artifact and map it out,
back to previous dynamics, say a ice box compared to e-refrigerator,
or iron heated on fire to electric iron, its relation to laundry room of
washing machine and dryer. how these effected social roles, etc.

it should also be mentioned that this type of 'feedback' is potentially
possible and valuable in any work or routine process, where it could
function in more or less efficient or effective ways. and this can be
connected to individual lives or managerial issues within companies
that either allow for such local perspective or seek a top-down model
where the viewpoint and ideas only originate from a given vantage,
and this could distinguish an intelligent and adaptive organization
from a rigid approach that is stuck in time and ultimately overtaken
by others innovation- thus relation of processes and functioning
with business philosophy, application of principles, their mediation
that can have economic, social, political effects, un-shared beliefs, &c.
(for instance, a worker in a production process has insight into how it
is and is not effective and can offer feedback for tweaks, improvement
or not allowing this and having that inefficiency/ineffectiveness built-in
and then normalized, including as relational ideology, that can limit the
engagement with the situation or force disengagement, detachment.
in other word, testable hypotheses of flow and routine functioning or
are these unquestioned and enforced to uphold given social relation)
likewise, what may appear only commonsense today - having enough
room to maneuver in the kitchen and use appliances effectively - can
extend as a conceptual question into the present and future day, such
as how the pantry, kitchen, and e-commerce in an automated scenario.
this was part of the idea for the Asperger Management System (AMS),
whereby a home computer system (data furnace) would use A.I. to bid
on restocking pantry, perhaps even in a financial market sense, where
'group bids' for a local community could exist to purchase wholesale,
and so an exchange could develop and suppliers to fill the contracts.
this would then integrate the 'intelligent refrigerator' with pantry,
and then have an A.I. data furnace device manage routine orders,
based on patterns that could include weather, past price history.
and of course a dwelling would need a way to store/allow packages
when people are away from home, to allow deliveries at any time.
note here the vital role of both encryption and security protocols.
(this leading to how existing courier/shipping services function, in
that people can wait all day for an e-commerce shipment to arrive
when instead an e-commerce portal or secure drop box could exist,
and before that, wireless updates when a driver is on their way to
a destination, providing a 30 minute window or lead-time vs. 8 hrs

@_subject: PVDF and you - (01) 
so i have been researching PVDF piezo film sensors
via a technical manual [0] and there is a lot here that
may be of potential interest in terms of its applications,
[1] especially its use in security systems and to prevent
tampering, and energy harvesting, in addition to other
areas where its unique functionality could be explored.
what follows, a series of short posts about this material...
0a. Measurement Specialties PVDF technical manual (PDF)
0b. technical manual with Appendix of piezo film articles
1. Measurement Specialties Piezo Film Product Guide
so PVDF is 'piezo film' that has unique properties and
capabilities. while i know little of functional electronics,
it is said to be a capacitor that stores and discharges
high voltage energy. like a piezo disk it picks up the
vibrational energy due to structural deformation that
then generates or moves charge in response to this.
the application i recently first encountered it was with
'contact microphones' - where it was stated that these
PVDF film tab mics record the vibrations as sound input
rather than acoustic pressure of condenser and dynamic
capsule microphones reliant on soundwaves moving the air.
so the distinction is that this piezo film can function as
a recording input or SENSOR though by registering the
vibrations on the surface of a material. what is more, it
also detects temperature differences and thus can be
employed as a sensor this way as well, which i did not
realize was possible nor expect for a 'microphone'.
the PVDF film apparently is already used in security
applications within computers, if not crypto systems
protected from tampering, via vibration sensing that
triggers lock down or equipment destruction based
upon monitoring of piezo film signals at perimeter.
PVDF film for Tamper-Proofing, Security (white paper)
(interesting likewise is use of piezo coaxial cable for
perimeter security, strung on fencing as a microphone
and also buried underground, which then can register &
record raindrops, footsteps, people climbing fence, etc.)

@_subject: energy harvesting via PVDF - (02) 
okay, so the big surprise for me was that this piezo film
technology lines up directly with an energy harvesting
article from a recent (urls) list. excerpted again below:

@_date: 2013-12-19 16:34:01
@_author: brian carroll 
@_subject: PVDF as antenna - (03) 
from this vantage of not-knowing, and having experimented
some with breadboards and the Parallax Basic Stamp
microcontroller platform, it would again seem possible
that if the PVDF were conceptualized as an antenna that
when it is geometrically aligned does not just access a
realm of signals, and instead, this signal is itself energy
that correlates directly with a capturing of voltage within
the piezo film as capacitor, such that an 'energy antenna'
exists and perhaps this is the basis of energy harvesting,
though seemingly is bounded by how it is implemented.
in that its application appears to be requiring mechanical
energy, affixed to a surface which bends the material as
the basis for vibration, than tuning into a frequency that
is detached from the sensor and yet resonates it via the
correspondence and alignment of shared tuning (A=A),
and in this way motivates charge within a larger circuit.
so there are whitepapers that exist about self-sustaining
circuits based on PVDF and microcontrollers [0] and yet
nothing in this other realm about the 'global AC circuit' [1]
as this could also influence movement of the antenna in a
framework beyond that of sidewalks and HVAC vibrations.
in that atmospheric electricity and the earth-ionosphere
cavity [2] have fundamental relation to EM technologies
thus, stating the obvious in an expanded view beyond
that of a compartmentalized realm, this condition of being
within such an environment, yet not having it understood
or conceptualized based upon a false limit or no-go zone,
as if fringe to consider or perhaps not obvious to those
without instruction, the educational system enforcing a
fundamental disconnection, as if to keep everything that
is naturally connected apart, as if somehow beyond limits
thus basic electromagnetic awareness, to then read the
technical manual [3] where it states the following:
"Although the forces involved are small, the film can be used to
excite other mechanical structures over a very wide frequency range.
If a second element of film is used to receive the induced vibration,
the system can possess a very high dynamic range, even though the
overall "insertion loss" due to the film is about -66 dB typically for
a structure at resonance. If sufficient gain is applied between these
elements, the structure will self-oscillate at its natural frequency.
For these resonant mechanical systems, high voltage drive is not
required. The amplifier circuit may function adequately from a normal
dual rail op-amp supply, or even from a single 9 volt battery. For
analysis purposes, even lower applied voltages, e.g., the noise source
of a spectrum analyzer at 70 mVrms, are sufficient to insert the
mechanical energy into a structure when piezo film is also used to
monitor the result." (p.5)
now consider again the issue of tuning and shared resonance,
that the movement of one object at a certain vibration/frequency
could induce another object to also vibrate at that frequency if
the resonance was shared or tuned similarly.
thus, a PVDF film 'transmitting antenna' could seemingly generate
a vibration at a given frequency, and if matched to anther PVDF film
as receiving antenna, could induce it to vibrate and in effect, transfer
or transmit the power from one circuit into another, via this vibration.
i.e. resonance-based transfer of energy, or remote power generation
so you could place a microcontroller antenna tuned to a frequency
a few feet from another, on a separate circuit, and seemingly then
light up its LEDs via vibrational energy, no electromagnetism that
spans this gap, and instead resonance or vibration as the medium.
(note: non-acoustic seemingly because it is the material itself that
is vibrating and not "acoustic" air pressure pushing it to vibrate.)
note: in this way it is clean, non-pollutive, and nonradiating energy
and this is what Tesla had discovered apparently, and yet it was not
able to be developed further, given the all-encompassing situation.
and yet, listening to the stories of hh, she conveys that Tesla who
had developed alternating current infrastructure thought in retrospect
that it was unnatural and harmful as an energy approach, and that
this resonance-based energy was based upon natural cosmic order,
and was correctly aligned with life and nature, not functioning against
it via invisible toxic pollution of radiation and its massive inefficiencies.
so now there are two major themes: one is energy capture via the
Schumann Resonance, and another is non-electromagnetic transfer
of power via antennas tuned to a shared frequency, whereby current
from one circuit could induce it in another. this is different from the
magnetic induction whereby magnetic fields bridge the gap between
transmitter and receiving device, and any electric or electromagnetic
version likewise, whereby current is bridging this gap, ionizing the
air inbetween, breaking down the structure of the air to move energy,
versus nontoxic vibrating at some imperceptible infrastructural layer
that is already active within nature, which all entities are attuned to
as part of a living ecosystem and circuit, yet also out of harmony and
out of balance via technology and development in the present moment,
with populations unable to grasp the hostile situation we exist within,
environmentally, ecologically, educationally, intellectually, realistically
in the dimensions & parameters that exist, for optimal decision-making
what then if the approach or conceptualization is off, and equipment
and tools exist for experimentation like early days of electrification,
where hobbyists can turn inventors and transform the situation by
exploring beyond the edge already defined, via new interpretations
or accessing old, discarded ideas and knowledge, thinking it through
once again, and perhaps massive discoveries await via such experiment

@_subject: tuning piezo antenna - (4) 
basically at this juncture there are questions of piezo film itself,
and then how to control this within a circuit, which could also
involve information transfer, and thus microcontroller platforms
are probably involved in such experimentation and development.
so how i approach this situation is that i look at what is available
for piezo film sensors, and contemplate how that plastic-coated
piezo film could be made to vibrate automatically or function as
a non-radiating transceiver of 'resonance-based' energy as signal.
and thus the options are basically for little rectangle tabs of film
that plug into a breadboard circuit of a microcontroller or else can
be soldered to a circuitboard, as with various other approaches. [0]
e.g. the DT Series from Measurement Specialties is the same type
of strain-gage sensor found in contact microphones. [1] though i was
still completely puzzled by another version of this element that has
a round metal opening in its otherwise flat surface as if a mistake
occurred at the hardware store. as if a pierced PVDF sensor. [2]
and then after a google search i happened upon a experimenter
who built an Arduino Seismic Activity Monitor [3] using the same
PVDF element and it was then realized the hole in the piezo tab
related to its use as a cantilever that vibrates and that additional
weights can be added to limit what frequencies influence it, thus
the antenna can be tuned to respond to only certain frequencies,
or in the larger consideration, potentially to resonate in a narrow
window where it could be specifically tuned to, say- 7.83 Hz, if
indeed it either could be manufactured this way as an antenna
or retrofitted via weights or modifications. or so it seems possible.
in other words, having once had access to a seismic sensor, the
range in which the vibrations would trigger the circuit could be
fine-tuned to a certain limited parameter which could potentially
influence inefficiency or limit any outside involvement, harmonics
from powerlines or ambient noise that could lessen or disrupt the
clean or predominant movement, seemingly. like only having one
vibration versus several that counteract and diminish one another,
though perhaps in some cases harmonics could be beneficial and
in others counteract the movement. those who know would know.
(sidenote: interesting to consider precisely because such a sensor
can still be used as a microphone element and could be tuned or
adjusted to pick up stray signals or vibrations from the environment,
say the 60 cycle hum of alternating current, more on this later..)
so, tuning of the adjustable PVDF film tab apparently involves
either guesswork or use of an oscilloscope, which i wish i knew
how to use because it seems the conceptual foundation of the
diagnostics of electronics and circuits, how to relate to and
understand them in detail and without it, the multimeter in its
non-graphic approach remains to me an issue of numbers only,
never having understood how all of it fits together as a worldview.
though it is evident that it is possible to put weights onto this
cantilever of the sensor and then measure it so that it only can
vibrate within a certain wavelength, or frequency, in this case it
was bounded for earthquake sensing, to a lower range and thus
filtering out all the higher frequencies that could influence if not
trigger the sensor, said to be extremely sensitive to vibrations,
otherwise. what this amounts to is: if you know electronics and
know circuits and have an oscilloscope, you could probably tune
the antenna to a particular frequency range, whether to transmit
or receive crypto data as infrasound (seems unlikely as transmit,
though receive apparently a-ok, if material connection is vibration,
again not acoustic or in air; thus computer chassis, cables, etc)
or at ultrahigh frequencies (transmit/receive seemingly both ok.)
thus perhaps someone with the know-how to see if it is actually
possible to transmit data via resonance-based vibration, where
movement is induced in another circuit, becoming power for that
circuit, else also transmit data via non-electromagnetic means,
on the principle of shared tuning. (there is more to this, opening
up and tapping into the infinity of a circuit, and somehow having
this drive the vibration of the PVDF ((which is more 'the aether'
from what i understand, not of this dimensionality)) though that
is for some other investigation, in some other time and place.
this involves challenging existing mathematics of zero, etc.)
in any case, the point here is that there could be multiple ways
of tuning the piezo film as an antenna within these parameters,
and it could involve differing approaches or circuits to do so.

@_subject: PVDF & microcontrollers - (5) 
it is already established my skills do not allow exploration of
these issues though i have some basic observations to share
about what exists based on web searches that may quicken
research for those interested who are new to PVDF sensors.
first observation is that a development kit exists for those who
have knowledge and interest and want to start experimenting,
[0] though it does not appear to include cantilever hole designs
of the sensor, that was mentioned in terms of tuning antennas.
still, it could be useful for exfiltrating data or capturing signals
sent via infra- or ultrasound, and also has a large film element
that has been used as a speaker in various online demos. for
instance, seemingly you could wire up a PVDF sensor along-
side computer chassis and monitor signals via its vibrations,
or powersupply, perhaps keyboard or keystrokes or whatnot.
likewise, power various tools via energy harvesting of these
same approaches else discover free-energy approach based
in shared resonance not coupled to another material beyond
the antenna itself if tuned to a primary and matched source.
it seems Arduino and other microcontroller platforms are for
those already saavy in programming and they and other such
programmable integrated circuit platforms represent a large
population of developers, professionals, experimenters, and
hobbyists, and other enthusiasts. this seems equivalent in
kind to the early era of electronics with crystal radio kits
occurring in an engineering centric culture that grew into
the early computer industry via ham radio experimenters,
and those who mail ordered and constructed electronic kits,
today involving the internet, online stores, discussion boards
in the realm of advanced computing, everyone having their
own programmable 'computer-based' development platform,
and a tremendous kit of parts to choose from, to further explore.
including ideas, goals, projects, hypotheses, prototypes, etc.
the reason for stating this is that a certain level of literacy may
exist for many who are computer literate in the advanced sense
of a cypherpunks context, knowing hardware and software and
ideas beyond this, into mathematics and linguistic concepts,
and so a high-fidelity understanding and awareness may exist
that enables greater ease of use within the ready-to-program
devices that have limited documentation, and can present a
large learning curve for those starting without such experience.
thus, straight-away to mention that Sparkfun [1] carries various
PVDF sensors, example, that can then be added into whatever
microcontroller may exist capable of interfacing with the sensor.
the thing is, in researching this, it appears there is potentially
limited data for people just starting out, for how to go about this,
whereas those already fluent may know how to put it all together.
apparently instructions can be lacking and this is mentioned with
respect to another approach for those like myself who need more
step-by-step instructions and learning tutorials to know what to
do and how to think about things, to build up awareness via
making circuits on the microcontroller versus using it for an
already determined objective. and there are general kits to do
this for Arduino, in particular a 37 module sensor kit [2], so it
is potentially an experimenter's paradise, if knowing how to get
everything functioning, having a plan and enough information.
i do not know enough about Arduino to know other competitors
in the same domain though it appears there are many others
(Beagleboard, etc) so that was used just as an example of
several different options that exist where these piezo sensors
can be integrated into the existing programmable platform,
to custom-build and craft circuits, as is already being done.
(note: if i am using 'platform' in the wrong way, my apologies,
it is the nearest word i know of to describe these tools)
so essentially it is a 'nothing new here' situation for those who
know all about this technology, though potentially to question
the potential for a piezo film sensor beyond existing boundaries
and perhaps for advanced unmentioned cryptologic applications.
the issue then is to question an electronic component, this
piezo film tab as vibrational cantilever, the piezo element that
exists beyond the circular disk and functions in other territory
and in other configurations, including also piezo coaxial cable
(and again, its potential use as an antenna of other dynamics)
and so, for instance, the datasheets are included on some of
the urls below, to provide more information if interested in
evaluating if the given parameters may allow experimentation
within the realms considered, say detecting signals patterns
via vibrational 'contact' versus acoustic microphone. [3]
so that is perhaps the majority approach for those already
up to speed, though everyone may not have the same approach
or others may want to learn about this, and thus a programmable
microcontroller platform I have successfully learned from before,
both about electronics and software programming of breadboard
circuits is the Parallax BASIC Stamp Activity Kit [4]. essentially
it is a platform for educating people about microcontrollers and
provides an indepth tutorial and various circuits as part of a kit,
and support forums for experimenters and developers, as with
Arduino, which may have its own 'learn electronics' kit, though
it seems Parallax has focused on this educational sector and
providing materials for schoolchildren, hobbyists, and up, to the
professional sector prototyping and development solutions, so
is perhaps unique in its tutorial or hands-on learning approach
versus what may require additional instruction else a different
more self-guided approach otherwise, with other pathways.
(trying to be fair, not advertise, yet also provide information
about the offerings. also: if other PVDF vendors, they are few
or do not have information i could locate in repeated searches)
this is why I mention the Parallax kit that includes a fundamental
course in learning circuits via a programmable breadboard. this
same PVDF sensor [5] can be used with this platform, and it
also has additional data on the commands related to it as part
of a User Guide for that specific tutorial approach, [6] in that it
may provide more structure than other less structured approaches
though perhaps this is more related to the overall framework of
learning to use a microcontroller itself, where for some a more
all encompassing approach may be required prior to interfacing
with the PVDF in terms of programming functioning of a circuit.
and likewise, following this same general theme, the Sensors
Sampler Pack for the Parallax BASIC Stamp microcontroller
includes a PVDF element along with other sensor options. [7]
the reason for providing examples is to see what is out there
for those learning, in individual components and then within an
integrated approach, of which there are various routes to take.
for instance, consider the following project:
Phoenix Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor Project
Sub-project: Piezo Film Pulse Sensor
if someone already knows what they are doing, competent in
the domains of hardware and microcontroller programming, it
would probably be fairly likely they could replicate or learn from
this demonstration of use for a PVDF sensor. yet further, someone
with an interest in cryptography or crytanalysis, could potentially
take this same information and apply the pulse reading to the
chassis of a computer to monitor vibrational activity or apply
this same information in some other way, in terms of security
analysis, exploits, defense, research, exploration, experiment.
though someone who does not have this knowledge then may
be stuck, unless a step-by-step approach exists, which is more
the Parallax approach, and perhaps in some ways Arduinio if
online tutorials exist in place of paper manuals, though these
extra layers of information may be required prior to achieving
such finished projects, and needs to be built-up as a skill first.
but not everything that is involved in this situation is about
technology of computer hardware and software, and the code
can go beyond computing, even 'electrons' potentially, in terms
of what the situation could be modeled as, via its parameters.
in that the PVDF as tunable antenna is not unlike a tuning fork
that is made to resonate by another paired vibration, and while
it may appear this is acoustic energy, air pressure, it could be
the resonance of the material itself that is set to vibrate due to
its physics, its particular construction and composition. that is,
as with Helen Hall and her study of music physics, that what
this involves relates to the issue of a vibrating string, and the
'energy' issues of vibration can be conceptualized likewise in
terms of music principles, such that the resonance as it now
is conceived of may not exist within computing in the way it
is known in music, for instance, yet it may have importance
in terms of harvesting energy via non-acoustic vibrations.
i do not myself understand what this involves enough to better
introduce to topic, though to hh it is 'the Art of Frequencies',
as this relates to music physics and music and energy. the
reason it is mentioned is that sympathetic vibrations occur
in a paired matching or alignment (1:1) and (A=A) in terms
of logic, within my own research, and in this way especially
in terms of 'consciousness', each person their own antenna,
and how they relate to others and in what ways. a common
example could be sexual dynamics and 'magnetic fields', in
that a certain pressure or boundary may be encountered via
anther that either attracts or repels or is perhaps neutral. in
this framework, there is something tied into the materiality
of encounter, the physical body and its relation to another,
other as self or unlike self, as this constitutes circuitry.
further, though, beyond or outside a realm of push & pull
of both magnetic and electromagnetic polarity, it also can
potentially include something 'outside' this EM boundary,
in that a non-electromagnetic energy of vibration could
also exist -- as if in the realm of information itself -- that
maps onto these same connections as 'shared tuning'
(all mention of tuning has origin with HH, in my work).
so what this is to suggest is that this inductive sensing
of humans, this mapping of awareness of self and others,
could be occurring as information in this vibrational way,
if connecting 'dots' across various views and approaches,
and thus how people are tuned or out of tune may relate
to what signals they pick up or what movements they are
part of, as grounded within certain dimensions, dynamics,
self as circuit, then relation with others into groups, etc.
and this is also the PVDF antenna model, seemingly.
potentially. the only substitution i would suggest is that
that 'global electrical current' that could set everything into
a shared time and framework of connected circuitry, would
be in some sense an analogy of empirical truth that flows
into the shared macrocircuit and people are aligned by it.
thus, induction beyond electromagnetism, though also
as a pressure, perhaps, the pneumatic aspect, and the
larger cosmological question of 'strings' that may be of
an informational category, in terms of cosmic vibration
that is defined by resonance of each and every object,
if not mistaken in relaying others knowledge involved.
in other words, consciousness could be modeled by
this circuit in terms of information transfer as it also
could have an energetic component yet this approach
could exist outside or beyond the current conception
of the body in both nonexistent electromagnetic terms
and also, non-existence non-electromagnetic terms
functioning outside this electromagnetic framework,
in the sense that aetheric order could exist beneath
the existing dimensional space, this described as a
vortex model of the atom, as it relates to zero. [8]
so the potential, should a vibration on an antenna
transform into harnessing free energy - via resonance
and this new PVDF film sensor technology - then its
significance is also conceptual, beyond perhaps the
issues of creating a vibrating cantilever or pendulum
in a watch that removes the need for a battery or for
winding, due to being tuned to frequency of the earth
that becomes part of its circuit, its power source, via
this connectivity based upon natural order, its circuit
as ecosystem and habitat, context for technology.
and how this moves into modeling of self as a being,
an entity, modeling of information in relation to energy
and matter, in terms of music and physics principles,
and how it recontextualizes questions and parameters
were it to be unlocked as a common framework within
which people relate or decide to disallow its existence
i only saw the first two parts of Atlas Shrugged, a recent
television movie version, never having read the longer book
by Ayn Rand, though it seems to be based upon this same
premise, where another world exists outside the ordinary
realm, having cracked open the threshold allowing access
to other dimensionality. the third part of the film is to be
released in the next summer, apparently. in any case,
interesting times ahead if this is indeed possible...

with another strategy related to this and more information. thanks

@_author: brian carroll 
@_subject: PVDF strategies - (06) 
a general situation and condition has been described,
relating piezo film (PVDF) with issues of free energy
and also 'non-electromagnetic' if not 'non-acoustic'
transfer of power and perhaps information likewise.
yet there is a problem encountered as mentioned,
regarding challenges to achieving an ~8 Hz vibration
at the given scale, which may be an issue connected
with do-it-yourself approaches versus a manufacturing
approach, and the technological tools and equipment
available to investigate these dynamics at the scale
of breadboards, microcontrollers, and PVDF elements.
can the existing 'size' of an PVDF electronic component
actually register the approximate ~8 Hz vibration of the
Schumann resonance?
from what i have read in the technical manual (p.2), the
piezo film material is capable of registering vibration at
this frequency [1] and in fact is so sensitive in its use
as in contact microphone applications that shielding is
required to reduce unwanted vibrations [2] in a context
of 'vibration sensing' which also applies when attached
to music instruments [3]. with this in mind, it appears
that the PVDF film element is hypersensitive to any
vibration depending on the surface it is attached to.
in other words, if there is an ~8 Hz vibration occurring,
it would seem likely if not probable that the PVDF film
tab is potentially capable of sending it, given enough
knowledge and whatever equipment required to do so.
so enough of the hypotheticals, i may have forgotten
to emphasize if not mention an important observation.
several weeks ago there was an (urls) list sent that
had information about a NOVA science program that
just aired on Public Television (PBS) in the U.S. and
i saw the last 20 minutes or so of that show, as was
conveyed on that post. [4] [5] the expert interviewed
for the program, Earle R. Williams [6] mentioned the
Global AC Circuit and described research occurring
in a rural Rhode Island experiment that has been
studying this for decades, based on groundbreaking
ideas of a previous researcher who pioneered the field
of atmospheric electricity.
and what Mr. Williams said and demonstrated in this
interview was astonishing to hear. basically, if memory
serves: any antenna on earth picks up this frequency
of the Schumann resonance, which he said was ~8 Hz.
(presumably equates to 'metal antennas' i am guessing,
of the kind found on radios and televisions.)
the very interesting aspect about this, 'context' as it were,
is that this research hut for atmospheric electricity was
old technology -- basically an antenna in a very remote area
to minimize electromagnetic interference (EMI) from what is
the buzzing infrastructure of wired and wireless civilization.
the other aspect is that Mr. Williams stated, if remembering,
that all that is needed is an antenna and oscilloscope to
verify the signal is there. meaning: get a metal antenna,
have it grounded or whatever is necessary, and then attach
it to a visual feedback system and locate the 8 Hz signal.
"spikes" that occur within the signal, atop the frequency
of the Schumann resonance, are lightning strikes. as if
the earth-ionosphere cavity may have some aspect of an
echo chamber (my phrasing), though also it was stated,
again, if remembering correctly, that lighting strikes can
travel up to 2.5 times around the earth, which feeds this
resonance and supports and sustains this wavelength
that is vibrating on all antennas everywhere the same.
so in some sense these are clues, signs of what exists,
what the parameters are. people who know how to use
an oscilloscope and basic antenna are that much closer
to the issue than those who do not, and likewise, those
who can program a microcontroller and write code, etc.
so incorporating this as additional information into the
existing approach and ideas, along with helpful feedback
that questions the starting investigation in its parameters,
it seems possible that experimentation could begin within
a PVDF film sensor context, if having the tools, technology,
and ideas to shape and evaluate and test these conditions.
though further, it is also probable that specifically designing
a PVDF sensor for this particular application would be the
more direct investigation. both approaches could be viable.
in other words, the as-is approach relying on existing
piezo sensors could yield some interesting and unexpected
discoveries, and perhaps break this open into another realm.
and so how to do that is a question: how to tune the element,
how to approach it, what are the actual issues involved, etc.
for instance, consider the PVDF film itself as a rectangle
that can register vibrations via touching a vibrating surface;
this versus having the PVDF film itself resonate, vibrating
based on its being a quasi free-standing antenna. these
different approaches both could potentially access 8 Hz
though via different strategies and frameworks.
my assumption is is that rectangle of the sensor itself
is capable of picking up 'multiple frequencies' at a given
time, depending on what exists as a signal. and thus, if
in a musical approach, it may have 'multiple tunings' even
that coexist on the vibrating surface, whether freestanding
or registering movement from an attached vibrating surface.
and so the issue can be of filtering these signals to focus
the sensor into a given range. and how this is done could
effect its 'efficiency' in terms of energy collection, because
a stronger versus weaker signal could exist, if muddled by
others that counteract its pendulum-like wave movement. if
this way, dampening of the vibration via weights may allow
no movement in certain frequencies, whereas a software
filter could only edit them out while they still exist as an
active force, perhaps removing energy from or competing
with a given frequency or signal from the wanted range.\
so capturing different frequencies simultaneously (good
for crypto and energy harvesting, perhaps) vs. focusing on
a given range (better for Schumann resonance seemingly)
and yet here's the thing--
like a drum skin, how is this elusive jabberwocky of the
Schumann resonance of ~8 Hz ever going to be accessed
if it cannot be readily encountered. what can capture that
wave vibration, at that particular very long wavelength. and
(due to no memory, i get to ask such rhetorical questions)
this is what triggered my memory about the antennas, that
all antennas vibrate at this frequency, or so the expert said.
though also, considering the drum approach, this then got
me thinking- instead of a free standing 'energy antenna',
would it not be possible to use a PVDF sensor to measure
and also pick up this 8 Hz vibration on an antenna instead?
in that if the antenna is vibrating at 8 Hz, could this vibration
be 'harvested' and establish mechanical vibration in these
highly sensitive piezo films, to then build up AC current in
via their capacitance, building up and storing this charge...
in other words: PVDF + ~8 Hz antenna freq. => energy
if there were no limits to exploration and equipment could
be used to custom manufacture prototypes for this purpose,
what would an antenna look like that vibrates only at this
targeted frequency... and thus, another strategy could
involve custom manufacture of the piezo film element,
such that its surface has an antenna etched onto it,
that is made to vibrate at the Schumann resonance,
for instance a particular geometry, grid, array, pattern.
i have read about antennas and they are based upon
geometric proportion to the wavelength, so 'size' does
not necessarily correlate to frequency in terms of larger
antennas for bigger wavelengths, (if i am not mistaken).
instead, the issue of alignment between a signal and
an antenna involves a matched or paired geometrical
structure that can effectively map signals onto antennas
and then coherently deliver this signal into a circuit. likely
as cleanly and crisply as is possible, mathematics then
determining these models and design approaches. thus,
fractal antennas are an area where 'scale' is exampled
other than a yagi or dipole. and cellphones in particular
appear to make very tiny antennas or utilize unique
approaches to make them invisible even, via how the
device is grounded and where the wires are hidden,
perhaps related to signal strength and also 'length'.
so in some sense, maybe size and scale do matter
and in some sense maybe size and scale are not the
most critical factors in given applications. maybe a
larger power source requires a larger antenna and
smaller applications only need smaller antennas.
what i want to convey is that this 'etched on' approach
where an antenna structure could be engineered onto
the piezo film surface -- (such that it would vibrate at
the given frequency and then stress the sensor, in
turn generating power via its constant movement) --
has correlation with a circuit - perhaps soldertrace,
that is the antenna. so imagine a rectangle with a
single loop of a given geometry that would somehow
function as a single-frequency antenna and vibrate,
and thus stress/strain, compression/decompression
of that metal structure would flex the piezo film that
it is attached to, and be designed to maximize the
surface area with this specific tuned geometry that
can focus in on just those signals or vibrations, as
simple as an anode and cathode attached to it, yet
if correlating other approaches, perhaps etched to
a nanosurface-level with fractal patterns even that
could maximize voltage, if possible, or increase
capacitance or whatever else may be optimized
for energy harvesting of ~8 Hz signal vibrations.
so, to simplify, imagine 'the cantilever' that is the
concept already for the piezo film tab, a rectangle
that moves back and forth on axis, and in doing so
creates and stores charge that then can be dumped
into a circuit, bit by bit if momentary, and seemingly
constant alternating current if the signal is constant.
the additional etched pattern atop the sensor, this
being an additional layer, could be considered 'the
antenna' for accessing Schumann resonance. yet,
it could also be conceptualized as a cantilever that
is in addition to the piezo device itself, also this.
my vagueness here is not intentional, trying to write
into a particular direction and context whereby this
'tuned antenna' atop a cantilever instead becomes
this cantilever via a different manufacturing process,
whereby the PVDF device is itself tuned to ~8 Hz,
& moreso, perhaps taking on the form of cantilever.
such that, the piezo elemen becomes a tuning fork
that is tuned for this specific vibrational frequency,
and then anode/cathode, into associated circuitry
precedent, and note 'the scale' here, is with MEMs
devices and micromachines and nanoscale devices
where such extreme miniature 'antennas' can already
be constructed and vibrate at known frequencies, and
they take on the form of a cantilever (same functioning
as energy harvesting sensors, as vibrating pendulums)
and thus micro and nano radios can be made and
other devices, where under microscope a furious
activity is observed of what is basically a tuning fork
that is naturally vibrating via its 'tuned resonance',
(if not mistaken in interpretation of these events).
so at this unobservable visual scale, little cantilevers
can be made to vibrate via their tuning, and function
essentially the same as cantilevers that at this scale
are not envisioned or conceptualized to auto-vibrate
via paired resonance. why is that i wonder, (embargo
on thoughts, experiment, or secret domain perhaps)
just consider a watch, the mechanisms required to
wind and keep the watch spinning its intricate gears,
as this relates to pendulum movement. now what if
a cantilever existed that could vibrate automatically
at ~8 Hz, and thus no more batteries, solar cell, nor
wind-up mechanisms would be needed to provide the
motive power need for its clockwork movement. and
in this way, likewise- the cantilever is the antenna.
the concept of the sensor as mechanical cantilever
in its multiuse form, instead being reimagined as a
tuned rectangle with additional layer of antenna, this
as cantilever, or further, no rectangle and instead the
PVDF is made into a cantilever, tuning fork vibrating
at the frequency of the Schumann resonance, and in
this way, potentially replacing batteries given the size
of the cantilever and its effectiveness or efficiency.
another way to consider this in terms of electronics
and circuits is the (radio again) crystal oscillator that
is included as a stand-alone timing device, matched to
a particular frequency, lets say ~8 Hz for example...
as i understand it, electrical current in a circuit - say
involving resistors, capacitors, relays, switches, and
wires on a prototyping breadboard - moves throughout
this maze of components and can send electrons into
the crystal oscillator, a timing device, that is activated
by this electricity and generates a particular frequency
in response to its being electrified, formatting resulting
output as a given frequency, here 8 Hz, back into the
circuit, where it could be used say by an IC chip that
uses it to count cycles that trigger other activity, say
an LED display that moves up a number every million
cycles and continually counts 0-9 and starts over again.
so the idea here is that this electronics component is
partly doing what the PVDF sensor is, only in reverse.
what the crystal "quartz" oscillator does is vibrate at
a particular frequency (~8 Hz) which is the goal, and
this is already achieved in a device related in some
way already to piezo sensors (see: quartz). the main
difference is that it requires external energy to generate
the signal or the vibrations, (though if it were tuned to
~8 hz, might it vibrate without any external power?)...
     energy (in) ==> crystal oscillator ==> 8 Hz vibration (out)
to put it another way, in terms of active concepts...
     electricity ==> vibration ==> timing
in other words, in traditional radio or other timing circuits
reliant upon crystal oscillators, electrical current (power)
is input into the component that then "vibrates" at a given
frequency, and then this signal is output as 'time' into the
circuit, whereby the electrical current has this geometric
patterning mapped into its structure which is then utilized
by related or connected components, to format other action.
what the piezo film sensor does is exactly the opposite:
    timing ==> vibration ==> electricity
it takes some regular mechanical vibration when attached
to a surface, and this vibration strains the sensor which in
turn generates electrical charge via piezo electric properties
and then stores this charge via its capacitance, which then
can be output into the connected circuitry as AC electrical
current. the main issue appears to focus upon controlling
the timing or frequency, via TUNING the device (that is,
creating a cantilever or antenna to automatically vibrate)
in other words, if the 'timing' between the PVDF or other
piezo sensor and the Schumann resonance could be
established, matched in shared resonance (A=A) such
that the 8 Hz signal would directly map to an antenna
or cantilever structure tuned specifically for 8 Hz, then:
    matched-timing ==> perpetual vibration ==> free electricity
where 'matched-timing' is pairing of signal with antenna
of the piezo sensor (cantilever or not) in that the geometry
is aligned (A=A) which then accesses and sustains this
connection of 8 Hz vibration via 'shared resonance' that is
a transfer of energy from the earth/ionosphere cavity, to
the surface of the earth. the critical issue appears to be
~adjustable tuning of an antenna to allow for drift, such
that "tuning" differences both small (Aa=Ab) and large
(A=B) can be adjusted for, which also occurs in a realm
of electronics and watchmaking, if not mistaken, that an
additional level of fine-tuning and adjustkbility is involved
and required in such intricate small scale technological
if other ecosystems, because variances may exist/persist
does this mean also that a crystal oscillator [7] is a step
or two away from providing power to a circuit if only tuned
to ~8 Hz - it would probably involve whatever piezo aspect
of crystals, if they could output current as piezo sensors,
when vibrating at this frequency, thus an issue of locating
or manufacturing such crystals, tuning them as antennas.
(should Superman be mentioned here, or metaphysics of
crystals, predecessor to electronics, original components
of nature, such that this is the foundation of the study, in
this way, so too amber and lodestone, known or unknown)
the key idea then is of tuning piezos, whereby the piezo
element is itself the antenna, and this could be explored
in various ways, etched onto the surface of an existing
sensor element, such as with PVDF film tabs, or made
into a cantilever such as a tuning fork vibrating at ~8 Hz
that outputs energy into a self via its perpetual motion,
and further, crystal oscillators tuned to this frequency
of the Schumann resonance, if capable of generating or
outputting electricity via alignment with this frequency,
tuned into it in terms of energy harvesting versus timing
for circuits or for receiving or transmitting radio waves.
note: again, this is non-electromagnetic vibration that
is accessed, so oscillators and piezos are functioning
in an undescribed realm at macroscale, though within
effects _known within music (as natural philosophy),
described by composer/filmmaker Helen Hall. [8]
the mythos involved includes a realm of the forbidden
and of the fringe activity of outlawed energy research,
access to 'free energy' that is believed to have earlier
been accessed on earth by its inhabitants yet since
disappeared within civilization, vanished along with
its cosmology (of the aether), the plenum seemingly,
edited out, removed from view via Michelson-Morley.
and yet the idea of limitless energy, locating it as if an
issue of dousing within the electromagnetic framework
with various strange machines and contraptions, those
seeking to tap into it, upon relating to and realizing its
mystery that surrounds, encompasses, defines and yet
cannot be tangibly defined in these same terms it exists
because the basic model and approach are off, and just
enough to send things in another direction, still unaware
in other words, there is potential energy all around, the
issues of dead cellphones after 5 hours moot should a
small cantilever antenna find geometrical alignment that
replaces its power source with one non-electromagnetic,
non-polluting, attuned to nature and mind, in harmony
and related to the larger order, not existing to destroy it.
how to tap into it, where is it. how do you get there if
electromagnetism is off-limits to investigation beyond
an ideology of a protective technological priesthood.
and then, how to imagine beyond electromagnetism
if concepts are not understanding of this condition
firstly, to realize what the encountered issues are,
so that reasoning is possible in a shared framework
the larger question, how to tap into the infinity that is
within the electromagnetic circuit, open up that seam
between zero and infinity, and use it to turn things at
higher speeds and momentums or with greater force,
limitless power of any magnitude, seemingly. this is
essentially to break out of relativity and back into a
non-warped model of nature, so anti-gravity and other
such issues are basic and easy to advance beyond,
though if living within lies of a false perspective this is
not possible. so the worldview has to be taken down
before any landspeeders are going to arrive in town
0. The 8 Hertz approximation was used by an expert on
this issue, which is an easy round number to recall that
stands-in for whatever the exact decimal place resonance
may be for hooking up to the Schumann resonance. This

heading down the final stretch...
my fascination with sensors as an electronics concept
began with small pamphlet electronics instruction books
from Forrest Mims [0] found Shack though they
are widely available online these days. [1]  if interested
in programming microcontrollers though have not been
introduced via non-computer breadboard electronics, it
may be of interest to look at and learn from circuits in
these notebooks, which provide basic concepts for how
the circuits work and the principles they involve. for a
technical person it could be instructive, for those like
myself with a mental gap in the fundamentals there
may still be questions that need to be answered
before able to access and intuitively understand
exactly what is going on, modifying it from there
so, engineering mindset, great resource. artistic
mindset, perhaps still a significant boundary before
understanding though i have trouble with reading and
ambiguous concepts so it could be only my limitation
that kept me from learning the basics of electronics
in terms of circuitry. another is: having the parts that
are needed, versus just looking at the diagrams and
understanding what is happening, or using these for
reference, to build other circuits via same approach
or extending or borrowing certain parts of designs.
quite interesting to locate a Mims book on sensors
and piezo kit together in regard to ongoing issues
with piezo sensors and energy harvesting. [2]
what captured my imagination was the particular
notebook on sensors, their conceptual nature as
this relates to issues of feedback and intelligence
that effectively maps onto switches and gauges
as measurements of activity, indicators of events;
likewise, the reversibility of sensors, how some if
not many can be inverted in their functioning, such
that a microphone can be a speaker and vice versa
PVDF piezo film as a sensor material exemplifies
the tremendous range that a given material and its
properties can connect with, in varying dynamics
and dimensions. (if not mistaken, it can even detect
airflow while potentially creating air flow likewise)
and so one of these unique properties of piezo film
is that it can detect temperature differences. this
got me wondering (reading of its application in the
tech manual), that given its incredible sensitivity,
would it be able to detect electromagnetic fields
due to the gradiated change in radiation levels
surrounding wires, in proximity to EMF signals
this combined with the idea of the PVDF sensor
as an ANTENNA then had me wondering if this
could function in a similar realm as the standard
linear Hall effect sensor [3] that senses magnetic
fields and functions as a strain gage (analog) or
on/off switch (binary/digital) in the presence of
electromagnetic fields. and thus EMF meters,
most presumably, utilized Hall effect sensors
that have multiple axes, 1-axis to 3-axis that
relate to the geometry of the EM field in space,
and thus rotating a probe for an EMF meter in
a given context which generate varying signal,
helping define the shape and direction of the
signal, as it is positioned in space [4] [5]
so my thinking was as follows... there are these
small piezo sensor 'film tabs' that can be hooked
up to a speaker, and if they could detect signals
from home wiring in the wall, as a microphone,
then essentially it approximates an EMF meter
without the display details, though could indicate
an intensity level by how loud or soft the noise
that is picked up. perhaps this is actually not
possible though it my questioning of its use.
and this could require holding or moving the
piezo film tab, the rectangle with an audio
cable connected to it, then connected with a
small preamp/mixer, amplifier or headphones,
and perhaps moving it along the wall -- which
seems unlikely due to sensitivity -- because it
would generate massive noise seemingly, or,
to potentially move it in the air, likewise that
could seemingly make lots of noise by its
movement, masking any other signals.
it seems to go nowhere as an approach,
yet my question remains that if this PVDF
material can and does function as an antenna
and it could pick up signals via vibrations, that
perhaps if it was held or moved against a wall
with electrical wiring inside, it could access
this intense vibrational activity in some way
it is obviously unclear as an approach, as
multiple aspects coincide, both in attempting
to access a signal and how this could occur...
and thus: the issue could be having the PVDF
film tab register 'temperature variation' as a way
to monitor the difference in heat between a less
electromagnetic realm and more electromagnetic
realm as the radiation is monitored by the sensor
and is this possible or not. and further, would the
fact that the device is a capacitor then influence
its charge via induction, such that the EMFs
would charge the PVDF film, again via vibration
or heat, though which could be used as electricity
in a circuit it connects to, via energy harvesting.
the concept is that the EMF meter as device
would generate power when detecting signals.
and so the existing rectangular film tabs [6] are
potentially one way of going about this, in terms
of 'mapping temperature' as mapping of EMFs,
and seemingly related to this is the issue of the
sensor being shielded or not, as this potentially
relates to issues of tuning. what frequency or
temperature range can influence the sensor
a hypothetical application the PVDF sensor
used for mapping out EMFs, is that a cellphone
could contain such a device and be held against
the wall or on a shelf in which there is electrical
wiring, and the induction that occurs from the
wires to the capacitor via vibration of EMFs
could in effect provide charging power to the
cellphone or other once-battery-reliant device,
if energy harvesting was paired with wiring in
the home and electrical power already in place,
it would be an issue of locating it, excavating
a hidden environment, so the EMF meter as
indicator of signal strength or of radiation levels
as temperature could provide a diagnostic of a
local area via mapping it out as EM environment,
and then situate devices in this specific location,
in proximity to wires to maximize energy harvest
via vibration that perpetually charges the capacitor
(note here: if the PVDF film were etched as was
previously mentioned with further patterning, this
could massively increase voltage potentially, via
increasingly its capacitance or storage capacity
for holding energy, seemingly of higher voltage)
though what really got my mind spinning was
the idea of another format for this piezo polymer
and that is 'piezo coaxial cable'. [7] [8]
in that, this idea of PVDF as an antenna then is
tending towards a shape or form that has been
used for antennas, that is: a length of wire that
picks up signals as wavelengths geometrically
align with, map onto, influence its properties.
(that is, if not mistaken in how things work)
and so my mind starts thinking of making a
loop out of this cable, as if a transponder that
is used to track some emitting signal, or as a
certain type of TV console antenna even, if not
rabbit ears in retrospect. and what is the actual
difference in these different materials functioning,
plain metal and piezo polymer, in terms of antenna
the obvious is that the latter generates power if it
begins to vibrate. and holds onto it as a capacitor,
so it builds up and stores the external influence.
though more, consider the issue of high-voltage,
that a long length of wire could potentially hold a
lot of charge. and this in a context of sensing...
there is the classic example of 'wireless power'
in a person holding fluorescent tube lights under
the powerlines of a high-voltage pylon corridor
that in turn illuminates the lights via EMFs by
way of the surrounding intense levels of radiation
that bathe the area in proximity to such towers
so there is massive energy in the air, ionizing it,
around high voltage electric transmission towers,
enough to light a fluorescent (AC) lightbulb that
otherwise requires a ballast/transformer to do so
(again, if not mistaken), in that charge/electrons
are rapidly moving back and forth through a gas
held inside the unlit tube that then generates light
by triggering a reaction that releases or produces
photons via the current shooting through the gas
(sidenote: LEDs interesting in similar way, light
or photons produced by jumping gap in a circuit)
note: DANGER: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DO THIS
WITHOUT PROPER EXPERTISE/QUALIFICATIONS...
now imagine you have a loop of piezo coaxial cable
that can function as an antenna. potentially and-or
seemingly, it would be able to 'read' the temperature
difference via the radiation in the area underneath or
nearby similar high-voltage towers. though this may
co-exist as a variable with frequency/vibration thus
heat may just be another way of saying the same
thing, though in a more tangible or perceivable way,
in that its influence may be more apparent.
here is why it is not advisable for a do-it-yourselfer-
because any length of this piezo cable is a capacitor
that can store energy, and the larger the cable the
more voltage that could be stored, it would appear,
and thus if such an antenna were use and capable
of storing large amounts of high voltage charge, it
then could be deadly dangerous to be holding onto
this cable because it would be inducing current from
the powerlines and potentially into the body, in terms
of its grounding (say, straight through an arm to heart
then out one foot or both) potentially like getting hit
by lightning. any precautions that would be taken
by electrical workers that work on high voltage lines
would be relevant as security precautions for any
such experimentation. and yet, if a circuit were
made around such an antenna -- potentially via
paired or matching VIBRATION alone, this same
piezo cable device could potentially provide much
more power and current via its energy harvesting.
(or so it is speculated here)
in a more removed situation, or a smaller antenna,
it could potentially be used to map EMFs via piezo
wire in the way Hall effect sensors are used today,
though again with the benefit of energy harvesting
and providing power to circuitry. thus piezo cable,
as antenna, could have its own unique attributes
and properties that could better align in certain
situations or circumstances to provide power or
function as an antenna, whereby the 'microphone'
or listening is occurring in a vibrational realm that
is not connected to material vibration beyond its
own support structure, instead, as antenna it is
tuning into strong fields (as heat, here proposed)
that would potentially be capable of providing this
source of vibrational needed to power circuitry,
yet further, also a signal of meaning about the
nature of the environment in its electromagnetic
composition and ordering, mapping or direction
based on these attributes, features of landscape
that is relevant in terms of health and energy
so then i was done with thinking about it and
then encountered a photograph that inspired
another layer of thinking within this domain...
it was of a woman's hat [9] created by a fashion
designer that spoke to these issues in terms of
its language and aesthetics, providing insight into
the nature of the questions involved.
what if, for instance, the piezo film tab sensors
were able to monitor the heat or radiation as this
correlates to vibrational frequencies of cellphones
as they are held against the skull, and evaluate
the radiation involved at the blood-brain barrier as
this influences tumor development in humans via
sending this transmission of cellphone signals
from the phone to the cellular towers? in other
words, what if this little sensor could be placed
on a hat, alongside the surface of the skin, and
register and monitor the radiation levels from
omnidirectional antennas shooting EMFs and
coded patterns into the human brain, as part of
this relation between people, tools, technology
and infrastructure - "daily ~communionication"
again, the wonders of the piezo film indicate that
they do respond to monitoring of skin, and thus
likely a viable approach to modeling this relation,
and testing against "official evidence" about how
these antennas and vibrations are influencing the
human physiology. real-time cellphone monitoring
(another approach could involve a PVDF sensor at
the only opening of an otherwise EMF-opaque box
or container that has a cellphone in it, attempting to
transmit or radiate its signal, and measuring activity
via vibration or heat from this at various distances)
additional hats provided further insight into aspects
of multiple tunings [10] via adjusting cantilevers or
tuning forks, to what frequencies are related to and
through, as part of consciousness as information,
this in a non-electromagnetic framework seemingly.
and also of the nature of the mind being targeted by
hostile signaling [11] in these toxic domains of the
technical wilderness, functioning against humanity.
in that disease and illness correlate with these same
issues as they remain ignored and unaddressed, and
allowing continuing abuse of power based on hidden
leverage that results from no checks and balances
upon unrestrained technological development for
private goals and agendas, against public interest
the kicker is that such technology could already be
deployed in a hidden framework or context, just as
it is hard to imagine ubiquitous mass surveillance via
technological infrastructure without this corresponding
in some significant way to a paid informant network on
the ground, in close proximity, allowing full spectrum
monitoring that tends towards gossip as power that
is exploited in the political bias within infrastructure,
emperor no clothes policy laid bare via own tattle tales
thus, what if likewise, the potential for such sensing as
harvesting of free energy already exists yet remains in
a realm of secrecy, leveraged against populations on
the outside of this inner society. what if different truths
exist that remain unaccounted for, different economics
that then become the basis for exploitation via illusion,
via not sharing the discoveries and using this for power,
to take over domains via ruse, deception, ill-intent, etc
in other words: the conspiracy revealed, now out in the open...
take for instance the unusual aesthetics of a local substation
for electric power 'delivery', like a router, bus, or hub that then
transforms the voltage en route to its destination. under the
ordinary or standard model of power distribution, this could
be assumed to function in one way and one way only...
powerplant ==> transmission towers ==> substation ==> distribution poles
that is, the power is generated at a power station, moved
through high-voltage cables suspended from towers to a
substation, where this power is stepped down and then
further distributed via wooden poles to various dwellings
though 'the antennas' could be for lightning protection, it
seems highly unusual to have a large array of them or at
least this design approach has not yet been encountered
before this, and calls into question what is new about it.
i had previously speculated it was a free energy substation
tapping into atmospheric electricity via the antennas, though
until the PVDF sensors did not understand how this might be
possible. in fact, thinking about it right now, combining piezo
antennas with HAARP atmospheric injections of frequency is
potentially the model for remote power delivery at national or
international scale, ala Nikola Telsa's Wardenclyffe Tower [13]
in this scenario, the substation would be the 'generator' in that
it could tune into a given vibration (perhaps Schumann resonance)
and create high voltage electricity on-site, via remote transfer of
energy -as information- seemingly, outside an electromagnetic
context yet tied back into it via properties of nature, its order.
in this way, power delivery could begin at the substation locally,
then distribute back outwards to both high-voltage lines and the
reduced-voltage distribution poles, from the substation itself, a
decentralized power generation and delivery system, in effect,
locally, though harmonized at a larger scale via atmospheric
electricity as the generator or transmitter of 'motive power',
if not conceptualizing this in error. that would be the illusion,
that the powerplant is sending the power and not substation
 substation ==> transmission/distribution ==> local power
thus like a crystal oscillator functioning in reverse as piezo sensor,
if 'free energy' were being harvested at the substation-level, then a
different organization of these relations exists than what is said to
exist and used as a basis for top-down power structures in society.
a decentralized, distributed, non-toxic energy that is limitless versus
an infrastructure based on oil and gasoline and goal and nuclear energy
that is destructive, basically raping the earth and likewise its inhabitants
to fuel a given insane development strategy functioning against humanity
as this aligns with 'green politics' and 'environmentalism', its politics and
moral agenda within what is a warped accounting for various such factors.
in other words, perhaps battery power is only an issue for those on
the outside of this. if it indeed were to exist as a parallel infrastructure
in the everyday environment. and maybe that is being used as leverage,
a secret hidden development with different economics, social dynamics,
and political goals that are not 'represented' in existing language, instead
functioning outside or beyond its limiting frameworks and outdated views
and beliefs, which provide cover and camouflage for sustaining trickery,
exploiting it, and securing its place in relation to the rogue world state,
thoroughly invested in its mission to serve its hidden special interests,
having divested humanity long ago for private rewards in doing so.
wouldn't it be nice to see a circuit diagram of how those antennas
are hooked up at the substation. really interesting if it involved more
than 'ground' and instead was part of a piezo-based energy harvesting
engine capable of generating constant high-voltage power, for instance.
and who would the power to such oversight to occur within society?
seemingly nobody. that is the entirety of the situation right there-
*game over*

i did not connect the two themes together until now,
 though consider again the residential high rise building
 with an antenna array on top, previously sent to the list,
 in the context that it could be harvesting its own power
 and disconnected from the surrounding energy grid via
 the antenna array at its crown. off the books energy, at
 the same time brutal wars fought to sustain oil power...
 (how is that for ethics and morality of secret leadership,
 and issues of corruption, deception, hidden evil agenda)

i think this is actually the model for human beings as conceived
in long ago times, though may be mistaken. in the Middle Ages
or thereafter, the nervous system itself was medically illustrated
as a plant, held within the watery container of the liquid body, in
this way, in the abstract, not unlike a jellyfish with mobile ocean
again, if memory serves, perhaps it was Plato who described
also the nature of thought in terms of the brain, its enlightenment,
whereby the roots of the nervous system flower into an open mind
which receives light and nourishment from truth, tracking it this way
as flowers situate themselves according to environment, nutrients
so the idea of 'plants' and ~enlightenment, 'knowing' as this relates
to truth and essentially grounding informational and physical realms,
perhaps some kind of natural alignment taking place, harmonization
that is organic, an aspect of ecological foundation and its circuitry,
potentially then scaled to the cosmos, especially with regard to the
theories of origins via panspermia [1], ye olde mushroom astronauts,
delivering life onto earth via asteroid or comets, seeding the oceans;
in this way, sentience of octopus, dolphins, their social intelligence
and awareness, consciousness, alike with jellyfish, as if homologue
with pre-embedded state of nervous system for humans, in vitro (?)
prior to final packaging of mammalian biped and adjustable thumbs
the idea that all life moves towards higher consciousness and that
intelligence and this yearning motivation for greater truth is life, its
force, the trajectory of the grand design from nano- to macro-scale,
issues of culture, freedom, war, occurring at all scales, to survive,
conquer, for what means and ends, what principles, or darkness if
bounded by the false, those who serve it, obey it as if the master.
here cybernetic feedback likewise at all interconnected levels else
its incapacitation, making the living captive to those ceasing to live,
to grow, to evolve beyond existing constraints, limited beliefs, ideas.
the fix of ideology the danger, wrong assumptions and modeling or
subversion of view and awareness to contain, trap, mislead, control
so the idea of information related to intelligence connected with this
condition of LIFE, perhaps related also to plants and awareness, of
a natural condition of sentience even, perhaps, as biome, as with
the Gaia hypothesis of earth as supraorganism, living entity unto
itself as a larger totality or 'living ecosystem', [2] Earth as being.
i think also the book A Guide for the Perplexed delved into this
area in terms of a progression of life, from mineral to vegetable to
animal to human. [3] if not mistaken, from evaluating the wikipedia
page, the issue of nesting exists in that each higher form of life has
within it those underneath it; thus the human is inextricably related
to the mineral, vegetative, animalistic, of which they are composed,
as this also effects consciousness, awareness, and intelligence [4]
a personal experience about this issue of 'living ecosystems' that
themselves may have a larger awareness or consciousness than
just the part -- say, a forest as a supraorganism that is sentient...
(developed a close connection and friendship with a wild deer and
learned how to communicate with her. then observed behavior in
various settings, role of muteness, listening, scent, wind, shiny
objects, distance, motion, fear, nutrition, locomotion, etc. and
when relocating the deer into a more wilderness environment,
it became apparent how she was one-with-the-environment in
a way that an urban park did not allow, as if in wrong circuitry;
deer can basically disappear within a few feet in a forest, and
be totally silent at the same time as observing you searching
for them or just moving past, through their domain. then in the
effort to communicate, connection with camouflage and trees
and leaves helped realize how antlers are very much like sticks,
and how 'eyes' on trees, openings in the bark, are like those of
deer and other animals watching or monitoring the area, each
connected to the others, as part of a larger connected system.
as if all eyes of the forest even. part of a larger awareness and
knowing this, having this as consciousness, shared circuitry.
in other words the deer is the forest, the forest is the deer,
the tree is the deer, the deer is the tree, a hidden symbiotic
relation or structural connectivity that goes beyond one entity
or one life, and spans across them as a larger, longer relation
as if functioning together, moving in a shared direction, thus
life dependent on other life, in terms of its dynamic circuitry,
then stresses, pressures, motivations occurring against this)
should have also mentioned issues of governance related to
consciousness and intelligence, knowledge and awareness
as they rely on shared structures and foundations (circuitry)
that allow self-sustaining or connected systems to develop
within certain parameters, and thus origin stories of rocks
and minerals connected with cosmological big bang and
development of universe, galaxies, solar system, planets;
this then physics and chemistry, molecules moving into a
realm of organisms, life, and of vegetation and plants, thus
biology, botany, chemistry, horticulture, (if not aspects of
archaeology, paleontology in terms of research & studies),
then into fauna, animals, realm of biology and zoology if
not anthropology, to move into sociology, anthropology,
economics, politics, culture, 'arts', architecture, crypto.
(note here- question of crypto at mineral and vegetable,
not just present-day context of p2p computer exchange)
also note the role of behaviorist science to treat humans
only as animals, lowering their intellectual status via a
limited model of existence to Darwinian framework that
squares humans with apes, not divine entities or origin,
as this relates to loss of empirical truth, logic, reasoning
within society then enforced by universities, psychiatry
in particular, where 'medicine' helps this devolutionary
process occur, in the black arts of political diagnoses
that reverse the alchemical process: lead to gold via
toxic pills that destroy circuitry and the ability to think,
all to uphold a worldview of humans as merely animals,
managed as livestock, routed to holocaust cattle chutes
here, the ideology buttressed by anthropological skulldiggery
and archaeological equivalence, the sociological likewise as
if all are the same, no matter if ascending or descending in
relation to having once previously ascended or descended,
such that apes becoming more human-like, humans more
apelike, humans more humans, apes more and more ape;
and hell, why not reference Planet of the Apes once again
as a context for Lincoln related civil war of said ideology
so behaviorism backed up by 'political sciences' as cult,
as this translates into a dumbing-down and enforcement
of status quo dynamics, moving from human to the animal,
vegetable, & mineral, the more robotic, base the interactions
and so consciousness, awareness, intelligence, communication
becoming less and less overt time, bounded by psychiatric limits
of what that is perceptible is acceptable in given frameworks, the
'brain police' monitoring everyone as potentially out of control apes,
this slavery, contained within a ideology that has become the state,
requires certain beliefs and conformance to illusory representations
and obey is the only option- or else, there goes your mind & body
biome again, people living in toxic realm, despoiled environment
then forcibly adapted to it if not by peer pressure as selection,
the most unfit and mediocre the champions and successors in
wasteland, just follow brain-dead rules of the machine to survive;
(if that does not work, take these pills and start behaving or else;
children as young as 2 y.o. being dosed by psychiatrists to rewire
troubled beings in such a hellhole, killing off any chance of survival
before turning completely bonkers when cerebrum lights all at once,
essentially programming population of mind-controlled psychopaths;
forgot implant antenna, deranged psych pills enough to circuit design)
so peoples in mental institutions often referred to as vegetables,
as with those brain dead in hospitals, else comatose, operating or
existing in a realm beyond. catatonia, etc. as this tends also to a
realm of mootness, or otherness, perhaps related to the autistic,
of a bounded or limited realm where communication is not occurring
yet should be or once did, those somehow is miswired or rewired
and thus the circuits are not connected or integrated to enable
the internal/external relation, as if person trapped inside the self
and how this relates to communication and balancing, processing
of stimuli, how to make sense of what is going on, especially if
living in a frenetic world that does not make sense to begin with
the correlation to this general condition (it as nausea, malaise)
is a Spore-like entity that can function as essentially brainless,
mindless, and make-do and make-their-way in the labyrinth as
if dungeon master granted special powers and abilities. this is
The Beast known as feelings-only, who matches phase change
and state to what is liked and not liked, what makes happy or
sad or mad, mediating existence on these immediate terms
without capacity, depth, or willingness to consider beyond this
quasi-emotional framework, detached from larger grounding in
surrounding truth, such that judgement can be immediate as
to sensory perception, yet also disconnected from the larger
reality, and instead function as delusion state of being and
mistaken awareness. these people become MANAGERS
(a joke here), many times. and compliance to rules, other
beliefs in a too-simple and stupidistic mindset/framework
then orchestrates and elevates the dumb to supremacy as
'true believers' in the warped model, because of its benefits
to them and their kind, without further question or insight;
just following, enforcing, repeating, extending mediocrity
when these types become teachers, in autocratic status-
based hierarchy, 'truth' is legislated by likable beliefs and
those unliked, disfavored, easily censored based on moral
belief in superiority of this lesser and base existence and
way of being and 'thinking' as if a more limited animal, in
that the human becomes a trained ape by such relation,
as it becomes education, career, 'voting', and otherwise
so, choosing to be vegetable, choosing that path, and
communicating or scenting and signaling in that realm,
procreation, spawning more of such kind automatically,
housing, feeding, schooling, refining a given production
to enable such a mindless population to manage us,
the lower then determining actions of those higher in
a realm of functioning, awareness, ideas, capacities;
and because politically correct, illegal to say anything
against this for fear of upsetting those benefiting from it
another aspect is drug culture in the supposedly non-legal
domain though also hypocritically mainstream, thus law
does not apply if favored, yet is used to imprison others
unprotected. professional drug users staying out of prison,
others with any infraction that threaten the state: goodbye
then moralizing about anything from this perspective as if
universal quite problematic, if only for the massive bullshit
factor it involves on a corrupt societal scale, prophets of
counterculture too many to list, though enough shithead
musicians represent into the present day, so it becomes
unnecessary- just turn on media and see the idiots posing
as if enlightened, encultured to wasteland as peak, ideal
instead of base, bottom-feeding, making profit from shit
within this context of counterculture, drug zeitgeist the
counter pendulum to rise of psychiatric and its duplicity,
the structural connection and association with 'new age'
of consciousness, awareness, philosophical beliefs and
questioning of principles, religious, spiritual, every other
so quaaludes and acid trippers reach top of mountain as
Moses' and then fall all the way back down again, repeat
this thousands and millions of times, the more piling on,
and this too a search for enlightenment for many, if not
of destroying the self in order to find the self once again,
the displacement then involving recentering, and a way
into questioning and other way and types of knowing
the problem is that it is removed of its depth, grounding
as ritual and of potential spiritual practice and instead
can function in a realm of the base and profane, and
thus tends towards devolutionary processes rather
than the opposite, indicating growth beyond existing
boundaries, not just in a single realm, though overall,
in the total circuit. for example, you could be in bliss
temporarily yet residing in a shithole for the rest of life
and it may not balance out or move beyond this or
even be able to be sustained, the destructive cycle
where drugs can short-circuit via near-term fixes
for longer-term problems, larger situations beyond
the self, yet drugs can entrap people in their own
smaller worldviews, create boundaries not open up
connections, and rely on synchronizing with sickness
and toxic conditions and become further a part of
its structure, the downward force and momentum,
yet not accounted for this way, taken out of context
that is the bullshit about too-easy enlightenment,
that it is in the pill and not in the self to begin with,
and about access and unlocking and not substituting
a life for a parallel condition existing outside or beyond
it, no longer responsible or responsive to surroundings,
then becoming this ecosystem, eyes and ears of the
drug even, which is the larger point of the vegetative
people becoming cocaine, becoming heroine, they
as if plants, the awareness of 'like=like' then mapping
into consciousness with others and hidden subculture,
knowing who is within a similar domain or functioning
based on subtle clues and intelligence and signaling
who has gone far into the void, who knows what you
know or has seen what you have seen. what kinds of
knowledge, misery, motivations, betrayals, violence,
deceptions. what kind of treachery hangs in the air
as a potential, what parameters or dimensions exist
in superposition that given nearby circuitry could alight
this can be a realm of seers and sages and prophecy,
of intelligence if grounded, connected to ideas, yet it
can as easily lead into babble and vacancy of truth
beyond the illusion, lead astray into further falsity,
and thus how a person is grounded then influences
how drugs effect and their mediation, what results
this could be a healthy controlled practice that is
medicinal and rite-of-passage, or it could lead towards
loss of greater truth or purposes, and people instead
devolving to the drug, becoming trapped, encrypted
in its domain, surrogate yet also societal parasite
doing bidding of forces subhuman, antihuman even
as organisms seek to control and define territory as
ecosystem, the orchid keeping insects alive for its
own good, drugs governing others nervous systems
the plague of their effectiveness is not only in body,
it is also in the brain and mind, where drugs can limit
sensory considerations into a narrow range and thus
'intelligence' can become confined to a smaller world
and view as ecosystem that relies on false constraints
required for the ecosystem to function as it already does
thus institutionalizing what can be inequalities or biases
or injustices to sustain what is a false-consciousness
at the universal level it may be perceived or believed,
in some sense artificial or unnatural, unreal, a fiction
yet inside this circuitry, it may be 'the most real reality'
consider the human entity as circuit, the nervous system
having a spinal column mapping nerves, sensory feedback
of body into brainstem and 'mind', the capital of the column
consider this is a platform for development, and how any
nutrients or vegetation or carnivore activity then influences
this system in its functioning, the parameters it exists and
sustains itself within, in terms of its governance as scaled
to a larger shared relation with others, in structural terms
(ie the state). thus, any atoms and molecules that go into
this feedback-based system have certain functioning that
result in how it all relates, the dynamics of interaction and
exchange, where truth resides and how it is processed,
not totally unlike a pinball game in its tallying of points
so, if eating some minerals, say having water from a
spring, there could be iron in the water that effects how
a person functions, like vitamins, which then programs
certain cells or influences function, say in regard to blood
somehow or various organs that process these nutrients
or manage those parameters as part of total metabolism
water and humans create a circuit. water is a circuit and
humans are a circuit and together they combine. and it
goes into ecosystems, clouds, environment, ground,
such that if the land is toxic the water is likely effected
and thereby the person, even if in trace amounts, as part
of how the larger ecosystem is balanced, finds alignment
and adjusts or adapts or deteriorates in given dynamics,
perhaps a person becomes ill from lead in the water, etc
likewise, leafy greens in a salad as circuitry, food, and
meat, say from a cow, as this relates to how ingredients
used for daily diets effect and are effected by a larger
circuit, of self though also of groups of people, the state
they together compose, and the environment itself as a
part of this relationship, dynamic, in existing dimensions;
how these are or are not accounted for, then, precluding
what is tallied or 'acknowledged' and in what ways, else
denied, say chemicals on plants that promote cancer
via homeopathic approach, poisoning via 1,000 disease
vectors to eventually hit the genocide jackpot over time;
so too, raising cattle in debilitating conditions, injecting
with hormones to negatively effect humans down range,
eating spiked levels of animal stress and pain as circuit,
perhaps losing nutrition though gaining the amplification
of similar disease promotion via chemical absorption
into cells, their malfunctioning, all part of the plan
this as circuitry, toxic ecosystem functioning against
LIFE, devolving humans to livestock yet vegetable and
eventually robots via very same ideology of technique
removed of higher truth than what is politically allowed,
thus allowing social, behavorial, mental-engineering to
head towards this as if nirvana, 'enlightened following'
where greatest capacity is equated with end of cycle
of existence, by way of extinction of human 'species';
and it is legislated no less. how stupid do people have
to be to go along with it, especially unthinkingly, without
resistance or taking it on as a situation... why is there
an absence of intelligence in dealing with the basics
here, why the gap? perhaps everyone is stoned and
playing games on their fucking iphones, using PGP
to complain about how crooked things are, IDFK
and yet enlightened, opinionated, at same time helpless,
pathetic, yet self-righteous as if superior awareness or
knowing while incapacitated and unwilling to take the
leap into the maw of death enough to trust greater truth,
that the purpose is much larger than any person and that
an infrastructure exist, nature itself, to remedy this situation
beyond all the lies, and yet there is lack of faith or belief--
in truth. in logic. in reality beyond a limited warped view
reliant on relativism, the lies and betrayals of education
becoming commonplace as viewpoint, turned against self,
people cannot even trust their own minds, so thoroughly
mistaken and beholden to external validation of what is
so basically, the individual is fucked. the shared set of
people absolutely absent from engaging the situation in
the terms it exists, beyond the self and small groups
that still can rely upon and benefit from the bullshit factor
and various other limits, impeding larger ecosystem truth,
being that is beyond existing boundaries or misconceptions
then it is a time of count of be counted, who is awake
and who is aware and who serves truth and is willing to
make sacrifices and who are those doing it already and
how is this all connected in a larger structural framework,
as it relates individual awareness in varying dimensions with
others, molecular processing of interconnected consciousness
and where does mind meet its embodiment, deeds, not only
words, and at what scale or what limitation, what amount of
self-serving bullshit and privilege versus sacrifice, losing the
egostic framework that requires its own safety to persist,
disconnection from suffering as if above, instead corrupted
and serving self firstly and projecting this outward to others;
unaccounted for, how much betrayed by the psycho-logical,
a great many tells exist for parameters that remain para-
and thus insight can tend towards involution, yet warped
and ungrounded, as if superior knowing when actually less
thus is the nature of the egotist who believes because of
station to know everything, even though wrongly, while
mocking another who thinks they know something, as if
that is the arrogance and an impossible, due to superiority
on these themes then, there are people who journey into
a realm of drugs and document their research, such as
ethnobotanist Terrance McKenna, [5] and this tends also
towards Thompson-Leary cryptography, [6] in that it is not
only the signaling of plants themselves though their effects
within people and culture, which extends this signaling at
human scale and in human dynamics and ecosystems,
that could be sacred or profane, given implementation
though perhaps also more than this: toxic and poison
exists and being able to absorb it can deteriorate not
enhance in the ways believed as if all is transcendent,
or like climbing mountains, leads to heights not depths;
(if living in an inverted world, things may be backwards)
(note here: as with crystals and piezo-sensors as organic
or natural circuitry, the chemical compounds and circuitry
of drugs, both those defined legal and illegal [7][8], as it
relates to how that circuitry, visualized, may correlate with
certain dimensions and parameters of its effects, in that
the different visual structure maps to different systems in
the body and mind, different ecosystems or dynamics.
thus, like a custom programmed IC or microcontroller,
so too Aspirin or Ambien or Acid or patterns delivered.
in other words: where's the message, what is the key,
where is the information, what is encrypted, how is this
circuitry, how does it map, metabolize, transform and
change, positive and negative dynamics, feedback...
and not to forget, all of this as language, its calculus)
principles and intelligence related to horticulture, then,
Luther Burbank's work The Training of the Human Plant
[9] as this could relate to culture, cultivation, the cultic
imagination and manifestation, of ideas and of ideology
if raising the vegetable as higher consciousness and
becoming one with nature, it could also involve loss of
certain critical facilities or awareness in turn, and this
could be a danger for a way of being that no longer is
human, or no longer serves a higher truth than what is
accessed immediately and in proximity to the body
in terms of its likes and agreements and hospitalities,
and a movement away from truth or regression could
occur, and thinking could be turned against itself so
that the lower is again the higher, people in service
to something that is less intelligent, though in this
way, combining with the circuit, ecosystem, fusing
and then becoming vegetable, animal. in terms of
rites-of-passage, this may be inherent, as with an
embryological view of reptile, mammalian sections
of brain as it develops, old brain and new, and yet,
to then situate a self in a limiting framework and
obey its constraints could also be to decouple
from the natural world for an illusion replacing it,
a false consciousness believed as if higher truth
here be witchcraft and paganism and other forms,
cannibalism and other practices likewise that can
operate in such physics though also in exploitation
not recognize or serve other truths, this danger of
losing the human, turning to falsity as power. and
thus 'humans as plants' turns to 'plants as human'
and another framework of ethics, morality, judgement
and ways of being potentially aligned in other terms
thus people occupy these realms, some witchcraft
dark and serving against truth, while others good
and using knowledge of nature and its metaphysics
for life, healing, medicine, the paradoxical condition,
the Caduceus [10] and Rod of Asclepius [11], their
dual-role of sickness and health, the importance of
being able to recognize its value and not outlaw it,
the truth involved, yet to do so accurately, clearly,
accounting for actual conditions and not ideological,
which then infects minds, corrupts intelligence, etc
(a double-dealing War of Drugs that is a hypocritical
onesided takedown of political enemies forbids this
yet exploits the condition to retain silence, or else
the NSA will ruin your life and quicken extinction.
this is how evil gets a foothold in society, becoming
governance, people obeying and serving this falsity)
so, what say you to worshiping mandrake root? [12]
"i'm up for it, do you have coke to go along with it?"
perhaps tending to profane here... people becoming this
drug, its deliverance as plague even, as consciousness
that is skewed and distorted and worms its way further
into culture via principles aligned with toxic dynamics,
becoming ecosystem, way of being turns to nothingness.
the void, a mirror-image of knowing that is actually false,
ungrounded in its symmetrical belief, incorrectly aligned
with events yet not accounting for structural aberrations
and therefore ignorance a basis of such supreme belief,
as if above it all, operating in a realm of higher awareness
when instead a conceit that does not correlate with reality
and eventually, to be accounted for in cosmic ecosystem
what this is to suggest is that, people becoming plants
is a devolutionary process, a regression of intellectual
capacity that returns to feeling-based diagnostics that
can be localized out of other dimensional frameworks
that were once connected, coherent, and correlated
as lies and falsity are normalized, toxic poison of mind
that is shared amongst many can, like invasive species
overtake localities, growing and thriving in place of the
natural habitat, with devastating consequence for the
prospects of life on terms against the ecosystem, or
ecosystem engineered to be against sustaining of life,
these destructive principles of death and hate, turning
people into lower lifeforms, humans as subhumans, as
if only apes or less than this even, judged, sentenced
to death via this insane and evil ideology, this artifice,
unaligned, disconnected, hostile to nature, life, love
then it should be mentioned- turning this into religion...
use of what seems to be a multimeter to diagnose the
human in its electromagnetic circuitry, as lying plant,
though to question Scientology methodology, if this
fever graph is mapping of galvonic skin response or
perhaps 'information' in its vibrational context, as the
circuits would be different, and perhaps another layer
or boundary of interpretation exists between these, in
that non-acoustic acoustic phenomena could be judged
as acoustic, or non-acoustic as electromagnetic yet the
circuits evaluated could be too simple for what is involved
and thus the problem of thinking, of logic and reasoning
in relativistic frameworks that could tend towards rule
of behaviorism _over mind, over higher awareness and
in this way- the rule of language over people, so that
ideas must conform to a given rationalization, ideology
that can be wrong-headed or wrong-minded or of wrong
or inaccurate beliefs yet unchecked as ecosystem and
in this way, mislead or rely on certain 'limited knowing'
versus actual understanding or comprehension beyond
a given faulty framework, where short-circuiting could
be the key to health and not just sickness, correcting
every anomaly leading to forced silencing, versus the
role of sensors, the diagnostic evaluation, clues that
map out circuitry yet not necessarily in their entirety,
the mystery much larger than any parts combined,
when disconnected from ecosystem as if controlled;
the false consciousness default if methodologically
forcing such truth, grounding to the false all too easy,
perhaps the main sickness of institutions over time,
corruption from reliance on ideas divorced from truth
beyond narrowed limits, losing self-awareness while
representing it as if pillar or structure, foundation for
others, symbolic, yet still potentially ungrounded,
the problem of being blinded from believing to know
and yet in this belief, forbidding such awareness
in other words, once again, attaining grounding in
an unnatural or toxic habitat, as this potentially can
relate to lies or falsity, and then 'enlightenment' by
the normalization of this ecosystem relation that
can function in negative, hostile, immoral relations
and dynamics for food, survival, shelter, knowledge,
then going on to represent and replace culture that
was to serve life and now is about serving death and
a certain range of parameters, dimensions, dynamics
that are 'healthy' and 'good' for this diseased condition
and its state of being that is centered on nothingness,
no higher goals than the base and material exploitation
crypto in this context, signaling, as patterns and signs,
symbols and their processing, relations based on these,
correlation between circuitries, issues of competing biomes
and ecosystems, different if hidden ecosystems, ecologies,
different mechanisms and dynamics, as this maps onto
forms, artifacts, events, to be read/written as language,
the correlation of dimensions, shared or unshared, like
or unlike, those who are vegetable-like feeling-based if
not connected with the false world and the oppression,
versus those thinking beyond, into/from other principles-
all of it as circuitry, consciousness, signaling, codes,
crypto, messaging and communications, protocols,
layers, habitat, food, poison/medicine, culture, flow
what is the greater consciousness of the false order?
perhaps the shared lie as it maps to realms of artifice
what is the greater consciousness of truth?
perhaps shared being in the world, truth, live, love
in this way, two entities and existences, information
and its circuits grounding either to truth or to falsity
(the paradox: never beyond a realm of good and evil)

@_author: brian carroll 
@_subject: blackflag operations 
at a certain point in my independent research it was
realized that the US flag itself represented the existing
problem encountered with ideology and rule-following
that automatically functions against core principles,
such that 'the stars' were of false constellations and
'the stripes' were more those of prison bars, to hold
the population captive inside a hierarchical top-down
structure, which i equate with a conceptualization in
Networks of Power, of system, order, and control [1]
as it determines economic, social, political dynamics.
thus the US flag, its symbolism, is part of the problem
in terms of its rigid adherence, especially in a realm of
patriotism and xenophobia, such that it appears to deign
reasonable the US as world empire without questioning
its own failures or correcting for them, only extending it
further outward, which then serves policies the hidden
US dictatorship perfectly, as long as silence is upheld
and no communication is possible about these issues.
(that is, in terms of reasoning of empirical truth as this
would be observed by the law as the basis for power,
versus making the constitution a relativistic document
interpreted via power determining what the signs mean)
in this way, so too the powerplant and grid of development
that underlines present-day civilization, a centralized and
hidden realm of top-down power and control governed by
private interests said to function on behalf of the public,
yet with little evidence of this within ruins of the planet.
in other words: power delivery is related to governance.
and how power flows in one-direction and 'represents'
certain goals and ideals that do not map into the local
issues or shared values beyond a certain framework or
mindset that makes monetary profit is greatest truth.
and yet truth does not work this way. which is to say,
it is not invalidated by ignoring or censoring it out of
existence within these domains, it still exists though
is isolated, disconnected, and thus loses its power
via a false-worldview that takes its place via lies and
deception, a shared illusion that is ungrounded yet
sustained in a bubble, antihuman in word and deed.
in terms of consciousness, much of this is known
and experienced day to day, life to life, yet remains
uncommunicable due to the loss of language, the
absence of connection in realistic terms, about this
inhuman condition, the center of civilization becoming
that of nothingness, of lost souls at the core of it, this
essential vacancy of meaning, devaluing of knowledge
beyond what interests and benefits those in authority,
and thus a seemingly irrational situation exists and is
mediated, one by one, that does not add up nor does
it make any sense, part to whole, because all is left
is fragmented and misaligned, dumbed down, warped
and skewed such that a hall of fun-house mirrors is
the limit to daily reflection in status quo relations, as
nothing more can be said than some finite limit where
the basic situation cannot even be acknowledged, so
hostile is the background and near-field effects, that
any error or wrong thought could jeopardize survival
and force a person into exile or worse, via all-seeing
accountants for conformity, verifying and making sure
the brain washing is effective, all remain followers of
the ideological framework, staying within its confines
and so knowing is disconnected for saying or even
thinking, people detached from themselves and others
and then to awake and find oneself situated in this way;
essentially without being, without access to their own
true nature or capacity or abilities, instead neutered
by what is now convention, via subversion, deception
electromagnetism as the context for the US flag then
recontextualizes some questions of vexillology [2], in
that evaluating the symbolic structure of the flag in its
relation to electrical infrastructure as a system of power
that extends beyond electricity into issues of politics of
the state, including waging of war for natural resources,
and likewise systems based on this ordering, visualized
in urban and rural artifacts of transmission pylons and
distribution poles, then provides further context for the
issues of control - including 'surveillance' in this same
top-down structure, which serves the hierarchy firstly,
to retain its existing historical organization, however
hollowed out and corrupted, used as a false-flag op
in thinking through issues of endless war in the
Middle East and the nonsensical War of Error as it
relates to failure of ideas to govern state actions and
instead submission to faith in leadership and hidden
policies and political agendas, antihuman in ideology
and nature, due to their inaccuracy, loss of capacity
in thinking and language that then functions against
citizens and life, instead of on behalf of these -- this
situation then becoming 'source code' and program
based on flawed and wrong-minded processing of
actions, using, relying upon, exploiting loopholes
in the US constitution as basis for what is possible,
this becoming morality and ethics and its own truth,
the danger of action being untethered from grounded
reasoning and instead FAITH-BASED in ideology of
rightness, with no remaining checks and balances
after the orchestrated power grab, post-coup (41)
in which the state is opposed to truth that does not
serve and submit to this hidden agenda as highest
what have you then, as a citizen in this situation,
do you benefit or are your days numbered as you
wait, channeled into the correct chutes for awaiting
cattle cars, death panels and Obamacare first steps
enough is enough, sanity must regain its place, and
reason based in grounded truth must be secured for
anything other than this automatic decline to continue
into a realm of pure hate and unrestrained evil, driven
by the state in its godless construction and operation
in this way, US Blackflag operations were called for
to regain control over the state and its actions via
an emergency measure built into the constitution that
allows a constitutional convention to be called if or when
the state goes off course due to legal guidelines once written
yet which function against the very principles they stand for
and thus, to raise the Blackflag as the symbol and sign of
this human citizen, to reclaim control over the shared state
and its governance, and remove the existing US flag from its
role as oppressor of its own and other populations, in that
the truth of the US Constitution has become decoupled from
its accounting in logic, beyond that of shared opinion within
language (sign=sign based pattern matching), such that the
views 'believed' are ideological, based and reliant upon ever
shifting relativism that maps to motives of power & authority
over this process of interpretation, as institutionalized, this
the very structure of society, politics, economics, yet within
a bubble view that cannot be falsified, contested, debated
even (see: closed, onesided mass media), and this as the
authority, the 'mind' at the top of the machinery, that sees
and observes everything in this warped, unreal self-serving
viewpoint, that what is good for it is the best for everybody,
any number of rationalizations reinforcing this viewpoint,
and yet no error correction anywhere allowed, especially
in a legal context, because truth itself has been outlawed
thus the ability to critique or correct the malfunctioning of
the state is an impossibility, given the loss of reasoning
that no longer relies upon empirical truth for verification
and validation of processes, and instead 'shared belief'
and a 'superior knowing' takes this place, without anchor
to truth outside a binary simplism, yet beyond correction
for its errors, because they can be ignored, denied, and
the other side destroyed, as is necessitated ideologically;
one side must lose for the other side to win, these "rules"
blackflag would counter this coup and takeover of the state
by a hostile invading population by regaining legal control
over its decision-making and accounting for events in terms
of accountable truth, not allowing secrecy and privilege to
stand-in for assurances of 'good intentions' underneath it all,
at the same time those opposed to institutionalized criminality
are being weeded out of civilization one by one, via surveillance
and attacks against basic existence and subsistence, those
of the traitorous state having been empowered by the takeover
to go the next step, the purging of dissenters and dissidents,
of any who threaten their agenda, privatizing the public realm
and denying services to those not of their shared demographic
in this way, so too, US taxes serving this group primarily as
others go without or are attacked by these same services,
health care becoming administering of disease and death,
social services to increase helplessness and incapacitation,
maximizing profits while engineering conditions impossible
to survive, thus crushing the life out of those at the bottom
and making each year more difficult than the last, death as
if a gift, it cannot arrive early enough, genocide as if mercy
my first attempt at conveying these ideas was to recolor the
US flag as all black while retaining its stars and stripes as
the structure[3]. the problem with this was that it revealed
the ideological formatting of the state, in its rigid lines and
ordering that are the manifestation of this corruption of the
historic compact between individuals & larger organization,
and how governance at the top requires imprisoning those
below, as part of the warped structural dynamics relied upon
and thus injustice built-into the system, its foundation, this
notably in 'mankind' as the shared identity, this privatized
viewpoint scaled to the public allowing any individual to act
in pure selfishness without regard or responsibility to others-
this enshrined in law, outdated as viewpoint, 'the public' does
not exist in this state beyond an 18 century notion, and this
is exactly how this corruption is allowed operate today, by
not acknowledging this condition and correcting it in law-
which requires logic, 3-value and N-value logic, to prove
the binarist viewpoint wrong though also immoral, illegal,
unethical, and yet this very 'reasoning' is forbidden today.
i began to sew, having a black nylon technical fabric,
the goal being to generate a more accurate structure for
the flag that would reflect or in some way represent the
actual dynamics of truth within society, these ideals and
principles of the US constitution in a shared human context,
where both men and women are equal as citizens, and that
people operate in different conditions yet function together
as part of a larger dynamic, an ecosystem that becomes
the state via a decentralized and distributed organization,
scaling from local to national if global contexts, conditions,
situations, aligned via shared dimensions, truth as value
the flag that resulted [4] has a slightly different symbology.
there are many stars, points of light, though some of these
become larger stars via their connected patterning (that is,
points connect or scale up into larger star structures, and
some may be separated at any moment & other combined)
the goal was to demonstrate that constellations of people
or ideas can form, amongst points of individuals, organize
into patterned structures that form a basis for shared order,
and while in the photograph of the flag it is not visible, there
are various regions or boundaries for these relations/events,
where some of these points and stars exist within the same
limits and others exist beyond or outside a given threshold.
(there were additional close-up photos though i do not have
most any of my work archived, though the language of the
zigzag stitching defined these various regional boundaries,
that then translates into near or far within larger ecosystem)
add to this then the linking or networking of these 'stars',
that for me are based on the butterfly paper clamp and also
on the star as a high-voltage transmission pylon or tower, in
this way, structural interconnections can be conceptualized
as -p-o-w-e-r-l-i-n-e-s- and also as the invisible lines that link
together constellations invisibility mapping out the night sky
as stars and structures relate, and capture or model meaning,
to include helping with navigation, awareness, and worldview
in this sense pattern recognition is structural, foundational,
and connections and relations between people in shared truth
is this larger empirical awareness, emerging from relativistic
scenarios, as truth is aligned amongst people and related to
and through, in changing dynamics, shared state as circuitry
and information processor, logical reasoning and organization,
this _ground-up leveling of awareness, ideas, intent, action,
virtue, truth, justice, development, higher purpose, ideals
in this way, so too, power delivery, locally to regionally and
how it scales based upon its shared relation with truth and
those who serve it, as this contrasts with the US flag and
its institutionalization where such dynamics are disallowed,
and people are silenced in these relations, truth vanquished,
something else taking hold, terrorizing citizens in its place
this call for the blackflag to rise and replace the corrupt
US government by legal means, regaining control of the
failed state via constitutional right, then is a challenge to
the reigning falsity that rules and politically 'governs', using
its power against citizens to secure its power indefinitely,
relying on illegal means and methods beyond accountability
due to secrecy and privacy that only applies to oppressors,
while such protections are removed for enemies and used
to exploit and force the downfall of those who live here
the language then may become shared, that yes, such
high insanity must be acknowledged and thus the charade
can be further extended to allow continuing control as these
subversive others continue to attempt to control the reins of
state action, at any cost. and thus mimicry could exist that
seeks to 'represent' this cause via a traditional mindset that
is corrupted by ideology and "believes" something other than
what is said, serves some unacknowledged agenda or view,
that is only camouflaged by the flag, and thus is assumed
to retain control, whatever the shifting dynamics by relying
on the same structures to persist, whatever the new color
in this way, the blackflag yet another false flag for these
traitors who would exist alongside those involved, grounded
within this structural awareness of truth, its transparent and
logical accounting beyond skewed binary onesidedness. a
realm of imposters, mimics, cheats and frauds thus would
continue and yet to juxtapose, compare and contrast these
dynamics, it should be clear that 'the rationale' is entirely
different for these two flags [5], they are not the same idea,
and do not sustain the same beliefs, principles, or ordering
they are actually set against one another in this very moment,
as changes begin to be wrought and pressures exist that still
constrain such actions, based upon resistance, power and
authority based on forbidding what is best for human citizenry
the ideological grid of the present is a cage, a prison camp
purpose-built for human holocaust whereby truth is denied
and eventually outlawed, nonexistence as the present day,
people trapped and existing inside an illusion, not living, only
trying to sustain themselves, keep breathing in the cemetery
in this condition, this separation into many, the individual parts
begin communicating, realize connections in grounded truth
that establish this empirical framework needed, and it involves
taking down the walls built by the state, its prison bar stripes
and false-stars and false-constellations based on emulation,
the state as hollywood movie production, leaders as actors
playing a role on the world stage, versus addressing issues
that exist and being held accountable for such 'representation'
driven by taxation that grows this machinery while seeking to
extinguish citizens inside who do not obey or are the enemy
of those with power. that is what can be seen within various
signs and symbols, language, calculus, patterns & geometry
the difference between these flags is the difference between
ideas and ideology, shared truth versus shared falsity and lies,
freedom versus imprisonment, responsibility versus greed and
unfettered selfishness, duty in opposition to vanity and frivolity,
the network versus the grid, being vs. nothingness, humanity
versus antihumans, individuals vs. institutions, democracy of
human citizens versus corporate democracy, empirical reality
versus relativistic madness, and philosophy versus psychiatry
the existing US flag is the embodiment of politics that replace
the truth with its antithesis which becomes a basis for power,
the blackflag is all about governance, between people who
create and compose the larger state via empirical reasoning
that is based in truth, accounted for and error corrected by
logic, and held accountable and required to change, improve
its functioning, not given the right to ignore its obligations to
people, life, nature, and the larger order it is situated within
the delivery of power will one day arrive, deliverance from this
corrupted condition, within a organized coherent agenda that
regains control over this automated machinery serving wrong
principles and wrong ideas and wrong thinking and beliefs.
there are two orders, represented by these flags. one of
them is aligned with falsity and serves it for its own benefit.
the other serves truth, firstly and wholeheartedly. it is about
how the constitution of a person aligns with those around them
and how this scales and relates and is represented by the state.
the false have their flag. recoloring it is not going to change
anything structural, which is required for the oppression and
exploitation to continue. it can only and must be destroyed as
an institutionalized structure to regain control over the failed state,
as the US constitution outlines and allows. the nature of truth is
conceptualized in the other flag, its blackness has depth and
grounding in principles that reflect those of its people and those
who sacrifice and serve, for greater truth and higher principles
than the base and monetary as if the meaning of life eternal
in other words, no longer will the body govern over the mind,
no longer will the grid determine the network, nor ideology
the truth of ideas. and indeed there is a binary condition
that exists in this situation- between truth and pseudo-truth,
where actual truth grounds to 1 and pseudo-truth to falsity (0).
in this way there is only one value, it is truth. all or nothing.
the US state needs to be brought under constitutional control,
destroy the existing dictatorship, and draft a new constitution
i for one stand against the ongoing criminality of the state
and vote the military take control of its functioning to secure
its actions from those hostile to human citizens and our future

@_subject: conceptual theatre 
in times like these you might expect there would be
music about what is going on, films investigating the
concepts (many quite good actually), other activities,
painters painting (a few) and so on, to establish depth
to conversation and communication instead of enforcing
ideological limits and functioning in limited parameters,
reinforcing traditional feedback loops corruption relies upon
especially plays, literature. perhaps some of the latter in
its detachment or documentary aspects or parallels yet
where is the cultural insight of those most free on earth-
why the silence when searching for 'play on surveillance'
that would have theater delving into realm of importance
and providing critique, frameworks to evaluate ongoing
situations within, instead of- well, seemingly nothing.
- of - the - most - free - people - in - the - entire - world -
with nothing to say or views to share about this situation,
not using their rights or freedoms -- adding up to nothing
fucking disgraceful. shameful, self-indulgent, self serving
hypocrisy. as if bureaucracy must sign off on everything.
no allowable risk. disneyification of the entirety of culture,
endless reruns of previous ideas and interpretations yet
no one with enough insight to frame this given picture?
or is it fear that holds people back, silence is safety
no one willing to take a stab at it, and then another
to regain a space and place lost to complacency and
lack of will, responsibility, greater purpose than money
certainly playwrights of the past would have engaged,
though what about direct engagement, for understanding
to model the situation and evaluate it as only theater
can do, to create other atmospheres that capture these
situations and make what is ineffable due to abstractness
tangible, realized, understood, and relatable through use
of actors and storytelling and stage and props, scenery
my contribution to this, as a structural idea for plays
about surveillance society, free for use as a concept:
that a stage with one person, at other times two people
(or more) could exist as if on a basketball court, whereby
bleachers would exist on either side of the main area
1) this could involve a central stage with two bleacher wings,
splayed out facing an audience as if vanishing perspective
2) else it could be an actual school gymnasium with large
bleachers where a theatric performance takes place
see: concept for stage design and structure for play
here is the idea. people in the bleachers are surveillers,
they may either sit on the sidelines, and then aspects of
the play could move in parallel in these other dimensions
(geospatial, store tracking, license scanning, credit card
history, database mining and advertising, listening to calls
and keyword mapping, metadata, tracking receipts, etc)
in version 1 (above) they would then be functioning the
_background, otherwise invisible to the people in the center
of their daily lives, behind this hidden threshold of rules, laws,
language that forbids understanding of this condition at the
same time it defines the existence and actions of the people
warping or skew of data, the hypocrisy of tracking details by
companies or reselling of data, public-private profit strategies,
extortion, blackmail, political abuse, marketing, web adverts,
social network mapping, any of this commentary introduced
into this position of the actors at center stage as they relate
with others, such as using the phone or a computer, as this
links to people or topics, 'feedback' as various events occur
in version 2 (above) the same dynamics could occur though
with plants in the audience, sitting amongst others in the
bleachers, perhaps people wearing all black suits, dark
glasses, holding strange equipment, and instructions for
those in the bleachers to relay messages (the telephone
game) where a signal is passed along regular routes and
thus input is transformed by output, then passing this data
back into the play, as improvisation. for instance, a "secret"
could be passed into the bleachers by an informant, and
then by a defined route, 10 or 15 people in a given line or
sequence (marked by graphics) could be part of this flow
of data, having to relay what they heard one to the next,
to get the data to the black suited mystery people, and
thus the message they receive is then output as signal
back into the play, to those center stage or others who
are inacting with it, such that 'traveling to sign-ville' then
becomes 'unraveling the dollar bill' when later output, etc
thus, this kind of conceptual format would allow creative
expression and exploration of issues, perhaps it would
be best and most informed by technical consultation
with privacy or security and-or other experts, including
data from those surveilled, such that a larger sense of
what this involves could be sketched for citizens so that
its impact and importance could be gauged in a context
of daily living, to what extent this data gathering and this
tracking and watching is going on, and what principles it
is currently be driven by and how laws do not exist that
can constrain its functioning against citizens day to day,
and that everyday situations involve these dimensions
and issues of privacy, security, and such exploitations
playwrights have the unique skills to convey such
cultural messages and raise consciousness, and do it
in a memorable and intriguing and innovative way. where
is the equivalent of the Snowden of playwrights, perhaps
such a format could be reinterpreted by a dozen or more
playwrights, from varying angels or degrees or settings.
what if the structure is modular, and can add, subtract,
or modify the ideas of other plays using this structure,
and thus open or free source the play for interpretative
exploration and development. it is the information and
the perspective that is important, the truth of what is
going on. theaters are places for living ideas, not the
continual regurgitation of those dead and lifeless as if
highest value or truth. there is missing data of today,
who is willing to approach to present and convey what
it involves, using all the resources available to transmit
important information and ideas, start and sustain the
conversation beyond its existing, stifling boundaries
freedom does not exist if it is not made use of. and
it goes away if seeking permission to do something,
because somewhere along the line it may involve risk.
but isn't it worth trying to do something and seeing what
the real situation is, and then knowing from that, then to
not even try, not even do anything, and supposed to know
by not taking it on, accepting defeat without ever fighting
there have got to be some playwrights willing to take
on these issues. if they exist, hopefully so, it would be
interesting to see what such plays involve in their content
and approaches to conveying and conceptualizing issues
of cyberspace, hacking, surveillance, attacks, and so on

a few observations related to the video presentation:
1) often hear issues about legitimacy of mass surveillance in relation to
'targeted surveillance' as delineator, whereby legitimate targeting is
afforded to actual threats to the state and its required security measures
that likely involves way more in the realm of reasoning and undocumented
information than people are aware of, to determine whether or not a threat
exists and if such measures are necessary in terms of state security.
thus, surveilling of individuals who are problematic (either as actual foes
- aka terrorists, dangerous criminals, spies - or those wrongly-categorized
though falling into this same catch-all category) yet where oversight or
high fidelity review may not exist and thus reasoning may be weak for who
is targeted along with those who are legitimate threats.
meaning: in the talk the group or category of 'Muslims' were mentioned as
surveillance targets, though perhaps not all of these, yet in relation to
profiling, it would suggest mass surveillance could exist in certain
communities moreso than in others. in that the individual scales into a
group target, the weighting of probability perhaps moving higher in certain
demographic characteristics shared as part of a threat model outline. so
too, activists against business interests and so on, depending upon how
privatized the surveillance model is, what it is being used for, how it is
leveraged for political agendas, etc.
and so oftentimes in the mainstream viewpoint it tends to be that the
targets that tend towards some fraction of 1% of the population are likely
legitimate targets (say, 0.00001%) so that, as an example, a US population
of 314 million people has around 3,139 actual threats that would justify
surveillance measures in terms of their violent activities that threaten to
undermine the state or pursue terrorist actions against the population
(unless false flag engineered, etc).
and here is my contention with this view, and how a category such as
'ethnicity' or 'religion' may indicate there are other potential dynamics
that legitimate mass surveillance, and so it may be a fallacy to uphold
this perspective, that only some fraction of 1% are justifiable for
targeted surveillance and not dragnets over the entire population--
because, what if instead the threat involves an invading force, an
occupation, where the opponent tends towards 30% to more than 50% or more,
so that it could be 150 million people and those they are related to that
require tracking and further analysis. and that this is the more likely
threat model, in certain scenarios, depending on how it is calculated. and
could also exist as a paradox, where 'both sides' use the same or similar
surveillance to track opponents, though with different ends such that the
NSA is not a monolithic ideological organization and could be involved in a
deception campaign whereby there is a 'sandbox' for a pretend-NSA operating
as if the NSA, inside the larger organization and this is the context for
issues of who is surveilled, how surveillance is occurring, state- and
world-level honey traps, bear traps, monster traps, and so on.
in plain sight i think there are conditions of a civil war at world scale
and this is the threat model, and there is rotten surveillance that is
driven by the corrupt state, and a surrogate or pretend-NSA at the helm,
itself corrupted yet also contained, and then another threat model that is
monitoring all of this activity via surveillance at the scale of 50% or
greater of the population, in great and intricate detail, that remains
legitimate. and so, a vast forward strategy yet that is invisible, and a
smaller corrupt forward strategy that will be made visible in its
corruption. (set(subset)) dynamics.
in that this complex approach maps to military strategy of the early into
late 20th century, including the aftermath of WWII and politics of Vietnam
war in cultural terms extended into the present, and in terms of
{superset}, millennia of strategic planning likewise, setting up a false
order in order to take it down in an open-source context of Armageddon.
2) it seems bizarre that NSA activities are confined to computer technology
and there is yet no mention of behavioral dimensions to hacking, including
neurological attacks using em tools and weaponry. in that psychologists,
neurologists, psychiatrists and others vital information to hacking people
who are targeted, to program or force into disrepair. for instance, certain
chemicals can enter into the body via food supply and then be triggered via
signals and electromagnetic fields, activating them via remote switch.
chemicals in food supply then like junk dna that allows such custom
targeting at a distance, say via hostile management of infrastructure,
beyond normal rules, boundaries. the realm of mindwarfare and psychological
war, information operations at the covert level _must be tied to this same
NSA infrastructure manipulation if existing and attacking populations, yet
why is it disregarded as part of this context, why is the very direct
connection between EM tech and EM human physiology disregarded a priori as
an attack vector and not dealt with in the human rights context it should
exist within by default, if made readily aware that such dynamics are
inherent- not anomaly - to this aggressive surveillance, goals of behavior
modification, etc.
3) this leads to the issue of how this technology is fielded. if it exists,
the quickest and most distribributed, efficient route for an eight-mile
distant attack would be the cellular tower infrastructure that already
exists. that would turn it from a manual operation with field agents on
site or locally, to an issue of remote administration of these tools and
their automation, such that any person (tending towards 50% of population
model, say) could be attacked, and that it is not a tiny fraction and
instead every single device that could be scaled to the highest threat
model as need be, and thus whatever tools exist to do this would need to
exist in a context of mass surveillance, not individual cases that are few
and far between, because if that is not the nature of the actual threat,
why would tools be restricted in their use to a less-than-necessary
deployment. and thus automated infrastructure deployment seems probable in
this regard.
4) in this way, so too, neurological weaponry and behavior modification
hacking tools would likely coexist in a similar context if deployed and in
use, much more serious than attacking inert tools and equipment. attacking
peoples - citizens - nervous systems and minds, driving people into ill
health or conditions of psychological/physiological torture via these same
technical means, perhaps a sub-branch of NSA or co-use via CIA special
programs or other military venture, yet hostile to citizenry, operating in
a faulty or infallible threat model, exploited by onesided politics of
hidden  dictatorship and so on. that level of realism does not yet exist
though certainly some measure of these hostile tools exist hidden within
the same infrastructure - deployed and leveraged by the corrupt overseers,
so when will Snowden or other documents enter into the neurological and
other health aspects of hacking, cracking, pwnage, etc. that is, invisible
death squads sitting like chess pieces on the city grid, awaiting orders to
attack via next hostile moves, &c.

5) another realization upon hearing the 30c3 talk of Jacob Appelbaum
was the 'earth firewall' then indicates that the NSA controls the internet,
and that it is not operating as a subset within it, and instead everything
that occurs is within its domain....
the earlier belief, even in context of Arpanet origins...
    ( "the Internet" (NSA activities) )
when instead, a more realistic scenario in terms of who controls the
technical infrastructure, aka the foundation of cyberspace...
     NSA (the internet)
this makes a world of difference, because then national networks and
technological development occur 'inside' the framework of NSA and it
essentially governs or manages production of equipment, backdoors
installed, and if corrupt, loss of law within that same context that can
and does served warped political goals, attacking political opponents,
dissidents, those against the ruling ideology. technology allowing this.
    NSA (the internet (countrycodes) )
in this way, a corrupt NSA with dictatorial agenda could have established
default control, and enact, develop, extend hidden political organization
via secret or overt manipulations that gain and secure, solidify power yet
which exist beyond law, 'external governance', even within the state itself
    NSA is god, essentially. having rooted earth and its inhabitants.
    // if technical jargon is correct for a non-programmer
   ...and yet does not observe external truth, adhere to or recognize
   shared laws of the state, the US constitution, and other agreements
   that bind the state to its people, in service, versus in exploitation.
in this way, state violence could be automated, mechanized against
populations that somehow believe the NSA is contained and not the
entity doing the containing. like there is an unrecognized role-reversal
by the corrupt entity in a power grab related to hidden, secret US coup

it is my belief that 'context is everything' applies to the review
of these same issues and ideas, especially: location^3
consider issues of mass surveillance and mass deployment
of technical means and measures, for saturation potential so
that getting to the target is a non-issue, zero cost essentially
once installed (the role of infrastructure, resolving such issues
by providing a managed platform that readily automate tasks)
consider 'integrated surveillance' tools and capabilities in a
blackbag context. really think a fleet of a 100 tempest vans
exist in every city, or do the economics work against this as
a scalable approach and require instead cellular towers or
wi-fi antennas as a base for such activities to occur. and if
this were possible, would it not be integrated to N-degrees
of capability? consider electronic door locks in a context of
black bag jobs. what if a remote software command could
more easily unlock a car via cellular tower than a person,
and invisibly, (this prior to them driving you off the road in
autonomous or driverless vehicles, exciting future awaits)
so is psychological warfare and other information operations
by default assumed to involve teams on the ground or is it
potentially seamlessly integrated with existing infrastructure
and streamlined as another protocol layer that can or will be
deployed as or if needed, in terms of threat escalation and
what is legitimated in the given corrupt/illegal approach. if
assuming it involves people going from point A to B there
is little likelihood of these activities being deployed at the
scale of mass surveillance, and yet if infrastructure itself,
there is high likelihood or it is probable that they could be
made economical and exist as a potential to be used as
weapons against populations though may only target a
few individuals in the existing context, potentially, thus
0.00001% for more extreme and oppressive measures
may be accurate, in that what is hacked becomes the
person themselves, say via forced disease triggering or
whatnot, as part of this context of hostile surveillance
that in active and passive ways could still be deadly,
just slow drip, over time, versus out-in-the-open where
such attacks could be documented, proven to exist

In practice, it is pretty obvious that most practitioners of civil
It seems in practice that there is a relation issue involved in
who judges and determines lawfulness in the shared situation.
oftentimes, the person who judges is actually 'the criminal' and
can "represent the state" and 'the people' though misleadingly,
subverting this relation. such that, a person who exists within
and operates in a criminal way, including relying upon lies as
a day to day framework, then convicts those who may break
one law or tell one lie in their lives or go beyond a boundary
out of principle and larger ethics that question the ruleset
and what happens or appears to is that all the power is with
those who cheat, lie, and steal within the state along with
their accomplices, and that these people 'are the state' that
then judges and determines the fate of otherwise law-abiding
citizens or those who seek to serve its best interests, not least
by enforcing its framework or utilizing its freedoms, testing the
parameters only to find they are not observed, are fiction only
(else, perhaps other more active strategies exist though are
correct in principle, in not adhering to laws that are inaccurate
or overbearing and allow the corruption its continuing power)
what this is to suggest is that the judge-convicted relation is:
    99.99% falsity + 0.01% truth   vs.  99.99% truth + error
(in that the evaluation occurs in a warped framework where
judgement is divorced from its own adherence to truth, via
the same corrupted constitution that allows for this relation)
    99% wrong  ---> judgement ---> 0.01% wrong
and yet this viewpoint (based on power) is itself based upon
LIES and deception, unaccountable to the same rules and
thus is beyond law. and thus it _must show falsity in another

secret dictatorship triumph in these conditions, because it
is beyond accountability, it is just about believing in higher
power that is based on lies and opinions, as it filters down
into culture via illiteracy, loss of education, social relations,
normalization of vice, oppression, exploitation, criminality
this is why the state must be abolished, because it has
become thoroughly rotten from the inside out due to the
outdated source code that provides loopholes to oppress
citizens and humans and the planet and animals worldwide
due to loss of truth, and making this lying 'legal' as a basis
for 'shared power' by who shares and is in on the lie, as this

i was thinking about 'hidden powerline networking' as a threat
the other day. basically anything that could be plugged into a
socket with hidden one-way networking on chip, that would
be able to siphon network data or use as a sensor or bug &
send this data into a larger circuit, say apartment electrical
wires that could be picked up remotely as frequencies that
are outside ordinary spec, at another onsite location such
that a device simply is plugged into the same site to reveal
or tap into the data. i imagine this is completely TRIVIAL
to accomplish, especially due to no regulatory/enforcement
or consumer protections in a security or commercial context
as it aids surveillance goals, especially in political framework
of secret policing, informers, etc. spying by the populations.
such that anything with a cord potentially could feed such
data, if designed this way. speakers or router or monitor or
printer or clock or lights or blender or microwave, etc. and
that it could seem innocuous, yet have this capacity or this
'surveillance potential' (as in, potential energy vs. applied),
such that grassroots on-site monitoring could be aided and
abetted likewise by such technological compromise, this
in terms of intent and design or perhaps not revealed or
deployed though part of a COT readymade solution that
just requires smd circuitry add-ons to activate functionality
this could be a stupid-model, versus smart expert systems
or total monitoring solutions, the dust mote approach that
leads towards a *density* of surveillance means/measures

Kono said superfluorescence is a well-known many-body, or cooperative,
phenomenon in atomic physics. Many-body theory gives physicists a way
to understand how large numbers of interacting particles like
molecules, atoms and electrons behave collectively. Superfluorescence
is one example of how atoms under tight controls collaborate when
triggered by an external source of energy. //...
"The quantum well, as before, consisted of stacked blocks of an indium
gallium arsenide compound separated by barriers of gallium arsenide.
"It's a unique, solid-state environment where many-body effects
completely dominate the dynamics of the system," Kono said.
"When a strong magnetic field is applied, electrons and holes are
fully quantized – that is, constrained in their range of motion—just
like electrons in atoms," he said. "So the essential physics in the
presence of a high magnetic field is quite similar to that in atomic
gases. But as we decrease and eventually eliminate the magnetic field,
we're entering a regime atomic physics cannot access, where continua
of electronic states, or bands, exist." [unquote]

so would this not break the physics model already, of faster than light info,
such that the cosmos may operate on principles beyond those employed.
the comments on the article seemingly indicative of this same scenario,
as if a realm of political science, gerrymandering of physics seemingly.
if a spin could be remotely connected to another, as mentioned in the
article comments, and activated at a distance, could this not function
as a basic switch, perhaps making a relay or gate or some kind or the
ability to send/receive coded messages via morse code (as mentioned).
say, a sequence of spins encoding the alphabet or whatever, perhaps
controlled by a normal computer process yet transmitted/received via
this quantum connectivity (seemingly out of this world then back into it
via vibration, rather than a line of sight acoustic signal, if understanding)
i thought that was the idea underneath the potential for other, hidden
technology embedded in existing systems, that remote relationship
via quantum properties that operate in other dimensionality/structures,
if not beyond lightspeed properties or conceptions, and that it may not
be recognizable in the existing approach or computational paradigm.
such that fiber may not be necessary, the approach to key exchange

it also makes me wonder, given the insane speed vs. infinitesimal distance
if *information* could operate as a kind of cognitive pressure on the mind,
(as with predictive Random Event Generator (REG) vs RNG where patterns
organize/emerge out of quantum-noisefield) thus corollary perhaps to the
analogy of water pressure for electrical circuits and flow based on pneuma-
tic dynamics in a potentially bounded or closed system). that may enter
into questions of 'where information actually exists', perhaps stored outside
the brain in noosphere as patterns or forms (invisible constellation/structure)
that is referenced or linked to rather than contained within a brain, and thus
boundary of brain vs. mind. same: digital computer vs.quantum processor,
perhaps. thus issue of channeling or tuning into versus as origin of truth.
what if a fundamentally different data model, thus security model, etc.
this conceptualization has the individual person modeled as an antenna,
tuning into various structures based on what resonates, aligns correctly,
what circuits or feedback loops or environments exist. versus machine

@_subject: EM-nature (was: infra-org) 
i need to make note of this observation because it has special
relevance for the present situation of shared observation regarding
'information operations' (or other) that occur and-or are analyzed
within a particular context, framework, conceptualization. because
there is a split in worldview and modeling between the animal realm
whereby the sonar of bats or directional navigation of birds become
detached in their EM abilities from similar non-recognized natural
abilities in humans, which are 'off the map' so to speak, in terms
of a general awareness and recognition of similar EM physiology.
in other words, 'the senses' of humans are detached from their
electromagnetic context that would unify a model of humanity
(to be discussed at some later time) with such EM nature and
provide context for both a healthy relation and toxic conditions.
though this remains unrecognized via a political agenda that
prevents such data beyond its protected ideological boundary,
thus effects of wi-fi or artificial radiation (radio, etc) on human
beings is categorized into a realm of personal 'mental illness'
and unrelated to issues of cancer, at the same time EM tools
(nuclear resonance) are used to treat the ~mystery disease.
it is a split between mind-body that is enforced institutionally,
disallowing EM viewpoint while leveraging its onesidedness
against dumbed-down populations, unable to reason within
the warped frameworks about what is going on, because the
cause and effect have been separated, plausibly denied. in a
context of 'information operations' and 'electronic warfare' this
involves a realm of ~supernatural-like events that thus cannot
be accounted for in a non-electromagnetic context or view,
such that it cannot be 'rationally' reasoned with beyond a
realm of forced hysteria, as if dealing with ghosts/demons,
versus technological infrastructure operating in other realms.
thus security, defense, attacks are in a realm of "beliefs"
that are detached from a shared understanding/knowledge
of the environment these events are operating/occurring within,
like magic or witchcraft or sorcery, exfiltrating data and then
using a god-status to manipulate peoples lives - now this is
the power of government that is beyond oversight, law itself.
entire realms of ideological attackers then can be aligned in
such a ~wildwest scenario as if a replay of cowboys/indians,
the model for basic exchange moves towards highway robbery
in this same approach, detached from the actual condition that
exists, unable to speak about it or confirm it, as with physics
that supposedly "define" reality at the material level yet which
are byzantine and disconnected views that disallow reasoning
and observation while seeking to represent, have control over it
as ideology - this massive obfuscation the success of relativism.
so that nothing and only nothing can be discussed and the left
is rest for experts. in this way, silence is enforced via ideology
that is actually _detached from nature yet claims to represent it
and so to the mind and imagination and body of humans, these
as they are detached from the environment they exist within as
this becomes the basis for exploitation, predator/prey relations
at the level of politics of the rogue state, homicidal government.
in this way little can be said or done without being discredited
for going 'beyond the lines' that are dutifully enforced by the
protectors and defenders of the corrupt ideology, this boundary
is what needs to stand, the misrepresentation and malmodeling
of existence so that _reason cannot occur in accurate terms,
mathematics (of zero) and michelson-morley experiment (as
if simple debunk of aether) and removal of the absolute from
all equations, then acting and believing as if this is NORMAL
when it is fundamentally unreal as to shared experience and
observation of known and knowable facts and observations.
instead it becomes about what is allowed via a viewpoint
that can remain secure while allowing other views to exist,
within certain parameters yet truth is lost in this confinement
to a finite, overcontrolled, self-interested, skewed interaction,
whereby "nothingness" continually replaces "being" as the
shared condition, while those administering technology can
further apply and ply their craft and trade against and upon
humans, while humans have no effect on this relationship,
it is a bias that is enforced by dark ages restrictions upon
thought, held within an outdated view, stagnation of beliefs
for hundreds if not thousands of years of knowledge (basic
amber and lodestone fundamentals continually extended,
technologized) whereby even the fact that the atmosphere
itself is full of charge is irrelevant to those whose interest
is in technology, as if the 'data model' for information only
exists in artificial media and not within EM nature itself,
that beings could be interacting and formatted the shared
environment like the r/w head of a harddrive via mind, yet
the considerations never go outside the skull or beyond
the 'expert models' that bound this to the brain instead.
as if people cannot be allowed to think for themselves
or perhaps know far more than "beliefs" of scientists
allow via its enforcement of a corrupt political ideology,
where this bias against accurate human representation
that gives rise and momentum to an antihuman agenda,
a religious belief system that is biased against humans
as this is turned into infrastructure, tools, government.
and at its core is nothingness. falsity, lies. not truth.
it is language games. it is disregard for, exploitation
of logic whereby proofs are unneeded, never checked-
beyond language in its ungrounded condition and this
very comprehensiveness is itself based on absolutism,
where 'it cannot be known' becomes this absolute truth
simultaneously denied by the same political priesthood
whose goal is to mislead, misdirect, to keep us enslaved
in a false worldview, model, "physics" detached from reality
the disconnection of accurate understanding of the mind,
as if we cannot be allow to think or know consciousness
even, outside the scientific technological evaluation within
a biased modeling, then forbids accurate connection and
evaluation with the electromagnetic body, nervous system,
senses, in terms of awareness, reasoning, truth itself as
it relates to information (and security) beyond 'the brain',
and all the senses in their variability as they are unified
and not kept separate within human and other entities.
yet this wholeness is illegal as an identity, observation
is forcibly denied, the perspective directly challenges
the technical and ideological and political advantage of
those using these warped harmful tools and exploits
against the population, to continue their illegal control
over events to the deterioration of earth, its inhabitants
when truth is outlawed there is no way to 'reason' about
such conditions. they are penalized as viewpoints and
this defines a boundary condition or protected threshold
of different values, economic/political/social interests
that separate, some mind and bodies benefit for this
while others must suffer as a result of ongoing deception.
for some it is their security model, this obfuscated realm.
for others, humans, it is the basis for insecurity, torment,
disconnection for action and ability, realism, truth itself
thus reality is legislated away by others who stand in
for the law, on their own terms, for their own benefit
while others must suffer for this to be sustained, yet
if some take on more suffering via self-sacrifice, this
condition could be fundamentally transformed, given
rules of operation changed, hacked, short-circuited
and switched into other circuits, functionality, and
then the situation becomes increasing interesting
worldwide, as unified understanding takes control,
governed by shared service to truth, firstly, finally

for instance, if the mathematics of zero is off, then use
of such equations reliant on this modeling are going to
bound observations into a realm of perpetual inaccuracy
as a basis for worldview and 'physics' itself
likewise, if politically expedient, within this boundary,
a model of relativism can continually be reinforced via
these mathematics, it further provides a framework that
declares a particular reality to be the shared situation,
even if this goes against common sense, experience,
truth, and knowledge. physics then determining it as
if judge, jury, ultimately executioner of 'bad thinking'
because it does not conform to the inaccurate model
such as astronomers believing goats ruled earth
from the moon or whatever other such beliefs, if
enforced and stopping other direct observations
because they do not conform to the belief system
much more accurate in a charged atmosphere that
we are beings are _submerged in an information
environment, a realm of invisible circuitry that has
fundamental relation to pattern and constellations
of data, models that repeat as concepts and ideas,
and where do these reside, only inside of brains?
this is why the jellyfish seemed a useful analogy,
a floating sentience suspended in an information
rich environment that then is mediated, tuned into,
related to and through within certain dimensionality
that may change from one being, species to the next
and yet some fundamental condition is also shared,
held in common, this is the electromagnetic context
that is _undocumented in both nature and humans
as a continuous circuit throughout the cosmos from
the beginning of its existence to peak development
of life and sentience unfolding at its very edge, that
is where consciousness is operating, alive, interface
to reality and able to reflect upon this condition
yet without a unified model, EM cosmography
necessary before EM cosmology, seemingly, to
consider EM nature in relation to EM lifeforms,
and then EM humans and EM technology within
this realm, as 'consciousness' and concepts like
code, programming, 'artificial intelligence' are
inherently related to this condition in its truth,
yet completely separated from it due to a non-
electromagnetic worldview, understanding, as
if computers invented and 'contain' charge vs.
everything containing charge in a given realm,
plants, animals, the air, tools, bodies, minds.
the circuit itself not even a concept beyond
the manufactured circuitboard in terms of a
diagrammatic approach to reasoning, that is
processing of reality and decision-making,
such that perhaps this too is about circuits,
and we cannot reason or communciate in
the way we actually think, via patterns as
our worldview is disconnected from them,
from our own observation, and made into
signs instead, held apart from geometry,
other structural relations and evaluations
that may predate or provide foundation
for more ornate descriptions thereafter
yet these fundamentals are not secured
and instead lost in a non-EM evaluation,
as if 'writing to write' or 'coding to code' is
a higher connectivity or awareness when
instead it is a further detachment from the
fundamentals, truth in its logical evaluation
needed to secure the modeling, test and
correct for errors, the obligation ignored,
denied for a simple, quicker lost cause,
moving in the wrong direction, forgetting
to listen to the compass built-into the
self, of the electromagnetic directionality,
its connection with this cosmic condition
and the naturalness and unity, harmony
that could exist with people, environment,
tools, instead ignored, disease, disharmony
and falsity taking the place of enlightenment
then to speak of anything detached from this
condition as if encompassing it in a too small,
finite worldview, believing infinity can be pre-
packaged into a confined condition and then
held there as mode of control over it, versus
freeing the infinity truth and human reasoning,
challenging the concepts and regulations of
'discourse' and 'institutionalization of views',
to achieve this greater accuracy, _security
instead becomes the very problem that must
be combated to defend, uphold the criminal
falsity and deception of a false worldview,
false reality, false perspective, false beliefs
that are normalized, enforced, dictated
in this way what is anything in its truth
without this electromagnetic context as
the foundation for its evaluation, and this
in all its dimensionality, not compartmented
into narrowed controlled categories that are
the basis for its denial via social protocols
that seek to uphold a given social order that
does not serve or seek this greater truth and
instead desires to substitute it, stand-in for it,
as guardians though of the false, nothingness
code, crypto in this context, tools, computers,
programming, reasoning, processing, thought,
security, insecurity, tyranny, freedom, laws
how do you move from infinite parallel worlds
in relativistic conditions into a single shared
empirical framework in varying dimensionality
via quantum conditions without EM-nature?
how do you do this if the mathematics do not
allow it. or an absolute framework is not allowed
within reasoning via the ideology of relativism as
it has been detached from logical accounting
beyond the binary onesided belief of ideology.
what if the model of information survives death,
that like energy, if information is attached to it
as pattern in some way, whether morphic fields
or other conceptual forms or formatting, patterns
that even these computer conversations could
already be occurring interdimensionally, beyond
given thresholds yet not perceived locally this way.
none of it can be rationalized if the foundation for
the worldview is off, wrong, fundamentally incorrect
and there is every indication that this is the case,
yet further, that it purposeful, to maintain control
over events by denying the true nature of reality
and seeking to control and exploit this against
human populations, for their political subjugation
that is driven by evil intent, exampled everywhere
then to communicate or talk in this realm as if
it is not happening, beyond the pale to mention
as if craziness. that is threshold of the different
groundings, the ruling ideology based on falsity
all its circuitry open to hacking and cracking,

i am completely intrigued and at once baffled by this, wondering
of Code here is referencing code in a wider generic sense or is
restricted to computer coding as the parameters. the examples
given {whistling, baying} seem both in a realm of music/voicing
and movement {gesture} and these all could be contained within
a context of language, seemingly. or perhaps not, as envisaged.
what has me further curious is if this somehow has linguistics
(as crypt.crypto) advantaged to mathematics, as communication
framework in some wider more open or elusive sense, or as the
conception/conceptualization of what code is or may be if crypto
i am still trying to ground with electromagnetic framework thus
imagining beyond this, as if already grounded, more unknowing
of how to even consider such thoughts or considerations as it
difficult or impossible to separate from the medium involved in
my naive and limited awareness and even less understanding
closest to this perhaps in this not-knowing what might be is
that the cosmos itself is encrypted, as a starting point to
questioning, context for developing technical crypt.boxes
then perhaps DNA as encrypted code of life in this framework,
taxonomy of species and disciplines decrypting the patterning,
securing truth key to unlocking the works seemingly, OZ writer
L. Frank Baum naming electromagnetism as the master key,
wondering if it is actually a blank, then what that implies, or if
parameters exist by which it can be made to unlock access
to new dimensions in which this otherness is more tangible,
maybe a realm exists outside of charge, here not the case

== note on crypto ==
wondering if a distinction could be made in the realm of cryptology as
with other disciplines whereby there is an existing functionality and
then an edge condition of developing ideas where intuitions may be
pursued, tested, learned from.
i see people in various disciplines working on 'ideas' as part of
their work, whereas the same tasks can be pursued in purely
functional, managerial terms likewise, perhaps involving an existing
mode of operation versus evaluating various parameters or potential
in some sense then, as with art, there are artists who have skills and
can develop their work within a given set of parameters, and others
who may be more abstract and involved in this abstraction at the level
of ideas, questioning of existing presumptions. i relate this
condition and pursuit to 'conceptual art', rightly and-or wrongly,
having only an intuitive understanding of what it involves versus art
historical accounts of what it means and how it is identified.
then, so too with music. there are some who perform and develop music
within traditional or known parameters, and others who test or
question the limits though also in a deep realm of ideas. and this
tends towards 'conceptual music' in my sensibility, because more is
involved than what may be discerned from the aesthetics and it may
take more to understand it as it may operate in different parameters
than what is already known, and may need evaluation within a different
sensibility to access what it involves, which may center on grounding
of ideas or conceptions beyond a given interpretation, model, or limit
in standard approaches.
this then relating also to the rich realm of conceptual architecture,
typology seemingly having a unique role in this (ex. architects
Boullée and Ledoux from the enlightenment era when studying ruins and
the discipline of archaeology began, if remembering correctly, moving
into another realm perhaps tending towards the surreal compared to
existing approaches)...
(note: relation of Cenotaph for Newton and nuclear reactor, containing
fission of sun inside building type, significance for evaluating
landscape, environment, meaning, symbolism)
it is as if 'ideas' and their contemplation was more readily at the
center of questioning, the basis for what is developed, less so than
unquestioned conventions repeated as patterns. and this continued as a
major approach, including Le Corbusier and others, within certain
parameters, though a 'high conceptualization' can be involved in an
activity that in the griops of other practitioners is merely a
functional question that has already proscribed solutions that can be
uniquely or methodically rearranged though perhaps not fundamentally
questioned. so in some sense the fundamentals or basis or foundational
and its basics are secured and relied upon or brought into question
and further tested, experimented with, refined, or moved beyond
perhaps in particular circumstances as a model or approach.
this conceptualization continued into the 1960s (such as Archigram)
into the 1980s though its purpose seemed to be made profane, focused
on the image as a basis for abstraction, and the deeper questions of
architecture ignored for a shallow aesthetic approach that can be
hollow or ungrounded from 'reality' in some significant sense,
detached from issues and people and of a realm of CAD design, as if
architecture is only industrial design, creating pleasing objects or
sculpture devoid of economic, social, political, cultural issues it
involves, its deep meaning and insight, and instead, developing
blindness. this is more anti-architecture, the concept is not about
ideas but about extending an ideology of a particular warped value
system, and so the image is like an illusion of what actual
architecture is, in its greater purpose and mission. not trivial, not
just manufacturing buildings or 'culture' as if a fashion item to be
copied, reproduced as a trend or style, yet that is what it has
devolved to in tersm of its 'ideas', in many or most cases- if just on
its detachment from understanding nature itself and people and serving
these interests instead of designing building as part of a
political-economic flow that aestheticizes an existing and harmful way
of life, yet makes it as enticing as possible. (in this way the
excellent observation of such 'architecture' as pornographic forms, as
introduced by Dr. Elisabeth von Samsonow in The Plasticity of the Real
video lecture.)
i tend to consider this earlier intersection between archeology and
architecture vital for understanding both disciplines in their
interrelated depth, bridging past and future, and asking questions
again in a different context than just a present mode of operation.
thus to question and learn from ruins or evaluate a situation in a
larger context than it may otherwise have due to convention. and it
appears a lot is lost to narrowed conception of processes and existing
functioning that may limit potentials for insight and innovation
beyond the existing boundaries, again due to convention if not
conforming to rules or patterns or models that may already work in the
given constraints or parameters- though these too also change and
transform over time, yet the 'ideas' attached to them do not, and
often approaches can become fixed ideas or conceptions, as if the
world does not change becomes a routine is continued the same, even
while everything is shifting underneath yet may be unrecognized in a
given approach or even denied, to retain a way of doing things and
thinking, beliefs, etc.
so, a potential exists and perhaps it is like basic research of
architecture or a given discipline, where it may not be ready to be
applied or may question fundamental assumptions and this is purposeful
and can be extraordinarily beneficial if it cracks open the
malmodeling that may become standardized as approach, and allow other
development to occur by falsifying given notions or providing
alternative paths or techniques. and yet also, infrastructure can
exist that forbids this from occurring, that limits any such
conceptions, or confines questioning to what amounts to only small
tweaks in the functional circuitry because it is a situation that is
nearly completely controlled and there is little room within for
fundamental changes and an entire system would need to be rebuilt from
scratch to replace what exists, otherwise. and there are dreamers who
do this, and architects who focus on utopia. or modeling of cities.
Frank Lloyd Wright (FLlW) had his vision for the development of the US
which was based on a different approach to city planning,
democratizing it via planning principles if not mistaken, though part
of this was developing a low-cost affordable home (if not made of
concrete), the USonian home, a unit or component in the larger
integrated plan of massive development. Le Corbusier had skyscrapers
and green spaces as part of the Ville Radieuse (my memory is gone
though approximating a general sketch of approaches) and both these
efforts were based on social goals, what architecture and master
planning can effect via focused development. and Arcosanti by Paolo
Soleri is yet another example, building a prototype community with new
building techniques as part of a larger vision that is potentially
counterpoint to the existing approach, and that there is a tradition
of this questioning of existing development patterns and yet it is
also fraught with issues in the realm of ideas as relativism bounds
such inquiry.
for accuracy it should be noted that this innovation in thinking has
basically evaporated from the practice of architecture, it is
completely without support as a research endeavor in the given model
of education and development, as if the technical approach + aesthetic
fashion is the peak sum of its content as fixed-idea, though it is
more a purification of given ideology intimately tied to existing
warped economic, social, political agendas evidenced as "culture" that
is antihuman, against nature, against thought, essentially
anti-architecture as it exists.
so the conceptual potential of architecture, the critical questioning
of assumptions can be lost or drown out by other priorities or values,
superseded by a particular view or agenda that in turn limits what can
be pursued in that domain, as it becomes normalized, made a shared
worlview, institutionalized. yet likewise, detached from fundamentals
edited or censored out of existence given the tyranny of convention or
otherwise, e.g. deceptive motivations.
and so at the edge of development, there could be little blood
occurring because there is no real-stake involved at this leading or
front position. it could be somewhat mundane or basic or commonplace,
detached from significance or risk, and more about continuing to
extend a particular approach than testing, questioning, learning and
pivoting into other unknown or newly discovered realms via discovery,
innovation, invention, failure even and falsfication of beliefs and
approaches. defeat of ideology. instead- there are no ideas,
potentially. just the same old beliefs repeated ad naseum yet without
questioning them again and again, thus to assume their rightness or
correctness through their repetition, no more integrity than that.
thus mediocrity as a type of security even, doing what has been done
as a validation process or confirmation of value, matching a pattern
as pattern and not its truth it must represent. and thus the
detachment, the moving away from what is vital, developing in the
wrong ways and directions towards a false viewpoint and framework, if
not at odds with what is needed. and this all occurs automatically-
especially in peoples minds and thinking, psychologies and relations,
as individuals and groups then combine into organizations, continuing
such efforts.
conceptual architecture is then about ideas. thinking through
architecture, architecture as a model, a medium for ideas. for
communication and relation. the importance of language in all the
above examples, and its fundamental relation to geometry (art, music,
architecture). and this fundamental consideration also involving a
kind of philosophical approach to the questioning, in terms of
research, the basics, fundamentals, foundation of disciplines and
beliefs, techniques approaches actions, methodology. questioning,
debate, discussion, the role of basic research in development, its
application over time via refinement, testing of hypotheses and
improvement of models and approaches. it is not just engineering
and it also involves a larger domain than just a detail, so while
research into concrete may always be ongoing, that concrete sidewalk
technology around for thousands of years since Roman times, the heated
sidewalk or improved wear or illumination or concrete via other
additives to the mixture is not in itself a larger modeling of the
depth and breadth of the question of architecture beyond that narrowed
realm- though can be incorporated into it as a vital detail, and so
definitely is related, though a part of a larger research enterprise,
a larger more encompassing and ecosystem view, where each detail has
its value and importance and insight, yet in the realm of ideas, 'big
ideas' need to occur to frame the big situations, and to limit these
to finite or specific details then bounds what can occur.  it is
equivalent to saying we can build skyscrapers to look like furniture
and if that is all it involves, a vast many other potential realms of
questioning or consideration can be lost in the process as it is
defined and conceived, in terms of what is and is not considered, put
on the table in terms of questioning. for most the skyscraper itself
as a building type has become a default solution, so too the high rise
city as a defacto approach to eco/soc/pol development, yet it is
fraught with vast many problems and creates and solidifies certain
patterns that are ineffective, inefficient, though believed the
correct way because that is the standard, the way things are done
today and how wealth or success has been generated. it is an engine,
in other words, that provides momentum to many industries and
questioning it as foundation could even be heretical. and thus if
questioning is removed, everything works just like a machine. yet a
machinery that is functioning against life, the earth, people,
economics, society, and other dimensions if a true accounting were to
take place beyond the controlled viewpoint that secures this approach.
conceptual architecture potentially could delve into these areas, yet
without support or even vital influence upon these processes, either
for being unrealistic or uneconomical or without existing capacity,
technology, or other limitations that restrict alternatives from
developing. again- the lack of research and its replacement by a
default 'ideology' the indicator that the process is determined by an
existing agenda that does not want to be fundamentally questioned in
its rightness, correctness as method, practice, income-generating
and yet an amazing discipline such as architecture can then lose its
soul, its essence, its insight and become shallow, ungrounded from
reality, and force disconnection through its development which then is
no longer actual or real architecture and instead something else, a
substitute process that stands-in for it as mimic, yet operating
within different principles that confine questioning to a narrow range
of consideration that basically destroys it, the ideas turning to
answered questions, architecture turned against itself, becoming only
a question of engineering, the art of construction being about
decorative buildings instead. though no deep insight into the human
condition beyond an archaeological condition where these forms can be
evaluated, analyzed, as they map to social, political, economic
issues, versus serving people as part of a heightened moral and
ethical obligation, service to culture and its development, not
turning away from it for money or just another career, etc. and thus
'the ideas' of architecture are nowhere to be found within the field
as it exists today, they are instead censored out of it by default of
the existing securing of ideology within institutions as this then is
the basis for further development within constrained parameters of
"design" that has more in common with the particularities of fashion
than wide-ranging investigation into questions and understanding and
development of culture in its highest manifestation, to include the
role of technology and its coherent and innovative integration within
built form, which instead becomes a manufacturers and industry
consideration: "smart homes", etc. this versus master planning of
civilization across all of its dimensions in a cohesive clear vision.
this as context for cryptography, in that there may be a standard
approach via public-key or other security systems in place that have
become normalized, made routine as processes and that assumptions may
readily exist as 'solutions' that remain bounded in given
considerations while there could be more going on beyond the existing
framework or limits of these same systems in practice, when evaluated
in terms of basic research, tweaked or tested or broken, and this
appears part of a vital process of improving and securing
cryptographic systems even. that a basic RD&D process exists already,
though to still question- within what parameters and is it possible
that the existing modeling is based on fundamental assumptions that
could in some way be limited or narrowed and a larger inquiry is
restricted because of these beliefs that become 'assumed truths' via
their restricted boundaries,  as if knowns or certainties due to
history or precedent yet these not brought back into questioning again
(reinterpreting of previous models, as if archeological ruins even,
where new insights may still be available or other approaches
discovered through their reevaluation and testing of assumptions).
it is to question if there may be a distinction made between
cryptography that is operational and active, that exists as an
infrastructure and working system (however rube-goldberg the issues of
implementation, chaos of variability as it connects with
secured/insecure modes), and what may be a more research-oriented
approach, not just into mathematical approaches to cryptographic
modules, and instead potentially further into the most basic realm of
crypto questioning, perhaps at the level of signs & symbols (language)
and how operations function (geometry) instead of an algorithm that is
operational as software approach or methodology, within a given or
existing set of parameters or assumptions that may be relied upon yet
also may be limited or even false in certain instances or deny other
approaches from occurring.
in other words, it is to wonder if there is a realm of 'conceptual
cryptology' that may already exist and yet not be defined or
understood this way, or 'conceptual cryptography' in a more particular
realm whereby these core questions of cryptographic models could be
pursued in their depth- or does the existing institutionalization of
these "ideas" restrict these inquiries due to a forced perspective of
ideology, a particular value system that relates to economic, social,
political pressures that retain a given approach for the good of
institutional control or manufacturing or to keep validating the
static conception, even as it may deteriorate within its 'ideas' made
static, assumed true by their repetition and continual access,
matching the sign equals sign as confirmation of correctness, versus
grounding in this greater depth of inquiry and realm of potential and
perpetual insight, when going back to the source and evaluating the
situation with fresh eyes and minds, in the dimensions that exist,
which could be far more than is modeled or believed or allowed in
existing approaches or functioning.
as with archaeology and architecture, it is to question if
cryptography may have a unique in situ condition at this intersection
of language and geometry, that currently may exist outside its
conceptualization in terms of practice, as crypto is developed
systematically, as it is made into infrastructure via technology,
manufacturing, and extension of these. and here, of the danger of
ideology, answered questions that move towards further falsity, as if
unconscious, when questioning of 'ideas' becomes detached from action
and through further development becomes ever more disconnected from a
fundamental condition of truth than in service to it. and what if this
integrity, securing this foundation of cryptography in truth is
requirement for security, yet given existing parameters could be
ignored in its philosophical dimensions that predate, inform, and give
life to the discipline, yet may not be valued or identified or related
to this way, as it becomes institutionalized or supported, made into
systematic development.
is there such an entity as 'conceptual cryptography' and where does it
begin and end. how might it be different than a primarily engineering
based approach or evalaution or crypto. to what extent is it supported
and operational as inquiry, yet what parameters or domain does it
occupy, including in past times and efforts that map out this
relation, its core questioning. could it today function in non-crypto
domains yet influence crypto development, etc. and thus questions of
the universality and connectedness of patterns, their permutations and
relations, potential interdisciplinary relevance as language and
geometry across mediums.
(if not involving inquiries and in-depth research at the junction and
structural intersection of linguistics and mathematics, and a
wider-range of potential communication strategies.)

== re: Amazon LCD tablet ==
i grew up studying those giant shopping catalogs for Sears and JC
Penneys stores that had inventories of everything in stores and that
could be mail ordered. they were seemingly hundreds of pages thick,
consumer bibles of specific national retailer chains in the U.S. and
for those without encyclopedia, did offer an interesting look into the
development of digital watches as they took over analog, calculators,
early computing, electronic and video games, and then 'electrics'
spanning tools to housewares, various large and small appliances.
when the Amazon Kindle lineup went from e-ink only into a
mixed-category of LCD screens it seems to blur the distinction in
purpose between the e-reader devices and more ordinary tablets that
compete with others, in particular ecosystem-based devices from Apple.
my initial thought was that there were two different categories
occupying a single name of "Kindle" and that they were functionally
very different devices with different purposes.
while it is understood that 'tablets' are a category unto themselves
and need no further justification for existence in an online retail or
software/app model, it struck me as strange that there was not
something more conceptual going on with the Amazon HD Fire devices,
beyond ordinary tablet functionality, at least from what reviews
mention about it in terms of user experience and how it streamlines
access to Amazon services through the tablet UI.
one thought has stuck with me about the potential for this
tablet-Amazon ecosystem relation and it is that this device now
competes with others in a general 'multimedia' tablet category, yet
its real and potential advantage in terms of apps or whatever is its
unique connection to Amazon inventory, which spans multimedia in an
intranet sort of way, perhaps as if portal.
from here, location, in this particular and unique context of
relation between those who access Amazon through such a tablet
interface, it would appear the killer functionality of such an LCD
tablet would be to provide 'catalog-like functionality' in the style
of earlier paper-based approaches, such as the Sears Catalog and
others, though perhaps beyond just existing approaches determined by
web interfaces and into a higher degree of functionality, such that
the tablet actually is the Amazon Catalog in electronic format, in
particular- mail-order format whereby, say, ala Whole Earth Catalog or
Hammacher Schlemmer, you could potentially order anything that Amazon
lines up into its supply-chain, even if for a one-time sale, via such
a massively connected inventory and integrated yet distributed
delivery system.
This probably sounds very bad to some peoples ears in terms of the
impact or effects this could have if suddenly Amazon is bidding on
installing pools in the neighborhood, though perhaps it would be
bounded to certain things like European appliances that are imported
or other high-rated, quality based interactions vetted by a
review-system recovered from the troubles of existing feedback
environments internet-wide.
curated merchandize, then, that is presented in deep categories of
content, with additional information (requiring dimensions of items
from manufacturers, etc) and matrix-based searching functions (using
grids and geometry to search instead of only keywords) that then are
the basis for a _new_design of the Amazon interface that standardizes
the interface and user experience with the available inventory,
instead of relying on existing web technologies to define parameters
for what can occur in these interactions, including variable results.
What this is to question is why the Amazon Fire LCD tablet is
competing in a multimedia category as if just another tablet when
instead it could be 'the Amazon Catalog' instead and while able to
deliver movies, music, book content, that ultimately a programmatic
hierarchy could exist that this is a platform for interfacing with and
accessing Amazon inventory firstly, before that secondary utility,
which allows delivery of online data (movies, movies) though also, and
primarily it is assumed: offline 'content' in terms of sales from its
warehouses and third party suppliers, and thus is the basis for
creating, sustaining, and developing this huge momentum in sales, or
having it operate in more conventional terms, competing as another
tablet in a highly competitive space, and perhaps not having this
catalog-functionality as its core mission to the extent that this is
how the tablet is designed, its fundamental purpose and advanced
functionality, versus just an extension of existing web technology
approaches that leverage an excellent e-commerce experience though
remain heavily defined by what is a very low-resolution 'catalog' of
its inventory, when instead there could be more extensive information
about each item, so that people do not need to research missing facts
or data repeatedly and instead it could be presented as advanced specs
(dimensions, materials, warnings; contains lead, requires widget Z),
that combined with expert reviews or more in-depth analysis could
transform the experience into a research-based activity where all of
the necessary data is in the Amazon Catalog, perhaps not the web
version, but the tablet catalog version that acts like an encyclopedia
attached to extended or other content or dimensions.
For instance, if a product attaches to a table, yet no information is
provided for how this connection takes place or how deep or thick the
table must be, the same item could be ordered and then returned if it
does not fit a particular table. And if this information is not
provided for in the reviews, then orders and returns are the 'feedback
process' that is in effect a negative interaction as a total exchange,
inefficient, and time-wasting for everyone when instead that
additional information which could be known to be critical (no less by
the product manufacturer) could be provided as _missing detail in the
current approach, in many cases, with sales across the online retailer
landscape. It could require several google searches of discussion
forums or downloading PDF manuals to get this information if it exists
or a call to the manufacturer, all that stands in the way between
simply evaluating the item and then deciding it will work and clicking
through the sale. Instead this short-circuit of necessary or missing
information could require dozens of clicks and several searches of
discussion groups looking for answers or clues to what may become a
mystery by default.
Consider then the condition whereby there is lack of basic information
in this entire process, encountered with online retailers and
e-commerce in general, not just Amazon of course. It is assumed when
product data went online, that perhaps nothing new was expected of the
items in the way they were modeled as 'data' in terms of their sale.
Yet for instance this same product was in a store in yesteryear, it
could be touched, evaluated as a 3-dimensional item, and if it
attached to a table the mechanism to do this could be evaluated or a
box could be opened by a worker to help evaluate the device to see if
it actually would fit a particular table or not - prior to sale. And
here is point: the information is available for the person in the
store, though when it is sold online this information may be
non-existent online even though it is a very basic consideration for
its practical and successful use in basic scenarios and everyday
conditions. It is unexceptional to ask such questions in an offline
context, yet when this same questioning occurs in a remote
'catalog-context' or 'online retailer' context often there is no one
to ask or anyone who knows the answer, and it instead is a gamble.
The way this is made to work is by offering free returns, and yet this
also effects other prices and is a structural inefficiency if it could
be solved and such returns unnecessary when they could instead be
avoided, due to an issue such as 'missing information' that is
important to the seller and the buyer, to know enough about the item
at the center of such exchange.
Thus, of various products sold online, consider if they had a more
robust and in-depth data model that consisted of various "dimensions",
and therefore if there were these attachment devices to tables, you
could narrow a search for such items not just by the main category
{tablet attachment}, and instead further by subset details, such as
{clamp to 2-3/4 inches} when others only may only open to 1-1/4 inch
and therefore would not fulfill the criteria.
And so in modeling a particular item or device, as category, it could
be modeled in various subset details that may already occur in areas
like HDTV sets, to some limited extent (a bit too fuzzy whereby false
positives are frequent as with many hierarchical approaches based on,
it is assumed words versus geometric structures based on such
functional details). In some sense it could be equivalent to a limited
'dimensional-search' via matrix, that in some cases may involve
measurement (height-width-depth), color, form or shape, materials, and
other specifics (calories, toxins, requirements). Then instead of
searching from the general to the specific, looking for the needle, a
person could start with the needle, knowing what they usually are
looking for -though cannot find- and located it through geometry of
such data.
In this way, potentially the future of online catalogs in a tablet
interface as it may streamline the process of interaction and exchange
with this data ecosystem of media and other goods.
(concepts: patterns, typologies, variable details, relational structures)
(also, this strategy could be used for other search via structurally
organized -if meta- data as a content or information search via
categories, dimensions, graphs and grid. dimensions, 3- and N-value
logic, set theory, AI interface and interactions. tending toward
'living queries' where, given parameters, search could continue or
map/carto/survey realms, provide reconaissance, report back data
structures, variables. this could be basis for custom data structure
of PC, a model built up over many queries, spanning local-global
structure, heuristic feedback, etc.)

"Modern cryptographic equipment consists of nothing more than a 'black

earlier cipher machines and much of this is still undiscovered. 'New'

i wanted to substantiate an approach to crypto in a larger context
from its parallel within architecture as a discipline that involves
real-time development based on principles that are shared as a
framework and value system, in other words common consciousness about
a given domain or areas of importance or relevance as this effects
what can or cannot develop.
in the existing late 20th c. worldview my research interests into
electrification as critical to understanding the existing built
environment had no place within the history books. such views are
literally erased, censored from books, both as content though also
imagery, there are few 'electrical poles' in those fashion photographs
of buildings, removing the ubiquitous context of infrastructure, as if
they function in a more pure condition than are reliant upon an
external source of power, light, heat, than 'the elements' of nature
and sunlight. because those are the beliefs, shade shadow mass spatial
experience, pre-electric, communication about experience shared in a
context of 'the senses' removed of their electromagnetic truth, such
that ungrounded subjectivism and indoctrination into a world view is
established and _must be followed to succeed in the systematized view
and training to become an architect, within such narrowed parameters.
to continue to extend the existing ideology in this way.
so it was necessary to find justification for such thinking and
consideration, and Plato offers this in terms of conceptualizing the
state as a body, essentially a nervous system. and then considering
this in terms of its governance. how the individual and group are
established via various principles of relation, what is prioritized,
there were also many fragmentary views from Modernist masters relating
to electrical aesthetics, i think it was Walter Gropius who related
the eyeball to the television set, and Le Corbusier had great interest
in the aesthetics of electrification, generators, motors, turbines.
and so an archaeological aspect, yet not integrated into a larger
framework. so as it happens, this continues to a threshold where
scholar-architects Venturi, Scott-Brown, and Izenour share very
insightful observations about the developing electromagnetic
landscape, to include such aesthetics of infrastructure relied upon
(in the desert no less, for life sustaining a/c and casinos and
signage: essentially OASIS and MIRAGE), in their Learning from Las
Vegas and yet the strong and silent type still does not mention or
investigate the electrical order while certainly referencing it and
including it within the chaos of the built environment in the
photographs taken. and yet, in architectural history, there is
supposedly no precedent, no way to make the case that this
infrastructure is an extension of architecture, of fundamental and
foundational relation as an ordering device within the city grid, its
planned development (ala plug-in city, though originating millennia
ago). and yet there is direct lineage with these billboards along the
highway that cars drive by and signage along busy routes near ancient
cities, the present day is an extension of similar structure and order
over a long span of time. it is part of a language, although it may
become subconscious, mediated in other terms or only indirectly, else
could be edited out as 'not architecture' which is the default
what interested me about this, and i am not sure exactly the sequence
my readings occurred, though in deciding to delve into reading a
classic work of literature, the earliest account of architectural
authority (in the West) in terms of its classical culture and
development, if not mistaken, is that it was unlike the existing
conception of what architecture is, and had a far wider boundary for
knowledge and interpretation that today has been narrowed by special
and private interests in a 'training approach' to office workers than
an educational approach that questioned the parameters of
architecture, beyond a confined technical enterprise that overlaps
aesthetics onto a deterministic approach to answered problems of
culture, society, economic development, and political agendas driving
the development, its destructiveness.
Ten Books on Architecture - Vitruvius
so what took me by surprise is that the architect is speaking of not
only geometry and the proportion of temples and buildings at that
time, based on the classical ordering systems...
(Classical Orders: Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, Tuscan, Composite)
...though also about armaments and fortifications, about the quality
of water in wells (wells that produce black bile or something along
these lines), and various other important areas of knowledge in terms
of buildings and development in their larger realm of functioning,
which today would include areas like environment and defense as part
of this architectural inquiry and area of knowledge- for how
architecture exists and functions. In this way, to understand nature
and surrounding culture, infrastructure would fit into this same
approach, and without it the existing dwellings, buildings, the entire
built environment, cities themselves- do not make any sense because
they cease to function without electricity. A skyscraper no longer
functions in this era without electrical elevators and ventilation
systems, lighting, etc. A home would lose its washing machine, food
storage, communications ability, etc. And yet this vital and basic
information is left out of the equation, removed from architecture as
a viewpoint, which is ridiculous, and not allowed in 'reasoning'
within the schools likewise. In this way the ideas of architecture are
shallow, hollowed out of their meaning for a surface-based
interpretation, which serves a particular oil-based development agenda
the reason this was introduced here is because of ancient principles
now absent within the realm of architecture: approximated as
Commidity, Firmness, and Delight... these principles are often
presumed or claimed to exist for the given approach to image-based
development yet have become signage-only, language game seeking to
misrepresent what is going on, as if more is occurring, higher minded
activity than a base activity under the guise of architecture
Commodity, Firmness, and Delight, or Toward a New Architectural Attitude
(for instance, commodity replaced by anti-economy as 'economics';
firmness by using false foundation and understanding for development,
thus developing ungrounded civilization, and 'bliss of ignorance'
delight while this process is being subverted for ulterior motives).
There is misalignment and misrepresentation and short-circuiting and a
sabotaged detour going on within the ancient_tradition of
architecture, whereby today is functions directly against and in
opposition to these principles, most especially in the area they could
be evaluated and-or acknowledged, within the education system which
instead is ruled by an anti-architecture ideology. against thought,
against action, functioning against truth, grounded reasoning itself.
and then one day recently in trying to remember the above tripartite
concept, the mingling of its present incarnation as Fear, Uncertainty,
Doubt appeared in the fog of my mind, though was rendered as: Fear,
Uncertainty, and Delight, instead. and to me this illuminated this
very closely correlated development, removed of its camouflage, suc
that FUD is the equivalent set of principles by which development
occurs in a context of developing of this insecurity, uncertainty, and
incapacitation of people, most notably through ideology of relativism
and binary views based on biased authority structures and control over
reasoning and feedback.
another sample of wreckage from this same broken brain is that of the
Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, the book and also the excellent movie
(c.1949) with Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal.
there is controversy over interpretation of the ideas involved, though
i think an accurate grounding of observation neutralizes the beliefs,
when truth is the arbiter of actions and not just ego, as if belief in
superior vision is justification for higher awareness development that
others just cannot understand and thus lone geniuses stand alone in
obscurity, which then is how the corruption of the star system occurs
with celebrity architecture and development of 'aesthetic buildings'
are removed from larger issues of economics, societal, and their
political reliance and extension of given systems of corrupt power,
instead of questioning these, and thus in some sense 'the cathedrals'
built represent these values, as if glossy advertisements for a
culture devoid of culture, just about shiny objects and immediate
sensory experience that no longer connects with larger surrounding
issues or has a larger impact on lives than in an ecological negative,
like playing music on the titanic as it is sinking,  yet not
accounting for this part of the situation, as if heightened experience
when instead blindness. the entire system supporting this development,
all students, interning as peasants to upkeep offices that churn out
cultural pablum as if 'high conceptualization' when devoid of this, in
truth. then the conceit of the architect in this domain, as if
knowledgeable of what is going on as if in continuance of vitrivuian
awareness, or mastery within the built environment, when basic
reasoning and observation long ago failed in order to support the
ruling oppressive ideology.
so here is the contrast, the other way of considering this: that the
architect who removes themselves from the process of development as an
individual (i.e. human), then revolves around the issue of identity,
awareness, self-conception. issues of governance, models of the state
from individual to group, such that a 'shared identity' (humans) could
be this same individual and may have removed themselves from the
existing treachery, allowed this process of devolution to occur, and
thus the absence of architecture, its truth, then can be made evident,
the lack of culture in those 'representing culture' as stand-ins,
mimics, of a false order and false reality and false perspective
sustained and relied upon for the shallow relations based on another
foundation or set of parameters: say, base materialism, money.
further, 'the architect' may be assumed to thus be one person, one
individual, yet in this way a shared identity can compose this person,
such that the person is human, and as others are also human, they too
are involved in this condition, via shared awareness and values. thus,
a networking of realization or shared state as it were, via whatever
conceptual scaffolding or consciousness is sustained as entablature,
such that wave-collapse does not occur, and the post-and-lintel
connections between here and there are sustained between human beings.
likewise and vitally important, that 'architecture' is a
meta-condition as exampled by ancient conception that ranges beyond
the existing modeling, yet is fragmented and not integrated as a total
discipline in this way. naval architecture is one aspect,
traditionally, though also computer architecture and other areas. the
principles or even code, common structures, and programming (such
that, for instance, music and architecture are closely empirically
related, and essentially everything is, in terms of aesthetics in
terms of its truth and intelligence), then a wider range of activity
may be occuring as 'architecture' than is accounted for, and yet it
may be the truth of its condition, as certain principles are or are
not observed and served. for instance, serving public interest by
having safe water and waste disposal infrastructure versus relying on
toxic systems that despoil the environment, or stewardary of wildlife
and landscape and environments as this relates to weather and
ecosystems or denying these or exploiting them, say with engineering
weather for political manevering and strategy, and to enact certain
development patterns via forced desertification and manipulating
demographic and other flow patterns, as this can become an illegal
basis for creating and sustaining power, off the books, because it is
not included in the observations or analysis, unaccounted for.
further, that any 'architecture' is not at the hand and mind just of
the architect, though in its *implementation*, involving all who are
involved in its development, relying upon a shared awareness and value
system (truth) else subverted in its conception, communication, and
construction, by sabotage or other mistakes, errors, or misalignments
that weaken it. and thus the coherence in the group action to build
something upon a foundation, and how this is achieved, from idea to
its actualization (just like circuitry in technological devices that
then can break in or out of warranty via poor manufacturing or
deceitful practices baked-in).
it is this myth of completely independent action, that the individual
achieves something in its entirely -alone- that is a clean-room
conceptualization of a process that involves many who are part of the
larger process of design, construction, and development, and that this
'functioning together as one' is in some sense 'the architect' in its
larger coherent state, of shared awareness, continuum throughout the
various circuitry that establishes and sustains relations in their
truth, in the shared direction, moving together towards the same
goals. each person having an important role, each part having its own
importance in achieving functioning of the larger integerated whole.
not just as a machine, as a culture, as an idea though further- a
living idea, a living truth that is shared, that governs, principles
that are not merely referred to and referenced as if authority, and
instead, awareness and understanding that is based within and upon
knowing, a way of being or competency that develops in each as a
unique vantage of the common situation, another perspective yet
contributing toward a total perspective, allowing error correction and
greater accuracy than any single viewpoint.
in this way the people who create the materials are part of the
building process, part of the vital development of civilization and
culture, those who construct buildings and systems and develop this
order are vital for its implementation and have feedback and insight
to offer as part of this process, for how given approaches could be
improved or made more economical or with greater strength or
in this way, this coordinated empirical shared effort of many
functioning as one, to include engineers, designers, craftspeople,
tradespeople, workers, manufacturers, technologists, scientists, and
others, including programmers and security developers --- all of these
people are involved in the 'ideas' of architecture, as it is
integrated beyond narrowed boundaries and considered as a larger
conceptual model of how it actually functions, when accounting for its
various and many details and manifestations and dimensions that must
be developed, designed, built, and implemented correctly and
successfully, for the project to have integrity. to be able to endure
over time and function correctly, versus being designed and developed
to fall apart as today via any number of compromises or unshared
goals, lowered principle.
in other words, the potential exists that 'the architect' is in this
larger scale and framework of shared activity amongst many functioning
as one, and that no single person could feasibly be functioning in all
these domains, (unless extraordinary circumstances of all-knowing,
then all truth would be addressed not ignored in the building process,
tending towards utopia).
this is to suggest that 'architecture' could be occurring within a
wide range of realms that are not yet integrated in a larger
conception, conceptualization, or modeling accurately maps to its true
nature and functioning, its inherent interdisciplinary awareness that
integrates into a cohesive understanding spanning these various
domains. and lacking this, the conceit would be that a person could
know more than a tiny fragment of this immensity and alone be able to
shape all of these forces and meld them into a direction as an
individual, because of their truth, instead of having this be an issue
of 'shared identity' of those like who also relate to the situation in
similar dimensions and together can move towards a given direction as
one entity, diverse and multiplicitous yet organized, gaining not
losing coherence- order. and in this way, perhaps a context of entropy
and ideas, likewise, and security issues involved.
(in other words: it is not ungrounded group ego detached from or
ignoring 'truth' that is this shared momentum as development, nor of
an individual that is part of this. such that each pseudo-work is
considered 'the great work' that amounts to mediocrity, if analyzed
further beyond narrowed boundary. instead, of integrity, foundation
common to action, verified and sustained and modeled in its truth, in
service to it, then each point relating to others, lineage from one
structuring to the next, nodes interconnecting within dimensions, this
awareness, then interactions that build upon this stability, this
accurate understanding and modeling, such that it is a common or
shared development, it benefits the whole and the part and each is in
service to the truth of others who are operating within shared
principles, dimensions, and then learning from others, integrating
views, understanding, awareness, evolving a higher capacity and
improving, optimizing functioning, relation, communication, ability to
operate with cohesion yet still error-correct. what are the rules,
logic, truth, reasoning, falsifiability, the ability of debate to lead
to win-win interactions even while in contest because truth benefits
all through its discovery and development, new social dynamics and
understanding and awareness based on this, difficulties faced
betwixt-and-between as the conflict or friction is extreme, working
through the wrong models or moving through the false concepts or
limitations, breaking things down, pain and agony of not knowing or
having limited questioning and then requestioning, losing certainty,
only to regain basic truth and model for any interaction, governance
versus politics, basic versus applied, novice vs. expert, and role of
learning and literacy and basic questions as the place this
functioning occurs, as people move together towards a higher-order or
dimensional integration, over time...)

note: i am not familiar with the indepth reasoning of Rem Koolhaas
related to ~shopping as a cultural activity though to me it cracked a
nut that opens a new universe of analysis about the actual behavior of
people in terms of material culture, social relations, etc. in that it
provides a context for evaluations on par with anthropology and
archeology, of the present situation.

so this is meant to provide context for the following ideas... that
is, there is more to gain from a commercial advertisement in its
cultural depth than just a monetary transaction. (this moves into the
business page of daily newspapers as a tally of ongoing applied
philosophy, where business philosophy is the presiding worldview, the
shared communication that most effects the transformation and
development of culture- as ideas. (moreso: ideology though, as many
sacred beliefs are unquestionable and most things occur in such rigid
frameworks, ungrounded from external variables and falsifications, so
essentially protected views that can be and are weak structurally,
though within a bubble civilization seem peak insight).
beyond scaling of unchecked materialism and profit-based onesided
exchange (of beliefs) there can be lots going on in the development of
material artifacts, processes, as these effect social relations,
activities, various detailing of or within culture, in given sets of
of the basic situation then of commerce, exchange, things that are
conceived of, invented or extended, -made-, developed into systems
small and large, then of the corresponding ideas attached to them,
that move alongside the movement of artifacts as they located in
culture, and find their place. as if shards of pottery someday to be
unearthed in various geographies that then matches a common culture
across distances and differences, via such evidence.

graphic about another music tool that went high concept, into a realm

and then forget, once having known the basic situation....
part of the human nervous system is actually digital and part of it is
analog. and to me this is an important fact about the technological
environment people are living within, especially in terms of sensing
and how coupling with external signals and communications or
exfiltration of biological or physiological information could occur,
if not aspects of remote control over the nervous system via these
same means. and yet as shared view or model of humanity to discuss
ongoing oppressive dynamics in worse-case scenarios- non-existent! not
awareness or understanding except within a field of expertise that is
often politicized, such that there are agendas within professions;
political science -> political medicine -> political neurology and the
next thing you know a drone is flyign overhead and the emg-test you
last had forces a twitch in your arm via EM reflex and you drive off
the cliff. do not need to wait for automated cars to steer you off the
road, it can already happen today, if such systems are 'weaponized'.
what is to prevent such dynamics from existing if they are not
accounted for. and thus this is only one aspect, the danger of not
knowing, yet what may be realized if such a model of the
electromagnetic human was understood or part of the conceptualization
of shared relations, part of the intellectual framework that mediates
the world in a sea of toxic signalling, and what is the limit or
boundary for this happening, (the entire education system for
so a non EM-worldview and non-EM humans existing in electromagnetic
civilization as shared context yet believing the self 'outside' this
perspective for analysis and evaluation, having rationalized and
accounted for activity only in non-EM terms and conceptualization.
sounds like the wrong mathematics of zero again. what is the structure
of the human nervous system, how does this digital and-or analog
circuitry relate to issues of infrastructure, wireless communication,
potential frameworks for consciousness, embodiment, being.
(note: in exploring basic electronics, the category of sensors
fascinated me, especially in regard to common features they share,
such as strain, and their often ~analog nature, as well as a principle
of reversibility in functioning, as if of a deeper symbiotic
connection involved)
(what then does it mean for an all-digital computer in terms of
'processing' or reasoning, versus a hybrid system that matches
functionality of nervous system in its dynamic range)

[excerpt]  II. Philosophers' Distinctions - II.1 Von Neumann
       "The nervous system is based on two types of communications:
those which do not involve arithmetical formalisms, and those which
do, i.e. communications of orders (logical ones) and communications of
numbers (arithmetical ones). The former may be described as language
proper, the latter as mathematics. (von Neumann, 1958, 80)"
Von Neumann's The Computer and the Brain, written in 1956 and
published in 1958, made the analog/digital distinction relevant to
philosophy by claiming that the logics and mathematics of the central
nervous system, viewed as representational systems, must "structurally
be essentially different from those languages to which our common
experience refers" (1958, 82). He has in mind here both natural
language and binary mathematics. [...]

as with crypto basics and possibilities, it is my belief that the
basic breadboard circuit in its actual dynamics has not been fully
accounted for, in that the relation of charge (+/-) including neutral
or  'ground' is not adequately modeled in accurate terms of existence
and instead a structural skew exists that sends everything into a
particular direction. also with crypto that becomes about mathematic
equations and 'beliefs' about signage, than of other dynamics that
exist in the same realm yet whose dimensions may be unrecognized,
ignored, or without value in a given methodology or approach, while
inherently relevant to the core ideas and cryptologic processes. i do
not think or believe the basic circuit has been figured out, that it
remains a question. that the analog digital aspects of the circuit may
be wrongly modeled or conceptualized in the actual terms they exist -
because LOGIC. because of a binary (and yes, thus 'digital' ideology)
approach that favors a certain rationalization as if universal
reasoning when it breaks down at a given threshold or boundary yet
continues on as a 'belief system' in certain assumptions and views
that can be inaccurate or illusory, if not deceptive, false. when the
dynamics between a basic circuit and model of the atom and thus
molecules in which the identical charge relations exist and provide
momentum -do not align or match up- in terms of how they are conceived
and what is going on with grounding (mathematics of zero), such that
"infinity" is made or modeled as if finite, removed from dynamics,
then the potential that is in the realm of N-value is also removed,
made 'digital' as it were even with analog modeling. and it would seem
so too crypto, 'quantum' processing itself seemingly more analog in
the range of parallelism as basis for computation, as a natural
process of equilibrium even, perhaps. and how much of the multi- or
non-linearity of circuitry, its ecological or ecosystem based ~complex
dynamics similar exist in this as a foundational, fundamental context,
firstly, before the digital even develops as a simple on/off switch,
then to represent and model _everything in that reductionist
framework, and claim its signage to represent all that is.
(without accurate logical accounting can such modeling be accurate in
its grounded truth, if this truth is unrecognized or unreferenced
beyond binary biasing and distortion (digital worldview?). how much of
observation is contained or trapped within its warping(etc);)
maybe thinking is not up-to-speed with material interactions, a gap
between models and reality, yet beliefs in accurate representations
that are limiting, based on misconceptions. thus, remove logic
(empirical and error-corrected grounded reasoning) and
electromagnetism, and try conceptualizing computers and crypto in that
context and see what happens. this.
computers are based on _logic, yet a particular kind that is warped
and ideological and is in error as a neutral observational viewpoint.
developing this bias as technological worldview is then enshrining a
false empiricism and vault of the 'digital sky' as consciousness when
it acts and functions against actual consciousness in its ungrounded,
unchecked state, as if 'being' itself. exploitation of this condition
(a kind of magic, sorcercy) tending towards evil as it moves further
and further away from truth and serves and extends the false approach,
what is essentially a shared lie if facts and truth are ignored,
censored, etc. total power, control over a developing system that at
its core is based on error. here, morality, ethics, absence of law
that upholds the false framework as it is institutionalized,
"believed" via leap of faith, ignoring the gap, denying the gap, for
all the material rewards it can yield to its developers. unchecked of
course, forbid from error correction. the representation replacing
reality. the sign becoming truth, that detachment, ungrounded
condition. just like circuit & adam.

1. if prohibition of alcohol = control of speech, as a side-effect,
via behavioral influence, that is, sobriety; what is prohibition of
crypto? control of controversial thoughts and connections, an indirect
form of secondary censorship. Fahrenheit 451 tactics- actual crypto
the fire.
2. if everything is backdoored already, essentially key escrow exists
as the basic situation, instead of having private keys the NSA has a
master key per standard, implementation, other. if this was inside a
known legal framework, that perhaps would be tolerable with oversight,
yet without oversight where tyranny takes over, then everything is
pawned/owned by NSA who could forcibly censor without consequence as
part of a hidden political strategy, etc.
(all tools broken so a crypto scheme can function, leading to all
tools remotely breakable?)
3. question of literature as applied cryptography in
linguistic/typographic model, and also cryptology in decryption
approaches to embedded codes and ciphers, yet perhaps not a strategy
for encryption within ordinary bounded means and measures. are there
in this way two or more distinct approaches, only one that finds
itself in the parameters of computer encryption/decryption as modeled,
and the others reside in a realm of data mining and other statistical
correlations that may function in a realm of cryptanalysis and-or
code-breaking though using different tools and approaches than strong
encryption that currently reigns.
4. is there a unified crypto scheme or is it fragmented and does not
recognize itself in the mirror as its own 'whole' self due to a limit
for this structural-conceptual integration. in this way could
cryptography be schizoid in having two or more parallel systems,
disconnected strategies that function outside boundaries of the other,
and may remain unrecognized. that is, literature/language/linguistics
as crypto versus mathematic encrypt/decrypt schemes, each having their
own ecosystems and boundaries, paths that may never cross or meet
within the given parameters or dimensions as evaluated by the other,
or may exist as unbroken ciphers within other ciphers, encrypted code
within decrypted communications that remains unrecognized due to this
unrelated, ungrounded condition between them.
5. in this way could having 'answers' at the ready (GOTO 2) then
provide confirmational bias that a correct decrypt has been achieved
within a limited view that then becomes foundation for a false
perspective, represented by mathematics. and may a particular
rationalization (GOTO 1) that is enforced as if objectivity defined,
then become the basis for an illusion of mastery or control over
limited dimensionality and observational frameworks, themselves
becoming the basis for an insecure crypto framework (see 1). in other
words, without or banning abberations, then leading to a false
condition of certainty by containing what is or may be uncontainable,
making finite the infinite question and potential parameters into a
'small world'(model); ineffective at best in accounting for actual
crypto, operating.
6. does a hybrid crypto approach exist that remains unrecognized,
whereby both a linguistic even 'literature-based' crypto could exist
alongside mathematical encryption techniques yet remain unrecognized
in the "official" institutional model of cryptography, perhaps even
with a missing cryptological foundation or background, that limits a
realm of computer crypto to a narrow investigation of algorithms and
security inside a bounded, finite domain? (see 3/645)

Keeping the lights on: Mechanical engineer
finds a way to predict cascading power outages
"Each individual component does not know what the collective state of
affairs is," said Mezic. Current methods rely on a steady, abundant
supply, producing enough energy to flow through the grid at all times,
regardless of demand, he explained. However, should part of a grid
already operating at capacity fail—say in times of disaster, attack or
malfunction—widespread blackouts all over the system can occur.
"Everybody shuts down," Mezic said. The big surges of power left
unregulated by the malfunctioning component can either overload and
burn out other parts of the grid, or cause them to shut down to avoid
damage, he explained. The result is a massive power outage and
subsequent economic and physical damage. The Northeast Blackout of
2003 was one such event, affecting several U.S. states and part of
Canada, crippling transportation, communication and industry.

this observation arose from a recent conversation about influence
of alcohol on behavior and mood. where someone who drinks can
say things that they otherwise may not, and in this way a given
viewpoint may have a deeper grounding in the emotions that are
not being accounted for, and could be realized or accessed when
decompressing or reaching equilibrium in another phase or state
of awareness, via inebriation. the role of legal & illegal substances
in relation to edge of insight and cultural development likewise.
thus the aberrant statement or communication that may occur
via this communication is not necessarily less truth, only that
it may not be acknowledged or accounted for in the given view
or modeling. thus, a kind of equilibrium or balancing of forces,
or equalization across parameters known and unknown, those
documented and hidden, via inebriation. for instance, anger if
it arises when drinking and hidden rage. or following ideology
and then when inebriated a person letting down their guard &
speaking their mind, etc. in this way, truth and ideas that may
not fit in the given model. and how this could be an influence
upon culture and conformity if removed and this unwitting or
known feedback does not occur, and a rigid view is upheld
as the cultural standard, instead. where this balancing of
forces may not take place due to its prohibition, even, as
this could advantage those managing skewed modeling
and using it to enforce a given approach, and limit any
alternatives because it does not fit inside the mindset
or belief system, and cannot be questioned beyond this.
in this way, sobriety is equated with a higher knowing or
state of being, potentially, seeing more clearly, when if
in its position it is bounded or limited, these areas of
previous feedback would essentially be outlawed and
not addressed, or set up a schizoid state of relation
by denying other dimensions or relations or dynamics,
as if everything is contained with a rationalization even,
versus breaking-through that boundary into chaos and-
or the unknown, or challenging beliefs about what truth
is and where control originates in the cosmic context.
in that there is a limit to what can be determined via
reductionism, though no limit to the belief of this,
which can stand uncorrected, opposed to truth and
greater evidence than what is allowed or sanctioned.
leading to this...
i understand the different interpretation, and did not
adequately define the analogy, well enough to be make
the correlation clear enough. in the book by Ray Bradbury
it is the truth and ideas in the medium of the book that are
at issue, not just books but their use as a transmission of
beliefs, of alternative (non-sober) principles that challenge
the ruling order that seeks to extinguish this otherness
that is essentially culture itself, knowledge, reality. that
is the basis for control over people and the civilization.
what this extends into further in a cryptography context
is that 'crypto' itself may be outlawed like books, not for
technical means to communicate, but because what is
communicated could be _secret and not controllable by
those who seek total control over what occurs in society.
thus truth, another viewpoint shared by people, especially
if counter to corrupt government, could be this fire held in
the container of crypto, and if it is broken by default and-or
corrupted by design, this other viewpoint could never develop
beyond a given set of parameters because those who think
differently are seen as and believed to be 'the enemy' within
a state that has become rogue and functions against its
own people, in order to forever secure its power over them.
in other words: ideas, truth, shared reasoning is the danger,
and if it cannot be safely exchanged without consequence,
losing your job or career or having ideas disallowed and thus
trading in bad thoughts, as if drunken ramblings even, then
through this prohibition of ideas and thinking, as it relates
to grand inquisitor like auditing of any private domains and
whatever "secrets" people may be sharing, then could be
equivalent to peering into the war plans of the enemy and
all of this could be mapped out into a strategy that seeks
to eliminate this risk of unknowns, to uphold empowered
and extending rationalization within a particular system
of belief that aligns with private politics and corruption,
state of hidden dictatorship, and engineering failure so
to sustain the corrupt works as enterprise planning.
in other words, no crypto, no protected boundary for
freedom of expression or freedom of thought/speech,
communication, or practice of religion even, without
hidden judge, jury, potentially executioner via NSA
and others who are like the monster under the bed,
though inside computers, minds, communications.
where did they get the right to enforce and defend
mediocrity, to pursue and extinguish truth that does
not fit into or is opposed to the ruling political ideology,
and to not have any oversight and be given carte blanche
to pursue a political agenda against citizens, a lawless
agenda that is actively oppressing people in civilization,
and seeks to uphold and enforce an unreal, antihuman
viewpoint that is based on subjugation and exploitation.
i mean if the NSA was going around abusing children
and connected with pedophile networks and seeking
to blacklist and exploit people based on porn habits
or enforcing a no-masturbation rule by "government",
that would be a pretty important insider story, no?
those are the politics also involved in these questions,
the kind of substitute culture that can at once uphold
an unrealistic worldview only to use this for exploitation.
that is what happens in situations of corruption, and in
situations of total corruption, it is institutionalized and
made mainstream yet cannot be communicated about.
so if the crypto is non-existent, so too is such reality.
anyone who starts to think can be persecuted by the
criminals and taken down in isolation, and framed as
if just another sinner via the inside-subversion. that is
how books with another viewpoint can offer perspective
otherwise outlawed, so too working cryptography that
cannot be decrypted. without it, shooting fish in a barrel.
i vote those who work at NSA should be made to wear
helmets and uniforms, and wear big 'key' medallions
around their necks, so we know we are totally owned.
(not sure which way the rubber hose prop should go,
if firehose or perhaps each wearing condom bandoleer)

additional correction/repair of perspective anomalies and errors...
.// further CORRECTION: once again clarification is needed regarding a
previous statement. this is both due to my own limits in
conceptualization and writing and also problems of language, when it
is extremely difficult to encompass all possible cases in a general
view without having contradictions. in my latest errored statement,
the mistaken view is quite large and so must be countered with more
information. i do not have the particular language nor have i
developed the understanding or framework for these dynamics as of yet,
so wrote into a realm or beyond a structure already developed and thus
encountering significant failures in approach. i.e. stating that
'concrete is only a detail' in architecture. the problem is that this
is not true in some situations, and also the word/concept 'detail' is
not the correct word for what i am trying to describe though i am not
sure what a better word would be, feature or substructure or element
or component or structure yet none of these likewise fit either.
though of course there are many who could better state the same ideas
within an improved POV with more accuracy and much more insight and
more knowledge of the issues involved.
so my approach is limited. the language also. and i equate it to is
the following mistaken viewpoint about concrete in architecture, in
special cases:  it is to assume that the sand is only a detail of the
beach. and this is largely false. it _is the beach, or a major or
significant element along with sky and water and wind and waves. it is
a major component, not minor.
and yet in most architecture the concrete involved does not take
center stage, it is another component, so it tends towards a larger
assemblage of components functioning together and is not the main
event. many times concrete is dressed by other facing materials,
skins, that shield it from the weather and provide a different facade
than CMU or precast panels and yet there are also buildings that are
just CMUs and precast walls and-or floors/ceilings. though their
significance in terms of the total building may still remain that of a
quasi-detail or more minor component or insignificant beyond just
being a barrier or boundary, such that the language may not be
explored or developed or insightful and may have inert presence, such
that it is more about 'nothing' than 'being'. say an industrial
warehouse with no windows and a simple door on an exterior that is
otherwise all concrete, with a company logo as sign.
perhaps this is not just a detail though it is also not going beyond
certain dimensionality in its functioning, it is basic and not
necessarily interwoven into other themes beyond utility, such that it
provides structure or boundary, security, enclosure, perhaps texture,
color, scale. it may be unwise to compare it straight away with a CPU
enclosure, as it relates to what is inside the box, though to some
extent this can be a disconnection or simple boundary that is already
defined in its functioning in many ways, by default, unless explored
further. and thus building is often differentiated from architecture
as it does not have this additional layer or level of investigation,
inquiry, innovation, questioning of parameters, function, beyond this.
so in some sense it is a big SIN to not have remembered epic examples
to the contrary where concrete cannot be said to be just another
element or, again wrong-worded, only a detail, as this warps its
contribution and conceptual potential that has been explored (most
notably by Le Corbusier and others). a few examples to provide
Notre Dame du Haut
[images] this chapel by Le Corbusier located in Ronchamp, France, is singularly
in concrete, it defied the existing conceptualization of how the
material could be used and likely still does. it is the determiner of
many architectural dimensions, space, massing, light, enclosure,
walls/ceiling, roof, and if memory serves the massive roof appears to
float when inside, even though made of massive concrete. thus the
gravity of the material has been reverse or inverted. this is the
height of aesthetic mastery, the language of architecture through the
medium of concrete. and more, the use of a ship analogy and metaphor,
its significance in architecture, rendered in concrete as the roof. it
is assumed also medieval fortifications which used to have walls of
several feet thick were related to concrete thickness, when such walls
were once foundation and required to be this thick, which continued
into tall buildings such as skyscrapers when supporting several floors
above them, prior to steel and concrete construction. so perhaps those
(correctly stated) details of windows refer to that earlier language
or pattern. further, there was innovation with formwork such that
textures on the formwork would transfer onto the set concrete forms,
thus revealing wood on its surface, as part of a new technique that
was developed by Le Corbusier. and so this refutes any notion of
concrete only as detail. it is the defining feature across many
dimensions and structures, it almost singularly defines the building
beyond its stained glass and wooden pews. completely captivating in
its essence, and this essence is concrete. and it is a deep
connection, deep awareness, grounding within the material as it is
made into form and functions within a myriad of different parameters.
(also, this built organic form (1954) in relation to sculpture...)
Brancusi sculpture Bird in Space (1930-40) or other
consider then another structure...
Sydney Opera House
it is iconic for its form, resembling billowing sails made of precast
concrete. having visited neither of these structures, it appears
likewise a majority of the building exterior consists of precast
concrete panels. thus another example that 'concrete is not just a
detail', which in these cases is an absurd and ignorant viewpoint,
when universalized. it is the major or prime structural component
though also the basis for conceptualization, the medium that is relied
upon and explored to express or develop such a unique language of
form, based upon the specific and unique properties of concrete in its
various techniques and approaches, many of which are invented by
architects for buildings and have never been built before. thus this
is a realm of large-scale experimentation, the limits of construction,
and daring work even.
it should be noted that recently i encountered a reference to this
building which said how beautiful it was on the outside as a concert
hall, yet the acoustics on the inside are or were horrible, and thus
the building aesthetics and its interior programmatic functionality
were not matched- though this is also why acoustic engineering exists,
which can often optimize a space in such scenarios. the difference
here is that buildings in the past, when having a main function like
'music hall' or 'opera house' were designed around acoustic properties
firstly, if not mistaken. and this is not about chance, how sound
exists in a given space in terms of its size, shape, proportion,
materiality, etc. and thus the outside-in approach, versus inside-out
approach, and how this can conflict perhaps most especially in terms
of the present day where 'image-based' buildings have their external
form as the main development or feature and functionality is presumed
to default to a usable correlated equivalency, yet can also be
hollowed out of meaning, superficial, merely about the surface and not
insightful in other realms or other substructures or components. a bit
like a building that is masquerading, and appears one way yet under
the mask is another way. like fancy aesthetic structures that are
miserable to be inside or just mediocre, yet praised for their looks
or drama, yet less livable or even dysfunctional or needy, requiring
high-maintenance, concessions by its occupants, which is its own type
of lost economy or friction that indicates peculiar approaches,
it is hard to convey how central aesthetics are to knowledge yet when
removed of its role as a grounding of philosophy, of shared belief and
truth, values, knowledge, as materialized, it then can become detached
and move into a realm of relativistic babble, greater accounting does
not take place, and images can be deceiving, illusion or manipulations
of the senses.
another realm of 'concrete is more than detail' it is
conceptualization itself is within the realm of Brutalism, a
particular movement or style in architecture...
Brutalist architecture
as should be obvious, my observations are only limited and there are
people with vast understanding who have researched these issues and
who have expertise, though some of this also is intuitive, from living
in civilization and environments where such buildings exist and define
a space, within given parameters. and I have a fondness for a local
example, at least in its appearance, which tends towards fortification
though has also been evaluated as a response to student unrest on
college campuses, an embodiment of the fortification of the
educational system against students and populations, visible in
aesthetics of built form.
Boston City Hall
so in the history books i read that defined a particular shared
consciosuness, this building is one of the main examples. and it is
implicitly 'concrete' in more than detail, it is seemingly in its
conceptual entirety, in that it melds what is material also with the
mental awareness of concrete as metaphor or analogy, as if anchoring
something into the ground, making an idea it into a tangible truth,
via securing of spatial-order vis a vis security or fortress, or
whatever. in that an underlying realm of hostility and unrest or a
different mapping of experience may better be realized or understood
in these more stark forms and encounters, as if the realm of
ubiquitous surveillence maps more readily into these aesthetics even,
then those buildings of high gloss, shiny distracting objects. in
other words, you could probably use this building for military
purposes even, or some such structures, because of their more
fortified nature than all-glass facades, and a more primal or
primitive relation could be established, more natural perhaps with the
social Darwinist/Spencerian survival of the fittest dynamics, if not
even towards a Planet of the Apes retro-futurism of some kind. again,
concrete here is more than the material, it is a larger connected
essence and its language is developed in depth.
Rarig Center for performing arts at U of Minnesota (local example)
so there is a difference in how a medium develops, in what terms and
parameters, what ideas are explored and what conceptualization is
involved. it can be contained, and thus a material could exist only as
a detail in some or many circumstances, yet in others it could become
a major or main event and take on a primary role, and become a realm
of peak inquiry and innovation. this both in terms of language and
geometry/mathematics, of structures and aesthetics, as it relates to
concepts, patterns. or it could be unquestioned and an issue of
utility, relied upon to do once again what has been provably done
before within given parameters. yet to describe all of this dynamic
range within linear strings is impossible and arbitrary, because it is
far more involved, and requires clarification for each and every error
or misconception and thus words words words to seek to repair faulty
frameworks and reasoning that is limited, bounded, to particular
constraints or points of views, etc. and thus this condition of
language could itself be the gap or mismatch with the issues of
existence, the impossibility of accurately relating to what is going
on in its ubiquity and depth within the parameters it exists within,
without being trapped in warped, distorted, and biased if not untrue
or only partially-true statements that then function as communication,
there appears no way to fix this within linear language itself. this
as it relates to code and to programming likewise. it is a trap, ideas
and concepts cannot be empirically developed within words to a degree
of fidelity required to attain 1:1 conceptual models. thus, also,
software ever disconnected from what it seeks to represent in these
same scenarios.
it is the artificial and misleading, false 'nature of things', this
language-based communication about events and seeking to model events
within signs that are linearly described, looped, versus within
molecular dimensional structures - circuits - that can actually
account for all components, elements, details and events in whatever
degree and fidelity they may exist.
one stray example arises repeatedly in my mind about the nature of
architecture as it has become detached from a larger accounting and as
this relates to core principles. it used to be a goal to have a
structure last, to endure over time, as part of the goal. today
instead planned obsolence has taken hold so buildings may stand for
only 30 years before being demolished. consider this in terms of how
it influences design, what issues are addressed and ignored, and how
much material is wasted to continue such an inefficent process that
also stands-in for development as an engine, process, or flow of
activity that circulates money around. in that it is a circuit, how
this functions.
no doubt there is aesthetic beauty in many buildings though what it
often hides is that other issues are being ignored (such as
environment, planning, social relations) and architecture can just be
about the image. perhaps like those apps that can be easily created by
putting various parts together, throwing an interface on a given
structure, yet that is not innovating beyond a particular level of
inquiry or set of relations, which then become bounded, limiting.
the following observation is not to question the legitimacy of
approach for the building in its functioning, which is built like
others by star architects all around the globe. so it is not to single
it out as an example, though it provides a case in point regarding
certain values that are taught of in school that in practice are
seemingly no longer of significant importance...
consider the birds nest stadium built for the 2008 Summer Olympics...
Beijing National Stadium
while of great beauty, there is also great dismay at the material
design involved due to issues of economy. in school they teach you of
surface area, how this relates to heating and cooling of a structure,
and how each and every joint or connection is a potential weakness,
whether for water or rust or expansion/contraction failures from
stress and strain, including between different or particular
materials. how a building is put together and funcdtions over time.
that this is part of its success or failure.
and my immediate thought or reaction really upon seeing this 'visual
structure' was the known extreme maintenance it would require over
time, in having to maintain/upkeep the 'visual structure' via
presumably paint and-or rust protection, for each angled connection
and joint and surface. perhaps it will not rust, perhaps it requires
no painting. yet if it does it is certainly non-trivial as to the way
the building functions over time. unless like most stadiums these
days, it is destroyed after 30 years time.
(in some way the detachment from larger considerations allows this
narrow 'design development' to take place in architecture, it is in
some significant way a form of luxury, yet detached from
responsibility, afforded by ignoring other vital aspects, decadent or
based in excess, disregard for economy beyond economics, as if
architecture is financialization writ large even. the embodiment of a
business philosophy detached from the surface of the earth in its
actual truthful accounting and functioning instead within parameters
of a fairy tale that is never spoken against, to sustain the illusion
or delusion that aesthetics can be primary without also securing their
foundation, connecting it with deeper truth. instead it can be
shallow, hollow, or unsteady, and may not withstand the momentums of
culture as it continues to advance or stall out over time. there is
something of a treachery involved in 'image-analysis' that lacks a
larger framework for its evaluation, and yet this has become the
guiding 'philosophy' of architecture likewise, to which students must
kneel down before such ideas as if of superior nature and awareness
versus cutting corners and in effect, cheating the discipline of its
integrity and substituting it with a lesser set of goals and ideals
that tend towards the profane instead.)
in some ways it seems that code can be like this also. that there can
be structures that are difficult to maintain or upkeep yet are
developed in a way that there is no way to sustain them over time.
tens of millions of lines of code say, that cannot simply be renovated
or simply tweaked or fixed up. it appears almost as if a prevailing
ethos of development both online and offline, in software, hardware,
and material development, processes and procedures as this maps to
business, social relations, and how knowledge exists and moves into a
particular direction, as if a kind of momentum or flow within a given
circuit whose parameters best or most optimally function in this way,
yet may not add up to more over time, and more require a limited or
bounded relation or condition for their existence. in that this
interaction or limited engagement is the nature of the material so
conceived, considered and that another system or material approach may
be required to develop other options that are not preconceived or
pre-wired into the existing approaches and "economical" methods that
can lack the foundation needed to develop cohension in other areas,
shared realms of inquiry, larger modeling or conceptualization beyond
the finite, separate, iconic isolation that becomes based and reliant
upon principles that may function against larger, longer goals, simply
by using existing approaches that have ideological functioning

@_subject: patterns & tracks (urls) 
comment: so here in the Great White North, one year all of the sudden
many people on local television were complaining about the fact that
there is snow in Minnesota. i had never heard anyone in my life
complain about snow in Minnesota, as if it was a negative event. who
are these people? when did the population get replaced? - and it
seemed that another kind of person now existed in the area who was
fundamentally not from here else did not belong, and hopefully finds a
place they like better. rather than stand in snow complaining about
so take an event X that has certain functioning and variables, that
could even be its nature, what makes it what it is (X).  thus, X=snow.
and then consider a place (MN) as being invariably tied to this
condition, such that MN=X within a certain range of parameters, say
and for many, as long as they have shelter, warm clothes and boots, it
can be an enjoyable time. if not, you may not survive. though snow and
winter have profound aesthetic value as a transformation from what is
known into another realization and understanding of the same place,
within differing parameters (light, color, temperature, clothing,
transportation, etc). so living in the north can be an education in
itself, knowing about winter, learning from it.
the larger situation is repeated elsewhere. in particular, in
educational contexts that have also migrated online as a type of
disapproval of certain natural functioning and awareness. most
notably, discussion groups online where a given [topic] will then have
limits placed upon its exploration, even though inquiries may fall
squarely within a given domain. and to this my response is similar:
who are these people, where did they come from?
for instance, the basic principles of [disciplines] such as
architecture can be censored in discussion or other areas (cultural,
technological) because it falls outside the artificial lines or
boundaries so conceived by a given ~managing population. such that
'the ideas' cannot be discussed, in their natural habitat, which
instead relies upon a definition of a place such that: place=not-X. or
in other words: topic = not-topic. insofar as it challenges a given
ideological boundary. and this can be as unnatural as believing 'snow
is bad' in Minnesota- fundamentally unnatural as a viewpoint. yet so
too, 'architecture is bad' for architecture, and onward. 'security is
bad for security' etc.
and perhaps this is evident in boundaries that are upheld and
constructed, maintained, such that certain issues and ideas cannot be
discussed due to enforcement of limits, and these may not have
anything to do with secrecy via NDA and instead, of wrong ideas and
thinking that challenge the status quo interpretation and belief
system (religion as state, essentially), yet that substitutes a
condition of truth with another, a pseudo-version that is fake, unreal
by comparison, and yet upheld as the basis for relation and exchange.
in that, having a negative view of snow in Minnesota, at least for me
and those i have known, is going against what makes this place what it
is, in its depth and connection with the area. and viewing 'ideas' as
negative that have this connection with a given topic or
understanding, likewise, unnatural and out-of-place. indicative of
other dissonance, ungrounded relations. to forbid 'ideas' of crypto
within discussion of cryptography, poo-pooing it, for instance, would
be an interesting realm to consider for how deep this disconnection
could go, thus revealing a surface relation or deception reliant upon
the not-X condition to sustain itself, or in this case, the need for
insecurity, obscurity, unknowing, disconnection, as vital to the ruse.
all such betrayels of truth reveal themselves in how truth is related
to, observed or ignored.
consider in this context, then, how might the government ever combat
issues of 'cyberspace' if its relation with electromagnetism was never
allowed to be established; such that:
     cyberspace = not-EM
on NSA interview on 60 minutes: it was stated that the interconnection
between various computer analysis systems (metadata) was needed to get
the 'whole picture', in that it is necessary to engage the situation
at the scale it exists. without this, conceptual blindness due to
limits or boundaries that prevent greater understanding of how things
now consider an entire university system, education system down to
gradeschool, that is forbidden from uniting its metadata beyond
compartmented views. that is essentially the condition today that
enforces illiteracy and makes it impossible to reason about advanced
situations beyond finite language games:
      culture = not-EM
everything that is connected via electromagnetism, and
interdisciplinary via shared structure and order of truth, is denied
by its lack of inclusion, allowance, and validation by authority - and
get this: on the basis for superior (private) belief based upon what
amounts to religious opinion, that instead censors truth so that this
wider viewpoint cannot be established. leave it up to some girls in
gradeschool to challenge the paradigm on a science project, the very
situation that cannot be addressed through reason otherwise, due to
issues of power.
the NSA gets its integrated metadata. the citizens and education
system does not. this is to include EMF hazards and electropollution
in relation to telecoms and telephony, etc. what about metadata of

and city that someday should become general knowledge because
there is a lot to learn about technology, social relations, culture
through greater understanding of the daily inhabited environment;
(the book Electrifying America by David E. Nye is one such account)
for instance, you could take any appliance or artifact and map it out,
back to previous dynamics, say a ice box compared to e-refrigerator,
or iron heated on fire to electric iron, its relation to laundry room of
washing machine and dryer. how these effected social roles, etc.
e.g. electrical desk light, radio, computer, home alarm systems.

say alarm system with external security monitoring and police. the

it should also be mentioned that this type of 'feedback' is potentially
possible and valuable in any work or routine process, where it could
function in more or less efficient or effective ways. and this can be
connected to individual lives or managerial issues within companies
that either allow for such local perspective or seek a top-down model
where the viewpoint and ideas only originate from a given vantage,
and this could distinguish an intelligent and adaptive organization
from a rigid approach that is stuck in time and ultimately overtaken
by others innovation- thus relation of processes and functioning
with business philosophy, application of principles, their mediation
that can have economic, social, political effects, un-shared beliefs, &c.
(for instance, a worker in a production process has insight into how it
is and is not effective and can offer feedback for tweaks, improvement
or not allowing this and having that inefficiency/ineffectiveness built-in
and then normalized, including as relational ideology, that can limit the
engagement with the situation or force disengagement, detachment.
in other word, testable hypotheses of flow and routine functioning or
are these unquestioned and enforced to uphold given social relation)
likewise, what may appear only commonsense today - having enough
room to maneuver in the kitchen and use appliances effectively - can
extend as a conceptual question into the present and future day, such
as how the pantry, kitchen, and e-commerce in an automated scenario.
this was part of the idea for the Asperger Management System (AMS),
whereby a home computer system (data furnace) would use A.I. to bid
on restocking pantry, perhaps even in a financial market sense, where
'group bids' for a local community could exist to purchase wholesale,
and so an exchange could develop and suppliers to fill the contracts.
this would then integrate the 'intelligent refrigerator' with pantry,
and then have an A.I. data furnace device manage routine orders,
based on patterns that could include weather, past price history.
and of course a dwelling would need a way to store/allow packages
when people are away from home, to allow deliveries at any time.
note here the vital role of both encryption and security protocols.
(this leading to how existing courier/shipping services function, in
that people can wait all day for an e-commerce shipment to arrive
when instead an e-commerce portal or secure drop box could exist,
and before that, wireless updates when a driver is on their way to
a destination, providing a 30 minute window or lead-time vs. 8 hrs

so i have been researching PVDF piezo film sensors
via a technical manual [0] and there is a lot here that
may be of potential interest in terms of its applications,
[1] especially its use in security systems and to prevent
tampering, and energy harvesting, in addition to other
areas where its unique functionality could be explored.
what follows, a series of short posts about this material...
0a. Measurement Specialties PVDF technical manual (PDF)
0b. technical manual with Appendix of piezo film articles
1. Measurement Specialties Piezo Film Product Guide
so PVDF is 'piezo film' that has unique properties and
capabilities. while i know little of functional electronics,
it is said to be a capacitor that stores and discharges
high voltage energy. like a piezo disk it picks up the
vibrational energy due to structural deformation that
then generates or moves charge in response to this.
the application i recently first encountered it was with
'contact microphones' - where it was stated that these
PVDF film tab mics record the vibrations as sound input
rather than acoustic pressure of condenser and dynamic
capsule microphones reliant on soundwaves moving the air.
so the distinction is that this piezo film can function as
a recording input or SENSOR though by registering the
vibrations on the surface of a material. what is more, it
also detects temperature differences and thus can be
employed as a sensor this way as well, which i did not
realize was possible nor expect for a 'microphone'.
the PVDF film apparently is already used in security
applications within computers, if not crypto systems
protected from tampering, via vibration sensing that
triggers lock down or equipment destruction based
upon monitoring of piezo film signals at perimeter.

(interesting likewise is use of piezo coaxial cable for
perimeter security, strung on fencing as a microphone
and also buried underground, which then can register &
record raindrops, footsteps, people climbing fence, etc.)

okay, so the big surprise for me was that this piezo film
technology lines up directly with an energy harvesting
article from a recent (urls) list. excerpted again below:

@_author: brian carroll 
@_subject: PVDF as antenna - (03) 
from this vantage of not-knowing, and having experimented
some with breadboards and the Parallax Basic Stamp
microcontroller platform, it would again seem possible
that if the PVDF were conceptualized as an antenna that
when it is geometrically aligned does not just access a
realm of signals, and instead, this signal is itself energy
that correlates directly with a capturing of voltage within
the piezo film as capacitor, such that an 'energy antenna'
exists and perhaps this is the basis of energy harvesting,
though seemingly is bounded by how it is implemented.
in that its application appears to be requiring mechanical
energy, affixed to a surface which bends the material as
the basis for vibration, than tuning into a frequency that
is detached from the sensor and yet resonates it via the
correspondence and alignment of shared tuning (A=A),
and in this way motivates charge within a larger circuit.
so there are whitepapers that exist about self-sustaining
circuits based on PVDF and microcontrollers [0] and yet
nothing in this other realm about the 'global AC circuit' [1]
as this could also influence movement of the antenna in a
framework beyond that of sidewalks and HVAC vibrations.
in that atmospheric electricity and the earth-ionosphere
cavity [2] have fundamental relation to EM technologies
thus, stating the obvious in an expanded view beyond
that of a compartmentalized realm, this condition of being
within such an environment, yet not having it understood
or conceptualized based upon a false limit or no-go zone,
as if fringe to consider or perhaps not obvious to those
without instruction, the educational system enforcing a
fundamental disconnection, as if to keep everything that
is naturally connected apart, as if somehow beyond limits
thus basic electromagnetic awareness, to then read the
technical manual [3] where it states the following:
"Although the forces involved are small, the film can be used to
excite other mechanical structures over a very wide frequency range.
If a second element of film is used to receive the induced vibration,
the system can possess a very high dynamic range, even though the
overall "insertion loss" due to the film is about -66 dB typically for
a structure at resonance. If sufficient gain is applied between these
elements, the structure will self-oscillate at its natural frequency.
For these resonant mechanical systems, high voltage drive is not
required. The amplifier circuit may function adequately from a normal
dual rail op-amp supply, or even from a single 9 volt battery. For
analysis purposes, even lower applied voltages, e.g., the noise source
of a spectrum analyzer at 70 mVrms, are sufficient to insert the
mechanical energy into a structure when piezo film is also used to
monitor the result." (p.5)
now consider again the issue of tuning and shared resonance,
that the movement of one object at a certain vibration/frequency
could induce another object to also vibrate at that frequency if
the resonance was shared or tuned similarly.
thus, a PVDF film 'transmitting antenna' could seemingly generate
a vibration at a given frequency, and if matched to anther PVDF film
as receiving antenna, could induce it to vibrate and in effect, transfer
or transmit the power from one circuit into another, via this vibration.
i.e. resonance-based transfer of energy, or remote power generation
so you could place a microcontroller antenna tuned to a frequency
a few feet from another, on a separate circuit, and seemingly then
light up its LEDs via vibrational energy, no electromagnetism that
spans this gap, and instead resonance or vibration as the medium.
(note: non-acoustic seemingly because it is the material itself that
is vibrating and not "acoustic" air pressure pushing it to vibrate.)
note: in this way it is clean, non-pollutive, and nonradiating energy
and this is what Tesla had discovered apparently, and yet it was not
able to be developed further, given the all-encompassing situation.
and yet, listening to the stories of hh, she conveys that Tesla who
had developed alternating current infrastructure thought in retrospect
that it was unnatural and harmful as an energy approach, and that
this resonance-based energy was based upon natural cosmic order,
and was correctly aligned with life and nature, not functioning against
it via invisible toxic pollution of radiation and its massive inefficiencies.
so now there are two major themes: one is energy capture via the
Schumann Resonance, and another is non-electromagnetic transfer
of power via antennas tuned to a shared frequency, whereby current
from one circuit could induce it in another. this is different from the
magnetic induction whereby magnetic fields bridge the gap between
transmitter and receiving device, and any electric or electromagnetic
version likewise, whereby current is bridging this gap, ionizing the
air inbetween, breaking down the structure of the air to move energy,
versus nontoxic vibrating at some imperceptible infrastructural layer
that is already active within nature, which all entities are attuned to
as part of a living ecosystem and circuit, yet also out of harmony and
out of balance via technology and development in the present moment,
with populations unable to grasp the hostile situation we exist within,
environmentally, ecologically, educationally, intellectually, realistically
in the dimensions & parameters that exist, for optimal decision-making
what then if the approach or conceptualization is off, and equipment
and tools exist for experimentation like early days of electrification,
where hobbyists can turn inventors and transform the situation by
exploring beyond the edge already defined, via new interpretations
or accessing old, discarded ideas and knowledge, thinking it through
once again, and perhaps massive discoveries await via such experiment

@_subject: tuning piezo antenna - (4) 
basically at this juncture there are questions of piezo film itself,
and then how to control this within a circuit, which could also
involve information transfer, and thus microcontroller platforms
are probably involved in such experimentation and development.
so how i approach this situation is that i look at what is available
for piezo film sensors, and contemplate how that plastic-coated
piezo film could be made to vibrate automatically or function as
a non-radiating transceiver of 'resonance-based' energy as signal.
and thus the options are basically for little rectangle tabs of film
that plug into a breadboard circuit of a microcontroller or else can
be soldered to a circuitboard, as with various other approaches. [0]
e.g. the DT Series from Measurement Specialties is the same type
of strain-gage sensor found in contact microphones. [1] though i was
still completely puzzled by another version of this element that has
a round metal opening in its otherwise flat surface as if a mistake
occurred at the hardware store. as if a pierced PVDF sensor. [2]
and then after a google search i happened upon a experimenter
who built an Arduino Seismic Activity Monitor [3] using the same
PVDF element and it was then realized the hole in the piezo tab
related to its use as a cantilever that vibrates and that additional
weights can be added to limit what frequencies influence it, thus
the antenna can be tuned to respond to only certain frequencies,
or in the larger consideration, potentially to resonate in a narrow
window where it could be specifically tuned to, say- 7.83 Hz, if
indeed it either could be manufactured this way as an antenna
or retrofitted via weights or modifications. or so it seems possible.
in other words, having once had access to a seismic sensor, the
range in which the vibrations would trigger the circuit could be
fine-tuned to a certain limited parameter which could potentially
influence inefficiency or limit any outside involvement, harmonics
from powerlines or ambient noise that could lessen or disrupt the
clean or predominant movement, seemingly. like only having one
vibration versus several that counteract and diminish one another,
though perhaps in some cases harmonics could be beneficial and
in others counteract the movement. those who know would know.
(sidenote: interesting to consider precisely because such a sensor
can still be used as a microphone element and could be tuned or
adjusted to pick up stray signals or vibrations from the environment,
say the 60 cycle hum of alternating current, more on this later..)
so, tuning of the adjustable PVDF film tab apparently involves
either guesswork or use of an oscilloscope, which i wish i knew
how to use because it seems the conceptual foundation of the
diagnostics of electronics and circuits, how to relate to and
understand them in detail and without it, the multimeter in its
non-graphic approach remains to me an issue of numbers only,
never having understood how all of it fits together as a worldview.
though it is evident that it is possible to put weights onto this
cantilever of the sensor and then measure it so that it only can
vibrate within a certain wavelength, or frequency, in this case it
was bounded for earthquake sensing, to a lower range and thus
filtering out all the higher frequencies that could influence if not
trigger the sensor, said to be extremely sensitive to vibrations,
otherwise. what this amounts to is: if you know electronics and
know circuits and have an oscilloscope, you could probably tune
the antenna to a particular frequency range, whether to transmit
or receive crypto data as infrasound (seems unlikely as transmit,
though receive apparently a-ok, if material connection is vibration,
again not acoustic or in air; thus computer chassis, cables, etc)
or at ultrahigh frequencies (transmit/receive seemingly both ok.)
thus perhaps someone with the know-how to see if it is actually
possible to transmit data via resonance-based vibration, where
movement is induced in another circuit, becoming power for that
circuit, else also transmit data via non-electromagnetic means,
on the principle of shared tuning. (there is more to this, opening
up and tapping into the infinity of a circuit, and somehow having
this drive the vibration of the PVDF ((which is more 'the aether'
from what i understand, not of this dimensionality)) though that
is for some other investigation, in some other time and place.
this involves challenging existing mathematics of zero, etc.)
in any case, the point here is that there could be multiple ways
of tuning the piezo film as an antenna within these parameters,
and it could involve differing approaches or circuits to do so.

@_subject: PVDF & microcontrollers - (5) 
it is already established my skills do not allow exploration of
these issues though i have some basic observations to share
about what exists based on web searches that may quicken
research for those interested who are new to PVDF sensors.
first observation is that a development kit exists for those who
have knowledge and interest and want to start experimenting,
[0] though it does not appear to include cantilever hole designs
of the sensor, that was mentioned in terms of tuning antennas.
still, it could be useful for exfiltrating data or capturing signals
sent via infra- or ultrasound, and also has a large film element
that has been used as a speaker in various online demos. for
instance, seemingly you could wire up a PVDF sensor along-
side computer chassis and monitor signals via its vibrations,
or powersupply, perhaps keyboard or keystrokes or whatnot.
likewise, power various tools via energy harvesting of these
same approaches else discover free-energy approach based
in shared resonance not coupled to another material beyond
the antenna itself if tuned to a primary and matched source.
it seems Arduino and other microcontroller platforms are for
those already saavy in programming and they and other such
programmable integrated circuit platforms represent a large
population of developers, professionals, experimenters, and
hobbyists, and other enthusiasts. this seems equivalent in
kind to the early era of electronics with crystal radio kits
occurring in an engineering centric culture that grew into
the early computer industry via ham radio experimenters,
and those who mail ordered and constructed electronic kits,
today involving the internet, online stores, discussion boards
in the realm of advanced computing, everyone having their
own programmable 'computer-based' development platform,
and a tremendous kit of parts to choose from, to further explore.
including ideas, goals, projects, hypotheses, prototypes, etc.
the reason for stating this is that a certain level of literacy may
exist for many who are computer literate in the advanced sense
of a cypherpunks context, knowing hardware and software and
ideas beyond this, into mathematics and linguistic concepts,
and so a high-fidelity understanding and awareness may exist
that enables greater ease of use within the ready-to-program
devices that have limited documentation, and can present a
large learning curve for those starting without such experience.
thus, straight-away to mention that Sparkfun [1] carries various
PVDF sensors, example, that can then be added into whatever
microcontroller may exist capable of interfacing with the sensor.
the thing is, in researching this, it appears there is potentially
limited data for people just starting out, for how to go about this,
whereas those already fluent may know how to put it all together.
apparently instructions can be lacking and this is mentioned with
respect to another approach for those like myself who need more
step-by-step instructions and learning tutorials to know what to
do and how to think about things, to build up awareness via
making circuits on the microcontroller versus using it for an
already determined objective. and there are general kits to do
this for Arduino, in particular a 37 module sensor kit [2], so it
is potentially an experimenter's paradise, if knowing how to get
everything functioning, having a plan and enough information.
i do not know enough about Arduino to know other competitors
in the same domain though it appears there are many others
(Beagleboard, etc) so that was used just as an example of
several different options that exist where these piezo sensors
can be integrated into the existing programmable platform,
to custom-build and craft circuits, as is already being done.
(note: if i am using 'platform' in the wrong way, my apologies,
it is the nearest word i know of to describe these tools)
so essentially it is a 'nothing new here' situation for those who
know all about this technology, though potentially to question
the potential for a piezo film sensor beyond existing boundaries
and perhaps for advanced unmentioned cryptologic applications.
the issue then is to question an electronic component, this
piezo film tab as vibrational cantilever, the piezo element that
exists beyond the circular disk and functions in other territory
and in other configurations, including also piezo coaxial cable
(and again, its potential use as an antenna of other dynamics)
and so, for instance, the datasheets are included on some of
the urls below, to provide more information if interested in
evaluating if the given parameters may allow experimentation
within the realms considered, say detecting signals patterns
via vibrational 'contact' versus acoustic microphone. [3]
so that is perhaps the majority approach for those already
up to speed, though everyone may not have the same approach
or others may want to learn about this, and thus a programmable
microcontroller platform I have successfully learned from before,
both about electronics and software programming of breadboard
circuits is the Parallax BASIC Stamp Activity Kit [4]. essentially
it is a platform for educating people about microcontrollers and
provides an indepth tutorial and various circuits as part of a kit,
and support forums for experimenters and developers, as with
Arduino, which may have its own 'learn electronics' kit, though
it seems Parallax has focused on this educational sector and
providing materials for schoolchildren, hobbyists, and up, to the
professional sector prototyping and development solutions, so
is perhaps unique in its tutorial or hands-on learning approach
versus what may require additional instruction else a different
more self-guided approach otherwise, with other pathways.
(trying to be fair, not advertise, yet also provide information
about the offerings. also: if other PVDF vendors, they are few
or do not have information i could locate in repeated searches)
this is why I mention the Parallax kit that includes a fundamental
course in learning circuits via a programmable breadboard. this
same PVDF sensor [5] can be used with this platform, and it
also has additional data on the commands related to it as part
of a User Guide for that specific tutorial approach, [6] in that it
may provide more structure than other less structured approaches
though perhaps this is more related to the overall framework of
learning to use a microcontroller itself, where for some a more
all encompassing approach may be required prior to interfacing
with the PVDF in terms of programming functioning of a circuit.
and likewise, following this same general theme, the Sensors
Sampler Pack for the Parallax BASIC Stamp microcontroller
includes a PVDF element along with other sensor options. [7]
the reason for providing examples is to see what is out there
for those learning, in individual components and then within an
integrated approach, of which there are various routes to take.
for instance, consider the following project:
Phoenix Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor Project
Sub-project: Piezo Film Pulse Sensor
if someone already knows what they are doing, competent in
the domains of hardware and microcontroller programming, it
would probably be fairly likely they could replicate or learn from
this demonstration of use for a PVDF sensor. yet further, someone
with an interest in cryptography or crytanalysis, could potentially
take this same information and apply the pulse reading to the
chassis of a computer to monitor vibrational activity or apply
this same information in some other way, in terms of security
analysis, exploits, defense, research, exploration, experiment.
though someone who does not have this knowledge then may
be stuck, unless a step-by-step approach exists, which is more
the Parallax approach, and perhaps in some ways Arduinio if
online tutorials exist in place of paper manuals, though these
extra layers of information may be required prior to achieving
such finished projects, and needs to be built-up as a skill first.
but not everything that is involved in this situation is about
technology of computer hardware and software, and the code
can go beyond computing, even 'electrons' potentially, in terms
of what the situation could be modeled as, via its parameters.
in that the PVDF as tunable antenna is not unlike a tuning fork
that is made to resonate by another paired vibration, and while
it may appear this is acoustic energy, air pressure, it could be
the resonance of the material itself that is set to vibrate due to
its physics, its particular construction and composition. that is,
as with Helen Hall and her study of music physics, that what
this involves relates to the issue of a vibrating string, and the
'energy' issues of vibration can be conceptualized likewise in
terms of music principles, such that the resonance as it now
is conceived of may not exist within computing in the way it
is known in music, for instance, yet it may have importance
in terms of harvesting energy via non-acoustic vibrations.
i do not myself understand what this involves enough to better
introduce to topic, though to hh it is 'the Art of Frequencies',
as this relates to music physics and music and energy. the
reason it is mentioned is that sympathetic vibrations occur
in a paired matching or alignment (1:1) and (A=A) in terms
of logic, within my own research, and in this way especially
in terms of 'consciousness', each person their own antenna,
and how they relate to others and in what ways. a common
example could be sexual dynamics and 'magnetic fields', in
that a certain pressure or boundary may be encountered via
anther that either attracts or repels or is perhaps neutral. in
this framework, there is something tied into the materiality
of encounter, the physical body and its relation to another,
other as self or unlike self, as this constitutes circuitry.
further, though, beyond or outside a realm of push & pull
of both magnetic and electromagnetic polarity, it also can
potentially include something 'outside' this EM boundary,
in that a non-electromagnetic energy of vibration could
also exist -- as if in the realm of information itself -- that
maps onto these same connections as 'shared tuning'
(all mention of tuning has origin with HH, in my work).
so what this is to suggest is that this inductive sensing
of humans, this mapping of awareness of self and others,
could be occurring as information in this vibrational way,
if connecting 'dots' across various views and approaches,
and thus how people are tuned or out of tune may relate
to what signals they pick up or what movements they are
part of, as grounded within certain dimensions, dynamics,
self as circuit, then relation with others into groups, etc.
and this is also the PVDF antenna model, seemingly.
potentially. the only substitution i would suggest is that
that 'global electrical current' that could set everything into
a shared time and framework of connected circuitry, would
be in some sense an analogy of empirical truth that flows
into the shared macrocircuit and people are aligned by it.
thus, induction beyond electromagnetism, though also
as a pressure, perhaps, the pneumatic aspect, and the
larger cosmological question of 'strings' that may be of
an informational category, in terms of cosmic vibration
that is defined by resonance of each and every object,
if not mistaken in relaying others knowledge involved.
in other words, consciousness could be modeled by
this circuit in terms of information transfer as it also
could have an energetic component yet this approach
could exist outside or beyond the current conception
of the body in both nonexistent electromagnetic terms
and also, non-existence non-electromagnetic terms
functioning outside this electromagnetic framework,
in the sense that aetheric order could exist beneath
the existing dimensional space, this described as a
vortex model of the atom, as it relates to zero. [8]
so the potential, should a vibration on an antenna
transform into harnessing free energy - via resonance
and this new PVDF film sensor technology - then its
significance is also conceptual, beyond perhaps the
issues of creating a vibrating cantilever or pendulum
in a watch that removes the need for a battery or for
winding, due to being tuned to frequency of the earth
that becomes part of its circuit, its power source, via
this connectivity based upon natural order, its circuit
as ecosystem and habitat, context for technology.
and how this moves into modeling of self as a being,
an entity, modeling of information in relation to energy
and matter, in terms of music and physics principles,
and how it recontextualizes questions and parameters
were it to be unlocked as a common framework within
which people relate or decide to disallow its existence
i only saw the first two parts of Atlas Shrugged, a recent
television movie version, never having read the longer book
by Ayn Rand, though it seems to be based upon this same
premise, where another world exists outside the ordinary
realm, having cracked open the threshold allowing access
to other dimensionality. the third part of the film is to be
released in the next summer, apparently. in any case,
interesting times ahead if this is indeed possible...

excellent point- i will be posting a follow-up section on troubleshooting
with another strategy related to this and more information. thanks

@_date: 2013-12-20 21:49:15
@_author: brian carroll 
@_subject: PVDF strategies - (06) 
a general situation and condition has been described,
relating piezo film (PVDF) with issues of free energy
and also 'non-electromagnetic' if not 'non-acoustic'
transfer of power and perhaps information likewise.
yet there is a problem encountered as mentioned,
regarding challenges to achieving an ~8 Hz vibration
at the given scale, which may be an issue connected
with do-it-yourself approaches versus a manufacturing
approach, and the technological tools and equipment
available to investigate these dynamics at the scale
of breadboards, microcontrollers, and PVDF elements.
can the existing 'size' of an PVDF electronic component
actually register the approximate ~8 Hz vibration of the
Schumann resonance?
from what i have read in the technical manual (p.2), the
piezo film material is capable of registering vibration at
this frequency [1] and in fact is so sensitive in its use
as in contact microphone applications that shielding is
required to reduce unwanted vibrations [2] in a context
of 'vibration sensing' which also applies when attached
to music instruments [3]. with this in mind, it appears
that the PVDF film element is hypersensitive to any
vibration depending on the surface it is attached to.
in other words, if there is an ~8 Hz vibration occurring,
it would seem likely if not probable that the PVDF film
tab is potentially capable of sending it, given enough
knowledge and whatever equipment required to do so.
so enough of the hypotheticals, i may have forgotten
to emphasize if not mention an important observation.
several weeks ago there was an (urls) list sent that
had information about a NOVA science program that
just aired on Public Television (PBS) in the U.S. and
i saw the last 20 minutes or so of that show, as was
conveyed on that post. [4] [5] the expert interviewed
for the program, Earle R. Williams [6] mentioned the
Global AC Circuit and described research occurring
in a rural Rhode Island experiment that has been
studying this for decades, based on groundbreaking
ideas of a previous researcher who pioneered the field
of atmospheric electricity.
and what Mr. Williams said and demonstrated in this
interview was astonishing to hear. basically, if memory
serves: any antenna on earth picks up this frequency
of the Schumann resonance, which he said was ~8 Hz.
(presumably equates to 'metal antennas' i am guessing,
of the kind found on radios and televisions.)
the very interesting aspect about this, 'context' as it were,
is that this research hut for atmospheric electricity was
old technology -- basically an antenna in a very remote area
to minimize electromagnetic interference (EMI) from what is
the buzzing infrastructure of wired and wireless civilization.
the other aspect is that Mr. Williams stated, if remembering,
that all that is needed is an antenna and oscilloscope to
verify the signal is there. meaning: get a metal antenna,
have it grounded or whatever is necessary, and then attach
it to a visual feedback system and locate the 8 Hz signal.
"spikes" that occur within the signal, atop the frequency
of the Schumann resonance, are lightning strikes. as if
the earth-ionosphere cavity may have some aspect of an
echo chamber (my phrasing), though also it was stated,
again, if remembering correctly, that lighting strikes can
travel up to 2.5 times around the earth, which feeds this
resonance and supports and sustains this wavelength
that is vibrating on all antennas everywhere the same.
so in some sense these are clues, signs of what exists,
what the parameters are. people who know how to use
an oscilloscope and basic antenna are that much closer
to the issue than those who do not, and likewise, those
who can program a microcontroller and write code, etc.
so incorporating this as additional information into the
existing approach and ideas, along with helpful feedback
that questions the starting investigation in its parameters,
it seems possible that experimentation could begin within
a PVDF film sensor context, if having the tools, technology,
and ideas to shape and evaluate and test these conditions.
though further, it is also probable that specifically designing
a PVDF sensor for this particular application would be the
more direct investigation. both approaches could be viable.
in other words, the as-is approach relying on existing
piezo sensors could yield some interesting and unexpected
discoveries, and perhaps break this open into another realm.
and so how to do that is a question: how to tune the element,
how to approach it, what are the actual issues involved, etc.
for instance, consider the PVDF film itself as a rectangle
that can register vibrations via touching a vibrating surface;
this versus having the PVDF film itself resonate, vibrating
based on its being a quasi free-standing antenna. these
different approaches both could potentially access 8 Hz
though via different strategies and frameworks.
my assumption is is that rectangle of the sensor itself
is capable of picking up 'multiple frequencies' at a given
time, depending on what exists as a signal. and thus, if
in a musical approach, it may have 'multiple tunings' even
that coexist on the vibrating surface, whether freestanding
or registering movement from an attached vibrating surface.
and so the issue can be of filtering these signals to focus
the sensor into a given range. and how this is done could
effect its 'efficiency' in terms of energy collection, because
a stronger versus weaker signal could exist, if muddled by
others that counteract its pendulum-like wave movement. if
this way, dampening of the vibration via weights may allow
no movement in certain frequencies, whereas a software
filter could only edit them out while they still exist as an
active force, perhaps removing energy from or competing
with a given frequency or signal from the wanted range.\
so capturing different frequencies simultaneously (good
for crypto and energy harvesting, perhaps) vs. focusing on
a given range (better for Schumann resonance seemingly)
and yet here's the thing--
like a drum skin, how is this elusive jabberwocky of the
Schumann resonance of ~8 Hz ever going to be accessed
if it cannot be readily encountered. what can capture that
wave vibration, at that particular very long wavelength. and
(due to no memory, i get to ask such rhetorical questions)
this is what triggered my memory about the antennas, that
all antennas vibrate at this frequency, or so the expert said.
though also, considering the drum approach, this then got
me thinking- instead of a free standing 'energy antenna',
would it not be possible to use a PVDF sensor to measure
and also pick up this 8 Hz vibration on an antenna instead?
in that if the antenna is vibrating at 8 Hz, could this vibration
be 'harvested' and establish mechanical vibration in these
highly sensitive piezo films, to then build up AC current in
via their capacitance, building up and storing this charge...
in other words: PVDF + ~8 Hz antenna freq. => energy
if there were no limits to exploration and equipment could
be used to custom manufacture prototypes for this purpose,
what would an antenna look like that vibrates only at this
targeted frequency... and thus, another strategy could
involve custom manufacture of the piezo film element,
such that its surface has an antenna etched onto it,
that is made to vibrate at the Schumann resonance,
for instance a particular geometry, grid, array, pattern.
i have read about antennas and they are based upon
geometric proportion to the wavelength, so 'size' does
not necessarily correlate to frequency in terms of larger
antennas for bigger wavelengths, (if i am not mistaken).
instead, the issue of alignment between a signal and
an antenna involves a matched or paired geometrical
structure that can effectively map signals onto antennas
and then coherently deliver this signal into a circuit. likely
as cleanly and crisply as is possible, mathematics then
determining these models and design approaches. thus,
fractal antennas are an area where 'scale' is exampled
other than a yagi or dipole. and cellphones in particular
appear to make very tiny antennas or utilize unique
approaches to make them invisible even, via how the
device is grounded and where the wires are hidden,
perhaps related to signal strength and also 'length'.
so in some sense, maybe size and scale do matter
and in some sense maybe size and scale are not the
most critical factors in given applications. maybe a
larger power source requires a larger antenna and
smaller applications only need smaller antennas.
what i want to convey is that this 'etched on' approach
where an antenna structure could be engineered onto
the piezo film surface -- (such that it would vibrate at
the given frequency and then stress the sensor, in
turn generating power via its constant movement) --
has correlation with a circuit - perhaps soldertrace,
that is the antenna. so imagine a rectangle with a
single loop of a given geometry that would somehow
function as a single-frequency antenna and vibrate,
and thus stress/strain, compression/decompression
of that metal structure would flex the piezo film that
it is attached to, and be designed to maximize the
surface area with this specific tuned geometry that
can focus in on just those signals or vibrations, as
simple as an anode and cathode attached to it, yet
if correlating other approaches, perhaps etched to
a nanosurface-level with fractal patterns even that
could maximize voltage, if possible, or increase
capacitance or whatever else may be optimized
for energy harvesting of ~8 Hz signal vibrations.
so, to simplify, imagine 'the cantilever' that is the
concept already for the piezo film tab, a rectangle
that moves back and forth on axis, and in doing so
creates and stores charge that then can be dumped
into a circuit, bit by bit if momentary, and seemingly
constant alternating current if the signal is constant.
the additional etched pattern atop the sensor, this
being an additional layer, could be considered 'the
antenna' for accessing Schumann resonance. yet,
it could also be conceptualized as a cantilever that
is in addition to the piezo device itself, also this.
my vagueness here is not intentional, trying to write
into a particular direction and context whereby this
'tuned antenna' atop a cantilever instead becomes
this cantilever via a different manufacturing process,
whereby the PVDF device is itself tuned to ~8 Hz,
& moreso, perhaps taking on the form of cantilever.
such that, the piezo elemen becomes a tuning fork
that is tuned for this specific vibrational frequency,
and then anode/cathode, into associated circuitry
precedent, and note 'the scale' here, is with MEMs
devices and micromachines and nanoscale devices
where such extreme miniature 'antennas' can already
be constructed and vibrate at known frequencies, and
they take on the form of a cantilever (same functioning
as energy harvesting sensors, as vibrating pendulums)
and thus micro and nano radios can be made and
other devices, where under microscope a furious
activity is observed of what is basically a tuning fork
that is naturally vibrating via its 'tuned resonance',
(if not mistaken in interpretation of these events).
so at this unobservable visual scale, little cantilevers
can be made to vibrate via their tuning, and function
essentially the same as cantilevers that at this scale
are not envisioned or conceptualized to auto-vibrate
via paired resonance. why is that i wonder, (embargo
on thoughts, experiment, or secret domain perhaps)
just consider a watch, the mechanisms required to
wind and keep the watch spinning its intricate gears,
as this relates to pendulum movement. now what if
a cantilever existed that could vibrate automatically
at ~8 Hz, and thus no more batteries, solar cell, nor
wind-up mechanisms would be needed to provide the
motive power need for its clockwork movement. and
in this way, likewise- the cantilever is the antenna.
the concept of the sensor as mechanical cantilever
in its multiuse form, instead being reimagined as a
tuned rectangle with additional layer of antenna, this
as cantilever, or further, no rectangle and instead the
PVDF is made into a cantilever, tuning fork vibrating
at the frequency of the Schumann resonance, and in
this way, potentially replacing batteries given the size
of the cantilever and its effectiveness or efficiency.
another way to consider this in terms of electronics
and circuits is the (radio again) crystal oscillator that
is included as a stand-alone timing device, matched to
a particular frequency, lets say ~8 Hz for example...
as i understand it, electrical current in a circuit - say
involving resistors, capacitors, relays, switches, and
wires on a prototyping breadboard - moves throughout
this maze of components and can send electrons into
the crystal oscillator, a timing device, that is activated
by this electricity and generates a particular frequency
in response to its being electrified, formatting resulting
output as a given frequency, here 8 Hz, back into the
circuit, where it could be used say by an IC chip that
uses it to count cycles that trigger other activity, say
an LED display that moves up a number every million
cycles and continually counts 0-9 and starts over again.
so the idea here is that this electronics component is
partly doing what the PVDF sensor is, only in reverse.
what the crystal "quartz" oscillator does is vibrate at
a particular frequency (~8 Hz) which is the goal, and
this is already achieved in a device related in some
way already to piezo sensors (see: quartz). the main
difference is that it requires external energy to generate
the signal or the vibrations, (though if it were tuned to
~8 hz, might it vibrate without any external power?)...
     energy (in) ==> crystal oscillator ==> 8 Hz vibration (out)
to put it another way, in terms of active concepts...
     electricity ==> vibration ==> timing
in other words, in traditional radio or other timing circuits
reliant upon crystal oscillators, electrical current (power)
is input into the component that then "vibrates" at a given
frequency, and then this signal is output as 'time' into the
circuit, whereby the electrical current has this geometric
patterning mapped into its structure which is then utilized
by related or connected components, to format other action.
what the piezo film sensor does is exactly the opposite:
    timing ==> vibration ==> electricity
it takes some regular mechanical vibration when attached
to a surface, and this vibration strains the sensor which in
turn generates electrical charge via piezo electric properties
and then stores this charge via its capacitance, which then
can be output into the connected circuitry as AC electrical
current. the main issue appears to focus upon controlling
the timing or frequency, via TUNING the device (that is,
creating a cantilever or antenna to automatically vibrate)
in other words, if the 'timing' between the PVDF or other
piezo sensor and the Schumann resonance could be
established, matched in shared resonance (A=A) such
that the 8 Hz signal would directly map to an antenna
or cantilever structure tuned specifically for 8 Hz, then:
    matched-timing ==> perpetual vibration ==> free electricity
where 'matched-timing' is pairing of signal with antenna
of the piezo sensor (cantilever or not) in that the geometry
is aligned (A=A) which then accesses and sustains this
connection of 8 Hz vibration via 'shared resonance' that is
a transfer of energy from the earth/ionosphere cavity, to
the surface of the earth. the critical issue appears to be
~adjustable tuning of an antenna to allow for drift, such
that "tuning" differences both small (Aa=Ab) and large
(A=B) can be adjusted for, which also occurs in a realm
of electronics and watchmaking, if not mistaken, that an
additional level of fine-tuning and adjustkbility is involved
and required in such intricate small scale technological
if other ecosystems, because variances may exist/persist
does this mean also that a crystal oscillator [7] is a step
or two away from providing power to a circuit if only tuned
to ~8 Hz - it would probably involve whatever piezo aspect
of crystals, if they could output current as piezo sensors,
when vibrating at this frequency, thus an issue of locating
or manufacturing such crystals, tuning them as antennas.
(should Superman be mentioned here, or metaphysics of
crystals, predecessor to electronics, original components
of nature, such that this is the foundation of the study, in
this way, so too amber and lodestone, known or unknown)
the key idea then is of tuning piezos, whereby the piezo
element is itself the antenna, and this could be explored
in various ways, etched onto the surface of an existing
sensor element, such as with PVDF film tabs, or made
into a cantilever such as a tuning fork vibrating at ~8 Hz
that outputs energy into a self via its perpetual motion,
and further, crystal oscillators tuned to this frequency
of the Schumann resonance, if capable of generating or
outputting electricity via alignment with this frequency,
tuned into it in terms of energy harvesting versus timing
for circuits or for receiving or transmitting radio waves.
note: again, this is non-electromagnetic vibration that
is accessed, so oscillators and piezos are functioning
in an undescribed realm at macroscale, though within
effects _known within music (as natural philosophy),
described by composer/filmmaker Helen Hall. [8]
the mythos involved includes a realm of the forbidden
and of the fringe activity of outlawed energy research,
access to 'free energy' that is believed to have earlier
been accessed on earth by its inhabitants yet since
disappeared within civilization, vanished along with
its cosmology (of the aether), the plenum seemingly,
edited out, removed from view via Michelson-Morley.
and yet the idea of limitless energy, locating it as if an
issue of dousing within the electromagnetic framework
with various strange machines and contraptions, those
seeking to tap into it, upon relating to and realizing its
mystery that surrounds, encompasses, defines and yet
cannot be tangibly defined in these same terms it exists
because the basic model and approach are off, and just
enough to send things in another direction, still unaware
in other words, there is potential energy all around, the
issues of dead cellphones after 5 hours moot should a
small cantilever antenna find geometrical alignment that
replaces its power source with one non-electromagnetic,
non-polluting, attuned to nature and mind, in harmony
and related to the larger order, not existing to destroy it.
how to tap into it, where is it. how do you get there if
electromagnetism is off-limits to investigation beyond
an ideology of a protective technological priesthood.
and then, how to imagine beyond electromagnetism
if concepts are not understanding of this condition
firstly, to realize what the encountered issues are,
so that reasoning is possible in a shared framework
the larger question, how to tap into the infinity that is
within the electromagnetic circuit, open up that seam
between zero and infinity, and use it to turn things at
higher speeds and momentums or with greater force,
limitless power of any magnitude, seemingly. this is
essentially to break out of relativity and back into a
non-warped model of nature, so anti-gravity and other
such issues are basic and easy to advance beyond,
though if living within lies of a false perspective this is
not possible. so the worldview has to be taken down
before any landspeeders are going to arrive in town

this issue, which is an easy round number to recall that

heading down the final stretch...
my fascination with sensors as an electronics concept
began with small pamphlet electronics instruction books
from Forrest Mims [0] found Shack though they
are widely available online these days. [1]  if interested
in programming microcontrollers though have not been
introduced via non-computer breadboard electronics, it
may be of interest to look at and learn from circuits in
these notebooks, which provide basic concepts for how
the circuits work and the principles they involve. for a
technical person it could be instructive, for those like
myself with a mental gap in the fundamentals there
may still be questions that need to be answered
before able to access and intuitively understand
exactly what is going on, modifying it from there
so, engineering mindset, great resource. artistic
mindset, perhaps still a significant boundary before
understanding though i have trouble with reading and
ambiguous concepts so it could be only my limitation
that kept me from learning the basics of electronics
in terms of circuitry. another is: having the parts that
are needed, versus just looking at the diagrams and
understanding what is happening, or using these for
reference, to build other circuits via same approach
or extending or borrowing certain parts of designs.
quite interesting to locate a Mims book on sensors
and piezo kit together in regard to ongoing issues
with piezo sensors and energy harvesting. [2]
what captured my imagination was the particular
notebook on sensors, their conceptual nature as
this relates to issues of feedback and intelligence
that effectively maps onto switches and gauges
as measurements of activity, indicators of events;
likewise, the reversibility of sensors, how some if
not many can be inverted in their functioning, such
that a microphone can be a speaker and vice versa
PVDF piezo film as a sensor material exemplifies
the tremendous range that a given material and its
properties can connect with, in varying dynamics
and dimensions. (if not mistaken, it can even detect
airflow while potentially creating air flow likewise)
and so one of these unique properties of piezo film
is that it can detect temperature differences. this
got me wondering (reading of its application in the
tech manual), that given its incredible sensitivity,
would it be able to detect electromagnetic fields
due to the gradiated change in radiation levels
surrounding wires, in proximity to EMF signals
this combined with the idea of the PVDF sensor
as an ANTENNA then had me wondering if this
could function in a similar realm as the standard
linear Hall effect sensor [3] that senses magnetic
fields and functions as a strain gage (analog) or
on/off switch (binary/digital) in the presence of
electromagnetic fields. and thus EMF meters,
most presumably, utilized Hall effect sensors
that have multiple axes, 1-axis to 3-axis that
relate to the geometry of the EM field in space,
and thus rotating a probe for an EMF meter in
a given context which generate varying signal,
helping define the shape and direction of the
signal, as it is positioned in space [4] [5]
so my thinking was as follows... there are these
small piezo sensor 'film tabs' that can be hooked
up to a speaker, and if they could detect signals
from home wiring in the wall, as a microphone,
then essentially it approximates an EMF meter
without the display details, though could indicate
an intensity level by how loud or soft the noise
that is picked up. perhaps this is actually not
possible though it my questioning of its use.
and this could require holding or moving the
piezo film tab, the rectangle with an audio
cable connected to it, then connected with a
small preamp/mixer, amplifier or headphones,
and perhaps moving it along the wall -- which
seems unlikely due to sensitivity -- because it
would generate massive noise seemingly, or,
to potentially move it in the air, likewise that
could seemingly make lots of noise by its
movement, masking any other signals.
it seems to go nowhere as an approach,
yet my question remains that if this PVDF
material can and does function as an antenna
and it could pick up signals via vibrations, that
perhaps if it was held or moved against a wall
with electrical wiring inside, it could access
this intense vibrational activity in some way
it is obviously unclear as an approach, as
multiple aspects coincide, both in attempting
to access a signal and how this could occur...
and thus: the issue could be having the PVDF
film tab register 'temperature variation' as a way
to monitor the difference in heat between a less
electromagnetic realm and more electromagnetic
realm as the radiation is monitored by the sensor
and is this possible or not. and further, would the
fact that the device is a capacitor then influence
its charge via induction, such that the EMFs
would charge the PVDF film, again via vibration
or heat, though which could be used as electricity
in a circuit it connects to, via energy harvesting.
the concept is that the EMF meter as device
would generate power when detecting signals.
and so the existing rectangular film tabs [6] are
potentially one way of going about this, in terms
of 'mapping temperature' as mapping of EMFs,
and seemingly related to this is the issue of the
sensor being shielded or not, as this potentially
relates to issues of tuning. what frequency or
temperature range can influence the sensor
a hypothetical application the PVDF sensor
used for mapping out EMFs, is that a cellphone
could contain such a device and be held against
the wall or on a shelf in which there is electrical
wiring, and the induction that occurs from the
wires to the capacitor via vibration of EMFs
could in effect provide charging power to the
cellphone or other once-battery-reliant device,
if energy harvesting was paired with wiring in
the home and electrical power already in place,
it would be an issue of locating it, excavating
a hidden environment, so the EMF meter as
indicator of signal strength or of radiation levels
as temperature could provide a diagnostic of a
local area via mapping it out as EM environment,
and then situate devices in this specific location,
in proximity to wires to maximize energy harvest
via vibration that perpetually charges the capacitor
(note here: if the PVDF film were etched as was
previously mentioned with further patterning, this
could massively increase voltage potentially, via
increasingly its capacitance or storage capacity
for holding energy, seemingly of higher voltage)
though what really got my mind spinning was
the idea of another format for this piezo polymer
and that is 'piezo coaxial cable'. [7] [8]
in that, this idea of PVDF as an antenna then is
tending towards a shape or form that has been
used for antennas, that is: a length of wire that
picks up signals as wavelengths geometrically
align with, map onto, influence its properties.
(that is, if not mistaken in how things work)
and so my mind starts thinking of making a
loop out of this cable, as if a transponder that
is used to track some emitting signal, or as a
certain type of TV console antenna even, if not
rabbit ears in retrospect. and what is the actual
difference in these different materials functioning,
plain metal and piezo polymer, in terms of antenna
the obvious is that the latter generates power if it
begins to vibrate. and holds onto it as a capacitor,
so it builds up and stores the external influence.
though more, consider the issue of high-voltage,
that a long length of wire could potentially hold a
lot of charge. and this in a context of sensing...
there is the classic example of 'wireless power'
in a person holding fluorescent tube lights under
the powerlines of a high-voltage pylon corridor
that in turn illuminates the lights via EMFs by
way of the surrounding intense levels of radiation
that bathe the area in proximity to such towers
so there is massive energy in the air, ionizing it,
around high voltage electric transmission towers,
enough to light a fluorescent (AC) lightbulb that
otherwise requires a ballast/transformer to do so
(again, if not mistaken), in that charge/electrons
are rapidly moving back and forth through a gas
held inside the unlit tube that then generates light
by triggering a reaction that releases or produces
photons via the current shooting through the gas
(sidenote: LEDs interesting in similar way, light
or photons produced by jumping gap in a circuit)
note: DANGER: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DO THIS
WITHOUT PROPER EXPERTISE/QUALIFICATIONS...
now imagine you have a loop of piezo coaxial cable
that can function as an antenna. potentially and-or
seemingly, it would be able to 'read' the temperature
difference via the radiation in the area underneath or
nearby similar high-voltage towers. though this may
co-exist as a variable with frequency/vibration thus
heat may just be another way of saying the same
thing, though in a more tangible or perceivable way,
in that its influence may be more apparent.
here is why it is not advisable for a do-it-yourselfer-
because any length of this piezo cable is a capacitor
that can store energy, and the larger the cable the
more voltage that could be stored, it would appear,
and thus if such an antenna were use and capable
of storing large amounts of high voltage charge, it
then could be deadly dangerous to be holding onto
this cable because it would be inducing current from
the powerlines and potentially into the body, in terms
of its grounding (say, straight through an arm to heart
then out one foot or both) potentially like getting hit
by lightning. any precautions that would be taken
by electrical workers that work on high voltage lines
would be relevant as security precautions for any
such experimentation. and yet, if a circuit were
made around such an antenna -- potentially via
paired or matching VIBRATION alone, this same
piezo cable device could potentially provide much
more power and current via its energy harvesting.
(or so it is speculated here)
in a more removed situation, or a smaller antenna,
it could potentially be used to map EMFs via piezo
wire in the way Hall effect sensors are used today,
though again with the benefit of energy harvesting
and providing power to circuitry. thus piezo cable,
as antenna, could have its own unique attributes
and properties that could better align in certain
situations or circumstances to provide power or
function as an antenna, whereby the 'microphone'
or listening is occurring in a vibrational realm that
is not connected to material vibration beyond its
own support structure, instead, as antenna it is
tuning into strong fields (as heat, here proposed)
that would potentially be capable of providing this
source of vibrational needed to power circuitry,
yet further, also a signal of meaning about the
nature of the environment in its electromagnetic
composition and ordering, mapping or direction
based on these attributes, features of landscape
that is relevant in terms of health and energy
so then i was done with thinking about it and
then encountered a photograph that inspired
another layer of thinking within this domain...
it was of a woman's hat [9] created by a fashion
designer that spoke to these issues in terms of
its language and aesthetics, providing insight into
the nature of the questions involved.
what if, for instance, the piezo film tab sensors
were able to monitor the heat or radiation as this
correlates to vibrational frequencies of cellphones
as they are held against the skull, and evaluate
the radiation involved at the blood-brain barrier as
this influences tumor development in humans via
sending this transmission of cellphone signals
from the phone to the cellular towers? in other
words, what if this little sensor could be placed
on a hat, alongside the surface of the skin, and
register and monitor the radiation levels from
omnidirectional antennas shooting EMFs and
coded patterns into the human brain, as part of
this relation between people, tools, technology
and infrastructure - "daily ~communionication"
again, the wonders of the piezo film indicate that
they do respond to monitoring of skin, and thus
likely a viable approach to modeling this relation,
and testing against "official evidence" about how
these antennas and vibrations are influencing the
human physiology. real-time cellphone monitoring
(another approach could involve a PVDF sensor at
the only opening of an otherwise EMF-opaque box
or container that has a cellphone in it, attempting to
transmit or radiate its signal, and measuring activity
via vibration or heat from this at various distances)
additional hats provided further insight into aspects
of multiple tunings [10] via adjusting cantilevers or
tuning forks, to what frequencies are related to and
through, as part of consciousness as information,
this in a non-electromagnetic framework seemingly.
and also of the nature of the mind being targeted by
hostile signaling [11] in these toxic domains of the
technical wilderness, functioning against humanity.
in that disease and illness correlate with these same
issues as they remain ignored and unaddressed, and
allowing continuing abuse of power based on hidden
leverage that results from no checks and balances
upon unrestrained technological development for
private goals and agendas, against public interest
the kicker is that such technology could already be
deployed in a hidden framework or context, just as
it is hard to imagine ubiquitous mass surveillance via
technological infrastructure without this corresponding
in some significant way to a paid informant network on
the ground, in close proximity, allowing full spectrum
monitoring that tends towards gossip as power that
is exploited in the political bias within infrastructure,
emperor no clothes policy laid bare via own tattle tales
thus, what if likewise, the potential for such sensing as
harvesting of free energy already exists yet remains in
a realm of secrecy, leveraged against populations on
the outside of this inner society. what if different truths
exist that remain unaccounted for, different economics
that then become the basis for exploitation via illusion,
via not sharing the discoveries and using this for power,
to take over domains via ruse, deception, ill-intent, etc
in other words: the conspiracy revealed, now out in the open...
take for instance the unusual aesthetics of a local substation
for electric power 'delivery', like a router, bus, or hub that then
transforms the voltage en route to its destination. under the
ordinary or standard model of power distribution, this could
be assumed to function in one way and one way only...
powerplant ==> transmission towers ==> substation ==> distribution poles
that is, the power is generated at a power station, moved
through high-voltage cables suspended from towers to a
substation, where this power is stepped down and then
further distributed via wooden poles to various dwellings
though 'the antennas' could be for lightning protection, it
seems highly unusual to have a large array of them or at
least this design approach has not yet been encountered
before this, and calls into question what is new about it.
i had previously speculated it was a free energy substation
tapping into atmospheric electricity via the antennas, though
until the PVDF sensors did not understand how this might be
possible. in fact, thinking about it right now, combining piezo
antennas with HAARP atmospheric injections of frequency is
potentially the model for remote power delivery at national or
international scale, ala Nikola Telsa's Wardenclyffe Tower [13]
in this scenario, the substation would be the 'generator' in that
it could tune into a given vibration (perhaps Schumann resonance)
and create high voltage electricity on-site, via remote transfer of
energy -as information- seemingly, outside an electromagnetic
context yet tied back into it via properties of nature, its order.
in this way, power delivery could begin at the substation locally,
then distribute back outwards to both high-voltage lines and the
reduced-voltage distribution poles, from the substation itself, a
decentralized power generation and delivery system, in effect,
locally, though harmonized at a larger scale via atmospheric
electricity as the generator or transmitter of 'motive power',
if not conceptualizing this in error. that would be the illusion,
that the powerplant is sending the power and not substation
 substation ==> transmission/distribution ==> local power
thus like a crystal oscillator functioning in reverse as piezo sensor,
if 'free energy' were being harvested at the substation-level, then a
different organization of these relations exists than what is said to
exist and used as a basis for top-down power structures in society.
a decentralized, distributed, non-toxic energy that is limitless versus
an infrastructure based on oil and gasoline and goal and nuclear energy
that is destructive, basically raping the earth and likewise its inhabitants
to fuel a given insane development strategy functioning against humanity
as this aligns with 'green politics' and 'environmentalism', its politics and
moral agenda within what is a warped accounting for various such factors.
in other words, perhaps battery power is only an issue for those on
the outside of this. if it indeed were to exist as a parallel infrastructure
in the everyday environment. and maybe that is being used as leverage,
a secret hidden development with different economics, social dynamics,
and political goals that are not 'represented' in existing language, instead
functioning outside or beyond its limiting frameworks and outdated views
and beliefs, which provide cover and camouflage for sustaining trickery,
exploiting it, and securing its place in relation to the rogue world state,
thoroughly invested in its mission to serve its hidden special interests,
having divested humanity long ago for private rewards in doing so.
wouldn't it be nice to see a circuit diagram of how those antennas
are hooked up at the substation. really interesting if it involved more
than 'ground' and instead was part of a piezo-based energy harvesting
engine capable of generating constant high-voltage power, for instance.
and who would the power to such oversight to occur within society?
seemingly nobody. that is the entirety of the situation right there-

i did not connect the two themes together until now,
 though consider again the residential high rise building
 with an antenna array on top, previously sent to the list,
 in the context that it could be harvesting its own power
 and disconnected from the surrounding energy grid via
 the antenna array at its crown. off the books energy, at
 the same time brutal wars fought to sustain oil power...
 (how is that for ethics and morality of secret leadership,
 and issues of corruption, deception, hidden evil agenda)
 in other words: the antennas are for capturing energy and
 not just for communications signals, a la piezo technology
 again, how to audit the circuitry involved. who has authority

i think this is actually the model for human beings as conceived
in long ago times, though may be mistaken. in the Middle Ages
or thereafter, the nervous system itself was medically illustrated
as a plant, held within the watery container of the liquid body, in
this way, in the abstract, not unlike a jellyfish with mobile ocean
again, if memory serves, perhaps it was Plato who described
also the nature of thought in terms of the brain, its enlightenment,
whereby the roots of the nervous system flower into an open mind
which receives light and nourishment from truth, tracking it this way
as flowers situate themselves according to environment, nutrients
so the idea of 'plants' and ~enlightenment, 'knowing' as this relates
to truth and essentially grounding informational and physical realms,
perhaps some kind of natural alignment taking place, harmonization
that is organic, an aspect of ecological foundation and its circuitry,
potentially then scaled to the cosmos, especially with regard to the
theories of origins via panspermia [1], ye olde mushroom astronauts,
delivering life onto earth via asteroid or comets, seeding the oceans;
in this way, sentience of octopus, dolphins, their social intelligence
and awareness, consciousness, alike with jellyfish, as if homologue
with pre-embedded state of nervous system for humans, in vitro (?)
prior to final packaging of mammalian biped and adjustable thumbs
the idea that all life moves towards higher consciousness and that
intelligence and this yearning motivation for greater truth is life, its
force, the trajectory of the grand design from nano- to macro-scale,
issues of culture, freedom, war, occurring at all scales, to survive,
conquer, for what means and ends, what principles, or darkness if
bounded by the false, those who serve it, obey it as if the master.
here cybernetic feedback likewise at all interconnected levels else
its incapacitation, making the living captive to those ceasing to live,
to grow, to evolve beyond existing constraints, limited beliefs, ideas.
the fix of ideology the danger, wrong assumptions and modeling or
subversion of view and awareness to contain, trap, mislead, control
so the idea of information related to intelligence connected with this
condition of LIFE, perhaps related also to plants and awareness, of
a natural condition of sentience even, perhaps, as biome, as with
the Gaia hypothesis of earth as supraorganism, living entity unto
itself as a larger totality or 'living ecosystem', [2] Earth as being.
i think also the book A Guide for the Perplexed delved into this
area in terms of a progression of life, from mineral to vegetable to
animal to human. [3] if not mistaken, from evaluating the wikipedia
page, the issue of nesting exists in that each higher form of life has
within it those underneath it; thus the human is inextricably related
to the mineral, vegetative, animalistic, of which they are composed,
as this also effects consciousness, awareness, and intelligence [4]
a personal experience about this issue of 'living ecosystems' that
themselves may have a larger awareness or consciousness than
just the part -- say, a forest as a supraorganism that is sentient...
(developed a close connection and friendship with a wild deer and
learned how to communicate with her. then observed behavior in
various settings, role of muteness, listening, scent, wind, shiny
objects, distance, motion, fear, nutrition, locomotion, etc. and
when relocating the deer into a more wilderness environment,
it became apparent how she was one-with-the-environment in
a way that an urban park did not allow, as if in wrong circuitry;
deer can basically disappear within a few feet in a forest, and
be totally silent at the same time as observing you searching
for them or just moving past, through their domain. then in the
effort to communicate, connection with camouflage and trees
and leaves helped realize how antlers are very much like sticks,
and how 'eyes' on trees, openings in the bark, are like those of
deer and other animals watching or monitoring the area, each
connected to the others, as part of a larger connected system.
as if all eyes of the forest even. part of a larger awareness and
knowing this, having this as consciousness, shared circuitry.
in other words the deer is the forest, the forest is the deer,
the tree is the deer, the deer is the tree, a hidden symbiotic
relation or structural connectivity that goes beyond one entity
or one life, and spans across them as a larger, longer relation
as if functioning together, moving in a shared direction, thus
life dependent on other life, in terms of its dynamic circuitry,
then stresses, pressures, motivations occurring against this)
should have also mentioned issues of governance related to
consciousness and intelligence, knowledge and awareness
as they rely on shared structures and foundations (circuitry)
that allow self-sustaining or connected systems to develop
within certain parameters, and thus origin stories of rocks
and minerals connected with cosmological big bang and
development of universe, galaxies, solar system, planets;
this then physics and chemistry, molecules moving into a
realm of organisms, life, and of vegetation and plants, thus
biology, botany, chemistry, horticulture, (if not aspects of
archaeology, paleontology in terms of research & studies),
then into fauna, animals, realm of biology and zoology if
not anthropology, to move into sociology, anthropology,
economics, politics, culture, 'arts', architecture, crypto.
(note here- question of crypto at mineral and vegetable,
not just present-day context of p2p computer exchange)
also note the role of behaviorist science to treat humans
only as animals, lowering their intellectual status via a
limited model of existence to Darwinian framework that
squares humans with apes, not divine entities or origin,
as this relates to loss of empirical truth, logic, reasoning
within society then enforced by universities, psychiatry
in particular, where 'medicine' helps this devolutionary
process occur, in the black arts of political diagnoses
that reverse the alchemical process: lead to gold via
toxic pills that destroy circuitry and the ability to think,
all to uphold a worldview of humans as merely animals,
managed as livestock, routed to holocaust cattle chutes
here, the ideology buttressed by anthropological skulldiggery
and archaeological equivalence, the sociological likewise as
if all are the same, no matter if ascending or descending in
relation to having once previously ascended or descended,
such that apes becoming more human-like, humans more
apelike, humans more humans, apes more and more ape;
and hell, why not reference Planet of the Apes once again
as a context for Lincoln related civil war of said ideology
so behaviorism backed up by 'political sciences' as cult,
as this translates into a dumbing-down and enforcement
of status quo dynamics, moving from human to the animal,
vegetable, & mineral, the more robotic, base the interactions
and so consciousness, awareness, intelligence, communication
becoming less and less overt time, bounded by psychiatric limits
of what that is perceptible is acceptable in given frameworks, the
'brain police' monitoring everyone as potentially out of control apes,
this slavery, contained within a ideology that has become the state,
requires certain beliefs and conformance to illusory representations
and obey is the only option- or else, there goes your mind & body
biome again, people living in toxic realm, despoiled environment
then forcibly adapted to it if not by peer pressure as selection,
the most unfit and mediocre the champions and successors in
wasteland, just follow brain-dead rules of the machine to survive;
(if that does not work, take these pills and start behaving or else;
children as young as 2 y.o. being dosed by psychiatrists to rewire
troubled beings in such a hellhole, killing off any chance of survival
before turning completely bonkers when cerebrum lights all at once,
essentially programming population of mind-controlled psychopaths;
forgot implant antenna, deranged psych pills enough to circuit design)
so peoples in mental institutions often referred to as vegetables,
as with those brain dead in hospitals, else comatose, operating or
existing in a realm beyond. catatonia, etc. as this tends also to a
realm of mootness, or otherness, perhaps related to the autistic,
of a bounded or limited realm where communication is not occurring
yet should be or once did, those somehow is miswired or rewired
and thus the circuits are not connected or integrated to enable
the internal/external relation, as if person trapped inside the self
and how this relates to communication and balancing, processing
of stimuli, how to make sense of what is going on, especially if
living in a frenetic world that does not make sense to begin with
the correlation to this general condition (it as nausea, malaise)
is a Spore-like entity that can function as essentially brainless,
mindless, and make-do and make-their-way in the labyrinth as
if dungeon master granted special powers and abilities. this is
The Beast known as feelings-only, who matches phase change
and state to what is liked and not liked, what makes happy or
sad or mad, mediating existence on these immediate terms
without capacity, depth, or willingness to consider beyond this
quasi-emotional framework, detached from larger grounding in
surrounding truth, such that judgement can be immediate as
to sensory perception, yet also disconnected from the larger
reality, and instead function as delusion state of being and
mistaken awareness. these people become MANAGERS
(a joke here), many times. and compliance to rules, other
beliefs in a too-simple and stupidistic mindset/framework
then orchestrates and elevates the dumb to supremacy as
'true believers' in the warped model, because of its benefits
to them and their kind, without further question or insight;
just following, enforcing, repeating, extending mediocrity
when these types become teachers, in autocratic status-
based hierarchy, 'truth' is legislated by likable beliefs and
those unliked, disfavored, easily censored based on moral
belief in superiority of this lesser and base existence and
way of being and 'thinking' as if a more limited animal, in
that the human becomes a trained ape by such relation,
as it becomes education, career, 'voting', and otherwise
so, choosing to be vegetable, choosing that path, and
communicating or scenting and signaling in that realm,
procreation, spawning more of such kind automatically,
housing, feeding, schooling, refining a given production
to enable such a mindless population to manage us,
the lower then determining actions of those higher in
a realm of functioning, awareness, ideas, capacities;
and because politically correct, illegal to say anything
against this for fear of upsetting those benefiting from it
another aspect is drug culture in the supposedly non-legal
domain though also hypocritically mainstream, thus law
does not apply if favored, yet is used to imprison others
unprotected. professional drug users staying out of prison,
others with any infraction that threaten the state: goodbye
then moralizing about anything from this perspective as if
universal quite problematic, if only for the massive bullshit
factor it involves on a corrupt societal scale, prophets of
counterculture too many to list, though enough shithead
musicians represent into the present day, so it becomes
unnecessary- just turn on media and see the idiots posing
as if enlightened, encultured to wasteland as peak, ideal
instead of base, bottom-feeding, making profit from shit
within this context of counterculture, drug zeitgeist the
counter pendulum to rise of psychiatric and its duplicity,
the structural connection and association with 'new age'
of consciousness, awareness, philosophical beliefs and
questioning of principles, religious, spiritual, every other
so quaaludes and acid trippers reach top of mountain as
Moses' and then fall all the way back down again, repeat
this thousands and millions of times, the more piling on,
and this too a search for enlightenment for many, if not
of destroying the self in order to find the self once again,
the displacement then involving recentering, and a way
into questioning and other way and types of knowing
the problem is that it is removed of its depth, grounding
as ritual and of potential spiritual practice and instead
can function in a realm of the base and profane, and
thus tends towards devolutionary processes rather
than the opposite, indicating growth beyond existing
boundaries, not just in a single realm, though overall,
in the total circuit. for example, you could be in bliss
temporarily yet residing in a shithole for the rest of life
and it may not balance out or move beyond this or
even be able to be sustained, the destructive cycle
where drugs can short-circuit via near-term fixes
for longer-term problems, larger situations beyond
the self, yet drugs can entrap people in their own
smaller worldviews, create boundaries not open up
connections, and rely on synchronizing with sickness
and toxic conditions and become further a part of
its structure, the downward force and momentum,
yet not accounted for this way, taken out of context
that is the bullshit about too-easy enlightenment,
that it is in the pill and not in the self to begin with,
and about access and unlocking and not substituting
a life for a parallel condition existing outside or beyond
it, no longer responsible or responsive to surroundings,
then becoming this ecosystem, eyes and ears of the
drug even, which is the larger point of the vegetative
people becoming cocaine, becoming heroine, they
as if plants, the awareness of 'like=like' then mapping
into consciousness with others and hidden subculture,
knowing who is within a similar domain or functioning
based on subtle clues and intelligence and signaling
who has gone far into the void, who knows what you
know or has seen what you have seen. what kinds of
knowledge, misery, motivations, betrayals, violence,
deceptions. what kind of treachery hangs in the air
as a potential, what parameters or dimensions exist
in superposition that given nearby circuitry could alight
this can be a realm of seers and sages and prophecy,
of intelligence if grounded, connected to ideas, yet it
can as easily lead into babble and vacancy of truth
beyond the illusion, lead astray into further falsity,
and thus how a person is grounded then influences
how drugs effect and their mediation, what results
this could be a healthy controlled practice that is
medicinal and rite-of-passage, or it could lead towards
loss of greater truth or purposes, and people instead
devolving to the drug, becoming trapped, encrypted
in its domain, surrogate yet also societal parasite
doing bidding of forces subhuman, antihuman even
as organisms seek to control and define territory as
ecosystem, the orchid keeping insects alive for its
own good, drugs governing others nervous systems
the plague of their effectiveness is not only in body,
it is also in the brain and mind, where drugs can limit
sensory considerations into a narrow range and thus
'intelligence' can become confined to a smaller world
and view as ecosystem that relies on false constraints
required for the ecosystem to function as it already does
thus institutionalizing what can be inequalities or biases
or injustices to sustain what is a false-consciousness
at the universal level it may be perceived or believed,
in some sense artificial or unnatural, unreal, a fiction
yet inside this circuitry, it may be 'the most real reality'
consider the human entity as circuit, the nervous system
having a spinal column mapping nerves, sensory feedback
of body into brainstem and 'mind', the capital of the column
consider this is a platform for development, and how any
nutrients or vegetation or carnivore activity then influences
this system in its functioning, the parameters it exists and
sustains itself within, in terms of its governance as scaled
to a larger shared relation with others, in structural terms
(ie the state). thus, any atoms and molecules that go into
this feedback-based system have certain functioning that
result in how it all relates, the dynamics of interaction and
exchange, where truth resides and how it is processed,
not totally unlike a pinball game in its tallying of points
so, if eating some minerals, say having water from a
spring, there could be iron in the water that effects how
a person functions, like vitamins, which then programs
certain cells or influences function, say in regard to blood
somehow or various organs that process these nutrients
or manage those parameters as part of total metabolism
water and humans create a circuit. water is a circuit and
humans are a circuit and together they combine. and it
goes into ecosystems, clouds, environment, ground,
such that if the land is toxic the water is likely effected
and thereby the person, even if in trace amounts, as part
of how the larger ecosystem is balanced, finds alignment
and adjusts or adapts or deteriorates in given dynamics,
perhaps a person becomes ill from lead in the water, etc
likewise, leafy greens in a salad as circuitry, food, and
meat, say from a cow, as this relates to how ingredients
used for daily diets effect and are effected by a larger
circuit, of self though also of groups of people, the state
they together compose, and the environment itself as a
part of this relationship, dynamic, in existing dimensions;
how these are or are not accounted for, then, precluding
what is tallied or 'acknowledged' and in what ways, else
denied, say chemicals on plants that promote cancer
via homeopathic approach, poisoning via 1,000 disease
vectors to eventually hit the genocide jackpot over time;
so too, raising cattle in debilitating conditions, injecting
with hormones to negatively effect humans down range,
eating spiked levels of animal stress and pain as circuit,
perhaps losing nutrition though gaining the amplification
of similar disease promotion via chemical absorption
into cells, their malfunctioning, all part of the plan
this as circuitry, toxic ecosystem functioning against
LIFE, devolving humans to livestock yet vegetable and
eventually robots via very same ideology of technique
removed of higher truth than what is politically allowed,
thus allowing social, behavorial, mental-engineering to
head towards this as if nirvana, 'enlightened following'
where greatest capacity is equated with end of cycle
of existence, by way of extinction of human 'species';
and it is legislated no less. how stupid do people have
to be to go along with it, especially unthinkingly, without
resistance or taking it on as a situation... why is there
an absence of intelligence in dealing with the basics
here, why the gap? perhaps everyone is stoned and
playing games on their fucking iphones, using PGP
to complain about how crooked things are, IDFK
and yet enlightened, opinionated, at same time helpless,
pathetic, yet self-righteous as if superior awareness or
knowing while incapacitated and unwilling to take the
leap into the maw of death enough to trust greater truth,
that the purpose is much larger than any person and that
an infrastructure exist, nature itself, to remedy this situation
beyond all the lies, and yet there is lack of faith or belief--
in truth. in logic. in reality beyond a limited warped view
reliant on relativism, the lies and betrayals of education
becoming commonplace as viewpoint, turned against self,
people cannot even trust their own minds, so thoroughly
mistaken and beholden to external validation of what is
so basically, the individual is fucked. the shared set of
people absolutely absent from engaging the situation in
the terms it exists, beyond the self and small groups
that still can rely upon and benefit from the bullshit factor
and various other limits, impeding larger ecosystem truth,
being that is beyond existing boundaries or misconceptions
then it is a time of count of be counted, who is awake
and who is aware and who serves truth and is willing to
make sacrifices and who are those doing it already and
how is this all connected in a larger structural framework,
as it relates individual awareness in varying dimensions with
others, molecular processing of interconnected consciousness
and where does mind meet its embodiment, deeds, not only
words, and at what scale or what limitation, what amount of
self-serving bullshit and privilege versus sacrifice, losing the
egostic framework that requires its own safety to persist,
disconnection from suffering as if above, instead corrupted
and serving self firstly and projecting this outward to others;
unaccounted for, how much betrayed by the psycho-logical,
a great many tells exist for parameters that remain para-
and thus insight can tend towards involution, yet warped
and ungrounded, as if superior knowing when actually less
thus is the nature of the egotist who believes because of
station to know everything, even though wrongly, while
mocking another who thinks they know something, as if
that is the arrogance and an impossible, due to superiority
on these themes then, there are people who journey into
a realm of drugs and document their research, such as
ethnobotanist Terrance McKenna, [5] and this tends also
towards Thompson-Leary cryptography, [6] in that it is not
only the signaling of plants themselves though their effects
within people and culture, which extends this signaling at
human scale and in human dynamics and ecosystems,
that could be sacred or profane, given implementation
though perhaps also more than this: toxic and poison
exists and being able to absorb it can deteriorate not
enhance in the ways believed as if all is transcendent,
or like climbing mountains, leads to heights not depths;
(if living in an inverted world, things may be backwards)
(note here: as with crystals and piezo-sensors as organic
or natural circuitry, the chemical compounds and circuitry
of drugs, both those defined legal and illegal [7][8], as it
relates to how that circuitry, visualized, may correlate with
certain dimensions and parameters of its effects, in that
the different visual structure maps to different systems in
the body and mind, different ecosystems or dynamics.
thus, like a custom programmed IC or microcontroller,
so too Aspirin or Ambien or Acid or patterns delivered.
in other words: where's the message, what is the key,
where is the information, what is encrypted, how is this
circuitry, how does it map, metabolize, transform and
change, positive and negative dynamics, feedback...
and not to forget, all of this as language, its calculus)
principles and intelligence related to horticulture, then,
Luther Burbank's work The Training of the Human Plant
[9] as this could relate to culture, cultivation, the cultic
imagination and manifestation, of ideas and of ideology
if raising the vegetable as higher consciousness and
becoming one with nature, it could also involve loss of
certain critical facilities or awareness in turn, and this
could be a danger for a way of being that no longer is
human, or no longer serves a higher truth than what is
accessed immediately and in proximity to the body
in terms of its likes and agreements and hospitalities,
and a movement away from truth or regression could
occur, and thinking could be turned against itself so
that the lower is again the higher, people in service
to something that is less intelligent, though in this
way, combining with the circuit, ecosystem, fusing
and then becoming vegetable, animal. in terms of
rites-of-passage, this may be inherent, as with an
embryological view of reptile, mammalian sections
of brain as it develops, old brain and new, and yet,
to then situate a self in a limiting framework and
obey its constraints could also be to decouple
from the natural world for an illusion replacing it,
a false consciousness believed as if higher truth
here be witchcraft and paganism and other forms,
cannibalism and other practices likewise that can
operate in such physics though also in exploitation
not recognize or serve other truths, this danger of
losing the human, turning to falsity as power. and
thus 'humans as plants' turns to 'plants as human'
and another framework of ethics, morality, judgement
and ways of being potentially aligned in other terms
thus people occupy these realms, some witchcraft
dark and serving against truth, while others good
and using knowledge of nature and its metaphysics
for life, healing, medicine, the paradoxical condition,
the Caduceus [10] and Rod of Asclepius [11], their
dual-role of sickness and health, the importance of
being able to recognize its value and not outlaw it,
the truth involved, yet to do so accurately, clearly,
accounting for actual conditions and not ideological,
which then infects minds, corrupts intelligence, etc
(a double-dealing War of Drugs that is a hypocritical
onesided takedown of political enemies forbids this
yet exploits the condition to retain silence, or else
the NSA will ruin your life and quicken extinction.
this is how evil gets a foothold in society, becoming
governance, people obeying and serving this falsity)
so, what say you to worshiping mandrake root? [12]
"i'm up for it, do you have coke to go along with it?"
perhaps tending to profane here... people becoming this
drug, its deliverance as plague even, as consciousness
that is skewed and distorted and worms its way further
into culture via principles aligned with toxic dynamics,
becoming ecosystem, way of being turns to nothingness.
the void, a mirror-image of knowing that is actually false,
ungrounded in its symmetrical belief, incorrectly aligned
with events yet not accounting for structural aberrations
and therefore ignorance a basis of such supreme belief,
as if above it all, operating in a realm of higher awareness
when instead a conceit that does not correlate with reality
and eventually, to be accounted for in cosmic ecosystem
what this is to suggest is that, people becoming plants
is a devolutionary process, a regression of intellectual
capacity that returns to feeling-based diagnostics that
can be localized out of other dimensional frameworks
that were once connected, coherent, and correlated
as lies and falsity are normalized, toxic poison of mind
that is shared amongst many can, like invasive species
overtake localities, growing and thriving in place of the
natural habitat, with devastating consequence for the
prospects of life on terms against the ecosystem, or
ecosystem engineered to be against sustaining of life,
these destructive principles of death and hate, turning
people into lower lifeforms, humans as subhumans, as
if only apes or less than this even, judged, sentenced
to death via this insane and evil ideology, this artifice,
unaligned, disconnected, hostile to nature, life, love
then it should be mentioned- turning this into religion...
use of what seems to be a multimeter to diagnose the
human in its electromagnetic circuitry, as lying plant,
though to question Scientology methodology, if this
fever graph is mapping of galvonic skin response or
perhaps 'information' in its vibrational context, as the
circuits would be different, and perhaps another layer
or boundary of interpretation exists between these, in
that non-acoustic acoustic phenomena could be judged
as acoustic, or non-acoustic as electromagnetic yet the
circuits evaluated could be too simple for what is involved
and thus the problem of thinking, of logic and reasoning
in relativistic frameworks that could tend towards rule
of behaviorism _over mind, over higher awareness and
in this way- the rule of language over people, so that
ideas must conform to a given rationalization, ideology
that can be wrong-headed or wrong-minded or of wrong
or inaccurate beliefs yet unchecked as ecosystem and
in this way, mislead or rely on certain 'limited knowing'
versus actual understanding or comprehension beyond
a given faulty framework, where short-circuiting could
be the key to health and not just sickness, correcting
every anomaly leading to forced silencing, versus the
role of sensors, the diagnostic evaluation, clues that
map out circuitry yet not necessarily in their entirety,
the mystery much larger than any parts combined,
when disconnected from ecosystem as if controlled;
the false consciousness default if methodologically
forcing such truth, grounding to the false all too easy,
perhaps the main sickness of institutions over time,
corruption from reliance on ideas divorced from truth
beyond narrowed limits, losing self-awareness while
representing it as if pillar or structure, foundation for
others, symbolic, yet still potentially ungrounded,
the problem of being blinded from believing to know
and yet in this belief, forbidding such awareness
in other words, once again, attaining grounding in
an unnatural or toxic habitat, as this potentially can
relate to lies or falsity, and then 'enlightenment' by
the normalization of this ecosystem relation that
can function in negative, hostile, immoral relations
and dynamics for food, survival, shelter, knowledge,
then going on to represent and replace culture that
was to serve life and now is about serving death and
a certain range of parameters, dimensions, dynamics
that are 'healthy' and 'good' for this diseased condition
and its state of being that is centered on nothingness,
no higher goals than the base and material exploitation
crypto in this context, signaling, as patterns and signs,
symbols and their processing, relations based on these,
correlation between circuitries, issues of competing biomes
and ecosystems, different if hidden ecosystems, ecologies,
different mechanisms and dynamics, as this maps onto
forms, artifacts, events, to be read/written as language,
the correlation of dimensions, shared or unshared, like
or unlike, those who are vegetable-like feeling-based if
not connected with the false world and the oppression,
versus those thinking beyond, into/from other principles-
all of it as circuitry, consciousness, signaling, codes,
crypto, messaging and communications, protocols,
layers, habitat, food, poison/medicine, culture, flow
what is the greater consciousness of the false order?
perhaps the shared lie as it maps to realms of artifice
what is the greater consciousness of truth?
perhaps shared being in the world, truth, live, love
in this way, two entities and existences, information
and its circuits grounding either to truth or to falsity
(the paradox: never beyond a realm of good and evil)

@_author: brian carroll 
@_subject: blackflag operations 
at a certain point in my independent research it was
realized that the US flag itself represented the existing
problem encountered with ideology and rule-following
that automatically functions against core principles,
such that 'the stars' were of false constellations and
'the stripes' were more those of prison bars, to hold
the population captive inside a hierarchical top-down
structure, which i equate with a conceptualization in
Networks of Power, of system, order, and control [1]
as it determines economic, social, political dynamics.
thus the US flag, its symbolism, is part of the problem
in terms of its rigid adherence, especially in a realm of
patriotism and xenophobia, such that it appears to deign
reasonable the US as world empire without questioning
its own failures or correcting for them, only extending it
further outward, which then serves policies the hidden
US dictatorship perfectly, as long as silence is upheld
and no communication is possible about these issues.
(that is, in terms of reasoning of empirical truth as this
would be observed by the law as the basis for power,
versus making the constitution a relativistic document
interpreted via power determining what the signs mean)
in this way, so too the powerplant and grid of development
that underlines present-day civilization, a centralized and
hidden realm of top-down power and control governed by
private interests said to function on behalf of the public,
yet with little evidence of this within ruins of the planet.
in other words: power delivery is related to governance.
and how power flows in one-direction and 'represents'
certain goals and ideals that do not map into the local
issues or shared values beyond a certain framework or
mindset that makes monetary profit is greatest truth.
and yet truth does not work this way. which is to say,
it is not invalidated by ignoring or censoring it out of
existence within these domains, it still exists though
is isolated, disconnected, and thus loses its power
via a false-worldview that takes its place via lies and
deception, a shared illusion that is ungrounded yet
sustained in a bubble, antihuman in word and deed.
in terms of consciousness, much of this is known
and experienced day to day, life to life, yet remains
uncommunicable due to the loss of language, the
absence of connection in realistic terms, about this
inhuman condition, the center of civilization becoming
that of nothingness, of lost souls at the core of it, this
essential vacancy of meaning, devaluing of knowledge
beyond what interests and benefits those in authority,
and thus a seemingly irrational situation exists and is
mediated, one by one, that does not add up nor does
it make any sense, part to whole, because all is left
is fragmented and misaligned, dumbed down, warped
and skewed such that a hall of fun-house mirrors is
the limit to daily reflection in status quo relations, as
nothing more can be said than some finite limit where
the basic situation cannot even be acknowledged, so
hostile is the background and near-field effects, that
any error or wrong thought could jeopardize survival
and force a person into exile or worse, via all-seeing
accountants for conformity, verifying and making sure
the brain washing is effective, all remain followers of
the ideological framework, staying within its confines
and so knowing is disconnected for saying or even
thinking, people detached from themselves and others
and then to awake and find oneself situated in this way;
essentially without being, without access to their own
true nature or capacity or abilities, instead neutered
by what is now convention, via subversion, deception
electromagnetism as the context for the US flag then
recontextualizes some questions of vexillology [2], in
that evaluating the symbolic structure of the flag in its
relation to electrical infrastructure as a system of power
that extends beyond electricity into issues of politics of
the state, including waging of war for natural resources,
and likewise systems based on this ordering, visualized
in urban and rural artifacts of transmission pylons and
distribution poles, then provides further context for the
issues of control - including 'surveillance' in this same
top-down structure, which serves the hierarchy firstly,
to retain its existing historical organization, however
hollowed out and corrupted, used as a false-flag op
in thinking through issues of endless war in the
Middle East and the nonsensical War of Error as it
relates to failure of ideas to govern state actions and
instead submission to faith in leadership and hidden
policies and political agendas, antihuman in ideology
and nature, due to their inaccuracy, loss of capacity
in thinking and language that then functions against
citizens and life, instead of on behalf of these -- this
situation then becoming 'source code' and program
based on flawed and wrong-minded processing of
actions, using, relying upon, exploiting loopholes
in the US constitution as basis for what is possible,
this becoming morality and ethics and its own truth,
the danger of action being untethered from grounded
reasoning and instead FAITH-BASED in ideology of
rightness, with no remaining checks and balances
after the orchestrated power grab, post-coup (41)
in which the state is opposed to truth that does not
serve and submit to this hidden agenda as highest
what have you then, as a citizen in this situation,
do you benefit or are your days numbered as you
wait, channeled into the correct chutes for awaiting
cattle cars, death panels and Obamacare first steps
enough is enough, sanity must regain its place, and
reason based in grounded truth must be secured for
anything other than this automatic decline to continue
into a realm of pure hate and unrestrained evil, driven
by the state in its godless construction and operation
in this way, US Blackflag operations were called for
to regain control over the state and its actions via
an emergency measure built into the constitution that
allows a constitutional convention to be called if or when
the state goes off course due to legal guidelines once written
yet which function against the very principles they stand for
and thus, to raise the Blackflag as the symbol and sign of
this human citizen, to reclaim control over the shared state
and its governance, and remove the existing US flag from its
role as oppressor of its own and other populations, in that
the truth of the US Constitution has become decoupled from
its accounting in logic, beyond that of shared opinion within
language (sign=sign based pattern matching), such that the
views 'believed' are ideological, based and reliant upon ever
shifting relativism that maps to motives of power & authority
over this process of interpretation, as institutionalized, this
the very structure of society, politics, economics, yet within
a bubble view that cannot be falsified, contested, debated
even (see: closed, onesided mass media), and this as the
authority, the 'mind' at the top of the machinery, that sees
and observes everything in this warped, unreal self-serving
viewpoint, that what is good for it is the best for everybody,
any number of rationalizations reinforcing this viewpoint,
and yet no error correction anywhere allowed, especially
in a legal context, because truth itself has been outlawed
thus the ability to critique or correct the malfunctioning of
the state is an impossibility, given the loss of reasoning
that no longer relies upon empirical truth for verification
and validation of processes, and instead 'shared belief'
and a 'superior knowing' takes this place, without anchor
to truth outside a binary simplism, yet beyond correction
for its errors, because they can be ignored, denied, and
the other side destroyed, as is necessitated ideologically;
one side must lose for the other side to win, these "rules"
blackflag would counter this coup and takeover of the state
by a hostile invading population by regaining legal control
over its decision-making and accounting for events in terms
of accountable truth, not allowing secrecy and privilege to
stand-in for assurances of 'good intentions' underneath it all,
at the same time those opposed to institutionalized criminality
are being weeded out of civilization one by one, via surveillance
and attacks against basic existence and subsistence, those
of the traitorous state having been empowered by the takeover
to go the next step, the purging of dissenters and dissidents,
of any who threaten their agenda, privatizing the public realm
and denying services to those not of their shared demographic
in this way, so too, US taxes serving this group primarily as
others go without or are attacked by these same services,
health care becoming administering of disease and death,
social services to increase helplessness and incapacitation,
maximizing profits while engineering conditions impossible
to survive, thus crushing the life out of those at the bottom
and making each year more difficult than the last, death as
if a gift, it cannot arrive early enough, genocide as if mercy
my first attempt at conveying these ideas was to recolor the
US flag as all black while retaining its stars and stripes as
the structure[3]. the problem with this was that it revealed
the ideological formatting of the state, in its rigid lines and
ordering that are the manifestation of this corruption of the
historic compact between individuals & larger organization,
and how governance at the top requires imprisoning those
below, as part of the warped structural dynamics relied upon
and thus injustice built-into the system, its foundation, this
notably in 'mankind' as the shared identity, this privatized
viewpoint scaled to the public allowing any individual to act
in pure selfishness without regard or responsibility to others-
this enshrined in law, outdated as viewpoint, 'the public' does
not exist in this state beyond an 18 century notion, and this
is exactly how this corruption is allowed operate today, by
not acknowledging this condition and correcting it in law-
which requires logic, 3-value and N-value logic, to prove
the binarist viewpoint wrong though also immoral, illegal,
unethical, and yet this very 'reasoning' is forbidden today.
i began to sew, having a black nylon technical fabric,
the goal being to generate a more accurate structure for
the flag that would reflect or in some way represent the
actual dynamics of truth within society, these ideals and
principles of the US constitution in a shared human context,
where both men and women are equal as citizens, and that
people operate in different conditions yet function together
as part of a larger dynamic, an ecosystem that becomes
the state via a decentralized and distributed organization,
scaling from local to national if global contexts, conditions,
situations, aligned via shared dimensions, truth as value
the flag that resulted [4] has a slightly different symbology.
there are many stars, points of light, though some of these
become larger stars via their connected patterning (that is,
points connect or scale up into larger star structures, and
some may be separated at any moment & other combined)
the goal was to demonstrate that constellations of people
or ideas can form, amongst points of individuals, organize
into patterned structures that form a basis for shared order,
and while in the photograph of the flag it is not visible, there
are various regions or boundaries for these relations/events,
where some of these points and stars exist within the same
limits and others exist beyond or outside a given threshold.
(there were additional close-up photos though i do not have
most any of my work archived, though the language of the
zigzag stitching defined these various regional boundaries,
that then translates into near or far within larger ecosystem)
add to this then the linking or networking of these 'stars',
that for me are based on the butterfly paper clamp and also
on the star as a high-voltage transmission pylon or tower, in
this way, structural interconnections can be conceptualized
as -p-o-w-e-r-l-i-n-e-s- and also as the invisible lines that link
together constellations invisibility mapping out the night sky
as stars and structures relate, and capture or model meaning,
to include helping with navigation, awareness, and worldview
in this sense pattern recognition is structural, foundational,
and connections and relations between people in shared truth
is this larger empirical awareness, emerging from relativistic
scenarios, as truth is aligned amongst people and related to
and through, in changing dynamics, shared state as circuitry
and information processor, logical reasoning and organization,
this _ground-up leveling of awareness, ideas, intent, action,
virtue, truth, justice, development, higher purpose, ideals
in this way, so too, power delivery, locally to regionally and
how it scales based upon its shared relation with truth and
those who serve it, as this contrasts with the US flag and
its institutionalization where such dynamics are disallowed,
and people are silenced in these relations, truth vanquished,
something else taking hold, terrorizing citizens in its place
this call for the blackflag to rise and replace the corrupt
US government by legal means, regaining control of the
failed state via constitutional right, then is a challenge to
the reigning falsity that rules and politically 'governs', using
its power against citizens to secure its power indefinitely,
relying on illegal means and methods beyond accountability
due to secrecy and privacy that only applies to oppressors,
while such protections are removed for enemies and used
to exploit and force the downfall of those who live here
the language then may become shared, that yes, such
high insanity must be acknowledged and thus the charade
can be further extended to allow continuing control as these
subversive others continue to attempt to control the reins of
state action, at any cost. and thus mimicry could exist that
seeks to 'represent' this cause via a traditional mindset that
is corrupted by ideology and "believes" something other than
what is said, serves some unacknowledged agenda or view,
that is only camouflaged by the flag, and thus is assumed
to retain control, whatever the shifting dynamics by relying
on the same structures to persist, whatever the new color
in this way, the blackflag yet another false flag for these
traitors who would exist alongside those involved, grounded
within this structural awareness of truth, its transparent and
logical accounting beyond skewed binary onesidedness. a
realm of imposters, mimics, cheats and frauds thus would
continue and yet to juxtapose, compare and contrast these
dynamics, it should be clear that 'the rationale' is entirely
different for these two flags [5], they are not the same idea,
and do not sustain the same beliefs, principles, or ordering
they are actually set against one another in this very moment,
as changes begin to be wrought and pressures exist that still
constrain such actions, based upon resistance, power and
authority based on forbidding what is best for human citizenry
the ideological grid of the present is a cage, a prison camp
purpose-built for human holocaust whereby truth is denied
and eventually outlawed, nonexistence as the present day,
people trapped and existing inside an illusion, not living, only
trying to sustain themselves, keep breathing in the cemetery
in this condition, this separation into many, the individual parts
begin communicating, realize connections in grounded truth
that establish this empirical framework needed, and it involves
taking down the walls built by the state, its prison bar stripes
and false-stars and false-constellations based on emulation,
the state as hollywood movie production, leaders as actors
playing a role on the world stage, versus addressing issues
that exist and being held accountable for such 'representation'
driven by taxation that grows this machinery while seeking to
extinguish citizens inside who do not obey or are the enemy
of those with power. that is what can be seen within various
signs and symbols, language, calculus, patterns & geometry
the difference between these flags is the difference between
ideas and ideology, shared truth versus shared falsity and lies,
freedom versus imprisonment, responsibility versus greed and
unfettered selfishness, duty in opposition to vanity and frivolity,
the network versus the grid, being vs. nothingness, humanity
versus antihumans, individuals vs. institutions, democracy of
human citizens versus corporate democracy, empirical reality
versus relativistic madness, and philosophy versus psychiatry
the existing US flag is the embodiment of politics that replace
the truth with its antithesis which becomes a basis for power,
the blackflag is all about governance, between people who
create and compose the larger state via empirical reasoning
that is based in truth, accounted for and error corrected by
logic, and held accountable and required to change, improve
its functioning, not given the right to ignore its obligations to
people, life, nature, and the larger order it is situated within
the delivery of power will one day arrive, deliverance from this
corrupted condition, within a organized coherent agenda that
regains control over this automated machinery serving wrong
principles and wrong ideas and wrong thinking and beliefs.
there are two orders, represented by these flags. one of
them is aligned with falsity and serves it for its own benefit.
the other serves truth, firstly and wholeheartedly. it is about
how the constitution of a person aligns with those around them
and how this scales and relates and is represented by the state.
the false have their flag. recoloring it is not going to change
anything structural, which is required for the oppression and
exploitation to continue. it can only and must be destroyed as
an institutionalized structure to regain control over the failed state,
as the US constitution outlines and allows. the nature of truth is
conceptualized in the other flag, its blackness has depth and
grounding in principles that reflect those of its people and those
who sacrifice and serve, for greater truth and higher principles
than the base and monetary as if the meaning of life eternal
in other words, no longer will the body govern over the mind,
no longer will the grid determine the network, nor ideology
the truth of ideas. and indeed there is a binary condition
that exists in this situation- between truth and pseudo-truth,
where actual truth grounds to 1 and pseudo-truth to falsity (0).
in this way there is only one value, it is truth. all or nothing.
the US state needs to be brought under constitutional control,
destroy the existing dictatorship, and draft a new constitution
i for one stand against the ongoing criminality of the state
and vote the military take control of its functioning to secure
its actions from those hostile to human citizens and our future

@_subject: conceptual theatre 
in times like these you might expect there would be
music about what is going on, films investigating the
concepts (many quite good actually), other activities,
painters painting (a few) and so on, to establish depth
to conversation and communication instead of enforcing
ideological limits and functioning in limited parameters,
reinforcing traditional feedback loops corruption relies upon
especially plays, literature. perhaps some of the latter in
its detachment or documentary aspects or parallels yet
where is the cultural insight of those most free on earth-
why the silence when searching for 'play on surveillance'
that would have theater delving into realm of importance
and providing critique, frameworks to evaluate ongoing
situations within, instead of- well, seemingly nothing.
- of - the - most - free - people - in - the - entire - world -
with nothing to say or views to share about this situation,
not using their rights or freedoms -- adding up to nothing
fucking disgraceful. shameful, self-indulgent, self serving
hypocrisy. as if bureaucracy must sign off on everything.
no allowable risk. disneyification of the entirety of culture,
endless reruns of previous ideas and interpretations yet
no one with enough insight to frame this given picture?
or is it fear that holds people back, silence is safety
no one willing to take a stab at it, and then another
to regain a space and place lost to complacency and
lack of will, responsibility, greater purpose than money
certainly playwrights of the past would have engaged,
though what about direct engagement, for understanding
to model the situation and evaluate it as only theater
can do, to create other atmospheres that capture these
situations and make what is ineffable due to abstractness
tangible, realized, understood, and relatable through use
of actors and storytelling and stage and props, scenery
my contribution to this, as a structural idea for plays
about surveillance society, free for use as a concept:
that a stage with one person, at other times two people
(or more) could exist as if on a basketball court, whereby
bleachers would exist on either side of the main area
1) this could involve a central stage with two bleacher wings,
splayed out facing an audience as if vanishing perspective
2) else it could be an actual school gymnasium with large
bleachers where a theatric performance takes place
see: concept for stage design and structure for play
here is the idea. people in the bleachers are surveillers,
they may either sit on the sidelines, and then aspects of
the play could move in parallel in these other dimensions
(geospatial, store tracking, license scanning, credit card
history, database mining and advertising, listening to calls
and keyword mapping, metadata, tracking receipts, etc)
in version 1 (above) they would then be functioning the
_background, otherwise invisible to the people in the center
of their daily lives, behind this hidden threshold of rules, laws,
language that forbids understanding of this condition at the
same time it defines the existence and actions of the people
warping or skew of data, the hypocrisy of tracking details by
companies or reselling of data, public-private profit strategies,
extortion, blackmail, political abuse, marketing, web adverts,
social network mapping, any of this commentary introduced
into this position of the actors at center stage as they relate
with others, such as using the phone or a computer, as this
links to people or topics, 'feedback' as various events occur
in version 2 (above) the same dynamics could occur though
with plants in the audience, sitting amongst others in the
bleachers, perhaps people wearing all black suits, dark
glasses, holding strange equipment, and instructions for
those in the bleachers to relay messages (the telephone
game) where a signal is passed along regular routes and
thus input is transformed by output, then passing this data
back into the play, as improvisation. for instance, a "secret"
could be passed into the bleachers by an informant, and
then by a defined route, 10 or 15 people in a given line or
sequence (marked by graphics) could be part of this flow
of data, having to relay what they heard one to the next,
to get the data to the black suited mystery people, and
thus the message they receive is then output as signal
back into the play, to those center stage or others who
are inacting with it, such that 'traveling to sign-ville' then
becomes 'unraveling the dollar bill' when later output, etc
thus, this kind of conceptual format would allow creative
expression and exploration of issues, perhaps it would
be best and most informed by technical consultation
with privacy or security and-or other experts, including
data from those surveilled, such that a larger sense of
what this involves could be sketched for citizens so that
its impact and importance could be gauged in a context
of daily living, to what extent this data gathering and this
tracking and watching is going on, and what principles it
is currently be driven by and how laws do not exist that
can constrain its functioning against citizens day to day,
and that everyday situations involve these dimensions
and issues of privacy, security, and such exploitations
playwrights have the unique skills to convey such
cultural messages and raise consciousness, and do it
in a memorable and intriguing and innovative way. where
is the equivalent of the Snowden of playwrights, perhaps
such a format could be reinterpreted by a dozen or more
playwrights, from varying angels or degrees or settings.
what if the structure is modular, and can add, subtract,
or modify the ideas of other plays using this structure,
and thus open or free source the play for interpretative
exploration and development. it is the information and
the perspective that is important, the truth of what is
going on. theaters are places for living ideas, not the
continual regurgitation of those dead and lifeless as if
highest value or truth. there is missing data of today,
who is willing to approach to present and convey what
it involves, using all the resources available to transmit
important information and ideas, start and sustain the
conversation beyond its existing, stifling boundaries
freedom does not exist if it is not made use of. and
it goes away if seeking permission to do something,
because somewhere along the line it may involve risk.
but isn't it worth trying to do something and seeing what
the real situation is, and then knowing from that, then to
not even try, not even do anything, and supposed to know
by not taking it on, accepting defeat without ever fighting
there have got to be some playwrights willing to take
on these issues. if they exist, hopefully so, it would be
interesting to see what such plays involve in their content
and approaches to conveying and conceptualizing issues
of cyberspace, hacking, surveillance, attacks, and so on

preexisting television comedy could be thus be recontextualized and

attackers stealing pins via hidden

cash register. likewise, make a phone call and the surveillers light up
with commentary about what is going on, adding depth and counterpoint and
absurdity into the illusion of the 'secure' context, presented as if normal
and everyday. in this way, a theater approach could exist via such
conceptual structure and provide a format to explore such ideas via
advanced viewpoints and perspectives otherwise lacking or absent in their
parallelism, as situations coexist in simultaneous, interacting hidden
these dynamics and relations then, thresholds, boundaries, identity and
awareness, as it relates to what is and is not observed, near and far, and
how it is all put together or people remain oblivious to the context of

a few observations related to the video presentation:
1) often hear issues about legitimacy of mass surveillance in relation to
'targeted surveillance' as delineator, whereby legitimate targeting is
afforded to actual threats to the state and its required security measures
that likely involves way more in the realm of reasoning and undocumented
information than people are aware of, to determine whether or not a threat
exists and if such measures are necessary in terms of state security.
thus, surveilling of individuals who are problematic (either as actual foes
- aka terrorists, dangerous criminals, spies - or those wrongly-categorized
though falling into this same catch-all category) yet where oversight or
high fidelity review may not exist and thus reasoning may be weak for who
is targeted along with those who are legitimate threats.
meaning: in the talk the group or category of 'Muslims' were mentioned as
surveillance targets, though perhaps not all of these, yet in relation to
profiling, it would suggest mass surveillance could exist in certain
communities moreso than in others. in that the individual scales into a
group target, the weighting of probability perhaps moving higher in certain
demographic characteristics shared as part of a threat model outline. so
too, activists against business interests and so on, depending upon how
privatized the surveillance model is, what it is being used for, how it is
leveraged for political agendas, etc.
and so oftentimes in the mainstream viewpoint it tends to be that the
targets that tend towards some fraction of 1% of the population are likely
legitimate targets (say, 0.00001%) so that, as an example, a US population
of 314 million people has around 3,139 actual threats that would justify
surveillance measures in terms of their violent activities that threaten to
undermine the state or pursue terrorist actions against the population
(unless false flag engineered, etc).
and here is my contention with this view, and how a category such as
'ethnicity' or 'religion' may indicate there are other potential dynamics
that legitimate mass surveillance, and so it may be a fallacy to uphold
this perspective, that only some fraction of 1% are justifiable for
targeted surveillance and not dragnets over the entire population--
because, what if instead the threat involves an invading force, an
occupation, where the opponent tends towards 30% to more than 50% or more,
so that it could be 150 million people and those they are related to that
require tracking and further analysis. and that this is the more likely
threat model, in certain scenarios, depending on how it is calculated. and
could also exist as a paradox, where 'both sides' use the same or similar
surveillance to track opponents, though with different ends such that the
NSA is not a monolithic ideological organization and could be involved in a
deception campaign whereby there is a 'sandbox' for a pretend-NSA operating
as if the NSA, inside the larger organization and this is the context for
issues of who is surveilled, how surveillance is occurring, state- and
world-level honey traps, bear traps, monster traps, and so on.
in plain sight i think there are conditions of a civil war at world scale
and this is the threat model, and there is rotten surveillance that is
driven by the corrupt state, and a surrogate or pretend-NSA at the helm,
itself corrupted yet also contained, and then another threat model that is
monitoring all of this activity via surveillance at the scale of 50% or
greater of the population, in great and intricate detail, that remains
legitimate. and so, a vast forward strategy yet that is invisible, and a
smaller corrupt forward strategy that will be made visible in its
corruption. (set(subset)) dynamics.
in that this complex approach maps to military strategy of the early into
late 20th century, including the aftermath of WWII and politics of Vietnam
war in cultural terms extended into the present, and in terms of
{superset}, millennia of strategic planning likewise, setting up a false
order in order to take it down in an open-source context of Armageddon.
2) it seems bizarre that NSA activities are confined to computer technology
and there is yet no mention of behavioral dimensions to hacking, including
neurological attacks using em tools and weaponry. in that psychologists,
neurologists, psychiatrists and others vital information to hacking people
who are targeted, to program or force into disrepair. for instance, certain
chemicals can enter into the body via food supply and then be triggered via
signals and electromagnetic fields, activating them via remote switch.
chemicals in food supply then like junk dna that allows such custom
targeting at a distance, say via hostile management of infrastructure,
beyond normal rules, boundaries. the realm of mindwarfare and psychological
war, information operations at the covert level _must be tied to this same
NSA infrastructure manipulation if existing and attacking populations, yet
why is it disregarded as part of this context, why is the very direct
connection between EM tech and EM human physiology disregarded a priori as
an attack vector and not dealt with in the human rights context it should
exist within by default, if made readily aware that such dynamics are
inherent- not anomaly - to this aggressive surveillance, goals of behavior
modification, etc.
3) this leads to the issue of how this technology is fielded. if it exists,
the quickest and most distribributed, efficient route for an eight-mile
distant attack would be the cellular tower infrastructure that already
exists. that would turn it from a manual operation with field agents on
site or locally, to an issue of remote administration of these tools and
their automation, such that any person (tending towards 50% of population
model, say) could be attacked, and that it is not a tiny fraction and
instead every single device that could be scaled to the highest threat
model as need be, and thus whatever tools exist to do this would need to
exist in a context of mass surveillance, not individual cases that are few
and far between, because if that is not the nature of the actual threat,
why would tools be restricted in their use to a less-than-necessary
deployment. and thus automated infrastructure deployment seems probable in
this regard.
4) in this way, so too, neurological weaponry and behavior modification
hacking tools would likely coexist in a similar context if deployed and in
use, much more serious than attacking inert tools and equipment. attacking
peoples - citizens - nervous systems and minds, driving people into ill
health or conditions of psychological/physiological torture via these same
technical means, perhaps a sub-branch of NSA or co-use via CIA special
programs or other military venture, yet hostile to citizenry, operating in
a faulty or infallible threat model, exploited by onesided politics of
hidden  dictatorship and so on. that level of realism does not yet exist
though certainly some measure of these hostile tools exist hidden within
the same infrastructure - deployed and leveraged by the corrupt overseers,
so when will Snowden or other documents enter into the neurological and
other health aspects of hacking, cracking, pwnage, etc. that is, invisible
death squads sitting like chess pieces on the city grid, awaiting orders to
attack via next hostile moves, &c.

5) another realization upon hearing the 30c3 talk of Jacob Appelbaum
was the 'earth firewall' then indicates that the NSA controls the internet,
and that it is not operating as a subset within it, and instead everything
that occurs is within its domain....
the earlier belief, even in context of Arpanet origins...
    ( "the Internet" (NSA activities) )
when instead, a more realistic scenario in terms of who controls the
technical infrastructure, aka the foundation of cyberspace...
     NSA (the internet)
this makes a world of difference, because then national networks and
technological development occur 'inside' the framework of NSA and it
essentially governs or manages production of equipment, backdoors
installed, and if corrupt, loss of law within that same context that can
and does served warped political goals, attacking political opponents,
dissidents, those against the ruling ideology. technology allowing this.
    NSA (the internet (countrycodes) )
in this way, a corrupt NSA with dictatorial agenda could have established
default control, and enact, develop, extend hidden political organization
via secret or overt manipulations that gain and secure, solidify power yet
which exist beyond law, 'external governance', even within the state itself
    NSA is god, essentially. having rooted earth and its inhabitants.
    // if technical jargon is correct for a non-programmer
   ...and yet does not observe external truth, adhere to or recognize
   shared laws of the state, the US constitution, and other agreements
   that bind the state to its people, in service, versus in exploitation.
in this way, state violence could be automated, mechanized against
populations that somehow believe the NSA is contained and not the
entity doing the containing. like there is an unrecognized role-reversal
by the corrupt entity in a power grab related to hidden, secret US coup

it is my belief that 'context is everything' applies to the review
of these same issues and ideas, especially: location^3
consider issues of mass surveillance and mass deployment
of technical means and measures, for saturation potential so
that getting to the target is a non-issue, zero cost essentially
once installed (the role of infrastructure, resolving such issues
by providing a managed platform that readily automate tasks)
consider 'integrated surveillance' tools and capabilities in a
blackbag context. really think a fleet of a 100 tempest vans
exist in every city, or do the economics work against this as
a scalable approach and require instead cellular towers or
wi-fi antennas as a base for such activities to occur. and if
this were possible, would it not be integrated to N-degrees
of capability? consider electronic door locks in a context of
black bag jobs. what if a remote software command could
more easily unlock a car via cellular tower than a person,
and invisibly, (this prior to them driving you off the road in
autonomous or driverless vehicles, exciting future awaits)
so is psychological warfare and other information operations
by default assumed to involve teams on the ground or is it
potentially seamlessly integrated with existing infrastructure
and streamlined as another protocol layer that can or will be
deployed as or if needed, in terms of threat escalation and
what is legitimated in the given corrupt/illegal approach. if
assuming it involves people going from point A to B there
is little likelihood of these activities being deployed at the
scale of mass surveillance, and yet if infrastructure itself,
there is high likelihood or it is probable that they could be

It seems in practice that there is a relation issue involved in
who judges and determines lawfulness in the shared situation.
oftentimes, the person who judges is actually 'the criminal' and
can "represent the state" and 'the people' though misleadingly,
subverting this relation. such that, a person who exists within
and operates in a criminal way, including relying upon lies as
a day to day framework, then convicts those who may break
one law or tell one lie in their lives or go beyond a boundary
out of principle and larger ethics that question the ruleset
and what happens or appears to is that all the power is with
those who cheat, lie, and steal within the state along with
their accomplices, and that these people 'are the state' that
then judges and determines the fate of otherwise law-abiding
citizens or those who seek to serve its best interests, not least
by enforcing its framework or utilizing its freedoms, testing the
parameters only to find they are not observed, are fiction only
(else, perhaps other more active strategies exist though are
correct in principle, in not adhering to laws that are inaccurate
or overbearing and allow the corruption its continuing power)
what this is to suggest is that the judge-convicted relation is:
    99.99% falsity + 0.01% truth   vs.  99.99% truth + error
(in that the evaluation occurs in a warped framework where
judgement is divorced from its own adherence to truth, via
the same corrupted constitution that allows for this relation)
    99% wrong  ---> judgement ---> 0.01% wrong
and yet this viewpoint (based on power) is itself based upon
LIES and deception, unaccountable to the same rules and
thus is beyond law. and thus it _must show falsity in another
yet never allow this to be accounted for in its own viewpoint
or actions-- which is how authoritarian, totalitarian, and the
secret dictatorship triumph in these conditions, because it
is beyond accountability, it is just about believing in higher
power that is based on lies and opinions, as it filters down
into culture via illiteracy, loss of education, social relations,
normalization of vice, oppression, exploitation, criminality
this is why the state must be abolished, because it has
become thoroughly rotten from the inside out due to the
outdated source code that provides loopholes to oppress
citizens and humans and the planet and animals worldwide
due to loss of truth, and making this lying 'legal' as a basis
for 'shared power' by who shares and is in on the lie, as this
then scales and becomes organization, authority, judgement

that a device simply is plugged into the same site to reveal

just requires smd circuitry add-ons to activate functionality
this could be a stupid-model, versus smart expert systems

span. Now they do.  //...
Kono said superfluorescence is a well-known many-body, or cooperative,
phenomenon in atomic physics. Many-body theory gives physicists a way
to understand how large numbers of interacting particles like
molecules, atoms and electrons behave collectively. Superfluorescence
is one example of how atoms under tight controls collaborate when
triggered by an external source of energy. //...
"The quantum well, as before, consisted of stacked blocks of an indium
gallium arsenide compound separated by barriers of gallium arsenide.
"It's a unique, solid-state environment where many-body effects
completely dominate the dynamics of the system," Kono said.
"When a strong magnetic field is applied, electrons and holes are
fully quantized – that is, constrained in their range of motion—just
like electrons in atoms," he said. "So the essential physics in the
presence of a high magnetic field is quite similar to that in atomic
gases. But as we decrease and eventually eliminate the magnetic field,
we're entering a regime atomic physics cannot access, where continua
of electronic states, or bands, exist." [unquote]

so would this not break the physics model already, of faster than light info,
such that the cosmos may operate on principles beyond those employed.
the comments on the article seemingly indicative of this same scenario,
as if a realm of political science, gerrymandering of physics seemingly.
if a spin could be remotely connected to another, as mentioned in the
article comments, and activated at a distance, could this not function
as a basic switch, perhaps making a relay or gate or some kind or the
ability to send/receive coded messages via morse code (as mentioned).
say, a sequence of spins encoding the alphabet or whatever, perhaps
controlled by a normal computer process yet transmitted/received via
this quantum connectivity (seemingly out of this world then back into it
via vibration, rather than a line of sight acoustic signal, if understanding)
i thought that was the idea underneath the potential for other, hidden
technology embedded in existing systems, that remote relationship
via quantum properties that operate in other dimensionality/structures,
if not beyond lightspeed properties or conceptions, and that it may not
be recognizable in the existing approach or computational paradigm.

organize/emerge out of quantum-noisefield) thus corollary perhaps to the
analogy of water pressure for electrical circuits and flow based on pneuma-
tic dynamics in a potentially bounded or closed system). that may enter
into questions of 'where information actually exists', perhaps stored outside
the brain in noosphere as patterns or forms (invisible constellation/structure)
that is referenced or linked to rather than contained within a brain, and thus
boundary of brain vs. mind. same: digital computer vs.quantum processor,
perhaps. thus issue of channeling or tuning into versus as origin of truth.
what if a fundamentally different data model, thus security model, etc.

@_subject: EM-nature (was: infra-org) 
i need to make note of this observation because it has special
relevance for the present situation of shared observation regarding
'information operations' (or other) that occur and-or are analyzed
within a particular context, framework, conceptualization. because
there is a split in worldview and modeling between the animal realm
whereby the sonar of bats or directional navigation of birds become
detached in their EM abilities from similar non-recognized natural
abilities in humans, which are 'off the map' so to speak, in terms
of a general awareness and recognition of similar EM physiology.
in other words, 'the senses' of humans are detached from their
electromagnetic context that would unify a model of humanity
(to be discussed at some later time) with such EM nature and
provide context for both a healthy relation and toxic conditions.
though this remains unrecognized via a political agenda that
prevents such data beyond its protected ideological boundary,
thus effects of wi-fi or artificial radiation (radio, etc) on human
beings is categorized into a realm of personal 'mental illness'
and unrelated to issues of cancer, at the same time EM tools
(nuclear resonance) are used to treat the ~mystery disease.
it is a split between mind-body that is enforced institutionally,
disallowing EM viewpoint while leveraging its onesidedness
against dumbed-down populations, unable to reason within
the warped frameworks about what is going on, because the
cause and effect have been separated, plausibly denied. in a
context of 'information operations' and 'electronic warfare' this
involves a realm of ~supernatural-like events that thus cannot
be accounted for in a non-electromagnetic context or view,
such that it cannot be 'rationally' reasoned with beyond a
realm of forced hysteria, as if dealing with ghosts/demons,
versus technological infrastructure operating in other realms.
thus security, defense, attacks are in a realm of "beliefs"
that are detached from a shared understanding/knowledge
of the environment these events are operating/occurring within,
like magic or witchcraft or sorcery, exfiltrating data and then
using a god-status to manipulate peoples lives - now this is
the power of government that is beyond oversight, law itself.
entire realms of ideological attackers then can be aligned in
such a ~wildwest scenario as if a replay of cowboys/indians,
the model for basic exchange moves towards highway robbery
in this same approach, detached from the actual condition that
exists, unable to speak about it or confirm it, as with physics
that supposedly "define" reality at the material level yet which
are byzantine and disconnected views that disallow reasoning
and observation while seeking to represent, have control over it
as ideology - this massive obfuscation the success of relativism.
so that nothing and only nothing can be discussed and the left
is rest for experts. in this way, silence is enforced via ideology
that is actually _detached from nature yet claims to represent it
and so to the mind and imagination and body of humans, these
as they are detached from the environment they exist within as
this becomes the basis for exploitation, predator/prey relations
at the level of politics of the rogue state, homicidal government.
in this way little can be said or done without being discredited
for going 'beyond the lines' that are dutifully enforced by the
protectors and defenders of the corrupt ideology, this boundary
is what needs to stand, the misrepresentation and malmodeling
of existence so that _reason cannot occur in accurate terms,
mathematics (of zero) and michelson-morley experiment (as
if simple debunk of aether) and removal of the absolute from
all equations, then acting and believing as if this is NORMAL
when it is fundamentally unreal as to shared experience and
observation of known and knowable facts and observations.
instead it becomes about what is allowed via a viewpoint
that can remain secure while allowing other views to exist,
within certain parameters yet truth is lost in this confinement
to a finite, overcontrolled, self-interested, skewed interaction,
whereby "nothingness" continually replaces "being" as the
shared condition, while those administering technology can
further apply and ply their craft and trade against and upon
humans, while humans have no effect on this relationship,
it is a bias that is enforced by dark ages restrictions upon
thought, held within an outdated view, stagnation of beliefs
for hundreds if not thousands of years of knowledge (basic
amber and lodestone fundamentals continually extended,
technologized) whereby even the fact that the atmosphere
itself is full of charge is irrelevant to those whose interest
is in technology, as if the 'data model' for information only
exists in artificial media and not within EM nature itself,
that beings could be interacting and formatted the shared
environment like the r/w head of a harddrive via mind, yet
the considerations never go outside the skull or beyond
the 'expert models' that bound this to the brain instead.
as if people cannot be allowed to think for themselves
or perhaps know far more than "beliefs" of scientists
allow via its enforcement of a corrupt political ideology,
where this bias against accurate human representation
that gives rise and momentum to an antihuman agenda,
a religious belief system that is biased against humans
as this is turned into infrastructure, tools, government.
and at its core is nothingness. falsity, lies. not truth.
it is language games. it is disregard for, exploitation
of logic whereby proofs are unneeded, never checked-
beyond language in its ungrounded condition and this
very comprehensiveness is itself based on absolutism,
where 'it cannot be known' becomes this absolute truth
simultaneously denied by the same political priesthood
whose goal is to mislead, misdirect, to keep us enslaved
in a false worldview, model, "physics" detached from reality
the disconnection of accurate understanding of the mind,
as if we cannot be allow to think or know consciousness
even, outside the scientific technological evaluation within
a biased modeling, then forbids accurate connection and
evaluation with the electromagnetic body, nervous system,
senses, in terms of awareness, reasoning, truth itself as
it relates to information (and security) beyond 'the brain',
and all the senses in their variability as they are unified
and not kept separate within human and other entities.
yet this wholeness is illegal as an identity, observation
is forcibly denied, the perspective directly challenges
the technical and ideological and political advantage of
those using these warped harmful tools and exploits
against the population, to continue their illegal control
over events to the deterioration of earth, its inhabitants
when truth is outlawed there is no way to 'reason' about
such conditions. they are penalized as viewpoints and
this defines a boundary condition or protected threshold
of different values, economic/political/social interests
that separate, some mind and bodies benefit for this
while others must suffer as a result of ongoing deception.
for some it is their security model, this obfuscated realm.
for others, humans, it is the basis for insecurity, torment,
disconnection for action and ability, realism, truth itself
thus reality is legislated away by others who stand in
for the law, on their own terms, for their own benefit
while others must suffer for this to be sustained, yet
if some take on more suffering via self-sacrifice, this
condition could be fundamentally transformed, given
rules of operation changed, hacked, short-circuited
and switched into other circuits, functionality, and
then the situation becomes increasing interesting

for instance, if the mathematics of zero is off, then use
of such equations reliant on this modeling are going to
bound observations into a realm of perpetual inaccuracy
as a basis for worldview and 'physics' itself
likewise, if politically expedient, within this boundary,
a model of relativism can continually be reinforced via
these mathematics, it further provides a framework that
declares a particular reality to be the shared situation,
even if this goes against common sense, experience,
truth, and knowledge. physics then determining it as
if judge, jury, ultimately executioner of 'bad thinking'
because it does not conform to the inaccurate model
such as astronomers believing goats ruled earth
from the moon or whatever other such beliefs, if
enforced and stopping other direct observations
because they do not conform to the belief system
much more accurate in a charged atmosphere that
we are beings are _submerged in an information
environment, a realm of invisible circuitry that has
fundamental relation to pattern and constellations
of data, models that repeat as concepts and ideas,
and where do these reside, only inside of brains?
this is why the jellyfish seemed a useful analogy,
a floating sentience suspended in an information
rich environment that then is mediated, tuned into,
related to and through within certain dimensionality
that may change from one being, species to the next
and yet some fundamental condition is also shared,
held in common, this is the electromagnetic context
that is _undocumented in both nature and humans
as a continuous circuit throughout the cosmos from
the beginning of its existence to peak development
of life and sentience unfolding at its very edge, that
is where consciousness is operating, alive, interface
to reality and able to reflect upon this condition
yet without a unified model, EM cosmography
necessary before EM cosmology, seemingly, to
consider EM nature in relation to EM lifeforms,
and then EM humans and EM technology within
this realm, as 'consciousness' and concepts like
code, programming, 'artificial intelligence' are
inherently related to this condition in its truth,
yet completely separated from it due to a non-
electromagnetic worldview, understanding, as
if computers invented and 'contain' charge vs.
everything containing charge in a given realm,
plants, animals, the air, tools, bodies, minds.
the circuit itself not even a concept beyond
the manufactured circuitboard in terms of a
diagrammatic approach to reasoning, that is
processing of reality and decision-making,
such that perhaps this too is about circuits,
and we cannot reason or communciate in
the way we actually think, via patterns as
our worldview is disconnected from them,
from our own observation, and made into
signs instead, held apart from geometry,
other structural relations and evaluations
that may predate or provide foundation
for more ornate descriptions thereafter
yet these fundamentals are not secured
and instead lost in a non-EM evaluation,
as if 'writing to write' or 'coding to code' is
a higher connectivity or awareness when
instead it is a further detachment from the
fundamentals, truth in its logical evaluation
needed to secure the modeling, test and
correct for errors, the obligation ignored,
denied for a simple, quicker lost cause,
moving in the wrong direction, forgetting
to listen to the compass built-into the
self, of the electromagnetic directionality,
its connection with this cosmic condition
and the naturalness and unity, harmony
that could exist with people, environment,
tools, instead ignored, disease, disharmony
and falsity taking the place of enlightenment
then to speak of anything detached from this
condition as if encompassing it in a too small,
finite worldview, believing infinity can be pre-
packaged into a confined condition and then
held there as mode of control over it, versus
freeing the infinity truth and human reasoning,
challenging the concepts and regulations of
'discourse' and 'institutionalization of views',
to achieve this greater accuracy, _security
instead becomes the very problem that must
be combated to defend, uphold the criminal
falsity and deception of a false worldview,
false reality, false perspective, false beliefs
that are normalized, enforced, dictated
in this way what is anything in its truth
without this electromagnetic context as
the foundation for its evaluation, and this
in all its dimensionality, not compartmented
into narrowed controlled categories that are
the basis for its denial via social protocols
that seek to uphold a given social order that
does not serve or seek this greater truth and
instead desires to substitute it, stand-in for it,
as guardians though of the false, nothingness
code, crypto in this context, tools, computers,
programming, reasoning, processing, thought,
security, insecurity, tyranny, freedom, laws
how do you move from infinite parallel worlds
in relativistic conditions into a single shared
empirical framework in varying dimensionality
via quantum conditions without EM-nature?
how do you do this if the mathematics do not
allow it. or an absolute framework is not allowed
within reasoning via the ideology of relativism as
it has been detached from logical accounting
beyond the binary onesided belief of ideology.
what if the model of information survives death,
that like energy, if information is attached to it
as pattern in some way, whether morphic fields
or other conceptual forms or formatting, patterns
that even these computer conversations could
already be occurring interdimensionally, beyond

i am completely intrigued and at once baffled by this, wondering
of Code here is referencing code in a wider generic sense or is
restricted to computer coding as the parameters. the examples
given {whistling, baying} seem both in a realm of music/voicing
and movement {gesture} and these all could be contained within
a context of language, seemingly. or perhaps not, as envisaged.
what has me further curious is if this somehow has linguistics
(as crypt.crypto) advantaged to mathematics, as communication
framework in some wider more open or elusive sense, or as the
conception/conceptualization of what code is or may be if crypto
i am still trying to ground with electromagnetic framework thus
imagining beyond this, as if already grounded, more unknowing
of how to even consider such thoughts or considerations as it
difficult or impossible to separate from the medium involved in
my naive and limited awareness and even less understanding
closest to this perhaps in this not-knowing what might be is
that the cosmos itself is encrypted, as a starting point to
questioning, context for developing technical crypt.boxes
then perhaps DNA as encrypted code of life in this framework,
taxonomy of species and disciplines decrypting the patterning,
securing truth key to unlocking the works seemingly, OZ writer
L. Frank Baum naming electromagnetism as the master key,
wondering if it is actually a blank, then what that implies, or if
parameters exist by which it can be made to unlock access
to new dimensions in which this otherness is more tangible,
maybe a realm exists outside of charge, here not the case
at least in the level experienced or encountered, precorpse
in the necropolis, is everything then only "information", etc.

== note on crypto ==
wondering if a distinction could be made in the realm of cryptology as
with other disciplines whereby there is an existing functionality and
then an edge condition of developing ideas where intuitions may be
pursued, tested, learned from.
i see people in various disciplines working on 'ideas' as part of
their work, whereas the same tasks can be pursued in purely
functional, managerial terms likewise, perhaps involving an existing
mode of operation versus evaluating various parameters or potential
in some sense then, as with art, there are artists who have skills and
can develop their work within a given set of parameters, and others
who may be more abstract and involved in this abstraction at the level
of ideas, questioning of existing presumptions. i relate this
condition and pursuit to 'conceptual art', rightly and-or wrongly,
having only an intuitive understanding of what it involves versus art
historical accounts of what it means and how it is identified.
then, so too with music. there are some who perform and develop music
within traditional or known parameters, and others who test or
question the limits though also in a deep realm of ideas. and this
tends towards 'conceptual music' in my sensibility, because more is
involved than what may be discerned from the aesthetics and it may
take more to understand it as it may operate in different parameters
than what is already known, and may need evaluation within a different
sensibility to access what it involves, which may center on grounding
of ideas or conceptions beyond a given interpretation, model, or limit
in standard approaches.
this then relating also to the rich realm of conceptual architecture,
typology seemingly having a unique role in this (ex. architects
Boullée and Ledoux from the enlightenment era when studying ruins and
the discipline of archaeology began, if remembering correctly, moving
into another realm perhaps tending towards the surreal compared to
existing approaches)...
(note: relation of Cenotaph for Newton and nuclear reactor, containing
fission of sun inside building type, significance for evaluating
landscape, environment, meaning, symbolism)
it is as if 'ideas' and their contemplation was more readily at the
center of questioning, the basis for what is developed, less so than
unquestioned conventions repeated as patterns. and this continued as a
major approach, including Le Corbusier and others, within certain
parameters, though a 'high conceptualization' can be involved in an
activity that in the griops of other practitioners is merely a
functional question that has already proscribed solutions that can be
uniquely or methodically rearranged though perhaps not fundamentally
questioned. so in some sense the fundamentals or basis or foundational
and its basics are secured and relied upon or brought into question
and further tested, experimented with, refined, or moved beyond
perhaps in particular circumstances as a model or approach.
this conceptualization continued into the 1960s (such as Archigram)
into the 1980s though its purpose seemed to be made profane, focused
on the image as a basis for abstraction, and the deeper questions of
architecture ignored for a shallow aesthetic approach that can be
hollow or ungrounded from 'reality' in some significant sense,
detached from issues and people and of a realm of CAD design, as if
architecture is only industrial design, creating pleasing objects or
sculpture devoid of economic, social, political, cultural issues it
involves, its deep meaning and insight, and instead, developing
blindness. this is more anti-architecture, the concept is not about
ideas but about extending an ideology of a particular warped value
system, and so the image is like an illusion of what actual
architecture is, in its greater purpose and mission. not trivial, not
just manufacturing buildings or 'culture' as if a fashion item to be
copied, reproduced as a trend or style, yet that is what it has
devolved to in tersm of its 'ideas', in many or most cases- if just on
its detachment from understanding nature itself and people and serving
these interests instead of designing building as part of a
political-economic flow that aestheticizes an existing and harmful way
of life, yet makes it as enticing as possible. (in this way the
excellent observation of such 'architecture' as pornographic forms, as
introduced by Dr. Elisabeth von Samsonow in The Plasticity of the Real
video lecture.)
i tend to consider this earlier intersection between archeology and
architecture vital for understanding both disciplines in their
interrelated depth, bridging past and future, and asking questions
again in a different context than just a present mode of operation.
thus to question and learn from ruins or evaluate a situation in a
larger context than it may otherwise have due to convention. and it
appears a lot is lost to narrowed conception of processes and existing
functioning that may limit potentials for insight and innovation
beyond the existing boundaries, again due to convention if not
conforming to rules or patterns or models that may already work in the
given constraints or parameters- though these too also change and
transform over time, yet the 'ideas' attached to them do not, and
often approaches can become fixed ideas or conceptions, as if the
world does not change becomes a routine is continued the same, even
while everything is shifting underneath yet may be unrecognized in a
given approach or even denied, to retain a way of doing things and
thinking, beliefs, etc.
so, a potential exists and perhaps it is like basic research of
architecture or a given discipline, where it may not be ready to be
applied or may question fundamental assumptions and this is purposeful
and can be extraordinarily beneficial if it cracks open the
malmodeling that may become standardized as approach, and allow other
development to occur by falsifying given notions or providing
alternative paths or techniques. and yet also, infrastructure can
exist that forbids this from occurring, that limits any such
conceptions, or confines questioning to what amounts to only small
tweaks in the functional circuitry because it is a situation that is
nearly completely controlled and there is little room within for
fundamental changes and an entire system would need to be rebuilt from
scratch to replace what exists, otherwise. and there are dreamers who
do this, and architects who focus on utopia. or modeling of cities.
Frank Lloyd Wright (FLlW) had his vision for the development of the US
which was based on a different approach to city planning,
democratizing it via planning principles if not mistaken, though part
of this was developing a low-cost affordable home (if not made of
concrete), the USonian home, a unit or component in the larger
integrated plan of massive development. Le Corbusier had skyscrapers
and green spaces as part of the Ville Radieuse (my memory is gone
though approximating a general sketch of approaches) and both these
efforts were based on social goals, what architecture and master
planning can effect via focused development. and Arcosanti by Paolo
Soleri is yet another example, building a prototype community with new
building techniques as part of a larger vision that is potentially
counterpoint to the existing approach, and that there is a tradition
of this questioning of existing development patterns and yet it is
also fraught with issues in the realm of ideas as relativism bounds
such inquiry.
for accuracy it should be noted that this innovation in thinking has
basically evaporated from the practice of architecture, it is
completely without support as a research endeavor in the given model
of education and development, as if the technical approach + aesthetic
fashion is the peak sum of its content as fixed-idea, though it is
more a purification of given ideology intimately tied to existing
warped economic, social, political agendas evidenced as "culture" that
is antihuman, against nature, against thought, essentially
anti-architecture as it exists.
so the conceptual potential of architecture, the critical questioning
of assumptions can be lost or drown out by other priorities or values,
superseded by a particular view or agenda that in turn limits what can
be pursued in that domain, as it becomes normalized, made a shared
worlview, institutionalized. yet likewise, detached from fundamentals
edited or censored out of existence given the tyranny of convention or
otherwise, e.g. deceptive motivations.
and so at the edge of development, there could be little blood
occurring because there is no real-stake involved at this leading or
front position. it could be somewhat mundane or basic or commonplace,
detached from significance or risk, and more about continuing to
extend a particular approach than testing, questioning, learning and
pivoting into other unknown or newly discovered realms via discovery,
innovation, invention, failure even and falsfication of beliefs and
approaches. defeat of ideology. instead- there are no ideas,
potentially. just the same old beliefs repeated ad naseum yet without
questioning them again and again, thus to assume their rightness or
correctness through their repetition, no more integrity than that.
thus mediocrity as a type of security even, doing what has been done
as a validation process or confirmation of value, matching a pattern
as pattern and not its truth it must represent. and thus the
detachment, the moving away from what is vital, developing in the
wrong ways and directions towards a false viewpoint and framework, if
not at odds with what is needed. and this all occurs automatically-
especially in peoples minds and thinking, psychologies and relations,
as individuals and groups then combine into organizations, continuing
such efforts.
conceptual architecture is then about ideas. thinking through
architecture, architecture as a model, a medium for ideas. for
communication and relation. the importance of language in all the
above examples, and its fundamental relation to geometry (art, music,
architecture). and this fundamental consideration also involving a
kind of philosophical approach to the questioning, in terms of
research, the basics, fundamentals, foundation of disciplines and
beliefs, techniques approaches actions, methodology. questioning,
debate, discussion, the role of basic research in development, its
application over time via refinement, testing of hypotheses and
improvement of models and approaches. it is not just engineering
and it also involves a larger domain than just a detail, so while
research into concrete may always be ongoing, that concrete sidewalk
technology around for thousands of years since Roman times, the heated
sidewalk or improved wear or illumination or concrete via other
additives to the mixture is not in itself a larger modeling of the
depth and breadth of the question of architecture beyond that narrowed
realm- though can be incorporated into it as a vital detail, and so
definitely is related, though a part of a larger research enterprise,
a larger more encompassing and ecosystem view, where each detail has
its value and importance and insight, yet in the realm of ideas, 'big
ideas' need to occur to frame the big situations, and to limit these
to finite or specific details then bounds what can occur.  it is
equivalent to saying we can build skyscrapers to look like furniture
and if that is all it involves, a vast many other potential realms of
questioning or consideration can be lost in the process as it is
defined and conceived, in terms of what is and is not considered, put
on the table in terms of questioning. for most the skyscraper itself
as a building type has become a default solution, so too the high rise
city as a defacto approach to eco/soc/pol development, yet it is
fraught with vast many problems and creates and solidifies certain
patterns that are ineffective, inefficient, though believed the
correct way because that is the standard, the way things are done
today and how wealth or success has been generated. it is an engine,
in other words, that provides momentum to many industries and
questioning it as foundation could even be heretical. and thus if
questioning is removed, everything works just like a machine. yet a
machinery that is functioning against life, the earth, people,
economics, society, and other dimensions if a true accounting were to
take place beyond the controlled viewpoint that secures this approach.
conceptual architecture potentially could delve into these areas, yet
without support or even vital influence upon these processes, either
for being unrealistic or uneconomical or without existing capacity,
technology, or other limitations that restrict alternatives from
developing. again- the lack of research and its replacement by a
default 'ideology' the indicator that the process is determined by an
existing agenda that does not want to be fundamentally questioned in
its rightness, correctness as method, practice, income-generating
and yet an amazing discipline such as architecture can then lose its
soul, its essence, its insight and become shallow, ungrounded from
reality, and force disconnection through its development which then is
no longer actual or real architecture and instead something else, a
substitute process that stands-in for it as mimic, yet operating
within different principles that confine questioning to a narrow range
of consideration that basically destroys it, the ideas turning to
answered questions, architecture turned against itself, becoming only
a question of engineering, the art of construction being about
decorative buildings instead. though no deep insight into the human
condition beyond an archaeological condition where these forms can be
evaluated, analyzed, as they map to social, political, economic
issues, versus serving people as part of a heightened moral and
ethical obligation, service to culture and its development, not
turning away from it for money or just another career, etc. and thus
'the ideas' of architecture are nowhere to be found within the field
as it exists today, they are instead censored out of it by default of
the existing securing of ideology within institutions as this then is
the basis for further development within constrained parameters of
"design" that has more in common with the particularities of fashion
than wide-ranging investigation into questions and understanding and
development of culture in its highest manifestation, to include the
role of technology and its coherent and innovative integration within
built form, which instead becomes a manufacturers and industry
consideration: "smart homes", etc. this versus master planning of
civilization across all of its dimensions in a cohesive clear vision.
this as context for cryptography, in that there may be a standard
approach via public-key or other security systems in place that have
become normalized, made routine as processes and that assumptions may
readily exist as 'solutions' that remain bounded in given
considerations while there could be more going on beyond the existing
framework or limits of these same systems in practice, when evaluated
in terms of basic research, tweaked or tested or broken, and this
appears part of a vital process of improving and securing
cryptographic systems even. that a basic RD&D process exists already,
though to still question- within what parameters and is it possible
that the existing modeling is based on fundamental assumptions that
could in some way be limited or narrowed and a larger inquiry is
restricted because of these beliefs that become 'assumed truths' via
their restricted boundaries,  as if knowns or certainties due to
history or precedent yet these not brought back into questioning again
(reinterpreting of previous models, as if archeological ruins even,
where new insights may still be available or other approaches
discovered through their reevaluation and testing of assumptions).
it is to question if there may be a distinction made between
cryptography that is operational and active, that exists as an
infrastructure and working system (however rube-goldberg the issues of
implementation, chaos of variability as it connects with
secured/insecure modes), and what may be a more research-oriented
approach, not just into mathematical approaches to cryptographic
modules, and instead potentially further into the most basic realm of
crypto questioning, perhaps at the level of signs & symbols (language)
and how operations function (geometry) instead of an algorithm that is
operational as software approach or methodology, within a given or
existing set of parameters or assumptions that may be relied upon yet
also may be limited or even false in certain instances or deny other
approaches from occurring.
in other words, it is to wonder if there is a realm of 'conceptual
cryptology' that may already exist and yet not be defined or
understood this way, or 'conceptual cryptography' in a more particular
realm whereby these core questions of cryptographic models could be
pursued in their depth- or does the existing institutionalization of
these "ideas" restrict these inquiries due to a forced perspective of
ideology, a particular value system that relates to economic, social,
political pressures that retain a given approach for the good of
institutional control or manufacturing or to keep validating the
static conception, even as it may deteriorate within its 'ideas' made
static, assumed true by their repetition and continual access,
matching the sign equals sign as confirmation of correctness, versus
grounding in this greater depth of inquiry and realm of potential and
perpetual insight, when going back to the source and evaluating the
situation with fresh eyes and minds, in the dimensions that exist,
which could be far more than is modeled or believed or allowed in
existing approaches or functioning.
as with archaeology and architecture, it is to question if
cryptography may have a unique in situ condition at this intersection
of language and geometry, that currently may exist outside its
conceptualization in terms of practice, as crypto is developed
systematically, as it is made into infrastructure via technology,
manufacturing, and extension of these. and here, of the danger of
ideology, answered questions that move towards further falsity, as if
unconscious, when questioning of 'ideas' becomes detached from action
and through further development becomes ever more disconnected from a
fundamental condition of truth than in service to it. and what if this
integrity, securing this foundation of cryptography in truth is
requirement for security, yet given existing parameters could be
ignored in its philosophical dimensions that predate, inform, and give
life to the discipline, yet may not be valued or identified or related
to this way, as it becomes institutionalized or supported, made into
systematic development.
is there such an entity as 'conceptual cryptography' and where does it
begin and end. how might it be different than a primarily engineering
based approach or evalaution or crypto. to what extent is it supported
and operational as inquiry, yet what parameters or domain does it
occupy, including in past times and efforts that map out this
relation, its core questioning. could it today function in non-crypto
domains yet influence crypto development, etc. and thus questions of
the universality and connectedness of patterns, their permutations and
relations, potential interdisciplinary relevance as language and
geometry across mediums.
(if not involving inquiries and in-depth research at the junction and
structural intersection of linguistics and mathematics, and a
wider-range of potential communication strategies.)

== re: Amazon LCD tablet ==
i grew up studying those giant shopping catalogs for Sears and JC
Penneys stores that had inventories of everything in stores and that
could be mail ordered. they were seemingly hundreds of pages thick,
consumer bibles of specific national retailer chains in the U.S. and
for those without encyclopedia, did offer an interesting look into the
development of digital watches as they took over analog, calculators,
early computing, electronic and video games, and then 'electrics'
spanning tools to housewares, various large and small appliances.
when the Amazon Kindle lineup went from e-ink only into a
mixed-category of LCD screens it seems to blur the distinction in
purpose between the e-reader devices and more ordinary tablets that
compete with others, in particular ecosystem-based devices from Apple.
my initial thought was that there were two different categories
occupying a single name of "Kindle" and that they were functionally
very different devices with different purposes.
while it is understood that 'tablets' are a category unto themselves
and need no further justification for existence in an online retail or
software/app model, it struck me as strange that there was not
something more conceptual going on with the Amazon HD Fire devices,
beyond ordinary tablet functionality, at least from what reviews
mention about it in terms of user experience and how it streamlines
access to Amazon services through the tablet UI.
one thought has stuck with me about the potential for this
tablet-Amazon ecosystem relation and it is that this device now
competes with others in a general 'multimedia' tablet category, yet
its real and potential advantage in terms of apps or whatever is its
unique connection to Amazon inventory, which spans multimedia in an
intranet sort of way, perhaps as if portal.
from here, location, in this particular and unique context of
relation between those who access Amazon through such a tablet
interface, it would appear the killer functionality of such an LCD
tablet would be to provide 'catalog-like functionality' in the style
of earlier paper-based approaches, such as the Sears Catalog and
others, though perhaps beyond just existing approaches determined by
web interfaces and into a higher degree of functionality, such that
the tablet actually is the Amazon Catalog in electronic format, in
particular- mail-order format whereby, say, ala Whole Earth Catalog or
Hammacher Schlemmer, you could potentially order anything that Amazon
lines up into its supply-chain, even if for a one-time sale, via such
a massively connected inventory and integrated yet distributed
delivery system.
This probably sounds very bad to some peoples ears in terms of the
impact or effects this could have if suddenly Amazon is bidding on
installing pools in the neighborhood, though perhaps it would be
bounded to certain things like European appliances that are imported
or other high-rated, quality based interactions vetted by a
review-system recovered from the troubles of existing feedback
environments internet-wide.
curated merchandize, then, that is presented in deep categories of
content, with additional information (requiring dimensions of items
from manufacturers, etc) and matrix-based searching functions (using
grids and geometry to search instead of only keywords) that then are
the basis for a _new_design of the Amazon interface that standardizes
the interface and user experience with the available inventory,
instead of relying on existing web technologies to define parameters
for what can occur in these interactions, including variable results.
What this is to question is why the Amazon Fire LCD tablet is
competing in a multimedia category as if just another tablet when
instead it could be 'the Amazon Catalog' instead and while able to
deliver movies, music, book content, that ultimately a programmatic
hierarchy could exist that this is a platform for interfacing with and
accessing Amazon inventory firstly, before that secondary utility,
which allows delivery of online data (movies, movies) though also, and
primarily it is assumed: offline 'content' in terms of sales from its
warehouses and third party suppliers, and thus is the basis for
creating, sustaining, and developing this huge momentum in sales, or
having it operate in more conventional terms, competing as another
tablet in a highly competitive space, and perhaps not having this
catalog-functionality as its core mission to the extent that this is
how the tablet is designed, its fundamental purpose and advanced
functionality, versus just an extension of existing web technology
approaches that leverage an excellent e-commerce experience though
remain heavily defined by what is a very low-resolution 'catalog' of
its inventory, when instead there could be more extensive information
about each item, so that people do not need to research missing facts
or data repeatedly and instead it could be presented as advanced specs
(dimensions, materials, warnings; contains lead, requires widget Z),
that combined with expert reviews or more in-depth analysis could
transform the experience into a research-based activity where all of
the necessary data is in the Amazon Catalog, perhaps not the web
version, but the tablet catalog version that acts like an encyclopedia
attached to extended or other content or dimensions.
For instance, if a product attaches to a table, yet no information is
provided for how this connection takes place or how deep or thick the
table must be, the same item could be ordered and then returned if it
does not fit a particular table. And if this information is not
provided for in the reviews, then orders and returns are the 'feedback
process' that is in effect a negative interaction as a total exchange,
inefficient, and time-wasting for everyone when instead that
additional information which could be known to be critical (no less by
the product manufacturer) could be provided as _missing detail in the
current approach, in many cases, with sales across the online retailer
landscape. It could require several google searches of discussion
forums or downloading PDF manuals to get this information if it exists
or a call to the manufacturer, all that stands in the way between
simply evaluating the item and then deciding it will work and clicking
through the sale. Instead this short-circuit of necessary or missing
information could require dozens of clicks and several searches of
discussion groups looking for answers or clues to what may become a
mystery by default.
Consider then the condition whereby there is lack of basic information
in this entire process, encountered with online retailers and
e-commerce in general, not just Amazon of course. It is assumed when
product data went online, that perhaps nothing new was expected of the
items in the way they were modeled as 'data' in terms of their sale.
Yet for instance this same product was in a store in yesteryear, it
could be touched, evaluated as a 3-dimensional item, and if it
attached to a table the mechanism to do this could be evaluated or a
box could be opened by a worker to help evaluate the device to see if
it actually would fit a particular table or not - prior to sale. And
here is point: the information is available for the person in the
store, though when it is sold online this information may be
non-existent online even though it is a very basic consideration for
its practical and successful use in basic scenarios and everyday
conditions. It is unexceptional to ask such questions in an offline
context, yet when this same questioning occurs in a remote
'catalog-context' or 'online retailer' context often there is no one
to ask or anyone who knows the answer, and it instead is a gamble.
The way this is made to work is by offering free returns, and yet this
also effects other prices and is a structural inefficiency if it could
be solved and such returns unnecessary when they could instead be
avoided, due to an issue such as 'missing information' that is
important to the seller and the buyer, to know enough about the item
at the center of such exchange.
Thus, of various products sold online, consider if they had a more
robust and in-depth data model that consisted of various "dimensions",
and therefore if there were these attachment devices to tables, you
could narrow a search for such items not just by the main category
{tablet attachment}, and instead further by subset details, such as
{clamp to 2-3/4 inches} when others only may only open to 1-1/4 inch
and therefore would not fulfill the criteria.
And so in modeling a particular item or device, as category, it could
be modeled in various subset details that may already occur in areas
like HDTV sets, to some limited extent (a bit too fuzzy whereby false
positives are frequent as with many hierarchical approaches based on,
it is assumed words versus geometric structures based on such
functional details). In some sense it could be equivalent to a limited
'dimensional-search' via matrix, that in some cases may involve
measurement (height-width-depth), color, form or shape, materials, and
other specifics (calories, toxins, requirements). Then instead of
searching from the general to the specific, looking for the needle, a
person could start with the needle, knowing what they usually are
looking for -though cannot find- and located it through geometry of
such data.
In this way, potentially the future of online catalogs in a tablet
interface as it may streamline the process of interaction and exchange
with this data ecosystem of media and other goods.
(concepts: patterns, typologies, variable details, relational structures)
(also, this strategy could be used for other search via structurally
organized -if meta- data as a content or information search via
categories, dimensions, graphs and grid. dimensions, 3- and N-value
logic, set theory, AI interface and interactions. tending toward
'living queries' where, given parameters, search could continue or
map/carto/survey realms, provide reconaissance, report back data
structures, variables. this could be basis for custom data structure
of PC, a model built up over many queries, spanning local-global
structure, heuristic feedback, etc.)

detail, sometimes of major significance other times not in the 'ideas'
involved. sometimes innovative, etc. yet in a larger context or
situation, larger goals and functioning than just concrete itself,
alone, as the variable. in other words 'the ideas of architecture' are
not containable just within concrete, though it can and does have
major influence at certain stages and within specific approaches. its
conceptual innovation feeds into architecture and vice-versa,
symbiotic, including conceptual stagnation due to loss of larger
vision (ideas) and greater purpose at scales involved due to
narrowed_focus(), etc(etc).

 The Future
"Modern cryptographic equipment consists of nothing more than a 'black
box' with powerful digital processors and advanced mathematical
algorithms. There is not much to see, and there are definitely no
moving parts. We realize that this is probably where our collection of
historical cipher equipment will end. However, there are numerous
earlier cipher machines and much of this is still undiscovered. 'New'
old machines will, no doubt, pup-up and many side-tracks will be
walked. Furthermore, the history of some famous cipher machines is
still very clouded, leaving much to be researched and much to be
discovered in the years to come.
"On the Crypto Museum website, we have done our best to raise an
interest in historical cipher machines and cryptology in general.
Where possible, we will give as much background information as we can.
Perhaps you too will eventually get contaminated with the Crypto
Virus. If it happens, be careful as it might get under your skin.

The Mozart Effect myth: research finds music doesn't make you smarter
(note: headline made me wonder what the difference actually is in
terms of intelligence or ability to think and process information in a
different conceptual framework/model, from those who actually _play
music, to those who are _trained to remotely  reproduce "music", say
musical compositions repeated for 240 years from the institutionalized
cultural canon, versus making your own music, exploring musical
principles versus rote behaviorism that may remove those learning
principles from the interaction, so people as tape recorders in a
context of music playback, repeating someone elses musical learning,
versus developing their own via unique exploration and grounding. the
latter approach would seem to indicate 'new information' models could
develop whereas repetition of preexisting structures and approaches
may limit this to a realm of memorization, for instance. likewise, any
effects from playing music may require longer-term integration to be
expressed as intelligence, years even, as motor skills and new
neuronal connections and pathways take hold, rewiring the brain, and
six weeks is not going to allow this known and basic benefit to be
evaluated. it may be a time of peak confusion, instead, because it is
new knowledge not yet integrated so to test on that is to force its
benefits into a realm of observable tangibility it may not be able to
provide, though may still exist as this inside people, expressing
itself over a longer time.)

:-:-:-: Ten books - Vitruvius, recontextualization :-:-:-:
i wanted to substantiate an approach to crypto in a larger context
from its parallel within architecture as a discipline that involves
real-time development based on principles that are shared as a
framework and value system, in other words common consciousness about
a given domain or areas of importance or relevance as this effects
what can or cannot develop.
in the existing late 20th c. worldview my research interests into
electrification as critical to understanding the existing built
environment had no place within the history books. such views are
literally erased, censored from books, both as content though also
imagery, there are few 'electrical poles' in those fashion photographs
of buildings, removing the ubiquitous context of infrastructure, as if
they function in a more pure condition than are reliant upon an
external source of power, light, heat, than 'the elements' of nature
and sunlight. because those are the beliefs, shade shadow mass spatial
experience, pre-electric, communication about experience shared in a
context of 'the senses' removed of their electromagnetic truth, such
that ungrounded subjectivism and indoctrination into a world view is
established and _must be followed to succeed in the systematized view
and training to become an architect, within such narrowed parameters.
to continue to extend the existing ideology in this way.
so it was necessary to find justification for such thinking and
consideration, and Plato offers this in terms of conceptualizing the
state as a body, essentially a nervous system. and then considering
this in terms of its governance. how the individual and group are
established via various principles of relation, what is prioritized,
there were also many fragmentary views from Modernist masters relating
to electrical aesthetics, i think it was Walter Gropius who related
the eyeball to the television set, and Le Corbusier had great interest
in the aesthetics of electrification, generators, motors, turbines.
and so an archaeological aspect, yet not integrated into a larger
framework. so as it happens, this continues to a threshold where
scholar-architects Venturi, Scott-Brown, and Izenour share very
insightful observations about the developing electromagnetic
landscape, to include such aesthetics of infrastructure relied upon
(in the desert no less, for life sustaining a/c and casinos and
signage: essentially OASIS and MIRAGE), in their Learning from Las
Vegas and yet the strong and silent type still does not mention or
investigate the electrical order while certainly referencing it and
including it within the chaos of the built environment in the
photographs taken. and yet, in architectural history, there is
supposedly no precedent, no way to make the case that this
infrastructure is an extension of architecture, of fundamental and
foundational relation as an ordering device within the city grid, its
planned development (ala plug-in city, though originating millennia
ago). and yet there is direct lineage with these billboards along the
highway that cars drive by and signage along busy routes near ancient
cities, the present day is an extension of similar structure and order
over a long span of time. it is part of a language, although it may
become subconscious, mediated in other terms or only indirectly, else
could be edited out as 'not architecture' which is the default
what interested me about this, and i am not sure exactly the sequence
my readings occurred, though in deciding to delve into reading a
classic work of literature, the earliest account of architectural
authority (in the West) in terms of its classical culture and
development, if not mistaken, is that it was unlike the existing
conception of what architecture is, and had a far wider boundary for
knowledge and interpretation that today has been narrowed by special
and private interests in a 'training approach' to office workers than
an educational approach that questioned the parameters of
architecture, beyond a confined technical enterprise that overlaps
aesthetics onto a deterministic approach to answered problems of
culture, society, economic development, and political agendas driving
the development, its destructiveness.
Ten Books on Architecture - Vitruvius
so what took me by surprise is that the architect is speaking of not
only geometry and the proportion of temples and buildings at that
time, based on the classical ordering systems...
(Classical Orders: Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, Tuscan, Composite)
...though also about armaments and fortifications, about the quality
of water in wells (wells that produce black bile or something along
these lines), and various other important areas of knowledge in terms
of buildings and development in their larger realm of functioning,
which today would include areas like environment and defense as part
of this architectural inquiry and area of knowledge- for how
architecture exists and functions. In this way, to understand nature
and surrounding culture, infrastructure would fit into this same
approach, and without it the existing dwellings, buildings, the entire
built environment, cities themselves- do not make any sense because
they cease to function without electricity. A skyscraper no longer
functions in this era without electrical elevators and ventilation
systems, lighting, etc. A home would lose its washing machine, food
storage, communications ability, etc. And yet this vital and basic
information is left out of the equation, removed from architecture as
a viewpoint, which is ridiculous, and not allowed in 'reasoning'
within the schools likewise. In this way the ideas of architecture are
shallow, hollowed out of their meaning for a surface-based
interpretation, which serves a particular oil-based development agenda
the reason this was introduced here is because of ancient principles
now absent within the realm of architecture: approximated as
Commidity, Firmness, and Delight... these principles are often
presumed or claimed to exist for the given approach to image-based
development yet have become signage-only, language game seeking to
misrepresent what is going on, as if more is occurring, higher minded
activity than a base activity under the guise of architecture
Commodity, Firmness, and Delight, or Toward a New Architectural Attitude
(for instance, commodity replaced by anti-economy as 'economics';
firmness by using false foundation and understanding for development,
thus developing ungrounded civilization, and 'bliss of ignorance'
delight while this process is being subverted for ulterior motives).
There is misalignment and misrepresentation and short-circuiting and a
sabotaged detour going on within the ancient_tradition of
architecture, whereby today is functions directly against and in
opposition to these principles, most especially in the area they could
be evaluated and-or acknowledged, within the education system which
instead is ruled by an anti-architecture ideology. against thought,
against action, functioning against truth, grounded reasoning itself.
and then one day recently in trying to remember the above tripartite
concept, the mingling of its present incarnation as Fear, Uncertainty,
Doubt appeared in the fog of my mind, though was rendered as: Fear,
Uncertainty, and Delight, instead. and to me this illuminated this
very closely correlated development, removed of its camouflage, suc
that FUD is the equivalent set of principles by which development
occurs in a context of developing of this insecurity, uncertainty, and
incapacitation of people, most notably through ideology of relativism
and binary views based on biased authority structures and control over
reasoning and feedback.
another sample of wreckage from this same broken brain is that of the
Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, the book and also the excellent movie
(c.1949) with Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal.
there is controversy over interpretation of the ideas involved, though
i think an accurate grounding of observation neutralizes the beliefs,
when truth is the arbiter of actions and not just ego, as if belief in
superior vision is justification for higher awareness development that
others just cannot understand and thus lone geniuses stand alone in
obscurity, which then is how the corruption of the star system occurs
with celebrity architecture and development of 'aesthetic buildings'
are removed from larger issues of economics, societal, and their
political reliance and extension of given systems of corrupt power,
instead of questioning these, and thus in some sense 'the cathedrals'
built represent these values, as if glossy advertisements for a
culture devoid of culture, just about shiny objects and immediate
sensory experience that no longer connects with larger surrounding
issues or has a larger impact on lives than in an ecological negative,
like playing music on the titanic as it is sinking,  yet not
accounting for this part of the situation, as if heightened experience
when instead blindness. the entire system supporting this development,
all students, interning as peasants to upkeep offices that churn out
cultural pablum as if 'high conceptualization' when devoid of this, in
truth. then the conceit of the architect in this domain, as if
knowledgeable of what is going on as if in continuance of vitrivuian
awareness, or mastery within the built environment, when basic
reasoning and observation long ago failed in order to support the
ruling oppressive ideology.
so here is the contrast, the other way of considering this: that the
architect who removes themselves from the process of development as an
individual (i.e. human), then revolves around the issue of identity,
awareness, self-conception. issues of governance, models of the state
from individual to group, such that a 'shared identity' (humans) could
be this same individual and may have removed themselves from the
existing treachery, allowed this process of devolution to occur, and
thus the absence of architecture, its truth, then can be made evident,
the lack of culture in those 'representing culture' as stand-ins,
mimics, of a false order and false reality and false perspective
sustained and relied upon for the shallow relations based on another
foundation or set of parameters: say, base materialism, money.
further, 'the architect' may be assumed to thus be one person, one
individual, yet in this way a shared identity can compose this person,
such that the person is human, and as others are also human, they too
are involved in this condition, via shared awareness and values. thus,
a networking of realization or shared state as it were, via whatever
conceptual scaffolding or consciousness is sustained as entablature,
such that wave-collapse does not occur, and the post-and-lintel
connections between here and there are sustained between human beings.
likewise and vitally important, that 'architecture' is a
meta-condition as exampled by ancient conception that ranges beyond
the existing modeling, yet is fragmented and not integrated as a total
discipline in this way. naval architecture is one aspect,
traditionally, though also computer architecture and other areas. the
principles or even code, common structures, and programming (such
that, for instance, music and architecture are closely empirically
related, and essentially everything is, in terms of aesthetics in
terms of its truth and intelligence), then a wider range of activity
may be occuring as 'architecture' than is accounted for, and yet it
may be the truth of its condition, as certain principles are or are
not observed and served. for instance, serving public interest by
having safe water and waste disposal infrastructure versus relying on
toxic systems that despoil the environment, or stewardary of wildlife
and landscape and environments as this relates to weather and
ecosystems or denying these or exploiting them, say with engineering
weather for political manevering and strategy, and to enact certain
development patterns via forced desertification and manipulating
demographic and other flow patterns, as this can become an illegal
basis for creating and sustaining power, off the books, because it is
not included in the observations or analysis, unaccounted for.
further, that any 'architecture' is not at the hand and mind just of
the architect, though in its *implementation*, involving all who are
involved in its development, relying upon a shared awareness and value
system (truth) else subverted in its conception, communication, and
construction, by sabotage or other mistakes, errors, or misalignments
that weaken it. and thus the coherence in the group action to build
something upon a foundation, and how this is achieved, from idea to
its actualization (just like circuitry in technological devices that
then can break in or out of warranty via poor manufacturing or
deceitful practices baked-in).
it is this myth of completely independent action, that the individual
achieves something in its entirely -alone- that is a clean-room
conceptualization of a process that involves many who are part of the
larger process of design, construction, and development, and that this
'functioning together as one' is in some sense 'the architect' in its
larger coherent state, of shared awareness, continuum throughout the
various circuitry that establishes and sustains relations in their
truth, in the shared direction, moving together towards the same
goals. each person having an important role, each part having its own
importance in achieving functioning of the larger integerated whole.
not just as a machine, as a culture, as an idea though further- a
living idea, a living truth that is shared, that governs, principles
that are not merely referred to and referenced as if authority, and
instead, awareness and understanding that is based within and upon
knowing, a way of being or competency that develops in each as a
unique vantage of the common situation, another perspective yet
contributing toward a total perspective, allowing error correction and
greater accuracy than any single viewpoint.
in this way the people who create the materials are part of the
building process, part of the vital development of civilization and
culture, those who construct buildings and systems and develop this
order are vital for its implementation and have feedback and insight
to offer as part of this process, for how given approaches could be
improved or made more economical or with greater strength or
in this way, this coordinated empirical shared effort of many
functioning as one, to include engineers, designers, craftspeople,
tradespeople, workers, manufacturers, technologists, scientists, and
others, including programmers and security developers --- all of these
people are involved in the 'ideas' of architecture, as it is
integrated beyond narrowed boundaries and considered as a larger
conceptual model of how it actually functions, when accounting for its
various and many details and manifestations and dimensions that must
be developed, designed, built, and implemented correctly and
successfully, for the project to have integrity. to be able to endure
over time and function correctly, versus being designed and developed
to fall apart as today via any number of compromises or unshared
goals, lowered principle.
in other words, the potential exists that 'the architect' is in this
larger scale and framework of shared activity amongst many functioning
as one, and that no single person could feasibly be functioning in all
these domains, (unless extraordinary circumstances of all-knowing,
then all truth would be addressed not ignored in the building process,
tending towards utopia).
this is to suggest that 'architecture' could be occurring within a
wide range of realms that are not yet integrated in a larger
conception, conceptualization, or modeling accurately maps to its true
nature and functioning, its inherent interdisciplinary awareness that
integrates into a cohesive understanding spanning these various
domains. and lacking this, the conceit would be that a person could
know more than a tiny fragment of this immensity and alone be able to
shape all of these forces and meld them into a direction as an
individual, because of their truth, instead of having this be an issue
of 'shared identity' of those like who also relate to the situation in
similar dimensions and together can move towards a given direction as
one entity, diverse and multiplicitous yet organized, gaining not
losing coherence- order. and in this way, perhaps a context of entropy
and ideas, likewise, and security issues involved.
(in other words: it is not ungrounded group ego detached from or
ignoring 'truth' that is this shared momentum as development, nor of
an individual that is part of this. such that each pseudo-work is
considered 'the great work' that amounts to mediocrity, if analyzed
further beyond narrowed boundary. instead, of integrity, foundation
common to action, verified and sustained and modeled in its truth, in
service to it, then each point relating to others, lineage from one
structuring to the next, nodes interconnecting within dimensions, this
awareness, then interactions that build upon this stability, this
accurate understanding and modeling, such that it is a common or
shared development, it benefits the whole and the part and each is in
service to the truth of others who are operating within shared
principles, dimensions, and then learning from others, integrating
views, understanding, awareness, evolving a higher capacity and
improving, optimizing functioning, relation, communication, ability to
operate with cohesion yet still error-correct. what are the rules,
logic, truth, reasoning, falsifiability, the ability of debate to lead
to win-win interactions even while in contest because truth benefits
all through its discovery and development, new social dynamics and
understanding and awareness based on this, difficulties faced
betwixt-and-between as the conflict or friction is extreme, working
through the wrong models or moving through the false concepts or
limitations, breaking things down, pain and agony of not knowing or
having limited questioning and then requestioning, losing certainty,
only to regain basic truth and model for any interaction, governance
versus politics, basic versus applied, novice vs. expert, and role of
learning and literacy and basic questions as the place this
functioning occurs, as people move together towards a higher-order or
dimensional integration, over time...)

note: i am not familiar with the indepth reasoning of Rem Koolhaas
related to ~shopping as a cultural activity though to me it cracked a

so this is meant to provide context for the following ideas... that
is, there is more to gain from a commercial advertisement in its
cultural depth than just a monetary transaction. (this moves into the
business page of daily newspapers as a tally of ongoing applied
philosophy, where business philosophy is the presiding worldview, the
shared communication that most effects the transformation and
development of culture- as ideas. (moreso: ideology though, as many
sacred beliefs are unquestionable and most things occur in such rigid
frameworks, ungrounded from external variables and falsifications, so
essentially protected views that can be and are weak structurally,
though within a bubble civilization seem peak insight).
beyond scaling of unchecked materialism and profit-based onesided
exchange (of beliefs) there can be lots going on in the development of
material artifacts, processes, as these effect social relations,
activities, various detailing of or within culture, in given sets of
of the basic situation then of commerce, exchange, things that are
conceived of, invented or extended, -made-, developed into systems
small and large, then of the corresponding ideas attached to them,
that move alongside the movement of artifacts as they located in
culture, and find their place. as if shards of pottery someday to be
unearthed in various geographies that then matches a common culture
across distances and differences, via such evidence.

and then forget, once having known the basic situation....
part of the human nervous system is actually digital and part of it is
analog. and to me this is an important fact about the technological
environment people are living within, especially in terms of sensing
and how coupling with external signals and communications or
exfiltration of biological or physiological information could occur,
if not aspects of remote control over the nervous system via these
same means. and yet as shared view or model of humanity to discuss
ongoing oppressive dynamics in worse-case scenarios- non-existent! not
awareness or understanding except within a field of expertise that is
often politicized, such that there are agendas within professions;
political science -> political medicine -> political neurology and the
next thing you know a drone is flyign overhead and the emg-test you
last had forces a twitch in your arm via EM reflex and you drive off
the cliff. do not need to wait for automated cars to steer you off the
road, it can already happen today, if such systems are 'weaponized'.
what is to prevent such dynamics from existing if they are not
accounted for. and thus this is only one aspect, the danger of not
knowing, yet what may be realized if such a model of the
electromagnetic human was understood or part of the conceptualization
of shared relations, part of the intellectual framework that mediates
the world in a sea of toxic signalling, and what is the limit or
boundary for this happening, (the entire education system for
so a non EM-worldview and non-EM humans existing in electromagnetic
civilization as shared context yet believing the self 'outside' this
perspective for analysis and evaluation, having rationalized and
accounted for activity only in non-EM terms and conceptualization.
sounds like the wrong mathematics of zero again. what is the structure
of the human nervous system, how does this digital and-or analog
circuitry relate to issues of infrastructure, wireless communication,
potential frameworks for consciousness, embodiment, being.
(note: in exploring basic electronics, the category of sensors
fascinated me, especially in regard to common features they share,
such as strain, and their often ~analog nature, as well as a principle
of reversibility in functioning, as if of a deeper symbiotic
connection involved)

       "The nervous system is based on two types of communications:
those which do not involve arithmetical formalisms, and those which
do, i.e. communications of orders (logical ones) and communications of
numbers (arithmetical ones). The former may be described as language
proper, the latter as mathematics. (von Neumann, 1958, 80)"
Von Neumann's The Computer and the Brain, written in 1956 and
published in 1958, made the analog/digital distinction relevant to
philosophy by claiming that the logics and mathematics of the central
nervous system, viewed as representational systems, must "structurally
be essentially different from those languages to which our common
experience refers" (1958, 82). He has in mind here both natural
language and binary mathematics. [...]

as with crypto basics and possibilities, it is my belief that the
basic breadboard circuit in its actual dynamics has not been fully
accounted for, in that the relation of charge (+/-) including neutral
or  'ground' is not adequately modeled in accurate terms of existence
and instead a structural skew exists that sends everything into a
particular direction. also with crypto that becomes about mathematic
equations and 'beliefs' about signage, than of other dynamics that
exist in the same realm yet whose dimensions may be unrecognized,
ignored, or without value in a given methodology or approach, while
inherently relevant to the core ideas and cryptologic processes. i do
not think or believe the basic circuit has been figured out, that it
remains a question. that the analog digital aspects of the circuit may
be wrongly modeled or conceptualized in the actual terms they exist -
because LOGIC. because of a binary (and yes, thus 'digital' ideology)
approach that favors a certain rationalization as if universal
reasoning when it breaks down at a given threshold or boundary yet
continues on as a 'belief system' in certain assumptions and views
that can be inaccurate or illusory, if not deceptive, false. when the
dynamics between a basic circuit and model of the atom and thus
molecules in which the identical charge relations exist and provide
momentum -do not align or match up- in terms of how they are conceived
and what is going on with grounding (mathematics of zero), such that
"infinity" is made or modeled as if finite, removed from dynamics,
then the potential that is in the realm of N-value is also removed,
made 'digital' as it were even with analog modeling. and it would seem
so too crypto, 'quantum' processing itself seemingly more analog in
the range of parallelism as basis for computation, as a natural
process of equilibrium even, perhaps. and how much of the multi- or
non-linearity of circuitry, its ecological or ecosystem based ~complex
dynamics similar exist in this as a foundational, fundamental context,
firstly, before the digital even develops as a simple on/off switch,
then to represent and model _everything in that reductionist
framework, and claim its signage to represent all that is.
(without accurate logical accounting can such modeling be accurate in
its grounded truth, if this truth is unrecognized or unreferenced
beyond binary biasing and distortion (digital worldview?). how much of
observation is contained or trapped within its warping(etc);)
maybe thinking is not up-to-speed with material interactions, a gap
between models and reality, yet beliefs in accurate representations
that are limiting, based on misconceptions. thus, remove logic
(empirical and error-corrected grounded reasoning) and
electromagnetism, and try conceptualizing computers and crypto in that
context and see what happens. this.
computers are based on _logic, yet a particular kind that is warped
and ideological and is in error as a neutral observational viewpoint.
developing this bias as technological worldview is then enshrining a
false empiricism and vault of the 'digital sky' as consciousness when
it acts and functions against actual consciousness in its ungrounded,
unchecked state, as if 'being' itself. exploitation of this condition
(a kind of magic, sorcercy) tending towards evil as it moves further
and further away from truth and serves and extends the false approach,
what is essentially a shared lie if facts and truth are ignored,
censored, etc. total power, control over a developing system that at
its core is based on error. here, morality, ethics, absence of law
that upholds the false framework as it is institutionalized,
"believed" via leap of faith, ignoring the gap, denying the gap, for
all the material rewards it can yield to its developers. unchecked of
course, forbid from error correction. the representation replacing
reality. the sign becoming truth, that detachment, ungrounded
condition. just like circuit & adam.

form of secondary censorship. Fahrenheit 451 tactics- actual crypto

2. if everything is backdoored already, essentially key escrow exists
as the basic situation, instead of having private keys the NSA has a
master key per standard, implementation, other. if this was inside a
known legal framework, that perhaps would be tolerable with oversight,
yet without oversight where tyranny takes over, then everything is
pawned/owned by NSA who could forcibly censor without consequence as
part of a hidden political strategy, etc.
(all tools broken so a crypto scheme can function, leading to all
tools remotely breakable?)
3. question of literature as applied cryptography in
linguistic/typographic model, and also cryptology in decryption
approaches to embedded codes and ciphers, yet perhaps not a strategy
for encryption within ordinary bounded means and measures. are there
in this way two or more distinct approaches, only one that finds
itself in the parameters of computer encryption/decryption as modeled,
and the others reside in a realm of data mining and other statistical
correlations that may function in a realm of cryptanalysis and-or
code-breaking though using different tools and approaches than strong
encryption that currently reigns.
4. is there a unified crypto scheme or is it fragmented and does not
recognize itself in the mirror as its own 'whole' self due to a limit
for this structural-conceptual integration. in this way could
cryptography be schizoid in having two or more parallel systems,
disconnected strategies that function outside boundaries of the other,
and may remain unrecognized. that is, literature/language/linguistics
as crypto versus mathematic encrypt/decrypt schemes, each having their
own ecosystems and boundaries, paths that may never cross or meet
within the given parameters or dimensions as evaluated by the other,
or may exist as unbroken ciphers within other ciphers, encrypted code
within decrypted communications that remains unrecognized due to this
unrelated, ungrounded condition between them.
5. in this way could having 'answers' at the ready (GOTO 2) then
provide confirmational bias that a correct decrypt has been achieved
within a limited view that then becomes foundation for a false
perspective, represented by mathematics. and may a particular
rationalization (GOTO 1) that is enforced as if objectivity defined,
then become the basis for an illusion of mastery or control over
limited dimensionality and observational frameworks, themselves
becoming the basis for an insecure crypto framework (see 1). in other
words, without or banning abberations, then leading to a false
condition of certainty by containing what is or may be uncontainable,
making finite the infinite question and potential parameters into a
'small world'(model); ineffective at best in accounting for actual
crypto, operating.
6. does a hybrid crypto approach exist that remains unrecognized,
whereby both a linguistic even 'literature-based' crypto could exist
alongside mathematical encryption techniques yet remain unrecognized
in the "official" institutional model of cryptography, perhaps even
with a missing cryptological foundation or background, that limits a

Keeping the lights on: Mechanical engineer
finds a way to predict cascading power outages
"Each individual component does not know what the collective state of
affairs is," said Mezic. Current methods rely on a steady, abundant
supply, producing enough energy to flow through the grid at all times,
regardless of demand, he explained. However, should part of a grid
already operating at capacity fail—say in times of disaster, attack or
malfunction—widespread blackouts all over the system can occur.
"Everybody shuts down," Mezic said. The big surges of power left
unregulated by the malfunctioning component can either overload and
burn out other parts of the grid, or cause them to shut down to avoid
damage, he explained. The result is a massive power outage and
subsequent economic and physical damage. The Northeast Blackout of
2003 was one such event, affecting several U.S. states and part of
Canada, crippling transportation, communication and industry.

this observation arose from a recent conversation about influence
of alcohol on behavior and mood. where someone who drinks can
say things that they otherwise may not, and in this way a given
viewpoint may have a deeper grounding in the emotions that are
not being accounted for, and could be realized or accessed when
decompressing or reaching equilibrium in another phase or state
of awareness, via inebriation. the role of legal & illegal substances
in relation to edge of insight and cultural development likewise.
thus the aberrant statement or communication that may occur
via this communication is not necessarily less truth, only that
it may not be acknowledged or accounted for in the given view
or modeling. thus, a kind of equilibrium or balancing of forces,
or equalization across parameters known and unknown, those
documented and hidden, via inebriation. for instance, anger if
it arises when drinking and hidden rage. or following ideology
and then when inebriated a person letting down their guard &
speaking their mind, etc. in this way, truth and ideas that may
not fit in the given model. and how this could be an influence
upon culture and conformity if removed and this unwitting or
known feedback does not occur, and a rigid view is upheld
as the cultural standard, instead. where this balancing of
forces may not take place due to its prohibition, even, as
this could advantage those managing skewed modeling
and using it to enforce a given approach, and limit any
alternatives because it does not fit inside the mindset
or belief system, and cannot be questioned beyond this.
in this way, sobriety is equated with a higher knowing or
state of being, potentially, seeing more clearly, when if
in its position it is bounded or limited, these areas of
previous feedback would essentially be outlawed and
not addressed, or set up a schizoid state of relation
by denying other dimensions or relations or dynamics,
as if everything is contained with a rationalization even,
versus breaking-through that boundary into chaos and-
or the unknown, or challenging beliefs about what truth
is and where control originates in the cosmic context.
in that there is a limit to what can be determined via
reductionism, though no limit to the belief of this,
which can stand uncorrected, opposed to truth and
greater evidence than what is allowed or sanctioned.
leading to this...
i understand the different interpretation, and did not
adequately define the analogy, well enough to be make
the correlation clear enough. in the book by Ray Bradbury
it is the truth and ideas in the medium of the book that are
at issue, not just books but their use as a transmission of
beliefs, of alternative (non-sober) principles that challenge
the ruling order that seeks to extinguish this otherness
that is essentially culture itself, knowledge, reality. that
is the basis for control over people and the civilization.
what this extends into further in a cryptography context
is that 'crypto' itself may be outlawed like books, not for
technical means to communicate, but because what is
communicated could be _secret and not controllable by
those who seek total control over what occurs in society.
thus truth, another viewpoint shared by people, especially
if counter to corrupt government, could be this fire held in
the container of crypto, and if it is broken by default and-or
corrupted by design, this other viewpoint could never develop
beyond a given set of parameters because those who think
differently are seen as and believed to be 'the enemy' within
a state that has become rogue and functions against its
own people, in order to forever secure its power over them.
in other words: ideas, truth, shared reasoning is the danger,
and if it cannot be safely exchanged without consequence,
losing your job or career or having ideas disallowed and thus
trading in bad thoughts, as if drunken ramblings even, then
through this prohibition of ideas and thinking, as it relates
to grand inquisitor like auditing of any private domains and
whatever "secrets" people may be sharing, then could be
equivalent to peering into the war plans of the enemy and
all of this could be mapped out into a strategy that seeks
to eliminate this risk of unknowns, to uphold empowered
and extending rationalization within a particular system
of belief that aligns with private politics and corruption,
state of hidden dictatorship, and engineering failure so
to sustain the corrupt works as enterprise planning.
in other words, no crypto, no protected boundary for
freedom of expression or freedom of thought/speech,
communication, or practice of religion even, without
hidden judge, jury, potentially executioner via NSA
and others who are like the monster under the bed,
though inside computers, minds, communications.
where did they get the right to enforce and defend
mediocrity, to pursue and extinguish truth that does
not fit into or is opposed to the ruling political ideology,
and to not have any oversight and be given carte blanche
to pursue a political agenda against citizens, a lawless
agenda that is actively oppressing people in civilization,
and seeks to uphold and enforce an unreal, antihuman
viewpoint that is based on subjugation and exploitation.
i mean if the NSA was going around abusing children
and connected with pedophile networks and seeking
to blacklist and exploit people based on porn habits
or enforcing a no-masturbation rule by "government",
that would be a pretty important insider story, no?
those are the politics also involved in these questions,
the kind of substitute culture that can at once uphold
an unrealistic worldview only to use this for exploitation.
that is what happens in situations of corruption, and in
situations of total corruption, it is institutionalized and
made mainstream yet cannot be communicated about.
so if the crypto is non-existent, so too is such reality.
anyone who starts to think can be persecuted by the
criminals and taken down in isolation, and framed as
if just another sinner via the inside-subversion. that is
how books with another viewpoint can offer perspective
otherwise outlawed, so too working cryptography that
cannot be decrypted. without it, shooting fish in a barrel.
i vote those who work at NSA should be made to wear
helmets and uniforms, and wear big 'key' medallions
around their necks, so we know we are totally owned.
(not sure which way the rubber hose prop should go,
if firehose or perhaps each wearing condom bandoleer)
NSA is watching you masturbate!

additional correction/repair of perspective anomalies and errors...
.// further CORRECTION: once again clarification is needed regarding a
previous statement. this is both due to my own limits in
conceptualization and writing and also problems of language, when it
is extremely difficult to encompass all possible cases in a general
view without having contradictions. in my latest errored statement,
the mistaken view is quite large and so must be countered with more
information. i do not have the particular language nor have i
developed the understanding or framework for these dynamics as of yet,
so wrote into a realm or beyond a structure already developed and thus
encountering significant failures in approach. i.e. stating that
'concrete is only a detail' in architecture. the problem is that this
is not true in some situations, and also the word/concept 'detail' is
not the correct word for what i am trying to describe though i am not
sure what a better word would be, feature or substructure or element
or component or structure yet none of these likewise fit either.
though of course there are many who could better state the same ideas
within an improved POV with more accuracy and much more insight and
more knowledge of the issues involved.
so my approach is limited. the language also. and i equate it to is
the following mistaken viewpoint about concrete in architecture, in
special cases:  it is to assume that the sand is only a detail of the
beach. and this is largely false. it _is the beach, or a major or
significant element along with sky and water and wind and waves. it is
a major component, not minor.
and yet in most architecture the concrete involved does not take
center stage, it is another component, so it tends towards a larger
assemblage of components functioning together and is not the main
event. many times concrete is dressed by other facing materials,
skins, that shield it from the weather and provide a different facade
than CMU or precast panels and yet there are also buildings that are
just CMUs and precast walls and-or floors/ceilings. though their
significance in terms of the total building may still remain that of a
quasi-detail or more minor component or insignificant beyond just
being a barrier or boundary, such that the language may not be
explored or developed or insightful and may have inert presence, such
that it is more about 'nothing' than 'being'. say an industrial
warehouse with no windows and a simple door on an exterior that is
otherwise all concrete, with a company logo as sign.
perhaps this is not just a detail though it is also not going beyond
certain dimensionality in its functioning, it is basic and not
necessarily interwoven into other themes beyond utility, such that it
provides structure or boundary, security, enclosure, perhaps texture,
color, scale. it may be unwise to compare it straight away with a CPU
enclosure, as it relates to what is inside the box, though to some
extent this can be a disconnection or simple boundary that is already
defined in its functioning in many ways, by default, unless explored
further. and thus building is often differentiated from architecture
as it does not have this additional layer or level of investigation,
inquiry, innovation, questioning of parameters, function, beyond this.
so in some sense it is a big SIN to not have remembered epic examples
to the contrary where concrete cannot be said to be just another
element or, again wrong-worded, only a detail, as this warps its
contribution and conceptual potential that has been explored (most
notably by Le Corbusier and others). a few examples to provide
Notre Dame du Haut
[images] this chapel by Le Corbusier located in Ronchamp, France, is singularly
in concrete, it defied the existing conceptualization of how the
material could be used and likely still does. it is the determiner of
many architectural dimensions, space, massing, light, enclosure,
walls/ceiling, roof, and if memory serves the massive roof appears to
float when inside, even though made of massive concrete. thus the
gravity of the material has been reverse or inverted. this is the
height of aesthetic mastery, the language of architecture through the
medium of concrete. and more, the use of a ship analogy and metaphor,
its significance in architecture, rendered in concrete as the roof. it
is assumed also medieval fortifications which used to have walls of
several feet thick were related to concrete thickness, when such walls
were once foundation and required to be this thick, which continued
into tall buildings such as skyscrapers when supporting several floors
above them, prior to steel and concrete construction. so perhaps those
(correctly stated) details of windows refer to that earlier language
or pattern. further, there was innovation with formwork such that
textures on the formwork would transfer onto the set concrete forms,
thus revealing wood on its surface, as part of a new technique that
was developed by Le Corbusier. and so this refutes any notion of
concrete only as detail. it is the defining feature across many
dimensions and structures, it almost singularly defines the building
beyond its stained glass and wooden pews. completely captivating in
its essence, and this essence is concrete. and it is a deep
connection, deep awareness, grounding within the material as it is
made into form and functions within a myriad of different parameters.
(also, this built organic form (1954) in relation to sculpture...)
Brancusi sculpture Bird in Space (1930-40) or other
consider then another structure...
Sydney Opera House
it is iconic for its form, resembling billowing sails made of precast
concrete. having visited neither of these structures, it appears
likewise a majority of the building exterior consists of precast
concrete panels. thus another example that 'concrete is not just a
detail', which in these cases is an absurd and ignorant viewpoint,
when universalized. it is the major or prime structural component
though also the basis for conceptualization, the medium that is relied
upon and explored to express or develop such a unique language of
form, based upon the specific and unique properties of concrete in its
various techniques and approaches, many of which are invented by
architects for buildings and have never been built before. thus this
is a realm of large-scale experimentation, the limits of construction,
and daring work even.
it should be noted that recently i encountered a reference to this
building which said how beautiful it was on the outside as a concert
hall, yet the acoustics on the inside are or were horrible, and thus
the building aesthetics and its interior programmatic functionality
were not matched- though this is also why acoustic engineering exists,
which can often optimize a space in such scenarios. the difference
here is that buildings in the past, when having a main function like
'music hall' or 'opera house' were designed around acoustic properties
firstly, if not mistaken. and this is not about chance, how sound
exists in a given space in terms of its size, shape, proportion,
materiality, etc. and thus the outside-in approach, versus inside-out
approach, and how this can conflict perhaps most especially in terms
of the present day where 'image-based' buildings have their external
form as the main development or feature and functionality is presumed
to default to a usable correlated equivalency, yet can also be
hollowed out of meaning, superficial, merely about the surface and not
insightful in other realms or other substructures or components. a bit
like a building that is masquerading, and appears one way yet under
the mask is another way. like fancy aesthetic structures that are
miserable to be inside or just mediocre, yet praised for their looks
or drama, yet less livable or even dysfunctional or needy, requiring
high-maintenance, concessions by its occupants, which is its own type
of lost economy or friction that indicates peculiar approaches,
it is hard to convey how central aesthetics are to knowledge yet when
removed of its role as a grounding of philosophy, of shared belief and
truth, values, knowledge, as materialized, it then can become detached
and move into a realm of relativistic babble, greater accounting does
not take place, and images can be deceiving, illusion or manipulations
of the senses.
another realm of 'concrete is more than detail' it is
conceptualization itself is within the realm of Brutalism, a
particular movement or style in architecture...
Brutalist architecture
as should be obvious, my observations are only limited and there are
people with vast understanding who have researched these issues and
who have expertise, though some of this also is intuitive, from living
in civilization and environments where such buildings exist and define
a space, within given parameters. and I have a fondness for a local
example, at least in its appearance, which tends towards fortification
though has also been evaluated as a response to student unrest on
college campuses, an embodiment of the fortification of the
educational system against students and populations, visible in
aesthetics of built form.
Boston City Hall
so in the history books i read that defined a particular shared
consciosuness, this building is one of the main examples. and it is
implicitly 'concrete' in more than detail, it is seemingly in its
conceptual entirety, in that it melds what is material also with the
mental awareness of concrete as metaphor or analogy, as if anchoring
something into the ground, making an idea it into a tangible truth,
via securing of spatial-order vis a vis security or fortress, or
whatever. in that an underlying realm of hostility and unrest or a
different mapping of experience may better be realized or understood
in these more stark forms and encounters, as if the realm of
ubiquitous surveillence maps more readily into these aesthetics even,
then those buildings of high gloss, shiny distracting objects. in
other words, you could probably use this building for military
purposes even, or some such structures, because of their more
fortified nature than all-glass facades, and a more primal or
primitive relation could be established, more natural perhaps with the
social Darwinist/Spencerian survival of the fittest dynamics, if not
even towards a Planet of the Apes retro-futurism of some kind. again,
concrete here is more than the material, it is a larger connected
essence and its language is developed in depth.
Rarig Center for performing arts at U of Minnesota (local example)
so there is a difference in how a medium develops, in what terms and
parameters, what ideas are explored and what conceptualization is
involved. it can be contained, and thus a material could exist only as
a detail in some or many circumstances, yet in others it could become
a major or main event and take on a primary role, and become a realm
of peak inquiry and innovation. this both in terms of language and
geometry/mathematics, of structures and aesthetics, as it relates to
concepts, patterns. or it could be unquestioned and an issue of
utility, relied upon to do once again what has been provably done
before within given parameters. yet to describe all of this dynamic
range within linear strings is impossible and arbitrary, because it is
far more involved, and requires clarification for each and every error
or misconception and thus words words words to seek to repair faulty
frameworks and reasoning that is limited, bounded, to particular
constraints or points of views, etc. and thus this condition of
language could itself be the gap or mismatch with the issues of
existence, the impossibility of accurately relating to what is going
on in its ubiquity and depth within the parameters it exists within,
without being trapped in warped, distorted, and biased if not untrue
or only partially-true statements that then function as communication,
there appears no way to fix this within linear language itself. this
as it relates to code and to programming likewise. it is a trap, ideas
and concepts cannot be empirically developed within words to a degree
of fidelity required to attain 1:1 conceptual models. thus, also,
software ever disconnected from what it seeks to represent in these
same scenarios.
it is the artificial and misleading, false 'nature of things', this
language-based communication about events and seeking to model events
within signs that are linearly described, looped, versus within
molecular dimensional structures - circuits - that can actually
account for all components, elements, details and events in whatever
degree and fidelity they may exist.
one stray example arises repeatedly in my mind about the nature of
architecture as it has become detached from a larger accounting and as
this relates to core principles. it used to be a goal to have a
structure last, to endure over time, as part of the goal. today
instead planned obsolence has taken hold so buildings may stand for
only 30 years before being demolished. consider this in terms of how
it influences design, what issues are addressed and ignored, and how
much material is wasted to continue such an inefficent process that
also stands-in for development as an engine, process, or flow of
activity that circulates money around. in that it is a circuit, how
this functions.
no doubt there is aesthetic beauty in many buildings though what it
often hides is that other issues are being ignored (such as
environment, planning, social relations) and architecture can just be
about the image. perhaps like those apps that can be easily created by
putting various parts together, throwing an interface on a given
structure, yet that is not innovating beyond a particular level of
inquiry or set of relations, which then become bounded, limiting.
the following observation is not to question the legitimacy of
approach for the building in its functioning, which is built like
others by star architects all around the globe. so it is not to single
it out as an example, though it provides a case in point regarding
certain values that are taught of in school that in practice are
seemingly no longer of significant importance...
consider the birds nest stadium built for the 2008 Summer Olympics...
Beijing National Stadium
while of great beauty, there is also great dismay at the material
design involved due to issues of economy. in school they teach you of
surface area, how this relates to heating and cooling of a structure,
and how each and every joint or connection is a potential weakness,
whether for water or rust or expansion/contraction failures from
stress and strain, including between different or particular
materials. how a building is put together and funcdtions over time.
that this is part of its success or failure.
and my immediate thought or reaction really upon seeing this 'visual
structure' was the known extreme maintenance it would require over
time, in having to maintain/upkeep the 'visual structure' via
presumably paint and-or rust protection, for each angled connection
and joint and surface. perhaps it will not rust, perhaps it requires
no painting. yet if it does it is certainly non-trivial as to the way
the building functions over time. unless like most stadiums these
days, it is destroyed after 30 years time.
(in some way the detachment from larger considerations allows this
narrow 'design development' to take place in architecture, it is in
some significant way a form of luxury, yet detached from
responsibility, afforded by ignoring other vital aspects, decadent or
based in excess, disregard for economy beyond economics, as if
architecture is financialization writ large even. the embodiment of a
business philosophy detached from the surface of the earth in its
actual truthful accounting and functioning instead within parameters
of a fairy tale that is never spoken against, to sustain the illusion
or delusion that aesthetics can be primary without also securing their
foundation, connecting it with deeper truth. instead it can be
shallow, hollow, or unsteady, and may not withstand the momentums of
culture as it continues to advance or stall out over time. there is
something of a treachery involved in 'image-analysis' that lacks a
larger framework for its evaluation, and yet this has become the
guiding 'philosophy' of architecture likewise, to which students must
kneel down before such ideas as if of superior nature and awareness
versus cutting corners and in effect, cheating the discipline of its
integrity and substituting it with a lesser set of goals and ideals
that tend towards the profane instead.)
in some ways it seems that code can be like this also. that there can
be structures that are difficult to maintain or upkeep yet are
developed in a way that there is no way to sustain them over time.
tens of millions of lines of code say, that cannot simply be renovated
or simply tweaked or fixed up. it appears almost as if a prevailing
ethos of development both online and offline, in software, hardware,
and material development, processes and procedures as this maps to
business, social relations, and how knowledge exists and moves into a
particular direction, as if a kind of momentum or flow within a given
circuit whose parameters best or most optimally function in this way,
yet may not add up to more over time, and more require a limited or
bounded relation or condition for their existence. in that this
interaction or limited engagement is the nature of the material so
conceived, considered and that another system or material approach may
be required to develop other options that are not preconceived or
pre-wired into the existing approaches and "economical" methods that
can lack the foundation needed to develop cohension in other areas,
shared realms of inquiry, larger modeling or conceptualization beyond
the finite, separate, iconic isolation that becomes based and reliant
upon principles that may function against larger, longer goals, simply
by using existing approaches that have ideological functioning

comment: so here in the Great White North, one year all of the sudden
many people on local television were complaining about the fact that
there is snow in Minnesota. i had never heard anyone in my life
complain about snow in Minnesota, as if it was a negative event. who
are these people? when did the population get replaced? - and it
seemed that another kind of person now existed in the area who was
fundamentally not from here else did not belong, and hopefully finds a
place they like better. rather than stand in snow complaining about
so take an event X that has certain functioning and variables, that
could even be its nature, what makes it what it is (X).  thus, X=snow.
and then consider a place (MN) as being invariably tied to this
condition, such that MN=X within a certain range of parameters, say
and for many, as long as they have shelter, warm clothes and boots, it
can be an enjoyable time. if not, you may not survive. though snow and
winter have profound aesthetic value as a transformation from what is
known into another realization and understanding of the same place,
within differing parameters (light, color, temperature, clothing,
transportation, etc). so living in the north can be an education in
itself, knowing about winter, learning from it.
the larger situation is repeated elsewhere. in particular, in
educational contexts that have also migrated online as a type of
disapproval of certain natural functioning and awareness. most
notably, discussion groups online where a given [topic] will then have
limits placed upon its exploration, even though inquiries may fall
squarely within a given domain. and to this my response is similar:
who are these people, where did they come from?
for instance, the basic principles of [disciplines] such as
architecture can be censored in discussion or other areas (cultural,
technological) because it falls outside the artificial lines or
boundaries so conceived by a given ~managing population. such that
'the ideas' cannot be discussed, in their natural habitat, which
instead relies upon a definition of a place such that: place=not-X. or
in other words: topic = not-topic. insofar as it challenges a given
ideological boundary. and this can be as unnatural as believing 'snow
is bad' in Minnesota- fundamentally unnatural as a viewpoint. yet so
too, 'architecture is bad' for architecture, and onward. 'security is
bad for security' etc.
and perhaps this is evident in boundaries that are upheld and
constructed, maintained, such that certain issues and ideas cannot be
discussed due to enforcement of limits, and these may not have
anything to do with secrecy via NDA and instead, of wrong ideas and
thinking that challenge the status quo interpretation and belief
system (religion as state, essentially), yet that substitutes a
condition of truth with another, a pseudo-version that is fake, unreal
by comparison, and yet upheld as the basis for relation and exchange.
in that, having a negative view of snow in Minnesota, at least for me
and those i have known, is going against what makes this place what it
is, in its depth and connection with the area. and viewing 'ideas' as
negative that have this connection with a given topic or
understanding, likewise, unnatural and out-of-place. indicative of
other dissonance, ungrounded relations. to forbid 'ideas' of crypto
within discussion of cryptography, poo-pooing it, for instance, would
be an interesting realm to consider for how deep this disconnection
could go, thus revealing a surface relation or deception reliant upon
the not-X condition to sustain itself, or in this case, the need for
insecurity, obscurity, unknowing, disconnection, as vital to the ruse.
all such betrayels of truth reveal themselves in how truth is related
to, observed or ignored.
consider in this context, then, how might the government ever combat
issues of 'cyberspace' if its relation with electromagnetism was never
allowed to be established; such that:
     cyberspace = not-EM
on NSA interview on 60 minutes: it was stated that the interconnection
between various computer analysis systems (metadata) was needed to get
the 'whole picture', in that it is necessary to engage the situation
at the scale it exists. without this, conceptual blindness due to
limits or boundaries that prevent greater understanding of how things
now consider an entire university system, education system down to
gradeschool, that is forbidden from uniting its metadata beyond
compartmented views. that is essentially the condition today that
enforces illiteracy and makes it impossible to reason about advanced
situations beyond finite language games:
      culture = not-EM
everything that is connected via electromagnetism, and
interdisciplinary via shared structure and order of truth, is denied
by its lack of inclusion, allowance, and validation by authority - and
get this: on the basis for superior (private) belief based upon what
amounts to religious opinion, that instead censors truth so that this
wider viewpoint cannot be established. leave it up to some girls in
gradeschool to challenge the paradigm on a science project, the very
situation that cannot be addressed through reason otherwise, due to
issues of power.
the NSA gets its integrated metadata. the citizens and education
system does not. this is to include EMF hazards and electropollution
in relation to telecoms and telephony, etc. what about metadata of
[this] connected with contradictory data of [that], working all of it

with business philosophy, application of principles, their mediation
that can have economic, social, political effects, un-shared beliefs, &c.
(for instance, a worker in a production process has insight into how it
is and is not effective and can offer feedback for tweaks, improvement
or not allowing this and having that inefficiency/ineffectiveness built-in
and then normalized, including as relational ideology, that can limit the
engagement with the situation or force disengagement, detachment.
in other word, testable hypotheses of flow and routine functioning or
are these unquestioned and enforced to uphold given social relation)
likewise, what may appear only commonsense today - having enough
room to maneuver in the kitchen and use appliances effectively - can
extend as a conceptual question into the present and future day, such
as how the pantry, kitchen, and e-commerce in an automated scenario.
this was part of the idea for the Asperger Management System (AMS),
whereby a home computer system (data furnace) would use A.I. to bid
on restocking pantry, perhaps even in a financial market sense, where
'group bids' for a local community could exist to purchase wholesale,
and so an exchange could develop and suppliers to fill the contracts.
this would then integrate the 'intelligent refrigerator' with pantry,
and then have an A.I. data furnace device manage routine orders,
based on patterns that could include weather, past price history.
and of course a dwelling would need a way to store/allow packages
when people are away from home, to allow deliveries at any time.
note here the vital role of both encryption and security protocols.
(this leading to how existing courier/shipping services function, in
that people can wait all day for an e-commerce shipment to arrive
when instead an e-commerce portal or secure drop box could exist,
and before that, wireless updates when a driver is on their way to
a destination, providing a 30 minute window or lead-time vs. 8 hrs
via wi-fi and network-based updates of when a package may arrive)

@_subject: PVDF and you - (01) 
so i have been researching PVDF piezo film sensors
via a technical manual [0] and there is a lot here that
may be of potential interest in terms of its applications,
[1] especially its use in security systems and to prevent
tampering, and energy harvesting, in addition to other
areas where its unique functionality could be explored.
what follows, a series of short posts about this material...
0a. Measurement Specialties PVDF technical manual (PDF)
0b. technical manual with Appendix of piezo film articles
1. Measurement Specialties Piezo Film Product Guide
so PVDF is 'piezo film' that has unique properties and
capabilities. while i know little of functional electronics,
it is said to be a capacitor that stores and discharges
high voltage energy. like a piezo disk it picks up the
vibrational energy due to structural deformation that
then generates or moves charge in response to this.
the application i recently first encountered it was with
'contact microphones' - where it was stated that these
PVDF film tab mics record the vibrations as sound input
rather than acoustic pressure of condenser and dynamic
capsule microphones reliant on soundwaves moving the air.
so the distinction is that this piezo film can function as
a recording input or SENSOR though by registering the
vibrations on the surface of a material. what is more, it
also detects temperature differences and thus can be
employed as a sensor this way as well, which i did not
realize was possible nor expect for a 'microphone'.
the PVDF film apparently is already used in security
applications within computers, if not crypto systems
protected from tampering, via vibration sensing that
triggers lock down or equipment destruction based
upon monitoring of piezo film signals at perimeter.
PVDF film for Tamper-Proofing, Security (white paper)
(interesting likewise is use of piezo coaxial cable for
perimeter security, strung on fencing as a microphone
and also buried underground, which then can register &
record raindrops, footsteps, people climbing fence, etc.)

@_subject: energy harvesting via PVDF - (02) 
okay, so the big surprise for me was that this piezo film
technology lines up directly with an energy harvesting
article from a recent (urls) list. excerpted again below:

@_date: 2013-12-19 16:34:01
@_author: brian carroll 
@_subject: PVDF as antenna - (03) 
from this vantage of not-knowing, and having experimented
some with breadboards and the Parallax Basic Stamp
microcontroller platform, it would again seem possible
that if the PVDF were conceptualized as an antenna that
when it is geometrically aligned does not just access a
realm of signals, and instead, this signal is itself energy
that correlates directly with a capturing of voltage within
the piezo film as capacitor, such that an 'energy antenna'
exists and perhaps this is the basis of energy harvesting,
though seemingly is bounded by how it is implemented.
in that its application appears to be requiring mechanical
energy, affixed to a surface which bends the material as
the basis for vibration, than tuning into a frequency that
is detached from the sensor and yet resonates it via the
correspondence and alignment of shared tuning (A=A),
and in this way motivates charge within a larger circuit.
so there are whitepapers that exist about self-sustaining
circuits based on PVDF and microcontrollers [0] and yet
nothing in this other realm about the 'global AC circuit' [1]
as this could also influence movement of the antenna in a
framework beyond that of sidewalks and HVAC vibrations.
in that atmospheric electricity and the earth-ionosphere
cavity [2] have fundamental relation to EM technologies
thus, stating the obvious in an expanded view beyond
that of a compartmentalized realm, this condition of being
within such an environment, yet not having it understood
or conceptualized based upon a false limit or no-go zone,
as if fringe to consider or perhaps not obvious to those
without instruction, the educational system enforcing a
fundamental disconnection, as if to keep everything that
is naturally connected apart, as if somehow beyond limits
thus basic electromagnetic awareness, to then read the
technical manual [3] where it states the following:
"Although the forces involved are small, the film can be used to
excite other mechanical structures over a very wide frequency range.
If a second element of film is used to receive the induced vibration,
the system can possess a very high dynamic range, even though the
overall "insertion loss" due to the film is about -66 dB typically for
a structure at resonance. If sufficient gain is applied between these
elements, the structure will self-oscillate at its natural frequency.
For these resonant mechanical systems, high voltage drive is not
required. The amplifier circuit may function adequately from a normal
dual rail op-amp supply, or even from a single 9 volt battery. For
analysis purposes, even lower applied voltages, e.g., the noise source
of a spectrum analyzer at 70 mVrms, are sufficient to insert the
mechanical energy into a structure when piezo film is also used to
monitor the result." (p.5)
now consider again the issue of tuning and shared resonance,
that the movement of one object at a certain vibration/frequency
could induce another object to also vibrate at that frequency if
the resonance was shared or tuned similarly.
thus, a PVDF film 'transmitting antenna' could seemingly generate
a vibration at a given frequency, and if matched to anther PVDF film
as receiving antenna, could induce it to vibrate and in effect, transfer
or transmit the power from one circuit into another, via this vibration.
i.e. resonance-based transfer of energy, or remote power generation
so you could place a microcontroller antenna tuned to a frequency
a few feet from another, on a separate circuit, and seemingly then
light up its LEDs via vibrational energy, no electromagnetism that
spans this gap, and instead resonance or vibration as the medium.
(note: non-acoustic seemingly because it is the material itself that
is vibrating and not "acoustic" air pressure pushing it to vibrate.)
note: in this way it is clean, non-pollutive, and nonradiating energy
and this is what Tesla had discovered apparently, and yet it was not
able to be developed further, given the all-encompassing situation.
and yet, listening to the stories of hh, she conveys that Tesla who
had developed alternating current infrastructure thought in retrospect
that it was unnatural and harmful as an energy approach, and that
this resonance-based energy was based upon natural cosmic order,
and was correctly aligned with life and nature, not functioning against
it via invisible toxic pollution of radiation and its massive inefficiencies.
so now there are two major themes: one is energy capture via the
Schumann Resonance, and another is non-electromagnetic transfer
of power via antennas tuned to a shared frequency, whereby current
from one circuit could induce it in another. this is different from the
magnetic induction whereby magnetic fields bridge the gap between
transmitter and receiving device, and any electric or electromagnetic
version likewise, whereby current is bridging this gap, ionizing the
air inbetween, breaking down the structure of the air to move energy,
versus nontoxic vibrating at some imperceptible infrastructural layer
that is already active within nature, which all entities are attuned to
as part of a living ecosystem and circuit, yet also out of harmony and
out of balance via technology and development in the present moment,
with populations unable to grasp the hostile situation we exist within,
environmentally, ecologically, educationally, intellectually, realistically
in the dimensions & parameters that exist, for optimal decision-making
what then if the approach or conceptualization is off, and equipment
and tools exist for experimentation like early days of electrification,
where hobbyists can turn inventors and transform the situation by
exploring beyond the edge already defined, via new interpretations
or accessing old, discarded ideas and knowledge, thinking it through
once again, and perhaps massive discoveries await via such experiment

@_subject: tuning piezo antenna - (4) 
basically at this juncture there are questions of piezo film itself,
and then how to control this within a circuit, which could also
involve information transfer, and thus microcontroller platforms
are probably involved in such experimentation and development.
so how i approach this situation is that i look at what is available
for piezo film sensors, and contemplate how that plastic-coated
piezo film could be made to vibrate automatically or function as
a non-radiating transceiver of 'resonance-based' energy as signal.
and thus the options are basically for little rectangle tabs of film
that plug into a breadboard circuit of a microcontroller or else can
be soldered to a circuitboard, as with various other approaches. [0]
e.g. the DT Series from Measurement Specialties is the same type
of strain-gage sensor found in contact microphones. [1] though i was
still completely puzzled by another version of this element that has
a round metal opening in its otherwise flat surface as if a mistake
occurred at the hardware store. as if a pierced PVDF sensor. [2]
and then after a google search i happened upon a experimenter
who built an Arduino Seismic Activity Monitor [3] using the same
PVDF element and it was then realized the hole in the piezo tab
related to its use as a cantilever that vibrates and that additional
weights can be added to limit what frequencies influence it, thus
the antenna can be tuned to respond to only certain frequencies,
or in the larger consideration, potentially to resonate in a narrow
window where it could be specifically tuned to, say- 7.83 Hz, if
indeed it either could be manufactured this way as an antenna
or retrofitted via weights or modifications. or so it seems possible.
in other words, having once had access to a seismic sensor, the
range in which the vibrations would trigger the circuit could be
fine-tuned to a certain limited parameter which could potentially
influence inefficiency or limit any outside involvement, harmonics
from powerlines or ambient noise that could lessen or disrupt the
clean or predominant movement, seemingly. like only having one
vibration versus several that counteract and diminish one another,
though perhaps in some cases harmonics could be beneficial and
in others counteract the movement. those who know would know.
(sidenote: interesting to consider precisely because such a sensor
can still be used as a microphone element and could be tuned or
adjusted to pick up stray signals or vibrations from the environment,
say the 60 cycle hum of alternating current, more on this later..)
so, tuning of the adjustable PVDF film tab apparently involves
either guesswork or use of an oscilloscope, which i wish i knew
how to use because it seems the conceptual foundation of the
diagnostics of electronics and circuits, how to relate to and
understand them in detail and without it, the multimeter in its
non-graphic approach remains to me an issue of numbers only,
never having understood how all of it fits together as a worldview.
though it is evident that it is possible to put weights onto this
cantilever of the sensor and then measure it so that it only can
vibrate within a certain wavelength, or frequency, in this case it
was bounded for earthquake sensing, to a lower range and thus
filtering out all the higher frequencies that could influence if not
trigger the sensor, said to be extremely sensitive to vibrations,
otherwise. what this amounts to is: if you know electronics and
know circuits and have an oscilloscope, you could probably tune
the antenna to a particular frequency range, whether to transmit
or receive crypto data as infrasound (seems unlikely as transmit,
though receive apparently a-ok, if material connection is vibration,
again not acoustic or in air; thus computer chassis, cables, etc)
or at ultrahigh frequencies (transmit/receive seemingly both ok.)
thus perhaps someone with the know-how to see if it is actually
possible to transmit data via resonance-based vibration, where
movement is induced in another circuit, becoming power for that
circuit, else also transmit data via non-electromagnetic means,
on the principle of shared tuning. (there is more to this, opening
up and tapping into the infinity of a circuit, and somehow having
this drive the vibration of the PVDF ((which is more 'the aether'
from what i understand, not of this dimensionality)) though that
is for some other investigation, in some other time and place.
this involves challenging existing mathematics of zero, etc.)
in any case, the point here is that there could be multiple ways
of tuning the piezo film as an antenna within these parameters,
and it could involve differing approaches or circuits to do so.

@_subject: PVDF & microcontrollers - (5) 
it is already established my skills do not allow exploration of
these issues though i have some basic observations to share
about what exists based on web searches that may quicken
research for those interested who are new to PVDF sensors.
first observation is that a development kit exists for those who
have knowledge and interest and want to start experimenting,
[0] though it does not appear to include cantilever hole designs
of the sensor, that was mentioned in terms of tuning antennas.
still, it could be useful for exfiltrating data or capturing signals
sent via infra- or ultrasound, and also has a large film element
that has been used as a speaker in various online demos. for
instance, seemingly you could wire up a PVDF sensor along-
side computer chassis and monitor signals via its vibrations,
or powersupply, perhaps keyboard or keystrokes or whatnot.
likewise, power various tools via energy harvesting of these
same approaches else discover free-energy approach based
in shared resonance not coupled to another material beyond
the antenna itself if tuned to a primary and matched source.
it seems Arduino and other microcontroller platforms are for
those already saavy in programming and they and other such
programmable integrated circuit platforms represent a large
population of developers, professionals, experimenters, and
hobbyists, and other enthusiasts. this seems equivalent in
kind to the early era of electronics with crystal radio kits
occurring in an engineering centric culture that grew into
the early computer industry via ham radio experimenters,
and those who mail ordered and constructed electronic kits,
today involving the internet, online stores, discussion boards
in the realm of advanced computing, everyone having their
own programmable 'computer-based' development platform,
and a tremendous kit of parts to choose from, to further explore.
including ideas, goals, projects, hypotheses, prototypes, etc.
the reason for stating this is that a certain level of literacy may
exist for many who are computer literate in the advanced sense
of a cypherpunks context, knowing hardware and software and
ideas beyond this, into mathematics and linguistic concepts,
and so a high-fidelity understanding and awareness may exist
that enables greater ease of use within the ready-to-program
devices that have limited documentation, and can present a
large learning curve for those starting without such experience.
thus, straight-away to mention that Sparkfun [1] carries various
PVDF sensors, example, that can then be added into whatever
microcontroller may exist capable of interfacing with the sensor.
the thing is, in researching this, it appears there is potentially
limited data for people just starting out, for how to go about this,
whereas those already fluent may know how to put it all together.
apparently instructions can be lacking and this is mentioned with
respect to another approach for those like myself who need more
step-by-step instructions and learning tutorials to know what to
do and how to think about things, to build up awareness via
making circuits on the microcontroller versus using it for an
already determined objective. and there are general kits to do
this for Arduino, in particular a 37 module sensor kit [2], so it
is potentially an experimenter's paradise, if knowing how to get
everything functioning, having a plan and enough information.
i do not know enough about Arduino to know other competitors
in the same domain though it appears there are many others
(Beagleboard, etc) so that was used just as an example of
several different options that exist where these piezo sensors
can be integrated into the existing programmable platform,
to custom-build and craft circuits, as is already being done.
(note: if i am using 'platform' in the wrong way, my apologies,
it is the nearest word i know of to describe these tools)
so essentially it is a 'nothing new here' situation for those who
know all about this technology, though potentially to question
the potential for a piezo film sensor beyond existing boundaries
and perhaps for advanced unmentioned cryptologic applications.
the issue then is to question an electronic component, this
piezo film tab as vibrational cantilever, the piezo element that
exists beyond the circular disk and functions in other territory
and in other configurations, including also piezo coaxial cable
(and again, its potential use as an antenna of other dynamics)
and so, for instance, the datasheets are included on some of
the urls below, to provide more information if interested in
evaluating if the given parameters may allow experimentation
within the realms considered, say detecting signals patterns
via vibrational 'contact' versus acoustic microphone. [3]
so that is perhaps the majority approach for those already
up to speed, though everyone may not have the same approach
or others may want to learn about this, and thus a programmable
microcontroller platform I have successfully learned from before,
both about electronics and software programming of breadboard
circuits is the Parallax BASIC Stamp Activity Kit [4]. essentially
it is a platform for educating people about microcontrollers and
provides an indepth tutorial and various circuits as part of a kit,
and support forums for experimenters and developers, as with
Arduino, which may have its own 'learn electronics' kit, though
it seems Parallax has focused on this educational sector and
providing materials for schoolchildren, hobbyists, and up, to the
professional sector prototyping and development solutions, so
is perhaps unique in its tutorial or hands-on learning approach
versus what may require additional instruction else a different
more self-guided approach otherwise, with other pathways.
(trying to be fair, not advertise, yet also provide information
about the offerings. also: if other PVDF vendors, they are few
or do not have information i could locate in repeated searches)
this is why I mention the Parallax kit that includes a fundamental
course in learning circuits via a programmable breadboard. this
same PVDF sensor [5] can be used with this platform, and it
also has additional data on the commands related to it as part
of a User Guide for that specific tutorial approach, [6] in that it
may provide more structure than other less structured approaches
though perhaps this is more related to the overall framework of
learning to use a microcontroller itself, where for some a more
all encompassing approach may be required prior to interfacing
with the PVDF in terms of programming functioning of a circuit.
and likewise, following this same general theme, the Sensors
Sampler Pack for the Parallax BASIC Stamp microcontroller
includes a PVDF element along with other sensor options. [7]
the reason for providing examples is to see what is out there
for those learning, in individual components and then within an
integrated approach, of which there are various routes to take.
for instance, consider the following project:
Phoenix Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor Project
Sub-project: Piezo Film Pulse Sensor
if someone already knows what they are doing, competent in
the domains of hardware and microcontroller programming, it
would probably be fairly likely they could replicate or learn from
this demonstration of use for a PVDF sensor. yet further, someone
with an interest in cryptography or crytanalysis, could potentially
take this same information and apply the pulse reading to the
chassis of a computer to monitor vibrational activity or apply
this same information in some other way, in terms of security
analysis, exploits, defense, research, exploration, experiment.
though someone who does not have this knowledge then may
be stuck, unless a step-by-step approach exists, which is more
the Parallax approach, and perhaps in some ways Arduinio if
online tutorials exist in place of paper manuals, though these
extra layers of information may be required prior to achieving
such finished projects, and needs to be built-up as a skill first.
but not everything that is involved in this situation is about
technology of computer hardware and software, and the code
can go beyond computing, even 'electrons' potentially, in terms
of what the situation could be modeled as, via its parameters.
in that the PVDF as tunable antenna is not unlike a tuning fork
that is made to resonate by another paired vibration, and while
it may appear this is acoustic energy, air pressure, it could be
the resonance of the material itself that is set to vibrate due to
its physics, its particular construction and composition. that is,
as with Helen Hall and her study of music physics, that what
this involves relates to the issue of a vibrating string, and the
'energy' issues of vibration can be conceptualized likewise in
terms of music principles, such that the resonance as it now
is conceived of may not exist within computing in the way it
is known in music, for instance, yet it may have importance
in terms of harvesting energy via non-acoustic vibrations.
i do not myself understand what this involves enough to better
introduce to topic, though to hh it is 'the Art of Frequencies',
as this relates to music physics and music and energy. the
reason it is mentioned is that sympathetic vibrations occur
in a paired matching or alignment (1:1) and (A=A) in terms
of logic, within my own research, and in this way especially
in terms of 'consciousness', each person their own antenna,
and how they relate to others and in what ways. a common
example could be sexual dynamics and 'magnetic fields', in
that a certain pressure or boundary may be encountered via
anther that either attracts or repels or is perhaps neutral. in
this framework, there is something tied into the materiality
of encounter, the physical body and its relation to another,
other as self or unlike self, as this constitutes circuitry.
further, though, beyond or outside a realm of push & pull
of both magnetic and electromagnetic polarity, it also can
potentially include something 'outside' this EM boundary,
in that a non-electromagnetic energy of vibration could
also exist -- as if in the realm of information itself -- that
maps onto these same connections as 'shared tuning'
(all mention of tuning has origin with HH, in my work).
so what this is to suggest is that this inductive sensing
of humans, this mapping of awareness of self and others,
could be occurring as information in this vibrational way,
if connecting 'dots' across various views and approaches,
and thus how people are tuned or out of tune may relate
to what signals they pick up or what movements they are
part of, as grounded within certain dimensions, dynamics,
self as circuit, then relation with others into groups, etc.
and this is also the PVDF antenna model, seemingly.
potentially. the only substitution i would suggest is that
that 'global electrical current' that could set everything into
a shared time and framework of connected circuitry, would
be in some sense an analogy of empirical truth that flows
into the shared macrocircuit and people are aligned by it.
thus, induction beyond electromagnetism, though also
as a pressure, perhaps, the pneumatic aspect, and the
larger cosmological question of 'strings' that may be of
an informational category, in terms of cosmic vibration
that is defined by resonance of each and every object,
if not mistaken in relaying others knowledge involved.
in other words, consciousness could be modeled by
this circuit in terms of information transfer as it also
could have an energetic component yet this approach
could exist outside or beyond the current conception
of the body in both nonexistent electromagnetic terms
and also, non-existence non-electromagnetic terms
functioning outside this electromagnetic framework,
in the sense that aetheric order could exist beneath
the existing dimensional space, this described as a
vortex model of the atom, as it relates to zero. [8]
so the potential, should a vibration on an antenna
transform into harnessing free energy - via resonance
and this new PVDF film sensor technology - then its
significance is also conceptual, beyond perhaps the
issues of creating a vibrating cantilever or pendulum
in a watch that removes the need for a battery or for
winding, due to being tuned to frequency of the earth
that becomes part of its circuit, its power source, via
this connectivity based upon natural order, its circuit
as ecosystem and habitat, context for technology.
and how this moves into modeling of self as a being,
an entity, modeling of information in relation to energy
and matter, in terms of music and physics principles,
and how it recontextualizes questions and parameters
were it to be unlocked as a common framework within
which people relate or decide to disallow its existence
i only saw the first two parts of Atlas Shrugged, a recent
television movie version, never having read the longer book
by Ayn Rand, though it seems to be based upon this same
premise, where another world exists outside the ordinary
realm, having cracked open the threshold allowing access
to other dimensionality. the third part of the film is to be
released in the next summer, apparently. in any case,
interesting times ahead if this is indeed possible...

@_subject: PVDF strategies - (06) 
a general situation and condition has been described,
relating piezo film (PVDF) with issues of free energy
and also 'non-electromagnetic' if not 'non-acoustic'
transfer of power and perhaps information likewise.
yet there is a problem encountered as mentioned,
regarding challenges to achieving an ~8 Hz vibration
at the given scale, which may be an issue connected
with do-it-yourself approaches versus a manufacturing
approach, and the technological tools and equipment
available to investigate these dynamics at the scale
of breadboards, microcontrollers, and PVDF elements.
can the existing 'size' of an PVDF electronic component
actually register the approximate ~8 Hz vibration of the
Schumann resonance?
from what i have read in the technical manual (p.2), the
piezo film material is capable of registering vibration at
this frequency [1] and in fact is so sensitive in its use
as in contact microphone applications that shielding is
required to reduce unwanted vibrations [2] in a context
of 'vibration sensing' which also applies when attached
to music instruments [3]. with this in mind, it appears
that the PVDF film element is hypersensitive to any
vibration depending on the surface it is attached to.
in other words, if there is an ~8 Hz vibration occurring,
it would seem likely if not probable that the PVDF film
tab is potentially capable of sending it, given enough
knowledge and whatever equipment required to do so.
so enough of the hypotheticals, i may have forgotten
to emphasize if not mention an important observation.
several weeks ago there was an (urls) list sent that
had information about a NOVA science program that
just aired on Public Television (PBS) in the U.S. and
i saw the last 20 minutes or so of that show, as was
conveyed on that post. [4] [5] the expert interviewed
for the program, Earle R. Williams [6] mentioned the
Global AC Circuit and described research occurring
in a rural Rhode Island experiment that has been
studying this for decades, based on groundbreaking
ideas of a previous researcher who pioneered the field
of atmospheric electricity.
and what Mr. Williams said and demonstrated in this
interview was astonishing to hear. basically, if memory
serves: any antenna on earth picks up this frequency
of the Schumann resonance, which he said was ~8 Hz.
(presumably equates to 'metal antennas' i am guessing,
of the kind found on radios and televisions.)
the very interesting aspect about this, 'context' as it were,
is that this research hut for atmospheric electricity was
old technology -- basically an antenna in a very remote area
to minimize electromagnetic interference (EMI) from what is
the buzzing infrastructure of wired and wireless civilization.
the other aspect is that Mr. Williams stated, if remembering,
that all that is needed is an antenna and oscilloscope to
verify the signal is there. meaning: get a metal antenna,
have it grounded or whatever is necessary, and then attach
it to a visual feedback system and locate the 8 Hz signal.
"spikes" that occur within the signal, atop the frequency
of the Schumann resonance, are lightning strikes. as if
the earth-ionosphere cavity may have some aspect of an
echo chamber (my phrasing), though also it was stated,
again, if remembering correctly, that lighting strikes can
travel up to 2.5 times around the earth, which feeds this
resonance and supports and sustains this wavelength
that is vibrating on all antennas everywhere the same.
so in some sense these are clues, signs of what exists,
what the parameters are. people who know how to use
an oscilloscope and basic antenna are that much closer
to the issue than those who do not, and likewise, those
who can program a microcontroller and write code, etc.
so incorporating this as additional information into the
existing approach and ideas, along with helpful feedback
that questions the starting investigation in its parameters,
it seems possible that experimentation could begin within
a PVDF film sensor context, if having the tools, technology,
and ideas to shape and evaluate and test these conditions.
though further, it is also probable that specifically designing
a PVDF sensor for this particular application would be the
more direct investigation. both approaches could be viable.
in other words, the as-is approach relying on existing
piezo sensors could yield some interesting and unexpected
discoveries, and perhaps break this open into another realm.
and so how to do that is a question: how to tune the element,
how to approach it, what are the actual issues involved, etc.
for instance, consider the PVDF film itself as a rectangle
that can register vibrations via touching a vibrating surface;
this versus having the PVDF film itself resonate, vibrating
based on its being a quasi free-standing antenna. these
different approaches both could potentially access 8 Hz
though via different strategies and frameworks.
my assumption is is that rectangle of the sensor itself
is capable of picking up 'multiple frequencies' at a given
time, depending on what exists as a signal. and thus, if
in a musical approach, it may have 'multiple tunings' even
that coexist on the vibrating surface, whether freestanding
or registering movement from an attached vibrating surface.
and so the issue can be of filtering these signals to focus
the sensor into a given range. and how this is done could
effect its 'efficiency' in terms of energy collection, because
a stronger versus weaker signal could exist, if muddled by
others that counteract its pendulum-like wave movement. if
this way, dampening of the vibration via weights may allow
no movement in certain frequencies, whereas a software
filter could only edit them out while they still exist as an
active force, perhaps removing energy from or competing
with a given frequency or signal from the wanted range.\
so capturing different frequencies simultaneously (good
for crypto and energy harvesting, perhaps) vs. focusing on
a given range (better for Schumann resonance seemingly)
and yet here's the thing--
like a drum skin, how is this elusive jabberwocky of the
Schumann resonance of ~8 Hz ever going to be accessed
if it cannot be readily encountered. what can capture that
wave vibration, at that particular very long wavelength. and
(due to no memory, i get to ask such rhetorical questions)
this is what triggered my memory about the antennas, that
all antennas vibrate at this frequency, or so the expert said.
though also, considering the drum approach, this then got
me thinking- instead of a free standing 'energy antenna',
would it not be possible to use a PVDF sensor to measure
and also pick up this 8 Hz vibration on an antenna instead?
in that if the antenna is vibrating at 8 Hz, could this vibration
be 'harvested' and establish mechanical vibration in these
highly sensitive piezo films, to then build up AC current in
via their capacitance, building up and storing this charge...
in other words: PVDF + ~8 Hz antenna freq. => energy
if there were no limits to exploration and equipment could
be used to custom manufacture prototypes for this purpose,
what would an antenna look like that vibrates only at this
targeted frequency... and thus, another strategy could
involve custom manufacture of the piezo film element,
such that its surface has an antenna etched onto it,
that is made to vibrate at the Schumann resonance,
for instance a particular geometry, grid, array, pattern.
i have read about antennas and they are based upon
geometric proportion to the wavelength, so 'size' does
not necessarily correlate to frequency in terms of larger
antennas for bigger wavelengths, (if i am not mistaken).
instead, the issue of alignment between a signal and
an antenna involves a matched or paired geometrical
structure that can effectively map signals onto antennas
and then coherently deliver this signal into a circuit. likely
as cleanly and crisply as is possible, mathematics then
determining these models and design approaches. thus,
fractal antennas are an area where 'scale' is exampled
other than a yagi or dipole. and cellphones in particular
appear to make very tiny antennas or utilize unique
approaches to make them invisible even, via how the
device is grounded and where the wires are hidden,
perhaps related to signal strength and also 'length'.
so in some sense, maybe size and scale do matter
and in some sense maybe size and scale are not the
most critical factors in given applications. maybe a
larger power source requires a larger antenna and
smaller applications only need smaller antennas.
what i want to convey is that this 'etched on' approach
where an antenna structure could be engineered onto
the piezo film surface -- (such that it would vibrate at
the given frequency and then stress the sensor, in
turn generating power via its constant movement) --
has correlation with a circuit - perhaps soldertrace,
that is the antenna. so imagine a rectangle with a
single loop of a given geometry that would somehow
function as a single-frequency antenna and vibrate,
and thus stress/strain, compression/decompression
of that metal structure would flex the piezo film that
it is attached to, and be designed to maximize the
surface area with this specific tuned geometry that
can focus in on just those signals or vibrations, as
simple as an anode and cathode attached to it, yet
if correlating other approaches, perhaps etched to
a nanosurface-level with fractal patterns even that
could maximize voltage, if possible, or increase
capacitance or whatever else may be optimized
for energy harvesting of ~8 Hz signal vibrations.
so, to simplify, imagine 'the cantilever' that is the
concept already for the piezo film tab, a rectangle
that moves back and forth on axis, and in doing so
creates and stores charge that then can be dumped
into a circuit, bit by bit if momentary, and seemingly
constant alternating current if the signal is constant.
the additional etched pattern atop the sensor, this
being an additional layer, could be considered 'the
antenna' for accessing Schumann resonance. yet,
it could also be conceptualized as a cantilever that
is in addition to the piezo device itself, also this.
my vagueness here is not intentional, trying to write
into a particular direction and context whereby this
'tuned antenna' atop a cantilever instead becomes
this cantilever via a different manufacturing process,
whereby the PVDF device is itself tuned to ~8 Hz,
& moreso, perhaps taking on the form of cantilever.
such that, the piezo elemen becomes a tuning fork
that is tuned for this specific vibrational frequency,
and then anode/cathode, into associated circuitry
precedent, and note 'the scale' here, is with MEMs
devices and micromachines and nanoscale devices
where such extreme miniature 'antennas' can already
be constructed and vibrate at known frequencies, and
they take on the form of a cantilever (same functioning
as energy harvesting sensors, as vibrating pendulums)
and thus micro and nano radios can be made and
other devices, where under microscope a furious
activity is observed of what is basically a tuning fork
that is naturally vibrating via its 'tuned resonance',
(if not mistaken in interpretation of these events).
so at this unobservable visual scale, little cantilevers
can be made to vibrate via their tuning, and function
essentially the same as cantilevers that at this scale
are not envisioned or conceptualized to auto-vibrate
via paired resonance. why is that i wonder, (embargo
on thoughts, experiment, or secret domain perhaps)
just consider a watch, the mechanisms required to
wind and keep the watch spinning its intricate gears,
as this relates to pendulum movement. now what if
a cantilever existed that could vibrate automatically
at ~8 Hz, and thus no more batteries, solar cell, nor
wind-up mechanisms would be needed to provide the
motive power need for its clockwork movement. and
in this way, likewise- the cantilever is the antenna.
the concept of the sensor as mechanical cantilever
in its multiuse form, instead being reimagined as a
tuned rectangle with additional layer of antenna, this
as cantilever, or further, no rectangle and instead the
PVDF is made into a cantilever, tuning fork vibrating
at the frequency of the Schumann resonance, and in
this way, potentially replacing batteries given the size
of the cantilever and its effectiveness or efficiency.
another way to consider this in terms of electronics
and circuits is the (radio again) crystal oscillator that
is included as a stand-alone timing device, matched to
a particular frequency, lets say ~8 Hz for example...
as i understand it, electrical current in a circuit - say
involving resistors, capacitors, relays, switches, and
wires on a prototyping breadboard - moves throughout
this maze of components and can send electrons into
the crystal oscillator, a timing device, that is activated
by this electricity and generates a particular frequency
in response to its being electrified, formatting resulting
output as a given frequency, here 8 Hz, back into the
circuit, where it could be used say by an IC chip that
uses it to count cycles that trigger other activity, say
an LED display that moves up a number every million
cycles and continually counts 0-9 and starts over again.
so the idea here is that this electronics component is
partly doing what the PVDF sensor is, only in reverse.
what the crystal "quartz" oscillator does is vibrate at
a particular frequency (~8 Hz) which is the goal, and
this is already achieved in a device related in some
way already to piezo sensors (see: quartz). the main
difference is that it requires external energy to generate
the signal or the vibrations, (though if it were tuned to
~8 hz, might it vibrate without any external power?)...
     energy (in) ==> crystal oscillator ==> 8 Hz vibration (out)
to put it another way, in terms of active concepts...
     electricity ==> vibration ==> timing
in other words, in traditional radio or other timing circuits
reliant upon crystal oscillators, electrical current (power)
is input into the component that then "vibrates" at a given
frequency, and then this signal is output as 'time' into the
circuit, whereby the electrical current has this geometric
patterning mapped into its structure which is then utilized
by related or connected components, to format other action.
what the piezo film sensor does is exactly the opposite:
    timing ==> vibration ==> electricity
it takes some regular mechanical vibration when attached
to a surface, and this vibration strains the sensor which in
turn generates electrical charge via piezo electric properties
and then stores this charge via its capacitance, which then
can be output into the connected circuitry as AC electrical
current. the main issue appears to focus upon controlling
the timing or frequency, via TUNING the device (that is,
creating a cantilever or antenna to automatically vibrate)
in other words, if the 'timing' between the PVDF or other
piezo sensor and the Schumann resonance could be
established, matched in shared resonance (A=A) such
that the 8 Hz signal would directly map to an antenna
or cantilever structure tuned specifically for 8 Hz, then:
    matched-timing ==> perpetual vibration ==> free electricity
where 'matched-timing' is pairing of signal with antenna
of the piezo sensor (cantilever or not) in that the geometry
is aligned (A=A) which then accesses and sustains this
connection of 8 Hz vibration via 'shared resonance' that is
a transfer of energy from the earth/ionosphere cavity, to
the surface of the earth. the critical issue appears to be
~adjustable tuning of an antenna to allow for drift, such
that "tuning" differences both small (Aa=Ab) and large
(A=B) can be adjusted for, which also occurs in a realm
of electronics and watchmaking, if not mistaken, that an
additional level of fine-tuning and adjustkbility is involved
and required in such intricate small scale technological
if other ecosystems, because variances may exist/persist
does this mean also that a crystal oscillator [7] is a step
or two away from providing power to a circuit if only tuned
to ~8 Hz - it would probably involve whatever piezo aspect
of crystals, if they could output current as piezo sensors,
when vibrating at this frequency, thus an issue of locating
or manufacturing such crystals, tuning them as antennas.
(should Superman be mentioned here, or metaphysics of
crystals, predecessor to electronics, original components
of nature, such that this is the foundation of the study, in
this way, so too amber and lodestone, known or unknown)
the key idea then is of tuning piezos, whereby the piezo
element is itself the antenna, and this could be explored
in various ways, etched onto the surface of an existing
sensor element, such as with PVDF film tabs, or made
into a cantilever such as a tuning fork vibrating at ~8 Hz
that outputs energy into a self via its perpetual motion,
and further, crystal oscillators tuned to this frequency
of the Schumann resonance, if capable of generating or
outputting electricity via alignment with this frequency,
tuned into it in terms of energy harvesting versus timing
for circuits or for receiving or transmitting radio waves.
note: again, this is non-electromagnetic vibration that
is accessed, so oscillators and piezos are functioning
in an undescribed realm at macroscale, though within
effects _known within music (as natural philosophy),
described by composer/filmmaker Helen Hall. [8]
the mythos involved includes a realm of the forbidden
and of the fringe activity of outlawed energy research,
access to 'free energy' that is believed to have earlier
been accessed on earth by its inhabitants yet since
disappeared within civilization, vanished along with
its cosmology (of the aether), the plenum seemingly,
edited out, removed from view via Michelson-Morley.
and yet the idea of limitless energy, locating it as if an
issue of dousing within the electromagnetic framework
with various strange machines and contraptions, those
seeking to tap into it, upon relating to and realizing its
mystery that surrounds, encompasses, defines and yet
cannot be tangibly defined in these same terms it exists
because the basic model and approach are off, and just
enough to send things in another direction, still unaware
in other words, there is potential energy all around, the
issues of dead cellphones after 5 hours moot should a
small cantilever antenna find geometrical alignment that
replaces its power source with one non-electromagnetic,
non-polluting, attuned to nature and mind, in harmony
and related to the larger order, not existing to destroy it.
how to tap into it, where is it. how do you get there if
electromagnetism is off-limits to investigation beyond
an ideology of a protective technological priesthood.
and then, how to imagine beyond electromagnetism
if concepts are not understanding of this condition
firstly, to realize what the encountered issues are,
so that reasoning is possible in a shared framework
the larger question, how to tap into the infinity that is
within the electromagnetic circuit, open up that seam
between zero and infinity, and use it to turn things at
higher speeds and momentums or with greater force,
limitless power of any magnitude, seemingly. this is
essentially to break out of relativity and back into a
non-warped model of nature, so anti-gravity and other
such issues are basic and easy to advance beyond,
though if living within lies of a false perspective this is
not possible. so the worldview has to be taken down
before any landspeeders are going to arrive in town
0. The 8 Hertz approximation was used by an expert on
this issue, which is an easy round number to recall that
stands-in for whatever the exact decimal place resonance
may be for hooking up to the Schumann resonance. This

heading down the final stretch...
my fascination with sensors as an electronics concept
began with small pamphlet electronics instruction books
from Forrest Mims [0] found Shack though they
are widely available online these days. [1]  if interested
in programming microcontrollers though have not been
introduced via non-computer breadboard electronics, it
may be of interest to look at and learn from circuits in
these notebooks, which provide basic concepts for how
the circuits work and the principles they involve. for a
technical person it could be instructive, for those like
myself with a mental gap in the fundamentals there
may still be questions that need to be answered
before able to access and intuitively understand
exactly what is going on, modifying it from there
so, engineering mindset, great resource. artistic
mindset, perhaps still a significant boundary before
understanding though i have trouble with reading and
ambiguous concepts so it could be only my limitation
that kept me from learning the basics of electronics
in terms of circuitry. another is: having the parts that
are needed, versus just looking at the diagrams and
understanding what is happening, or using these for
reference, to build other circuits via same approach
or extending or borrowing certain parts of designs.
quite interesting to locate a Mims book on sensors
and piezo kit together in regard to ongoing issues
with piezo sensors and energy harvesting. [2]
what captured my imagination was the particular
notebook on sensors, their conceptual nature as
this relates to issues of feedback and intelligence
that effectively maps onto switches and gauges
as measurements of activity, indicators of events;
likewise, the reversibility of sensors, how some if
not many can be inverted in their functioning, such
that a microphone can be a speaker and vice versa
PVDF piezo film as a sensor material exemplifies
the tremendous range that a given material and its
properties can connect with, in varying dynamics
and dimensions. (if not mistaken, it can even detect
airflow while potentially creating air flow likewise)
and so one of these unique properties of piezo film
is that it can detect temperature differences. this
got me wondering (reading of its application in the
tech manual), that given its incredible sensitivity,
would it be able to detect electromagnetic fields
due to the gradiated change in radiation levels
surrounding wires, in proximity to EMF signals
this combined with the idea of the PVDF sensor
as an ANTENNA then had me wondering if this
could function in a similar realm as the standard
linear Hall effect sensor [3] that senses magnetic
fields and functions as a strain gage (analog) or
on/off switch (binary/digital) in the presence of
electromagnetic fields. and thus EMF meters,
most presumably, utilized Hall effect sensors
that have multiple axes, 1-axis to 3-axis that
relate to the geometry of the EM field in space,
and thus rotating a probe for an EMF meter in
a given context which generate varying signal,
helping define the shape and direction of the
signal, as it is positioned in space [4] [5]
so my thinking was as follows... there are these
small piezo sensor 'film tabs' that can be hooked
up to a speaker, and if they could detect signals
from home wiring in the wall, as a microphone,
then essentially it approximates an EMF meter
without the display details, though could indicate
an intensity level by how loud or soft the noise
that is picked up. perhaps this is actually not
possible though it my questioning of its use.
and this could require holding or moving the
piezo film tab, the rectangle with an audio
cable connected to it, then connected with a
small preamp/mixer, amplifier or headphones,
and perhaps moving it along the wall -- which
seems unlikely due to sensitivity -- because it
would generate massive noise seemingly, or,
to potentially move it in the air, likewise that
could seemingly make lots of noise by its
movement, masking any other signals.
it seems to go nowhere as an approach,
yet my question remains that if this PVDF
material can and does function as an antenna
and it could pick up signals via vibrations, that
perhaps if it was held or moved against a wall
with electrical wiring inside, it could access
this intense vibrational activity in some way
it is obviously unclear as an approach, as
multiple aspects coincide, both in attempting
to access a signal and how this could occur...
and thus: the issue could be having the PVDF
film tab register 'temperature variation' as a way
to monitor the difference in heat between a less
electromagnetic realm and more electromagnetic
realm as the radiation is monitored by the sensor
and is this possible or not. and further, would the
fact that the device is a capacitor then influence
its charge via induction, such that the EMFs
would charge the PVDF film, again via vibration
or heat, though which could be used as electricity
in a circuit it connects to, via energy harvesting.
the concept is that the EMF meter as device
would generate power when detecting signals.
and so the existing rectangular film tabs [6] are
potentially one way of going about this, in terms
of 'mapping temperature' as mapping of EMFs,
and seemingly related to this is the issue of the
sensor being shielded or not, as this potentially
relates to issues of tuning. what frequency or
temperature range can influence the sensor
a hypothetical application the PVDF sensor
used for mapping out EMFs, is that a cellphone
could contain such a device and be held against
the wall or on a shelf in which there is electrical
wiring, and the induction that occurs from the
wires to the capacitor via vibration of EMFs
could in effect provide charging power to the
cellphone or other once-battery-reliant device,
if energy harvesting was paired with wiring in
the home and electrical power already in place,
it would be an issue of locating it, excavating
a hidden environment, so the EMF meter as
indicator of signal strength or of radiation levels
as temperature could provide a diagnostic of a
local area via mapping it out as EM environment,
and then situate devices in this specific location,
in proximity to wires to maximize energy harvest
via vibration that perpetually charges the capacitor
(note here: if the PVDF film were etched as was
previously mentioned with further patterning, this
could massively increase voltage potentially, via
increasingly its capacitance or storage capacity
for holding energy, seemingly of higher voltage)
though what really got my mind spinning was
the idea of another format for this piezo polymer
and that is 'piezo coaxial cable'. [7] [8]
in that, this idea of PVDF as an antenna then is
tending towards a shape or form that has been
used for antennas, that is: a length of wire that
picks up signals as wavelengths geometrically
align with, map onto, influence its properties.
(that is, if not mistaken in how things work)
and so my mind starts thinking of making a
loop out of this cable, as if a transponder that
is used to track some emitting signal, or as a
certain type of TV console antenna even, if not
rabbit ears in retrospect. and what is the actual
difference in these different materials functioning,
plain metal and piezo polymer, in terms of antenna
the obvious is that the latter generates power if it
begins to vibrate. and holds onto it as a capacitor,
so it builds up and stores the external influence.
though more, consider the issue of high-voltage,
that a long length of wire could potentially hold a
lot of charge. and this in a context of sensing...
there is the classic example of 'wireless power'
in a person holding fluorescent tube lights under
the powerlines of a high-voltage pylon corridor
that in turn illuminates the lights via EMFs by
way of the surrounding intense levels of radiation
that bathe the area in proximity to such towers
so there is massive energy in the air, ionizing it,
around high voltage electric transmission towers,
enough to light a fluorescent (AC) lightbulb that
otherwise requires a ballast/transformer to do so
(again, if not mistaken), in that charge/electrons
are rapidly moving back and forth through a gas
held inside the unlit tube that then generates light
by triggering a reaction that releases or produces
photons via the current shooting through the gas
(sidenote: LEDs interesting in similar way, light
or photons produced by jumping gap in a circuit)
note: DANGER: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DO THIS
WITHOUT PROPER EXPERTISE/QUALIFICATIONS...
now imagine you have a loop of piezo coaxial cable
that can function as an antenna. potentially and-or
seemingly, it would be able to 'read' the temperature
difference via the radiation in the area underneath or
nearby similar high-voltage towers. though this may
co-exist as a variable with frequency/vibration thus
heat may just be another way of saying the same
thing, though in a more tangible or perceivable way,
in that its influence may be more apparent.
here is why it is not advisable for a do-it-yourselfer-
because any length of this piezo cable is a capacitor
that can store energy, and the larger the cable the
more voltage that could be stored, it would appear,
and thus if such an antenna were use and capable
of storing large amounts of high voltage charge, it
then could be deadly dangerous to be holding onto
this cable because it would be inducing current from
the powerlines and potentially into the body, in terms
of its grounding (say, straight through an arm to heart
then out one foot or both) potentially like getting hit
by lightning. any precautions that would be taken
by electrical workers that work on high voltage lines
would be relevant as security precautions for any
such experimentation. and yet, if a circuit were
made around such an antenna -- potentially via
paired or matching VIBRATION alone, this same
piezo cable device could potentially provide much
more power and current via its energy harvesting.
(or so it is speculated here)
in a more removed situation, or a smaller antenna,
it could potentially be used to map EMFs via piezo
wire in the way Hall effect sensors are used today,
though again with the benefit of energy harvesting
and providing power to circuitry. thus piezo cable,
as antenna, could have its own unique attributes
and properties that could better align in certain
situations or circumstances to provide power or
function as an antenna, whereby the 'microphone'
or listening is occurring in a vibrational realm that
is not connected to material vibration beyond its
own support structure, instead, as antenna it is
tuning into strong fields (as heat, here proposed)
that would potentially be capable of providing this
source of vibrational needed to power circuitry,
yet further, also a signal of meaning about the
nature of the environment in its electromagnetic
composition and ordering, mapping or direction
based on these attributes, features of landscape
that is relevant in terms of health and energy
so then i was done with thinking about it and
then encountered a photograph that inspired
another layer of thinking within this domain...
it was of a woman's hat [9] created by a fashion
designer that spoke to these issues in terms of
its language and aesthetics, providing insight into
the nature of the questions involved.
what if, for instance, the piezo film tab sensors
were able to monitor the heat or radiation as this
correlates to vibrational frequencies of cellphones
as they are held against the skull, and evaluate
the radiation involved at the blood-brain barrier as
this influences tumor development in humans via
sending this transmission of cellphone signals
from the phone to the cellular towers? in other
words, what if this little sensor could be placed
on a hat, alongside the surface of the skin, and
register and monitor the radiation levels from
omnidirectional antennas shooting EMFs and
coded patterns into the human brain, as part of
this relation between people, tools, technology
and infrastructure - "daily ~communionication"
again, the wonders of the piezo film indicate that
they do respond to monitoring of skin, and thus
likely a viable approach to modeling this relation,
and testing against "official evidence" about how
these antennas and vibrations are influencing the
human physiology. real-time cellphone monitoring
(another approach could involve a PVDF sensor at
the only opening of an otherwise EMF-opaque box
or container that has a cellphone in it, attempting to
transmit or radiate its signal, and measuring activity
via vibration or heat from this at various distances)
additional hats provided further insight into aspects
of multiple tunings [10] via adjusting cantilevers or
tuning forks, to what frequencies are related to and
through, as part of consciousness as information,
this in a non-electromagnetic framework seemingly.
and also of the nature of the mind being targeted by
hostile signaling [11] in these toxic domains of the
technical wilderness, functioning against humanity.
in that disease and illness correlate with these same
issues as they remain ignored and unaddressed, and
allowing continuing abuse of power based on hidden
leverage that results from no checks and balances
upon unrestrained technological development for
private goals and agendas, against public interest
the kicker is that such technology could already be
deployed in a hidden framework or context, just as
it is hard to imagine ubiquitous mass surveillance via
technological infrastructure without this corresponding
in some significant way to a paid informant network on
the ground, in close proximity, allowing full spectrum
monitoring that tends towards gossip as power that
is exploited in the political bias within infrastructure,
emperor no clothes policy laid bare via own tattle tales
thus, what if likewise, the potential for such sensing as
harvesting of free energy already exists yet remains in
a realm of secrecy, leveraged against populations on
the outside of this inner society. what if different truths
exist that remain unaccounted for, different economics
that then become the basis for exploitation via illusion,
via not sharing the discoveries and using this for power,
to take over domains via ruse, deception, ill-intent, etc
in other words: the conspiracy revealed, now out in the open...
take for instance the unusual aesthetics of a local substation
for electric power 'delivery', like a router, bus, or hub that then
transforms the voltage en route to its destination. under the
ordinary or standard model of power distribution, this could
be assumed to function in one way and one way only...
powerplant ==> transmission towers ==> substation ==> distribution poles
that is, the power is generated at a power station, moved
through high-voltage cables suspended from towers to a
substation, where this power is stepped down and then
further distributed via wooden poles to various dwellings
though 'the antennas' could be for lightning protection, it
seems highly unusual to have a large array of them or at
least this design approach has not yet been encountered
before this, and calls into question what is new about it.
i had previously speculated it was a free energy substation
tapping into atmospheric electricity via the antennas, though
until the PVDF sensors did not understand how this might be
possible. in fact, thinking about it right now, combining piezo
antennas with HAARP atmospheric injections of frequency is
potentially the model for remote power delivery at national or
international scale, ala Nikola Telsa's Wardenclyffe Tower [13]
in this scenario, the substation would be the 'generator' in that
it could tune into a given vibration (perhaps Schumann resonance)
and create high voltage electricity on-site, via remote transfer of
energy -as information- seemingly, outside an electromagnetic
context yet tied back into it via properties of nature, its order.
in this way, power delivery could begin at the substation locally,
then distribute back outwards to both high-voltage lines and the
reduced-voltage distribution poles, from the substation itself, a
decentralized power generation and delivery system, in effect,
locally, though harmonized at a larger scale via atmospheric
electricity as the generator or transmitter of 'motive power',
if not conceptualizing this in error. that would be the illusion,
that the powerplant is sending the power and not substation
 substation ==> transmission/distribution ==> local power
thus like a crystal oscillator functioning in reverse as piezo sensor,
if 'free energy' were being harvested at the substation-level, then a
different organization of these relations exists than what is said to
exist and used as a basis for top-down power structures in society.
a decentralized, distributed, non-toxic energy that is limitless versus
an infrastructure based on oil and gasoline and goal and nuclear energy
that is destructive, basically raping the earth and likewise its inhabitants
to fuel a given insane development strategy functioning against humanity
as this aligns with 'green politics' and 'environmentalism', its politics and
moral agenda within what is a warped accounting for various such factors.
in other words, perhaps battery power is only an issue for those on
the outside of this. if it indeed were to exist as a parallel infrastructure
in the everyday environment. and maybe that is being used as leverage,
a secret hidden development with different economics, social dynamics,
and political goals that are not 'represented' in existing language, instead
functioning outside or beyond its limiting frameworks and outdated views
and beliefs, which provide cover and camouflage for sustaining trickery,
exploiting it, and securing its place in relation to the rogue world state,
thoroughly invested in its mission to serve its hidden special interests,
having divested humanity long ago for private rewards in doing so.
wouldn't it be nice to see a circuit diagram of how those antennas
are hooked up at the substation. really interesting if it involved more
than 'ground' and instead was part of a piezo-based energy harvesting
engine capable of generating constant high-voltage power, for instance.
and who would the power to such oversight to occur within society?
seemingly nobody. that is the entirety of the situation right there-
*game over*

i did not connect the two themes together until now,
 though consider again the residential high rise building
 with an antenna array on top, previously sent to the list,
 in the context that it could be harvesting its own power
 and disconnected from the surrounding energy grid via
 the antenna array at its crown. off the books energy, at
 the same time brutal wars fought to sustain oil power...
 (how is that for ethics and morality of secret leadership,
 and issues of corruption, deception, hidden evil agenda)
 in other words: the antennas are for capturing energy and
 not just for communications signals, a la piezo technology
 again, how to audit the circuitry involved. who has authority
 to evaluate such systems in their technological functioning.

i think this is actually the model for human beings as conceived
in long ago times, though may be mistaken. in the Middle Ages
or thereafter, the nervous system itself was medically illustrated
as a plant, held within the watery container of the liquid body, in
this way, in the abstract, not unlike a jellyfish with mobile ocean
again, if memory serves, perhaps it was Plato who described
also the nature of thought in terms of the brain, its enlightenment,
whereby the roots of the nervous system flower into an open mind
which receives light and nourishment from truth, tracking it this way
as flowers situate themselves according to environment, nutrients
so the idea of 'plants' and ~enlightenment, 'knowing' as this relates
to truth and essentially grounding informational and physical realms,
perhaps some kind of natural alignment taking place, harmonization
that is organic, an aspect of ecological foundation and its circuitry,
potentially then scaled to the cosmos, especially with regard to the
theories of origins via panspermia [1], ye olde mushroom astronauts,
delivering life onto earth via asteroid or comets, seeding the oceans;
in this way, sentience of octopus, dolphins, their social intelligence
and awareness, consciousness, alike with jellyfish, as if homologue
with pre-embedded state of nervous system for humans, in vitro (?)
prior to final packaging of mammalian biped and adjustable thumbs
the idea that all life moves towards higher consciousness and that
intelligence and this yearning motivation for greater truth is life, its
force, the trajectory of the grand design from nano- to macro-scale,
issues of culture, freedom, war, occurring at all scales, to survive,
conquer, for what means and ends, what principles, or darkness if
bounded by the false, those who serve it, obey it as if the master.
here cybernetic feedback likewise at all interconnected levels else
its incapacitation, making the living captive to those ceasing to live,
to grow, to evolve beyond existing constraints, limited beliefs, ideas.
the fix of ideology the danger, wrong assumptions and modeling or
subversion of view and awareness to contain, trap, mislead, control
so the idea of information related to intelligence connected with this
condition of LIFE, perhaps related also to plants and awareness, of
a natural condition of sentience even, perhaps, as biome, as with
the Gaia hypothesis of earth as supraorganism, living entity unto
itself as a larger totality or 'living ecosystem', [2] Earth as being.
i think also the book A Guide for the Perplexed delved into this
area in terms of a progression of life, from mineral to vegetable to
animal to human. [3] if not mistaken, from evaluating the wikipedia
page, the issue of nesting exists in that each higher form of life has
within it those underneath it; thus the human is inextricably related
to the mineral, vegetative, animalistic, of which they are composed,
as this also effects consciousness, awareness, and intelligence [4]
a personal experience about this issue of 'living ecosystems' that
themselves may have a larger awareness or consciousness than
just the part -- say, a forest as a supraorganism that is sentient...
(developed a close connection and friendship with a wild deer and
learned how to communicate with her. then observed behavior in
various settings, role of muteness, listening, scent, wind, shiny
objects, distance, motion, fear, nutrition, locomotion, etc. and
when relocating the deer into a more wilderness environment,
it became apparent how she was one-with-the-environment in
a way that an urban park did not allow, as if in wrong circuitry;
deer can basically disappear within a few feet in a forest, and
be totally silent at the same time as observing you searching
for them or just moving past, through their domain. then in the
effort to communicate, connection with camouflage and trees
and leaves helped realize how antlers are very much like sticks,
and how 'eyes' on trees, openings in the bark, are like those of
deer and other animals watching or monitoring the area, each
connected to the others, as part of a larger connected system.
as if all eyes of the forest even. part of a larger awareness and
knowing this, having this as consciousness, shared circuitry.
in other words the deer is the forest, the forest is the deer,
the tree is the deer, the deer is the tree, a hidden symbiotic
relation or structural connectivity that goes beyond one entity
or one life, and spans across them as a larger, longer relation
as if functioning together, moving in a shared direction, thus
life dependent on other life, in terms of its dynamic circuitry,
then stresses, pressures, motivations occurring against this)
should have also mentioned issues of governance related to
consciousness and intelligence, knowledge and awareness
as they rely on shared structures and foundations (circuitry)
that allow self-sustaining or connected systems to develop
within certain parameters, and thus origin stories of rocks
and minerals connected with cosmological big bang and
development of universe, galaxies, solar system, planets;
this then physics and chemistry, molecules moving into a
realm of organisms, life, and of vegetation and plants, thus
biology, botany, chemistry, horticulture, (if not aspects of
archaeology, paleontology in terms of research & studies),
then into fauna, animals, realm of biology and zoology if
not anthropology, to move into sociology, anthropology,
economics, politics, culture, 'arts', architecture, crypto.
(note here- question of crypto at mineral and vegetable,
not just present-day context of p2p computer exchange)
also note the role of behaviorist science to treat humans
only as animals, lowering their intellectual status via a
limited model of existence to Darwinian framework that
squares humans with apes, not divine entities or origin,
as this relates to loss of empirical truth, logic, reasoning
within society then enforced by universities, psychiatry
in particular, where 'medicine' helps this devolutionary
process occur, in the black arts of political diagnoses
that reverse the alchemical process: lead to gold via
toxic pills that destroy circuitry and the ability to think,
all to uphold a worldview of humans as merely animals,
managed as livestock, routed to holocaust cattle chutes
here, the ideology buttressed by anthropological skulldiggery
and archaeological equivalence, the sociological likewise as
if all are the same, no matter if ascending or descending in
relation to having once previously ascended or descended,
such that apes becoming more human-like, humans more
apelike, humans more humans, apes more and more ape;
and hell, why not reference Planet of the Apes once again
as a context for Lincoln related civil war of said ideology
so behaviorism backed up by 'political sciences' as cult,
as this translates into a dumbing-down and enforcement
of status quo dynamics, moving from human to the animal,
vegetable, & mineral, the more robotic, base the interactions
and so consciousness, awareness, intelligence, communication
becoming less and less overt time, bounded by psychiatric limits
of what that is perceptible is acceptable in given frameworks, the
'brain police' monitoring everyone as potentially out of control apes,
this slavery, contained within a ideology that has become the state,
requires certain beliefs and conformance to illusory representations
and obey is the only option- or else, there goes your mind & body
biome again, people living in toxic realm, despoiled environment
then forcibly adapted to it if not by peer pressure as selection,
the most unfit and mediocre the champions and successors in
wasteland, just follow brain-dead rules of the machine to survive;
(if that does not work, take these pills and start behaving or else;
children as young as 2 y.o. being dosed by psychiatrists to rewire
troubled beings in such a hellhole, killing off any chance of survival
before turning completely bonkers when cerebrum lights all at once,
essentially programming population of mind-controlled psychopaths;
forgot implant antenna, deranged psych pills enough to circuit design)
so peoples in mental institutions often referred to as vegetables,
as with those brain dead in hospitals, else comatose, operating or
existing in a realm beyond. catatonia, etc. as this tends also to a
realm of mootness, or otherness, perhaps related to the autistic,
of a bounded or limited realm where communication is not occurring
yet should be or once did, those somehow is miswired or rewired
and thus the circuits are not connected or integrated to enable
the internal/external relation, as if person trapped inside the self
and how this relates to communication and balancing, processing
of stimuli, how to make sense of what is going on, especially if
living in a frenetic world that does not make sense to begin with
the correlation to this general condition (it as nausea, malaise)
is a Spore-like entity that can function as essentially brainless,
mindless, and make-do and make-their-way in the labyrinth as
if dungeon master granted special powers and abilities. this is
The Beast known as feelings-only, who matches phase change
and state to what is liked and not liked, what makes happy or
sad or mad, mediating existence on these immediate terms
without capacity, depth, or willingness to consider beyond this
quasi-emotional framework, detached from larger grounding in
surrounding truth, such that judgement can be immediate as
to sensory perception, yet also disconnected from the larger
reality, and instead function as delusion state of being and
mistaken awareness. these people become MANAGERS
(a joke here), many times. and compliance to rules, other
beliefs in a too-simple and stupidistic mindset/framework
then orchestrates and elevates the dumb to supremacy as
'true believers' in the warped model, because of its benefits
to them and their kind, without further question or insight;
just following, enforcing, repeating, extending mediocrity
when these types become teachers, in autocratic status-
based hierarchy, 'truth' is legislated by likable beliefs and
those unliked, disfavored, easily censored based on moral
belief in superiority of this lesser and base existence and
way of being and 'thinking' as if a more limited animal, in
that the human becomes a trained ape by such relation,
as it becomes education, career, 'voting', and otherwise
so, choosing to be vegetable, choosing that path, and
communicating or scenting and signaling in that realm,
procreation, spawning more of such kind automatically,
housing, feeding, schooling, refining a given production
to enable such a mindless population to manage us,
the lower then determining actions of those higher in
a realm of functioning, awareness, ideas, capacities;
and because politically correct, illegal to say anything
against this for fear of upsetting those benefiting from it
another aspect is drug culture in the supposedly non-legal
domain though also hypocritically mainstream, thus law
does not apply if favored, yet is used to imprison others
unprotected. professional drug users staying out of prison,
others with any infraction that threaten the state: goodbye
then moralizing about anything from this perspective as if
universal quite problematic, if only for the massive bullshit
factor it involves on a corrupt societal scale, prophets of
counterculture too many to list, though enough shithead
musicians represent into the present day, so it becomes
unnecessary- just turn on media and see the idiots posing
as if enlightened, encultured to wasteland as peak, ideal
instead of base, bottom-feeding, making profit from shit
within this context of counterculture, drug zeitgeist the
counter pendulum to rise of psychiatric and its duplicity,
the structural connection and association with 'new age'
of consciousness, awareness, philosophical beliefs and
questioning of principles, religious, spiritual, every other
so quaaludes and acid trippers reach top of mountain as
Moses' and then fall all the way back down again, repeat
this thousands and millions of times, the more piling on,
and this too a search for enlightenment for many, if not
of destroying the self in order to find the self once again,
the displacement then involving recentering, and a way
into questioning and other way and types of knowing
the problem is that it is removed of its depth, grounding
as ritual and of potential spiritual practice and instead
can function in a realm of the base and profane, and
thus tends towards devolutionary processes rather
than the opposite, indicating growth beyond existing
boundaries, not just in a single realm, though overall,
in the total circuit. for example, you could be in bliss
temporarily yet residing in a shithole for the rest of life
and it may not balance out or move beyond this or
even be able to be sustained, the destructive cycle
where drugs can short-circuit via near-term fixes
for longer-term problems, larger situations beyond
the self, yet drugs can entrap people in their own
smaller worldviews, create boundaries not open up
connections, and rely on synchronizing with sickness
and toxic conditions and become further a part of
its structure, the downward force and momentum,
yet not accounted for this way, taken out of context
that is the bullshit about too-easy enlightenment,
that it is in the pill and not in the self to begin with,
and about access and unlocking and not substituting
a life for a parallel condition existing outside or beyond
it, no longer responsible or responsive to surroundings,
then becoming this ecosystem, eyes and ears of the
drug even, which is the larger point of the vegetative
people becoming cocaine, becoming heroine, they
as if plants, the awareness of 'like=like' then mapping
into consciousness with others and hidden subculture,
knowing who is within a similar domain or functioning
based on subtle clues and intelligence and signaling
who has gone far into the void, who knows what you
know or has seen what you have seen. what kinds of
knowledge, misery, motivations, betrayals, violence,
deceptions. what kind of treachery hangs in the air
as a potential, what parameters or dimensions exist
in superposition that given nearby circuitry could alight
this can be a realm of seers and sages and prophecy,
of intelligence if grounded, connected to ideas, yet it
can as easily lead into babble and vacancy of truth
beyond the illusion, lead astray into further falsity,
and thus how a person is grounded then influences
how drugs effect and their mediation, what results
this could be a healthy controlled practice that is
medicinal and rite-of-passage, or it could lead towards
loss of greater truth or purposes, and people instead
devolving to the drug, becoming trapped, encrypted
in its domain, surrogate yet also societal parasite
doing bidding of forces subhuman, antihuman even
as organisms seek to control and define territory as
ecosystem, the orchid keeping insects alive for its
own good, drugs governing others nervous systems
the plague of their effectiveness is not only in body,
it is also in the brain and mind, where drugs can limit
sensory considerations into a narrow range and thus
'intelligence' can become confined to a smaller world
and view as ecosystem that relies on false constraints
required for the ecosystem to function as it already does
thus institutionalizing what can be inequalities or biases
or injustices to sustain what is a false-consciousness
at the universal level it may be perceived or believed,
in some sense artificial or unnatural, unreal, a fiction
yet inside this circuitry, it may be 'the most real reality'
consider the human entity as circuit, the nervous system
having a spinal column mapping nerves, sensory feedback
of body into brainstem and 'mind', the capital of the column
consider this is a platform for development, and how any
nutrients or vegetation or carnivore activity then influences
this system in its functioning, the parameters it exists and
sustains itself within, in terms of its governance as scaled
to a larger shared relation with others, in structural terms
(ie the state). thus, any atoms and molecules that go into
this feedback-based system have certain functioning that
result in how it all relates, the dynamics of interaction and
exchange, where truth resides and how it is processed,
not totally unlike a pinball game in its tallying of points
so, if eating some minerals, say having water from a
spring, there could be iron in the water that effects how
a person functions, like vitamins, which then programs
certain cells or influences function, say in regard to blood
somehow or various organs that process these nutrients
or manage those parameters as part of total metabolism
water and humans create a circuit. water is a circuit and
humans are a circuit and together they combine. and it
goes into ecosystems, clouds, environment, ground,
such that if the land is toxic the water is likely effected
and thereby the person, even if in trace amounts, as part
of how the larger ecosystem is balanced, finds alignment
and adjusts or adapts or deteriorates in given dynamics,
perhaps a person becomes ill from lead in the water, etc
likewise, leafy greens in a salad as circuitry, food, and
meat, say from a cow, as this relates to how ingredients
used for daily diets effect and are effected by a larger
circuit, of self though also of groups of people, the state
they together compose, and the environment itself as a
part of this relationship, dynamic, in existing dimensions;
how these are or are not accounted for, then, precluding
what is tallied or 'acknowledged' and in what ways, else
denied, say chemicals on plants that promote cancer
via homeopathic approach, poisoning via 1,000 disease
vectors to eventually hit the genocide jackpot over time;
so too, raising cattle in debilitating conditions, injecting
with hormones to negatively effect humans down range,
eating spiked levels of animal stress and pain as circuit,
perhaps losing nutrition though gaining the amplification
of similar disease promotion via chemical absorption
into cells, their malfunctioning, all part of the plan
this as circuitry, toxic ecosystem functioning against
LIFE, devolving humans to livestock yet vegetable and
eventually robots via very same ideology of technique
removed of higher truth than what is politically allowed,
thus allowing social, behavorial, mental-engineering to
head towards this as if nirvana, 'enlightened following'
where greatest capacity is equated with end of cycle
of existence, by way of extinction of human 'species';
and it is legislated no less. how stupid do people have
to be to go along with it, especially unthinkingly, without
resistance or taking it on as a situation... why is there
an absence of intelligence in dealing with the basics
here, why the gap? perhaps everyone is stoned and
playing games on their fucking iphones, using PGP
to complain about how crooked things are, IDFK
and yet enlightened, opinionated, at same time helpless,
pathetic, yet self-righteous as if superior awareness or
knowing while incapacitated and unwilling to take the
leap into the maw of death enough to trust greater truth,
that the purpose is much larger than any person and that
an infrastructure exist, nature itself, to remedy this situation
beyond all the lies, and yet there is lack of faith or belief--
in truth. in logic. in reality beyond a limited warped view
reliant on relativism, the lies and betrayals of education
becoming commonplace as viewpoint, turned against self,
people cannot even trust their own minds, so thoroughly
mistaken and beholden to external validation of what is
so basically, the individual is fucked. the shared set of
people absolutely absent from engaging the situation in
the terms it exists, beyond the self and small groups
that still can rely upon and benefit from the bullshit factor
and various other limits, impeding larger ecosystem truth,
being that is beyond existing boundaries or misconceptions
then it is a time of count of be counted, who is awake
and who is aware and who serves truth and is willing to
make sacrifices and who are those doing it already and
how is this all connected in a larger structural framework,
as it relates individual awareness in varying dimensions with
others, molecular processing of interconnected consciousness
and where does mind meet its embodiment, deeds, not only
words, and at what scale or what limitation, what amount of
self-serving bullshit and privilege versus sacrifice, losing the
egostic framework that requires its own safety to persist,
disconnection from suffering as if above, instead corrupted
and serving self firstly and projecting this outward to others;
unaccounted for, how much betrayed by the psycho-logical,
a great many tells exist for parameters that remain para-
and thus insight can tend towards involution, yet warped
and ungrounded, as if superior knowing when actually less
thus is the nature of the egotist who believes because of
station to know everything, even though wrongly, while
mocking another who thinks they know something, as if
that is the arrogance and an impossible, due to superiority
on these themes then, there are people who journey into
a realm of drugs and document their research, such as
ethnobotanist Terrance McKenna, [5] and this tends also
towards Thompson-Leary cryptography, [6] in that it is not
only the signaling of plants themselves though their effects
within people and culture, which extends this signaling at
human scale and in human dynamics and ecosystems,
that could be sacred or profane, given implementation
though perhaps also more than this: toxic and poison
exists and being able to absorb it can deteriorate not
enhance in the ways believed as if all is transcendent,
or like climbing mountains, leads to heights not depths;
(if living in an inverted world, things may be backwards)
(note here: as with crystals and piezo-sensors as organic
or natural circuitry, the chemical compounds and circuitry
of drugs, both those defined legal and illegal [7][8], as it
relates to how that circuitry, visualized, may correlate with
certain dimensions and parameters of its effects, in that
the different visual structure maps to different systems in
the body and mind, different ecosystems or dynamics.
thus, like a custom programmed IC or microcontroller,
so too Aspirin or Ambien or Acid or patterns delivered.
in other words: where's the message, what is the key,
where is the information, what is encrypted, how is this
circuitry, how does it map, metabolize, transform and
change, positive and negative dynamics, feedback...
and not to forget, all of this as language, its calculus)
principles and intelligence related to horticulture, then,
Luther Burbank's work The Training of the Human Plant
[9] as this could relate to culture, cultivation, the cultic
imagination and manifestation, of ideas and of ideology
if raising the vegetable as higher consciousness and
becoming one with nature, it could also involve loss of
certain critical facilities or awareness in turn, and this
could be a danger for a way of being that no longer is
human, or no longer serves a higher truth than what is
accessed immediately and in proximity to the body
in terms of its likes and agreements and hospitalities,
and a movement away from truth or regression could
occur, and thinking could be turned against itself so
that the lower is again the higher, people in service
to something that is less intelligent, though in this
way, combining with the circuit, ecosystem, fusing
and then becoming vegetable, animal. in terms of
rites-of-passage, this may be inherent, as with an
embryological view of reptile, mammalian sections
of brain as it develops, old brain and new, and yet,
to then situate a self in a limiting framework and
obey its constraints could also be to decouple
from the natural world for an illusion replacing it,
a false consciousness believed as if higher truth
here be witchcraft and paganism and other forms,
cannibalism and other practices likewise that can
operate in such physics though also in exploitation
not recognize or serve other truths, this danger of
losing the human, turning to falsity as power. and
thus 'humans as plants' turns to 'plants as human'
and another framework of ethics, morality, judgement
and ways of being potentially aligned in other terms
thus people occupy these realms, some witchcraft
dark and serving against truth, while others good
and using knowledge of nature and its metaphysics
for life, healing, medicine, the paradoxical condition,
the Caduceus [10] and Rod of Asclepius [11], their
dual-role of sickness and health, the importance of
being able to recognize its value and not outlaw it,
the truth involved, yet to do so accurately, clearly,
accounting for actual conditions and not ideological,
which then infects minds, corrupts intelligence, etc
(a double-dealing War of Drugs that is a hypocritical
onesided takedown of political enemies forbids this
yet exploits the condition to retain silence, or else
the NSA will ruin your life and quicken extinction.
this is how evil gets a foothold in society, becoming
governance, people obeying and serving this falsity)
so, what say you to worshiping mandrake root? [12]
"i'm up for it, do you have coke to go along with it?"
perhaps tending to profane here... people becoming this
drug, its deliverance as plague even, as consciousness
that is skewed and distorted and worms its way further
into culture via principles aligned with toxic dynamics,
becoming ecosystem, way of being turns to nothingness.
the void, a mirror-image of knowing that is actually false,
ungrounded in its symmetrical belief, incorrectly aligned
with events yet not accounting for structural aberrations
and therefore ignorance a basis of such supreme belief,
as if above it all, operating in a realm of higher awareness
when instead a conceit that does not correlate with reality
and eventually, to be accounted for in cosmic ecosystem
what this is to suggest is that, people becoming plants
is a devolutionary process, a regression of intellectual
capacity that returns to feeling-based diagnostics that
can be localized out of other dimensional frameworks
that were once connected, coherent, and correlated
as lies and falsity are normalized, toxic poison of mind
that is shared amongst many can, like invasive species
overtake localities, growing and thriving in place of the
natural habitat, with devastating consequence for the
prospects of life on terms against the ecosystem, or
ecosystem engineered to be against sustaining of life,
these destructive principles of death and hate, turning
people into lower lifeforms, humans as subhumans, as
if only apes or less than this even, judged, sentenced
to death via this insane and evil ideology, this artifice,
unaligned, disconnected, hostile to nature, life, love
then it should be mentioned- turning this into religion...
use of what seems to be a multimeter to diagnose the
human in its electromagnetic circuitry, as lying plant,
though to question Scientology methodology, if this
fever graph is mapping of galvonic skin response or
perhaps 'information' in its vibrational context, as the
circuits would be different, and perhaps another layer
or boundary of interpretation exists between these, in
that non-acoustic acoustic phenomena could be judged
as acoustic, or non-acoustic as electromagnetic yet the
circuits evaluated could be too simple for what is involved
and thus the problem of thinking, of logic and reasoning
in relativistic frameworks that could tend towards rule
of behaviorism _over mind, over higher awareness and
in this way- the rule of language over people, so that
ideas must conform to a given rationalization, ideology
that can be wrong-headed or wrong-minded or of wrong
or inaccurate beliefs yet unchecked as ecosystem and
in this way, mislead or rely on certain 'limited knowing'
versus actual understanding or comprehension beyond
a given faulty framework, where short-circuiting could
be the key to health and not just sickness, correcting
every anomaly leading to forced silencing, versus the
role of sensors, the diagnostic evaluation, clues that
map out circuitry yet not necessarily in their entirety,
the mystery much larger than any parts combined,
when disconnected from ecosystem as if controlled;
the false consciousness default if methodologically
forcing such truth, grounding to the false all too easy,
perhaps the main sickness of institutions over time,
corruption from reliance on ideas divorced from truth
beyond narrowed limits, losing self-awareness while
representing it as if pillar or structure, foundation for
others, symbolic, yet still potentially ungrounded,
the problem of being blinded from believing to know
and yet in this belief, forbidding such awareness
in other words, once again, attaining grounding in
an unnatural or toxic habitat, as this potentially can
relate to lies or falsity, and then 'enlightenment' by
the normalization of this ecosystem relation that
can function in negative, hostile, immoral relations
and dynamics for food, survival, shelter, knowledge,
then going on to represent and replace culture that
was to serve life and now is about serving death and
a certain range of parameters, dimensions, dynamics
that are 'healthy' and 'good' for this diseased condition
and its state of being that is centered on nothingness,
no higher goals than the base and material exploitation
crypto in this context, signaling, as patterns and signs,
symbols and their processing, relations based on these,
correlation between circuitries, issues of competing biomes
and ecosystems, different if hidden ecosystems, ecologies,
different mechanisms and dynamics, as this maps onto
forms, artifacts, events, to be read/written as language,
the correlation of dimensions, shared or unshared, like
or unlike, those who are vegetable-like feeling-based if
not connected with the false world and the oppression,
versus those thinking beyond, into/from other principles-
all of it as circuitry, consciousness, signaling, codes,
crypto, messaging and communications, protocols,
layers, habitat, food, poison/medicine, culture, flow
what is the greater consciousness of the false order?
perhaps the shared lie as it maps to realms of artifice
what is the greater consciousness of truth?
perhaps shared being in the world, truth, live, love
in this way, two entities and existences, information
and its circuits grounding either to truth or to falsity
(the paradox: never beyond a realm of good and evil)

@_subject: blackflag operations 
at a certain point in my independent research it was
realized that the US flag itself represented the existing
problem encountered with ideology and rule-following
that automatically functions against core principles,
such that 'the stars' were of false constellations and
'the stripes' were more those of prison bars, to hold
the population captive inside a hierarchical top-down
structure, which i equate with a conceptualization in
Networks of Power, of system, order, and control [1]
as it determines economic, social, political dynamics.
thus the US flag, its symbolism, is part of the problem
in terms of its rigid adherence, especially in a realm of
patriotism and xenophobia, such that it appears to deign
reasonable the US as world empire without questioning
its own failures or correcting for them, only extending it
further outward, which then serves policies the hidden
US dictatorship perfectly, as long as silence is upheld
and no communication is possible about these issues.
(that is, in terms of reasoning of empirical truth as this
would be observed by the law as the basis for power,
versus making the constitution a relativistic document
interpreted via power determining what the signs mean)
in this way, so too the powerplant and grid of development
that underlines present-day civilization, a centralized and
hidden realm of top-down power and control governed by
private interests said to function on behalf of the public,
yet with little evidence of this within ruins of the planet.
in other words: power delivery is related to governance.
and how power flows in one-direction and 'represents'
certain goals and ideals that do not map into the local
issues or shared values beyond a certain framework or
mindset that makes monetary profit is greatest truth.
and yet truth does not work this way. which is to say,
it is not invalidated by ignoring or censoring it out of
existence within these domains, it still exists though
is isolated, disconnected, and thus loses its power
via a false-worldview that takes its place via lies and
deception, a shared illusion that is ungrounded yet
sustained in a bubble, antihuman in word and deed.
in terms of consciousness, much of this is known
and experienced day to day, life to life, yet remains
uncommunicable due to the loss of language, the
absence of connection in realistic terms, about this
inhuman condition, the center of civilization becoming
that of nothingness, of lost souls at the core of it, this
essential vacancy of meaning, devaluing of knowledge
beyond what interests and benefits those in authority,
and thus a seemingly irrational situation exists and is
mediated, one by one, that does not add up nor does
it make any sense, part to whole, because all is left
is fragmented and misaligned, dumbed down, warped
and skewed such that a hall of fun-house mirrors is
the limit to daily reflection in status quo relations, as
nothing more can be said than some finite limit where
the basic situation cannot even be acknowledged, so
hostile is the background and near-field effects, that
any error or wrong thought could jeopardize survival
and force a person into exile or worse, via all-seeing
accountants for conformity, verifying and making sure
the brain washing is effective, all remain followers of
the ideological framework, staying within its confines
and so knowing is disconnected for saying or even
thinking, people detached from themselves and others
and then to awake and find oneself situated in this way;
essentially without being, without access to their own
true nature or capacity or abilities, instead neutered
by what is now convention, via subversion, deception
electromagnetism as the context for the US flag then
recontextualizes some questions of vexillology [2], in
that evaluating the symbolic structure of the flag in its
relation to electrical infrastructure as a system of power
that extends beyond electricity into issues of politics of
the state, including waging of war for natural resources,
and likewise systems based on this ordering, visualized
in urban and rural artifacts of transmission pylons and
distribution poles, then provides further context for the
issues of control - including 'surveillance' in this same
top-down structure, which serves the hierarchy firstly,
to retain its existing historical organization, however
hollowed out and corrupted, used as a false-flag op
in thinking through issues of endless war in the
Middle East and the nonsensical War of Error as it
relates to failure of ideas to govern state actions and
instead submission to faith in leadership and hidden
policies and political agendas, antihuman in ideology
and nature, due to their inaccuracy, loss of capacity
in thinking and language that then functions against
citizens and life, instead of on behalf of these -- this
situation then becoming 'source code' and program
based on flawed and wrong-minded processing of
actions, using, relying upon, exploiting loopholes
in the US constitution as basis for what is possible,
this becoming morality and ethics and its own truth,
the danger of action being untethered from grounded
reasoning and instead FAITH-BASED in ideology of
rightness, with no remaining checks and balances
after the orchestrated power grab, post-coup (41)
in which the state is opposed to truth that does not
serve and submit to this hidden agenda as highest
what have you then, as a citizen in this situation,
do you benefit or are your days numbered as you
wait, channeled into the correct chutes for awaiting
cattle cars, death panels and Obamacare first steps
enough is enough, sanity must regain its place, and
reason based in grounded truth must be secured for
anything other than this automatic decline to continue
into a realm of pure hate and unrestrained evil, driven
by the state in its godless construction and operation
in this way, US Blackflag operations were called for
to regain control over the state and its actions via
an emergency measure built into the constitution that
allows a constitutional convention to be called if or when
the state goes off course due to legal guidelines once written
yet which function against the very principles they stand for
and thus, to raise the Blackflag as the symbol and sign of
this human citizen, to reclaim control over the shared state
and its governance, and remove the existing US flag from its
role as oppressor of its own and other populations, in that
the truth of the US Constitution has become decoupled from
its accounting in logic, beyond that of shared opinion within
language (sign=sign based pattern matching), such that the
views 'believed' are ideological, based and reliant upon ever
shifting relativism that maps to motives of power & authority
over this process of interpretation, as institutionalized, this
the very structure of society, politics, economics, yet within
a bubble view that cannot be falsified, contested, debated
even (see: closed, onesided mass media), and this as the
authority, the 'mind' at the top of the machinery, that sees
and observes everything in this warped, unreal self-serving
viewpoint, that what is good for it is the best for everybody,
any number of rationalizations reinforcing this viewpoint,
and yet no error correction anywhere allowed, especially
in a legal context, because truth itself has been outlawed
thus the ability to critique or correct the malfunctioning of
the state is an impossibility, given the loss of reasoning
that no longer relies upon empirical truth for verification
and validation of processes, and instead 'shared belief'
and a 'superior knowing' takes this place, without anchor
to truth outside a binary simplism, yet beyond correction
for its errors, because they can be ignored, denied, and
the other side destroyed, as is necessitated ideologically;
one side must lose for the other side to win, these "rules"
blackflag would counter this coup and takeover of the state
by a hostile invading population by regaining legal control
over its decision-making and accounting for events in terms
of accountable truth, not allowing secrecy and privilege to
stand-in for assurances of 'good intentions' underneath it all,
at the same time those opposed to institutionalized criminality
are being weeded out of civilization one by one, via surveillance
and attacks against basic existence and subsistence, those
of the traitorous state having been empowered by the takeover
to go the next step, the purging of dissenters and dissidents,
of any who threaten their agenda, privatizing the public realm
and denying services to those not of their shared demographic
in this way, so too, US taxes serving this group primarily as
others go without or are attacked by these same services,
health care becoming administering of disease and death,
social services to increase helplessness and incapacitation,
maximizing profits while engineering conditions impossible
to survive, thus crushing the life out of those at the bottom
and making each year more difficult than the last, death as
if a gift, it cannot arrive early enough, genocide as if mercy
my first attempt at conveying these ideas was to recolor the
US flag as all black while retaining its stars and stripes as
the structure[3]. the problem with this was that it revealed
the ideological formatting of the state, in its rigid lines and
ordering that are the manifestation of this corruption of the
historic compact between individuals & larger organization,
and how governance at the top requires imprisoning those
below, as part of the warped structural dynamics relied upon
and thus injustice built-into the system, its foundation, this
notably in 'mankind' as the shared identity, this privatized
viewpoint scaled to the public allowing any individual to act
in pure selfishness without regard or responsibility to others-
this enshrined in law, outdated as viewpoint, 'the public' does
not exist in this state beyond an 18 century notion, and this
is exactly how this corruption is allowed operate today, by
not acknowledging this condition and correcting it in law-
which requires logic, 3-value and N-value logic, to prove
the binarist viewpoint wrong though also immoral, illegal,
unethical, and yet this very 'reasoning' is forbidden today.
i began to sew, having a black nylon technical fabric,
the goal being to generate a more accurate structure for
the flag that would reflect or in some way represent the
actual dynamics of truth within society, these ideals and
principles of the US constitution in a shared human context,
where both men and women are equal as citizens, and that
people operate in different conditions yet function together
as part of a larger dynamic, an ecosystem that becomes
the state via a decentralized and distributed organization,
scaling from local to national if global contexts, conditions,
situations, aligned via shared dimensions, truth as value
the flag that resulted [4] has a slightly different symbology.
there are many stars, points of light, though some of these
become larger stars via their connected patterning (that is,
points connect or scale up into larger star structures, and
some may be separated at any moment & other combined)
the goal was to demonstrate that constellations of people
or ideas can form, amongst points of individuals, organize
into patterned structures that form a basis for shared order,
and while in the photograph of the flag it is not visible, there
are various regions or boundaries for these relations/events,
where some of these points and stars exist within the same
limits and others exist beyond or outside a given threshold.
(there were additional close-up photos though i do not have
most any of my work archived, though the language of the
zigzag stitching defined these various regional boundaries,
that then translates into near or far within larger ecosystem)
add to this then the linking or networking of these 'stars',
that for me are based on the butterfly paper clamp and also
on the star as a high-voltage transmission pylon or tower, in
this way, structural interconnections can be conceptualized
as -p-o-w-e-r-l-i-n-e-s- and also as the invisible lines that link
together constellations invisibility mapping out the night sky
as stars and structures relate, and capture or model meaning,
to include helping with navigation, awareness, and worldview
in this sense pattern recognition is structural, foundational,
and connections and relations between people in shared truth
is this larger empirical awareness, emerging from relativistic
scenarios, as truth is aligned amongst people and related to
and through, in changing dynamics, shared state as circuitry
and information processor, logical reasoning and organization,
this _ground-up leveling of awareness, ideas, intent, action,
virtue, truth, justice, development, higher purpose, ideals
in this way, so too, power delivery, locally to regionally and
how it scales based upon its shared relation with truth and
those who serve it, as this contrasts with the US flag and
its institutionalization where such dynamics are disallowed,
and people are silenced in these relations, truth vanquished,
something else taking hold, terrorizing citizens in its place
this call for the blackflag to rise and replace the corrupt
US government by legal means, regaining control of the
failed state via constitutional right, then is a challenge to
the reigning falsity that rules and politically 'governs', using
its power against citizens to secure its power indefinitely,
relying on illegal means and methods beyond accountability
due to secrecy and privacy that only applies to oppressors,
while such protections are removed for enemies and used
to exploit and force the downfall of those who live here
the language then may become shared, that yes, such
high insanity must be acknowledged and thus the charade
can be further extended to allow continuing control as these
subversive others continue to attempt to control the reins of
state action, at any cost. and thus mimicry could exist that
seeks to 'represent' this cause via a traditional mindset that
is corrupted by ideology and "believes" something other than
what is said, serves some unacknowledged agenda or view,
that is only camouflaged by the flag, and thus is assumed
to retain control, whatever the shifting dynamics by relying
on the same structures to persist, whatever the new color
in this way, the blackflag yet another false flag for these
traitors who would exist alongside those involved, grounded
within this structural awareness of truth, its transparent and
logical accounting beyond skewed binary onesidedness. a
realm of imposters, mimics, cheats and frauds thus would
continue and yet to juxtapose, compare and contrast these
dynamics, it should be clear that 'the rationale' is entirely
different for these two flags [5], they are not the same idea,
and do not sustain the same beliefs, principles, or ordering
they are actually set against one another in this very moment,
as changes begin to be wrought and pressures exist that still
constrain such actions, based upon resistance, power and
authority based on forbidding what is best for human citizenry
the ideological grid of the present is a cage, a prison camp
purpose-built for human holocaust whereby truth is denied
and eventually outlawed, nonexistence as the present day,
people trapped and existing inside an illusion, not living, only
trying to sustain themselves, keep breathing in the cemetery
in this condition, this separation into many, the individual parts
begin communicating, realize connections in grounded truth
that establish this empirical framework needed, and it involves
taking down the walls built by the state, its prison bar stripes
and false-stars and false-constellations based on emulation,
the state as hollywood movie production, leaders as actors
playing a role on the world stage, versus addressing issues
that exist and being held accountable for such 'representation'
driven by taxation that grows this machinery while seeking to
extinguish citizens inside who do not obey or are the enemy
of those with power. that is what can be seen within various
signs and symbols, language, calculus, patterns & geometry
the difference between these flags is the difference between
ideas and ideology, shared truth versus shared falsity and lies,
freedom versus imprisonment, responsibility versus greed and
unfettered selfishness, duty in opposition to vanity and frivolity,
the network versus the grid, being vs. nothingness, humanity
versus antihumans, individuals vs. institutions, democracy of
human citizens versus corporate democracy, empirical reality
versus relativistic madness, and philosophy versus psychiatry
the existing US flag is the embodiment of politics that replace
the truth with its antithesis which becomes a basis for power,
the blackflag is all about governance, between people who
create and compose the larger state via empirical reasoning
that is based in truth, accounted for and error corrected by
logic, and held accountable and required to change, improve
its functioning, not given the right to ignore its obligations to
people, life, nature, and the larger order it is situated within
the delivery of power will one day arrive, deliverance from this
corrupted condition, within a organized coherent agenda that
regains control over this automated machinery serving wrong
principles and wrong ideas and wrong thinking and beliefs.
there are two orders, represented by these flags. one of
them is aligned with falsity and serves it for its own benefit.
the other serves truth, firstly and wholeheartedly. it is about
how the constitution of a person aligns with those around them
and how this scales and relates and is represented by the state.
the false have their flag. recoloring it is not going to change
anything structural, which is required for the oppression and
exploitation to continue. it can only and must be destroyed as
an institutionalized structure to regain control over the failed state,
as the US constitution outlines and allows. the nature of truth is
conceptualized in the other flag, its blackness has depth and
grounding in principles that reflect those of its people and those
who sacrifice and serve, for greater truth and higher principles
than the base and monetary as if the meaning of life eternal
in other words, no longer will the body govern over the mind,
no longer will the grid determine the network, nor ideology
the truth of ideas. and indeed there is a binary condition
that exists in this situation- between truth and pseudo-truth,
where actual truth grounds to 1 and pseudo-truth to falsity (0).
in this way there is only one value, it is truth. all or nothing.
the US state needs to be brought under constitutional control,
destroy the existing dictatorship, and draft a new constitution
i for one stand against the ongoing criminality of the state
and vote the military take control of its functioning to secure
its actions from those hostile to human citizens and our future

@_subject: conceptual theatre 
in times like these you might expect there would be
music about what is going on, films investigating the
concepts (many quite good actually), other activities,
painters painting (a few) and so on, to establish depth
to conversation and communication instead of enforcing
ideological limits and functioning in limited parameters,
reinforcing traditional feedback loops corruption relies upon
especially plays, literature. perhaps some of the latter in
its detachment or documentary aspects or parallels yet
where is the cultural insight of those most free on earth-
why the silence when searching for 'play on surveillance'
that would have theater delving into realm of importance
and providing critique, frameworks to evaluate ongoing
situations within, instead of- well, seemingly nothing.
- of - the - most - free - people - in - the - entire - world -
with nothing to say or views to share about this situation,
not using their rights or freedoms -- adding up to nothing
fucking disgraceful. shameful, self-indulgent, self serving
hypocrisy. as if bureaucracy must sign off on everything.
no allowable risk. disneyification of the entirety of culture,
endless reruns of previous ideas and interpretations yet
no one with enough insight to frame this given picture?
or is it fear that holds people back, silence is safety
no one willing to take a stab at it, and then another
to regain a space and place lost to complacency and
lack of will, responsibility, greater purpose than money
certainly playwrights of the past would have engaged,
though what about direct engagement, for understanding
to model the situation and evaluate it as only theater
can do, to create other atmospheres that capture these
situations and make what is ineffable due to abstractness
tangible, realized, understood, and relatable through use
of actors and storytelling and stage and props, scenery
my contribution to this, as a structural idea for plays
about surveillance society, free for use as a concept:
that a stage with one person, at other times two people
(or more) could exist as if on a basketball court, whereby
bleachers would exist on either side of the main area
1) this could involve a central stage with two bleacher wings,
splayed out facing an audience as if vanishing perspective
2) else it could be an actual school gymnasium with large
bleachers where a theatric performance takes place
see: concept for stage design and structure for play
here is the idea. people in the bleachers are surveillers,
they may either sit on the sidelines, and then aspects of
the play could move in parallel in these other dimensions
(geospatial, store tracking, license scanning, credit card
history, database mining and advertising, listening to calls
and keyword mapping, metadata, tracking receipts, etc)
in version 1 (above) they would then be functioning the
_background, otherwise invisible to the people in the center
of their daily lives, behind this hidden threshold of rules, laws,
language that forbids understanding of this condition at the
same time it defines the existence and actions of the people
warping or skew of data, the hypocrisy of tracking details by
companies or reselling of data, public-private profit strategies,
extortion, blackmail, political abuse, marketing, web adverts,
social network mapping, any of this commentary introduced
into this position of the actors at center stage as they relate
with others, such as using the phone or a computer, as this
links to people or topics, 'feedback' as various events occur
in version 2 (above) the same dynamics could occur though
with plants in the audience, sitting amongst others in the
bleachers, perhaps people wearing all black suits, dark
glasses, holding strange equipment, and instructions for
those in the bleachers to relay messages (the telephone
game) where a signal is passed along regular routes and
thus input is transformed by output, then passing this data
back into the play, as improvisation. for instance, a "secret"
could be passed into the bleachers by an informant, and
then by a defined route, 10 or 15 people in a given line or
sequence (marked by graphics) could be part of this flow
of data, having to relay what they heard one to the next,
to get the data to the black suited mystery people, and
thus the message they receive is then output as signal
back into the play, to those center stage or others who
are inacting with it, such that 'traveling to sign-ville' then
becomes 'unraveling the dollar bill' when later output, etc
thus, this kind of conceptual format would allow creative
expression and exploration of issues, perhaps it would
be best and most informed by technical consultation
with privacy or security and-or other experts, including
data from those surveilled, such that a larger sense of
what this involves could be sketched for citizens so that
its impact and importance could be gauged in a context
of daily living, to what extent this data gathering and this
tracking and watching is going on, and what principles it
is currently be driven by and how laws do not exist that
can constrain its functioning against citizens day to day,
and that everyday situations involve these dimensions
and issues of privacy, security, and such exploitations
playwrights have the unique skills to convey such
cultural messages and raise consciousness, and do it
in a memorable and intriguing and innovative way. where
is the equivalent of the Snowden of playwrights, perhaps
such a format could be reinterpreted by a dozen or more
playwrights, from varying angels or degrees or settings.
what if the structure is modular, and can add, subtract,
or modify the ideas of other plays using this structure,
and thus open or free source the play for interpretative
exploration and development. it is the information and
the perspective that is important, the truth of what is
going on. theaters are places for living ideas, not the
continual regurgitation of those dead and lifeless as if
highest value or truth. there is missing data of today,
who is willing to approach to present and convey what
it involves, using all the resources available to transmit
important information and ideas, start and sustain the
conversation beyond its existing, stifling boundaries
freedom does not exist if it is not made use of. and
it goes away if seeking permission to do something,
because somewhere along the line it may involve risk.
but isn't it worth trying to do something and seeing what
the real situation is, and then knowing from that, then to
not even try, not even do anything, and supposed to know
by not taking it on, accepting defeat without ever fighting
there have got to be some playwrights willing to take
on these issues. if they exist, hopefully so, it would be
interesting to see what such plays involve in their content
and approaches to conveying and conceptualizing issues
of cyberspace, hacking, surveillance, attacks, and so on

conceptual structure and provide a format to explore such ideas via
advanced viewpoints and perspectives otherwise lacking or absent in their
parallelism, as situations coexist in simultaneous, interacting hidden

@_subject: [cryptography] To Protect and Infect Slides 
a few observations related to the video presentation:
1) often hear issues about legitimacy of mass surveillance in relation to
'targeted surveillance' as delineator, whereby legitimate targeting is
afforded to actual threats to the state and its required security measures
that likely involves way more in the realm of reasoning and undocumented
information than people are aware of, to determine whether or not a threat
exists and if such measures are necessary in terms of state security.
thus, surveilling of individuals who are problematic (either as actual foes
- aka terrorists, dangerous criminals, spies - or those wrongly-categorized
though falling into this same catch-all category) yet where oversight or
high fidelity review may not exist and thus reasoning may be weak for who
is targeted along with those who are legitimate threats.
meaning: in the talk the group or category of 'Muslims' were mentioned as
surveillance targets, though perhaps not all of these, yet in relation to
profiling, it would suggest mass surveillance could exist in certain
communities moreso than in others. in that the individual scales into a
group target, the weighting of probability perhaps moving higher in certain
demographic characteristics shared as part of a threat model outline. so
too, activists against business interests and so on, depending upon how
privatized the surveillance model is, what it is being used for, how it is
leveraged for political agendas, etc.
and so oftentimes in the mainstream viewpoint it tends to be that the
targets that tend towards some fraction of 1% of the population are likely
legitimate targets (say, 0.00001%) so that, as an example, a US population
of 314 million people has around 3,139 actual threats that would justify
surveillance measures in terms of their violent activities that threaten to
undermine the state or pursue terrorist actions against the population
(unless false flag engineered, etc).
and here is my contention with this view, and how a category such as
'ethnicity' or 'religion' may indicate there are other potential dynamics
that legitimate mass surveillance, and so it may be a fallacy to uphold
this perspective, that only some fraction of 1% are justifiable for
targeted surveillance and not dragnets over the entire population--
because, what if instead the threat involves an invading force, an
occupation, where the opponent tends towards 30% to more than 50% or more,
so that it could be 150 million people and those they are related to that
require tracking and further analysis. and that this is the more likely
threat model, in certain scenarios, depending on how it is calculated. and
could also exist as a paradox, where 'both sides' use the same or similar
surveillance to track opponents, though with different ends such that the
NSA is not a monolithic ideological organization and could be involved in a
deception campaign whereby there is a 'sandbox' for a pretend-NSA operating
as if the NSA, inside the larger organization and this is the context for
issues of who is surveilled, how surveillance is occurring, state- and
world-level honey traps, bear traps, monster traps, and so on.
in plain sight i think there are conditions of a civil war at world scale
and this is the threat model, and there is rotten surveillance that is
driven by the corrupt state, and a surrogate or pretend-NSA at the helm,
itself corrupted yet also contained, and then another threat model that is
monitoring all of this activity via surveillance at the scale of 50% or
greater of the population, in great and intricate detail, that remains
legitimate. and so, a vast forward strategy yet that is invisible, and a
smaller corrupt forward strategy that will be made visible in its
corruption. (set(subset)) dynamics.
in that this complex approach maps to military strategy of the early into
late 20th century, including the aftermath of WWII and politics of Vietnam
war in cultural terms extended into the present, and in terms of
{superset}, millennia of strategic planning likewise, setting up a false
order in order to take it down in an open-source context of Armageddon.
2) it seems bizarre that NSA activities are confined to computer technology
and there is yet no mention of behavioral dimensions to hacking, including
neurological attacks using em tools and weaponry. in that psychologists,
neurologists, psychiatrists and others vital information to hacking people
who are targeted, to program or force into disrepair. for instance, certain
chemicals can enter into the body via food supply and then be triggered via
signals and electromagnetic fields, activating them via remote switch.
chemicals in food supply then like junk dna that allows such custom
targeting at a distance, say via hostile management of infrastructure,
beyond normal rules, boundaries. the realm of mindwarfare and psychological
war, information operations at the covert level _must be tied to this same
NSA infrastructure manipulation if existing and attacking populations, yet
why is it disregarded as part of this context, why is the very direct
connection between EM tech and EM human physiology disregarded a priori as
an attack vector and not dealt with in the human rights context it should
exist within by default, if made readily aware that such dynamics are
inherent- not anomaly - to this aggressive surveillance, goals of behavior
modification, etc.
3) this leads to the issue of how this technology is fielded. if it exists,
the quickest and most distribributed, efficient route for an eight-mile
distant attack would be the cellular tower infrastructure that already
exists. that would turn it from a manual operation with field agents on
site or locally, to an issue of remote administration of these tools and
their automation, such that any person (tending towards 50% of population
model, say) could be attacked, and that it is not a tiny fraction and
instead every single device that could be scaled to the highest threat
model as need be, and thus whatever tools exist to do this would need to
exist in a context of mass surveillance, not individual cases that are few
and far between, because if that is not the nature of the actual threat,
why would tools be restricted in their use to a less-than-necessary
deployment. and thus automated infrastructure deployment seems probable in
this regard.
4) in this way, so too, neurological weaponry and behavior modification
hacking tools would likely coexist in a similar context if deployed and in
use, much more serious than attacking inert tools and equipment. attacking
peoples - citizens - nervous systems and minds, driving people into ill
health or conditions of psychological/physiological torture via these same
technical means, perhaps a sub-branch of NSA or co-use via CIA special
programs or other military venture, yet hostile to citizenry, operating in
a faulty or infallible threat model, exploited by onesided politics of
hidden  dictatorship and so on. that level of realism does not yet exist
though certainly some measure of these hostile tools exist hidden within
the same infrastructure - deployed and leveraged by the corrupt overseers,
so when will Snowden or other documents enter into the neurological and
other health aspects of hacking, cracking, pwnage, etc. that is, invisible
death squads sitting like chess pieces on the city grid, awaiting orders to

5) another realization upon hearing the 30c3 talk of Jacob Appelbaum
was the 'earth firewall' then indicates that the NSA controls the internet,
and that it is not operating as a subset within it, and instead everything
that occurs is within its domain....
the earlier belief, even in context of Arpanet origins...
    ( "the Internet" (NSA activities) )
when instead, a more realistic scenario in terms of who controls the
technical infrastructure, aka the foundation of cyberspace...
     NSA (the internet)
this makes a world of difference, because then national networks and
technological development occur 'inside' the framework of NSA and it
essentially governs or manages production of equipment, backdoors
installed, and if corrupt, loss of law within that same context that can
and does served warped political goals, attacking political opponents,
dissidents, those against the ruling ideology. technology allowing this.
    NSA (the internet (countrycodes) )
in this way, a corrupt NSA with dictatorial agenda could have established
default control, and enact, develop, extend hidden political organization
via secret or overt manipulations that gain and secure, solidify power yet
which exist beyond law, 'external governance', even within the state itself
    NSA is god, essentially. having rooted earth and its inhabitants.
    // if technical jargon is correct for a non-programmer
   ...and yet does not observe external truth, adhere to or recognize
   shared laws of the state, the US constitution, and other agreements
   that bind the state to its people, in service, versus in exploitation.
in this way, state violence could be automated, mechanized against
populations that somehow believe the NSA is contained and not the
entity doing the containing. like there is an unrecognized role-reversal
by the corrupt entity in a power grab related to hidden, secret US coup

it is my belief that 'context is everything' applies to the review
of these same issues and ideas, especially: location^3
consider issues of mass surveillance and mass deployment
of technical means and measures, for saturation potential so
that getting to the target is a non-issue, zero cost essentially
once installed (the role of infrastructure, resolving such issues
by providing a managed platform that readily automate tasks)
consider 'integrated surveillance' tools and capabilities in a
blackbag context. really think a fleet of a 100 tempest vans
exist in every city, or do the economics work against this as
a scalable approach and require instead cellular towers or
wi-fi antennas as a base for such activities to occur. and if
this were possible, would it not be integrated to N-degrees
of capability? consider electronic door locks in a context of
black bag jobs. what if a remote software command could
more easily unlock a car via cellular tower than a person,
and invisibly, (this prior to them driving you off the road in
autonomous or driverless vehicles, exciting future awaits)
so is psychological warfare and other information operations
by default assumed to involve teams on the ground or is it
potentially seamlessly integrated with existing infrastructure
and streamlined as another protocol layer that can or will be
deployed as or if needed, in terms of threat escalation and
what is legitimated in the given corrupt/illegal approach. if
assuming it involves people going from point A to B there
is little likelihood of these activities being deployed at the
scale of mass surveillance, and yet if infrastructure itself,
there is high likelihood or it is probable that they could be
made economical and exist as a potential to be used as
weapons against populations though may only target a
few individuals in the existing context, potentially, thus
0.00001% for more extreme and oppressive measures
may be accurate, in that what is hacked becomes the
person themselves, say via forced disease triggering or
whatnot, as part of this context of hostile surveillance
that in active and passive ways could still be deadly,
just slow drip, over time, versus out-in-the-open where
such attacks could be documented, proven to exist

In practice, it is pretty obvious that most practitioners of civil
It seems in practice that there is a relation issue involved in
who judges and determines lawfulness in the shared situation.
oftentimes, the person who judges is actually 'the criminal' and
can "represent the state" and 'the people' though misleadingly,
subverting this relation. such that, a person who exists within
and operates in a criminal way, including relying upon lies as
a day to day framework, then convicts those who may break
one law or tell one lie in their lives or go beyond a boundary
out of principle and larger ethics that question the ruleset
and what happens or appears to is that all the power is with
those who cheat, lie, and steal within the state along with
their accomplices, and that these people 'are the state' that
then judges and determines the fate of otherwise law-abiding
citizens or those who seek to serve its best interests, not least
by enforcing its framework or utilizing its freedoms, testing the
parameters only to find they are not observed, are fiction only
(else, perhaps other more active strategies exist though are
correct in principle, in not adhering to laws that are inaccurate
or overbearing and allow the corruption its continuing power)
what this is to suggest is that the judge-convicted relation is:
    99.99% falsity + 0.01% truth   vs.  99.99% truth + error
(in that the evaluation occurs in a warped framework where
judgement is divorced from its own adherence to truth, via
the same corrupted constitution that allows for this relation)
    99% wrong  ---> judgement ---> 0.01% wrong
and yet this viewpoint (based on power) is itself based upon
LIES and deception, unaccountable to the same rules and
thus is beyond law. and thus it _must show falsity in another
yet never allow this to be accounted for in its own viewpoint
or actions-- which is how authoritarian, totalitarian, and the
secret dictatorship triumph in these conditions, because it
is beyond accountability, it is just about believing in higher
power that is based on lies and opinions, as it filters down
into culture via illiteracy, loss of education, social relations,
normalization of vice, oppression, exploitation, criminality
this is why the state must be abolished, because it has
become thoroughly rotten from the inside out due to the
outdated source code that provides loopholes to oppress
citizens and humans and the planet and animals worldwide
due to loss of truth, and making this lying 'legal' as a basis
for 'shared power' by who shares and is in on the lie, as this
then scales and becomes organization, authority, judgement

re:    99% wrong  ---> judgement ---> 0.01% wrong
this is also how 'masters of the drug war' convict
entire generations to subservience and obeyance via
mass surveillance, a threat of pending prosecution
by the very people who engineered the war of drugs
against their own populations to gain total power
via cutting off, neutralizing generations below them
and using a false and unreal ethical framework to
then judge and prosecute political enemies lists
thus solidifying the ruling dictatorship, OOSOOM
(i.e. drug lord determines drug user bad for society
if they challenge authority, use legal rights, etc)

strange-read-reply function, to paraphrase:
In practice, it is pretty obvious that most practitioners of civil
it is the problem of analysis: focus on the person who takes a gun
and shoots people, not on the pills they were prescribe, the failed
institutions surrounding them, etc. too simplistic, inaccurate model
does not distinguish symptoms from disease, allows it to continue
(lose accurate, empirical logical reasoning, no way to address this,
thus loss of language, no matter encrypted comms, this situation;
because it cannot be modeled or related to in realistic framework,
and thus short-circuits into power games and political engineering,
which is inherently violent and leads to those terms of resolution)

i was thinking about 'hidden powerline networking' as a threat
the other day. basically anything that could be plugged into a
socket with hidden one-way networking on chip, that would
be able to siphon network data or use as a sensor or bug &
send this data into a larger circuit, say apartment electrical
wires that could be picked up remotely as frequencies that
are outside ordinary spec, at another onsite location such
that a device simply is plugged into the same site to reveal
or tap into the data. i imagine this is completely TRIVIAL
to accomplish, especially due to no regulatory/enforcement
or consumer protections in a security or commercial context
as it aids surveillance goals, especially in political framework
of secret policing, informers, etc. spying by the populations.
such that anything with a cord potentially could feed such
data, if designed this way. speakers or router or monitor or
printer or clock or lights or blender or microwave, etc. and
that it could seem innocuous, yet have this capacity or this
'surveillance potential' (as in, potential energy vs. applied),
such that grassroots on-site monitoring could be aided and
abetted likewise by such technological compromise, this
in terms of intent and design or perhaps not revealed or
deployed though part of a COT readymade solution that
just requires smd circuitry add-ons to activate functionality
this could be a stupid-model, versus smart expert systems
or total monitoring solutions, the dust mote approach that
leads towards a *density* of surveillance means/measures
what is the square-footage of surveillance in your domain,
etc. how many bugs per cubic meter, what if it was not
one or two and instead, potentially dozens, this beyond
the computer itself, in the realm of what it is possible and
thus a question of where ubiquity may exist when fully
surveilled, to what degree is maximal different in kind
from minimal, such that the garage door opener and
the car and dishwasher and HDTV and phone and the
LED lights and remote-control car are monitoring you,
in addition to computers, cellphone, conversations.
(such as: is your router and neighbors wi-fi being used
as an attack vector, are you being imaged via through-
wall radar via wi-fi, for tracking and monitoring. or being
made ill via out of spec radiation boosting via wi-fi, etc)
