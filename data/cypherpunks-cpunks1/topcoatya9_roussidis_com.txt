i had a really tumultuous teenager-hood i was a happy and smart little kid it was surprising when so much angst welled up inside me all kits are shipped phew
feeling so inspired
i bet that block is not nearly as big as i remember it being but i remember it being quite a trip
different boyfriends came and went through all this some i thought i could marry some i was mad at myself for hanging around some that broke my heart and that made me think of all the insomniatic nights that she stayed up with me and mirrored my every move and snuggled me right out of my anxiety into dreamland long after grant and cate had drifted off
Quilt kits finally all done
one thing i enjoy about facebook is the old pictures that friends and fam upload to walk down memory lane together with you all day the kids hung out at that corner played on that grass got drinks out of that hose went through the secret passage way in the juniper bushes and only left the area to go around the block over and over again sometimes it was on bikes with banana seats sometimes roller skates sometimes big wheels sometimes walking even occasionally on skateboards with cardboard boxes on them (our cars) and i think im done cutting kits for a while
Yummy fabric ready to ship
remember when the weather was warm and we would go to the park when daddy got home from work and we would bring homemade bread and fruit to eat for dinner and we would be drenched in golden light and the cousins would come meet us for some wild rides down the slide i am determined
seriously though my closest friends are fun real and honest good entertaining in love with life a little crazy down to earth deep and incapable of bs
i look for girls with purses that compliment mine
i spent a few hours organizing my yarn and needles into that armoire me um we didnt have disney games when i was five
i do have one faithful companion who is braving the germs penny the pug russell
and how every plan ive ever made has been reconstructed into something harder and better than what i laid out as my own agenda he is the perfect mix to me of blues and folk and funk and feeling
