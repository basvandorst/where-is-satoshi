@_subject: ADMIN: toad.com's mail hicups Tuesday morning... 
The list mailhost, toad.com, had massive problems today with
sendmail queues, resulting in load averages over 90 (on a machine
where 6 is high) and other unfun problems for me to chase.
  To my knowledge no mail was droped on the floor, but some mail did
come out of the machine with headders missing.  I have no idea what
the mail software thought it was doing by droping headers, but I think
we will live even so.
  I am looking at installing some newer software to deal with the
problems of today, though the root causes are solved for now, better
software (sendmail) is called for.
  On the other hand better software is ALLWAYS called for... Guess I
had better get back to doing that sort of work...

@_subject: My key 
I think you miss the point of Public Key Crypto.  The idea is that
you CAN publish your public key, to one and all.  Then when you sign a
post with your private  key (and do work hard to keep that key
private!), then anyone can verify that _you_ (in the guies of your
public/private key pair) wrote the message. No one else can sign a
message such that _your_ public key will decrypt the sig in a valid
way, unless you have let your private key leek out.
  This is the whole wonderful idea that make Public Key crypto so
wonderful.    You are createing a strong and valued Psudonym, and signing your
messages will only make it stronger!  Then there is no way to really
spoof a message from 'Wonderer', as you will be ('Wonderer'*KEY) and a
solid nym-citizen.
  Make sence?

sites world wide where folks can get crypto information and crypto
  Since I know and trust this person, I have offered to post this
notice and collect any posting of such sites (email me or post to
cypherpunks) that anyone feel comfortable sending out.  Please include
a short description of the sorts of information/software on each site
you post, though you don't have to list packages, just an idea of
what's there.

Today the disk that the cypherpunks list lives on filled up, and
then someone try to join the list and the list got zeroed again.
  I am currently installing a new version of MajorDomo and making
changes to prevent this happening (at least we caught it in the act
this time).
  The list will likely be up and down a little bit for the next few
hours or day (hey, I have to sleep sometime! :r) but should be fully
stable again by Tuesday in any case.
  This time I do plan to install a recent backup of the list.
  If you have any questions please email mail, this list it's self
does not need any more crud on it.

I have restored the backup of the list from June 11th, and merged it

  Some list users who signed up again in the last three days are now
signed up twice for the list (due to signing up from a different
machine or having changed your name).  If you are getting two copyies
of the posting to the list, send majordomo at toad.com a "unsubscribe
cypherpunks" command from the machine that you don't want the list
going to.
  If you still have problems after trying that, please contact us via
cypherpunks-owner at toad.com or majordomo-owner at toad.com and we will fix
it by hand.

Humm, seems as I have my work cut out for me tonight, as majordomo
zeroed out the list again and is having problems with it's temp files
(filling up a second disk here at toad.com).
  Eric Hughes and I freed up 15 megs on the disk where majordomo keeps
the cypherpunks list, and I tought that would give me the time to do
the fix right (and speend the weekend not hacking...).  Turns out that
the disk filled up again tonight, this time with 12+ megs of bounce
messages from Cypherpunks subscribers durring the last 9 days.
  Seems we have some major problems to solve still with the basic mail
list technology.
  I have 11 hours to make a major meeting, so I am going to go back to
hacking the software and see how much I can get running tonight.
  I will install a backup from a few days ago, some of you will have
duplacates that we will have to remove yet again, sigh, thats the way
it goes.
  If you have futher questions or problems, please contact me.

@_subject: Well users loose for now 
The Well has two IP feeds into the internet, due to
political/biz_profit/sysadmin problems the two feeds do NOT back each
other up, and the one that can be seen from toad.com has been down for
a few days, thus blocking your email.
  If the feed comes up today, well.com based subscribers to
cypherpunks should get all of the list traffic in one big burst, if it
stays down much longer then the toad.com mailer will start trashing
the older mail (and bug us about each lost message).
  This points to an interesting problem, TCP/IP is very good at
getting data from point A to point B, so good that a month of bombing
by the Department of War does not destroy network conductivity.  Yet
here in the (so very rich) USA we have lots lots of outages to parts
of the net because TCP/IP does not solve the problem of PAYING for
getting packets where they belong.
  This is a protocol issue on two levels, the first is that the idea
of accounting for packets/bandwidth/capacity (in some unknown manner)
was left out of TCP/IP in the first place.  The second is that it is
going to be a very large amount of work to replace the current plant
of TCP/IP hardware and software as none of these protocols are
negotiated, just presumed to be the only way to do things.
  If we build systems like these, then they will be 'brittle' and
might inspire a few folks but not be usable by most, and some other
(large) organization will build what it wants on top of our dreams
  There is little chance that I will ever use a monetary system that
is so brittle that it fails if one link is down or one cypher
unuseable due to it's being cracked by some unscrupulous agency.
  This important subject of protocols is the topic of the next San
Francisco Bay Area Cypherpunks meeting.

@_subject: Notes on getting a business on the Internet 
At the April San Francisco Bay Area Cypherpunks meeting I gave a
talk on what it takes to get a small business on the Internet to
provide some service.  Most of the talk was on very technical gnunk
dealing with telecom equipment & lines as well as finding and starting
up IP service.
  I have been asked many times for the notes, lists and tables I used
in the talk, so after (not enough) editing and some expansion so that
they would make some sense out of the context of the meeting here they
  Do note the new section on Frame Relay, as I got updated on the
changes in Frame Relay after the April meeting.

  If you are thinking of doing that bright new network business idea of
yours, here are a few questions to lead you through some of the maze that
is the networking world of today.  Mostly this note focuses on one of the
middle parts of the problem, getting your self on the net in such a way
that you can provide that great new network service.
  There are many ways to get on today's Internet, and things are
changing fast, what was a good idea or product last month is often the
slow dumb way to do things this month.  Keep asking questions, watch
out for new services and tariff's as they might be much better or
cheaper that what you are planing right now, even if you got it out of
these notes!
  Note that you might be able to buy the networking services you need
from a vendor currently on the net, and this note does not deal with
that.  You can likely also find someone, maybe in the role of a consultant,
who can help you do much of this work, this can be a very valuable
service.   After you are on the net there is much left to do, and hopefully there
are a few useful pointers here to get you going in the right direction.
  This file was built out of my notes for a talk given in April 1994
about how to get a small business on the Internet and providing a
service.  Remember that its usefulness and your mileage will vary.
  Good luck!

*  Getting Hooked Up
**  Get your idea and business structure together first
from the get-go.  Write up your idea, see if others get the idea,
ask them if they would buy (don't stop if they say no, but this gives
you an idea who your market is and is not).
to explain it to many folks along the way (like the folks who are
working for you trying to do it!).
likely is) a huge waste of time and effert, but having a structure
that you can work with as things grow is important.  It just might
keep the government off your back as well.
**  Decide whom your first target market should be
**  What sort of connection do you/they need to each other?
**  Which IP provider do you want to buy from?
put your shiny new service on the Internet your self.  Now you have to
decide on whom to purchase your IP feed from, and that can be tricky
to say the least.
to ask of IP providers, phone company etc.
*** Questions to ask yourself first:
*** Questions to ask prospective IP providers:
**  Get your your self on the net, learn its ways (Netiquette)
news.announce.newusers, it is full of useful information on good
Netiquette.  You can do this by buying a shell or other type of
account that gives you access to the net for email and netnews,
downloading etc. before your biz is on the net.
**  Provide information about your service via the net itself!
business on the Usenet, like advertise your services and/or products.
internet WWW sites, see if you can get yours added.  Places currently
doing such things are eit.com, the GNN (ora.com) and msen.com.
are related to your biz if it's ok to post an informative message
about your service.  Ask (politely!)that a reference to your biz be
added to the lists FAQ if any.
*	Resources
  Here are some random notes, tables and lists that might help you
find things you will need.  Most of this is targeted to the San
Francisco Bay Area, as that is where I have been doing consulting on
these topics, though the basic ideas are useful no matter where you
are doing telecom.
**  An example of comparing IP providers
  Below is some info that I collected in the process of setting up
a site to go in the internet.  First there is an example of collecting

"When What Goes Where: Good Networking Protocol Hygiene"
  When designing, coding and testing programs we are confronted with a
myriad of choices as to how various parts of the solution communicate.
Much is known about how to design 'protocols' that are flexible,
debugable & robust.
  We are currently encoding cryptographic protocols in our systems and
networks at a furious rate, yet there are new challenges in keeping such
systems robust, secure and sometimes even anonymous.
  I hope to touch on some of the well known tricks and dangers, what
is new when cryptographic and anonymous systems are combined with
todays systems and where we might learn from the past.
"Sendmail as a Multiplexor."
           Eric Hughes   The basic architecture of sendmail is a recognizer and a dispatcher.
These two elements provide a good framework for designing systems that
can be changed piece by piece.  Even when a facility seems to have
stabilized, it's often a good idea to keep the flexible framework
around for future experimentation and expansion.
"Announcement of CryptDisk v1.0"
  CryptDisk (for the Macintosh) is an example of the kinds of [mostly]
transparent strong crypto that we need.  Integrated smoothly with the
operating system, CryptDisk provides IDEA encryption on a block
read/write level for a virtual hard disk.  It's beauty lies mainly in
that it does exactly what the user expects and requires no more setup
than remembering a pass-phrase.  Source code is available upon
request.  Warning:  Some governments might consider this software a
"Munition", not suitable for "private possession" by free peoples.
"Stream-oriented, analysis-resistant public-key protocols over UDP"
  Many cypherpunks projects have a need to reliably transmit
variable-length (sometimes quite long) data over unreliable
networks. TCP lends itself to traffic analysis and is not well-suited
for use in a hypothetical system of packet laundries that would lead
to packets within a particular stream appearing to come from a variety
of sources.  We have designed and are currently implementing a
UDP-based, hidden-streams protocol that utilizes fixed-length blocks
and pseudo-random sequence numbering to provide reliable,
stream-oriented services to higher-level applications despite
extremely creative routing and laundering of packets.
Raph Levien  & KT Kislitzin   PGP is getting a major upgrade soon, some of the team doing the
work will talk about the motivations and directions the work is
going in.

@_subject: ADMIN: List wipeout and recovery 
Yeghads, it happened again.  Last night at about 22:47 the disk
partition that holds the cypherpunks mail list filled up and when
someone tryed to sub/un-scribe using Majordomo the list got zeroed.
  No one broke into the system to do any evil, it's just confusion,
rotten software and poor management by yours truley that casued the
  Next problem was that toad.com had changed a lot in the last 9
months, and we had moved things about in such a way that I did not
seem to have any backups of the file!  Today our gracious host, John
Gilmore called up to see what the problem was and if there was any way
to fixit.  Using two heads was better than one and we realized that we
had a online backup only 2 days old.  Minutes later it was installed
and the list is back to where it was late on 1995/07/11.
  So, some of you will need to un-subscribe again, our apologies about
that.  I will dig out the lost messages and make a digest-ish like
post of everything that was posted since about 22:30 last night.
  I will also look at moving away from MajorDomo as list software due
to its being moribund, old, stupid and bothersome!
  Thanks also goes to L. McCarthy  for sending
pleasant email to the right folks (majordomo-owner at toad.com is best)
to lets us know that there was a problem.
  If you have any questions please send them directly to me as the

If I (or any software I write) remove a user from the
 list the users entry now gets appended to the
culled.users file.  Since I was keeping a list anyway, I have set it
up so that anyone can email/download the list of recently culled
cypherpunks via majordomo.
  If you stop getting your CP drug for too long, before sending a note
to the list(shame!) ask for this file to see if I culled you.  If you
forget how to get a file send a help message to .
  Here is a quick (emacs) example of how to get the file:
and the file will show up soon.  This is a very boring file (dates and
email addresses).
  You might want to save this message away, so you will have it to

The monthly meeting of any Cypherpunks in the San Francisco Bay area

  We are going to try meeting in back of the Tresidder Union at
Stanford University in the court yard (by the elevator tower).
  Tresidder Union is a little (peninsula) west of the Stanford main
Quad, there is a parking lot just p-west of of the Union that you can
park in on weekends.  The best automotive access is from the west via
Junipero Serra Blvd. (also called Foothill Expressway, Santa Cruz Ave
& Alameda De Las Pulgus) into the 'back' of the Stanford Campus, look
it up on a map folks.  For some semi-useful maps try:
  There is a chance we will get a room to meet in, in that case there
will be a sign/person telling you where to go.  If not there is a
raised area in the court yard (under the tree) that will be the
gathering area.  In the case of rain (and no room) we will meet in the
pub in the (peninsula) south west corner of the Union.
  If you have things you want to talk about at this meeting, or can

      of blocks away.)
  - LEFT on 20th.
     (The very first traffic light after exit ramp. Taco Bell on left).
  - RIGHT turn at next stop sign (Palm St.).
  - PROCEED 1.5 blocks.
     (Parking Garage entrance at rear of Bayview building is on your right.)

.................................. NANO ...................................
+ Once you've parked your flying saucer in the Garage:
  - STAIRS (or Elevator) to the main level, step out and...
  - WALK WEST across the courtyard to the main (tallest) building.
  - PASS through the doorway in the stand-alone exterior "glass wall"
      and approach the "information" window (also the guard station) on
      the north side of the building.
  - GET the guard's attention (preferably *not* by waving a firearm).
      Use the passwords ("PGP" or "cypherpunks") and you'll be admitted.
      If the guard's on a break, call my cellphone 415.730.3583.
  - ELEVATOR to 2nd Floor.
     (The meeting room is on left side, slightly down the hall)
      PGP's offices are on the 9th Floor (soon the 10th too).
For CalTrain-ers, get off at the San Mateo station near the Bay Meadows
horse racing track and head for the tallest building around with the huge
"Bayview" sign on top.
For the bus, take any line running on El Camino Real to the intersection of
20th in San Mateo and dismount. You're there.
