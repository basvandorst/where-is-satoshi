Dear Joe,
   Thank you for interest in joining Better A Millstone. To receive an application send a request to the following: applyforbam at hotmail.com
along with your primary e-mail address and one will be sent to you.
   I'm afraid that you should not celebrate to much because even as I am writing this to you boychat is trying to get reestablished so our work is never done. We must be ever vigilant to protect our children from these perps who prey on our greatest resource - our children.
   If you were watching Americas Most Wanted last night, there is a Dutch pedophile group that is trying to protect Erik Rosser who is wanted by the FBI on charges of molesting his girl friends daughter. He has been on the run out of the country and he is still committing unspeakable acts against children in Spain.
   I ask you to keep your eyes open when you are on the internet for any forms of child pronorgraphy and report the websites to us immediately. You may reach us at the address you used or you may contact me at the address below. We thank you for assisting us in protecting our children. Feel free to cantact us any time.

Dear Mr. Echols,
Congratulations on finally putting those awful BoyChat people
out of business.  My whole family feels safer now that those
sick pedophiles no longer have a place to gather and exchange
information on how to molest children.
I hadn't realized, until I read the recent issue of Newsweek,
how pedophiles had multiplied and now threaten almost everything
we hold sacred.
I'd appreciate it if you could send me information on your
organization, and on how I can help put other pedophiles sites
out of business like you did with BoyChat.  I have a little
money saved up, and I can think of no better cause to spend it
God Bless you Mr. Echols, for the wonderful work you are doing
to protect our children, and may the Lord guide you in bringing
us the final solution to the pedophile problem.
Sincerely yours,
Joe Cypherpunk

Dear Joe,
As far as Erik Rosser in concerned, he made his mark in Tailand and Taiwan. He took videos with him having sex with preteen girls, some as young as 8 or 9. Yahoo clubs is a haven for hosting club that cater to pedophiles wishing to swap pictures of child porn. All you need to do is become a member using a false e-mail address (I suggest you set one up through hotmail. Yes this is totally legal) so you can gather information on those clubs. If you do this, keep track og the URL's of the clubs and turn this information over to us so we can check these clubs out and get those perps busted. As soon as you receive your application, fill it out and return it to the address provided in the e-mail you receive. If I may ask, do you have a background working with children and if so, what do you do? We look foward to receiving your application. If your application is approved, (in this business, we must check out all new members throughly. This is for all concerned) you will receive an e-mail from Mr. Echols giving you useful and valuable information on how to carry out your work with BAM. You will also be given the names of of three Assistant Executive Directors, along with Mr. Echols, are experienced with working with new members. All of use are glad to work with new members until they get their "feet wet" and can handle being on their own. Please feel free to contact me at the address below or at the address you just used if you have any more questions.

Dear Mr. Terry,
Thank-you for responding so quickly to my earlier email.
It is disheartening to learn that BoyChat is trying to reestablish
itself.  Our children are indeed, as you said, out greatest resource,
and no effort is too great to prevent them from being preyed upon
by perps.
I did have one question, which I forgot to include in my earlier
message, however.  I read a message on another chat board saying
that BoyChat was down from a "Massive DDoS Attack."  What kind of
attack is that, and is it something BAM will teach me when I join
so that I can make pedophile sites go down too?
I didn't catch America's Most Wanted last night, but it makes me
physically ill to think of the unspeakable acts Mr. Rosser is doing
to the children in Spain.
I haven't see any child pronorgraphy on the Web yet.  But there is
lots of adult pornography which opens windows in my browser faster
than I can close them and then I have to reboot.
God Bless you and Mr. Echols, and the wonderful work you are doing.
Sincerely yours,
Joe Cypherpunk
