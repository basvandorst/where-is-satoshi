@_subject: ntru-crypto - Open Source NTRU Public Key Cryptography 
Discussion of cryptography and related The GPL doesn't require you to release a cryptosystem under the GPL,
only code for that cryptosystem that derives from GPL'd code. The GPL
in effect is a tragedy-of-the-commons-killomatic: It's an agreement
between me and you saying "I give you my code, if you give it to
others". There's nothing in there about "I offer you my code, and hit
you if you try to write your own instead".
Given that, I have very little time for GPL-haters, because they're
just being whiny bastards. Write your own if you don't like it.
Patents, on the other hand, are a whole different steaming pile of
shit, and NTRU is patented. So, I'm still with you on this one. If
they're somewhere where you can relinquish patents, they should do
that. If not, they should either grant the patents wholly to a public
trust, or put them under the DPL or similar and make an irrevocable
pledge never to use them except defensively, if even that.
Of course, who's to know if you implement or build on NTRU under a
'nym? It remains one of the only cryptosystems that's A) Practical and
B) Quantum-resistant.
Anyone know of any other quantum-resistant algos for *encryption* that
can actually be used today, other than NTRU?

@_subject: Android IMSI Catcher detection 
IDD, I've searched for an Android API for detecting crypto algo for ages and turned up empty. However, you can get the tower ID, so a distributed, communally (cantenna?) verified whitelist of 'good' towers is doable, with automatic disconnection if an unwhitelisted tower connects..?
Can/do IMSI systems spoof tower id: is there anything in GSM to make towers self-verifying? I'm guessing no, in which the above would be very poor.
Also of note is API for signal strength, so a mapping of known towers to expected strength at location XYZ could be used to detect systems used to home in on phones, which usually max out on signal and tell your phone to do likewise. Indeed, a strong signal tower which still asks your phone to dial up the juice should be regarded as an attack.
