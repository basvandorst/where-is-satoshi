should have noted in my original message that this encryption is to meet
a contractual point for a commercial product to be delivered soon.  The
product can have one and one only version to be boxed and shipped and
will be sold internationally.  The encryption portion will be dynamically
linked, so real encryption will be available on the net just not in the box.
