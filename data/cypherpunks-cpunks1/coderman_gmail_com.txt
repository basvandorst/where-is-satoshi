what a fucking mess...
* last week a tweaker out of jail for only a few weeks went around to
our hay growers neighbors and stole all sorts of random crap from
homes up and down the road he lived on.  everything from elk antlers
to hand made arrows for bow hunting, power tools loaded into a wheel
barrow, the most random crap.  the only reason he didn't hit our hay
grower was that last time he stole from them they went to his parents
house and told him "the next time your son steals from my home you'll
be attending a funeral".  now that's closer to an effective solution.

know that Glenn at Centaur/VIA is concerned about perceived pressures
to keep crypto out of processor cores.   consider this rumor but i'd
love to see someone follow up on this story.
with cache/memory timing, differential power analysis, even acoustic
side channels weakening software cipher implementations (and hardware
to a lesser degree) i can't help but wonder why Intel and AMD have not
deployed entropy, digests, block ciphers and Montgomery multipliers in
their cores - it takes very little die space and provides a huge

with that said, i think it's clear that a properly designed crypto
system could be considered secure.  the government still uses AES256
for their top secret datum, and the NSA license of ECC could be
interpreted as a vote of confidence in that PK system.  (or is this
just another ruse? :)

this question has bothered me: why choose a cipher whose
implementation in most circumstances is subject to side channels when
there are others resistant to such attacks?
are side channels in flawed implementations the new backdoor of choice
(since insufficient key space and overt flaws are now unavailable)?
i don't see how hardware tokens / crypto ignition keys prevent human
abuses.  passwords and passphrases are useless (unless coupled with
tokens and used only for liveness detection) and vascular biometrics
are excellent for "who you are" type authentication coupled with
physical key "what you have" based auth.
this doesn't preclude the use of a single cipher though; key
management has always been the bane of strong crypto.
indeed; passwords/passphrases as sole authenticators should die. they
should always be coupled with physical tokens IMHO...

P.P.P.S.  these work well for paying for VoIP service too, which gives

that the transaction for the VoIP gear should be anonymous as well

@_subject: Detect Spying on YOU 
i could see some county sheriff's office doing something stupid like
that with seized evidence perhaps. ("ooh! here's a bookmark labeled
'sekrit stuff', let's check it out!")
but the NSA and any other intelligence agency worth half a shit is
going to have clue.
early this year i was collecting information on telecommunications and
electrical power distribution infrastructure to see how detailed a map
publicly available sources could provide to such facilities and the
trends/assessments possible when combining data sets for pattern
i had a number of custom search tools, bots, and databases built up
internally that pulled large amounts of GIS data, LERG, industry
investments/research, maps, press releases, product catalogues, web
searches, cached documents, etc. (court documents pertaining to
telecom and power industries are full of informative details,
especially when the redaction performed in PDF for confidentiality is
only visibly obscuring text [white on white] while keeping content in
place :)
after about 6 weeks and many 100*GBytes of traffic i noticed a
peculiar echo on my line begin abruptly one day.  i'm off an old
analog switch ESS style in rural oregon and this echo/line noise was
associated with my number only (not others off same CO).
i suspected this was a one way conference / tap, which is completely
undetectable for digital systems but alters the line characteristics
of an analog switched circuit.
this was the only hint ever given that i might be under scrutiny. given the nature of my internet usage and the *.gov sites used (among
others) it would have been clear to anyone watching what i was up to. the data mining programs 'rumored' to be in use by the various
government agencies would be able to detect this type of activity
easily, so i suspect this was visible to somebody.
even still, the only clue, if it is one, was the analog conference on
my line, and this was noticeable only because i'm still hanging off
antiquated analog equipment that is rarely in use today.
while i think honey tokens are an interesting approach to independent
evaluation of intelligence / surveillance process and capability, it
would be incredibly difficult to get any information out of such a
project.  NSA and others are very skilled at the one way function of
information: a lot goes in, very very little ever comes back out, and
even then it is tightly constrained.  (i would guess no other agency
the world over has "least privilege" mastered so thoroughly)
an interesting subject for discussion perhaps, but not really useful
in the real world (tm)...

@_subject: [dave@farber.net: [IP] more on AP Story Justice Dept. 
i would count on it, as it's a good bet the answer is yes rather than no.
i'm working on a one time pad based IPsec key daemon with a similar
purpose to what you describe.  i'll be posting here for feedback when
it's ready but the basic premise is that it provides strong ephemeral
IPsec keying using one time pads previously exchanged between peers. as long as the pads are generated and secured properly[1] you don't
need to care if $TLA has kept your IPsec traffic archives in their
acres of computing machinery.
likewise, if large qubit quantum computers suddenly become feasible or
multi ring GCF gets really fast, you don't need to worry about past
key exchanges (also archived) being compromised, as with pub key based
ISAKMP implementations.
last, such a mode needs no open ports[2], so the attack surface for
remote exploitation is limited to the IP level - only authenticated
traffic is passed up the stack, everything else is dropped.
as long as your OTP's are truly random and never compromised, the key
exchange will be secure and the only way to attack your traffic
remotely will be brute force of AES256.
[1]. securing pads is really the crux of the issue here.  i'm using
modified linux distributions for key generation (a host with no
networking capability - kernel omits all network functionality) and
IPsec termination (boot from CD/DVD, require USB fob / hardware token
+ passphrase for auth to access pads stored in encrypted volume).
[2]. this is true with an explanation: for the initial session ICMP
payloads are sent in the clear (not IPsec) to perform the encrypted
key exchange using OTP's.  once IPsec is initialized, ICMP is also
directed through IPsec via the SPD and future rekeying uses OTP's on
top of the existing IPsec SA.  i'll have more details later but in
short all traffic is authenticated or dropped, most of it
authenticated via IPsec, and the only exception being key exchange via
ICMP which is authenticated via OTP only until the first SA is
the advantage of using OTP's in addition to security is simplicity:
all buffers are fixed size, key material is small (per instance) and
the operations fast (no montgomery multiplication on very large
numbers).  even at a 1Hz rekey interval you could fit a years worth of
key exchange OTP in 100MBytes of storage.
the disadvantage is you probably need hardware entropy generation to
produce the pads in a reasonable time.  i'm using the VIA C5XL and C5P
processors for testing / runtime and these can produce more than
enough entropy for large pads without sucking /dev/random dry.
last but not least, the implicit out of band pad exchange with trusted
peers is reasonable for private group networking and other smaller
networks but would be very difficult to scale to a large organization.
 this is a feature in my eyes, as private group networks are what this
is intended for and meatspace pad exchange a desired requirement to
ensure trust is properly placed.

DWDM certainly makes it more complicated.  Of course, that same
technology allows them to send much more back. (Regarding the single
OC-3 mentioned previously.)
How they process and return the information is indeed the BIG SECRET. The old USSR taps used pods attached to the cables for recording and
were serviced periodically to pick up the collected data.
See also: If you look at the landing sites for various oceanic fiber cables you
will see that a great many of them are on "friendly" territory.  You
can be sure that these lines are tapped.  (Which brings up the issue
someone else mentioned a while ago.  We make a big deal about ECHELON
monitoring satellites, yet no one really cares about the tapping of
landing sites that carry many times more information?  Silly humans)
I presume the fiber tapping submarine is interested mainly in those
cables which don't land on friendly territory or the sections landed
between unfriendly sites. (E.g. not all data goes through all sites)
This would be a reasonable assumption.  But so would a number of other
possible techniques.  The great mystery continues...

Wiretap Whistleblower's Statement
12:25 PM Apr, 07, 2006
Former AT&T technician Mark Klein has come forward to support the
EFF's lawsuit against AT&T for its alleged complicity in the NSA's
electronic surveillance. Here, Wired News publishes Klein's public
statement in its entirety.
Full story: Ex-AT&T Worker Tells Of NSA Op
[  ]
Statement: Mark Klein, April 6, 2006
My background:
For 22 and 1/2 years I worked as an AT&T technician, first in New York
and then in California.
What I observed first-hand:
In 2002, when I was working in an AT&T office in San Francisco, the
site manager told me to expect a visit from a National Security Agency
agent, who was to interview a management-level technician for a
special job. The agent came, and by chance I met him and directed him
to the appropriate people.
In January 2003, I, along with others, toured the AT&T central office
on Folsom Street in San Francisco -- actually three floors of an SBC
building. There I saw a new room being built adjacent to the 4ESS
switch room where the public's phone calls are routed. I learned that
the person whom the NSA interviewed for the secret job was the person
working to install equipment in this room. The regular technician work
force was not allowed in the room.
In October 2003, the company transferred me to the San Francisco
building to oversee the Worldnet Internet room, which included large
routers, racks of modems for customers' dial-in services, and other
equipment. I was responsible for troubleshooting problems on the fiber
optic circuits and installing new circuits.
While doing my job, I learned that fiber optic cables from the secret
room were tapping into the Worldnet circuits by splitting off a
portion of the light signal. I saw this in a design document available
to me, entitled "Study Group 3, LGX/Splitter Wiring, San Francisco"
dated Dec. 10, 2002. I also saw design documents dated Jan. 13, 2004
and Jan. 24, 2003, which instructed technicians on connecting some of
the already in-service circuits to the "splitter" cabinet, which
diverts some of the light signal to the secret room. The circuits
listed were the Peering Links, which connect Worldnet with other
networks and hence the whole country, as well as the rest of the
One of the documents listed the equipment installed in the secret
room, and this list included a Narus STA 6400, which is a "Semantic
Traffic Analyzer". The Narus STA technology is known to be used
particularly by government intelligence agencies because of its
ability to sift through large amounts of data looking for
preprogrammed targets. The company's advertising boasts that its
technology "captures comprehensive customer usage data ... and
transforms it into actionable information.... (It) provides complete
visibility for all internet applications."
My job required me to connect new circuits to the "splitter" cabinet
and get them up and running. While working on a particularly difficult
one with a technician back East, I learned that other such "splitter"
cabinets were being installed in other cities, including Seattle, San
Jose, Los Angeles and San Diego.
What is the significance and why is it important to bring these facts to light?
Based on my understanding of the connections and equipment at issue,
it appears the NSA is capable of conducting what amounts to
vacuum-cleaner surveillance of all the data crossing the internet --
whether that be peoples' e-mail, web surfing or any other data.
Given the public debate about the constitutionality of the Bush
administration's spying on U.S. citizens without obtaining a FISA
warrant, I think it is critical that this information be brought out
into the open, and that the American people be told the truth about
the extent of the administration's warrantless surveillance practices,
particularly as it relates to the internet.
Despite what we are hearing, and considering the public track record
of this administration, I simply do not believe their claims that the
NSA's spying program is really limited to foreign communications or is
otherwise consistent with the NSA's charter or with FISA. And unlike
the controversy over targeted wiretaps of individuals' phone calls,
this potential spying appears to be applied wholesale to all sorts of
internet communications of countless citizens.

indeed; the laundering would be well implemented.  it's unlikely
highly visible raw cash infusions are the mechanism, more likely
ancillary benefits in equipment, "unrelated" contracts, facilities,
and other infrastructure.
i've seen too much infrastructure build out in these
post-telecom-crash years (esp. landing points and backbone/gigapop)
that just seems suspect.  perhaps this also falls under the various
"critical infrastructure protection" programs juiced with cash post
9/11 with passive taps as added bonus.

not really, see below.
hardware monies buy things like FPGA driven filters, and these
hardware sniffers can in turn easily talk to banks of DDR.
there was a paper at USENIX or somewhere that showed Xilinx FPGA's
programmed with up to 700+ snort filter rules that could monitor a
10GigE stream in real time (yes, 10GigE) and scaled linear; just the
kind of mechanism well funded adversaries like to brute force. [i
can't find this paper anymore, does someone else have a link / copy?]
nallatech makes some nice FPGA hardware systems that would apply:
sure, this doesn't capture everything, but i suspect these filters are
tuned more for what they want to discard (p2p movie and warez traffic,
that'd eliminate quite a chunk, right?) than for what they want to
inspect.  (that is, what they want to inspect is everything they don't
consider useless and filter out)
on a side note, the recent interference in the Sourcefire and Check
Point merger makes you wonder, doesn't it?  what kind of
classification systems is the government using from Sourcefire that is
so sensitive it must be US owned?
they don't get to play on the equipment.  they only get to splice a fiber to it.
you can buy these kinds of high capacity hardware filtering /
classifying systems but they are insanely expensive.  like
 for example.

this would be a fun exercise.  i wonder how much dark fiber is truly
"dark" these days...
a friend and i had a discussion on this very subject recently.  if you
don't mind the social network analysis but desire privacy of content,
does it matter if your encrypted comms stand out assuming they can't
break the cipher?
strong anonymity against an NSA threat model is very difficult;
sometimes privacy of content is sufficient.
in any case, i'd like to see encryption become the norm for even
trivial communications. like the Azureus enhancements Steve mentioned
this can be done in a simple and intuitive manner - it will just take

NSA is often a villain due to the shear breadth of data they monitor. But corporate privacy invaders can get a level of detail on your

privacy enhancing technologies would work well.  perhaps covering:
- anonymous email (mixnets) and browsing/sessions (tor/onions)
- pseudonymous communication with aliases. (Off-the-Record?  blogs?)
- security and least privilege?

this is an excellent idea.  i've played with the old WRT54G's a little
bit and it is certainly an amenable piece of equipment for this kind
of tweaking.  i've had problems trying to get too much on a single
unit as the flash space restrictions are tight but there is still
enough space to support a decent set of services (like openvpn and tor
as you mention).
this is the only other trouble i've had with them: the crypto bits
tend to get sluggish, esp. when negotiating EDH or generating keys.
(fortunately this isn't needed all too frequently)
i haven't looked at the GS but if they support WPA2 they should also
support AES; it would be nice if this AES engine could be used for
general offload in addition to WPA2 traffic :)

@_subject: [Clips] Say Hello to Voiceprinting 
we used a system like this for a retail directory assistance service
called Infone.  the caller could authenticate by pin, by voice, or
both.  the voice enrollment required the caller to say "hello, infone"
three times or until a suitable voice print could be attained.
then when the caller accessed the system they would simply say "hello,
infone" and based on their incoming phone number the print was either
accepted or rejected.
the problem with these systems is that they can only select / identify
an individual from a small group of possibilities and line quality /
head colds can cause false negatives.
for example, if more than 10 people were associated with an account
the user had to enter a PIN to identify them, and then provide the
"hello, infone" voice print for further authentication.
it is also a non-trivial matter to tune the threshold for
success/failure appropriately for a given set of users.  this is all
based on probabilities so you need to set the threshold high enough
that the risk of false positives (impostors) is low enough to keep
security/losses at acceptable limits while also preventing excessive
numbers of false negatives that will annoy and aggravate your
still, the tech keeps getting (incrementally) better and it does
provide an additional layer of defence.  i'm not sure the currently
excessive costs associated with this technology are worth the benefit
though. (there are basically two companies who specialize in this
stuff (they've bought up all the rest) and they charge a premium for
these services and technologies :)

a nice overview: Aharonov, et al. [3] showed that a slightly more general formulation
of adiabatic algorithms, when used for quantum-state generation, is in
fact universal for QC. Designing quantum algorithms via quantum-state
generation is a novel and potentially important direction, because it
ties into classical algorithm design techniques using Markov chains
and techniques such as bounds on conductance and spectral gaps. As a
first step, it would be interesting to even give such an algorithm for
solved problems such as quadratic residuosity or discrete logarithms.

see there are effective ways to manage this risk.  i'm not keen on posting
details here but perhaps off the record or at a later date.  you do
need to be willing to drop a suspect host, so mitigation is mainly
centered on secure initialization and subsequent vigilant monitoring
to decide when to cut out.  there are probably a thousand more
significant risks from host and application security angles, but
physical security is indeed tricky/severely limited in a remote
dedicate server scenario.
heheh, curious yellow raises its head again...  this has always been a
favorite for censorship resistance and plausible deniability.
it works ok; the processor struggles with the crypto (read: latency
and constant max load) but otherwise tolerable.  i've thought about
making a "Tor spot" configuration for access points, where transparent
http/tcp and dns proxy through Tor is provided for all associated
clients.  how useful would such a thing be?  (perhaps
personaltelco-free / personaltelco-anon dual service?)
the trade-off's and design constraints are more complicated and
context dependant.  read the draft blocking resistant Tor design
paper, it covers all these topics and provides a mostly reasonable
approach (the devil is in the details, as always...)

not too hard, actually.  softswitching makes this kind of hi jinx
relatively easy, and the Cirpack switching system Vodafone uses is
commonly available (to those steeped in EU telco at least).
[see  ]
i test systems like this from excel/lucent that use a unix host
controller communicating with one or more switch chassis full of
blades for spans of T1/E1, SS7, etc.  they send well defined packets
over ethernet to configure switch spans and perform call handling. it's an ugly binary protocol, like most are, but easily manipulated.
if you knew what you were doing it would be straightforward to insert
a promiscuous device on the LAN or add a process on the unix host used
by the softswitch that listened for incoming calls from a given set of
MIN's and one way conference these calls to a third party*.  if you
had access to a current version of the softswitch software itself for
modification it would be even easier (most companies license sources
and tailor or customize the software to run these switches so it's not
quite as simple as a generic drop in replacement).
it took "a professional" to do this, sure, but the number of people
skilled enough to pull this off is not a small number.
* the pre paid phones were probably vodafone as well, so that transit
for the conference'd calls was all on the same network and would thus
avoid using circuits from other carriers which would need to be
accounted for. (that is to say, it would be much easier to hide these
conferences as long as they stayed in network, rather than tying up
spans to external carriers which would probably trigger accounting

this description is a bit misleading or applies to a particular

softswitching systems in house.  presumably these would be more

TIA Lives On
By Shane Harris, National Journal
(c) National Journal Group Inc.
Thursday, Feb. 23, 2006
A controversial counter-terrorism program, which lawmakers halted more
than two years ago amid outcries from privacy advocates, was stopped
in name only and has quietly continued within the intelligence agency
now fending off charges that it has violated the privacy of U.S.
""It is no secret that some parts of TIA lived on behind the veil of
the classified intelligence budget.""
Research under the Defense Department's Total Information Awareness
program -- which developed technologies to predict terrorist attacks
by mining government databases and the personal records of people in
the United States -- was moved from the Pentagon's
research-and-development agency to another group, which builds
technologies primarily for the National Security Agency, according to
documents obtained by National Journal and to intelligence sources
familiar with the move. The names of key projects were changed,
apparently to conceal their identities, but their funding remained
intact, often under the same contracts.
It is no secret that some parts of TIA lived on behind the veil of the
classified intelligence budget. However, the projects that moved,
their new code names, and the agencies that took them over haven't
previously been disclosed. Sources aware of the transfers declined to
speak on the record for this story because, they said, the identities
of the specific programs are classified.
Two of the most important components of the TIA program were moved to
the Advanced Research and Development Activity, housed at NSA
headquarters in Fort Meade, Md., documents and sources confirm. One
piece was the Information Awareness Prototype System, the core
architecture that tied together numerous information extraction,
analysis, and dissemination tools developed under TIA. The prototype
system included privacy-protection technologies that may have been
discontinued or scaled back following the move to ARDA.
A $19 million contract to build the prototype system was awarded in
late 2002 to Hicks & Associates, a consulting firm in Arlington, Va.,
that is run by former Defense and military officials. Congress's
decision to pull TIA's funding in late 2003 "caused a significant
amount of uncertainty for all of us about the future of our work,"
Hicks executive Brian Sharkey wrote in an e-mail to subcontractors at
the time. "Fortunately," Sharkey continued, "a new sponsor has come
forward that will enable us to continue much of our previous work."
Sources confirm that this new sponsor was ARDA. Along with the new
sponsor came a new name. "We will be describing this new effort as
'Basketball,' " Sharkey wrote, apparently giving no explanation of the
name's significance. Another e-mail from a Hicks employee, Marc
Swedenburg, reminded the company's staff that "TIA has been terminated
and should be referenced in that fashion."
Sharkey played a key role in TIA's birth, when he and a close friend,
retired Navy Vice Adm. John Poindexter, President Reagan's national
security adviser, brought the idea to Defense officials shortly after
the 9/11 attacks. The men had teamed earlier on
intelligence-technology programs for the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, which agreed to host TIA and hired Poindexter to run
it in 2002. In August 2003, Poindexter was forced to resign as TIA
chief amid howls that his central role in the Iran-Contra scandal of
the mid-1980s made him unfit to run a sensitive intelligence program.
It's unclear whether work on Basketball continues. Sharkey didn't
respond to an interview request, and Poindexter said he had no comment
about former TIA programs. But a publicly available Defense Department
document, detailing various "cooperative agreements and other
transactions" conducted in fiscal 2004, shows that Basketball was
fully funded at least until the end of that year (September 2004). The
document shows that the system was being tested at a research center
jointly run by ARDA and SAIC Corp., a major defense and intelligence
contractor that is the sole owner of Hicks & Associates. The document
describes Basketball as a "closed-loop, end-to-end prototype system
for early warning and decision-making," exactly the same language used
in contract documents for the TIA prototype system when it was awarded
to Hicks in 2002. An SAIC spokesman declined to comment for this
Another key TIA project that moved to ARDA was Genoa II, which focused
on building information technologies to help analysts and policy
makers anticipate and pre-empt terrorist attacks. Genoa II was renamed
Topsail when it moved to ARDA, intelligence sources confirmed. (The
name continues the program's nautical nomenclature; "genoa" is a
synonym for the headsail of a ship.)
As recently as October 2005, SAIC was awarded a $3.7 million contract
under Topsail. According to a government-issued press release
announcing the award, "The objective of Topsail is to develop
decision-support aids for teams of intelligence analysts and policy
personnel to assist in anticipating and pre-empting terrorist threats
to U.S. interests." That language repeats almost verbatim the
boilerplate descriptions of Genoa II contained in contract documents,
Pentagon budget sheets, and speeches by the Genoa II program's former
As early as February 2003, the Pentagon planned to use Genoa II
technologies at the Army's Information Awareness Center at Fort
Belvoir, Va., according to an unclassified Defense budget document.
The awareness center was an early tester of various TIA tools,
according to former employees. A 2003 Pentagon report to Congress
shows that the Army center was part of an expansive network of
intelligence agencies, including the NSA, that experimented with the
tools. The center was also home to the Army's Able Danger program,
which has come under scrutiny after some of its members said they used
data-analysis tools to discover the name and photograph of 9/11
ringleader Mohamed Atta more than a year before the attacks.
Devices developed under Genoa II's predecessor -- which Sharkey also
managed when he worked for the Defense Department -- were used during
the invasion of Afghanistan and as part of "the continuing war on
terrorism," according to an unclassified Defense budget document.
Today, however, the future of Topsail is in question. A spokesman for
the Air Force Research Laboratory in Rome, N.Y., which administers the
program's contracts, said it's "in the process of being canceled due
to lack of funds."
It is unclear when funding for Topsail was terminated. But earlier
this month, at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, one of TIA's
strongest critics questioned whether intelligence officials knew that
some of its programs had been moved to other agencies. Sen. Ron Wyden,
D-Ore., asked Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte and
FBI Director Robert Mueller whether it was "correct that when [TIA]
was closed, that several ... projects were moved to various
intelligence agencies.... I and others on this panel led the effort to
close [TIA]; we want to know if Mr. Poindexter's programs are going on
somewhere else."
Negroponte and Mueller said they didn't know. But Negroponte's deputy,
Gen. Michael V. Hayden, who until recently was director of the NSA,
said, "I'd like to answer in closed session." Asked for comment,
Wyden's spokeswoman referred to his hearing statements.
The NSA is now at the center of a political firestorm over President
Bush's program to eavesdrop on the phone calls and e-mails of people
in the United States who the agency believes are connected to
terrorists abroad. While the documents on the TIA programs don't show
that their tools are used in the domestic eavesdropping, and
knowledgeable sources wouldn't discuss the matter, the TIA programs
were designed specifically to develop the kind of "early-warning
system" that the president said the NSA is running.
Documents detailing TIA, Genoa II, Basketball, and Topsail use the
phrase "early-warning system" repeatedly to describe the programs'
ultimate aims. In speeches, Poindexter has described TIA as an
early-warning and decision-making system. He conceived of TIA in part
because of frustration over the lack of such tools when he was
national security chief for Reagan.
Tom Armour, the Genoa II program manager, declined to comment for this
story. But in a previous interview, he said that ARDA -- which
absorbed the TIA programs -- has pursued technologies that would be
useful for analyzing large amounts of phone and e-mail traffic.
"That's, in fact, what the interest is," Armour said. When TIA was
still funded, its program managers and researchers had "good
coordination" with their counterparts at ARDA and discussed their
projects on a regular basis, Armour said. The former No. 2 official in
Poindexter's office, Robert Popp, averred that the NSA didn't use TIA
tools in domestic eavesdropping as part of his research. But asked
whether the agency could have used the tools apart from TIA, Popp
replied, "I can't speak to that." Asked to comment on TIA projects
that moved to ARDA, Don Weber, an NSA spokesman said, "As I'm sure you
understand, we can neither confirm nor deny actual or alleged projects
or operational capabilities; therefore, we have no information to
ARDA now is undergoing some changes of its own. The outfit is being
taken out of the NSA, placed under the control of Negroponte's office,
and given a new name. It will be called the "Disruptive Technology
Office," a reference to a term of art describing any new invention
that suddenly, and often dramatically, replaces established
procedures. Officials with the intelligence director's office did not
respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.

Taking Spying to Higher Level, Agencies Look for More Ways to Mine Data
He was alluding to databases maintained at an AT&T data center in Kansas,
which now contain electronic records of 1.92 trillion telephone calls, going
back decades. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital-rights advocacy
group, has asserted in a lawsuit that the AT&T Daytona system, a giant
storehouse of calling records and Internet message routing information, was
the foundation of the N.S.A.'s effort to mine telephone records without a
An AT&T spokeswoman said the company would not comment on the claim, or
generally on matters of national security or customer privacy.
But the mining of the databases in other law enforcement investigations is
well established, with documented results. One application of the database
technology, called Security Call Analysis and Monitoring Platform, or Scamp,
offers access to about nine weeks of calling information. It currently
handles about 70,000 queries a month from fraud and law enforcement
investigators, according to AT&T documents.
A former AT&T official who had detailed knowledge of the call-record
database said the Daytona system takes great care to make certain that
anyone using the database - whether AT&T employee or law enforcement
official with a subpoena - sees only information he or she is authorized to
see, and that an audit trail keeps track of all users. Such information is
frequently used to build models of suspects' social networks.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was discussing
sensitive corporate matters, said every telephone call generated a record:
number called, time of call, duration of call, billing category and other
details. While the database does not contain such billing data as names,
addresses and credit card numbers, those records are in a linked database
that can be tapped by authorized users.
New calls are entered into the database immediately after they end, the
official said, adding, "I would characterize it as near real time."
According to a current AT&T employee, whose identity is being withheld to
avoid jeopardizing his job, the mining of the AT&T databases had a notable
success in helping investigators find the perpetrators of what was known as
the Moldovan porn scam.
In 1997 a shadowy group in Moldova, a former Soviet republic, was tricking
Internet users by enticing them to a pornography Web site that would
download a piece of software that disconnected the computer user from his
local telephone line and redialed a costly 900 number in Moldova.
While another long-distance carrier simply cut off the entire nation of
Moldova from its network, AT&T and the Moldovan authorities were able to
mine the database to track the culprits.

... and people wonder why i don't have a cell phone (this is one of
many reason, although the largest being annoyance rather than privacy
for me):
 Mobile tracking devices on trial
Click presenter
Your mobile phone is a beacon - a radio transmitter in a box.
Therefore it is possible to trace the signal and work out where it is.
There are now several web companies which will track your friends' and
family's phones for you, so you always know where they are.
But just how safe is it to make location details available online?
There are several reasons why you may want to track someone. You may
be a company wanting to keep tabs on employees during work hours, or a
parent wanting to check up on a child's whereabouts.
These sorts of tracking services, now available in the UK, get
information from the network about which cell your phone is currently
in, and, for a small fee, display the location on an online map.
As well as checking where a certain phone is right now, you can run
scheduled lookups, or snail trails, to record the phone's movements
throughout the day, and produce a report for you to peruse at your
Obviously you cannot just enter any mobile phone number and expect to
track someone.
First of all you need to prove your identity, via a credit card, and
then, crucially, the owner of the phone in question needs to consent
to being tracked.
The owner is sent a text message telling them about the tracking
request, to which they must reply.
The question is: is it possible to circumvent this security, and track
someone without their knowledge?
I attempted to find out, using regular contributor Guy Kewney, an
independent technology journalist and, for one day only, human guinea
I sent him on a tour of London. He could go anywhere he wanted, and I
planned to meet up with him later and tell him, hopefully, where he
had been.
Guy did not know that when I borrowed his phone for a few minutes
earlier in the day, I took the opportunity to register it on one of
the tracking services.
I received the incoming text message warning him about the tracking,
responded to it and then deleted it from his inbox.
When I gave him his phone back, Guy had no idea he was now in
possession of a consenting tracking device.
Hence, a little while later, I could watch him emerge from the tube at
the start of his tour.
But just borrowing someone's phone for a few minutes is too obvious a
loophole. It is one which has already been closed by an industry body
which oversees new technologies such as mobile tracking services.
Voluntary rules
The Mobile Broadband Group has drawn up a voluntary code of conduct
which the networks in the UK ask location providers to stick to.
One of the conditions of the code is that after a phone is registered
as a tracking device, reminder texts should be sent to the phone at
random intervals.
This way, it should be impossible for a malicious tracker to intercept
every reminder.
The problem is, those random reminders are not required to be sent
very frequently.
We tracked several phones over several days, and often had to wait for
a day or two before receiving a reminder message.
Hamish Macleod from the Mobile Broadband Group, who came up with the
code of conduct, argues this is enough.
He said: "We assessed this risk during the development of the code and
consulted obviously with all the experts that we did, and the schedule
of random alerts that we came up with we thought was adequate to
protect against the risks.
"This is a situation to be kept under review as the service is developed."
With more and more children owning mobile phones, special attention
needs to be given to who can track them.
If you are not a genuine parent or guardian, the code requires
location services to check that both the tracker and the person being
tracked can prove they are consenting adults.
Mr Macleod says: "The person that is to be located has to demonstrate
to the service provider they are at least 16 years old.
"They can do this through various channels, for example they can get a
credit card number which is used as a proxy for age verification, or
something like that."
At least, that is what is supposed to happen. But neither of the
services we tested asked the person being tracked to prove they were
an adult.
Although they did ask us for the age of the person we wanted to track,
they did not check we were telling the truth.
The companies were not following the letter of the code and, what is
more, no-one was holding them to account.
HAVE YOUR SAY
What do you make of the new mobile tracking services online? Is it
ever possible for regulation to keep up with technology?
Neither service would comment on this oversight.
Although the code of conduct was well intentioned, the Mobile
Broadband Group admits it will need refining as loopholes become
It also highlights the limits of such voluntary codes, and the
problems with policing them.
Jago Russell from the human rights group Liberty says: "We have
concerns in general about industry codes of practice. They aren't
legal regulation; they don't give the consumer an effective legal
remedy if the code of practice isn't complied with.
"So in many ways they're not really worth the paper they're written on."
As a result of our investigation, The Mobile Broadband Group is making
some changes to the code of conduct.
The frequency of the random reminders is going to be increased, and
the code will make clearer the appropriate way to check the age of the
Guy Kewney says: "It's a shame but then if you start regulating new
technology you usually fall down because people don't expect the
"The real problem is that you can't actually perceive the unintended
consequences of your technology change, so a hard and fast rule that
says 'don't do this' won't stop you doing that, in which case you've
wasted your time passing it."
Should we really be worried about being tracked by mobile phones?
Guy Kewney says: "You can worry about anything in this society. If I
wanted to track you, the easy way to do it is - well you've found one
way, but if they've closed that loophole or if it becomes tricky -
then I just hire a private detective.
---end cut---
does anyone have a list / site for good research on anonymous wireless
communications?  there seem to be few papers or projects dealing with
this particular transport method.
"We introduce anonymous wireless rings: a new computational model for
ring networks. In the well-known hardware ring each processor has two
buffers, one corresponding to each of its neighbors. In the wireless
ring each processor has a single buffer and cannot distinguish which
neighbor the arriving bit comes from. This feature substantially
increases anonymity of the ring. A priori it is not clear whether any
non-trivial computation can be performed on wireless rings. "

i'd have to agree, with regards to corporate or government entities
making strong individual privacy a priority _on their own accord_ with
this kind of applied information technology.[1]
so the only feasible solution is empowering users to take
responsibility for their own information security and privacy.  if
"johnny can't encrypt"[2] this is a very tall order indeed[3].
what would the ideal minimum amount of information exposed consist of
if you could apply usable security/encryption and privacy enhancing
technologies to the usual communications today (voice, text, video,
- no content of payloads, due to end to end encryption
- strong anonymous mix networks for non interactive messaging
- weakly anonymous low latency onion/relay networks for near real time messaging
- seamless wireless and sneaker net support to offload locally/out of
band whenever possible
you'd still be exposing:
- location of endpoints used (except in the strong and latent mix
scenario perhaps)
- distinct parties involved (social network analysis)
- volume of encrypted traffic exchanged
i suppose the real question is how long would it take to design and
implement (and the hardware to support it prevalent for all users).
5 years seems extremely optimistic given the difficulties involved.
[and i suppose this also means the paranoid will all become proficient

i'd be interested to know what you find out.
totally unrelated commentary:
i dreamed recently i was an old man with a failing liver
(E_TOO_MUCH_DEFCON)  performing one last bemused retrospective on life
before my session expired.  i chuckled over the use of public key
encryption in a world with common large qubit quantum computers: the
relative key strengths now in use were measured in killowatts of
computation sustained over a minimum time period for key pair
generation on dedicated hardware with open ended storage (meaning
whatever you could generate within a lifetime of key pair computation
could be stored reasonably on a common storage medium)
i recall a very strong key pair started at 64 kilowatts over 100 days
but was at least conjectured to require a coherent state (raw qubit
brute force) larger than anything possible to build in our solar
nonces, digests, symmetric secrets and one time pads for key exchange
were all still measured in bytes though... *grin*
something else of potential relevance:
Hi Bill --
I know there has been some discussion on whether _strong_ primes are
needed for _RSA_.  The definition of a strong prime is a little more
involved; c.f. the paper by Rivest and Silverman
[  and also available on Ron Rivest's
web page].  I was unaware, though, that there is a debate regarding the
use of safe primes for Diffie-Hellman.  My impression is that the use of
safe primes is generally accepted to be an important practice that
thwarts various attempts to compute a discrete log (e.g.
Pohlig-Hellman); also enough safe primes and generators are published --
one may utilize them in a protocol (assuming the people who published
the list are trusted not to have deliberately chosen prime groups for
which computing a discrete log is easier :)).
I'm also not sure how the choice of primes for Diffie-Hellman relates to
the complexity of factoring as you mentioned in your post.  As far as I
know, no one (in the open community at least) has discovered a
meaningful reduction in a standard model between the Diffie-Hellman
problem over a prime group and Factoring (nor has anyone proven that
such reductions cannot exist).  The closest thing I can think of is
trying to come up with the factorization of p-1 as you might want to do
in the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm -- but in that case, the complexity
would be prohibitive if p-1 had any large prime factors...
Are you referring to performing Diffie-Hellman over some other group?
Or is there a connection that you know of and can elaborate on?

A Fabric of Illegality
[from the March 13, 2006 issue]
Now we know the truth: For months in 2002, when George W. Bush and his
top lieutenants were publicly insisting on their adherence to the
Geneva Conventions, they were privately torpedoing efforts by Alberto
Mora, the Navy's courageous general counsel, to prevent, and establish
accountability for, brutal treatment of detainees. Two years before
the publication of the Abu Ghraib photos, Mora confronted the
highest-level Pentagon officials over abuse of prisoners at Guantanamo
and warned the Administration that its interrogation policies invited
torture and cruelty. The New Yorker's Jane Mayer revealed Mora's
lonely campaign just as Kofi Annan and a team of United Nations
investigators declared Guantanamo a torture camp that should be closed
and its prisoners either tried or released.
If the Administration has so far been able to resist demands for
accountability, whether from the Pentagon's own lawyers or the UN, it
is because of the collusion of the courts and Congress in abuses both
international and within the United States. Exhibit A: the grotesque
February 16 ruling by US District Judge David Trager denying his
court's jurisdiction over the rendition to Syria and torture of
Canadian national Maher Arar, who spent nearly a year in secret
captivity (see David Cole on page 5). Exhibit B: the bipartisan effort
to avoid Congressional investigation of the NSA's warrantless
surveillance of American citizens.
Although key leaders remain angry at the White House for not seeking
Congressional approval for the NSA wiretap program, debate over
surveillance has been sidelined. Leaders from both parties are lining
up behind proposals to bleach the stain of illegality from warrantless
wiretaps--either by incorporating warrantless eavesdropping into the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or by simply declaring
warrantless taps legal. Lost is the simple fact that both plans
broaden domestic spying far beyond the Patriot Act and make hash of
the venerable constitutional demand for search warrants.
That Guantanamo and NSA spying on citizens--the Administration's
abuses abroad and at home--are part of the same fabric of illegality
was brought home by a February 14 House national security subcommittee
hearing. Led by Christopher Shays and Henry Waxman, the subcommittee
heard firsthand evidence of what becomes of truth-tellers in the Bush
military and intelligence services.
In this sense Mora was lucky: He was merely blocked at every turn. He
wasn't demoted like Specialist Samuel Provance, who was kicked
downstairs after confronting a general with horrifying details about
interrogations at Abu Ghraib. Mora wasn't declared by his bosses to be
mentally ill, like NSA whistleblower Russell Tice--who indicated to
the subcommittee that the agency's illegal "black ops" extend well
beyond the wiretap program. No one spread false rumors about Mora's
sex life, as the Defense Intelligence Agency did about Lieut. Col.
Anthony Shaffer after he revealed the extent of the government's
pre-9/11 knowledge about Mohamed Atta (gained through the "Able
Danger" data-mining program).
The dark arts of trashing whistleblowers, who are supposedly protected
by federal law, add yet another layer of illegality to the "war on
terror." Still, Congress and the courts dodge their responsibilities
while the White House maintains its right to stand above the law--and
torture, imprisonment without trial and warrantless spying on
Americans go on, and on.

The description on a page was not updated properly. Recent clients
use per-direction keys after they complete P2P KE.
Crypto suite is essentially just a protocol number. It requires
no authentication. If the server side responds with HELO.OK, it
means that it can comprehend specified protocol revision. Similar
to what happens during the SSH handshake.
It is not.
A protection against what kind of attack ?
Identity is used to specify which public key the client wants
to be authenticated with on the server side. Assuming it is
swapped in transition by a man in the middle, it would still
require an attacker to re-sign authentication hash in the
Assuming he has a private key to do that, he will effectively
succeed in authenticating under substituted ID. He then will
need to re-sign server's auth hash to complete the attack,
which is not going to happen.
There is an off chance that the attacker might swapped the
identity to one that has the same public key. The chances
of this happening are infinitely small unless an attacker
also has an access to victim's keypair, which becomes a
trivial attack case.
If you are referring to HMAC-SHA1 for authentication hashes, it
is a part of a crypto suite (protocol revision) spec.
This is the second revision of Hamachi system. First revision
was using SSL for cli-srv and IKE/ESP for p2p security. It was
a prototype and it soon become obvious that both SSL and IKE
were overkills for our purposes. We did not need certificate
authentication of SSL, we did not want to run our own auth
protocol over SSL/AnonDH, which would've increased the number
of packets per login sequence. We didn't need the flexibility
(ie complexity) of IKE either.
After stripping down IKE (ie removing SA negotiation, reworking
ID payloads and not doing quick mode), we essentially ended up
with a protocol that was also fit for securing cli-srv session.
It was further tweaked and replaced SSL.
I should probably add that I implemented IKE (v1) keying daemon
from scratch with all bells and wistles (NATT, extended MODP
groups, etc) at some point in the past. Some remnants of it
are still floating around, the library name was libike.
Yes, it is. This is why I like it.

In SSL, the lack of authentication of the cryptosuite could be used to
convince a v3 client that it is communicating with a v2 server, and
the v3 server that it is communicating with a v2 client, causing them
to communicate using SSL v2, which is called the "version rollback
attack".  This is not relevant to the hamachi protocol because there
is no negotiation.  Nevertheless, authenticating the previous
plaintext fields once a secure channel is established is considered
good form.
In Schneier's "Practical Cryptography", he suggests computing the MAC
over the entire history of sent messages, which ensures that any
tampering is detected at the next MAC.  This is eventually what was
done in SSLv3, for reasons Tero alluded to and which are successfully
thwarted for the reasons you describe.
I sort of wonder at the utility of a TCP implementation of the p2p
VPN... tunnelling TCP over TCP is well known to be a Bad Thing with
regard to interaction of the TCP timeouts.
Aside:  Can anyone tell me why the constants used in ipad and opad for
HMAC were chosen?  If they're not arbitrary, I'd like to know the
rationale behind them.

Nonces and DH exponents are serialized using PER-style ASN.1 encoding.
So the whole concatenation is unambigious.
Just to be clear, Hamachi tunnels VPN/P2P traffic over UDP. TCP is
used for client-server session only.
VPN over TCP is bad for two reasons. One you listed, and another
is that it becomes trivial to DoS this kind of VPN. TCP packets
are not authenticated (unless MD5/BGP extension is used, which
is unlikely), so the state of VPN transport layer and consequently
the state of a tunnel can be altered by 3rd party.
That's why SSL VPNs make very little sense in non-proxied setups
and that's why (I'd guess) OpenVPN 'tweaked' SSL to run over UDP

, Capability Talk My main point is  below.  Please skip down to that if reading time
is limited.
  While I agree with the difficulties in preventing covert
communication, I don't more generally agree with "Don't forbid what
you can't prevent", at least in this instance.  If confinement is a
natural effect of tokenized permission transfers (e.g. via
capabilities) where capabilities to objects are bundled with the
permission to communicate to the server of whatever object the
capability grants access to, then it seems quite natural and
effective to include that permission to communicate along with the
permission to access the object.  It may well be that communication
is possible in any case (e.g. via a covert channel), but by bundling
it explicitly with a permission to access an object it makes other
communication outside that explicitly granted only possible by
extraordinary means such as covert channels - which are available in
any case.  In my opinion it's preferable to explicitly limit such
communication rather than simply give up in the face of covert
channels and open all communication.
I admit that I do find it amusing finding myself on this side of this
argument in that the network operating system that I designed and
implemented through much of the 1980s (NLTSS, e.g.:
) took the opposite position on this issue - arguing that the
'natural' condition of processes is to be able to freely communicate
on a general network and that only object access (not the
right/permission to communicate) should be limited by capability
transfers.  At some point I came to accept that I was wrong in taking
that approach, I think mostly as a result of dealing with so many
situations where limiting communication (e.g. with firewalls) can
indeed be useful, even accepting the potential presence of covert
channels.  I generally feel that covert channels are more of a
theoretical than a practical threat, except in cases of dealing with
quite sensitive information like classified information or sensitive
intellectual property or business information.
  I won't explicitly address the above means to prevent covert
channels except to say that given the history of analysis of covert
channels I'm somewhat skeptical of such efforts.
One thing I think it's important to keep clear is that the mechanisms
that have generally been discussed for covert channels require
cooperation on both ends of the channel.  No mechanisms that I'm
aware of have been demonstrated which 'force' communication from one
process into another unwilling recipient (e.g. to access an object
without explicit permission).
  My main reason for writing is to dispute this statement:
I hope in the above you are meaning that capabilities are useless too
 vs. being
useless in general.  Of course the primary use for capabilities is in
explicitly transferring permissions between processes (subjects,
active objects, domains, whatever you choose to call active computing
entities).  One such permission is the permission to communicate
which, in the strongest capability systems, always explicitly
accompanies any transferred capability.  That is, when a capability
is transmitted from one process to another the permissions of the
capability include the authority to communicate to whatever service
provides the explicit permissions granted by the capability.  For
example, a capability to a file includes permission to communicate to
the appropriate file server.  However, most permissions explicitly
transferred by capabilities are some form of object access beyond the
authority to communicate to the object server.
While it's true that in the face of covert channels the value of
transferring a permission to communicate via a capability (e.g. as
above the permission to communicate to a file server) may be somewhat
constrained (the process and the file server may be able to
communicate in any case via a covert channel), the primary value of
the capability in transferring permissions (in the example the
permission to access a file, which is not compromised by the presence
of covert channels) is still present.
Providing confinement in the face of covert channels is indeed a
difficult problem.  However, I think it's important not to suggest
that capability tokenized transfers of permissions have no value
simply because one permission, the permission to communicate, is
difficult to control (with or without capabilities).  Most
permissions are not so difficult to control and can be perfectly
adequately managed with capabilities.  I'm not alone in arguing that
tokenizing permissions via capabilities provides many advantages over
conveying permissions by other means such as access lists or ambient
authority mechanisms (e.g. users/groups and permission
bits/configurations for users/groups).  These values of capability
transfers are not rendered useless simply because covert channels
limit the ability of capabilities to also manage the permission to communicate.
You (Constantine Plotnikov) may be arguing that a capability
infrastructure can't prevent a process from communicating permissions
via covert channels (e.g. by proxy).  This is true just as one can't
prevent data from being communicated via covert channels.  However,
this is again only dealing with the potential confinement value in
capabilities as distinct from what I see as their primary value in
providing for transfer of permissions for object access.  Covert
channels can thwart efforts at confinement, but they cannot thwart
efforts to limit object access to those processes which have been
explicitly granted access - even if via a covert channel through a proxy means.

i'm going to dismiss it by saying the InfoCard system is still managed
by a huge proprietary code base mired in an ecosystem of
the rootkits of the future will simply be hooking into userspace to
steal data off the pages you use to communicate over InfoCard secured
sessions back to your bank. (see the Haxdoor rootkit as an example of
That aside, what is this InfoCard? Well, that's not spelt out in so
many words as yet:
In the client user interface, each of the user's digital identities
used within the metasystem is represented by a visual "Information
Card" (a.k.a. "InfoCard", the source of this technology's codename).
The user selects identities represented by InfoCards to authenticate
to participating services. The cards themselves represent references
to identity providers that are contacted to produce the needed claim
data for an identity when requested, rather than claims data stored on
the local machine. Only the claim values actually requested by the
relying party are released, rather than all claims that the identity
possesses (see Law 2).
... Now we come to the user-centric part of the InfoCard system:
2.7. Authenticating Users to Sites InfoCards have several key
advantages over username/password credentials:
    * Because no password is typed or sent, by definition, your
password can not be stolen or forgotten.
    * Because authentication is based on unique keys generated for
every InfoCard/site pair (unless using a card explicitly designed to
enable cross-site collaboration), the keys known by one site are
useless for authentication at another, even for the same InfoCard.
    * Because InfoCards will resupply claim values (for example, name,
address, and e-mail address) to relying parties that the user had
previously furnished them to, relying parties do not need to store
this data between sessions. Retaining less data means that sites have
fewer vulnerabilities. (See Law 2.)
What does that mean? Although it wasn't mentioned there, it turns out
that there are two possibilities: Client side key generation and
relationship tracking, as well as "provider generated InfoCards"
written up elsewhere:
    Under the company's plan, computer users would create some cards
for themselves, entering information for logging into Web sites. Other
cards would be distributed by identity providers -- such as banks or
governmental agencies or online services -- for secure online
authentication of a person's identity.
    To log in to a site, computer users would open the InfoCard
program directly, or using Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, and
then click on the card that matches the level of information required
by the site. The InfoCard program would then retrieve the necessary
credentials from the identity provider, in the form of a secure
digital token. The InfoCard program would then transmit the digital
token to the site to authenticate the person's identity.
Obviously the remote provision of InfoCards will depend on buy-in,
which is a difficult pill to follow as that means trusting Microsoft
in oh so many ways - something they haven't really got to grips with.
But then there are also client-generated tokens. Are they useful?
If they have client-side key generation and relationship caching, then
these are two of the missing links in building a sustainable secure
system. See my emphasis further above for a hint on relationship
tracking and see Kim Cameron's blogfor this comment: "Cameron: A
self-issued one you create yourself." Nyms (as per SSH and SOX) and
relationship tracking (again SSH, and these days Trustbar,Petname and
recent other suggestions) are strong. These ideas have been around for
a decade or more, we call it opportunistic cryptography as a school.
Alternatively, notice how the credentials term is slipped in there.
That's not how Stefan Brands envisages it (from Identity on the move I
- Stefan Brands on user-centric identity management), but they are
using his term. What that means is unclear (and see Identity on the
move III - some ramblings on "we'll get it right this time, honest
injun!" for more).
Finally, one last snippet:
3.6. Claims != "Trust" A design decision was to factor out trust
decisions and not bundle them into the identity metasystem protocols
and payloads. Unlike the X.509 PKIX [IETF 05], for example, the
metasystem design verifies the cryptography but leaves trust analysis
for a higher layer that runs on top of the identity metasystem.
Hallelujah! Trust is something users do. Crypto systems do claims
about relationships.

previous comment about quantum computers / fast GNFS / etc.  they are

this is particular to the method TD mentioned i think...
i am assuming the following:
- the operating system is installed on a loop-aes volume so that
integrity of the kernel, libraries and utilities is protected via
- the one time pads are stored encrypted in a similar manner so that
access to them requires external keys (like the gpg encrypted keys
used for loop-aes volumes)
- the passphrase used to authenticate a user for access to the pads is
coupled with external storage (usb) of the keys used to access the
to recover the plaintext communication from the encrypted datagrams
the attacker would need to obtain the encrypted pad, the keys on
external storage (usb), and the passphrase to access the keys.
this doesn't provide time destruction so i assume this is in reference
to Tyler's description.  you could couple the user authentication with
a physically hardened token of some sort for access to the pads but
even this would require manual destruction.

think the issue is that most of the security added has been

it seems like this should be possible using a radioactive material

a mask (beryllium?) with the key space on it.
assume a grid of cells on a flat surface containing the radioactive
material; if a given cell emits over a threshold of radiation it is a
'1' bit, dead it is a 0 bit.  exposing the 0's to a neutron emitter
would fission the radioactive cells early leaving it's ionizing
radiation level below the threshold.
there would be some delay between when the key was usable with all
cells/bits readable (a few days, weeks, months?) and when it was still
holding a detectable / useful amount of key information that could be
used in a brute force attack against the unknown bits of key.

Steven M. Bellovin Fri, 06 Jan 2006 14:02:12 -0800
18 USC 2702(c) says
        A provider described in subsection (a) may divulge a record or
        other information pertaining to a subscriber to or customer of
        such service (not including the contents of communications
        covered by subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2)) ...
        (6) to any person other than a governmental entity.
If the phone companies are not giving it out voluntarily, perhaps
they're being tricked or perhaps they have corrupt employees.
from the article:
""In some cases, telephone company insiders secretly sell customers'
phone-call lists to online brokers, despite strict telephone company
rules against such deals, according to Schumer.""
the call center employees and other data services API's (less common)
is exactly how they do it.  t-mobile, verizon, sprint, they all
contract out to call centers for various things which provide the call
center operators a restricted environment in which to use their
internal applications (usually IE, sometimes Remedy or Oracle Forms,
graphical Java apps, etc).
obviously part of the features of these applications is search by
name, MIN, account, etc.  often you can access a person's entire
account through such systems and very little if any oversight is
provided.  the carriers sole focus (as it seems) is to prevent
fraudulent equipment/phone deliveries to operators using customer
accounts.  they could care less about unauthorized access given their
lack of any attempt to halt such activity.
in addition to this, many of these internal networks are horribly
insecure, as was well demonstrated by the t-mobile hacks earlier this
year. [1]
the only reason they continue to get away with such poor practice is
that these networks are (in theory) all internal with dedicated lines
from the call center back to the carrier networks on which the
applications are run. and the fallout from their insecurity is not
directly attributable back to them (they can and do blame various
middle men, from devious operators to negligent call center policies,

"To test the service, the FBI paid Locatecell.com $160 to buy the

Researchers Develop Quantum Processor By Jay Wrolstad
January 12, 2006 11:57AM
A computer chip based on the esoteric science of quantum mechanics has
been created by researchers at the University of Michigan. The chip
might well pave the way for a new generation of supercomputers.
Employing the same semiconductor-fabrication techniques used to create
common computer chips, the Michigan team was able to trap a single
atom within an integrated chip and control it using electrical
Electrically charged atoms (ions) for such quantum computers are
stored in traps in order to isolate the qubits, a process that is
essential for the system to work.
The challenge is that current ion traps can hold only a few atoms, or
qubits, and are not easily scaled, making it difficult to create a
quantum chip that can store thousands or more atomic ions. A string of
such atoms, in theory, could store thousands of bits of information.
In the chip created at Michigan, which is the size of a postage stamp,
the ion is confined in a trap while electric fields are applied. Laser
light puts a spin on the ion's free electron, enabling it to flip it
between the one or zero quantum states.
The spin of the electron dictates the value of the qubit. For example,
an up-spin can represent a one, or a down-spin can represent a zero --
or the qubit can occupy both states simultaneously.
Applications for Cryptography
The quantum processor is made of gallium arsenide in a layered
structure and etched with electrodes using the same type of
lithography process as those used to create today's computer chips.
Each electrode is connected to a separate voltage supply, and these
various electrical voltages control the ion by moving as it hovers in
a space carved out of the chip.
The next step is to build a bigger chip with many more electrodes, so
that it can store more ions. There still is a lot of work to be done
to learn how to control lots of ions in one of these chips. It won't
be nearly as easy as it was with conventional computer chips, but at
least we know what to do in principle, Monroe said.
"This type of integrated chip structure is significant because it
demonstrates a way to scale the quantum computer to bigger systems,"
Monroe said. "It has applications for processing very large [data
sets] such as in cryptography, for example, and there is a lot of
interest in this by the government."

there are other easy ways to obtain outage information, especially
when the fiber affected handles significant amounts of traffic.  they
have stemmed the tide of outage information but more than enough gets
by to be useful for this type of analysis.  (although it was much
easier to just hit up the FCC for history when they kept track of it.
the telcos are just as glad to keep this data secret - they pushed as
hard as uncle sam to hide this data)
and as mentioned below, it doesn't take a backhoe either.  highly
capable portable power tools, post hole diggers, a myriad of other
construction equipment, could wreak havoc just as easily.  (Milwaukee
V28 portable saws are a good example - some disgruntled telco
employee(s?) in canada used a portable saw to cut two long distance
cables into the US causing over 280,000 circuits to go dead)
the tricky part is identifying redundant paths/rings as both must
usually be interrupted to create significant outage. (graph theory
applied to directed high degree node/link attacks)
there is a reason they are pursuing security through obscurity so
heavily.  sometimes it's all you've got... :)

  While it is always fun to call the government stupid, or anyone else for
that matter, there is a little more to the story.
  - For one you do not need a backhoe to cut fiber
  - Two, fiber carries a lot more than Internet traffic - cell phone, 911,
financial tranactions, etc. etc.
  - Three, while it is very unlikely terrorists would only attack telecom
infrastructure, a case can be made for a telecom attack that amplifies a
primary conventional attack.  The loss of communications would complicate
things quite a bit.
  I'll agree it is very far fethced you could hatch an attack plan from FCC
outage reports, but I would not call worrying about attacks on
telecommunications infrastructure stupid.  Enough sobriety though, please
return to the flaming.

the solution (at least, the only effective solution aside from
significant infrastructure redundancy - $$$) is rapid repair, and
att's disaster recovery program works well in this regard.  if you
recall after the trade center attacks (taking out massive CO capacity)
they used a fleet of mobile switching trailers to terminate and switch
all of the damaged fiber.
this type of disaster recovery is also expensive, but much less than
buried infrastructure and fixed COs.
in my experience severely congested packet networks are just as shitty
as outages in general; what good is that broadband line when your path
to the world is constrained at 14.4? :P
the real problem is the lack of diversity at the physical "X fibers
through same conduit / RoW" layer that forces a single point of
failure.  the telco idea of path diversity is one ring buried plant
and the other ring aerial plant along the same right of way... doesn't take much for a clustered outage in this environment to
disrupt packet/cell based networks as much as dedicated circuits.
in this respect the DHS paranoia over bridge photography begins to
make a little more sense (although still useless).

@_subject: [bear@sonic.net: Re: thoughts on one time pads] 
agreed; it would be interesting to debate the bare minimum
requirements for a system where pads would provide a useful
improvement in security.  this means all those other holes bidding
malicious peers welcome need to be closed.
note that unless you have a hardware entropy source generating
anything more than a small amount of truly random pad is going to take
a lonnnnng time.
the yarrow based /dev/random in bsd is a fucking cop out; they should
remove it (that is what /dev/urandom is for).
fortunately VIA, AMD and Intel all provide hw rng sources of varying
capability on commodity systems.
this is why i like pads for key distribution.  with key material pre
distributed between the endpoints that will consume it you can
restrict network communication so that only authenticated traffic
(from peers whom you have exchanged pads with) is allowed into higher
levels of the OS stack / forwarded / applications.
this is really where i see a justifiable security improvement - block
all unauthenticated traffic up front, no open ports, no complex public
key formats / negotiation. (it would also be interesting to see all of
the potential remote exploit vulnerabilities in common IPsec key
in this scenario you can still transfer your huge data archives around
without consuming the entire pad with a quickness; frequent IPsec key
exchange to refresh SA's leverage the security and simplicity of pads
while retaining the flexibility of a chained block cipher for bulk
strong authentication and endpoint security are one of these critical
components required to use a pad effectively.  at a minimum i've
settled on the following for managing key material and endpoint
- bootstrap with read-only disc media prepared by a trusted peer. boot takes about 8-12 seconds for key management mode on a 1Ghz VIA
- passphrase protected full disk encryption with loop-AES
- loop-AES key schedule on USB memory stick [two factor auth]
- distinct domains / runtime instances for specific purposes.  as an
example, key management mode (import / export of keys, generation of
pads, creation/modification of digital identity) does not even support
any network capabilities in the statically linked kernel.  all
interaction in this domain is performed via file system with keys
manually copied to external domains which are network aware or hosting
this does mean that you're stuck using linux/bsd* for a secure domain,
with grsec/lsm/selinux/pax style defenses highly suggested.  ideally a
capability operating system would be used, but this is a challenging
yes! fixed buffer sizes, small attack surface, authentication from the
first packet onward (rather than entering into a negotiation to
ascertain identity).
best regards,
* both of these kernels need a good audit before they can be trusted
(at least pertaining to the code exposed to unauthenticated attackers
at a minimum), as do_brk() and bsd beacon overflows in ring0

CRYSTAL CITY, Virginia -- The dingy hotel corridor was populated with

moved in close-knit groups, rounding a stranger or a rival group
conspicuously, the way cats do. They spoke in whispers. They glanced
nervously over their shoulders as they took calls on their cell
phones, then darted swiftly into alcoves.
They were government officials, telephone company honchos, military
officers, three-letter-agency spooks and cops, all brought together by
salesmen dealing in the modern equipment of surveillance. It was my
job to learn what they were up to.
They'd gathered for the ISS World Conference, a trade show featuring
the latest in mass communications intercept gear, held in the
Washington, D.C., suburb of Crystal City, Virginia. Situated
conveniently between Reagan National Airport and the Pentagon, Crystal
City is an artificial place dominated by conference centers and
hotels, set up to accommodate the endless, and often secret,
intercourse between the U.S. military and its myriad itinerant
contractors, lobbyists, consultants and trainers. They rotate in and
out, civilians using the airport, military personnel taking the subway
from the Pentagon, with Crystal City as the intersection in a
figure-eight circuit of constant activity.
Back in the narrow hotel corridor, vendors manned their booths,
exhibiting the latest gadgets for mass electronic surveillance:
machines capable of scouring the data streams of millions of
subscribers -- industrial-strength kits for packet interception and
analysis, RF interception, and voice and keyword recognition.

@_subject: user centric network endpoint based session 
trying to get some feedback for working documentation / design before
our next published iteration expected on july 4th.
please feel free to provide public comments or suggest related
projects/research/code to me directly or on list.
throwing down the gauntlet:
using various authentication and key management methods at the TCP
session level associated with a specific IP/port endpoint pair for
access to network services[1][2][3][4][5]* is a relic from decades
past and is not only inefficient and inflexible but actively
detrimental to good usable security due to the baggage and complexity
inherent in these methods.[6][7][8]
access to network services should be provided on top of a network
endpoint local to the two domains requesting and providing services
respectively, with user centric authentication for initialization of
the secure IPv4/IPv6 tunnel session to which services are bound and
revocation performed by terminating this session and the ability to
reestablish it.
revocable delegation is implemented by proxy of traffic between peers
to the delegated domain and irrevocable delegation implemented by
sharing authentication credentials for the desired endpoint service(s)
with the trusted peer for direct communication without proxy.
* i listed three distributed capability based protocols not as a
slight, but to point out that a capability / POLA / least privilege
approach to building and providing services at the OS and application
layers is the only way truly good security can be realized.  i would
like to see the implementation / protocol specific parts of
communication privacy pulled out of such projects so they can focus on
and implement what they are designed for and most effective at. this
is a long term vision as the effort to transition to wide scale
capability based security is significant.[9]
in a sense this is simply a way to exchange "the capability to
communicate with me privately" and then utilize the services made
available to your peers when this capability is exercised.
Q: why delegate authentication and privacy to a network IPv4/IPv6
endpoint layer?
- this allows a flexible and intuitive method for implementing privacy
and authentication of digital communication between peers.  the
existing tools and concepts associated with Virtual Private Networks
can be employed in a decentralized and user centric manner while
existing applications and services can use the strong authentication
and session management available by binding to the desired endpoint
"sharing the authentication and privacy bootstrap" makes sense for
everyone. more reasons?
- it allows you to limit any unauthenticated attacks against
application / private services to the VPN layer itself (OpenVPN port,
IPsec stack, etc), thus keeping applications more vulnerable to attack
(rich web services, new apps, etc) inside an authenticated boundary.
NOTE: this should not be interpreted as the usual "perimeter security"
model which is flawed.  when each peer communicates directly you have
effectively deperimeterized the hosts on the network.
- it meshes well with a virtual machine approach to isolating domains
where each VM instance can have it's own network endpoint tied to
distinct authenticated sessions.
- it allows pet names to be given to distinct addresses bound to peer
identity (using the SHA2-256 digest of peer public key to generate a
feed::/8 address for example, which can be given a petname[10] in
public.peertech.org or 172.16.27.53 devwiki)
- traffic shaping, bandwidth monitoring, IDS and other techniques can
be applied to distinct authenticated sessions using the desired IP
address in a straightforward manner.  this can be particularly
difficult to do when an application uses ephemeral / dynamic ports but
is simple with distinct endpoints.
Q: what about passwords?
- it is assumed that this style of security would utilize full disk
encryption or a key manager (like the browser site login remember
feature) to manage strong authentication material associated with a
user's identity.  passwords are too weak for good network
Q: what would the key distribution for this kind of identity
management look like?
- some examples:
A. Strongly authenticated propinquitous capability exchange:
  First two peers exchange public keys (self signed OpenVPN
certificates) and endpoint locators in person.
  Second they both connect over wireless / LAN directly using OpenVPN
to establish an authenticated and private network between them.
B. Strongly authenticated transitive introduction:
  Using a secure session pair created via strong auth, send the public
key of each peer to be introduced to each other.
  Each peer attempts directly connecting using the endpoint
identifiers for each other obtained from the mutually trusted peer.
C. Opportunistically authenticated capability exchange:
  Petition public / untrusted introducer with nickname or other
identifier for endpoint discovery (coderman.dyndns.org for example).
  Connect to peer and exchange and save keys (openssh style).
  Keys may be verified in the future or reset if problems are encountered.
Q: This sounds way too complicated; what can support this kind of connectivity:
- while difficult this is feasible and straightforward.  existing
tools like OpenVPN, OpenSSH 3.4+, IPsec, PPTP, and others can all be
integrated in a suitable fashion using everything from UDP, TCP to
ICMP and even covert DNS tunnels or 802.11 injection for transport.
the key will be making key management and user interaction simple
enough for the appropriate threat models.

"Fail-Safe Techniques Erase Magnetic Storage Media"
"This is a very challenging problem," said Michael Knotts, a research
scientist in the GTRI's Signature Technology Laboratory. "We had to
verify that the data would be beyond all possible recovery even with
unlimited budget and unlimited time. Commercial devices on the market
for data erasure just couldn't fill the bill, because they were
magnetically too weak, they were physically too large and heavy, or
they didn't meet stringent air safety standards."
Producing a magnetic field sufficient to destroy data patterns
required the use of neodymium iron-boron magnets custom-designed for
the project and special pole pieces made of esoteric cobalt alloys.
The magnets, which weigh as much as 125 pounds, had to produce fields
sufficient to penetrate metallic housings that surround some drives.
"We developed models for magnetic circuits that we could run through
optimization codes to design the best shape to get the field that we
needed," Knotts said. "It takes quite a magnetic field to get through
the steel enclosures on some of the drives. We are producing magnetic
fields comparable to those used in magnetic resonance imaging
equipment, so these are not your ordinary refrigerator magnets."
"This was certainly an unusual project," he said. "It's not often that
we get paid to crush equipment in presses, blow things up and set off
fires in microwave ovens."
i occasionally use one of those noisy AC powered degauss'ers on hard
disks but have wondered if it would pass the "unlimited budget and
unlimited time" test.  i wonder what it would take to restrain a disk
through an MRI machine without it impaling itself into the coils...
(some of those horror stories are pretty wild)
initializing a disk with entropy afterwards is also annoyingly time
consuming for big disks.  i'm concerned about just how usable you can

here's lots of news today about the (not particularly surprising)
revelations that AT&T may have helped monitor internet traffic for the
NSA. It's interesting to note, with this news, the side story that
AT&T also just revamped their privacy policy, allowing them to more
freely share whatever data they collect with government officials.
However, rather than discuss those two issues (which are being
discussed widely), a more interesting question is whether or not this,
along with the ongoing debates around net neutrality, will actually
lead more people to simply encrypt their internet traffic. It
certainly could open up quite the business opportunity for firms
providing encrypted VPN systems that basically scramble all your data
so your ISP can't snoop and can't prioritize (or downgrade) the
poor chumps who buy the proprietary snake oil; true security requires
visibility, and alas there's not a big market for decentralized open
source security/privacy infrastructure (a paying market that is).

Bank Data Sifted in Secret by U.S. to Block Terror
By ERIC LICHTBLAU and JAMES RISEN
WASHINGTON, June 22  Under a secret Bush administration program
initiated weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, counterterrorism officials
have gained access to financial records from a vast international
database and examined banking transactions involving thousands of
Americans and others in the United States, according to government and
industry officials.
The program is limited, government officials say, to tracing
transactions of people suspected of having ties to Al Qaeda by
reviewing records from the nerve center of the global banking
industry, a Belgian cooperative that routes about $6 trillion daily
between banks, brokerages, stock exchanges and other institutions. The
records mostly involve wire transfers and other methods of moving
money overseas and into and out of the United States. Most routine
financial transactions confined to this country are not in the
"The capability here is awesome or, depending on where you're sitting,
troubling," said one former senior counterterrorism official who
considers the program valuable. While tight controls are in place, the
official added, "the potential for abuse is enormous."
Officials described the Swift program as the biggest and most
far-reaching of several secret efforts to trace terrorist financing.
Much more limited agreements with other companies have provided access
to A.T.M. transactions, credit card purchases and Western Union wire
payments, the officials said.
Treasury officials said Swift was exempt from American laws
restricting government access to private financial records because the
cooperative was considered a messaging service, not a bank or
financial institution. [ED: heheh]
Several people familiar with the Swift program said they believed that
they were exploiting a "gray area" in the law and that a case could be
made for restricting the government's access to the records on Fourth
Amendment and statutory grounds.
In terrorism prosecutions, intelligence officials have been careful to
"sanitize," or hide the origins of evidence collected through the
program to keep it secret, officials said.
Quietly, counterterrorism officials sought to expand the information
they were getting from financial institutions. Treasury officials, for
instance, spoke with credit card companies about devising an alert if
someone tried to buy fertilizer and timing devices that could be used
for a bomb, but they were told the idea was not logistically possible,
a lawyer in the discussions said.
Intelligence officials were so eager to use the Swift data that they
discussed having the C.I.A. covertly gain access to the system,
several officials involved in the talks said. But Treasury officials
resisted, the officials said, and favored going to Swift directly.
[ED: wow, that would have been fun. crash an international banking
network by accident? oops!]
Within weeks of 9/11, Swift began turning over records that allowed
American analysts to look for evidence of terrorist financing.
Initially, there appear to have been few formal limits on the
"At first, they got everything  the entire Swift database," one
person close to the operation said.
Officials realized the potential for abuse, and narrowed the program's
targets and put in more safeguards. Among them were the auditing firm,
an electronic record of every search and a requirement that analysts
involved in the operation document the intelligence that justified
each data search. Mr. Levey said the program was used only to examine
records of individuals or entities, not for broader data searches.
Despite the controls, Swift executives became increasingly worried
about their secret involvement with the American government, the
officials said. By 2003, the cooperative's officials were discussing
pulling out because of their concerns about legal and financial risks
if the program were revealed, one government official said.
"How long can this go on?" a Swift executive asked, according to the official.
Even some American officials began to question the open-ended
arrangement. "I thought there was a limited shelf life and that this
was going to go away," the former senior official said.

- one telco coder who knows the API / state machine of the soft switch

level - harder to do, but can be more stealthy)
- one technician who can supply the current switch configuration

- telco test configuration (a softswitch configuration as close to
target configuration as possible, a tsunami or other bulk call
generator / call test harness)
- time and money.

interest, bridge to available one way conference, connect conference

But you don't have to reveal that you sent him email.  You can use
stealthy communication.
Stealthy communication is communication wherein not only is the
content concealed from eavesdroppers by encryption, but information
about who is communicating with whom, when, or if at all, is
concealed, as well.
The Internet can be used for stealthy communication.  The basic idea
is that each potential participant has ongoing traffic to and from a
message pool which is propagated world-wide.  When the participant has
no live traffic to send, dummy traffic is sent instead.  The dummy
traffic is indistinguishable from the live traffic except by using
decryption keys which are chosen by correspondents.  The outbound
traffic continues autonomously without interruption for months and
years and is not correlated to the live traffic, so an observer
without the keys cannot determine when or how much live communication
is happening.  Inbound cover traffic consists of taking a full feed of
the message pool at all times without interruption.
A Debian Linux package exists which enables stealthy email.  It has
been in everyday use for years, although not widely.  Details on
request.  I am looking for someone to host it.  Any volunteers?

'Torture Boy' Signals More Spying
By Robert Parry
March 2, 2006
Correcting misleading testimony to Congress, Attorney General Alberto
Gonzales has signaled that George W. Bush's warrantless surveillance
of Americans went beyond the known eavesdropping on communications to
suspected terrorists overseas.
In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Feb. 28, Gonzales
recanted testimony he gave on Feb. 6 when he declared that Bush had
only authorized a narrowly constructed warrantless wiretapping program
by the National Security Agency against Americans in touch with
foreign terror suspects.
Referring to a part of his testimony in which he said Bush had
approved the NSA program "and that is all that he has authorized,"
Gonzales withdrew that language, saying "I did not and could not
address  any other classified intelligence activities." [Washington
Post, March 1, 2006]
The strained wording of Gonzales's letter  and the fact that he
deemed it necessary to correct his testimony  suggest that other
warrantless surveillance programs exist outside the framework of the
NSA program, which began shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror
attacks and was exposed by the New York Times in December 2005.
Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the committee's Republican
chairman, didn't put Gonzales under oath at the Feb. 6 hearing, but
false statements to Congress still constitute a potential criminal
Close Questioning
The dubious testimony came during close questioning by Sen. Patrick
Leahy of Vermont, the committee's ranking Democrat. Leahy pressed
Gonzales on the administration's claim that Congress gave Bush the
power to wiretap without a court warrant when it authorized use of
force against al-Qaeda after the Sept. 11 attacks.
In his testimony, Gonzales argued that the congressional use-of-force
authorization, combined with the President's Commander-in-Chief power
in the Constitution, permitted Bush to approve a wiretapping program
for communications between Americans and terror suspects operating
outside the United States.
But  in challenging Bush's right to ignore the 1978 Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act, which requires a special court to
approve wiretaps  Leahy demanded to know if the administration's
legal interpretation also let Bush conduct other warrantless spying on
Americans, including tapping purely domestic phone calls, mail
openings and "black bag" break-ins into people's homes and offices.
"Under that (administration) logic, is there anything that stops you
from wiretapping without a warrant somebody inside the United States
that you suspect of having al-Qaeda connections?" Leahy asked.
"Clearly, Senator, that is not what's going on here," Gonzales
responded. "The President had authorized a much more narrow program.
We are always, of course, subject to the Fourth Amendment. So the
activities of any kind of surveillance within the United States would,
of course, be subject to the Fourth Amendment," which requires
"probable cause" and a court warrant before the property of Americans
can be searched.
Leahy persisted. "Under your interpretation of this, can you go in and
do mail searches? Can you go into e-mails? Can you open mail? Can you
do black-bag jobs?  Can you go and do that (to) Americans?"
Gonzales responded, "Sir, I've tried to outline for you and the
committee what the President has authorized, and that is all that he
has authorized."
"Did it authorize the opening of first-class mail of U.S. citizens?"
Leahy continued. "That you can answer, yes or no."
Gonzales: "There is all kinds of wild speculation about..."
Leahy: "Did it authorize it?"
Gonzales: "There is all kinds of wild speculation out there about what
the President has authorized and what we're actually doing. And I'm
not going to get into a discussion, Senator."
Recanted Testimony
Three weeks later, by recanting the statement about "that is all that
he (Bush) has authorized" in the context of Leahy's line of
questioning, Gonzales appears to be acknowledging that some of Leahy's
concerns are valid, that there are other components to Bush's
warrantless surveillance operations beyond the NSA program.
Given the fact that the Bush administration and its media allies have
openly challenged the loyalty of Americans who have disagreed with
Bush's policies, it would not be a big jump to suspect that Bush has
authorized spying on citizens, journalists and/or politicians who
have, in his view, undermined his strategy in the War on Terror or the
Iraq War.
Some Republicans publicly have urged Bush to counter these Americans
whom they call "Fifth Columnists" for supposedly sympathizing with or
otherwise helping the enemy.
At the Feb. 6 hearing, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., declared that "I
stand by this President's ability, inherent to being Commander in
Chief, to find out about Fifth Column movements, and I don't think you
need a warrant to do that."
When Graham offered to work with the administration to draft
guidelines for how best to neutralize this alleged threat, Gonzales
smilingly replied, "Senator, the President already said we'd be happy
to listen to your ideas." [See Consortiumnews.com's "Bush's Mysterious
'New Programs'."]
With Bush's elastic use of language and his aggressive interpretation
of his own powers, there would seem to be little that Bush feels he
cannot do.
Gonzales, who was Bush's White House counsel before becoming Attorney
General, is part of a cadre of far-right lawyers who have asserted
virtually unlimited powers for Bush during the indefinite War on
Gonzales earned the nickname "Torture Boy" for going along with
ideologues like John Yoo and David Addington in defending
interpretations of Bush's authority that opened the door to torture
and other abuses of U.S. detainees imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay, Iraq,
Afghanistan and secret CIA jails scattered around the world. [See
Consortiumnews.com's "U.S. Disconnect on Bush's Abuses."]
Legal Resistance
The right-wing lawyers encountered opposition from professional
attorneys at the Justice Department and the Defense Department. The
professionals  the likes of Assistant Attorney General Jack Goldsmith
and U.S. Navy general counsel Alberto Mora  forced the Bush lawyers
into some retreats on the most expansive assertions of executive
power, especially involving torture.
Referring to one of Yoo's opinions that asserted the President's power
to subject Guantanamo inmates to cruel, inhumane and degrading
treatment, Navy general counsel Mora wrote, "The memo espoused an
extreme and virtually unlimited theory of the extent of the
President's Commander-in-Chief authority." [See Mora's 22-page
chronology, as posted by The New Yorker.]
But, one by one, these internal critics were pushed out of the
government. Goldsmith resigned to take a teaching position at Harvard
Law School; Mora quit to take a job as general counsel for Wal-Mart's
international operations. [See Consortiumnews.com's "Another Bush Lie"
on Goldsmith, or The New Yorker's "The Memo" on Mora.]
In the context of Bush's top legal advisers rationalizing Bush's right
to torture prisoners or to jail American citizens without charges, the
likelihood seems high they also would claim for Bush the power to spy
on domestic opponents.
As Gonzales told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Feb. 6, "detention
is far more intrusive than electronic surveillance."
But it's unclear whether the American people will ever learn what
these additional eavesdropping programs were or whom they targeted.
The Bush administration has wrapped its domestic spying program in
layer after layer of secrecy and lies.
In a speech in Buffalo, N.Y., on April 20, 2004, Bush went out of his
way to mislead the American people into a false sense of security
about his respect for Fourth Amendment prohibitions on warrantless
"By the way, any time you hear the United States government talking
about wiretap, it requires  a wiretap requires a court order," Bush
said. "Nothing has changed, by the way. When we're talking about
chasing down terrorists, we're talking about getting a court order
before we do so."
At the time of his speech, Bush had been authorizing wiretaps without
getting approval from the FISA court for more than two years. [For
more on Bush's deceptions, see Consortiumnews.com's "Talkin' 'Texan'
Means Lying Big."
Secrecy Charade
The administration's claim about the need for extraordinary secrecy
surrounding the wiretap program is also largely a charade. Al-Qaeda
and other enemy groups have long been aware that the United States has
the capability of electronic eavesdropping and have structured their
operations accordingly.
In the Feb. 6 hearing, Gonzales acknowledged as much under questioning
from Sen. Joe Biden, D-Delaware.
Biden asked, "How has this revelation damaged the program" since the
administration's attack on the disclosure "seems to presuppose that
these very sophisticated al-Qaeda folks didn't think we were
intercepting their phone calls?"
Gonzales responded, "I think, based on my experience, it is true  you
would assume that the enemy is presuming that we are engaged in some
kind of surveillance. But if they're not reminded about it all the
time in the newspapers and in stories, they sometimes forget"  a
response that drew laughter from the citizens in the hearing room.
"You're amazed at some of the communications that exist," Gonzales
continued. "So when you keep sticking it in their face that we're
involved in some kind of surveillance, even if it's unclear in these
stories, it can't help but make a difference, I think."
In other words, Gonzales argued that the reason for the extraordinary
secrecy around the wiretap program is not that the disclosure of its
existence would alert al-Qaeda to a previously unknown U.S. spying
capability, but that newspaper stories might remind them to be a
little more cautious while chatting on the telephone.
Such a slim argument would suggest that the Bush administration has
another motive for trying to intimidate anyone  whether in the press
or in Congress  who wants to investigate the surveillance program.
On Feb. 28, reflecting on Gonzales's earlier testimony, Leahy said the
Attorney General's unresponsive answers led to the conclusion that
Gonzales "has a radically different understanding of the laws than do
many of us  the people's representatives in Congress who wrote the
As for Gonzales's responses to senators' questions about the program,
Leahy said, "whatever we asked, it was either too relevant or not
relevant enough, and either way, we were getting no answers from the
Attorney General."
A logical suspicion is that the administration is blocking a thorough
examination of the wiretapping program because it might show that Bush
followed the legal advice on his unlimited powers into pervasive
spying of his political enemies.

I have to chime in on a number of points. I'll try to keep commercial
plugs to a minimum.
* An awful lot of this discussion is some combination of outdated and
true but irrelevant. For example, it is true that usability of all
computers is not what it could be. But a lot of what has cruised by
here is similar to someone saying, "Yes, usability is atrocious --
here, look at this screenshot of Windows 3.1." Someone else pipes up,
"You think that's bad, let me show you this example from the Xerox
Alto. What*ever* were they thinking?" And then someone else says,
"Yeah, and if you think that's bad, look at what 'ls' did in Unix V6!"
Then when someone else says, "Y'know, I'm using the latest version of
Firefox, and it's actually pretty good" the next message says, "But
what about the Y2K issues, and what happens when in 2038?" I swear,
guys, this thread is the crypto version of the Monty Python "Luxury"
* Whitten and Tygar is a great paper, but it was written ages ago on
software that was released in 1997. Things aren't perfect now, but
let's talk about what's out there now. Even at the time, one of
Whitten's main points is how hard it is to apply usability to
security, because of how odd it is. As a very quick example, in most
forms of user design, you let exploration take a prominent place. But
it doesn't work in security because you can't click undo when you do
something you didn't intend.
* There are new generations of crypto software out there. I produce
the PGP products, and PGP Desktop and PGP Universal are automatic
systems that look up certs use them, automatically encrypt, and even
does both OpenPGP and S/MIME.
They're not perfect, and lead to other amusing issues. For example, an
hour ago, I was coordinating with someone that I'm meeting at a
conference. I got a reply saying, "I'm at the airport and can't
decrypt your message from my phone." I hadn't realized that I *had*
encrypted my message, because my system and my colleague's system had
been doing things for us.
I habitually send most of my email securely, but I don't think about
it. My robots take care of it for me. I tune policies, I don't encrypt
If you don't want to use my products, as Ben Laurie pointed out,
there's a very nice plugin for Thunderbird called Enigmail that makes
doing crypto painless.
* There are also new generations of keyservers out there that work on
the issues of the old servers to trim defunct keys, and manage other
issues. I have out there the PGP Global Directory. Think of it as a
mash-up of a keyserver along with Robot CA concepts and user
management goodness adapted from modern mailing list servers like
* A number of us are also re-thinking other concepts such as using
short-lived certificates based on the "freshness" model to constrain
lifecycle management issues.
* There are many challenges remaining. Heck, the fact that people here
apparently have not updated their knowledge any time this century is
part of the problem. But let me tell you that email encryption is
growing, and growing strongly. However, most of the successes are not
happening where you see them. They're happening in business, where
communities of partners decide they need to do secure email, and then
they do. This is another place where things have changed radically. A
decade ago, we thought that security would be a grass-roots phenomenon
where end-users and consumers would push security into those stodgy
businesses. What's happening now is the exact opposite -- savvy
businesses are putting together sophisticated security systems, and
that's slowly starting to get end-users to wake up.
I'd be happy to discuss at length where things are getting better,
where they aren't, and where some issues have been shuffled around.
But we do need to talk about what's going on now, not ten years ago.

you can: there are also a few companies selling faraday cloth, though i don't
recall the attenuation provided.  what i'd really like is something
toggle'able, although the product described in this thread sounds more
like snake oil than truly "nano reconfigurable faraday surface"
a friend also has an attic/loft well coated in many layers of lead
base; there are two small windows and the attenuation with lead based
appears to be pretty decent as well.  (a little hard to find these

(Posted by adam)
Kim Cameron... says: "In my view, the identity problem is one of the
hardest problems computer science has ever faced." I think this is
true, and I'd like to tackle why that is. I'm going to do that in a
couple of blog posts, because I think the subject is broad and
complex, and I'd like to offer some perspectives into that chaos.
I've been saying for a while that people like to pay for privacy, when
they understand what the threat to their privacy is, and how the
solution works. Thus, they buy curtains. Curtains work very well to
enhance privacy by stopping passers-by from looking through your
windows. Another part of that talk is that privacy means a lot of
different things to people, ranging from 'the right to be left alone'
to 'informational self-determination' to 'abortion.' I believe that
identity displays very similar properties in how widely the term is
Identity is a problem because it means so many different things about
who we are, and how we perceive ourselves, others, and our
relationships with them. Identity also entails a set of business
relationships, and the experiences and reliance that entities embed
into those relationships. Finally, identity entails a set of
government relationships, some of which are about citizenship, or
various sorts of temporary presence or exclusion, or moneys flowing to
or from the government. Sometimes, these relationships overlap in
various ways.
This relates to Zooko's "Decentralized, Secure, Human-Meaningful"
triangle. Zooko looks at the digital systems for dealing with
identifiers, and the properties those identifiers can have. I want to
start from the variety of relationships, and the way people think
about the relationships, then move to identifiers. Replacing the
actual relationship with a digital identifier often creates issues,
because the two differ.
As we encode various forms of identity onto computers, we make choices
about identifiers and representations. Some of these choices are now
such second nature that actually listing the details them seems
bizarre: "My mail client sends a message to alice at example.com"* vs "I
send mail to mom." We have internalized the idea that an email address
is a good identifier for a person. We tend to internalize these
representations fairly easily, even when its not a good idea.
"123-45-6789 applied for this credit card," that must be Alice
I'll talk more about the issues of assigning trust or reliance to
identifiers, rather than people, in another post.

 Bush declares war on freedom of the press
March 6, 2006 07:44 AM / The Rant .
By DOUG THOMPSON
Using many of the questionable surveillance and monitoring techniques
that brought both questions and criticism to his administration,
President George W. Bush has launched a war against reporters who
write stories unfavorable to his actions and is planning to prosecute
journalists to make examples of them in his "war on terrorism."
Bush recently directed Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to use
"whatever means at your disposal" to wiretap, follow, harass and
investigate journalists who have published stories about the
administration's illegal use of warrantless wiretaps, use of faulty
intelligence and anything else he deems "detrimental to the war on
Reporters for The New York Times, which along with Capitol Hill Blue
revealed use of the National Security Agency to monitor phone calls
and emails of Americans, say FBI agents have interviewed them and
criminal prosecutors at the Justice Department admit they are laying
"the groundwork for a grand jury that could lead to criminal charges,"
CIA Director Porter Goss told Congress recently that "it is my aim and
it is my hope that we will witness a grand jury investigation with
reporters present being asked to reveal who is leaking this
information. I believe the safety of this nation and the people of
this country deserve nothing less."
As part of the investigation, the Justice Department, Department of
Homeland Security and the National Security Agency are wiretapping
reporters' phones, following journalists on a daily basis, searching
their homes and offices under a USA Patriot Act provision that allows
"secret and undisclosed searches" and pouring over financial and
travel records of hundreds of Washington-based reporters.
Spokesmen for the Justice Department and Department of Homeland
Security admit there are "ongoing investigations" regarding
publication of stories "involving threats to national security" but
will not reveal what those investigations include.
In addition to using the USA Patriot Act to pry into the lives of
journalists, the Justice Department has also dusted off a pre-World
War I law to prosecute people who receive classified information,
although the law was aimed at military personnel not civilians.
"This is the first administration that I can remember, including
Nixon's, that said we need to think about a law that would put
journalists who print national security things up in front of grand
juries and put them in jail if they don't reveal their sources," says
David Gergen, who served as President Regan's director of
communication and also worked in the Nixon and Ford White Houses.
Political scientist George Harleigh, who worked in the Nixon
administration, says such use of federal law enforcement authority was
illegal when Nixon tried it and still so today.
"We're talking about a basic violation of the Constitutional guarantee
of a free press as well as a violation of the rights of privacy of
American citizens," Harleigh says. "I had hoped we would have learned
our lessons from the Nixon era. Sadly, it appears we have not."
In recent weeks, the FBI has issued hundreds of "National Security
Letters," directing employers, banks, credit card companies, libraries
and other entities to turn over records on reporters. Under the USA
Patriot Act, those who must turn over the records are also prohibited
from revealing they have done so to the subject of the federal probes.
"The significance of this cannot be overstated," says prominent New
York litigator Glenn Greenwald. "In essence, while the President sits
in the White House undisturbed after proudly announcing that he has
been breaking the law and will continue to do so, his slavish
political appointees at the Justice Department are using the mammoth
law enforcement powers of the federal government to find and
criminally prosecute those who brought this illegal conduct to light.
"This flamboyant use of the forces of criminal prosecution to threaten
whistle-blowers and intimidate journalists are nothing more than the
naked tactics of street thugs and authoritarian juntas."
Just how widespread, and uncontrolled, this latest government assault
has become hit close to home last week when one of the FBI's National
Security Letters arrived at the company that hosts the servers for
this web site, Capitol Hill Blue.
The letter demanded traffic data, payment records and other
information about the web site along with information on me, the
Now that's a problem. I own the company that hosts Capitol Hill Blue.
So, in effect, the feds want me to turn over information on myself and
not tell myself that I'm doing it. You'd think they'd know better.
I turned the letter over to my lawyer and told him to send the
following message to the feds:
Fuck you. Strong letter to follow.

White House steps up effort to halt flow of secrets
By Edward Alden in Washington
Financial Times
Updated: 9:12 p.m. ET March 6, 2006
The administration of President George W. Bush is mounting an
unprecedented effort to crack down on leaks of government secrets,
even as it is vastly expanding the range of information deemed too
sensitive to share with the public.
That twin effort has raised fears that the White House may succeed in
shutting off the flow of such information by threatening to jail those
who leak secrets and those who receive them.
The issue has come to a head in the government's efforts to prosecute
two pro-Israeli lobbyists for receiving classified information from a
Pentagon official. Larry Franklin, the official, was sentenced to 12
years in prison in January, and the lobbyists  Steven Rosen and Keith
Weissman of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee  are to go
on trial next month.
Many see the case, which relies on a novel interpretation of a
90-year-old espionage law, as a test of whether the administration can
exercise new powers to shut off leaks that have been severely
embarrassing to the White House. In particular, the Justice Department
is aggressively trying to identify the sources for two explosive news
stories: the existence of secret Central Intelligence Agency prisons
in eastern Europe, and the National Security Agency's domestic
surveillance programme.
The Washington Post reported at the weekend that dozens of officials
from both agencies had been questioned recently by the FBI in the leak
"When you have more and more information being classified, and more
and more secrets being kept, the only way reporters can get
information is when internal whistleblowers provide it. And that
drives this administration crazy," says Lucy Dalglish, executive
director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.
Since the September 11 attacks, the administration has vastly expanded
the range of information deemed secret, ranging from the serious 
such as the NSA spying programme  to the seemingly trivial. It has
begun withholding, for instance, the names and telephone numbers of
many government officials, making it more difficult for reporters and
others to track down knowledgeable sources.
In the first four years of the administration, the volume of
classified documents barred from public distribution nearly doubled to
close to 16m annually. Over the same time, declassification of
documents has slowed to a trickle.
Porter Goss, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, warned in a
Senate hearing last month that leaks had caused "severe damage" to his
agency. "It is my aim and it is my hope that we will witness a grand
jury investigation, with reporters present, being asked to reveal who
is leaking this information," he said.
That threat is the main reason the prosecution of Mr Rosen and Mr
Weissman has caused such concern. The two are accused of discussing
with Mr Franklin a classified draft memorandum regarding US policy
towards Iran. In a court memorandum filed in support of the lobbyists,
a former Justice Department official, Viet Dinh  chief architect of
the Patriot Act  argued that the prosecution would have a chilling
effect on debate over national security issues.
"Until now, no administration has attempted to address what it may
perceive as annoying or premature 'leaks' by criminalising the receipt
and use of unsolicited oral information obtained as part of the
lobbying or reporting process," he wrote.
The government's effort, he said, would in effect "create some type of
official secrets act through the prosecution of a test case against
two individuals who were engaged in a practice that defines foreign
policy lobbying  the sharing of information  in which lobbyists and
members of the press engage every day."
The US has long resisted adopting a British-style Official Secrets
Act. But support for the idea is growing. In 2000, President Bill
Clinton vetoed legislation passed by the Republican Congress that
would have criminalised unauthorised leaks of classified information,
though even that bill would not have made the receipt of such
information a crime. The Republican chairmen of both the Senate and
House intelligence committees have said recently they might make
another effort to pass such legislation.
Critics say the obsession with leaks is absurd because top White House
officials have been at the forefront of leaking the most sensitive
classified information. For instance, Lewis "Scooter" Libby, the
former chief of staff to Vice-President Dick Cheney who faces perjury
charges in the Valerie Plame case, has said in his defence that Mr
Cheney authorised him to discuss with some reporters the CIA's
classified 2002 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq's weapons
programmes in the run-up to the Iraq war. Newspaper stories based on
the false claims in the NIE that Iraq possessed chemical and
biological weapons, and was developing nuclear arms, helped build US
public support for invading Iraq.
In a television interview last month, Mr Cheney said he had the power
to declassify such information, citing an executive order signed by
the president. This is precisely why the system for classifying
secrets is open to abuse, according to Thomas Blanton, director of the
National Security Archive, which presses for declassification of
information. "The fact is that most of the leaks that take place are
coming from very high-ranking officials, up to and including the
The crackdown on leaks, he said, was a result of White House anger
that mid-level officials were "in open revolt" against policies. "The
top officials can't tell the real secrets from the embarrassments, and
they are reacting to the embarrassments," he said. "It destroys the
credibility we need to maintain the real secrets."

of sweeping powers that Bush has asserted to fight the War on Terror,
"Can it be true that any President really has such powers under our
Constitution? If the answer is 'yes,' then under the theory by which
these acts are committed, are there any acts that can on their face be
    In such extraordinary circumstances, the American people might
legitimately ask exactly what the Bush administration means by the
"rapid development of new programs," which might require the
construction of a new network of detention camps.
Bush's Mysterious 'New Programs'
by Nat Parry; Truthout ; March 08, 2006
    Not that George W. Bush needs much encouragement, but Sen. Lindsey
Graham suggested to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales a new target for
the administration's domestic operations - Fifth Columnists,
supposedly disloyal Americans who sympathize and collaborate with the
    "The administration has not only the right, but the duty, in my
opinion, to pursue Fifth Column movements," Graham, R-S.C., told
Gonzales during Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Feb. 6.
    "I stand by this President's ability, inherent to being Commander
in Chief, to find out about Fifth Column movements, and I don't think
you need a warrant to do that," Graham added, volunteering to work
with the administration to draft guidelines for how best to neutralize
this alleged threat.
    "Senator," a smiling Gonzales responded, "the President already
said we'd be happy to listen to your ideas."
    In less paranoid times, Graham's comments might be viewed by many
Americans as a Republican trying to have it both ways - ingratiating
himself to an administration of his own party while seeking some
credit from Washington centrists for suggesting Congress should have
at least a tiny say in how Bush runs the War on Terror.
    But recent developments suggest that the Bush administration may
already be contemplating what to do with Americans who are deemed
insufficiently loyal or who disseminate information that may be
considered helpful to the enemy.
    Top US officials have cited the need to challenge news that
undercuts Bush's actions as a key front in defeating the terrorists,
who are aided by "news informers" in the words of Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld.
    Detention Centers
    Plus, there was that curious development in January when the Army
Corps of Engineers awarded Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown & Root
a $385 million contract to construct detention centers somewhere in
the United States, to deal with "an emergency influx of immigrants
into the US, or to support the rapid development of new programs," KBR
said. [Market Watch, Jan. 26, 2006]
    Later, the New York Times reported that "KBR would build the
centers for the Homeland Security Department for an unexpected influx
of immigrants, to house people in the event of a natural disaster or
for new programs that require additional detention space." [Feb. 4,
    Like most news stories on the KBR contract, the Times focused on
concerns about Halliburton's reputation for bilking US taxpayers by
overcharging for sub-par services.
    "It's hard to believe that the administration has decided to
entrust Halliburton with even more taxpayer dollars," remarked Rep.
Henry Waxman, D-California.
    Less attention centered on the phrase "rapid development of new
programs" and what kind of programs would require a major expansion of
detention centers, each capable of holding 5,000 people. Jamie
Zuieback, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement,
declined to elaborate on what these "new programs" might be.
    Only a few independent journalists, such as Peter Dale Scott and
Maureen Farrell, have pursued what the Bush administration might
actually be thinking.
    Scott speculated that the "detention centers could be used to
detain American citizens if the Bush administration were to declare
martial law."
    He recalled that during the Reagan administration, National
Security Council aide Oliver North organized Rex-84 "readiness
exercise," which contemplated the Federal Emergency Management Agency
rounding up and detaining 400,000 "refugees," in the event of
"uncontrolled population movements" over the Mexican border into the
United States.
    Farrell pointed out that because "another terror attack is all but
certain, it seems far more likely that the centers would be used for
post-911-type detentions of immigrants rather than a sudden deluge" of
immigrants flooding across the border.
    Vietnam-era whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg said, "Almost certainly
this is preparation for a roundup after the next 9/11 for
Mid-Easterners, Muslims and possibly dissenters. They've already done
this on a smaller scale, with the 'special registration' detentions of
immigrant men from Muslim countries, and with Guantanamo."
    Labor Camps
    There also was another little-noticed item posted at the US Army
Web site, about the Pentagon's Civilian Inmate Labor Program. This
program "provides Army policy and guidance for establishing civilian
inmate labor programs and civilian prison camps on Army
    The Army document, first drafted in 1997, underwent a "rapid
action revision" on Jan. 14, 2005. The revision provides a "template
for developing agreements" between the Army and corrections facilities
for the use of civilian inmate labor on Army installations.
    On its face, the Army's labor program refers to inmates housed in
federal, state and local jails. The Army also cites various federal
laws that govern the use of civilian labor and provide for the
establishment of prison camps in the United States, including a
federal statute that authorizes the Attorney General to "establish,
equip, and maintain camps upon sites selected by him" and "make
available ... the services of United States prisoners" to various
government departments, including the Department of Defense.
    Though the timing of the document's posting - within the past few
weeks - may just be a coincidence, the reference to a "rapid action
revision" and the KBR contract's contemplation of "rapid development
of new programs" have raised eyebrows about why this sudden need for
    These developments also are drawing more attention now because of
earlier Bush administration policies to involve the Pentagon in
    operations inside the United States.
    Pentagon Surveillance
    Despite the Posse Comitatus Act's prohibitions against US military
personnel engaging in domestic law enforcement, the Pentagon has
expanded its operations beyond previous boundaries, such as its role
in domestic surveillance activities.
    The Washington Post has reported that since the Sept. 11, 2001,
terror attacks, the Defense Department has been creating new agencies
that gather and analyze intelligence within the United States.
[Washington Post, Nov.
    27, 2005]
    The White House also is moving to expand the power of the
Pentagon's Counterintelligence Field Activity (CIFA), created three
years ago to consolidate counterintelligence operations. The White
House proposal would transform CIFA into an office that has authority
to investigate crimes such as treason, terrorist sabotage or economic
    The Pentagon also has pushed legislation in Congress that would
create an intelligence exception to the Privacy Act, allowing the FBI
and others to share information about US citizens with the Pentagon,
CIA and other intelligence agencies. But some in the Pentagon don't
seem to think that new laws are even necessary.
    In a 2001 Defense Department memo that surfaced in January 2006,
the US Army's top intelligence officer wrote, "Contrary to popular
belief, there is no absolute ban on [military] intelligence components
collecting US person information."
    Drawing a distinction between "collecting" information and
"receiving" information on US citizens, the memo argued that "MI
[military intelligence] may receive information from anyone, anytime."
[See CQ.com, Jan. 31, 2005]
    This receipt of information presumably would include data from the
National Security Agency, which has been engaging in surveillance of
US citizens without court-approved warrants in apparent violation of
the Foreign Intelligence Security Act. Bush approved the program of
warrantless wiretaps shortly after 9/11.
    There also may be an even more extensive surveillance program.
Former NSA employee Russell D. Tice told a congressional committee on
Feb. 14 that such a top-secret surveillance program existed, but he
said he couldn't discuss the details without breaking classification
    Tice added that the "special access" surveillance program may be
violating the constitutional rights of millions of Americans. [UPI,
Feb. 14, 2006]
    With this expanded surveillance, the government's list of
terrorist suspects is rapidly swelling.
    The Washington Post reported on Feb. 15 that the National
Counterterrorism Center's central repository now holds the names of
325,000 terrorist suspects, a four-fold increase since the fall of
    Asked whether the names in the repository were collected through
the NSA's domestic surveillance program, an NCTC official told the
Post, "Our database includes names of known and suspected
international terrorists provided by all intelligence community
organizations, including NSA."
    Homeland Defense
    As the administration scoops up more and more names, members of
Congress also have questioned the elasticity of Bush's definitions for
words like terrorist "affiliates," used to justify wiretapping
Americans allegedly in contact with such people or entities.
    During the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing on the wiretap
program, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, complained that the
House and Senate Intelligence Committees "have not been briefed on the
scope and nature of the program."
    Feinstein added that, therefore, the committees "have not been
able to explore what is a link or an affiliate to al-Qaeda or what
minimization procedures (for purging the names of innocent people) are
in place."
    The combination of the Bush administration's expansive reading of
its own power and its insistence on extraordinary secrecy has raised
the alarm of civil libertarians when contemplating how far the
Pentagon might go in involving itself in domestic matters.
    A Defense Department document, entitled the "Strategy for Homeland
Defense and Civil Support," has set out a military strategy against
terrorism that envisions an "active, layered defense" both inside and
outside US territory. In the document, the Pentagon pledges to
"transform US military forces to execute homeland defense missions in
the ... US homeland."
    The Pentagon strategy paper calls for increased military
reconnaissance and surveillance to "defeat potential challengers
before they threaten the United States." The plan "maximizes threat
awareness and seizes the initiative from those who would harm us."
    But there are concerns over how the Pentagon judges "threats" and
who falls under the category "those who would harm us." A Pentagon
official said the Counterintelligence Field Activity's TALON program
has amassed files on antiwar protesters.
    In December 2005, NBC News revealed the existence of a secret
400-page Pentagon document listing 1,500 "suspicious incidents" over a
10-month period, including dozens of small antiwar demonstrations that
were classified as a "threat."
    The Defense Department also might be moving toward legitimizing
the use of propaganda domestically, as part of its overall war
    A secret Pentagon "Information Operations Roadmap," approved by
Rumsfeld in October 2003, calls for "full spectrum" information
operations and notes that "information intended for foreign audiences,
including public diplomacy and PSYOP, increasingly is consumed by our
domestic audience and vice-versa."
    "PSYOPS messages will often be replayed by the news media for much
larger audiences, including the American public," the document states.
The Pentagon argues, however, that "the distinction between foreign
and domestic audiences becomes more a question of USG [US government]
intent rather than information dissemination practices."
    It calls for "boundaries" between information operations abroad
and the news media at home, but does not outline any corresponding
limits on PSYOP campaigns.
    Similar to the distinction the Pentagon draws between "collecting"
and "receiving" intelligence on US citizens, the Information
Operations Roadmap argues that as long as the American public is not
intentionally "targeted," any PSYOP propaganda consumed by the
American public is acceptable.
    The Pentagon plan also includes a strategy for taking over the
Internet and controlling the flow of information, viewing the Web as a
potential military adversary. The "roadmap" speaks of "fighting the
net," and implies that the Internet is the equivalent of "an enemy
weapons system."
    In a speech on Feb. 17 to the Council on Foreign Relations,
Rumsfeld elaborated on the administration's perception that the battle
over information would be a crucial front in the War on Terror, or as
Rumsfeld calls it, the Long War.
    "Let there be no doubt, the longer it takes to put a strategic
communication framework into place, the more we can be certain that
the vacuum will be filled by the enemy and by news informers that most
assuredly will not paint an accurate picture of what is actually
taking place," Rumsfeld said.
    The Department of Homeland Security also has demonstrated a
tendency to deploy military operatives to deal with domestic crises.
    In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the department dispatched
"heavily armed paramilitary mercenaries from the Blackwater private
security firm, infamous for their work in Iraq, (and had them) openly
patrolling the streets of New Orleans," reported journalists Jeremy
Scahill and Daniela Crespo on Sept.
    10, 2005.
    Noting the reputation of the Blackwater mercenaries as "some of
the most feared professional killers in the world," Scahill and Crespo
said Blackwater's presence in New Orleans "raises alarming questions
about why the government would allow men trained to kill with impunity
in places like Iraq and Afghanistan to operate here."
    US Battlefield
    In the view of some civil libertarians, a form of martial law
already exists in the United States and has been in place since
shortly after the 9/11 attacks when Bush issued Military Order No. 1
which empowered him to detain any non-citizen as an international
terrorist or enemy combatant.
    "The President decided that he was no longer running the country
as a civilian President," wrote civil rights attorney Michael Ratner
in the book
    Guantanamo: What the World Should Know. "He issued a military
order giving himself the power to run the country as a general."
    For any American citizen suspected of collaborating with
terrorists, Bush also revealed what's in store. In May 2002, the FBI
arrested US citizen Jose Padilla in Chicago on suspicion that he might
be an al-Qaeda operative planning an attack.
    Rather than bring criminal charges, Bush designated Padilla an
"enemy combatant" and had him imprisoned indefinitely without benefit
of due process. After three years, the administration finally brought
charges against Padilla, in order to avoid a Supreme Court showdown
the White House might have lost.
    But since the Court was not able to rule on the Padilla case, the
administration's arguments have not been formally repudiated. Indeed,
despite filing charges against Padilla, the White House still asserts
the right to detain US citizens without charges as enemy combatants.
    This claimed authority is based on the assertion that the United
States is at war and the American homeland is part of the battlefield.
    "In the war against terrorists of global reach, as the Nation
learned all too well on Sept. 11, 2001, the territory of the United
States is part of the battlefield," Bush's lawyers argued in briefs to
the federal courts. [Washington Post, July 19, 2005]
    Given Bush's now open assertions that he is using his "plenary" -
or unlimited - powers as Commander in Chief for the duration of the
indefinite War on Terror, Americans can no longer trust that their
constitutional rights protect them from government actions.
    As former Vice President Al Gore asked after recounting a litany
of sweeping powers that Bush has asserted to fight the War on Terror,
"Can it be true that any President really has such powers under our
Constitution? If the answer is 'yes,' then under the theory by which
these acts are committed, are there any acts that can on their face be
    In such extraordinary circumstances, the American people might
legitimately ask exactly what the Bush administration means by the
"rapid development of new programs," which might require the
construction of a new network of detention camps.

heh, wonder who did it?  wonder if 'The Citizens' Commission to
Investigate the FBI' is an idea whose time has come (back again?)
A break-in to end all break-ins
In 1971, stolen FBI files exposed the government's domestic spying program.
By Allan M. Jalon
ALLAN M. JALON is a longtime contributor to The Times and other
publications on issues of culture and media.
March 8, 2006
THIRTY-FIVE YEARS ago today, a group of anonymous activists broke into
the small, two-man office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in
Media, Pa., and stole more than 1,000 FBI documents that revealed
years of systematic wiretapping, infiltration and media manipulation
designed to suppress dissent.
The Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI, as the group called
itself, forced its way in at night with a crowbar while much of the
country was watching the Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier fight. When agents
arrived for work the next morning, they found the file cabinets
virtually emptied.
Within a few weeks, the documents began to show up  mailed
anonymously in manila envelopes with no return address  in the
newsrooms of major American newspapers. When the Washington Post
received copies, Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell asked Executive Editor
Ben Bradlee not to publish them because disclosure, he said, could
"endanger the lives" of people involved in investigations on behalf of
the United States.
Nevertheless, the Post broke the first story on March 24, 1971, after
receiving an envelope with 14 FBI documents detailing how the bureau
had enlisted a local police chief, letter carriers and a switchboard
operator at Swarthmore College to spy on campus and black activist
groups in the Philadelphia area.
More documents went to other reporters  Tom Wicker received copies at
his New York Times office; so did reporters at the Los Angeles Times 
and to politicians including Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota and
Rep. Parren J. Mitchell of Maryland.
To this day, no individual has claimed responsibility for the
break-in. The FBI, after building up a six-year, 33,000-page file on
the case, couldn't solve it. But it remains one of the most lastingly
consequential (although underemphasized) watersheds of political
awareness in recent American history, one that poses tough questions
even today for our national leaders who argue that fighting foreign
enemies requires the government to spy on its citizens. The break-in
is far less well known than Daniel Ellsberg's leak of the Pentagon
Papers three months later, but in my opinion it deserves equal
Found among the Media documents was a new word, "COINTELPRO," short
for the FBI's "secret counterintelligence program," created to
investigate and disrupt dissident political groups in the U.S. Under
these programs, beginning in 1956, the bureau worked to "enhance the
paranoia endemic in these circles," as one COINTELPRO memo put it, "to
get the point across there is an FBI agent behind every mailbox."
The Media documents  along with further revelations about COINTELPRO
in the months and years that followed  made it clear that the bureau
had gone beyond mere intelligence-gathering to discredit, destabilize
and demoralize groups  many of them peaceful, legal civil rights
organizations and antiwar groups  that the FBI and Director J. Edgar
Hoover found offensive or threatening.
For instance, agents sought to persuade Martin Luther King Jr. to kill
himself just before he received the Nobel Prize. They sent him a
composite tape made from bugs planted illegally in his hotel rooms
when he was entertaining women other than his wife  and threatened to
make it public. "King, there is one thing left for you to do. You know
what it is," FBI operatives wrote in their anonymous letter.
Under COINTELPRO, the bureau also targeted actress Jean Seberg for
having made a donation to the Black Panther Party. The fragile actress
ultimately committed suicide after a gossip nugget based on a FBI
wiretap was leaked to the L.A. Times and published. The item,
suggesting that the father of the baby she was carrying was a Black
Panther rather than her French writer-husband, turned out to be wrong.
The sheer reach of a completely politicized FBI was one of the most
frightening revelations of the Media documents. Underground newspapers
were targeted. Students (and their professors) were targeted.
Celebrities were targeted. The Communist Party of the U.S.A., the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Student Non-Violent
Organizing Committee, the Black Panther Party, the Women's Strike for
Peace  all were targeted. "Neutralize them in the same manner they
are trying to destroy and neutralize the U.S.," one memo said.
Eventually, the COINTELPRO memos  some from Media and some unearthed
later  prompted hearings led by Rep. Don Edwards of California and by
Sen. Frank Church of Idaho on intelligence agency abuses. In the
mid-1970s, the wayward agency began finally to be reined in.
It is tragic when people lose faith in their government to the extent
that they feel they must break laws to expose corruption.
But a war that had been started and sustained by lies had gone on for
years. And a government had betrayed its citizens, manipulating their
fear to strengthen its grip on power.
Today, again, many people worry that their government may be on the
road to subverting its own ideals. I hope that the commemoration of
those unknown activists being held today in Media, Pa., will serve as
a reminder that fighting for democracy abroad must remain more than
merely an excuse to weaken civil liberties at home.

some additional details on this interesting tap,,,
looks like it was indeed an inside job (and of the vodafone tech's
mysteriously committed suicide after the tapping was exposed? hmmm)
basically they hooked their spyware into the CALEA like features which
come standard in any commercial softswitch implementation and used it
to capture and relay conversations to the pool of a dozen or so pre
paid wireless phones.  [note that CALEA isn't that complicated; it's
simply a one way conference resource attached to a specific
span/channel that is relayed to eve.]
funny how vodafone is trying to avoid any responsibility by
highlighting the fact an ericsson insider wrote the code, while
conveniently failing to mention it was a vodafone tech who put it in
place. :)
The CEO of Vodafone Greece George Koronias told a Parliamentary
investigation on Thursday that Vodafone had at no time purchased the
software used to carry out the illegal phone taps through its digital
systems, while stressing that the people responsible had to have
extremely high technical expertise and a deep knowledge of Ericsson's
programming environment.
During his testimony, Koronias stressed that Vodafone had "not
requested, not ordered and not received" the legal low-phone
interception programme developed by Ericsson, which the phone-tappers
had managed to activate in order to monitor the roughly 100 mobile
phones that were under surveillance.
He said that the low-phone interception programme was added to
Ericsson systems at the request of its customers after the September
11 attacks, but underlined the costly service had not been purchased
by Vodafone.
Koronias also emphasised that the Greek mobile-phone provider had
never been officially aware of the inactive low-phone interception
software's presence in its systems, but only the supplier Ericsson.
At the same time he pointed out that Vodafone, as a provider, would
not be given access to the source code for the software. Ericsson did
not provide this to its customers and the software was operated only
Ericsson's authorised staff, he said.
Asked who might have made the 'rogue' software, Koronias said that it
would have to be someone with intimate knowledge of Ericsson's
programming environment that could write directy in assembly language,
which operators were not able to do.
"The complexity of the programme points to someone with extremely high
expertise," Koronias said, while clarifying that Vodafone's staff did
not possess this level of skill.
Regarding the death of Vodafone staff member Costas Tsalikidis,
Koronias said that he had brought this to the attention of the
ministers and the Supreme Court prosecutor, placing himself and the
company at their disposal, because it had coincided with the discovery
of the 'ghost' software and informing the government.
In a re-opened investigation into Tsalikidis' death that is now
underway, meanwhile, first-instance court prosecutor Ioannis Diotis on
Thursday heard testimony from the coroner Giorgios Dilernia who
examined the body at the time and the head of the coroners' service
Philippos Koutsaftis.
Dilernia said the 39-year-old's death had clearly been caused by
hanging, while both coroners agreed on a verdict of suicide and said
that disinterment of the body would not bring about any result.
Tsalikidis was found hanged in March 2005, just days after the company
discovered the 'ghost' software in its systems and informed the
government. A police investigation at the time had attributed the
death to suicide but this has been questioned by the family,
especially in the light of later developments and the revelations
about the phone-tapping scandal.

 Telling the 'approved' story
March 7, 2006 01:12 AM / The Rant .
By DOUG THOMPSON
On an unspecified day last week an employee of a federal agency that
cannot be revealed delivered a document that cannot be identified to a
company that cannot be named seeking information that cannot be
The aforementioned federal agent left the unidentified document with
an employee of the unnamed company. That employee then called the
owner, who must remain anonymous, to inform him that the document that
could not be identified sought information that could not be
discussed. The owner who must remain anonymous instructed the employee
to deliver the unidentified document to a lawyer whose name is
protected by attorney-client privilege.
The lawyer whose name is protected by attorney-client privilege
examined the unidentified document and then reviewed the information
that could not be discussed with the owner who must remain anonymous.
With the approval of the owner who must remain anonymous, the lawyer
whose name is protected by attorney-client privilege contacted a U.S.
attorney who demanded that his identity be concealed.
The U.S. attorney who demanded that his identity be concealed then
claimed the owner who must remain anonymous violated a law that could
not be disclosed and faced arrest for charges that could not be
specified because he had referred to the document that cannot be
identified in an article for a certain, but unnamed, web site.
The lawyer whose name is protected by attorney-client privilege argued
that his client could not be charged under the undisclosed law because
he had been acting as a journalist at the time of the alleged
publication and not as the owner of the company that cannot be named.
He had, in fact, learned of the existence of the document that cannot
be identified from a third-party, who was not named, and was not aware
of its exact contents because he had not seen or read the document
and, therefore, was not aware of the exact contents that cannot be
The U.S. attorney who demanded his identity be concealed consulted
with others who names are classified and concluded that the owner who
must remain anonymous walked a fine line between legal and illegal and
would not face arrest for violating a law that could not be disclosed
on charges that could not be specified.
So walking this fine line of justice allowed the owner who must remain
anonymous to avoid confinement at an institution at an unknown
location for an unspecified length of time.
In exchange for his freedom, the owner who must remain anonymous
agreed to write a "clarification" of what happened, following the
guidelines for publication laid down by the Bush administration.
Which is what you just read.

the class of the public exponents $e$ for which there exist an integer
$m$ with $1\leq m\leq {\log{N}\over \log{32}}$ and small integers $u$,
$X$, $Y$ and $Z$ satisfying $$(e+u)Y^m-\psi(N)X^m=Z,$$ where
$\psi(N)=(p+1)(q-1)$. First we show that these exponents are of
improper use in RSA cryptosystems."
"Cryptanalysis of RSA with constrained keys ... We show that choosing

Here's a 1997 paper on "quantum computing in the large" that I had
been asking about:
"Neil Gershenfeld and Isaac Chuang have developed an entirely new
approach to quantum computation that promises to solve many of these
problems. Instead of carefully isolating a small number of qubits, we
use a large thermal ensemble (such as a cup of coffee). Such a system
has ~10^23 degrees of freedom; by applying RF pulses that excite
nuclear magnetic resonances, we can create a tiny deviation from
equilibrium that acts just like a much smaller number of pure qubits."

We don't burn our sources
March 9, 2006 05:25 AM / The Rant .
By DOUG THOMPSON
One of the questions frequently raised by critics of this web site is
"how can you guys have sources the mainstream media doesn't have?"
Good question. We often quote confidential sources in our stories. We
have a choice of depending on such sources or not publishing the
story. If I'm satisfied the sources are accurate I go with the story.
It's a question of trust and, during my 23 years in Washington as both
a journalist and a political operative, I built up a network of
sources I trust and who trust me to protect their identity and not put
them in harm's way. More than 40 years in journalism taught me to
protect such sources at all cost.
Many of those same sources don't trust the so-called "mainstream
media" outlets because they've been burned by journalists who put the
story ahead of protecting those who provide them with the information.
Even worse, the mainstreamers can be downright sloppy when it comes to
protecting those who have such information.
On Monday, I outlined how the Bush Administration has launched an
all-out war on the press, directing attorney general Alberto Gonzales
to go after reporters with subpoenas, wiretaps, monitoring of emails
and surveillance to try and stop leaks about the many questionable
activities of the White House.
I learned about the efforts because the FBI made the incredibly stupid
mistake of sending one of their "National Security Letters" to a
company I own demanding information on one of its clients - me.
Then I confirmed the story with my administration sources and ran with
it on Monday, knowing that even acknowledging receipt of a National
Security Letter could lead to trouble.  The letter was withdrawn after
my attorney negotiated a deal.
On Tuesday, an email arrived from Dan Eggen, Justice Department
correspondent for The Washington Post. Dan wanted a copy of the letter
and more information on the story.

monitoring the email of journalists and a journalist fires off an

FBI sent the letter to my web hosting company offices which are 300
miles away from my home and studio. At my instructions it went from
the employee who received it straight to my attorney and he dealt
directly with the feds. I never saw the letter, do not know what
happened to it and am not privy to details of what it said. I don't
want to know. That's why I'm still sitting here and not on my way to

In 1981 I served on a panel discussion with Fred Graham, then legal
correspondent for CBS News.  During a break I told him about a paper I
once worked for, The Alton Telegraph in Illinois, which had lost a
landmark libel suit for something they never published. I thought it
might make a good story about injustice.
Instead, Graham turned the story over to Morley Safer and 60 Minutes
and they put together a hatchet job on the newspaper and told the
story from a trial lawyer's point of view. Instead of defending
freedom of the press, Safer and his crew sensationalized the story for
Some years later, we would learn again just how 60 Minutes and CBS
News hangs people out to dry. Jeffrey Wigand, a fired corporate vice
president for Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co., blew the whistle on the
company's campaign to hide the true dangers of nicotine. But 60
Minutes and Mike Wallace caved to corporate pressure and shelved the
story after revealing Wigand's identity. His reputation was ruined by
the network's incompetence.
Given such track records, why should any source trust the
mainstreamers?  The Washington Post sends an unsecure email openly
asking me to violate federal law by turning over a classified document
and I'm supposed to believe they will protect sources that I've
cultivated and protected for more than two decades?

My sources know better than to use phone lines and email to contact

reporters who are less careful.
I've been hauled in front of grand juries by overzealous prosecutors
who wanted names of sources. They didn't get them. As a journalist, I
was trained to develop my own network of sources, not call other
reporters and ask them to give up theirs.
Maybe I'm too old-fashioned for today's pop-culture journalism. Maybe
it's out of style for reporters to do their own legwork and research
instead of depending on Google and others to do it for them.
Or maybe I'm just too old to change and too damn suspicious to get
trapped by youngsters. My mama drowned the dumb ones.

Mar. 13, 2006
Via has announced a next-generation family of mini-ITX boards based on
its new C7 processor family. "Epia EN" boards will offer a large
performance boost over previous Epia boards, Via says. They target
thin clients, car PCs, robotics, medical equipment, kiosks, and server
(Click for larger view of Via Epia EN)
Initial Epia EN boards will feature C7 processors clocked at 1.5GHz,
or else an "Eden" version of the C7 clocked at 1.2GHz, for passively
cooled applications. Advanced features include support for 533/400MHz
DDR2 RAM, gigabit Ethernet, and an onboard SATA II RAID 0, 1, and O+1

The EN-series will eventually offer models clocked to 2GHz, with
frontside-bus speeds up to 800MHz, Via says.
First C7-equipped mini-ITX boards from Via
The Epia EN boards will be the first mini-ITX boards to feature Via's
next-generation x86-compatible processors, the C7 desktop, C7-M
mobile, and C7-Eden embedded processors. All three are based on the
same "C5J Esther" core, with different testing requirements and
Touted features of the C5J Esther core include support for SSE2 and
SSE3 instructions, said to improve 3D performance; a full-speed FPU
(floating point unit), rather than the half-speed unit of earlier Via
chips; 16 pipeline stages; and 128KB each of L1 and L2 cache. The core
also integrates Via's cryptography hardware. It has a die size of 30
square millimeters, and is manufactured by IBM using 90-namometer SOI
(silicon-on-insulator) technology.

(Click to enlarge)
The C7-series chips have a TDP (thermal design power, aka maximum
power draw) of 12 Watts when clocked at 1.5GHz, Via says -- or about
half that of a Celeron-M. Additionally, the chips dissipate 20 Watts
when clocked at 2GHz, Via says, and offer better performance-per-Watt
than Intel's venerable Pentium M, it claims.

Via announced the C7 in May of last year -- see that announcement for
lots more details about the chip.
CN700 Northbridge
Along with new C7 and C7-M processors, the Epia EN-series boards will
use Via's relatively new CN700 chipset, which just began sampling in
December. The chipset includes a new "CN700" northbridge, along with a
VT8237-series southbridge connected through a V-link host controller.

(Click to enlarge)
Claimed performance leap
Benchmarking against older mini-ITX boards based on C3 processors
shows the C7-based Epia EN-series boards to offer 55 percent better
results on MPEG encoding, 40 better results on business productivity
performance, and about 10 percent better results on 3D graphics
performance tests, Via reports.
C3 v. C7 benchmark results
(Source: Via)
In addition to better performance, and performance-per-Watt, Via says
the EN-series boards are more reliable, thanks to low heat
dissipation. They are not as dependent as most boards on mechanical
cooling systems, and don't generate enough heat to damage board
components, Via says.
Other claimed features include:
    * ATX power
    * DDRII 400/533 memory socket
    * UDMA 66/100/133 connectors
    * CN700 Northbridge
    * VT8237R+ Southbridge
    * PCI connector
    * LVDS/DVI modules available
    * 6-channel audio
    * Switchable (jumpers) S/PDIF / S-Video port
    * PS-2 connectors
    * USB 2.0
    * Gigabit Ethernet
Via has not announced specific EN-series board availability, but says
that boards will be available at a variety of price points soon.

@_subject: The topology of covert conflict 
an interesting paper...
"Abstract. Often an attacker tries to disconnect a network by
destroying nodes or edges, while the defender counters using various
resilience mechanisms. Examples include a music industry body
attempting to close down a peer-to-peer file-sharing network; medics
attempting to halt the spread of an infectious disease by selective
vaccination; and a police agency trying to decapitate a terrorist
organisation. Albert, Jeong and Barabasi famously analysed the static
case, and showed that vertex-order attacks are effective against
scale-free networks. We extend this work to the dynamic case by
developing a framework based on evolutionary game theory to explore
the interaction of attack and defence strategies. We show, first, that
naive defences don't work against vertex-order attack; second, that
defences based on simple redundancy don't work much better, but that
defences based on cliques work well; third, that attacks based on
centrality work better against clique defences than vertex-order
attacks do; and fourth, that defences based on complex strategies such
as delegation plus clique resist centrality attacks better than simple
clique defences. Our models thus build a bridge between network
analysis and evolutionary game theory, and provide a framework for
analysing defence and attack in networks where topology matters. They
suggest definitions of efficiency of attack and defence, and may even
explain the evolution of insurgent organisations from networks of
cells to a more virtual leadership that facilitates operations rather
than directing them. Finally, we draw some conclusions and present
possible directions for future research..."

my comments below,
limit even attempted utilization of services to authenticated users -
that's a good idea.  port knocking is a poor implementation though.
you can do strong single packet authentication without the additive
latency of port knocking, and it is a cleaner design. (see
 for
i've talked about IPsec stacks keyed out of band which give you a
robust "authenticated peers only" configuration without esoteric port
knocking / SPA methods.  unfortunately right now the options available
are static pre shared key (setkey) which is insecure without some
scripting/munging around single use keys. (this should change soon,
for some lax definition of 'soon')
it'd be nice to expand the keying options for those who wish to avoid
exposing any services above the IP stack without proper
authentication. (that means no IKE ports either).  i'm a huge fan of
OpenVPN and IPsec private networking, though IPsec is better suited
for this "no services for the unauthenticated" mode of operation.
this is the only thing port knocking it has going for it; SPA or VPN's
are a much stronger solution.
this is a particularly significant concern over wireless networks, and
when you add sophisticated authentication you might as well jump ship
to SPA or VPN instead (since you're going to be spending additional
effort managing credentials anyway - do it right and be done with it!)

Lawyer thinks office was searched in secret
Surveillance - A Portland attorney, who represents a Saudi, cites
suspicious circumstances
Tuesday, March 21, 2006
BRYAN DENSON
A Portland lawyer suspects that federal authorities executed
warrantless searches of his Lloyd Center office to collect information
about a client who is the subject of an international terrorism
Tom Nelson, who represents Saudi national Soliman al-Buthi, previously
filed a complaint that alleged warrantless interception of phone and
e-mail communications between al-Buthi and his other lawyers.
"We allege in our complaint not only that they intercepted
communications without a warrant, but they used the interceptions to
the disadvantage of the client," Nelson said.
Nelson thinks government agents, with no judicial supervision, entered
his office on a number of occasions last year. He first raised the
suspicion in September in a letter to Karin Immergut, the U.S.
attorney for Oregon, who wrote back saying she was aware of no such
warrantless searches. Nelson recounted his fears about warrantless
searches by the National Security Agency in a story this week in U.S.
News & World Report.
Two years ago, the federal government charged al-Buthi, who headed an
Ashland nonprofit called al-Haramain Islamic Foundation, with taking
charitable donations totaling $130,000 in traveler's checks out of the
United States. Federal authorities have accused the al-Haramain parent
organization, based in Saudi Arabia, of ties to Osama bin Laden.
Nelson thinks that while he was representing al-Buthi on the criminal
charge and attempting to rid his client of a suspected "global
terrorist" designation that someone posing as a janitor repeatedly
tried to, and apparently did, enter his Lloyd Center office after
Attorney Jonathan Norling, who shares office space with Nelson, said
he was sleeping on a couch at their practice early one morning last
May when a man dressed as a custodian tried to enter Nelson's office.
Norling startled the man twice one night in July when he caught the
man trying to enter the locked office.
Norling also suspects federal authorities were trying to collect
information from Nelson's desk and computer. Whoever it was, he said,
had a badge for the building that appeared valid.
"This person clearly wasn't a cleaning crew," Norling said. "I know
the cleaning crew. They come in at different times. They have a cart,
and this guy didn't have a cart. . . . I've worked here seven years,
and I've worked a lot of late nights, and I never experienced anything
like that until Tom was working (on this case)."
Nelson was suspicious of the government, having briefly represented
Brandon Mayfield, the lawyer wrongly accused of the 2004 terrorist
attack in Spain. Mayfield was the subject of intense federal
Nelson's suspicions deepened when he found that his computer had
inexplicably been rebooted and that papers in his cluttered office had
been moved around. "I'm not the world's best housekeeper," he said,
"but I know where things are."
After a few suspicious experiences, Nelson took his al-Buthi files to
his home in Zigzag. There he experienced what he described as
unexplained lapses in his burglar alarm, failures that the company
that monitors the alarm couldn't adequately explain.
On Sept. 23, he fired off the first of two letters to Immergut, the
U.S. attorney for Oregon, complaining of "strong indications that my
office and my home have been the target of clandestine searches"
related to the al-Buthi case. Immergut responded Jan. 19 that she
stood by her earlier statements: She was aware of no such searches
under her watch. Immergut wrote that she assumed he was referring to
news reports about clandestine intercepts by the NSA.
Immergut pointed out in her response that the NSA and Department of
Justice were separate agencies. In an interview Monday, she added,
"The (NSA) is not required to come to the U.S. attorney for the
district of Oregon for authorization to conduct any kind of searches."
All of which keeps Nelson scratching his head.
"I have no proof the government's doing these things," he said. "I
just have a very healthy suspicion they are."

you can stress /dev/random via 'bench-rng /dev/random 1024 1000000' or
simply 'cat /dev/random > /dev/null'.
uptime would be helpful.  note that i accidentally left "forgiving
fips check" set in the rcS.mtrngd script; this can be turned off for a
better real world test.  the forgiving option does not fail blocks
with poker or bit runs.  monobit, long, and continuous runs are always
critical and the block is discarded.
the FIPS check block size is 1500 bytes.  see
 for more info.
by default entropy density is at 80% so take that into consideration
when calculating available /dev/random throughput.  ex:
entropy add bytes ....: 104036872320  x  0.80 == 83,229,497,856 Bytes
of actual entropy added to /dev/random pool.

Creating a secure password:
    o Include punctuation marks and numbers.
    o Mix capital, lowercase and space characters.
    o Create a unique acronym.
    o Short passwords should be 8 chars at least.
Weaknesses to avoid:
    o Don't use a password that is listed as an example or public.
    o Don't use a password you have been using for years.
    o Don't use a password someone else has seen you type.
    o Don't use a password that contains personal information.
    o Don't use words or acronyms that can be found in a dictionary.
    o Don't use keyboard patterns (qwerty) or sequential numbers.
    o Don't use repeating characters (aa11).
Keep your password secure:
    o Never tell your password to anyone or use it where they can observe it.
    o Never send your password by email or speak it where others may hear.
    o Occasionally verify your current password and change it to a new one.
    o Avoid writing your password down.  (Keep it with you in a purse
or wallet if you have to write down the password until you remember

ideally this would be coupled with a personal vascular scan biometric

excessive typing == unnecessary leaked information and longer auth
process (acoustic, profiling, easier pattern discovery, etc.)
i don't have a problem supporting a passphrase mode (>16 chars?  >32?)
but i'd rather not make it the default.
(and the default is and must be the most secure and usable path for
this to be trustworthy and widely usable)

very true.
it is my personal hunch that if users had just one password they
needed to remember they could remember a good one.  the janus stuff we
are working on uses loop-aes volumes specifically so you can store
passwords in a browser, store capability URL's, keep accounts and
logins in a text file, etc.
[i'd love to know of any studies to this end though.  i have tried
experiments to see just how much entropy i can commit to memory and it
is more than enough for a good interactive authentication.  i think
this is within the ability of most, if they had a desire to do so and
understood the benefit.]
so the goal is to provide a usable system with a single password, and
make it user centric, so that all the other credentials and secrets
associated with other digital identies can benefit from this bootstrap
(and presumably share this more secure bootstrap).

@_author: coderman

true; which is why i'd like to see them use a single good password to
mount an encrypted volume and secure OS where the rest of the
(different*) passwords and PIN's and whatever else are kept.
this is a handy utility!
i'd still be concerned about dictionary attacks on poor passwords
(that is, discovering '.848fe29s44j' is the hash for pwned.com and
'secret'.)  secure digests make this more expensive but not by much.
* are you aware of any utility for the browser that generates random
passwords?  i'd like something like this as well, with the idea that
the first time you visit the site (or need to change a password) a
random password is generated, placed in the input text field, and then
the browser password manager remembers it after that point.  (and the
password db is stored on an encrypted file system to prevent theft).
someone will ask about users who aren't on their machine and need to
access a site.  i don't like to support this ability because you
should never be using an untrusted computer to access a secure site. if the computer is trusted you should also be able to boot from CD and
insert your USB storage key (which lets you use your browser password
(actually, looking at the source for PwdHash it appears easy enough to
modify for random password generation)
thanks for the tip,

fine as long as trust and identity are properly implemented. physically hardened tokens are very good (ex: the rsa challenge / pin
based token authenticator via radius)
SPEKE and variants are also highly recommended in my book if you can
use them in a secure context (that is, no rootkits and equivalents to
capture passwords/phrases - a situation where single use passwords /
bingo auth are helpful if secure hardware tokens are not feasible)
this works very well, and if you have hardware accelerated encryption
it can be transparent.  you can also pre distribute keys (public and
secret) to the encrypted volumes you mount and run within (via a
secure bootstrap of course...)

i think this is a rich field of discovery when considering the user
interface and authentication / session aspects of a secure system.

look at using a quorum based key distribution and agreement protocol
(where quorum == a specific subset of group key management) with
regular attestation / rekeying via trusted and strongly authenticated
mechanisms.  session timeout (for failure / lack of consensus /
malicious attack) should be detected within an appropriate time frame
for the user to respond securely.  (i tend to think 60 seconds is an
acceptable window)
doing this in a user friendly manner is very difficult and probably

hi jinz,
i don't have time for a detailed reply but i thought a little more
info would be useful
i mentioned quorum systems and group key distribution to achieve a
shared and authenticated state among a group of peers that can be kept
in sync / coherent via frequent attestation (group re keying with
quorum consensus to distribute new keys).
there are many ways to implement this so i'll stick to conceptual
features / attributes and how this relates to a private group network
system we are implementing.
quorum authorities are those who sign all the other authorities keys
as part of the group key distribution.  quorum  or group members are
those who receive keys from one or more quorum authorities.
the quorum authorities maintain an index of all known / trusted group
members and the trust metrics assigned to the roles / services they
can perform.
and peer may solicit, provide and consume the services of another once
they verify they are trusted to do so.  they can contact any of the
quorum authorities (who have a full index and trust metric state /
graph) to certify the remote peer before doing so.
a group authorities may issue a revocation signed by his current group
identity key to disband the quorum / group.
if consensus cannot be reached within the next group re-key interval
(due to failure, lack of consensus at the meatspace / user level, or
malicious attack / DoS) the group must be re-keyed from the face to
face ground up and all reputation rebuilt.
the identifiers signed by the quorum during each iteration consist of:
- the key digests for each authority for the next group key exchange
- the sha-256 digest of the current base share file state image
(includes base OS and private group files/keys)
- the sha-256 digests of all delta based overlay filesystem images. these are optional among group members but mandatory for all quorum
upon this base you can build / tie to various group synchronization
mechanisms that are strongly authenticated and yet still fully
i hope that helps.

CUBAN SPY CASE
Feds bugged bedroom, phones of FIU pair
New court evidence in the Cuba spy case reveals the United States
used wiretaps for years before agents arrested an FIU professor and
his counselor wife.
BY JAY WEAVER
jweaver at MiamiHerald.com
Federal agents planted a bug in the bedroom of a Florida
International University a couple of years ago, netting evidence to
charge them as unregistered agents for the Cuban government,
according to court records.
The FBI also wiretapped the home phones of Professor Carlos Alvarez
and his counselor wife, Elsa Alvarez, from at least late 2001 until
last summer, collecting electronic evidence on practically all of
their conversations.
The reams of intercepts included mundane exchanges and even the
private musings between husband and wife.
The FBI's eavesdropping of the couple's home goes far beyond what was
first known about evidence in the case, which included alleged
''confessions'' to federal agents last summer and the confiscation of
the Alvarezes' home and FIU computers. The surveillance evidence
surfaced as part of their lawyers' efforts to revoke the couple's
detention before their scheduled May 8 trial.
It's unclear from the court record how these thousands and thousands
of surveillance intercepts will help the U.S. attorney's office
prosecute the couple, who are suspected of reporting on the exile
community and its leaders to Cuban leader Fidel Castro's government.
According to sources familiar with the case, the FBI had hoped the
electronic intercepts would provide leads on alleged spying activity
on behalf of the Cuban government. The evidence led only to the
Alvarezes' arrests in January. It's unclear why prosecutors chose to
charge them at that time.
The couple's lawyers say prosecutors have produced ''about 200
supposedly pertinent conversations'' recorded by the FBI, court
records show. The evidence remains sealed from the public. But the
Alvarezes' lawyers say the ''majority deals only with mundane
activities of daily life'' -- such as conversations about the
Alvarezes' dinner plans, the tenting of their South Miami home for
termites and meetings at their Catholic church.
THE DEFENSE STANCE
The couple's lawyers, Steven Chaykin and Jane Moscowitz, argue their
clients would not leave for Cuba if released because they have strong
ties to the community, including five children and elderly parents.
They are challenging whether the FBI lawfully obtained warrants to
conduct the electronic surveillance. The FBI obtained the warrants
under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the
government to wiretap people in the United States suspected of being
agents for a foreign government or involved in terrorist activity overseas.
In the war on terror, the Bush administration has attracted sharp
criticism for authorizing warrantless domestic wiretaps without
approval from the secretive FISA court -- an issue that doesn't apply
to the Alvarez case.
It is not clear from court records how long the FBI conducted
electronic surveillance of the couple's home. But it appears the FISA
wiretaps of the Alvarezes may have begun years before the Sept. 11,
2001, terrorist attacks. Post-9/11, Congress approved the USA Patriot
Act that allows federal agencies to use foreign intelligence wiretap
evidence for criminal investigations, such as the Alvarezes' case.
'On March 6, 2006, the government produced summaries of allegedly
`pertinent' recorded conversations produced by that surveillance
starting in December 2001 and ending July 4, 2005, although the
government states that the eavesdropping began earlier and continued
until the defendants' arrest on Jan. 6, 2006,'' the Alvarezes' lawyers wrote.
The attorneys, in their motion, asked the government to disclose the
documents related to the wiretap warrants. They are trying to
challenge evidence that could affect their clients' case before a jury.
They cited constitutional protections for Carlos Alvarez, 61, a
psychology professor, and his wife, Elsa, 55, a psychology counselor,
both U.S. citizens.
Referring to the FISA law, the attorneys said: No U.S. citizen ``may
be considered an agent of a foreign power solely upon the basis of
activities that are protected by the First Amendment. . . .''
For example, they argued, more than 40 of the ''pertinent'' FISA
recordings are telephone conversations between Carlos Alvarez and an
unidentified colleague regarding legally licensed culture-exchange
programs between the United States and Cuba.

This month, federal prosecutors refused to turn over documents for
the FISA warrants to the Alvarezes' attorneys.
So far, U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore has issued a protective
order that allows only members of the legal teams and their staffs to
review the declassified FISA intercepts for the upcoming trial.
Prosecutors apparently disclosed evidence about the FISA wiretaps to
show the judge that the Alvarezes are a ``serious risk of flight.''
Assistant U.S. attorney Brian Frazier cited Magistrate Judge Andrea
Simonton's January ruling in which she said the couple would receive
''a hero's welcome'' in Cuba.
The prosecutor said the couple used their cover at FIU to infiltrate
the exile community, spying on the university's president, Mitch
Maidique, and other exile leaders. He said they secretly communicated
with the Cuban intelligence directorate, using five-digit code in
short-wave radio transmissions.
Once the messages were received, they would input them into their
home computer, equipped with decryption technology.
Prosecutors say the couple traveled to Cuba, Mexico and other
countries to exchange information with their handlers from the Cuban
Directorate of Intelligence.
According to court filings, the Alvarezes reported on ''community
attitudes'' after the FBI's 1998 arrests of 10 Cubans charged with
spying. That high-profile espionage case was linked to the Cuban
government's shoot-down of two Brothers to the Rescue exile planes
over the Florida Straits that killed four Miami men two years earlier.

@_subject: cypherpunks write girl code? :) 
Do engineers and programmers care about concepts like beauty and
elegance? Should they? Designers have always known that looks
matter--that the outside (interface) matters. But deep in the heart of
those building the inside--the technology most users never see--lies
the sensibility of an artist. In a kind of "Design Eye for the Code
Guy" way.
While I'm stereotyping with abandon, I might as well be honest. I've
been going to tech conferences for the last 15 years, and I swear the
ratio of pocket protectors to Urban Outfitter clothes has shifted
dramatically. So maybe it's not accurate to say geeks today are better
looking--but they're certainly better dressed. With hipper haircuts.
Does this /mean/ anything? Maybe.
What prompted this post--and it's whimsical title--is a post by Jamis
Buck titled Beautiful code, test first, which includes the following:
"He was telling me how he feels like he has to sit and tweak his code
over and over until it not only acts right, but looks right. It cannot
be merely functional, it must be beautiful, as well."
But the best part was a comment by "Morten" that included the line:
"As for spending too much time on making the code look right down to
the last indentation - my code has been called "girl code" for the
same reason..."
And there you have it. I think "girl code" is quite a compliment.
Because caring about things like beauty makes us better programmers
and engineers. We make better things. Things that aren't just
functional, but easy to read, elegantly maintainable, easier--and more
joyful--to use, and sometimes flat-out sexy. And whether we like it or
not, most of the world associates an appreciation for beauty more with
women than men (especially geek men). Women may have a genetic
advantage here.
A passion for aesthetics can mean the difference between code that
others enjoy working on vs. code that's stressful to look at.
Yes, calling beautiful code "girl code" is both silly and some might
believe sexist. But that doesn't mean there isn't some truth to it. As
a female technologist in a heavily male-skewed industry, I don't need
you to compliment my hair. But if you tell me my code is pretty, I
might give you some tips.
And if it makes you feel better, I'll refer to YOUR gorgeous code as
metrosexual. But we'll both know the truth.

a very detailed paper on group key agreement for ad-hoc networks:
Abstract. Over the last 30 years the study of group key agreement has
stimulated much work. And as a result of the increased popularity of
ad hoc networks, some approaches for the group key establishment in
such networks are proposed. However, they are either only for static
group or the memory, computation and communication costs are
unacceptable for ad-hoc networks. In this thesis some protocol suites
from the literature (2^d-cube, 2^d-octopus, Asokan-Ginzboorg, CLIQUES,
STR and TGDH) shall be discussed. We have optimized STR and TGDH by
reducing the memory, communication and computation costs. The
optimized version are denoted by 5STR and 5TGDH respectively. Based on
the protocol suites 5STR and 5TGDH we present a Tree-based group key
agreement Framework for Ad-hoc Networks (TFAN). TFAN is especially
suitable for ad-hoc networks with limited bandwidth and devices with
limited memory and computation capability. To simulate the protocols,
we have implemented TFAN, 5STR and 5TGDH with J2ME CDC. The TFAN API
will be described in this thesis.

Spies Use Shortwave Broadcasts
In January, a Florida couple was accused of operating as covert agents

"UTILITY WORLD
HF COMMUNICATIONS
Cuban 'Numbers': A Pattern Emerges
By: Hugh Stegman, NV6H
hugh stegman at monitoring times.com
   Collection and analysis of several months' loggings confirms that,
just as others have observed, the Cuban voice 'numbers' station does
indeed have what may be its first daily broadcast schedule ever.
  This station is also known as 'V2,' 'Attention' (from its callup),
the 5-Figure Spanish Lady, and the 'SS/YL/5F' (same thing in
shortwavese'). Its the latest version of the famous Cuban spy
transmissions which have mystified listeners in much of the world,
while inspiring some good pop music, for several decades now.
  And indeed, these broadcasts are compelling in their sheer
strangeness. Mumbling voices, strange noises, Radio Havana, and even
the occasional parrot, can turn up on the open tuning carriers run
before the messages. Technical flubs, mostly of the 'oops, wrong
button' variety, are many and legendary. If everything works (always a
big "if" with this bunch), that ominous machine-spliced female finally
barks the distinctive 'Atencion' ('Attention').
   While the name 'V2' sounds appropriately like some kind of World
War II German rocket bomb, it is simply the sequential designator
given this particular broadcast on the list maintained by ENIGMA2000.
They're the online incarnation of the European Numbers Intelligence
Gathering and Monitoring Association. Over the years, this generic V2
has had a number of lettered variants. These differ in message
structure or detailed formatting.
   After the callup, our V2a variant sends a message designator with
three 5-number groups. These are the first groups in the three
following messages, which are of equal length. Each message is always
150 5-number groups, beginning (as we've noted) with the one in the
designator. The whole transmission usually ends with the Spanish
'final'  ('end'), around 45 minutes after the hour.
  While the Cubans have traditionally preferred monthly and weekly
schedules, the new local-daytime V2a is a daily one. It's a long
schedule by 'numbers' standards. It's more  like something you'd hear
from an international broadcaster, changing frequency more of less
hourly while maintaining a long program. This is pretty ambitious for
an operation which is so audibly straining to keep its aging,
hurricane-damaged equipment going.
  The daily schedule starts at 1600 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC),
and goes until the 2100 broadcasts ends, nearly six hours later. The
times in UTC and frequencies in kilohertz (kHz, AM mode) are:
       1600 on 7975.0
       1700 on 8010.0
       1800 on 8097.0
       1900 on 8097.0
       2000 on 7887.0
       2100 on 6855.0
   That's it. By the standards of 'numbers' stations, which often
confront listeners with a bewildering number of times and frequencies,
this is pretty simple stuff.
   But there is way more: All of the other V2 schedules are still on
the air. These are the more traditional ones, using what may or may
not be a weekly frequency rotation. Parallel transmissions frequently
occur, on two or three frequencies.
   At press time, the rest of V2a was on from as early as 0200 UTC
until as late as 1500. In other words, there's a Cuban voice 'spy
numbers' station  going somewhere at nearly any hour of the day. This
doesn't even count the hours of Morse code broadcasts in a similar
format. For whatever its worth, which may not be much, this represents
an awesome volume of traffic.
  V2a Message Continuity
  These transmissions have another most interesting feature. If one
logs all of the initial three-group message designators, it becomes
quickly evident that they are anyting but random. In fact, they ofter
increment their last figures by one with each day's broadcast.
   The best way to explain this is by example. On December 11, 2005,
one of several sets of message designators was 38641  45851  51761. On
the 12th, this one changed to 38642 45852 71762, but the messages
stayed the same. On the 13th, it became 38643  45853  51763. This
continued until the last digits reached 6 on the 16th.
   At the same time, another sequence started out as 55911  12911 31311 (they always seem to start out ending in 1). This one did the
same behavior, until reaching 5 on the 15th. Currently, in early
January, we have 51871  10971  04481, incrementing daily.
  It's been theorized that this last digit refers to the number of
times a message has been broadcast. In any event, it's a real good
idea to keep track of these numbers when logging the Cuban stations.
   As special word of thanks is due to Camilo Castillo, a dedicated
ham and numbers listener in Panama, for making most of the loggings
used in the data. A few others appeared on the usual Internet mailing
lists, and the showed the same patterns we describe."
 THE artilce also shows what they claim is a "Typical code pad used
with 'numbers' broadcasts." It is a small booklike pad about the same
size as the match box used for the small wood or kitchen type matches
( 2" x 1" x .5") with six  columns of numbers printed on both sides of
the page.

@_subject: keys and cards and user interaction 
comments?  suggestions?
"keys" store password/passphrase protected volumes with cryptographic
keys, certs, and other credentials associated with digital identities.
"cards" are read only volumes with the public keys and public
identifiers associated with digital identities.
it is very important that they not be confused, and that "keys" are
only used on a trusted system.
"keys" are the only volume which will ever prompt for a
password/passphrase to open them.  if you are asked for a password it
should only be on a system you trust and as expected when using or
managing your keys.  keys are stored on an XFS filesystem on USB or
other media (USB by default) which contains the encrypted key store. this scales well (multi-gig USB volumes) and uses existing crypted
file system support to implement privacy.  Any number of other volumes
(for example hdd installed OS'es) can be tied to this "keys" volume by
storing the AES keys and disk identifiers associated with that volume
inside the "keys" protected volume.
the only boot targets which may use private "keys" are:
 - the "keys" secure key management mode.
  - the "install" mode to create new loop-aes keys and install OS on
this trusted system.
  - the "hdd" mode to boot an encrypted OS installation on a trusted system.
the other boot targets should only reference public "cards" and will
never prompt for authentication at boot or during operation.
"cards" are ISO9660 filesystems that can be stored on a public USB
memory stick or burned to mini-CDR / DVD-R, etc.  "cards" are public,
and can be copied freely and will never ask for authentication.
the "keys" authorized modes thus explicitly mount a USB volume as XFS
when a "keys" volume is expected.  the key mgmt mode will explicitly
mount as iso9660 when a "cards" volume is expected.  thus a confused
user could not accidentally write secret "keys" data to a public
"cards" volume, and vice versa.
this also allows the key management mode to determine what kind of
volume is present as indicated by the file system type. (the secure
key management mode is the only mode where public "cards" can be
imported to your secret "keys".  the hdd and install modes will never
prompt for a public card.  note that the "live" boot mode may use
"cards" to connect to remote services securely.)
"keys" storage:
[XFS volume ...
   (petname for this volume)
   (public GUID / nonce)
   (GPG or loop-aes encrypted file)
.../coderman/  (petname)
.../coderman/id.txt   (512 byte GUID / nonce in hex)
.../coderman/keys.dat   (encrypted key store, gpg or loop-aes)
coderman might be a social context while mpeck is a professional context.
"cards" storage:
[ ISO9660 volume ...
  (sha512 hash of identity public key)
  (identity public key)
  (nickname or alias for identified entity)
  (additional volumes or metadata)
  (signatures for nicknames and other metadata)
.../1496b640690342ed/  (hex digits of first 8 bytes of sha512 digest
of public.key)
.../1496b640690342ed/digest.txt  (full hex digits of sha512 digest of
.../1496b640690342ed/nickname.txt  ("coderman's public weblog")
.../1496b640690342ed/aaaaaa.dat   (arbitrary metadata - an image? etc)

some corrections / clarification:
note that within a graphical environment you may be prompted for
passwords or authentication unrelated to the root/core identities
which are stored in the "keys" volume(s).
within the janus wireless software all password/passphrase management
for root/core identities (the "keys" volume(s)) occurs at a text
console and usually during boot.
facilities are in place to prevent you from needing passwords in other
contexts although this cannot cover every possibility.
(that is to say, within janus we encourage the use of certificates and
signatures for authentication and captcha/PINs for liveness detection.
 the identity management provided by janus wireless software is
intended to make these keys/certificates easy to create, distribute,
manage and revoke in any external domains where they are used.)
this console mode only password use is done to prevent UI attacks
(phishing, spoofing, etc) and text console provides a good way to
avoid these.
the secure key management mode can import and export keys and cards
and supports a wide variety of filesystems to do so.  key backup (if
used, please do) occurs in this domain and may consist of saving the
password protected volume to multiple USB keys, compact flash drives,
hard disks, or burned to CD/DVD media.  you can use a different
password/passphrase for these backup volumes.  (for example, a random
256bit key written on a card stored in a safe)
the other "keys" authorized modes simply consume/use existing keys.
the "live" and internet connected modes are ephemeral, and thus only
use public "cards" when pubkeys/certificates are required to access
resources.  if replay / MITM is a concern the public keys used should
be one time only.
that should read: 512 _bit_ GUID or nonce in hex string.
a social and professional context are the two types provided by
default.  the number of contexts supported is limited only by storage
space on the "keys" volume and your ability to assign distinct pet
names to each.

@_subject: janus wireless faq 
- why "wireless"?
we believe that wireless is the most robust form of communication when
implemented properly*.  we also believe that any communication between
secure domains should be considered public and open to active
attackers (like wireless is).
for this reason strong privacy and authentication must always be used
for secure network communication.
a proper wireless implementation can transmit datagrams in an
injection style manner and receive any datagrams in a monitor style
manner.  all packets received must be authenticated before passing up
to higher level (IP/etc) stacks. all unauthenticated packets must be
dropped silently.  the rate of transmit should be as low as possible
while still retaining sufficient communication bandwidth.  the rate of
transmit should also be considerate to the needs of others who can
hear your transmission and may defer theirs accordingly.  deference
should not open up denial of service vulnerabilities but is encouraged
when possible to provide a cooperative multi-network with sufficient
bandwidth for all.
[the technical complexity of this is high and we are being
intentionally vague at this point until further refinements are in
place and this can be described in detail via working implementation
on atheros / prism2 hardware that does not DoS other wireless
technologies.  802.11 is a good example of an improper implementation
that is trivial to DoS via spoofed packets at the MAC layer
(deauth/disassoc injection).]

ah, reputation and trust.  my favorite crux
---------- Forwarded message ----------
I am living in France and working for some French security agency.
Please understand that I may not identify myself. Working for a
security agency does not mean that I approve all their actions, even
those that I MUST do.
Since about 5 years, French services are trying to control the
"anonymous" French based services. It includes TOR, and some
About 4 years ago (I don't remember exactly, and I am at home now, I
haven't my documents with me), we visited the operator of the
remailers FROG and AZERTY. We suspected him to be also the webmaster
of the website CAMELEON, but it is another story.
We seized his computers, disks of course, etc, and arrested the man.
Then we told him "You have a choice between 2 options: You accept to
work for us, it means concretely to give us your remailers' keys and
to forward the remailer emails to us, or you will go to prison for
threat against the national security. Just a few months, the time we
check all your computers, make an audit on your disks, etc".
After 30 minutes, the guy gave us his remailers' keys, and accepted
our offer. He then re-installed his remailers, and all the traffic was
sent to us too. I remember that we asked him to NOT send us the
garbage that the remailers automatically send! Then our computers
processed the messages, using the remailers' keys. Of course we could
not decypher all, if Frog/Azerty was :"in the middle" we couldn't do
anything. But when these remailers where the first or the last one, it
was very very interesting...
I don't know now if these remailers are still operated, I am working
in another service.
About TOR now: I MAY not say all what I know, as the case is currently
investigated by our services and I don't want to get into trouble!
Just know that France's policy is to NOT allow ANY remailer or
anonymous service run from France, UNLESS the French special services
can control it. This is a NO exception rule.
The only recommendations that I can do to the TOR users, is to NOT use
any French-based TOR servers in entry ou exit.
People here and there are generally against the US gov and say that he
"violates their rights". I don't know a lot about the US gov. But what
I know about the French gov, and the instructions our services receive
a few times by week, make me sure that the French citizens' rights are
perpetually violated, about phone tapping and internet.

@_subject: Fwd: Some legal trouble with TOR in France 
i suppose my point was that trusting tor as it stands is a leap of
faith.  there is little visibility as far as node selection criteria
for addition to the directory, the information and physical security
aspects of the servers within the directory, and the reputation of the
node operators with respect to "rubber hose / threatened
incarceration" attacks and the associated trust level to assign in
such a context.
much better than nothing, but i still consider tor useful mainly for
keeping your source IP out of webserver logs.  any other government /
malicious entity can compromise accordingly.  (i know this isn't the
situation overall, but i assume as much so i won't be surprised by a
worst case)
i used to run a peertech node on a dedicated server.  this host was
compromised by tech staff at the facility with physical access and
ever since i've refused to operate a node until i could be sure
physical security was assured.
i tend to consider any service that relies on host integrity also
reliant on a number of other prerequisites like:
- physical security to prevent unauthorized access
- hard disk encryption to prevent unauthenticated disclosure (esp.
seizure of hardware)
- infosec best practices to keep attack surface minimal (firewalls,
chroot, VM's, POLA, etc)
for the situation mentioned in parent thread, i'd like to know that if
the TLA comes knockin' my key scrubbing loop-aes turns all disks into
large entropy stores the moment power is killed upon any attempted
most services currently assume the disk is private.  if you want a
private disk, you need full disk encryption (key scrubbing in RAM++)
tied to strong authentication.

i'm anxiously awaiting some more technical detail on all these black
programs so heavily compartmentalized beyond accountability.
this is my favorite Russ Tice quote:
"there's no way the programs I want to talk to Congress about should
be public ever, unless maybe in 200 years they want to declassify
them. You should never learn about it; no one at the Times should ever
learn about these things. But that same mechanism that allows you to
have a program like this at an extremely high, sensitive
classification level could also be used to mask illegality, like
spying on Americans." [1]
Arkin says that all these activities revolve around two key questions:
are these just "ingestion and digestion" designed to catch more
terrorists, or are they the "the building blocks of a new seamless
surveillance culture?"
""We should be terrified that Congress has not been doing its job and
because all of the checks and balances put in place to prevent this
have been deliberately obviated. In order to get this done, the NSA
and White House went around all of the checks and balances. I'm
convinced that 20 years from now we, as historians, will be looking
back at this as one of the darkest eras in American history. And we're
just beginning to sort of peel back the first layers of the onion.
We're hoping against hope that it's not as bad as I suspect it will
be, but reality sets in every time a new article is published and the
first thing the Bush administration tries to do is quash the story.
It's like the lawsuit brought by [the Electronic Frontier Foundation]
against AT&T  the government's first reaction was to try to quash the
lawsuit. That ought to be a warning sign that they're on to
something."" - Matthew Aid
Meanwhile, National Journal's CongressDaily reported last week that

unlawful, but that what has been disclosed so far is only the tip of
the iceberg."

heard about yet," he said. ... He would not discuss with a reporter
the details of his allegations, saying doing so would compromise
classified information and put him at risk of going to jail. He said
he "will not confirm or deny" if his allegations involve the illegal
use of space systems and satellites.  '

the Narus Insight can troll 10GigE/OC-192 links at L4 and OC-48 at L7.
 this might explain why the circuits top out at OC-48 into the tap

@_subject: Judge denies AT&T request for closed hearing 
wow, perhaps the attempted DoJ dismissal is going to get rejected as well...
A federal judge rejected a request from AT&T on Wednesday to kick the
public out of a hearing in a lawsuit alleging the telecommunications
company illegally cooperated with the National Security Agency.
AT&T had asked U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker to bar everyone but
attorneys from the courtroom, arguing that trade secrets about the
inner workings of its network could be divulged.
"We have intellectual property rights in that information," said David
Anderson, an attorney at Pillsbury Winthrop who is representing AT&T.
"We submit that the hearing itself be held 'in camera,'" a legal term
meaning in private.
But Walker rejected the request, saying that carefully dealing with
questions about trade secrets in an open courtroom "is not
CNET Networks (publisher of CNET News.com), Wired News and the
California First Amendment Coalition sent an attorney to the hearing
on Wednesday to argue that the public should not be prevented from
attending the proceedings. A letter written by Roger Myers at Holme,
Roberts & Owen submitted early in the day said the hearing should
remain open because "the surveillance at the heart of the case
presents issues of enormous public interest and importance."
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group in San
Francisco, filed the class action lawsuit in January that claims AT&T
illegally cooperated with the Bush administration's secret
eavesdropping program. EFF has obtained documents from a former AT&T
employee that it believes buttresses its case, but which the
telecommunications company says contain trade secrets and proprietary
business information.
Both sides have been quarreling over what to do with the documents
provided by former AT&T technician Mark Klein and filed under seal
with the court, with EFF saying they should be made entirely public
and AT&T arguing they should be returned because they contain
confidential information.
Walker on Wednesday effectively split the difference, saying that he
would maintain the current state of affairs for now. He also ordered
EFF's attorneys not to "disclose these documents to any party," and
rejected AT&T's request that Klein be muzzled, saying the company
could sue him directly if it chose.
Based on the information that's been made public so far, the 100 pages
or so of information in Klein's documents appear to describe a secret
room established in AT&T's main switching centers through which a
tremendous amount of Internet and voice traffic flows. Those secret
rooms, according to Klein's attorney, give the NSA full access to the
company's networks and can be found in switching centers in San
Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and San Jose, Calif.

i'd love to know how much manpower is assigned to defining and tuning
these filters.  this is a difficult process to be sure.
the SunFire V880 is the Narus controller according to the docs and i
bet the filter updates are pretty frequent.  they might even use an
IPsec VPN over the backhaul fiber via the cisco/juniper switches
indeed.  and the StorEdge T3 could cache quite a bit during peak
activity to fill up idle periods later at night.  (oh crap, i hope we
aren't giving them ideas!  ;)
yes.  it keeps that layer 7 inspection guessing past layer 4.  a
large, reputable zero knowledge mix is what would be ideal, though the
latency induced makes certain services impossible or unfriendly.
i love to promote out of band distribution any chance i get, including
sneaker net with DVD-R's and local wireless networks between peers.
but you really need a zero knowledge configuration to be sure.
i have faith in well designed hardware entropy sources and AES-256 in
hardware when frequently rekeyed.  pubkey crypto makes me nervous
(long term) but will always be useful.
i have much less faith in the systems around these crypto primitives,
be it operating systems or protocols down to physical security and
side channels.  i bet the black bag jobs are almost always 100%
100,000,000 peers running a zero knowledge mix off their broadband
connection.  i don't think stego would be effective; if there was an
unbreakable stego system the overhead would be significant.  (there
was a design a fellow at DC13 described using inodes on valid file
systems for storage, but this doesn't give you much space compared to
the physical storage capacity used overall)
but lots of crypto everywhere would certainly help make the presence
of encryption alone less interesting.  (as has been rumored on this
list and elsewhere that merely using encryption makes you interesting)

hmm, i recall amusing conversations about honey tokens and baiting TLA's.
true, this is probably how it is done.
would IPsec or some NSA built auth & privacy at layer 2 be more likely?
consider this vicious rumor but a little birdie informed me that
physical security at these locations is well covered.  strategically
placed cages, reinforced and locked, armed guards. all this on top of
the usually very tight security at these facilities. (though it
sounded like the guards were a recent introduction.  someone getting
nervous about legitimate employees poking around?)
so in this case i think there is probably useful data on the disks
(the filters and controlling software for the narus / other
equipment), caching might be implemented (the T3's on fibre channel
have some nice throughput, although this configuration is years old at
this point), and i very much doubt any destructive countermeasures.
network file systems introduce reliability concerns.  intermittent
link outages would mean a bit of caching in the local case, but might
cause monitoring / capture failure in a network file system scenario.
maybe we'll find out in the near future. :)

i was thinking three scenarios:
1. backhaul is a dedicated link (SONET?*) with encryption at this
layer and control/management out of band.
2. backhaul and control/mgmt on the dedicated link (SONET?*) with
encryption at this layer, no IPsec.
3. backhaul and control/mgmt on the dedicated link using IPsec for
both. (least likely perhaps)
the nature of SONET would make encryption at this layer tricky i think
(L2/L3?) although the NSA is fond of authentication and privacy at the
link layer.  if a desire to leverage commercial solutions (narus,
cisco, juniper, etc) won out would a strongly keyed IPsec be
sufficient?  no ISAKMP/IKE here, heh.
covert channels for backhaul?  nah, that would still be too visible.
especially if/when a customer puts link testing equipment on the line
and sees something funny. SONET doesn't give you a lot of play room.
not for this.  capturing SS7 would be useful and is surely performed though...
why not?  most of these SONET/[D]WDM links are long haul anyway.  it's
not a single repeated fiber, but hops along backbone peering points
like everything else.
also casts an interesting light on the new super NSA warehouse planned
for Denver, CO doesn't it.  nice place to position tap aggregation...
AT&T, Verizon and Sprint for sure.  probably lease fiber (through some
obfuscated shell company / other agency configuration?) from all of
them to some degree, including the transoceanic cable oligopolies.
one way to find out:
- perform your own non-interruptive tap on the fibers exiting $telco
via infiltration of outside plant conduit.  (so easy, lol)
- using test equipment see what SONET link(s) are full of blackened
traffic. you could use AS no's or BGP/SS7 characteristics to identify
legitimate circuits and highlight the blackened ones via elimination.
- ask Sean Gorman or GeoTEL MetroFiber which provider sold out that
particular circuit/fiber/route.
something tells me this is beyond the means of your average hacker.
FOIA requests it is then...  *grin*
for the record: i'm not advocating illegal intrusions; this is a
mental exercise. :)
[ i'm not too paranoid about visits from MIB's but mapping critical
information infrastructure is definitely one way to attract attention.
 maybe i'll talk more about that later... ]

  >>>>Second, I'm thinking that there's a problem here regarding
consistency.  If I have a material expenditure or liability (or, I suppose,
revenue or income or investment) that may appropriately be kept secret
under Section 78m(b)(3), then doesn't it follow logically that I will also
exclude it from the financials I file with my 10Ks and 8Ks, etc.?
Otherwise there will be a material mismatch between two publicly filed

  >>-The exemption covers those documents too.  Section 78m(b)(3) excuses

I should have made that more clear.  Most all of the '34 Act (which covers

the authority for most of those rules.<<
  So: Bottom line: If AT&T (or Verizon) got paid $1 billion from the spooks
to do something, but got the right directive, they could simply not
disclose that revenue on any SEC filing.  Or, if they did something that
exposed them to liability -- like violating relevant customer privacy
requirements, and their normal obligation would be to disclose the
liability and make a reserve for it, they just don't have to.
  If that's right, at the moment it seems to me that the shareholders of
those companies are awfully exposed, aren't they....?

@_subject: Legal loophole emerges in NSA spy program 
this administration is particularly skilled at legal exploit.  pehaps
all that practice bending tax law over a barrel was merely warm up.
remember that Ashcroft was indeed signing approvals (in fact, they
pestered him at the hospital while he was still recovering from
surgery) and the deputy attorney general was also involved (i don't
remember if he provided authorization when Ashcroft was
incapacitated/reluctant or not...)
By Declan McCullagh
Story last modified Wed May 17 20:08:38 PDT 2006
SAN FRANCISCO--An AT&T attorney indicated in federal court on
Wednesday that the Bush administration may have provided legal
authorization for the telecommunications company to open its network
to the National Security Agency.
Federal law may "authorize and in some cases require
telecommunications companies to furnish information" to the executive
branch, said Bradford Berenson, who was associate White House counsel
when President Bush authorized the NSA surveillance program in late
2001 and is now a partner at the Sidley Austin law firm in Washington,
Bradford Berenson Bradford Berenson
Far from being complicit in an illegal spying scheme, Berenson said,
"AT&T is essentially an innocent bystander."
AT&T may be referring to an obscure section of federal law, 18 U.S.C.
2511, which permits a telecommunications company to provide
"information" and "facilities" to the federal government as long as
the attorney general authorizes it. The authorization must come in the
form of "certification in writing by...the Attorney General of the
United States that no warrant or court order is required by law."
Information that is not yet public "would be exculpatory and would
show AT&T's conduct in the best possible light," Berenson said. But he
did not acknowledge any details about the company's alleged
participation in the NSA's surveillance program, which has ignited an
ongoing debate on Capitol Hill and led to this class-action lawsuit
being filed in January by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
Some legal experts say that AT&T may be off the hook if former
Attorney General John Ashcroft, who was in office at the time the NSA
program began, provided a letter of certification. (Other officials,
including the deputy attorney general and state attorneys general,
also are authorized to write these letters.)
"If the certification exists, AT&T is in pretty good shape," said Marc
Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center and co-author of a book on information privacy law.
EFF's lawsuit alleges that the telecommunications company let the NSA
engage in wholesale monitoring of Americans' communications in
violation of privacy laws. Confidential documents that EFF unearthed
during the course of the suit--kept under seal and still not
public--allege that AT&T gave the government full access to its
networks in a way that let millions of e-mail messages, Web browsing
sessions and phone calls be intercepted.
AT&T's ace in the hole?
If a letter of certification exists, AT&T could have an ace in the
hole. A second section of federal law says that a "good faith"
reliance on a letter of certification "is a complete defense to any
civil or criminal" lawsuit.
During the hearing Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker,
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Carl Nichols also hinted that such a
letter exists. Nichols said that there are undisclosed "facts that
AT&T might want to present in its defense."
""" AT&T's legal defense?
An obscure section of federal law says that AT&T may have legally
participated in the NSA surveillance program -- if, that is, it
received a "certification" from the attorney general.
That section says: "Notwithstanding any other law, providers of wire
or electronic communication service... are authorized to provide
information, facilities, or technical assistance to persons authorized
by law to intercept wire, oral, or electronic communications... if
such provider... has been provided with... a certification in writing
by... the Attorney General of the United States that no warrant or
court order is required by law, that all statutory requirements have
been met, and that the specified assistance is required, setting forth
the period of time during which the provision... is authorized... No
provider of wire or electronic communication... shall disclose the
existence of any interception or surveillance or the device used to
accomplish the interception or surveillance..."
But, Nichols added, those facts relate to classified information that
are "state secrets" and would jeopardize national security if they
were disclosed. A hearing on the Bush administration's request to
dismiss the case on national security grounds has been scheduled for
June 23.
For its part, AT&T has remained silent about the extent of its alleged
participation in the NSA surveillance scheme, which initially was
thought to apply only to international calls but now may encompass
records of domestic phone calls and more. Verizon and BellSouth, for
instance, took steps to distance themselves from a USA Today report
that said their call databases were opened to the NSA. But AT&T
wouldn't comment.
Marc Bien, a spokesman for AT&T, told CNET News.com on Wednesday:
"Without commenting on or confirming the existence of the program, we
can say that when the government asks for our help in protecting
national security, and the request is within the law, we will provide
that assistance."
The next tussle in this lawsuit is likely to center on how far the
"state secrets" concept can extend. Is AT&T able to divulge the text
of any certification letter, without saying exactly what information
it turned over as a result? Must the mere existence of a certification
letter remain secret?
Injecting additional complexity is 18 U.S.C. 2511's prohibition on
disclosure. It says that telecommunication companies may not "disclose
the existence of any interception or surveillance or the device used
to accomplish the interception or surveillance"--except if required by
law. Unlawful disclosures are subject to fines.
EFF claims that the existence of a letter of certification should not
be classified. Cindy Cohn, an EFF attorney, told the judge on
Wednesday that it is "not a state secret because the statute has a
whole process" governing it.
"If you have a certification, let's see it," EFF attorney Lee Tien
said in an interview after the hearing.
For his part, Berenson, the former attorney for President Bush who's
now representing AT&T, complained about allegations that his client is
violating the law. It's unfortunate that EFF "chose to use words like
'criminal tendency' and 'crimes,'" Berenson said. AT&T "is one of the
great companies of the United States. To attach those kinds of labels
is reckless at best."
Berenson's biography says he worked for Bush on the "war on terrorism"
and the USA Patriot Act. Since leaving the White House, Berenson has
written letters to Congress (click here for PDF) calling for renewal
of the Patriot Act and has co-founded a group called Citizens for the
Common Defence that advocates a "robust" view of presidential
authority. It filed, for instance, an amicus brief (click here for
PDF) before the Supreme Court in the Hamdi case arguing that a U.S.
citizen could be detained indefinitely without trial because of the
war on terror.

i like the speed of pre-shared keys assuming key mgmt is secure and
rekeying frequent (e.g. scheduled PSK's or one time pad based
ephemeral key exchange).
but anything using ephemeral keys needs to destroy them properly and
this is more robust  with DH (each end responsible for their
respective key destruction) than shared secrets (both ends must
destroy secrets) in addition to the fact that shared secrets are
usually much longer lived as well.
i do it all the time with openvpn, https, etc.  in theory anything
that supports SSLv3/TLSv1 should support a strong ephemeral DH cipher
suite.  as for particular sites and servers, i'd be interested to know
just what the usual distribution of utilized cipher suites is.  RSA
without DHE probably is the most common.
in most cases generating dh parameters and explicitly requiring a DHE
suite is the hardest part of any custom configuration needed.  the
session setup costs are a little higher but anyone doing SSL/TLS in
bulk probably has the necessary hardware acceleration in place
as a side note, i'd really like SHA2-256/512 to be added to SSL/TLS
and widely implemented.  AES256 with SHA1 digest is just a little
funny these days...

Roberts jumped in, defensively. "I am independent and I asked very
tough questions," he reported. He paused to check with his staff, then
added that oversight was "very independent."
Hayden's written statement said "UNCLASSIFIED" on each page, though it
could have been labeled "UNINTERESTING" because little more than a
collection of acronyms survived the declassification process.
"As director of NSA, I was the national SIGINT manager," he said. "I

and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And
the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life
can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has
poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has
goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed,
but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left
us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard

we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and
gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will
be lost....

makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear
me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the
passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human
progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power
they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as
men die, liberty will never perish. .....

are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love
of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate -
the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery!
Fight for liberty! In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: "the
Kingdom of God is within man" - not one man nor a group of men, but in
all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create
machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the
power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a
wonderful adventure. Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that
power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent
world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a
future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes
have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise.
They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the

"It's not just about who calls who. The NSA phone-monitoring project
looks at how terrorists place their calls  and then applies that
model to everyone, to see who else might be a suspect. It's a form of
predictive data mining made famous by the notorious Total Information
Awareness project...
Today, we learn why everyone's calls had to be in the target set. The
NSA wasn't just conducting social network analysis. It was using a
more controversial data mining technique, dragged into the popular
imagination by Darpa's Total Information Awareness project, which
focuses on prediction, not connections.
Under this approach, sophisticated algorithms hunt for patterns of
terrorist behavior in information-trails, and then apply those
patterns to average citizens, seeing which ones fit. It doesn't matter
who you know. It's what you do that gets you in trouble. If you spend
money and buy plane tickets like Mohammed Atta did, then maybe you're
a terrorist, too. Same goes for the kind, and frequency, of phone
calls you make."

- http traffic is identified by outgoing port (80, 8080, etc) rather
than traffic type. L7 matching is also in the works.
- https (SSL/TLS) traffic is passed through and not proxied.
- this runtime has not been hardened against malicious peers on the

we're trying to work out logistics for torrent seeding before
distributing the build tools to remaster your own vmware installers
and customize the privacy appliance.  we're working on fixing known
issues and anticipate a
how it works in a nutshell:
- start the vmware instance with 128M ram and 200M disk (image is 38M
- a public SMB share is provided with a Run.BAT install script
- script installs a MS PPTP VPN connection to forward all traffic
through the appliance
- privacy (privoxy) and anonymity (tor) is enabled by default.  you
can select privacy only for a faster browsing experience with ads and
popups filtered.
a note on auto updates:
remove the /etc/janus directory to prevent the automatic update check.
 we intend to use this to deploy security critical patches, filtering
updates to privoxy, and other maintenance.  you can apply these
changes by hand or disable them completely as desired.

nah, that only means the masses won't be coding their own anonymity
and privacy systems, which is a good thing (the masses would fuck it
up with impressive ROT13  style).
this also means that the developers who can scratch this itch (a
usable, secure, and windows application) are going to be fewer and far
between.  don't fret, it only takes one to code it and then all your
seething masses can steep themselves in the hedonistic pleasures of
anonymity and privacy in their familiar environments.
and last but not least, regarding RAH's virtuous invitation to sling a
little logic yourself:
bitching on a mailing list about the platform specific deficiencies of
anonymity/privacy software is not likely to conjure up one of these
"usable, secure, windows capable" developers anxious to pleasure your
impatient expectations of convenience.  teaching yourself how to build
secure privacy systems [0][1] so you can meet these wants with your
own effort is more likely to result in the outcome you seek.
with that colorful retort out of the way, you are absolutely correct
about the usability and integration aspects of a given system
affecting penetration in target user base and the actual security
provided [2].
as was mentioned earlier, a virtual machine to host a well tested,
robust installation of unix'y network intensive applications on
windows is a compromise that often keeps both parties happy.  there
really is no good answer if you have to rely on the windows TCP stack
under load, especially for non server flavors of windows (that is,
even overlapped i/o will run into problems: about ~4,000 sockets last
time i tested on xp pro).
we used this virtual machine approach in janusvm [3], and tried to
focus on good usability via two methods:
a.) trimming the install process down as simple as possible (could be
better. vmware requested we cease distribution of the combined
janusvm+player+one-click-installer due to their licensing terms on the
player distribution)
b.) performing all of the anonymous Tor proxy of traffic transparently
at the network level using a default PPTP VPN route through the
virtual machine.
the user feedback has been positive, since this obviates the need for
error prone and tedious application specific configuration to use Tor,
and avoids leaking information when a plug-in or scripting facility
has the ability to bypass application proxy settings or is not
resolving addresses via SOCKSv4a / MapAddr.  (not to mention that some
applications which don't even support SOCKS or HTTP proxies can now
use Tor)
"encrypted communications as a matter of course" is not yet dead.
it's just taking a little longer than anyone expected back when the
battle was raging over cipher implementations and encrypted network
protocols with nary a thought to end user experience.

@_subject: [p2p-hackers] AES CTR vs. CBC, other [was: Re: security and 
i believe the "CTR chaining" weakness mentioned above is in regards to
the use of an explicit IV in IPsec for counter mode (CTR or CM) just
like CBC mode, for per packet synchronization, even though it is not
absolutely required. [0].
as a more general note, there are indeed some nice advantages to counter mode:
 - simplicity
  - parallelizable / pipeline-able
 - random access
  - lack of random IV's (generating entropy is hard and slow unless
you have a physical source).
and some drawbacks / constraints:
  - leaks plaintext size without padding (other modes just leak size
in terms of blocks)
 - vulnerable to time memory trade off attacks [1]
  - failure to prevent keystream reuse is catastrophic [2]
 - a strong message authentication code (MAC) must always be used [2]
as a side note, it is common to include entropy in the initial counter
value (64 bits of entropy + 64 bit counter) to avoid the time memory
trade off weaknesses.
using a random IV (like CTR in IPsec specifies) adds some overhead,
but avoids the time memory trade off as well as ensuring no keystream
reuse.  hardware entropy sources are great for this purpose since
entropy gathering daemons are notoriously slow.

bootstrapping is hard, particularly when you must include a robust

narrow, as what you seek is exactly a robust reputation / trust metric
tied to the economy of peer interaction.  digital cash is attractive
because the reputation it embodies is fungible, but other forms of
reputation are useful and may prove more effective in certain
contexts, particularly when your adversary is well funded (think
"creeping death attacks"). [0]

some highlights:
D-Wave approach: Superconducting adiabatic quantum computer
- Extremely fast: Special purpose processor; superconducting
electronics are naturally fast (700+ GHz)
- Extremely low power: In principle reversible (zero heat generation);
in practice power consumption & heat generation drastically reduced
(factors of millions)
- At the limits of physics: Universal quantum computer can't do better
slides 14-21 are nice visualizations of the adiabatic QC implementation and use.
adiabatic quantum computation model:
- Computer initialized in "easy to reach" (convex) ground state
- Answer encoded in final state
- All currents adjusted slowly enough so that system remains in ground
state at all times
- AQC can be universal for QC  [ed: this is the crux, algorithms to
express some problems in AQC model difficult (right now)]
- AQC is exact by definition
quantum annealing computation model:
- Computer initialized in ground state
- Answer encoded in final state
- All currents adjusted over period of time fixed by user [ed: key
difference wrt AQC]
- QA is a heuristic algorithm [ed: key difference wrt AQC]
D-Wave processors can implement either AQC or QA models of computation.
Summary of preliminary result
- A set of progressively more powerful superconducting quantum

- Next generation Q3/2008 targets competition with incumbent QUBO

@_subject: [dave@farber.net: [IP] New Short Video: "Is Your Cell Phone 
good stuff.
predominantly the following are the best give away, and seem to apply
to some models and not others:
[via "A well designed bug program could try to minimize the obviousness of
this by quickly dropping the bug call if the phone owner tried to make
an outgoing call, or drop the bug connection if an incoming call tried
to ring through. But if the bug is up and running, that's the only
transmission path that is available on the phone at that time for the
vast majority of currently deployed cell phones."
this is undetectable on some models, and causes a few seconds of "one
way conference" style problems on others.  basically, you answer/call,
and get silence, neither party can hear each other for a few seconds.
"But if your battery seems to be running out of juice far too early
(despite what the phone's battery status display might claim), that
might be an indication that your phone is being used to transmit
behind your back (though a worn out battery or inaccurate battery
status display could also be the culprits).
Another clue that a phone may have been transmitting without your
permission is if it seems unexpectedly warm. You've probably noticed
how most cell phones heat up, especially on longer calls. This is
normal, but if you haven't been on any calls for a while and your cell
phone is warm as if long calls were in progress, you have another red
flag indication of something odd perhaps going on."
this is a good indicator, and particularly on some phones with
excellent battery life (some sanyo/motorola models) it becomes real
obvious when unusual battery drain is occurring.
"Finally, if you use a GSM phone (like the vast majority of phones
around the world, including Cingular and T-Mobile in the U.S.) you
have a virtually foolproof way to know if you phone is secretly
transmitting in voice mode. You've probably noticed the "buzzing"
interference that these phones tend to make in nearby speakers when
calls or data transmissions are in progress. A certain amount of
periodic routine communications between cell phones and the networks
will occur while the phones are powered on -- even when calls are not
in progress -- so short bursts of buzzing between calls (and when
turning the phones on or off) are normal.
But if you're not on a call, and you hear a continuing rapid
buzz-buzz-buzz in nearby speakers that lasts more than a few seconds
and gets louder as you approach with your phone, well, the odds are
that your phone is busily transmitting, and bugging is a definite
possibility. Note that this particular test is much less reliable with
non-GSM phones that use CDMA (e.g. Sprint/Verizon phones), since
CDMA's technology is less prone to producing easily audible local
interference. This strongly suggests that CDMA phones may be preferred
for such bugging operations."
this is a smoking gun on a GSM phone, and unfortunately it does not
work against CDMA, as mentioned.
take the battery out, it works great. :)

I read this in cryptome today and it makes me puzzled: did somebody
piss you off? Or is this the a nugget of distilled wisdom from
somebody else?
Cryptome: Spies and ex-spies are required by terms of employment and
training to lie, deceive, betray, commit crimes, and keep it secret.
If they cannot convincingly lie and break laws without getting caught
under all kinds of conditions as taught and tested in the US at the
Farm, they will not be hired. They lie to families and friends, to
everybody not in spyworld and often in spyworld too as a test and as a
duty. They are experts at appearing to be what they are not.
It is a common spy tradecraft to claim to be an ex-spy or ex-agent,
aggrieved, ready to spill secrets, their managers feigning offense,
blessing the spew by invoking national security threats, pretending
the miscreant is a rogue.
No spy or ex-spy ever tells the full story, only offers enticing tales
that mesmerize the gullible and attempts to outwit accomplished
doubters, whether other spies, agents, journalists, oversight
committees, investigative commissions or the public. None are ever
free to tell all they know, and face severe penalties if not death for
telling more selected secrets than allowed to lend credence to their
deceptions. So come the orchestrated dissenters, scholars, novelists,
confessors, professors, exposers of perfidy and anonymous leakers,
dispensing plausible disinformation purpose-made.
That's the deal spies and agents sign on to and cannot ever escape,
and are told so at the time of engagement, not that many want out of
the privileges such as that provided by the bountifully bloated US
Intelligence Community Management Fund which bribes sealed lips, most
assuredly for retirees and exes continuing to work their undercover
Anybody who claims to be a spy or ex-spy is a person unable to tell
the truth, and gets paid and pensioned for well-crafted accounts of
what is not, what to fear, what to doubt, who to distrust. Analyze the
Association For Intelligence Officers (AFIO),  and
numerous similar organizations around the planet for what they tell
and what they conceal in open deception.
The pervasive lies of spyworld -- officers, agents, contractors and

i love the exclamation points in title.  makes for a wide grin on the
faces of those fatigued with constitutional destruction overload.
ah, outrage and disbelief...  seems like ages ago i could muster such
reaction to the abuse of powers that be.
In July 1987, then-Representative Dick Cheney, the top Republican on
the committee investigating the Iran-contra scandal, turned on his
hearing room microphone and delivered, in his characteristically
measured tone, a revolutionary claim...
"I personally do not believe the Boland Amendment applied to the
president, nor to his immediate staff," Cheney said.
Most of Cheney's colleagues did not share his vision of a presidency
empowered to bypass US laws governing foreign policy. The committee
issued a scathing, bipartisan report accusing White House officials of
"disdain for the law."
Cheney refused to sign it. Instead, he commissioned his own report
declaring that the real lawbreakers were his fellow lawmakers, because
the Constitution "does not permit Congress to pass a law usurping
Presidential power."
The Iran-contra scandal was not the first time the future vice
president articulated a philosophy of unfettered executive power --
nor would it be the last. The Constitution empowers Congress to pass
laws regulating the executive branch, but over the course of his
career, Cheney came to believe that the modern world is too dangerous
and complex for a president's hands to be tied. He embraced a belief
that presidents have vast "inherent" powers, not spelled out in the
Constitution, that allow them to defy Congress.
Cheney bypassed acts of Congress as defense secretary in the first
Bush administration. And his office has been the driving force behind
the current administration's hoarding of secrets, its efforts to
impose greater political control over career officials, and its
defiance of a law requiring the government to obtain warrants when
wiretapping Americans. Cheney's staff has also been behind President
Bush's record number of signing statements asserting his right to
disregard laws.

right.  tap all the interesting fibers, feed to narus.
the narus is there specifically so they don't have to backhaul a
mirror of the traffic.  it does all the inspection to isolate
interesting information, then sends back that interesting information
to aggregation points, before that in turn is sent on to NSA.
the bridgeton center att noc is a good example.  there is a room
controlled by multi-factor biometric authentication (print, retinal)
with man trap doors.  this is probably the room used for distributing
configuration to the remote monitoring points (it's unlikely they
store much of interest at the remote sites, since the security is much
lower at these places) as well as aggregation of the feeds for
backhaul to NSA.
see also the new NSA facilities being built in denver, CO.  this is an
ideal place to aggregate traffic across the country...
from the sounds of it, the taps did introduce some problems which were
resolved quickly.  probably not from signal loss, but who knows.

We describe a new simple but more power-
ful form of linear cryptanalysis. It appears to break AES
(and undoubtably other cryptosystems too, e.g. SKIP-
JACK). The break is "nonconstructive," i.e. we make it
plausible (e.g. prove it in certain approximate probabilis-
tic models) that a small algorithm for quickly determining
AES-256 keys from plaintext-ciphertext pairs exists b but
without constructing the algorithm. The attack's runtime
is comparable to performing 64w encryptions where w is
the (unknown) minimum Hamming weight in certain bi-
nary linear error-correcting codes (BLECCs) associated
with AES-256. If w < 43 then our attack is faster than ex-
haustive key search; probably w < 10. (Also there should
be ciphertext-only attacks if the plaintext is natural En-
AES's current status. In view of both (a) Bernstein's tim-
ing attack, (b) our nonconstructive argument for a cracking
algorithm, (c) the possibility of a "'trapdoor," we believe that
   1. AES should be abandoned
   2. cryptosystems provably immune to these attacks should
      be investigated, and
   3. our argument for crack-existence, since it is nonrigor-
      ous5 , should be investigated more carefully.
3.6    Now get paranoid
Suppose AES-256's designers had evilly arranged matters so
that some "code of the code" (known to them) unexpectedly,
contained a remarkably low-weight word (known to them),
with say, w 10. That would constitute a trapdoor enabling
cracking it with much smaller eo,ort 64w . If w = 10, they
could crack AES with 6410 = 260 pc-pairs. If w = 7 then
AES-256 would be as easy to crack as the cited attacks on
DES (only 242 pc-pairs needed)!
This could be the case even if the random codes approxima-
tion underlying our crude analysis in B'3.3 was invalid.
4 What now?
Obviously, B'2's strengthened form of linear cryptanalysis will
attack a wide variety of secret key cryptosystems, not just
AES-256, and will quite often raise the worry that there might
exist some intentionally or unintentionally inserted "trap-
door." I currently see no feasible way for AES's designers
to disprove the existence of this kind of trapdoor. And Bern-
stein's cache-timing attack [4] seems applicable against es-
sentially any system that employs Sboxes. That's a lot of
In short, almost every secret key cryptosystem yet proposed is
now busted or at least suspect. We need to design new kinds
of cryptosystems immune to both kinds of attack.

... Imagine a government agency, in a bureaucratic foul-up,
accidentally gives you a copy of a document marked "top secret." And
it contains a log of some of your private phone calls.
You read it and ponder it and wonder what it all means. Then, two
months later, the FBI shows up at your door, demands the document back
and orders you to forget you ever saw it.
... al-Buthi and Al-Haramain's American branch were added to the
government's public list of terrorists on Sept. 9, 2004, just weeks
after the government turned over the call log to the charity's
attorneys. It's not clear when officials realized they'd given a
highly classified document to an organization they considered
terrorist, but the FBI showed up at Belew's office in October and
demanded the call log back, advising the lawyer not to attempt to
remember the document's contents.
By then, Belew had given a copy of the document to Washington Post
reporter David Ottaway, who had been writing about how the government
investigated and listed individuals and groups suspected of funding
terrorism. Ottaway did not report on the classified call log, and when
the FBI called, the Post dutifully handed over its copy.
That might have been the end of it. But in December 2005 The New York
Times revealed that the government had been spying on Americans'
overseas communications without warrants, and Al-Haramain's lawyers
realized why the FBI had been so adamant about getting the document
"I got up in the morning and read the story, and I thought, 'My god,
we had a log of a wiretap and it may or may not have been the NSA and
on further reflection it was NSA," says Thomas Nelson, who represents
Al-Haramain and Belew. "So we decided to file a lawsuit."

hi Steven; an enjoyable read.  thank you!
i am curious about a few aspects.
you state "an assumption that the global passive adversary is
unrealistic".  is this really true in anonymity research circles?  it
seems the evidence to the contrary is well supported.  i do prefer the
"those who are the target of such adversaries have larger problems
than anonymous Internet access" statement instead.  :)
i am also curious if you had considered lower layer propinquity of
physical paths.  critical infrastructure research has shown how even
seemingly disparate and redundant paths are often inhabiting common
right of way and facilities.  is the assumption that inspection at
OC/WDM layers is too cumbersome/expensive for all but the previously
mentioned TLA/$gov adversaries?
given the surprises looking at network topology from an IX rather than
AS level, i'd expect a similar revelation when viewing from an optical
carrier vantage point.
sadly, the information useful for such study has become a subject of

Some of you might remember my email to this list in February, where I
asked for help from operators of Tor nodes in the UK [1]. This was for
an experiment to establish how diverse the topology of the Tor network
is -- an important component of how secure it is against traffic
analysis. Thanks to all those who responded to my request; I had a
great response and very interesting results.
I've now finished the draft version of the resulting paper, which is
to be presented at the PET Workshop (Ottawa, Canada, June 20--22 2007)
[2]. The latest version of the paper can be found at this URL:
 There is also an introduction to the area, and a summary of the paper
on my research group's blog "Light Blue Touchpaper":
 My paper, co-authored with Piotr Zielinksi, is a follow-up to Nick
Feamster and Roger Dingledine's paper, "Location Diversity in
Anonymity Networks" [3]. In it, they point out that bouncing anonymity
network traffic around lots of countries might not be as good as it
seems because there are a small number of ISPs which show up on many
of the links to, from and between Tor nodes.
What our paper explores is that even if you deal with this problem,
and choose paths with a diverse collection of ISPs, there are still
Internet exchanges on many of the paths. These do not appear in the
BGP data that Feamster and Dingledine use, which is why I had to
resort to a more limited-scale traceroute-based study.
So not only are Internet Exchanges good places to put traffic analysis
equipment, but some (including LINX [4] and AMS-IX [5]) collect the
necessary data anyway, for performance measurement purposes. They only
record the headers of one in every few thousand packets, but our paper
also shows that, even with such low-quality data, traffic analysis
still works.
There's certainly no reason to panic about these results, as there is
still much more work to be done in this area. For example, the picture
in the US, where Internet exchanges are less popular, will likely be
different. I do hope that the paper will encourage future work on both
establishing more accurate estimates of attack costs and developing

the exit wall of sheep (embassy passwds) was lame but the control port
opener was nifty.
sequence for the control port payload injection:
- two vectors for form payload, a third for ip leakage across three
proxies on broadband
- javascript posts form automatically to localhost:9051 using:
 action=" method="post"
enctype="multipart/form-data" target="stylearea"  [that last to keep
the response from the tor control part spewing over the current page -
this puts it in a hidden iframe]
- all existing <FORM's in exit requests modified via proxies to inject
the TEXTAREA with payload into a hidden form element while leaving the
appearance of a legitimate form page (so any submit pwns, too late.
even lynx on openbsd if your control port is on 127.0.0.1:9051 (or any
accessible port if you've got a motivated attacker...))
- IP leakage for all IE on win32 users that aren't using a transparent
proxy (janusvm) via SMB/NetBIOS and WebDAV to external host with
tracking nonce directory name.  even if the control port is not open,
this will leak the origin of the request as webdav is below the
browser, interpreted in the file system / win32 api context. (SMB is
not nearly as useful as webdav since most ISPs filter NetBIOS and
SMB/CIFS traffic even if you explicitly allow at the router.)
- the purpose of the payload was an interesting 150-200k+ command set
for the control port to apply.  among various things this performed
the following:
- redirect the notice log to /dev/null on *nix like systems or to a
webdav path on one of the proxies. (this leaks ip immediately on win32
in addition to routing ongoing notices messages to the proxy directly.
- invalidate all known authentic nodes on the existing Tor network via
ExcludeNodes with digests, configure three new rogue nodes as
authoritative directories and exits, and finally starting a hidden
service and posting the .onion name to the proxy server.
- map local ports to the hidden service onion allowing an anonymous
user on the rogue Tor network to arbitrarily connect to the client
onion and interface with their Tor control port in real time.
- vulnerable Tor clients (not using transparent proxy like janusvm)
start falling by the thousands into the rogue Tor network for the
duration of a few hours while the attack was being tested...

i've been using the VIA padlock XSTORE instruction for entropy since
at least 2003, back when the C5XL hit the stage and you had a single
source (a combination of three free wheeling oscillators).
the next revision, the C5P, and all C5/C7 cores since than have
included two of these sources, individually selectable or capable of
working in tandem. (6 oscillators)
the throughput of these devices varies from 200k-2Mbps in a most
paranoid configuration, with whitener enabled and a conservative
sampling, up to more than 100Mbps in dual full throttle configuration
(which should only be used when the on die AES or SHA1 is applied to
obscure TRNG bias).
Toshiba Corp. has claimed a major breakthrough in the field of
security technology: It has devised the world's highest-performance
physical random-number generator (RNG) circuit.
The device generates random numbers at a data rate of 2.0 megabits a
second, according to Toshiba in a paper presented at the International
Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) here.
i must assume they are splitting hairs here, as VIA is not the only
one to outperform such benchmarks, but you do buy the whole chip, not
a stand-alone TRNG IC component.
in any case, it is amusing that they got such mileage from a
masturbatory press release, while things like padlock, integrating
crypto directly into CPU instructions, seems to garner less respect
and press.
last but not least, i recently purchased an Everex 15.4" StepNote
NC1610 Laptop PC w/ Via C7-M Processor [0].  spend the $30 to bring
this up to 2G of ram, and you've got an excellent little linux laptop
that can handle full disk crypto with ease (i've even benchmarked
loop-aes with 32 rounds in AES-256, just for fun, which the XCRYPT
instruction handles without breaking a sweat).
if you're concerned about all that border search stupidity, and tired
of software FDE or cryptainer compromises, this is a great
i've long been a fan of these cores, and i think any cypherpunk would
appreciate the capability these tiny, low power chips posses in terms
of crypto horsepower.
[i will, however, never forgive them for the abomination that is the
padlock hash engine.  why they required the SHA instruction to
finalize, limited the digest input size, and requiring an elaborate
fault to get an un-finalized state, is beyond me.  however, the rest
of the chip makes of up such a shortcoming, all things considered]

@_subject: 1.7 GBit/s RNG by laser feedback 
it is useful to whiten and/or mask any potential bias of the entropy
source with a run through a cipher or digest.  it's important to note
that you should be verifying entropy before this step (FIPS sanity
checks) otherwise your RNG could be highly biased and you'd not notice
from the whitened, masked output.
there are two schools of hardware entropy harvesting thought:
- use a von Neumann whitener to distill the raw entropy into a high
quality, low (single bit) bias source. this will also cut throughput
by an order of magnitude, perhaps.
- use a block cipher or digest to mask any bias that may be present in
an un-whitened, wide open source.
the latter seems to be gaining popularity, and of course it doesn't
hurt to do both.
this is indeed not a huge leap over VIA padlock's dual on core sources
(XSTORE) which also have AES on core for the masking above - these can
hit 100Mbps with whitening disabled and both sources enabled.  if
you're initializing FDE drives with good entropy this 1.7Gbps might be
useful.  otherwise i have a hard time consuming even a fraction of the
available entropy on a VIA system in normal use.

i was focused on the whitened vs. raw entropy in the previous post and
overlooked the point you were getting at.
it is good practice to use more than one hardware entropy source in a
system.  (on VIA's boards, only the first gen C5XL cores had a single
source, after that two are always present).
if one fails you have a backup and combined they can double
throughput.  if your requirements necessitate a high throughput
hardware (true) entropy source you can't fall back on software and
host entropy scavenging - it's just too slow. so you get two or more
sources and expect at least one to be functional for the lifetime of
the system.
there doesn't seem to be any additional technical detail about this
setup so perhaps we'll find out more later...

my apologies for focusing solely on the price/money angle. there is a
good post about incentives on the Tor blog that covers similar ideas
and discusses the complexities and pit falls associated:
using loom for settlement is probably too much overhead for Tor but is
aiming closer to what is needed.
my issue with money payment in particular is described in this paragraph:
"On top of that are the social implications of adding money into the
system. Nick keeps reminding me of sociological studies saying that
rewarding volunteers with t-shirts makes them feel good about their
contribution, whereas rewarding them with a small amount of cash makes
them subconsciously start to value their contribution based on the
cash you give them. So they're more likely to stop volunteering, as
they don't feel their effort is properly appreciated. More details
here[0], here[1], and here[2]. It's hard to say how right this
research is, but it seems a rough set of variables to add in if we can
avoid it."

@_subject: hardware acceleration available for Tor ? On FreeBSD ? 
speeding up OpenSSL derived CTR mode with hardware acceleration is
useful. (the HardwareAccel and EngineName options above)
speeding up Tor with native hardware acceleration and chained /
repetitive CTR offload is a much bigger win. as an example the VIA
Padlock engine can do a few score MBytes/sec aes 128 with small/single
block sizes like those used when HardwareAccel is on and EngineName
padlock set. if you could utilize the maximum 16KByte rep instruction
mode directly goes well over a gigabyte / second. this is also why the
native Solaris API CTR mode gives much better performance than the
OpenSSL engine acceleration.
speeding up OpenSSL pubkey ops also helps. as of OpenSSL 0.9.9 and
1.0.x you can build OpenSSL with padlock MONTMULT acceleration. still
no dynamic engine support for pubkey ops iirc...
there will be some benefit as Tor wraps a CTR mode around
(accelerated) OpenSSL ECB mode. the problem is that this method is
limited to single blocks per call, rather than long buffers optimized
for crypto offload.
you may also get SHA acceleration. the notices log should say, for example:
[info] crypto_global_init(): Initializing OpenSSL engine support.
[info] crypto_global_init(): Initializing dynamic OpenSSL engine
"padlock" acceleration support.
[info] crypto_global_init(): Loaded dynamic OpenSSL engine "padlock".
[info] crypto_global_init(): Loaded OpenSSL hardware acceleration
engine, setting default ciphers.
[info] Using default implementation for RSA
[info] Using default implementation for DH
[info] Using default implementation for RAND
[notice] Using OpenSSL engine VIA PadLock: RNG (not used) ACE2
PHE(8192) PMM  [padlock] for SHA1
[info] Using default implementation for 3DES
[notice] Using OpenSSL engine VIA PadLock: RNG (not used) ACE2
PHE(8192) PMM  [padlock] for AES
not necessarily, per above :)
it would also be nice to have these routines native for other engines,
like padlock. however this is not a small amount of effort and no one
with time and skill has shown an interest yet. (Tor buffer allocation
alignment to 16K, inline padlock instr. calls in REP mode, and other
changes required.)
there are kernel cryptographic facilities including asm optimized and
hardware accelerated crypto primitives. these are usually not utilized
from userspace directly. there are PKCS specs for communicating with
offload devices in a concise manner, and libs of various types to
speak this to myraid hardware. perhaps a longer discussion should be
taken off list...
the T2 is core acceleration and thus higher throughput for most
purposes. the 6000 is useful as a hardened private key store service
for your less trusted OS and software to cooperate with.
Tor would need to be updated to take advantage of the new CTR mode in
the OpenSSL API calls, but then the same HardwareAccel (and AccelName)
options would provide a significant improvement over the previous
acceleration mode.

Since Intel
uh, what? you realize you're comparing a very noisy but very very
small entity against the remaining core of a modern many hundred
million gate processor right?
you can certainly disable / idle the sources when not needed, but
really, left wide open all the time they're a drop in the bucket.
it is the throughput and efficiency that makes it most useful. like
the AES XCRYPT instruction in VIA Padlock cores. you may avoid a
number of cache timing and other timing based side channel attacks on
software cipher implementations using hw as well, since they often
execute one or more rounds in a handful of cycles. there are probably
other advantages.
the crypto cluefull know the value of mixing a high throughput, easily
managed entropy source with host and application true random number
facilities (/dev/random, /dev/urandom, OpenSSL random engine support,
XSTORE instruction in userspace, etc.)
the key to using a hw source properly:
1. initialize, measure, and mix the raw source(s) with a userspace
entropy daemon.
2. continuously sanity check the read data over a large byte span and
remove a hardware entropy source that is not functioning within
comfortable tolerance. FIPS does have a nice suite of checks - again,
this can't prove your source is robust, only that it doesn't suck
horribly and obviously. :)
3. run the hw random data through a block cipher or hash digest to
mask generator bias before adding to host entropy facilities with a
conservative entropy density estimate. while the VIA and other good HW
sources can produce very high density output i prefer at most an 80%
estimation on input for robust distribution into the host pool as
4. periodically save state for use with mixing initialization in step
 on next restart.
5. monitor without writing if anomalies in the hw sources arise during
operation. with VIA XSTORE on C5P or greater (not C5XL with single
source) you have two independent sources which can be enabled or
disabled as needed. on such systems you can fall back to half-rate
throughput on the good source if the other goes bad.
if you mean "raw" as in omitting all of the steps above and just
reading /dev/hwrandom then i agree. otherwise, see above. :)
i can get > 80Mbps of entropy on VIA hw entropy sources. have you ever
tried to use /dev/random on a headless server? a recently booted
workstation? for more than a few keys at a time? etc?
keep secure state, properly mixed, and even a highly biased input
would be whitened and obscured beyond utility. i'd like to see
reasoning otherwise for XSTORE sources and XCRYPT AES mixing before
conservatively mixed into properly seeded /dev/random kernel pool. if
it is too biased (OpenSSL weak keys :) then the FIPS sanity checks
will kick it out and you're denied entropy rather than compromised
it's really a shame crypto isn't standard on every DIE. although if
they do a poor job of it the annoyance outweighs the utility. the SHA
instruction on Padlock borders on unusable without hacks like
interrupting the REP mode instruction with a fault/intr. so you can
grab the un-finalized work-in-progress digest state for large

i agree completely on all of the sad realities related to the
non-existence of pervasive hw crypto facilities.
the power consumption argument is a strawman though. the VIA docs
stated a power consumption difference when XSTORE is configured and
polled frequently vs. explicitly disabled and unused. the details are
fuzzy though, and i suspect it's the rest of the pipeline around
actual use of HWRNG state and moving across cache/bus lines...
i would be curious to know the power details on any of the hw entropy
sources, if any are out there.

"encrypted" one (even web content looks high-entropy to Diehard when
i have loved the padlock engines on via cores since they hit the
market in C5XL form with a single hw generator available via XSTORE.
unlike many designs this free wheeling resource can provide a torrent
of entropy sufficient to sate even the most gregarious consumption.
as mentioned above, you need a fast user space entropy daemon sanity
checking the raw, (probably) biased stream coming from hardware but it
is still good practice to digest this entropy to obscure any potential
generator state/bias heading into the host entropy pool.
that is to say, of the two common modes for utilizing hw entropy:
a. conservatively sample from a whitened, string filtered entropy
source for a low rate of high quality output (see xstore config words)
b. ramp un-whitened, un-filtered source(s) to maximum rate and AES/SHA
mix for high throughput, high quality output while irreversibly
masking generator bias/state present in the raw source stream.
the latter is more effective in practice and capable of generation
rates > 20Mbps with full FIPS sanity checks. the former tops out
around 1Mbps or less with more transient latency spikes on read (when
successive attempts to read fail to pass whiten+strfilter). note that
padlock engine supports SHA and AES on die as well making these easy
and fast to apply to generator output.
if you are still concerned a more conservative configuration would
estimate entropy density while feeding from raw input stream and add
encrypted/digested product to the host entropy pool with the specified
entropy density estimate adjusted downward to your requirements. (most
OS'es support this)

---------- Forwarded message ----------
while most were enjoying libations or talks a very interesting event
was taking place at the conference.
we're all familiar with the hostility of WiFi and GSM networks at DEF
CON, however, this year the most hostile network on earth was not
802.11; it was CDMA and 4G!
on Friday some parts of Anon and Lulz made appearance. by early
Saturday morning a weapon was deployed.
some characteristics:
- full active MitM against CDMA and 4G connections from Rio to carriers.
- MitM positioning for remote exploitation to ring0 on Android and PC.
- fall back to userspace only or non-persistent methods when
persistent rootkit unattainable.
- many attack trees and weaponized exploits. escalation from easy pwns
up to specialized techniques and tactics until success is achieved.
- simultaneous attack across CDMA and 4G connections using full power
in these LICENSED bands.
- operated continuously (except for outages :) from early Saturday
until 8am Monday.
- designed with intent: mass exploitation, reconnaissance,
exfiltration, eavesdropping.
how to tell if you met the beast at Rio:
- did you accept an upgrade for Android, Java, or other applications? (oops)
- did you notice 3G/4G signal anomalies, including full signal yet
poor bandwidth or no link?
- did you notice your Android at full charged plugged in, but dropping
to <50% charge once unplugged?
- did you notice 4G download speeds at quarter of usual, yet uploads
over twice as fast?
- did you notice Android services that immediately respawn when
killed? (Voice Search?)
- does your Android no longer connect to USB debugging yet adbd is alive?
- does your PC have an sshd that cannot be kill -9'd?
- did your Android crash - a hard freeze, and then take a long time to
...many other indicators, but for now that's sufficient to express the point.
if you met the beast, it seemed to have a nearly perfect success rate;
your odds not good.  in fact you probably didn't even notice as it
pilfered bytes off your devices and monitored your conversations.
i have waited over six DEF CONs to meet an adversary of this skill.

Traditional digital forensics encompasses the examination of data from

is intact on these images, a number of forensics techniques are
available for analysis such as file and metadata examination,
timelining, deleted file recovery, indexing, and searching. Live CDs
present a large problem for this forensics model though as they run
solely in RAM and do not interact with the local disk. This removes
the ability to perform an orderly examination since the filesystem is
no longer readily available and putting random pages of data into
context can be very difficult for in-depth investigations. In order to
solve this problem, we present a number of techniques that allow for
complete recovery of a live CDbs in-memory filesystem and partial
recovery of its previously deleted contents. We also present memory

@_subject: [cryptography] Intel RNG 
these rates often are not useful. even busy secure web or VPN servers
use orders of magnitude less.
initialization of full disk crypto across an SSD RAID could consume
it, but that's the only "practical" use case i've encountered so far
that said, a typical host entropy gathering daemon is often
insufficient, and even off-die serial bus and other old skewl sources
were providing entropy in kbit/sec rates, not MByte/sec.
some (many?) HWRNG designs use bit accumulators that feed a register
that is read by a userspace instruction.
consider the following configuration:
- this register is collecting single bits from two high speed
oscillators that is sub-sampling single bits at a quarter clock.
- only whitened / non-run bits collected, as set in a configuration
write / initialization.
in short: providing slow, non-deterministic output rates to this
entropy instruction.
if the instruction is configured to not-block, you could starve the
available pool in one thread, in one process, by using it
if the instruction is configured to block, you could introduce
significantly processing delays (unexpectedly so?) to other consumers
in other threads of execution, or other processes.
Intel did an end run around this problem with the DRBG, which is
similar to urandom, in the sense that it does not provide a 1:1
correlation of entropy in the system to entropy bits returned out, as
you may get in /dev/random linux behavior, which blocks once the
kernel entropy pool is exhausted. (that's another rant/tangent. let's
not go there :)
it is also seeding from the physical noise sources, running sanity
checks of some type, and then handing over to DRBG. so there is
clearly more involved than just a call to AES-NI. 3x as expensive
doesn't sound unreasonable if the seeding and validation overhead is
that's a great idea, and my reading of it is that they have said as
much. perhaps they should more clearly state it so for the usual case.
my understanding is that you will never fail unless the hardware
itself "starts up"? with a broken physical source returning clearly
invalid bits.
E.g. "In the rare event that the DRNG fails during runtime, it would
cease to issue random numbers rather than issue poor quality random
as for stating that it should never "run dry", or fail to not return
bits as long as the instruction is working, no matter how frequently
it is invoked, see:
With respect to the RNG taxonomy discussed above, the DRNG follows the
cascade construction RNG model, using a processor resident entropy
source to repeatedly seed a hardware-implemented CSPRNG. Unlike
software approaches, it includes a high-quality entropy source
implementation that can be sampled quickly to repeatedly seed the
CSPRNG with high-quality entropy. Furthermore, it represents a
self-contained hardware module that is isolated from software attacks
on its internal state. The result is a solution that achieves RNG
objectives with considerable robustness: statistical quality
(independence, uniform distribution), highly unpredictable random
number sequences, high performance, and protection against attack.

my last comment for this sad, confused tangent of a thread;
  it has been accosted via conjecture with too much frequency *grin*
SCTP for congestion control of transparent proxy TCP/UDP traffic.
local classification of traffic allocates by protocol / use fairness
instead of aggregate tcp fairness. like bittorrent or aria2 parallel
traffic treated as distinct low priority unit of traffic, deferring to
higher priority low latency web traffic and messaging.
multi-homing / multi-path endpoints in SCTP would maintain concurrent
connection with distinct endpoints, avoiding predecessor, timing,
denial of service attacks present in reliable, ordered, single stream
edges would be screwed as you mention, unless they were full fledged
participants consistently. using a UDP based transport with LEDBAT or
other technique to keep broadband upstream unsaturated and unclogged
(no deep queues), allowing all broadband endpoints the ability to
contribute to a large shared network.
ORCHID IPv6 addressing with IPsec tunnels is intended to re-use
existing work, including well tested auth+privacy with datagram
padding in IPsec. SCTP+TLS would fit over top of IPv6 ORCHID endpoints
(using IPsec SAs) to transport signalling/keying and encapsulated
client traffic. part of this would also include lowest priority (lossy
reliable) SRMP type delivery of useful, less immediate information to
nodes. to some extent the ORCHID addresses could be thought of as
hidden service names and also circuit endpoints for a given IPsec
this set of:
a. critical signalling and keying traffic
b. high priority, interactive web traffic and messaging
c. lower priority bulk traffic, downloads, streaming media
d. best effort, latent bulk caching and exchange
are the classful shaping groups ordered inside of opaque SFQ outbound
queues at various improved/concurrent stratified dependent link
padding paths of IPsec telescopes carrying intermediate
hop(signalling) and bearer traffic.
combining better prioritization of traffic and consistent consumption
of traffic (deferring low priority packets and using opportunistic
caching strategies for network information respectively) obtains the
best performance out of the SFQ DLP paths with the lowest latency for
priority traffic.
still, so many details left as exercise for the reader ;)
sort of, for only parts; if you want a portable user space
implementation (or port) it's all custom. the joys of wild conjecture
include absurd timelines and technical effort for free...
rump is about as close as i've seen: this is not the least of "how to deploy a thing like this" concerns.
there is also no backward compatibility or slow transition from an
existing Tor network to something using UDP encapsulated IPsec

i've been contemplating a write up about this, but the problem is once

there really is "security through obscurity" in this sense; when at a
resource disadvantage, every little bit counts...
if i were to summarize what i have found effective against dedicated
and resourceful attackers (again, i can't go into details :) this
would be the top 5:
1. use a common distro, but rebuild critical components - bootloader,
initramfs, openssl, openssh, the kernel, gnutls, libgmp, use 64bit,
2. use isolation and RBAC, Qubes, VirtualBox, VMWare, Parallels,
remember that VM escapes are available and expected. defense in depth
can never be too deep.
3. use constrained network access - identify anomalies, control
bandwidth, firewall ingress and egress aggressively. this implies
constant monitoring to detect such events. (another exercise left to
the reader)
4. rootkit and backdoor your own systems - use the dirty tricks to
observe and constrain your system before someone else uses dirty
tricks to compromise your system.
5. don't forget physical security - this is the universal oversight
and most effective end run around all other operational and technical
security measures. there is a reason physical access so often implies
"game over" and why black bag jobs are still and will continue to be
effective against all targets.

some questions, some answers, ...
this means rebuild hardened versions of these libraries from source;
  excluding insecure cipher suites in an OpenSSL build for example,
  altering architecture optimizations, supported features, in others,
the goal being that an exploit targeted to a vanilla distribution will
more likely fail with observable error or crash, rather than succeed
many exploits are very brittle in this respect, with any change in
symbol offsets or capabilities rendering them completely ineffective.
virtualization implies chained exploits for full compromise. combined
with the above you've drastically increased the cost of a successful
attack with modest effort. the likelihood of detection (by appearing
vulnerable yet not being so) is also increased.
remember that VMMs and hypervisors are themselves potentially
vulnerable software systems suitable for hardening and customization.
data exfiltration can be very visible via network behavior if you're
paying attention.  cross referencing connection state in your upstream
router vs. local OS view of sockets can identify discrepancies where
compromise has concealed covert connections. malware communicating

visible at this junction.
this is mostly a variant of  at a kernel / system level.  like
notepad.exe connecting to the internet, there are some syscall, file
access, and network requests which are clearly anomalous and
indicators of compromise.
this is a storied tangent unto itself...
last but not least: you must develop a routine of continuous hardening
and improvement. these steps are not done once and finished; they are
elements within a larger strategy of operational rigor defending
against motivated and capable attackers. asking for my "hardened linux

one last cautionary tale:
some time back i used the techniques discussed to harden some Android
phones brought with me into a hostile environment. i had kernel level
protections in place, hardened the system configuration and services,
pared down apps to the minimum and constrained their access to the
file system and network. this was months of effort.
the first adversarial encounter went very well in my favor - all of
the attempts to exploit my devices were thwarted at these various
layers and via these protections, with the sole exception of a Google
Voice Search hack that kept voice search active in an "open mic night"
eavesdropping capability.  this was quickly nullified via kill -STOP
(Android won't re-spawn an app that is already running, and a stopped
process proved quite effective at halting this repeated invocation of
search used to capture audio.)
fast forward to round two, and i doubled down on the kernel, system,
and application level protections. even more scrutiny is applied to
applications to avoid the misuse of legitimate functionality for
malicious purpose.  i am feeling confident!
... and then a baseband exploit easily walks under all of my
protections at every layer, completely and fully 0wning my devices,
with the only hint at anything amiss being the elevated thermal
dissipation and power consumption from the radios performing data
transmission, all while the Android OS believed the devices were
silent in airplane mode.
[informative interlude: software defined transceivers should be in
every hacker toolbox; radio level attacks are otherwise invisible to
you. they are also useful for many other purposes, perhaps one day
even providing a solution to the untrustworthy proprietary firmware
and baseband systems crammed into every mobile device these days.]
incidentally, this also demonstrates why IOMMU / VT-d guest isolation
of devices on the host bus is very useful, as a vulnerable NIC could
otherwise provide complete access to privileged memory and interfaces
just like the baseband exploit above...  assuming your CPU itself is
"trusting trust" continues to be a persistent and difficult problem,
leaving us all vulnerable to some degree or another - it's just a
function of cost and skill to compromise.  turtles all the way down!

"I'm sorry. My responses are limited. You must ask the right questions."
weaponized baseband exploits are difficult, expensive, architecture
specific, and not used capriciously.
this, among other reasons, is why there is such a dearth of
information on them despite being proven exploitable with a wide
attack surface for many years.
Rupp said state-sponsored attackers are already using baseband
processor attacks in airports but declined to go into details beyond
saying that attacks could be carried out without the need to trick
smartphones owners into opening an email or visiting a malicious
website. Attacks might involve building a rogue GSM base-station from
commodity hardware or run from the infrastructure of a 'co-operative"
telco. It might also be possible to run attacks against baseband
processors of phones using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth interfaces, according to
GSMK Cryptophone.
"Once you have control over the app CPU, you can in principle use that
to load any code you want from the network," Rupp explained. "Since
you have already successfully escalated your privileges on the system,
no user interaction is necessary."

cpunks it is a question of private vs. public communication.
email is and will continue to be useful for public communication. this
gmail account indexes 190+ lists, 10,000 news alerts from scores of
filters (everything from "TS//SI//NF" to "Flame OR Gauss OR Duqu OR
Stuxnet" to Goldreich–Goldwasser–Halevi), a total of 643,132 pieces of
communication. i can search through all of it in seconds and apply new
filters to existing content just as easily as new, and keep an offline
backup just in case.
but there is zero i would consider private; for that use a medium of
communication that is not a usability failure, that is not a metadata
leakage nightmare, that is not an operational security mine field.

and to StealthMonger's point about latest generation mix networks for
best privacy, why not instead focus on building low latency protocols
that are resistant to traffic analysis and confirmation?
make them datagram based; utilize user space stacks and latest
research.  solving the low latency datagram anonymity problem enables
existing usable private communication with the additional benefit of
endpoint and peer anonymity.
i believe this possible to make useful, even if never infallible.
certainly more possible than the odds of making truly scalable,
available, and _usable_ mix mailer networks and clients for the
most important: make this low latency infrastructure usable and cross
platform, so the implementations are easily adopted... like Napster

the best kind of problems!
correct. i mention them as a prerequisite for both protection and usability.
protection for example, with end-to-end SCTP multi-homed endpoints via
userspace stacks would avoid predecessor attacks - if you block one
route there are others which transit traffic, maintaining an
uninterrupted session across otherwise individually volatile paths.
usability for example to support UDP traffic and applications which
are not currently served via TCP and connection oriented services.
sadly, even TCP re-invented in user space is insufficient. you want a
specific protocol implementation of multi-homed SCTP in userspace,
probably on top of other protocol supports like LEDBAT or AQM. perhaps
using ORCHID IPv6 identifiers for endpoint addressing. lot's of
options; and as you said: it's a hard problem!
this is a separate problem. for the core transport encapsulation in
UDP may be sufficient. for censorship avoidance you will likely need
to bounce over a DUST like path first to access such an anonymizing
network. topology is an interesting subject, as the design must be
decentralized but may not need to be homogenous.
you want variable latency at the datagram level (e.g. stochastic
reordering and shaping of traffic, with prioritization done at the
endpoint where flows are visible.) more than the utmost in
performance. as long as it is overall TCP fair of course :)
and this is just the start. we haven't touched on network discovery,
path awareness/selection/weighting, etc.  as you said, hard problems;
the best kind of problems!

@_author: coderman 
@_subject: UDP/datagram/cell based networks [was: Why_can't_email_be_secure] 
i should clarify:
the mode of operation for this presumed design and implementation is
to have SOCKS, HTTP, HTTPS, transparent UDP, transparent TCP,
transparent DNS (this is indeed different than just UDP :), and some
subset of transparent ICMP proxy support on the client / node.  you
could configure proxy settings, direct traffic to the trans ports, or
perform queries directly against the DNS port of the running real time
datagram mixer instance.
at the exits for public traffic or at the private ORCHID based
"hidden/overlay" endpoints, you transit these same protocols, per
advertised support in exit policy or overlay service capability
on the wire, you would be sending UDP datagrams that encapsulate the
NAT busting IPsec telescope containing path data, multi-path SCTP in
userspace for reliable TCP stream transport over the datagram overlay.
for all intents and purposes these packets would look like AH/ESP or
CryptoBox wrapped opaque cipher texts in some standard UDP
as for ATM, SONET, satellite data terminals, metro wireless, and all
other unusual or exotic transports: these are likely not useful for
the core network unless directly public UDP IPv4 reachable.
censorship bypass, non-node capable devices like phones, or very poor
network connectivity situations, would require other transports and
protocols for this initial tunnel into the overall real-time datagram
mix-like network.  in this context, the varied physical layers and
logical paths in a given metro region operating beneath IP routing can
play a role in passing traffic from suppressed/blocked users out to
the broader mesh or internet at large.
devices and users communicating via obfuscated links into the dgm
network do not have traffic analysis protections like full
participants.  despite this lack of stronger anonymity, the actors
observing at the edge can only note that you are tunneling into the
public network, and utilizing some stochastic gradient of bandwidth in
aggregate for some period of time.
this is still not much information, especially compared to the current
state of affairs!
there are many complications and constraints around how this would
work - i make it sound so easy ;)
  however, you could provide such services, including wireless metro
area mesh or p-to-mp distribution networks, constrained by propinquity
and referral by reputation, in combination with broadband internet
uplink of a more traditional sort where available.
and in fact, using multiple paths / transports concurrently provides
advantage for data continuity and throughput despite volatile and
changing upstream link availability on an individual basis to
particular gateway or router or access point devices.
metro area mesh benefits nicely from some backhaul ad-hoc or fixed
plant high capacity point-to-point links over distance with short IP
routes; there is a good paper from early 2000's about using atheros
802.11a devices with a custom tertiary firmware and host driver to
bond eight devices into a single point-to-point link with an aggregate
throughput over three or four hundred megabit a second in transport
rate... or so i recall.  IPoATM on a OC12 or bigger to an internet
provider would absolutely be useful as an upstream sink within such a
i would love to see high degree mesh optimizer p-to-mp nodes applying
the latest high bit rate software defines radios for  backhaul and
security.  isolate each radio like a Pervices Noctar[0] or USRP B210
[1] into its own guest and isolate devices with VT-d enforced memory
access boundaries.  you may even put more than one device in a single
SDR Backhaul Guest VM if doing large-QAM or other complex MIMO
front-ends and signal processing.

i should have mentioned:
metro Ethernet or municipal run fiber networks with peering are the
best option for mesh traffic relaying like this. ATM is too expensive;
IDSN, despite a proud origin story of the first data mix networks, is
also expensive, and super slow.
get rooftop access for radios in a Fresnel friendly internet exchange
where you can simply forward traffic down a few floors over Ethernet
and you're in the best of positions.
consumer fiber to the home would be great, if ToS restrictions didn't
make such forwarding risky.  and the business upgrade for FTTP is
pretty outrageous in almost every case.
you could route through a VPN provider or dedi server of your own in
this case, but tunneling may not be sufficiently covert depending on
the amount of bandwidth used.

active attacks are often even more effective at rapid traffic
confirmation and analysis[0]; GPA is pretty tame perhaps!
in any case the challenge you mention: thwarting or preventing traffic
analysis without a full mix of constant traffic. if the datagram based
system above existed, combine with:
- stochastic fair queuing and re-ordering of egress traffic. by
"clamping" the outbound rate of randomized, re-ordered datagrams to a
broad "size/chunk" of capacity, you deter traffic confirmation,
anonymity set reduction, and other traffic analysis attacks of various
- client-side classification of application traffic into prioritized
classes[1] for ingress / dgm proxy level active shaping by classful
HTB queues before transiting the first hop and losing all visibility
into the content and priority of message payloads.
- integrate a lowest effort / unreliable background reliable multicast
like bulk transport channel for resource and key pre-caching, network
participant and performance information distribution, secure remote
archives, random performance measurement/tests across peer groups,
other low priority communications suited for this "filler" class of
traffic. (consuming more or less filler traffic helps smooth out the
effective throughput and efficiency when changing the broad
"stochastic traffic capacity range" appropriate for a given peer.)
- provide LEDBAT or AQM management of edge traffic to upstream(s) to
prevent unnecessary latency in upstream buffers. this ensures that
even at full utilization the responsiveness of the broadband link is
- and the multi-path SCTP, IPsec, UDP NAT traversal and encapsulation,
and other user space network stacks communicating across this overlay
network as discussed above for requisite application and control
communication support.
these techniques combined allow you to use still not insignificant
"stochastic traffic capacity ranges" instead of a constant fixed
amount of traffic to protect against these attacks.  these stochastic
ranges can be adjusted up or down as network performance and capacity
dictate. this protocol provides congestion control and TCP
friendliness while greatly reducing the amount of bandwidth consumed
relative to a traditional mix.
at best (in theory), an attacker with local active and global passive
methods on hand could discern anonymity sets for broad categories /
scales of possible communication usage.  E.g. anon set A exhibits
traffic utilization on the order of 1Mbps to 5Mbps, while anon set B
exhibits traffic utilization on the order of 5Mbps to 50Mbps, and anon
set C exhibits traffic utilization on the order of 50Mbps to 1Gbps,
given this drawback, code a kick ass client with participation enabled
by default if sufficient connectivity and resources are available.
you've now made these broad traffic volume sets nearly useless in a
practical / actionable sense.
congratulations! you've now got a traffic analysis resistant low
latency anonymity protocol, implementation, and network that nearly
anyone can participate in and contribute to. for my next magic hand
wave, a directory / route selection method that scales to billions of
peers while leveraging geographic propinquity and social peer groups
to constrain Sybil attacks and impact of bad actors.
next grow network capacity in a way that continually applies implicit
feedback from the network overall and peers directly and your
deterrence to these attacks begins to improve further over time,
perhaps even one day hitting a tipping point of prevalence and
persistence for de-facto victory in most threat models...
we can dream!
perhaps someone should toss up a Bitcoin donation address to support
work on detailed technical specifications, experimental prototypes,
maintaining clouds for continuous builds, regression checks, load
tests, and traffic analysis for quality measurement and security
could also use donations for bounties for identifying or exploiting
security or privacy vulnerabilities in the design and implementation
of this final generation anonymous network.  whoever sets this up
should probably use an onion to coordinate development and distribute
sources, other resources...
calling all "tup" s, ...  ;P
0. "From a Trickle to a Flood: Active Attacks on Several Mix Types"
  1. i have mentioned the following classes before, with each in
priority order for the HTB prioritization / shaping before traffic
enters the network and becomes opaque:
 a. control and signalling traffic - always takes precedence.
 b. real-time and interactive communications, but not video.
 c. real-time video communication, if applicable.
 d. low priority bulk communication.  torrents, archives, opportunistic caching
 e. filler / last-tier best effort unreliable traffic as mentioned
above for filling in the remaining capacity at the current stochastic
rx/tx rate center point.
2.  instead of trying to research and author formal proofs of entropy
bounds for various idealized models, cut straight to the chase and
build the most aggressive, best in class developmental learning / deep
learning systems for classification and identification of nodes,
flows, protocols, identities in a test bed setup that provides full
traffic visibility and active client edge MitM capability (E.g.
simulate attack via rogue AP or cell tower for tagging? selective DoS?
others,).  malicious attacks performed by the remote end or injected
by remote's upstream are not in scope for this traffic analysis and
privacy assessment. however, passive capture of all exit
communications and ORCHID hidden endpoint communications is in scope
for analysis.
then, see how effective this best scenario and tools attack is against
a running implementation.  did it fail catastrophically in flames or
break wide open with trivial effort?  keep improving...
respectably hardened against the most aggressive machine learning and
malicious active attacks you could conceive of and build?  great! have

of the 1.6% of the data, only 0.025% is actually selected for review.
The net effect is that NSA
analysts look at 0.00004% of the world's traffic in conducting their
mission - that's less than one
part in a million. Put another way, if a standard basketball court
represented the global
communications environment, NSA's total collection would be
represented by an area smaller than a
dime on that basketball court.
again we see the fallacy of "not a search/collection until reviewed by
an analyst."...

i've been contemplating a write up about this, but the problem is once
you advertise your methods they become less effective.
there really is "security through obscurity" in this sense; when at a
resource disadvantage, every little bit counts...
if i were to summarize what i have found effective against dedicated
and resourceful attackers (again, i can't go into details :) this
would be the top 5:
1. use a common distro, but rebuild critical components - bootloader,
initramfs, openssl, openssh, the kernel, gnutls, libgmp, use 64bit,
2. use isolation and RBAC, Qubes, VirtualBox, VMWare, Parallels,
remember that VM escapes are available and expected. defense in depth
can never be too deep.
3. use constrained network access - identify anomalies, control
bandwidth, firewall ingress and egress aggressively. this implies
constant monitoring to detect such events. (another exercise left to
the reader)
4. rootkit and backdoor your own systems - use the dirty tricks to
observe and constrain your system before someone else uses dirty
tricks to compromise your system.
5. don't forget physical security - this is the universal oversight
and most effective end run around all other operational and technical
security measures. there is a reason physical access so often implies
"game over" and why black bag jobs are still and will continue to be
effective against all targets.

some questions, some answers, ...
this means rebuild hardened versions of these libraries from source;
  excluding insecure cipher suites in an OpenSSL build for example,
  altering architecture optimizations, supported features, in others,
the goal being that an exploit targeted to a vanilla distribution will
more likely fail with observable error or crash, rather than succeed
many exploits are very brittle in this respect, with any change in
symbol offsets or capabilities rendering them completely ineffective.
virtualization implies chained exploits for full compromise. combined
with the above you've drastically increased the cost of a successful
attack with modest effort. the likelihood of detection (by appearing
vulnerable yet not being so) is also increased.
remember that VMMs and hypervisors are themselves potentially
vulnerable software systems suitable for hardening and customization.
data exfiltration can be very visible via network behavior if you're
paying attention.  cross referencing connection state in your upstream
router vs. local OS view of sockets can identify discrepancies where
compromise has concealed covert connections. malware communicating
directly on an ethernet or wireless adapter outside of the OS is also
visible at this junction.
this is mostly a variant of  at a kernel / system level.  like
notepad.exe connecting to the internet, there are some syscall, file
access, and network requests which are clearly anomalous and
indicators of compromise.
this is a storied tangent unto itself...
last but not least: you must develop a routine of continuous hardening
and improvement. these steps are not done once and finished; they are
elements within a larger strategy of operational rigor defending
against motivated and capable attackers. asking for my "hardened linux
build" is missing the point entirely!

one last cautionary tale:
some time back i used the techniques discussed to harden some Android
phones brought with me into a hostile environment. i had kernel level
protections in place, hardened the system configuration and services,
pared down apps to the minimum and constrained their access to the
file system and network. this was months of effort.
the first adversarial encounter went very well in my favor - all of
the attempts to exploit my devices were thwarted at these various
layers and via these protections, with the sole exception of a Google
Voice Search hack that kept voice search active in an "open mic night"
eavesdropping capability.  this was quickly nullified via kill -STOP
(Android won't re-spawn an app that is already running, and a stopped
process proved quite effective at halting this repeated invocation of
search used to capture audio.)
fast forward to round two, and i doubled down on the kernel, system,
and application level protections. even more scrutiny is applied to
applications to avoid the misuse of legitimate functionality for
malicious purpose.  i am feeling confident!
... and then a baseband exploit easily walks under all of my
protections at every layer, completely and fully 0wning my devices,
with the only hint at anything amiss being the elevated thermal
dissipation and power consumption from the radios performing data
transmission, all while the Android OS believed the devices were
silent in airplane mode.
[informative interlude: software defined transceivers should be in
every hacker toolbox; radio level attacks are otherwise invisible to
you. they are also useful for many other purposes, perhaps one day
even providing a solution to the untrustworthy proprietary firmware
and baseband systems crammed into every mobile device these days.]
incidentally, this also demonstrates why IOMMU / VT-d guest isolation
of devices on the host bus is very useful, as a vulnerable NIC could
otherwise provide complete access to privileged memory and interfaces
just like the baseband exploit above...  assuming your CPU itself is
"trusting trust" continues to be a persistent and difficult problem,
leaving us all vulnerable to some degree or another - it's just a
function of cost and skill to compromise.  turtles all the way down!

"I'm sorry. My responses are limited. You must ask the right questions."
weaponized baseband exploits are difficult, expensive, architecture
specific, and not used capriciously.
this, among other reasons, is why there is such a dearth of
information on them despite being proven exploitable with a wide
attack surface for many years.
Rupp said state-sponsored attackers are already using baseband
processor attacks in airports but declined to go into details beyond
saying that attacks could be carried out without the need to trick
smartphones owners into opening an email or visiting a malicious
website. Attacks might involve building a rogue GSM base-station from
commodity hardware or run from the infrastructure of a 'co-operative"
telco. It might also be possible to run attacks against baseband
processors of phones using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth interfaces, according to
GSMK Cryptophone.
"Once you have control over the app CPU, you can in principle use that
to load any code you want from the network," Rupp explained. "Since
you have already successfully escalated your privileges on the system,
no user interaction is necessary."

cpunks it is a question of private vs. public communication.
email is and will continue to be useful for public communication. this
gmail account indexes 190+ lists, 10,000 news alerts from scores of
filters (everything from "TS//SI//NF" to "Flame OR Gauss OR Duqu OR
Stuxnet" to Goldreich–Goldwasser–Halevi), a total of 643,132 pieces of
communication. i can search through all of it in seconds and apply new
filters to existing content just as easily as new, and keep an offline
backup just in case.
but there is zero i would consider private; for that use a medium of

and to StealthMonger's point about latest generation mix networks for
best privacy, why not instead focus on building low latency protocols
that are resistant to traffic analysis and confirmation?
make them datagram based; utilize user space stacks and latest
research.  solving the low latency datagram anonymity problem enables
existing usable private communication with the additional benefit of
endpoint and peer anonymity.
i believe this possible to make useful, even if never infallible.
certainly more possible than the odds of making truly scalable,

the best kind of problems!
correct. i mention them as a prerequisite for both protection and usability.
protection for example, with end-to-end SCTP multi-homed endpoints via
userspace stacks would avoid predecessor attacks - if you block one
route there are others which transit traffic, maintaining an
uninterrupted session across otherwise individually volatile paths.
usability for example to support UDP traffic and applications which
are not currently served via TCP and connection oriented services.
sadly, even TCP re-invented in user space is insufficient. you want a
specific protocol implementation of multi-homed SCTP in userspace,
probably on top of other protocol supports like LEDBAT or AQM. perhaps
using ORCHID IPv6 identifiers for endpoint addressing. lot's of
options; and as you said: it's a hard problem!
this is a separate problem. for the core transport encapsulation in
UDP may be sufficient. for censorship avoidance you will likely need
to bounce over a DUST like path first to access such an anonymizing
network. topology is an interesting subject, as the design must be
decentralized but may not need to be homogenous.
you want variable latency at the datagram level (e.g. stochastic
reordering and shaping of traffic, with prioritization done at the
endpoint where flows are visible.) more than the utmost in
performance. as long as it is overall TCP fair of course :)
and this is just the start. we haven't touched on network discovery,
path awareness/selection/weighting, etc.  as you said, hard problems;
the best kind of problems!

@_author: coderman 
@_subject: UDP/datagram/cell based networks [was: Why_can't_email_be_secure] 
i should clarify:
the mode of operation for this presumed design and implementation is
to have SOCKS, HTTP, HTTPS, transparent UDP, transparent TCP,
transparent DNS (this is indeed different than just UDP :), and some
subset of transparent ICMP proxy support on the client / node.  you
could configure proxy settings, direct traffic to the trans ports, or
perform queries directly against the DNS port of the running real time
datagram mixer instance.
at the exits for public traffic or at the private ORCHID based
"hidden/overlay" endpoints, you transit these same protocols, per
advertised support in exit policy or overlay service capability
on the wire, you would be sending UDP datagrams that encapsulate the
NAT busting IPsec telescope containing path data, multi-path SCTP in
userspace for reliable TCP stream transport over the datagram overlay.
for all intents and purposes these packets would look like AH/ESP or
CryptoBox wrapped opaque cipher texts in some standard UDP
as for ATM, SONET, satellite data terminals, metro wireless, and all
other unusual or exotic transports: these are likely not useful for
the core network unless directly public UDP IPv4 reachable.
censorship bypass, non-node capable devices like phones, or very poor
network connectivity situations, would require other transports and
protocols for this initial tunnel into the overall real-time datagram
mix-like network.  in this context, the varied physical layers and
logical paths in a given metro region operating beneath IP routing can
play a role in passing traffic from suppressed/blocked users out to
the broader mesh or internet at large.
devices and users communicating via obfuscated links into the dgm
network do not have traffic analysis protections like full
participants.  despite this lack of stronger anonymity, the actors
observing at the edge can only note that you are tunneling into the
public network, and utilizing some stochastic gradient of bandwidth in
aggregate for some period of time.
this is still not much information, especially compared to the current
state of affairs!
there are many complications and constraints around how this would
work - i make it sound so easy ;)
  however, you could provide such services, including wireless metro
area mesh or p-to-mp distribution networks, constrained by propinquity
and referral by reputation, in combination with broadband internet
uplink of a more traditional sort where available.
and in fact, using multiple paths / transports concurrently provides
advantage for data continuity and throughput despite volatile and
changing upstream link availability on an individual basis to
particular gateway or router or access point devices.
metro area mesh benefits nicely from some backhaul ad-hoc or fixed
plant high capacity point-to-point links over distance with short IP
routes; there is a good paper from early 2000's about using atheros
802.11a devices with a custom tertiary firmware and host driver to
bond eight devices into a single point-to-point link with an aggregate
throughput over three or four hundred megabit a second in transport
rate... or so i recall.  IPoATM on a OC12 or bigger to an internet
provider would absolutely be useful as an upstream sink within such a
i would love to see high degree mesh optimizer p-to-mp nodes applying
the latest high bit rate software defines radios for  backhaul and
security.  isolate each radio like a Pervices Noctar[0] or USRP B210
[1] into its own guest and isolate devices with VT-d enforced memory
access boundaries.  you may even put more than one device in a single
SDR Backhaul Guest VM if doing large-QAM or other complex MIMO
front-ends and signal processing.

i should have mentioned:
metro Ethernet or municipal run fiber networks with peering are the
best option for mesh traffic relaying like this. ATM is too expensive;
IDSN, despite a proud origin story of the first data mix networks, is
also expensive, and super slow.
get rooftop access for radios in a Fresnel friendly internet exchange
where you can simply forward traffic down a few floors over Ethernet
and you're in the best of positions.
consumer fiber to the home would be great, if ToS restrictions didn't
make such forwarding risky.  and the business upgrade for FTTP is
pretty outrageous in almost every case.
you could route through a VPN provider or dedi server of your own in
this case, but tunneling may not be sufficiently covert depending on

active attacks are often even more effective at rapid traffic
confirmation and analysis[0]; GPA is pretty tame perhaps!
in any case the challenge you mention: thwarting or preventing traffic
analysis without a full mix of constant traffic. if the datagram based
system above existed, combine with:
- stochastic fair queuing and re-ordering of egress traffic. by
"clamping" the outbound rate of randomized, re-ordered datagrams to a
broad "size/chunk" of capacity, you deter traffic confirmation,
anonymity set reduction, and other traffic analysis attacks of various
- client-side classification of application traffic into prioritized
classes[1] for ingress / dgm proxy level active shaping by classful
HTB queues before transiting the first hop and losing all visibility
into the content and priority of message payloads.
- integrate a lowest effort / unreliable background reliable multicast
like bulk transport channel for resource and key pre-caching, network
participant and performance information distribution, secure remote
archives, random performance measurement/tests across peer groups,
other low priority communications suited for this "filler" class of
traffic. (consuming more or less filler traffic helps smooth out the
effective throughput and efficiency when changing the broad
"stochastic traffic capacity range" appropriate for a given peer.)
- provide LEDBAT or AQM management of edge traffic to upstream(s) to
prevent unnecessary latency in upstream buffers. this ensures that
even at full utilization the responsiveness of the broadband link is
- and the multi-path SCTP, IPsec, UDP NAT traversal and encapsulation,
and other user space network stacks communicating across this overlay
network as discussed above for requisite application and control
communication support.
these techniques combined allow you to use still not insignificant
"stochastic traffic capacity ranges" instead of a constant fixed
amount of traffic to protect against these attacks.  these stochastic
ranges can be adjusted up or down as network performance and capacity
dictate. this protocol provides congestion control and TCP
friendliness while greatly reducing the amount of bandwidth consumed
relative to a traditional mix.
at best (in theory), an attacker with local active and global passive
methods on hand could discern anonymity sets for broad categories /
scales of possible communication usage.  E.g. anon set A exhibits
traffic utilization on the order of 1Mbps to 5Mbps, while anon set B
exhibits traffic utilization on the order of 5Mbps to 50Mbps, and anon
set C exhibits traffic utilization on the order of 50Mbps to 1Gbps,
given this drawback, code a kick ass client with participation enabled
by default if sufficient connectivity and resources are available.
you've now made these broad traffic volume sets nearly useless in a
practical / actionable sense.
congratulations! you've now got a traffic analysis resistant low
latency anonymity protocol, implementation, and network that nearly
anyone can participate in and contribute to. for my next magic hand
wave, a directory / route selection method that scales to billions of
peers while leveraging geographic propinquity and social peer groups
to constrain Sybil attacks and impact of bad actors.
next grow network capacity in a way that continually applies implicit
feedback from the network overall and peers directly and your
deterrence to these attacks begins to improve further over time,
perhaps even one day hitting a tipping point of prevalence and
persistence for de-facto victory in most threat models...
we can dream!
perhaps someone should toss up a Bitcoin donation address to support
work on detailed technical specifications, experimental prototypes,
maintaining clouds for continuous builds, regression checks, load
tests, and traffic analysis for quality measurement and security
could also use donations for bounties for identifying or exploiting
security or privacy vulnerabilities in the design and implementation
of this final generation anonymous network.  whoever sets this up
should probably use an onion to coordinate development and distribute
sources, other resources...

 b. real-time and interactive communications, but not video.
 c. real-time video communication, if applicable.

by remote's upstream are not in scope for this traffic analysis and

it is related to the list in the sense of embracing epithets and
culling the useless.
you've provided this reasoning in measured fashion and various tone
repeatedly; believe me when i say i understand exactly what you are
concerned about and why you consider this unreasonable.
let me be equally clear: cryptography, privacy, and anonymity
discussions under any name and forum are appropriate. to censor the
medium or message out of fear of misunderstanding is akin to never
exercising rights and liberties for fear they may cause scrutiny and
if this is you: so concerned about unwanted attention, that you'll
always consent to a search of your person without resistance, that
you'll always hand over keys to your system or provide access to your
devices and equipment upon mere request, perhaps when crossing
borders, just so you avoid "trouble".
if this is you: what the fuck are you doing on a cypherpunks list?
cypherpunks write code, especially privacy and anonymity code, which
is a much more contentious endeavor than what you are cowed by.  this
is an impasse, where we agree to disagree.

you'll always hand over keys to your system or provide access to your

cypherpunks write code, especially privacy and anonymity code, which

i've been contemplating a write up about this, but the problem is once
you advertise your methods they become less effective.
there really is "security through obscurity" in this sense; when at a
resource disadvantage, every little bit counts...
if i were to summarize what i have found effective against dedicated
and resourceful attackers (again, i can't go into details :) this
would be the top 5:
1. use a common distro, but rebuild critical components - bootloader,
initramfs, openssl, openssh, the kernel, gnutls, libgmp, use 64bit,
2. use isolation and RBAC, Qubes, VirtualBox, VMWare, Parallels,
remember that VM escapes are available and expected. defense in depth
can never be too deep.
3. use constrained network access - identify anomalies, control
bandwidth, firewall ingress and egress aggressively. this implies
constant monitoring to detect such events. (another exercise left to
the reader)
4. rootkit and backdoor your own systems - use the dirty tricks to
observe and constrain your system before someone else uses dirty
tricks to compromise your system.
5. don't forget physical security - this is the universal oversight
and most effective end run around all other operational and technical
security measures. there is a reason physical access so often implies
"game over" and why black bag jobs are still and will continue to be
effective against all targets.

some questions, some answers, ...
this means rebuild hardened versions of these libraries from source;
  excluding insecure cipher suites in an OpenSSL build for example,
  altering architecture optimizations, supported features, in others,
the goal being that an exploit targeted to a vanilla distribution will
more likely fail with observable error or crash, rather than succeed
many exploits are very brittle in this respect, with any change in
symbol offsets or capabilities rendering them completely ineffective.
virtualization implies chained exploits for full compromise. combined
with the above you've drastically increased the cost of a successful
attack with modest effort. the likelihood of detection (by appearing
vulnerable yet not being so) is also increased.
remember that VMMs and hypervisors are themselves potentially
vulnerable software systems suitable for hardening and customization.
data exfiltration can be very visible via network behavior if you're
paying attention.  cross referencing connection state in your upstream
router vs. local OS view of sockets can identify discrepancies where
compromise has concealed covert connections. malware communicating
directly on an ethernet or wireless adapter outside of the OS is also
visible at this junction.
this is mostly a variant of  at a kernel / system level.  like
notepad.exe connecting to the internet, there are some syscall, file
access, and network requests which are clearly anomalous and
indicators of compromise.
this is a storied tangent unto itself...
last but not least: you must develop a routine of continuous hardening
and improvement. these steps are not done once and finished; they are
elements within a larger strategy of operational rigor defending
against motivated and capable attackers. asking for my "hardened linux
build" is missing the point entirely!

@_subject: Lavabit and End-point Security 
one last cautionary tale:
some time back i used the techniques discussed to harden some Android
phones brought with me into a hostile environment. i had kernel level
protections in place, hardened the system configuration and services,
pared down apps to the minimum and constrained their access to the
file system and network. this was months of effort.
the first adversarial encounter went very well in my favor - all of
the attempts to exploit my devices were thwarted at these various
layers and via these protections, with the sole exception of a Google
Voice Search hack that kept voice search active in an "open mic night"
eavesdropping capability.  this was quickly nullified via kill -STOP
(Android won't re-spawn an app that is already running, and a stopped
process proved quite effective at halting this repeated invocation of
search used to capture audio.)
fast forward to round two, and i doubled down on the kernel, system,
and application level protections. even more scrutiny is applied to
applications to avoid the misuse of legitimate functionality for
malicious purpose.  i am feeling confident!
... and then a baseband exploit easily walks under all of my
protections at every layer, completely and fully 0wning my devices,
with the only hint at anything amiss being the elevated thermal
dissipation and power consumption from the radios performing data
transmission, all while the Android OS believed the devices were
silent in airplane mode.
[informative interlude: software defined transceivers should be in
every hacker toolbox; radio level attacks are otherwise invisible to
you. they are also useful for many other purposes, perhaps one day
even providing a solution to the untrustworthy proprietary firmware
and baseband systems crammed into every mobile device these days.]
incidentally, this also demonstrates why IOMMU / VT-d guest isolation
of devices on the host bus is very useful, as a vulnerable NIC could
otherwise provide complete access to privileged memory and interfaces
just like the baseband exploit above...  assuming your CPU itself is
"trusting trust" continues to be a persistent and difficult problem,
leaving us all vulnerable to some degree or another - it's just a
function of cost and skill to compromise.  turtles all the way down!

"I'm sorry. My responses are limited. You must ask the right questions."
weaponized baseband exploits are difficult, expensive, architecture
specific, and not used capriciously.
this, among other reasons, is why there is such a dearth of
information on them despite being proven exploitable with a wide
attack surface for many years.
Rupp said state-sponsored attackers are already using baseband
processor attacks in airports but declined to go into details beyond
saying that attacks could be carried out without the need to trick
smartphones owners into opening an email or visiting a malicious
website. Attacks might involve building a rogue GSM base-station from
commodity hardware or run from the infrastructure of a 'co-operative"
telco. It might also be possible to run attacks against baseband
processors of phones using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth interfaces, according to
GSMK Cryptophone.
"Once you have control over the app CPU, you can in principle use that
to load any code you want from the network," Rupp explained. "Since
you have already successfully escalated your privileges on the system,
no user interaction is necessary."

email is and will continue to be useful for public communication. this
gmail account indexes 190+ lists, 10,000 news alerts from scores of

and to StealthMonger's point about latest generation mix networks for

that are resistant to traffic analysis and confirmation?
make them datagram based; utilize user space stacks and latest
research.  solving the low latency datagram anonymity problem enables
existing usable private communication with the additional benefit of
endpoint and peer anonymity.
i believe this possible to make useful, even if never infallible.
certainly more possible than the odds of making truly scalable,

most important: make this low latency infrastructure usable and cross

the best kind of problems!
correct. i mention them as a prerequisite for both protection and usability.
protection for example, with end-to-end SCTP multi-homed endpoints via
userspace stacks would avoid predecessor attacks - if you block one
route there are others which transit traffic, maintaining an
uninterrupted session across otherwise individually volatile paths.
usability for example to support UDP traffic and applications which
are not currently served via TCP and connection oriented services.
sadly, even TCP re-invented in user space is insufficient. you want a
specific protocol implementation of multi-homed SCTP in userspace,
probably on top of other protocol supports like LEDBAT or AQM. perhaps
using ORCHID IPv6 identifiers for endpoint addressing. lot's of
options; and as you said: it's a hard problem!
this is a separate problem. for the core transport encapsulation in
UDP may be sufficient. for censorship avoidance you will likely need
to bounce over a DUST like path first to access such an anonymizing
network. topology is an interesting subject, as the design must be
decentralized but may not need to be homogenous.
you want variable latency at the datagram level (e.g. stochastic
reordering and shaping of traffic, with prioritization done at the
endpoint where flows are visible.) more than the utmost in
performance. as long as it is overall TCP fair of course :)
and this is just the start. we haven't touched on network discovery,
path awareness/selection/weighting, etc.  as you said, hard problems;
the best kind of problems!

@_subject: UDP/datagram/cell based networks [was: Why_can't_email_be_secure] 
i should clarify:
the mode of operation for this presumed design and implementation is
to have SOCKS, HTTP, HTTPS, transparent UDP, transparent TCP,
transparent DNS (this is indeed different than just UDP :), and some
subset of transparent ICMP proxy support on the client / node.  you
could configure proxy settings, direct traffic to the trans ports, or
perform queries directly against the DNS port of the running real time
datagram mixer instance.
at the exits for public traffic or at the private ORCHID based
"hidden/overlay" endpoints, you transit these same protocols, per
advertised support in exit policy or overlay service capability
on the wire, you would be sending UDP datagrams that encapsulate the
NAT busting IPsec telescope containing path data, multi-path SCTP in
userspace for reliable TCP stream transport over the datagram overlay.
for all intents and purposes these packets would look like AH/ESP or
CryptoBox wrapped opaque cipher texts in some standard UDP
as for ATM, SONET, satellite data terminals, metro wireless, and all
other unusual or exotic transports: these are likely not useful for
the core network unless directly public UDP IPv4 reachable.
censorship bypass, non-node capable devices like phones, or very poor
network connectivity situations, would require other transports and
protocols for this initial tunnel into the overall real-time datagram
mix-like network.  in this context, the varied physical layers and
logical paths in a given metro region operating beneath IP routing can
play a role in passing traffic from suppressed/blocked users out to
the broader mesh or internet at large.
devices and users communicating via obfuscated links into the dgm
network do not have traffic analysis protections like full
participants.  despite this lack of stronger anonymity, the actors
observing at the edge can only note that you are tunneling into the
public network, and utilizing some stochastic gradient of bandwidth in
aggregate for some period of time.
this is still not much information, especially compared to the current
state of affairs!
there are many complications and constraints around how this would
work - i make it sound so easy ;)
  however, you could provide such services, including wireless metro
area mesh or p-to-mp distribution networks, constrained by propinquity
and referral by reputation, in combination with broadband internet
uplink of a more traditional sort where available.
and in fact, using multiple paths / transports concurrently provides
advantage for data continuity and throughput despite volatile and
changing upstream link availability on an individual basis to
particular gateway or router or access point devices.
metro area mesh benefits nicely from some backhaul ad-hoc or fixed
plant high capacity point-to-point links over distance with short IP
routes; there is a good paper from early 2000's about using atheros
802.11a devices with a custom tertiary firmware and host driver to
bond eight devices into a single point-to-point link with an aggregate
throughput over three or four hundred megabit a second in transport
rate... or so i recall.  IPoATM on a OC12 or bigger to an internet
provider would absolutely be useful as an upstream sink within such a
i would love to see high degree mesh optimizer p-to-mp nodes applying
the latest high bit rate software defines radios for  backhaul and
security.  isolate each radio like a Pervices Noctar[0] or USRP B210
[1] into its own guest and isolate devices with VT-d enforced memory
access boundaries.  you may even put more than one device in a single
SDR Backhaul Guest VM if doing large-QAM or other complex MIMO
front-ends and signal processing.

i should have mentioned:
metro Ethernet or municipal run fiber networks with peering are the
best option for mesh traffic relaying like this. ATM is too expensive;
IDSN, despite a proud origin story of the first data mix networks, is
also expensive, and super slow.
get rooftop access for radios in a Fresnel friendly internet exchange
where you can simply forward traffic down a few floors over Ethernet
and you're in the best of positions.
consumer fiber to the home would be great, if ToS restrictions didn't
make such forwarding risky.  and the business upgrade for FTTP is
pretty outrageous in almost every case.
you could route through a VPN provider or dedi server of your own in

active attacks are often even more effective at rapid traffic
confirmation and analysis[0]; GPA is pretty tame perhaps!
in any case the challenge you mention: thwarting or preventing traffic
analysis without a full mix of constant traffic. if the datagram based
system above existed, combine with:
- stochastic fair queuing and re-ordering of egress traffic. by
"clamping" the outbound rate of randomized, re-ordered datagrams to a
broad "size/chunk" of capacity, you deter traffic confirmation,
anonymity set reduction, and other traffic analysis attacks of various
- client-side classification of application traffic into prioritized
classes[1] for ingress / dgm proxy level active shaping by classful
HTB queues before transiting the first hop and losing all visibility
into the content and priority of message payloads.
- integrate a lowest effort / unreliable background reliable multicast
like bulk transport channel for resource and key pre-caching, network
participant and performance information distribution, secure remote
archives, random performance measurement/tests across peer groups,
other low priority communications suited for this "filler" class of
traffic. (consuming more or less filler traffic helps smooth out the
effective throughput and efficiency when changing the broad
"stochastic traffic capacity range" appropriate for a given peer.)
- provide LEDBAT or AQM management of edge traffic to upstream(s) to
prevent unnecessary latency in upstream buffers. this ensures that
even at full utilization the responsiveness of the broadband link is
- and the multi-path SCTP, IPsec, UDP NAT traversal and encapsulation,
and other user space network stacks communicating across this overlay
network as discussed above for requisite application and control
communication support.
these techniques combined allow you to use still not insignificant
"stochastic traffic capacity ranges" instead of a constant fixed
amount of traffic to protect against these attacks.  these stochastic
ranges can be adjusted up or down as network performance and capacity
dictate. this protocol provides congestion control and TCP
friendliness while greatly reducing the amount of bandwidth consumed
relative to a traditional mix.
at best (in theory), an attacker with local active and global passive
methods on hand could discern anonymity sets for broad categories /
scales of possible communication usage.  E.g. anon set A exhibits
traffic utilization on the order of 1Mbps to 5Mbps, while anon set B
exhibits traffic utilization on the order of 5Mbps to 50Mbps, and anon
set C exhibits traffic utilization on the order of 50Mbps to 1Gbps,
given this drawback, code a kick ass client with participation enabled
by default if sufficient connectivity and resources are available.
you've now made these broad traffic volume sets nearly useless in a
practical / actionable sense.
congratulations! you've now got a traffic analysis resistant low
latency anonymity protocol, implementation, and network that nearly
anyone can participate in and contribute to. for my next magic hand
wave, a directory / route selection method that scales to billions of
peers while leveraging geographic propinquity and social peer groups
to constrain Sybil attacks and impact of bad actors.
next grow network capacity in a way that continually applies implicit
feedback from the network overall and peers directly and your
deterrence to these attacks begins to improve further over time,
perhaps even one day hitting a tipping point of prevalence and
persistence for de-facto victory in most threat models...
we can dream!
perhaps someone should toss up a Bitcoin donation address to support
work on detailed technical specifications, experimental prototypes,
maintaining clouds for continuous builds, regression checks, load
tests, and traffic analysis for quality measurement and security
could also use donations for bounties for identifying or exploiting
security or privacy vulnerabilities in the design and implementation
of this final generation anonymous network.  whoever sets this up
should probably use an onion to coordinate development and distribute
sources, other resources...

  1. i have mentioned the following classes before, with each in
priority order for the HTB prioritization / shaping before traffic

 a. control and signalling traffic - always takes precedence.
 b. real-time and interactive communications, but not video.
 c. real-time video communication, if applicable.
 d. low priority bulk communication.  torrents, archives, opportunistic caching
 e. filler / last-tier best effort unreliable traffic as mentioned

traffic visibility and active client edge MitM capability (E.g.

others,).  malicious attacks performed by the remote end or injected
by remote's upstream are not in scope for this traffic analysis and
privacy assessment. however, passive capture of all exit
communications and ORCHID hidden endpoint communications is in scope
for analysis.

if i had a wishlist it would be:
- 64bit CompCert (not just 64bit int support :)
- verified virtualization isolation model (seL4 Qubes like system?)
- verified crypto_sign_edwards25519sha512batch and
crypto_sign_nistp256sha512ecdsa implementations
- verified compression, regexp, and other common libraries that are
useful at the security boundary between isolated domains or
some of the work done for quark might be partially applicable to some
of the above, but most of the verification is browser specific
(related to things like messaging and tab isolation, proper cookie
handling, socket communication, etc.)
where's the github for Coq kernels?
some other good resources:
ProofWeb:  particularly the courses available for the online interface to Coq.
frama-c:  i just came across this, it looks quite useful, but have not used it
in any depth yet...

self-evident *)

abused and widely are commercial services and collaborations and
  where the product is your private information of any sort, that you
usually unwittingly but sometimes capriciously yield to un trustworthy
third parties with little constraint on secondary distribution for
money to further removed stranger parties...
note that fully decentralized, end-to-end secured, with properly
managed keying and sessions capable technologies are resistant to
these third-party weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
crypto and comms and computing technology should not be abandoned en

huge innovation to get from current systems to something effective and

 cpunks regarding the inability for NSA employees to report ethical violations
in a manner that did not assure retribution:
this is actually a somewhat difficult anonymity / privacy question in
the context of highly compartmented information and operations, where
knowledge of a subset of specific details is sufficient to imply
strong suspicion and scrutiny to a very small number of individuals...
... assuming you don't circumvent the apparently mediocre constraints
to this information in the information systems that contain it. ;)
while academically interesting, in all practical terms we should
render this question moot and provide absolute communication
origin[0], destination[1], and content[2] privacy to all network users
in all locations under all circumstances guaranteed by constitutional
law, prosecutorial discretion, and practical realities (read:
implementations resistant to Tailored Access Operations like efforts
(NSA TAO / CNE related programs)
this latter guarantee will require a bit more design, coding and deployment,
 fun problems to solve![3]
1.  "peer communication endpoint privacy" - this is a hard problem.
the existing implementations are not usable and insufficiently large
in anonymity set (too few users): zero knowledge high latency mail
like messaging mixes, even if the twitter mixes are pretty cool.
a proper solution would be datagram based, NAT busting, low latency
(read: sufficiently real-time for video and voice), the majority
protocol across the Internet and local intranets and ad-hoc mesh nets
and other networks,
in an implementation that resists all known general purpose (wide
scale) and specialized (highly targeted and/or weaponized bleeding
edge and/or privileged positioned) attacks.
2. strong encryption like: alligator wrapped forward secrecy intended
streams, and equivalent techniques, solve this problem.
  clearly there is much work to do in the implementation and protocol
side of crypto integrity.  very, very much work...
3. "NSA TAO / CNE related programs" resistance is a very tall bar.

Snowden Says He Took No Secret Files to Russia
By JAMES RISEN
WASHINGTON - Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency
contractor, said in an extensive interview this month that he did not
take any secret N.S.A. documents with him to Russia when he fled there
in June, assuring that Russian intelligence officials could not get
access to them.
Mr. Snowden said he gave all of the classified documents he had
obtained to journalists he met in Hong Kong, before flying to Moscow,
and did not keep any copies for himself. He did not take the files to
Russia because it wouldn't serve the public interest," he said.
"What would be the unique value of personally carrying another copy of
the materials onward?" he added.
He also asserted that he was able to protect the documents from
China's spies because he was familiar with that nation's intelligence
abilities, saying that as an N.S.A. contractor he had targeted Chinese
operations and had taught a course on Chinese
"There's a zero percent chance the Russians or Chinese have received
any documents," he said.
American intelligence officials have expressed grave concern that the
files might have fallen into the hands of foreign intelligence
services, but Mr. Snowden said he believed that the N.S.A. knew he had
not cooperated with the Russians or the Chinese. He said he was
publicly revealing that he no longer had any agency documents to
explain why he was confident that Russia had not gained access to
them. He had been reluctant to disclose that information previously,
he said, for fear of exposing the journalists to greater scrutiny.
In a wide-ranging interview over several days in the last week, Mr.
Snowden offered detailed responses to accusations that have been
leveled against him by American officials and other critics, provided
new insights into why he became disillusioned with the N.S.A. and
decided to disclose the documents, and talked about the international
debate over surveillance that resulted from the revelations. The
interview took place through encrypted online communications.
Mr. Snowden, 30, has been praised by privacy advocates and assailed by
government officials as a traitor who has caused irreparable harm, and
he is facing charges under the Espionage Act for leaking the N.S.A.
documents to the news media. In the interview, he said he believed he
was a whistle-blower who was acting in the nation's best interests by
revealing information about the N.S.A.s surveillance dragnet and huge
collections of communications data, including that of Americans.
He argued that he had helped American national security by prompting a
badly needed public debate about the scope of the intelligence effort.
The secret continuance of these programs represents a far greater
danger than their disclosure," he said. He added that he had been more
concerned that Americans had not been told about the N.S.A.s reach
than he was about any specific surveillance operation.
So long as there's broad support amongst a people, it can be argued
there's a level of legitimacy even to the most invasive and morally
wrong program, as it was an informed and willing decision," he said.
However, programs that are implemented in secret, out of public
oversight, lack that legitimacy, and that's a problem. It also
represents a dangerous normalization of governing in the dark, where
decisions with enormous public impact occur without any public input.
Mr. Snowden said he had never considered defecting while in Hong Kong,
nor in Russia, where he has been permitted to stay for one year. He
said he felt confident that he had kept the documents secure from
Chinese spies, and that the N.S.A. knew he had done so. His last
target while working as an agency contractor was China, he said,
adding that he had had access to every target, every active
operation mounted by the N.S.A. against the Chinese. Full lists of
them, he said.
If that was compromised, he went on, N.S.A. would have set the
table on fire from slamming it so many times in denouncing the damage
it had caused. Yet N.S.A. has not offered a single example of damage
from the leaks. They havent said boo about it except we think,
maybe, have to assume from anonymous and former officials. Not
China is going dark. Not the Chinese military has shut us out.
An N.S.A. spokeswoman did not respond Thursday to a request for
comment on Mr. Snowden's assertions.
Mr. Snowden said his decision to leak N.S.A. documents developed
gradually, dating back at least to his time working as a technician in
the Geneva station of the C.I.A. His experiences there, Mr. Snowden
said, fed his doubts about the intelligence community, while also
convincing him that working through the chain of command would only
lead to retribution.
He disputed an account in The New York Times last week reporting that
a derogatory comment placed in his personnel evaluation while he was
in Geneva was a result of suspicions that he was trying to break in to
classified files to which he was not authorized to have access. (The
C.I.A. later took issue with the description of why he had been
reprimanded.) Mr. Snowden said the comment was placed in his file by a
senior manager seeking to punish him for trying to warn the C.I.A.
about a computer vulnerability.
Mr. Snowden said that in 2008 and 2009, he was working in Geneva as a
telecommunications information systems officer, handling everything
from information technology and computer networks to maintenance of
the heating and air-conditioning systems. He began pushing for a
promotion, but got into what he termed a petty e-mail spat in which
he questioned a senior manager's judgment.
Several months later, Mr. Snowden said, he was writing his annual
self-evaluation when he discovered flaws in the software of the
C.I.A.s personnel Web applications that would make them vulnerable to
hacking. He warned his supervisor, he said, but his boss advised him
to drop the matter and not rock the boat. After a technical team also
brushed him off, he said, his boss finally agreed to allow him to test
the system to prove that it was flawed.
He did so by adding some code and text in a nonmalicious manner=94 to
his evaluation document that showed that the vulnerability existed, he
said. His immediate supervisor signed off on it and sent it through
the system, but a more senior manager the man Mr. Snowden had
challenged earlier was furious and filed a critical comment in Mr.
Snowden's personnel file, he said.
He said he had considered filing a complaint with the C.I.A.=92s
inspector general about what he considered to be a reprisal, adding
that he could not recall whether he had done so or a supervisor had
talked him out of it. A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment on Mr.
Snowden's account of the episode or whether he had filed a complaint.
But the incident, Mr. Snowden said, convinced him that trying to work
through the system would only lead to punishment. He said he knew of
others who suffered reprisals for what they had exposed, including
Thomas A. Drake, who was prosecuted for disclosing N.S.A. contracting
abuses to The Baltimore Sun. (He met with Mr. Snowden in Moscow last
week to present an award to him for his actions.) And he knew other
N.S.A. employees who had gotten into trouble for embarrassing a senior
official in an e-mail chain that included a line, referring to the
Chinese Army, that said, Is this the P.L.A. or the N.S.A.?
Mr. Snowden added that inside the spy agency theres a lot of dissent
 palpable with some, even. But he said that people were kept in line
through fear and a false image of patriotism, which he described as
obedience to authority.
He said he believed that if he tried to question the N.S.A.s
surveillance operations as an insider, his efforts would have been
buried forever, and he would have been discredited and ruined.=94 He
said that the system does not work, adding that you have to report
wrongdoing to those most responsible for it.
Mr. Snowden said he finally decided to act when he discovered a copy
of a classified 2009 inspector generals report on the N.S.A.s
warrantless wiretapping program during the Bush administration. He
said he found the document through a dirty word search, which he
described as an effort by a systems administrator to check a computer
system for things that should not be there in order to delete them and
sanitize the system.
"It was too highly classified to be where it was," he said of the
report. He opened the document to make certain that it did not belong
there, and after he saw what it revealed, curiosity prevailed, he
After reading about the program, which skirted the existing
surveillance laws, he concluded that it had been illegal, he said. =93If
the highest officials in government can break the law without fearing
punishment or even any repercussions at all, he said, secret powers
become tremendously dangerous.
He would not say exactly when he read the report, or discuss the
timing of his subsequent actions to collect N.S.A. documents in order
to leak them. But he said that reading the report helped crystallize
his decision. You cant read something like that and not realize what
it means for all of these systems we have," he said.
Mr. Snowden said that the impact of his decision to disclose
information about the N.S.A. had been bigger than he had anticipated.
He added that he did not control what the journalists who had the
documents wrote about. He said that he handed over the documents to
them because he wanted his own bias divorced from the decision-making
of publication, and that technical solutions were in place to ensure
the work of the journalists couldn't be interfered with."
Mr. Snowden declined to provide details about his living conditions in
Moscow, except to say that he was not under Russian government control
and was free to move around.

in addition to legal protections, educational support, and competitive programs,
also provide:
- direct and unrestricted backbone access to various individuals or
groups who demonstrate competence in either the educational or
competitive realms, in order for them to mount additional attack
strategies against any reach-able target.  this access must consist of
both passive taps of backbone traffic as well as injection taps for
raw packet transmission at core rates. this should be available on the
Internet backbone at internet exchanges, private fiber through public
right of way, and core networks of operators of licensed wireless
a side benefit of implementing these reforms would be the de-facto
de-funding of offensive network operations by third parties or
governments. the cost to keep ahead of such a widespread, popular, and
distributed effort would be enormous, and provide continually
decreasing returns.

of course; the complete details will be slow to arrive, not least
because detailed description requires a demonstration in a
reproduction test setup, rather than reporting of actual traffic. :/
that said, useful aspects i'll certainly provide on whim or request.
the defining characteristics of the two types of attacks:
DC19 with DRT:
- "high power on-site", less descriminant attacks. target by and
limited to location.
- MitM for system, application, and protocol level attacks. Evilgrade,
MasterKey vulns, etc.  mostly known and a few 0day escalated attacks.
- favorite attack: "Google Voice Search" always-on eavesdropper
payload; Speex voice from all audible participants.
DC20 with Alexander's toys:
- "in the towers", highly targeted to specific devices, active over
wide metro area.
- baseband exploit vector for device key retrieval, memory and storage
forensics, exfiltration.
- PDoS attacks (bricked secondary devices used as fall back once
identified by call graph; ~20 hours)
- favorite attack: baseband pwn in airplane mode, with ex-filtration
over custom channel.
DC21: no appearance (observed).  speculation ongoing...
reversing attacker capabilities, toolkits, TTPs, humanpower/hours, a
much longer tangent.  but this assertion is based on correlation of
the observed power, capacity, and protocols in specific bands
implemented by the attacker with the capabilities of the DRT system.
multiple locations, terabytes of captured spectrum, patience and
as for who was operating it - unknown beyond the usual suspects, which
is a small set due to the restricted distribution of both the hardware
platform and the exploit kit atop it :)
i'll send more details once available.  the details and distribution
to be part of a separate FOIPA effort for US citizen security

thought provoking read, as always. thanks Dan :)
this is worth posting whole, particularly this observation:
... polarization has come to cyber
security.  High end practice is accelerating away from the low end.
The best skills are now astonishingly good while the great mass of
those dependent on cyber security are ever less able to even estimate
what it is that they do not know, much less act on it.  This
polarization is driven by the fundamental strategic asymmetry of
cyber security, namely that while the workfactor for the offender
is the incremental price of finding a new method of attack, the
workfactor for the defender is the cumulative cost of forever
defending against all attack methods yet discovered.  Over time,
the curve for the cost of finding a new attack and the curve for
the cost of defending against all attacks to date must cross.  Once
those curves cross, the offender never has to worry about being out
of the money.  That crossing event occurred some time ago.
i do have one comment, per:
Everyone my age working in cyber security was trained for something
else, and because of that switch between one field and another
brings along the hybrid vigor of seeing the cyber security world
through a different lens.
instead of having a "cyber security" profession, all aspects of
"information security", "software security", or "cyber security" as a
specialization should not exist.  competence and experience with these
subjects should be considered part of routine software and systems
development practice. (right now this is mostly impractical, however,
it need not always be so...)

.Trends in Cyber Security
.Dan Geer, 6 November 13, NRO
Thank you for the invitation to speak with you today, which, let
me be clear, is me speaking as myself and not for anybody or anything
else.  As you know, I work the cyber security trade, that is to say
that my occupation is cyber security.  Note that I said "occupation"
rather than "profession."  On 18 September, the U.S. National Academy
of Sciences, on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security,
concluded that cyber security should be seen as an occupation and
not a profession because the rate of change is too great to consider
professionalization.[1]  You may well agree that that rate of change
is paramount and thus why cyber security is the most intellectually
demanding occupation on the planet.  In writing this essay, I will
keep my comments to trends rather than point estimates, just as you
asked in your invitation, but let me emphasize the wisdom of your
request by noting that the faster the rate of change, the more it
is trends that matter and not the value of any given variable at
any given time.  With luck, each of these trends will not be something
that you would argue with as a trend.  Argument, if any, will be
in their interpretation.
Note also that these trends do not constitute a set of mutually
exclusive, collectively exhaustive characterizations of the space
in which we live and work.  Some of them are correlated with others.
Some of them are newly emergent, some not.  Some of them are
reversible to a degree; some not reversible at all.  I am not, today
anyway, looking for causality.
Trend  Polarization
Much has been written about the increasing polarization of American
life.[2]  The middle is getting smaller whether we are noting that
only the middle class is shrinking, that it is the middle of the
country that is depopulating, that the political middle is lonelier
and lonelier, that both farms and banks are now only too small to
matter or too big to fail, that almost all journalism is now advocacy
journalism, that middle tier college education is a ticket to debt
and nothing else.
I submit that this trend towards polarization has come to cyber
security.  High end practice is accelerating away from the low end.
The best skills are now astonishingly good while the great mass of
those dependent on cyber security are ever less able to even estimate
what it is that they do not know, much less act on it.  This
polarization is driven by the fundamental strategic asymmetry of
cyber security, namely that while the workfactor for the offender
is the incremental price of finding a new method of attack, the
workfactor for the defender is the cumulative cost of forever
defending against all attack methods yet discovered.  Over time,
the curve for the cost of finding a new attack and the curve for
the cost of defending against all attacks to date must cross.  Once
those curves cross, the offender never has to worry about being out
of the money.  That crossing event occurred some time ago.
I'll come back to this first bullet at the end, but I mention it
first as polarization is becoming structural and of all the trends
the most telling.  You can confirm this by asking the best cyber
security people what they do on the Internet and what they won't
do on the Internet.  You will find it sharply different than what
the public at large does or will do.  The best people know the most,
and they are withdrawing, they are rejecting technologies.  To use
the words and style of the Intelligence Community, they are
Trend  Trends themselves
The idea that under the pressure of constant change about all you
can measure is the slope of the curve has gone from
don't-bother-me-with-math to everybody's-doing-it.  A Google search
for the phrase "information security trends" turns up 13,400 hits
and no two of the top ten are from the same source.  Consultancies
talk about what they are seeing in the back room, product vendors
talk about evolving needs, and reporters talk about what they are
seeing out on the street.
I am one of those folks.  A Wall Street colleague and I run the
Index of Cyber Security.[3]  The ICS is what is called a sentiment-based
index; if you are familiar with the US Consumer Confidence Index,[4]
then you already know what a sentiment-based index is.  Respondents
to the ICS are top drawer cyber security practitioners with direct
operational responsibility who share, each month, how their view
of security in several areas has changed since the month before.
Because there are no absolutes in cyber security, not even widely
agreed upon definitions of the core terms that make up cyber security
practice, a sentiment-based Index is, in fact, the best decision
support that can be done.
The Index asks the respondents monthly whether each of two dozen
different risks has gotten better, gotten worse, gotten a lot better,
gotten a lot worse, or stayed the same since the month before.  Out
of this, the Index of Cyber Security is calculated and released at
6pm on the last calendar day of the month, in further similarity
to the Consumer Confidence Index.  We write an analytic annual
report that I have given to the organizers for your further reading.
As an index of risk, a higher ICS number means higher risk.  That
risk number has risen, and seems likely to continue to rise.  It
is a composite trend line, but what is more interesting is that the
components of the risk are much more varied, i.e., what is the
dominating risk one month may not be the next.  We think that this
captures, in part, the dynamic nature of cyber security and does
so in a way not otherwise being done.  Respondents seem to agree
that the ICS does offer decision support to front-line people such
as themselves.
Trend  then, is that there is increasingly wide acceptance that
absolute measures are not worth seeking and a kind of confirmation
that cyber security is a practice, not a device.
Trend  Physics and its impact on data
As you well know, more and more data is collected and more and more
of that data is in play.  The general, round-numbers dynamic of
this trend are these: Moore's Law continues to give us two orders
of magnitude in compute power per dollar per decade while storage
grows at three orders of magnitude and bandwidth at four.  These
are top-down economic drivers and they relentlessly warp what is
the economically optimum computing model.  The trend is clear; the
future is increasingly dense with stored data but, paradoxically,
despite the massive growth of data volume, that data becomes more
mobile with time.
As is obvious, this bears on cyber security as data is what cyber
security is all about.  In 2007, Jim Gray gave a seminal talk[5]
about the transformation of science, coining the term "fourth
paradigm."  By that he meant that the history of science is that
science began as an endeavor organized around empirical observation.
After that came the age of theory -- theorizing as the paradigm of
what science did.  Then science became computational, again meaning
that the paradigm of what science did was to calculate.  His argument
for a fourth era was that of a paradigm shift from computational
science to data intensive science.  You here at NRO need no primer
on the power of that shift in paradigm, but I am here to tell you
that cyber security is embracing that fourth paradigm and it is
doing it now.
Ecology professor Philip Greear would challenge his graduate students
to catalog all the life in a cubic yard of forest floor.  Computer
science professor Donald Knuth would challenge his graduate students
to catalog everything their computers had done in the last ten
seconds.  It is hard to say which is more difficult, but everywhere
you look, cyber security practitioners are trying to get a handle
on "What is normal?" so that that which is abnormal can be identified
early in the game.  Behavioral approaches leading towards intrusion
detection are exactly the search for anomaly, and they are data
based.  The now-famous attack on RSA Data Security that led to RSA
buying Net Witness is an example of wanting to know everything so
as to recognize something.  I'm on the record at book length [6]
that the central organizing principle behind a competent security
program is to instrument your data sufficiently well that nothing
moves without it being noticed.  Physics has made it possible to
put computers everywhere.  Physics has made it possible to fill
them all with data.
Cyber security is barely keeping up, and not just because of two,
three, or four orders of magnitude in the physics upstream of the
Trend  Need for prediction
We all know that knowledge is power.  We all know that there is a
subtle yet important distinction between information and knowledge.
We all know that a negative declaration like "X did not happen" can
be only proven if you have the enumeration of *everything* that did
happen and can show that X is not in it.  We all know that a stitch
in time saves nine, but only if we know where to put the stitch.
We all know that without security metrics, the outcome is either
overspending or under protecting.
The more technologic the society becomes, the greater the dynamic
range of possible failures.  When you live in a cave, starvation,
predators, disease, and lightning are about the full range of
failures that end life as you know it and you are well familiar
with all of them.  When you live in a technologic society where
everybody and everything is optimized in some way akin to just-in-time
delivery, the dynamic range of failures is incomprehensibly larger
and largely incomprehensible.  The wider the dynamic range of
failure, the more prevention is the watchword.  As technologic
society grows more interdependent within itself, the more it must
rely on prediction based on data collected in broad ways, not
targeted ways.
Some define risk as the probability of a failure times the cost of
that failure.  To be clear, a trend in favor of making predictions
is a trend subsidiary to a trend in the cost of failure.  I've
written at length elsewhere about how an increasing downside cost
of failure requires that we find ways to be resilient, but not
resilient in the sense of rich redundancy, not resilient in the
sense of having quick recovery mechanisms, but resilient in the
sense of having alternate primary means that do not share common
mode risks.  As such, I strongly recommend that manual means be
preserved wherever possible because whatever those manual means
are, they are already fully capitalized and they do not share common
mode risk with digital means.
There is now more information security risk sloshing around the
economy than could actually be accepted were it exposed.  The
tournament now turns to who can minimize their risk the best, which,
in the civilian economy at large, means who can most completely
externalize their downside information security costs.  The weapons
here are perhaps as simple as the wisdom of Delphi, "Know thyself"
and "Nothing to excess" -- know thyself in the sense of quantitative
rigor and a perpetual propensity to design information systems with
failure in mind; nothing to excess in the sense of mimicking the
biologic world's proof by demonstration that species diversity is
the greatest bulwark against loss of an ecosystem.
Trend  Abandonment
If I abandon a car on the street, then eventually someone will be
able to claim title.  If I abandon a bank account, then the State
will eventually seize it.  If I abandon real estate by failing to
remedy a trespass, then in the fullness of time adverse possession
takes over.  If I don't use my trademark, then my rights go over
to those who use what was and could have remained mine.  If I abandon
my spouse and/or children, then everyone is taxed to remedy my
actions.  If I abandon a patent application, then after a date
certain the teaching that it proposes passes over to the rest of
you.  If I abandon my hold on the confidentiality of data such as
by publishing it, then that data passes over to the commonweal not
to return.  If I abandon my storage locker, then it will be lost
to me and may end up on reality TV.  The list goes on.
Apple computers running 10.5 or less get no updates (comprising
about half the installed base).  Any Microsoft computer running XP
gets no updates (comprising about half the installed base).  The
end of security updates follows abandonment.  It is certainly ironic
that freshly pirated copies of Windows get security updates when
older versions bought legitimately do not.
Stating the obvious, if Company X abandons a code base, then that
code base should be open sourced.  Irrespective of security issues,
many is the time that a bit of software I use has gone missing
because its maker went missing.  But with respect to security, some
constellation of {I,we,they,you} are willing and able to provide
security patches or workarounds as time and evil require.
Would the public interest not be served, then, by a conversion to
open source for abandoned code bases?  But wait, you say, isn't
purchased software on a general purpose computer a thing of the
past?  Isn't the future auto-updated smartphone clients transacting
over armored private (carrier) networks to auto-updated cloud
services?  Maybe; maybe not.  If the two major desktop suppliers
update only half of today's desktops, then what percentage will
they update tomorrow?
If you say "Make them try harder!," then the legalistic, regulatory
position is your position, and the ACLU is already trying that
route.  If smartphone auto-update becomes a condition of merchantability
and your smartphone holds the keying material that undeniably says
that its user is you, then how long before a FISA court orders a
special auto-update to *your* phone for evidence gathering?
If you say "But we already know what they're going to do, don't
we?," then the question is what about the abandoned code bases.
Open-sourcing abandoned code bases is the worst option, except for
all the others.  But if seizing an abandoned code base is too big
a stretch for you before breakfast, then start with a Public Key
Infrastructure Certifying Authority that goes bankrupt and ask "Who
gets the keys?"
Trend  Interdependence
The essential character of a free society is this: That which is
not forbidden is permitted.  The essential character of an unfree
society is the inverse, that which is not permitted is forbidden.
The U.S. began as a free society without question; the weight of
regulation, whether open or implicit, can only push it toward being
unfree.  Under the pressure to defend against offenders with a
permanent structural advantage, defenders who opt for forbidding
anything that is not expressly permitted are cultivating a computing
environment that does not embody the freedom with which we are
heretofore familiar.
Put concretely, the central expression of a free society is a free
market, and the cardinal measure of a free market is the breadth
of real choice -- choice that goes beyond color and trim and body
style to choices that optimize discordant, antithetical goal states.
The level of choice on the Internet is draining down.  You may revel
in the hundreds of thousands of supposedly new voices that have
found a way to chatter in full view.  You may note that new "apps"
for Android plus iPhone are appearing at over a thousand per day.
You may rightly remind us all that technology is democratizing in
the sense that powers once reserved for the few are now irretrievably
in the hands of the many.  What stands against that, and why I say
that it stands against that, is increasing interdependence.
We humans can design systems more complex than we can then operate.
The financial sector's "flash crashes" are an example of that;
perhaps the fifty interlocked insurance exchanges for Obamacare
will soon be another.  Above some threshold of system complexity,
it is no longer possible to test, it is only possible to react to
emergent behavior.  The lowliest Internet user is entirely in the
game of interdependence -- one web page can easily touch scores of
different domains.  While writing this, the top level page from
cnn.com had 400 out-references to 85 unique domains each of which
is likely to be similarly constructed and all of which move data
one way or another.  If you leave those pages up and they have an
auto-refresh, then moving to a new network signals to every one of
those ad networks that you have so moved.
The wellspring of risk is dependence, especially dependence on
shared expectations of shared system state, i.e., interdependence
on the ground.  If you would accept that you are most at risk from
the things you most depend upon, then damping dependence is the
cheapest, most straightforward, lowest latency way to damp risk,
just as the fastest and most reliable way to put more money on a
business's bottom line is through cost control.
Trend  Automation
Shoshana Zuboff of the Harvard Business School notably described
three laws of the digital age,
. Everything that can be automated will be automated.
. Everything that can be informated will be informated.
. Every digital application that can be used for surveillance and
.    control will be used for surveillance and control.
It is irrelevant, immaterial and incompetent to argue otherwise.
For security technology, Zuboff's Laws are almost the goal state,
that is to say that the attempt to automate information assurance
is in full swing everywhere, the ability to extract information
from the observable is in full swing everywhere, and every digital
application is being instrumented.
Before In-Q-Tel, I worked for a data protection company.  Our product
was, and I believe still is, the most thorough on the market.  By
"thorough" I mean the dictionary definition, "careful about doing
something in an accurate and exact way."  To this end, installing
our product instrumented every system call on the target machine.
Data did not and could not move in any sense of the word "move"
without detection.  Every data operation was caught and monitored.
It was total surveillance data protection.  What made this product
stick out was that very thoroughness, but here is the point: Unless
you fully instrument your data handling, it is not possible for you
to say what did not happen.  With total surveillance, and total
surveillance alone, it is possible to treat the absence of evidence
as the evidence of absence.  Only when you know everything that
*did* happen with your data can you say what did *not* happen with
your data.
But this trend of automating is now leaving the purely defensive
position behind.  In a press release two weeks ago today,[7] DARPA
signaled exactly that, and I quote
   [T]he Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency intends to hold
   the Cyber Grand Challenge -- the first-ever tournament for fully
   automatic network defense systems.  DARPA envisions teams creating
   automated systems that would compete against each other to
   evaluate software, test for vulnerabilities, generate security
   patches and apply them to protected computers on a network.  The
   growth trends ... in cyber attacks and malware point to a future
   where automation must be developed...
The automation trend is irreversible, but it begs a question that
I fear no one will answer in a way that doesn't merely reflect their
corporate or institutional interest, namely are people in the loop
a failsafe or a liability?[8]
Trend  Dual use
I've become convinced that all security technology is dual use.
While I am not sure whether dual use is a trend or a realization
of an unchanging fact of nature, the obviousness of dual use seems
greatest in the latest technologies, so I am calling it a trend in
the sense that the straightforward accessibility of dual use
characteristics of new technology is a growing trend.
There are a lot of examples, but in the physical world any weapon
usable for defense can be repurposed for offense.  Every security
researcher looking for exploitable flaws is deep in the dual use
debate because once discovered, those flaws can be patched or they
can be sold.  The cyber security products that promise total
surveillance over the enterprise are, to my mind, an offensive
strategy used for defensive purposes.
There was a time when flaws were predominantly found by adventurers
and braggarts.  Ten plus years of good work by the operating system
vendors elbowed the flaw finders out of the operating system and,
as a result, our principal opponents changed over from adventurers
and braggarts to being professionals.  Finding vulnerabilities and
exploiting them is now hard enough that it has moved out of the
realm of being a hobby and into the realm of being a job.  This
changed several things, notably that braggarts share their findings
because they are paid in bragging rights.  By contrast, professionals
do not share and are paid in something more substantial than fame.
The side effect has been a continued rise in the percentage of all
vulnerabilities that are previously unknown.  The trend, in other
words, is that by crushing hobbyists we've raised the market price
of working exploits to where now our opponents pay for research and
development out of revenue.
Simulating what the opponent can do thus remains the central task
of defensive research.  Much of that research is in crafting proofs
of concept that such and such a flaw can be taken advantage of.
Corman's neologism of "HD Moore's Law" says that the trend in the
power of the casual attacker grows as does the trend of the power
in Metasploit.[9] It is hard to think of a better description of
dual use.
Trend  The blurring of end-to-end
To my mind, the most important technical decision ever made was
that the security of the Internet was to be "end-to-end."[10]
"End-to-end" is a generic technical term yet simple to explain: the
Internet was built on the premise that two entities could connect
themselves to each other and decide what they wanted to do.  The
network was a delivery vehicle, but the form, content, and security
of the connection between the two ends was to be their own choice.
End-to-end is a model where the terminal entities are smart and the
network is dumb.  This is completely (completely) different than a
smart network with dumb terminal entities at the end of the wire.
No other design decision of the Internet comes close to the importance
of it's being an end-to-end design.  With end-to-end, security is
the choice of the terminal end-points, not something built into the
fabric of the Internet itself.  That is American values personified.
It is the idea that accountability, not permission seeking, is the
way a government curbs the misuse of freedoms, and, as accountability
scales but permission seeking does not, accountability wins.
End-to-end security is the digital manifestation of the right of
association and, in any case, is what enabled the Internet to become
relevant in the first place.  End-to-end does precisely what Peter
Drucker told us to do: "Don't solve problems, create opportunities."
The provision of content from anywhere to anywhere, which is the
very purpose of an internetwork, is a challenge to sovereignty.
America's Founders wanted no sovereign at all, and they devised a
government that made the center all but powerless and the periphery
fully able to thumb its nose at whatever it felt like.  Much ink
has been spilled on the frontier ethic versus the wishful policies
favored by the comfortable urbanity of the welfare state, but the
Internet's protocols have everything in common with the former and
nothing in common with the latter.
The free man requires the choice of with what degree of vigor to
defend himself.  That is a universal; America's Founders laid that
down in the Second Amendment, just as did George Orwell in the
English democratic socialist weekly "Tribune" when he said, "That
rifle on the wall of the laborer's cottage or working class flat
is the symbol of democracy.  It is our job to see that it stays
there."  Were George Washington or George Orwell still among us,
they would know that smart end-points and dumb networks are what
freedom requires, that smart networks protecting dumb end-points
breed compliant dependency.
But the trend is otherwise, and not just because of the fatuous
fashionability of entitlement, but rather because of a blurring of
what the term "end" means.  So very many people have adopted automatic
synchronization of multiple devices they own that one has to ask
whether their tablet is an end or their collection of mutually
synchronized devices is an end.  So many Internet-dependent functions
are spread silently across numerous entities and applications that
what is the end may well be more dynamic than can be described.  If
an end implies unitary control on the part of an owner, then set
theory says that mutually synchronized devices are a unitary end.
That blurring of "end" makes end-to-end provisioning problematic
as a set of devices cannot be assumed to be equally on and equally
participating in any given transaction.  Quoting Clark & Blumenthal[11]
   There is a risk that the range of new requirements now emerging
   could have the consequence of compromising the Internet's original
   design principles.  Were this to happen, the Internet might lose
   some of its key features, in particular its ability to support
   new and unanticipated applications.  We link this possible outcome
   to a number of trends: the rise of new stakeholders in the
   Internet,...  new government interests, the changing motivations
   of the growing user base, and the tension between the demand for
   trustworthy overall operation and the inability to trust the
   behavior of individual users.
This is nowhere so evident as in security, that is to say in the
application of the end-to-end principle to cyber security.  What
does end-to-end secure transport mean when travelocity.com is showing
you a page dynamically constructed from a dozen other entities?
Trend  Complexity in the supply chain
Even without resorting to classified information, it is now clear
that supply chain attacks have occurred.  Whether reading journalistic
accounts or Richard Clarke's novel _Breakpoint_, the finding is
that the supply chain creates opportunities for badness.  None of
the things I've yet read, however, blames the supply chain risk on
its complexity, per se, but that is the trend that matters.
Security is non-composable -- we can get insecure results even when
our systems are assembled from secure components.  The more components,
the less likely a secure result.  This applies to supply chains
that are growing ever more complex under the pressure of just-in-time,
spot market sourcing of, say, memory chips and so forth and so on.
Because the attacker has only to find one component of that chain
to be vulnerable while the defender has to assure that all components
are invulnerable, rising supply chain complexity guarantees increased
opportunity for effective attack.  It cannot do otherwise, and the
trend is clear.
Trend  Monoculture(s)
Beginning with Forrest in 1997,[12] regular attention has been paid
to the questions of monoculture in the network environment.  There
is no point belaboring the fundamental question, but let me state
it for the record: cascade failure is so very much easier to detonate
in a monoculture -- so very much easier when the attacker has only
to write one bit of malware, not ten million.  The idea is obvious;
believing in it is easy; acting on its implications is, evidently,
rather hard.
I am entirely sympathetic to the actual reason we continue to deploy
computing monocultures -- making everything almost entirely alike
is, and remains, our only hope for being able to centrally manage
it in a consistent manner.  Put differently, when you deploy a
computing monoculture you are making a fundamental risk management
decision: That the downside risk of a black swan event is more
tolerable than the downside risk of perpetual inconsistency.  This
is a hard question, as all risk management is about changing the
future, not explaining the past.  Which would you rather have, the
unlikely event of a severe impact, or the day-to-day burden of
perpetual inconsistency?
When we opt for monocultures we had better opt for tight central
control.  This supposes that we are willing to face the risks that
come with tight central control, of course, including the maximum
risk of all auto-update schemes, namely the hostile takeover of the
auto-update mechanism itself.  Computer desktops are not the point;
embedded systems are.  The trendline in the number of critical
monocultures seems to be rising and many of these are embedded
systems both without a remote management interface and long lived.
That combination -- long lived and not reachable -- is the trend
that must be reversed.  Whether to insist that embedded devices
self destruct at some age or that remote management of them be a
condition of deployment is the question.  In either case, the
Internet of Things and the appearance of microcontrollers in seemingly
every computing device should raise hackles on every neck.[13]
Trend  Attack surface growth versus skill growth
Everyone here knows the terminology "attack surface" and knows that
one of the defender's highest goals is to minimize the attack surface
wherever possible.  Every coder adhering to a security-cognizant
software lifecycle program does this.  Every company or research
group engaged in static analysis of binaries does this.  Every
agency enforcing a need-to-know regime for data access does this.
Every individual who reserves one low-limit credit card for their
Internet purchases does this.  I might otherwise say that any person
who encrypts their e-mail to their closest counterparties does this,
but because consistent e-mail encryption is so rare, encrypting
one's e-mail marks it for collection and indefinite retention by
those entities in a position to do so, regardless of what country
you live in.
In cyber security practice, the trend is that we practitioners as
a class are getting better and better.  We have better tools, we
have better understood practices, and we have more colleagues.
That's the plus side.  But I'm interested in the ratio of skill to
challenge, and as far as I can estimate, we are expanding the
society-wide attack surface faster than we are expanding our
collection of tools, practices, and colleagues.  If you are growing
more food, that's great.  If your population is growing faster than
your improvements in food production can keep up, that's bad.
In the days of radio, there was Sarnoff's Law, namely that the value
of a broadcast network was proportional to N, the number of listeners.
Then came packetized network communications and Metcalfe's Law,
that the value of a network was proportional to N squared, the
number of possible two-way conversations.  We are now in the era
of Reed's Law where the value of a network is proportional to the
number of groups that can form in it, that is to say 2 to the power
N.  Reed's Law is the new reality because it fits the age of social
networks.  In each of these three laws as publicly stated, the sign
bit is positive, but in parallel with the claim that everything is
dual use, the sign bit can also be negative because interconnections
are a contributor to the net attack surface.  If an Internet of
Things is indeed imminent, then the upward bend in the curve of the
global attack surface will grow steeper regardless of what level
of risk there is for any one thing so long as that level of risk
is always non-zero.
Trend  Specialization
Everyone my age working in cyber security was trained for something
else, and because of that switch between one field and another
brings along the hybrid vigor of seeing the cyber security world
through a different lens.  Statisticians, civil engineers, and
lawyers alike can contribute.  But the increasing quality of prepatory
education, the increasing breadth of affairs for which cyber security
is needful, and the increasing demand for skill of the highest sort
means the humans in the game are specializing.
While some people like to say "Specialization is for insects," tell
me that the security field itself is not specializing.  We have
people who are expert in forensics on specific operating system
localizations, expert in setting up intrusion response, expert in
analyzing large sets of firewall rules using non-trivial set theory,
expert in designing egress filters for universities that have no
ingress filters, expert in steganographically watermarking binaries,
and so forth.  Generalists are becoming rare, and they are being
replaced by specialists.  This is biologic speciation in action,
and the narrowing of ecologic niches.  In rough numbers, there are
somewhere close to 5,000 various technical certifications you can
get in the computer field, and the number of them is growing thus
proving the conjecture of specialization and speciation is not just
for insects and it will not stop.

NSA tracking cellphone locations worldwide, Snowden documents show
By Barton Gellman and Ashkan Soltani, Wednesday, December 4, 12:18 PM
The National Security Agency is gathering nearly 5 billion records a
day on the whereabouts of cellphones around the world, according to
top-secret documents and interviews with U.S. intelligence officials,
enabling the agency to track the movements of individuals — and map
their relationships — in ways that would have been previously
The records feed a vast database that stores information about the
locations of at least hundreds of millions of devices, according to
the officials and the documents, which were provided by former NSA
contractorEdward Snowden. New projects created to analyze that data
have provided the intelligence community with what amounts to a mass
surveillance tool.
(Video: How the NSA uses cellphone tracking to find and ‘develop’ targets)
The NSA does not target Americans’ location data by design, but the
agency acquires a substantial amount of information on the whereabouts
of domestic cellphones “incidentally,” a legal term that connotes a
foreseeable but not deliberate result.
One senior collection manager, speaking on condition of anonymity but
with permission from the NSA, said “we are getting vast volumes” of
location data from around the world by tapping into the cables that
connect mobile networks globally and that serve U.S. cellphones as
well as foreign ones. Additionally, data is often collected from the
tens of millions of Americans who travel abroad with their cellphones
every year.
In scale, scope and potential impact on privacy, the efforts to
collect and analyze location data may be unsurpassed among the NSA
surveillance programsthat have been disclosed since June. Analysts can
find cellphones anywhere in the world, retrace their movements and
expose hidden relationships among individuals using them.
(Graphic: How the NSA is tracking people right now)
U.S. officials said the programs that collect and analyze location
data are lawful and intended strictly to develop intelligence about
foreign targets.
Robert Litt, general counsel for the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence, which oversees the NSA, said “there is no
element of the intelligence community that under any authority is
intentionally collecting bulk cellphone location information about
cellphones in the United States.”
The NSA has no reason to suspect that the movements of the
overwhelming majority of cellphone users would be relevant to national
security. Rather, it collects locations in bulk because its most
powerful analytic tools — known collectively as CO-TRAVELER — allow it
to look for unknown associates of known intelligence targets by
tracking people whose movements intersect.
Still, location data, especially when aggregated over time, is widely
regarded among privacy advocates as uniquely sensitive. Sophisticated
mathematical techniques enable NSA analysts to map cellphone owners’
relationships by correlating their patterns of movement over time with
thousands or millions of other phone users who cross their paths.
Cellphones broadcast their locations even when they are not being used
to place a call or send a text.
(Video: Reporter Ashkan Soltani explains NSA collection of cellphone data)
CO-TRAVELER and related tools require the methodical collection and
storage of location data on what amounts to a planetary scale. The
government is tracking people from afar into confidential business
meetings or personal visits to medical facilities, hotel rooms,
private homes and other traditionally protected spaces.
“One of the key components of location data, and why it’s so
sensitive, is that the laws of physics don’t let you keep it private,”
said Chris Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil
Liberties Union. People who value their privacy can encrypt their
e-mails and disguise their online identities, but “the only way to
hide your location is to disconnect from our modern communication
system and live in a cave.”
The NSA cannot know in advance which tiny fraction of 1 percent of the
records it may need, so it collects and keeps as many as it can — 27
terabytes, by one account, or more than double the text content of the
Library of Congress’s print collection.
The location programs have brought in such volumes of information,
according to a May 2012 internal NSA briefing, that they are
“outpacing our ability to ingest, process and store” data. In the
ensuing year and a half, the NSA has been transitioning to a
processing system that provided it with greater capacity.
The possibility that the intelligence community has been collecting
location data, particularly of Americans, has long concerned privacy
advocates and some lawmakers. Three Democratic senators — Ron Wyden
(Ore.), Mark Udall (Colo.) and Barbara Mikulski (Md.) — have
introduced an amendment to the 2014 defense spending bill that would
require U.S. intelligence agencies to say whether they have ever
collected or made plans to collect location data for “a large number
of United States persons with no known connection to suspicious
NSA Director Keith Alexander disclosed in Senate testimony in October
that the NSA had run a pilot project in 2010 and 2011 to collect
“samples” of U.S. cellphone location data. The data collected were
never available for intelligence analysis purposes, and the project
was discontinued because it had no “operational value,” he said.
Alexander allowed that a broader collection of such data “may be
something that is a future requirement for the country, but it is not
right now.”
The number of Americans whose locations are tracked as part of the
NSA’s collection of data overseas is impossible to determine from the
Snowden documents alone, and senior intelligence officials declined to
offer an estimate.
“It’s awkward for us to try to provide any specific numbers,” one
intelligence official said in a telephone interview. An NSA
spokeswoman who took part in the call cut in to say the agency has no
way to calculate such a figure.
An intelligence lawyer, speaking with his agency’s permission, said
location data are obtained by methods “tuned to be looking outside the
United States,” a formulation he repeated three times. When U.S.
cellphone data are collected, he said, the data are not covered by the
Fourth Amendment, which protects Americans against unreasonable
searches and seizures.
According to top-secret briefing slides, the NSA pulls in location
data around the world from 10 major “sigads,” or signals intelligence
activity designators.
A sigad known as STORMBREW, for example, relies on two unnamed
corporate partners described only as ARTIFICE and WOLFPOINT. According
to an NSA site inventory, the companies administer the NSA’s “physical
systems,” or interception equipment, and “NSA asks nicely for
STORMBREW collects data from 27 telephone links known as OPC/DPC
pairs, which refer to originating and destination points and which
typically transfer traffic from one provider’s internal network to
another’s. That data include cell tower identifiers, which can be used
to locate a phone’s location.
The agency’s access to carriers’ networks appears to be vast.
“Many shared databases, such as those used for roaming, are available
in their complete form to any carrier who requires access to any part
of it,” said Matt Blaze, an associate professor of computer and
information science at the University of Pennsylvania. “This ‘flat’
trust model means that a surprisingly large number of entities have
access to data about customers that they never actually do business
with, and an intelligence agency — hostile or friendly — can get ‘one
stop shopping’ to an expansive range of subscriber data just by
compromising a few carriers.”
Some documents in the Snowden archive suggest that acquisition of U.S.
location data is routine enough to be cited as an example in training
materials. In an October 2012 white paper on analytic techniques, for
example, the NSA’s counterterrorism analysis unit cites two U.S.-based
carriers to illustrate the challenge of correlating the travels of
phone users on different mobile networks. Asked about that, a U.S.
intelligence official said the example was poorly chosen and did not
represent the program’s foreign focus.
The NSA’s capabilities to track location are staggering, based on the
Snowden documents, and indicate that the agency is able to render most
efforts at communications security effectively futile.
Like encryption and anonymity tools online, which are used by
dissidents, journalists and terrorists alike, security-minded behavior
— using disposable cellphones and switching them on only long enough
to make brief calls — marks a user for special scrutiny. CO-TRAVELER
takes note, for example, when a new telephone connects to a cell tower
soon after another nearby device is used for the last time.
Side-by-side security efforts — when nearby devices power off and on
together over time — “assist in determining whether co-travelers are
associated … through behaviorally relevant relationships,” according
to the 24-page white paper, which was developed by the NSA in
partnership with the National Geospatial Agency, the Australian
Signals Directorate and private contractors.
A central feature of each of these tools is that they do not rely on
knowing a particular target in advance, or even suspecting one. They
operate on the full universe of data in the NSA’s FASCIA repository,
which stores trillions of metadata records, of which a large but
unknown fraction include locations.
The most basic analytic tools map the date, time, and location of
cellphones to look for patterns or significant moments of overlap.
Other tools compute speed and trajectory for large numbers of mobile
devices, overlaying the electronic data on transportation maps to
compute the likely travel time and determine which devices might have
To solve the problem of undetectable surveillance against CIA officers
stationed overseas, one contractor designed an analytic model that
would carefully record the case officer’s path and look for other
mobile devices in steady proximity.
“Results have not been validated by operational analysts,” the report said.

NSA morale down after Edward Snowden revelations, former U.S. officials say
By Ellen Nakashima, Published: December 7
Morale has taken a hit at the National Security Agency in the wake of
controversy over the agency’s surveillance activities, according to
former officials who say they are dismayed that President Obama has
not visited the agency to show his support.
A White House spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden, noted that top White House
officials have been to the agency to “express the president’s support
and appreciation for all that NSA does to keep us safe.”
It is not clear whether or when Obama might travel the 23 miles up the
Baltimore-Washington Parkway to visit Fort Meade, the NSA’s
headquarters in Maryland, but agency employees are privately voicing
frustration at what they perceive as White House ambivalence amid the
pounding the agency has taken from critics.
An NSA spokeswoman had no comment.
Obama in June defended the NSA’s surveillance as lawful and said he
welcomed the public debate prompted by revelations from former
contractor Edward Snowden beginning that month.
Though Obama has asserted, for instance, that the NSA’s collection of
virtually all Americans’ phone records is lawful and has saved lives,
the administration has not endorsed legislation that would codify it.
And his recent statements suggest he thinks some of the NSA’s
activities should be constrained.
A senior administration official who was not authorized to speak on
the record said that the White House would normally not endorse
legislation so early in the process but that “it’s been clear . . .
that we prefer legislation” that preserves the phone records program
“while making some changes . . . to potentially strengthen oversight
and transparency.”
Said Hayden: “The president has the highest respect for and pride in
the men and women of the intelligence community who work tirelessly to
protect our nation. He’s expressed that directly to NSA’s leadership
and has praised their work in public. As he said: ‘The men and women
of our intelligence community work every single day to keep us safe
because they love this country and believe in our values. They’re
patriots.’ ”
She noted that in recent weeks, Lisa Monaco, assistant to the
president for homeland security and counterterrorism, and Denis
McDonough, the White House chief of staff, visited Fort Meade “to
express the president’s support and appreciation for all that NSA does
to keep us safe.”’
Supporters of the NSA say staffers are not feeling the love.
“The agency, from top to bottom, leadership to rank and file, feels
that it is had no support from the White House even though it’s been
carrying out publicly approved intelligence missions,” said Joel
Brenner, NSA inspector general from 2002 to 2006. “They feel they’ve
been hung out to dry, and they’re right.”
A former U.S. official — who like several other former officials
interviewed for this story requested anonymity because he still has
dealings with the agency — said: “The president has multiple
constituencies — I get it. But he must agree that the signals
intelligence NSA is providing is one of the most important sources of
intelligence today.
“So if that’s the case, why isn’t the president taking care of one of
the most important elements of the national security apparatus?”
The White House, observers say, is caught between competing desires to
preserve what it has said are valuable national security programs and
to shield the president from criticism from allies abroad and
civil-liberties advocates at home.
Some observers said it is not surprising that Obama would not travel
to Fort Meade before internal and external reviews of surveillance
activities have been completed. The reviews are expected to be done
The NSA’s director, Gen. Keith Alexander, who is retiring in the
spring after 81 / 2 years, has been the most vocal defender of the
agency’s 35,000 employees. In speeches he has noted that more than
6,000 of them went to Iraq and Afghanistan to support the military. He
has spoken of how 22 cryptologists were killed. “They’re the heroes —
not the media leaker,” he said in a September speech, in a reference
to Snowden.
NSA counterterrorism analysts have worked “every weekend for eight
years since I’ve been here. . . . Twenty-four hours a day, seven days
a week, they’re there to defend us,” he said then.
On Thursday, Obama said on MSNBC that he would be proposing “some
self-restraint on the NSA” and “some reforms that can give people more
In an interview with NBC last month, he said: “In some ways, the
technology and the budgets and the capacity [at NSA] have outstripped
the constraints. And we’ve got to rebuild those in the same way that
we’re having to do on a whole series of capacities . . . [such as]
drone operations.”
Civil-liberties advocates generally agree with that sentiment, but
they would go further and say that the NSA’s bulk collection of
domestic phone records is unlawful and ought to be ended.
Former officials note how President George W. Bush paid a visit to the
NSA in January 2006, in the wake of revelations by the New York Times
that the agency engaged in a counterterrorism program of warrantless
surveillance on U.S. soil beginning after the Sept. 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks. “Bush came out and spoke to the workforce, and the
effect on morale was tremendous,” Brenner said. “There’s been nothing
like that from this White House.”
A second former official said NSA workers are polishing up their
résumés and asking that they be cleared — removing any material linked
to classified programs — so they can be sent out to potential
employers. He noted that one employee who processes the résumés said,
“I’ve never seen so many résumés that people want to have cleared in
my life.”
Morale is “bad overall,” a third former official said. “The news — the
Snowden disclosures — it questions the integrity of the NSA
workforce,” he said. “It’s become very public and very personal.
Literally, neighbors are asking people, ‘Why are you spying on
Grandma?’ And we aren’t. People are feeling bad, beaten down.”

sort of; there are some interesting attacks using a force-pushed
silent PRL update (see DC19/DC20 cell attacks threads) which would be
observable by tower ID oddities, not to mention decremented or zero
PRL version.  however, you'd have to be paying attention (who checks
their PRL regularly? :).
if you simply check if a tower is in
 for example, you're open to
attacks spoofing a legitimate but remote (out of range) tower.
using direction finding techniques to cross reference the transmitter
location against the expected GPS coordinates in a tower database
relative to your position would also detect these tower impersonators,
but requires more hardware than a mobile baseband...
the expensive, limited distribution kit will be hard to distinguish
without a high performance software defined radio.  if you're able to
detect an identically spoofed tower using OsmocomBB with high
confidence i'd love to know how you did it!
truth.  also, an inversion of observed data link capacity (suddenly
seeing receive bandwidth drop in half or more while transmit rate
doubles) is no bueno.

FCC plainly states systems  "wholly dependent on open source elements”
would have a “high burden” to demonstrate their security during the

I think there may be weaknesses in Intel's hardware RNG.  I took a
good look at Intel's hardware random number generator source. There's
a paper analyzing it here:
The basic idea is that back-to-back inverters, when powered on, flip
one way or the other randomly, sort of like DRAM memory when our
computer's power on.  By powering on a single pair of back-to-back
inverters over and over, they can generate a random bit per cycle, at
about 3 Giga-bits/second, which is amazing!  Here's my concerns about
the the paper:
- I saw no mathematical analysis of how much noise exists in the
system and how strongly it will influence the result each cycle. There
were generalities about how the noise could cause the output to be
random, but no numbers at all.
- There is an assumption that the capacitors are charged/discharged by
10% of the standard deviation of the noise.  I saw no justification
for this.  It seems they simply assumed best case.
- The paper is about as objective as a mother talking about her
children.  For example: "Overall, the Ivy Bridge RNG is a robust
design with a large margin of safety that ensures good random data is
generated even if the ES is not operating as well as predicted." Based
on what?
- I am not convinced they have the right model for the entropy source.
 They add noise to the bias on the capacitors, and compare that to 0
to determine the next output bit in their model.  I think the main
source of noise may be the randomness in number of electrons
added/subtracted each cycle, and that the back-to-back inverters in
the absence of other noise may be acting almost as an ideal
comparator.  However, if this were the case, even if there were 10%
noise in the number of electrons, there would be considerable
correlation between bits.
I also have questions about the design itself.  My main concern is
that noise on the VDD rail could easily determine the output.  For
example, if the transistors are mismatched, which of course they will
be, and the bias is set exactly right on the caps so there's a 50-50
chance of a 0 or 1, and suddenly VDD drops 10% due to a rising edge of
the the main system clock, then the inverter with higher gate
thresholds will become weak faster than the other one, thus
determining which one wins.  Since this circuit runs asynchronously
from the main system clock, I could easily see the 3MHz system clock
phase relative to the entropy generator clock determining most of the
results from the entropy source, while looking fairly random. Any
weakness in the raw random data stream is hidden from us by the AES
encryption done as a post-process.
I simulated back-to-back inverters in my .35u low power CMOS process
in SPICE to see if I could figure out how to make a practical circuit
using Intel's topology.  If it works, it would be fantastic.  I think
I can get rid of most of the supply noise issues.  I had a similar
problem in my "Infinite Noise Multiplier", so I switched to powering
the circuit with nothing but large W and L constant current sources,
and using the range from 0V to Vref, rather than 0V to VDD, because
Vref is stable relative to AVSS. However, I wasn't able to get enough
noise to make Intel's ciruit work, though that may be due to
limitations in the SPICE simulator.
Has anyone else had success using Intel's RNG topology?

I have to take back my criticism of Intel's RNG.  I got my sims
working for a version of their architecture in .35u CMOS, and it's
simply better than my "Infinite Noise Multiplier".  It's probably the
best true random noise generator ever.  I still don't like how their
schematic is seems highly sensitive to supply noise, but we don't know
what the actual circuit looks like.  Intel hasn't told us.
So, I'm going to modify it a bit to use the resistors available on my
chip and reduce the caps, fix the supply sensitivity, and I think I
can run 16 of these things in parallel at 100-200MHz on the tiny .35u
CMOS chip I'm designing.  I'll spit out the raw waveforms from the
inverters, buffered once, through 16 "analog" pins, so there wont be
any fear (hopefully) that I'm cooking the data on-chip, before you can
see it, and I'll open-source the schematics.  If there's a circuit
that can consume all 1.6Gbit/sec of this raw data, have fun with it!
On the digital side, I'll XOR bits together to get the bandwidth down
to something reasonable, which I can send over USB, and provide a
simple Linux driver.
This thing will definitely put out RF, but since I'm making the raw
data available at the pins, should I care?  By the way, this is just a
for-fun project at work.  I get to do a free chip design :-)

the partnership with NGA to deploy them gives a hint: this is putting
USRPs up close and personal to target for exploitation.

given the obtained bits mentioned (WLLids, DSL accounts, Cookies,
GooglePREFIDs) gathered and then handed off to TAO for further QUANTUM
INSERT fucking of target systems it is likely they are doing GSM/cell
MitM to observe identifiers, along with WiFi attacks, and other egress
rather than deploying baseband exploits or deep active attacks
directly against the devices or other networks they're communicating
thus CNE in this case is cell MitM/WiFi pwn with a USRP rogue tower to
get identifiers for TAO.  and TAO is where they get dirty with "remote
exploitation" of the device itself and other targets on networks it
we've seen how they have a smorgasbord of weaponized exploits to cover
the gamut of target hardware and technical acumen in the QUANTUM

see also this section on the OPEC hacks:
Here’s how the NSA and GCHQ go after an organization like OPEC step by
step, based on an analysis of the NSA and GCHQ documents exposed by
Step 1: Identify. Using the NSA-built packet capture and inspection
system called TURMOIL, the agencies filter through Internet traffic at
a network choke point looking for specific "fingerprints" in traffic
that identify users with the organization being targeted. Data from
TURMOIL gets pulled into a number of traffic analysis tools, such as
XKeyscore and TRAFFICTHIEF, which do different sorts of packet
XKeyscore is the NSA's distributed search engine, catching a large
chunk of international Internet traffic for analysis. It helps find
things deep in the clutter of the Internet that analysts might miss by
allowing them to use search terms to find things in both live and
cached Internet traffic.
TRAFFICTHIEF, on the other hand, is much more focused. It filters for
very "strong" indicators, like known sets of IP addresses, addresses
within e-mail traffic, or user names in logins to social networks or
other services. It provides less depth of analysis than XKeyscore, but
it can handle much larger loads of data because it is more selective
about what it processes.
Together, the tools can be used to identify the systems used by an
individual or organization, including ranges of addresses that they
may use from work or home.
Step 2: Target. Using the profiles built using the surveillance tools,
the agencies can then identify potential points of attack. XKeyscore,
for example, can be used to search for patterns that identify known
security vulnerabilities within a range of addresses. Web visit
histories, e-mail traffic, and other data are analyzed looking for the
most likely (and least detectable) approach to gain access, and a
specific attack plan is crafted, including the identification of where
to launch the attack from.
At the NSA, this sort of thing is the work of Tailored Access
Operations. In the case of OPEC, the targeting process apparently went
on for several years as the NSA sought openings for an attack.
Step 3: Attack. Depending on who the target is, the NSA and GCHQ have
a variety of options. The least costly is to use access provided by
one of the intelligence agencies' telecommunications "partners" who
own network equipment at an exchange or other choke point that the
target's Internet traffic passes through. The agency running the
attack can use that access to introduce changes to Internet routing
tables that detour the targeted individual's traffic. But in some
cases, the NSA and GCHQ may have to perform "unilateral" taps on
network backbones to gain that level of access—targeting a piece of
network hardware to take over or splicing directly into the target's
own connection to the Internet.
It's not clear which attack the NSA used to gain access to OPEC's
systems, though the GCHQ used a Quantum attack two years later to gain
its own very special access to the cartel's network. In the case of
the Belgacom hack, the GCHQ used a Quantum insert attack—routing the
Web requests for LinkedIn and Slashdot from the engineer being
targeted to a server posing as those sites. The NSA has used the same
approach to intercept traffic to sites such as Google.
The man-in-the-middle server can present content from the actual sites
the target intended to visit, but it can also add content to the
traffic, using what's called packet injection—modifying the contents
of the data as it passes through—and intercept the user's credentials.
And by using a forged certificate, the NSA can intercept encrypted
traffic intended for the destination site.
Once the user has connected to the fake server, the intelligence
agencies can use the connection to launch attacks against the target's
Web browser to install monitoring software or other malware, using
similar techniques to those used by hackers. They can also use
credentials exposed via the man-in-the-middle attack to gain access to
other accounts owned by the target and to troll through connections in
those services that might be potential targets.
Step 4: Exploit. Once the target's computer has been successfully
attacked, the effort begins to look much like that of the Chinese
cyber warriors' attack of the New York Times or what cyber criminals
typically do when they score access to high-value targets. The
agencies' hackers work to stealthily expand their level of access,
using customized remote administration tools to grab user privileges
and gain access to other network resources—mail servers, file servers,
and other network systems. They then start to "exfiltrate" data from
these systems and deliver them to analysts.

"used in Virtual Private Network" == PPTP,IPsec,OpenVPN,etc.
"Web encryption devices" == in my interpretation, this is any targeted
hardware with the vulnerable chip.  it could be a tablet, a desktop,
and rack mount server...  any of these platforms could speak VPN or
Web crypto.  TAO/SCS do like to get into the switches though ;)
mostly "cloud infrastructure", "software defined data center", and the like:
back in the day, Sun got tired of the (relatively) slow performance
and latency of crypto offloading via bus and simply threw it into the
core.  you were still offloading crypto, but within the CPU.
also note that endpoint compromises sufficient to decrypt VPN or
secure web traffic is already present in TAO/CNE's tasking.  this
effort [CCP_00009] may focus on VPN concentrator / secure web proxy
deployments specifically to handle the RDRAND lookup per their private
starting counter.
previous back doors have also used entropy leakage sufficient to bring
a brute force attack into reasonable effort, while still denying third
parties a class break of the entropy / keys used.  this type of key
space search is not done on the ground with portable CNE but instead
back at SCS...
on a related tangent, the lack of additional disclosures is quite
frustrating.  this entire conversation would be resolved in a glance
if $the_snowden_gatekeepers were acting in the public interest.  :/

Ok, given those requirements. Who fits the bill?
High end platform:
Intel targets what it believes is a significant growth opportunity to
bring the Intel Architecture into a rapidly evolving networking space.
Intel added to its portfolio with the introduction of the Highland
Forest platform, which combines the vendor’s Xeon E5-2600 v2 CPU with
its new Coleto Creek chipset. Price said Highland Forest – which can
pack up to 20 2.4GHz “Ivy Bridge” CPU cores – will offer two to six
times the performance of the previous Crystal Forest platform, which
was launched in October 2012.
Highland Forest, with Intel’s Data Plane Development Kit, can deliver
up to 255 million packets per second (p/s) – more than the 140 million
p/s from Crystal Forest – as well as security capabilities of 110
Gigabits per second of IPsec and 200 Gb/s SSL security for encrypted
IPsec (VPN) and SSL (Web crypto) and lots of it!  sounds interesting.
tell me more!
other market points of note:
- "Intel currently has over 15 SDN/NFV qualification trials underway
with carriers in all major regions.  Schooler emphasized that Intel
has no intention to sell directly to service providers and is fully
committed to launching an Intel Network Builders Ecosystem of industry
players supporting the Intel Architecture."
- "6WIND Announces Availability of Support for Intel® Xeon® Processor

funny they seem to distance themselves from "Highland Forest" and "Ivy

hey Wind River, how are you using RDRAND?
now what about Intel themselves, are they also pushing the chip?
Intel officials are making aggressive moves to expand the reach of its
silicon beyond servers and into other parts of the data centre.
Schooler said the company has been making products for networking gear
for about a decade, and has made significant strides in recent years.
It’s also made several acquisitions – such as of Sensory Networks,
Ethernet chip maker Fulcrum Microsystems and networking software maker
Aepona, whose technology enables telecoms and cloud service providers
to offer more services on their networks.
Intel is looking to take advantage of the growth opportunity
networking represents, Schooler said. The market Intel is targeting is
about $16 billion (£9.7bn), and the chip maker currently has about 5
percent of it. Along with its x86 architecture, Intel also is
developing accelerator chips for such jobs as packet inspection and
whew.  that's a lot of context and circumstance.  let's look back over
your goals for 2013:

i will admit that i am continually impressed by NSA/SCS achievements.

special collection of many of them (20+) handling tier-1 core traffic
encryption, which is an excellent point to aggregate a vulnerability
in keying ciphers. (ignore public key for now, since we can just focus

this does bring up an interesting point:
while it may be more efficient to use the same "key" for the DRBG
output across all processor lines, it would be more secure to use a
different key per line.  this implies that each iteration of Sandy
Bridge -> Ivy Bridge -> Haswell needs to be "enabled" by CCP, with

for Sandy Bridge, this would have shown in 2010? and unless in network

sadly we'll have to wait a while to confirm this conjecture for
Haswell.  and we'll have to wait forever for more leaks apparently, as

Certivox Asked That We Share Their Side of the Story on the PrivateSky Takedown.
The real story on the PrivateSky takedown.
Posted by Brian Spector on Thu, Dec 12, 2013
With the story about our PrivateSky takedown now public, I want to
take the opportunity to clarify a few points in various articles that
have appeared since yesterday covering the story.
Some headlines strongly infer our friends at GCHQ "forced" us to take
PrivateSky down. That's not the case.
Secondly, a very important point wasn't printed. GCHQ couldn't, by
law, request a blanket back door on the system. There are a very rigid
set of controls that mean only specific individuals can come under
surveillance. The legal request for such surveillance has a due
process that must be stridently followed. At no time did I or anyone
at CertiVox talk about CertiVox in relation to any RIPA warrant, only
the generic process by which these warrants are served.
By saying "our friends at GCHQ", there is no facetiousness intended.
The team at CertiVox have the upmost respect for the folks we
interacted with at GCHQ. They took the due process I outlined in the
previous point very seriously. We found that as an organisation, and
every individual involved there, were as worried about a breach of
public trust as much as we are.
Finally, I believe very strongly the following should be a larger part
of the public discourse of these subjects. What everyone needs to
understand is that every developed democracy in the world, even where
privacy rights are enshrined to the maximum efficacy by statute, has
laws on the books that mandate that Internet Service Providers have
facilities to work with law enforcement for the purposes of legal
intercept, to enforce public safety and security.
Being L.I. capable is a very important set features and functions that
must be in place for any credible, commercial service on the Internet.
In endeavouring to make PrivateSky as secure as possible, we
overlooked this critical requirement when we built PrivateSky.
When CertiVox positioned PrivateSky as the easiest to use and most
secure encrypted messaging service, we really had two significant
points of differentiation. First, even though we held the root
encryption keys to the system, it was architected in such as way that
it would have been all but impossible for our internal staff to snoop
on our customer's communications, or for the service to leak any of
our customer¹s data. Secondly, our possession of the root keys, and
our use of identity based encryption, made the system incredibly easy
to use. For the user, there were no private or public keys to manage,
every workflow was handled for the user in an easy to grasp pure HTML5
interface, no hardware or software required, just an HTML5 browser.
We boxed ourselves into a feature set and market position that when
called upon to comply with legal statues, we simply had no alternative
but to shut the service down. We built it, but we couldn't host it.
Why? Because as you can probably surmise, there is an inherent
impedance mismatch between being able to host a commercial
communications service that gives the upmost in privacy to its users,
against any breach, whilst at the same time being able to operate
safely within the confines of the law as it is on the books in most
countries on the planet.
In summary, it's the abuse of the communications interception in the
Snowden revelations that has everyone up in arms, as so it should. But
that¹s not what happened with PrivateSky.
What is our next move?

ah FSB; you crack me up!
'''A senior officer of Russian counter-intelligence said: "Although

I am pretty sure that kidnaping the former NSA employee will be
dramatically challenging." He also thanked "former NSA employees and

Edward Snowden can be kidnapped from Russia?
10.12.2013 14:57
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of NSA's total control systems can
be kidnapped from Russia. This is a priority for the British MI-6 and
the British Embassy, former NSA agent Wayne Madsen said, referring to
his colleagues.
Of course, nothing is known whether the CIA received the task, and
whether the U.S. Embassy is going to be involved in the activities to
try to kidnap Snowden. However, the British Embassy has already
tracked calls and letters of Snowden's "inner circle" and begun to
"dig up" their contacts in Moscow.
According to The Guardian, Snowden has the information, the disclosure
of which could become a nightmare for the U.S., even though the
fugitive NSA specialist decided not to disclose some of his data. In
addition, The Guardianadmitted that the media have so far published
"only 1%" of available information about NSA's total control over
billions of people in different countries.
Nevertheless, even this one percent has already made the UK
authorities introduce outright censorship against those who reveal
secrets of "global surveillance."
In particular, Wayne Madsen said that his girlfriend, who previously
worked for the National Security Agency as an expert on the Russian
language, tried to contact Snowden's acquaintances. Afterwards, she
was invited to come to the British Embassy and undergo special
training. She was also asked to report of FSB's interest in her
persons and communications.
The press quoted a former NSA expert, who said that the job to find
Snowden was of the highest priority for the embassy. Moreover, it was
said that the future operation to kidnap him involved number one MI-6
officer at the embassy, who worked under diplomatic cover as the
director for regional security.
The Center for the Study of Globalization has previously reported that
should the operation be successful, Snowden would be delivered to the
UK or the U.S. For the time being, the flywheel of total wiretapping
that Snowden launched was working against him to the utmost. "MI-6
intelligence agencies have begun to analyze the information they were
able to obtain through intelligence," the statement from the center
A senior officer of Russian counter-intelligence, whom Politonline.ru
confidentially managed to talk to, said: "Although the Federal
Security Bureau does not do anything about human rights activist
Snowden, the service has been active in counterintelligence. I am
pretty sure that kidnaping the former NSA employee will be
dramatically challenging." He also thanked "former NSA employees and
journalists for publishing such information, but added that
operational, technical and other measures to counter intelligence and
other illegal activities of foreign secret services on the territory
of Russia were  constantly maintained.
It only remains to add that the CIA has recently created a special
section in Russian on its official website, in which the department
offered Russian citizens (!) to join American intelligence. To choose
from, for example, the CIA offers engineering and technical
directions, a linguistic job, a secret agent with the knowledge of
Russian language and experts in business and analysts. The CIA
reportedly hopes to obtain classified information from newcomers in
the above areas to establish a new database of agents.

Full Disclosure as per the FreeBSD announcement[0] and others[1][2] direct use of
RDRAND as sole entropy source is not recommended.
from Westmere onward you could use AES-NI to make crypto fast in
OpenSSL.  a common theme is to initialize OpenSSL via
ENGINE_load_builtin_engines() which lets OpenSSL take advantage of
this acceleration.
with Sandy Bridge you also got RDRAND. now load_builtin_engines
results in the application using RDRAND directly for all entropy, in
addition to accelerating AES.
if you are using an application linked with openssl-1.0.1-beta1
through openssl-1.0.1e you should do one of the following:
a.) rebuild your OpenSSL with OPENSSL_NO_RDRAND defined.
b.) call RAND_set_rand_engine(NULL) after ENGINE_load_builtin_engines().
c.) git pull latest openssl with commit: "Don't use rdrand engine as
default unless explicitly requested." - Dr. Stephen Henson
the OPENSSL_NO_RDRAND option is recommended; an inadvertent call to
load engines elsewhere could re-enable this bad rng behavior.

it's legit.
on a more serious note, regarding the assumption:
 "if everything is backdoored already, essentially key escrow exists"
NSA has stated that many of their BULLRUN techniques are incredibly
fragile.  a number of them now burned in leaks, many yet to get
stuffed. if they "did it risky"[0], perhaps feeling emboldened by the
seeming success of Dual_EC_DRBG and friends, a common key / reduction
hidden behind AES-128 rounds could be discovered, independently
confirmed, and properly attributed.
so not only can the backdoors be broken up, replacements which are
resistant to compromise will take their stead.  "everything" becomes
"much" becomes "very little" until ideally such invasive tactics are
reserved for HUMINT tasked "good ol'e detective work" with legal
bonafides judged according to public laws and applicable to all
persons on earth, not just tribal deference pointed inward.
the jury is out; there are encouraging signs... but first, back to

your understanding is flawed.  let me clarify:
the NSA does not currently break Tor on demand at the protocol level.
all indications are this is currently true.
the NSA and others have great success around Tor by opportunistically
watching users fuck up (see other usability thread), by pwning their
horribly insecure systems (0days as far as the eye can see..), and by
actively manipulating user paths to the Tor network or destination
"forget your global passive adversary threats, active denial and
manipulation of service attacks are _really_ scary!"

expensive a solution to the same ends provided by much cheaper means.

Towards Efficient Traffic-analysis Resistant Anonymity Networks
Stevens LeBlond, David Choffnes, Wenxuan Zhou, Peter Druschel, Hitesh
Ballani, and Paul Francis
August 2013
Existing IP anonymity systems tend to sacrifice one of low latency,
high bandwidth, or resistance to traffic-analysis. High-latency
mix-nets like Mixminion batch messages to resist traffic-analysis at
the expense of low latency. Onion routing schemes like Tor deliver low
latency and high bandwidth, but are not designed to withstand traffic
analysis. Designs based on DC-nets or broadcast channels resist
traffic analysis and provide low latency, but are limited to low
bandwidth communication.
In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation
of Aqua, a high bandwidth anonymity system that resists traffic
analysis. We focus on providing strong anonymity for BitTorrent, and
evaluate the performance of Aqua using traces from hundreds of
thousands of actual Bit-Torrent users. We show that Aqua achieves
latency low enough for efficient bulk TCP flows, bandwidth sufficient
to carry BitTorrent traffic with reasonable efficiency, and resistance
to traffic analysis within anonymity sets of hundreds of clients. We
conclude that Aqua represents an interesting new point in the space of
anonymity network designs.

We were somewhere in San Francisco on the edge of the 56th IETF when
the drugs began to take hold.  I remember saying something like "I
feel a bit
lightheaded; maybe you should take notes...."  And suddenly there was a
terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge
OIDs, all swooping and screeching and diving around the RFC, which was about a
hundred pages long.  And a voice was screaming: "Holy Jesus!  Where are these
goddamn business cases?"
Then it was quiet again.  My attorney had taken his shirt off and was pouring

Wyden estimates that he gets about fifteen minutes a year to ask
questions of top intelligence officials at open hearings. With the
help of his intelligence staffer, John Dickas, a thirty-five-year-old
from Beaverton, Oregon, whom Wyden calls “the hero of the
intelligence-reform movement,” Wyden often spends weeks preparing his
questions. He and Dickas look for opportunities to interrogate
officials on the gaps between what they say in public and what they
say in classified briefings. At a technology conference in Nevada the
previous summer, General Keith Alexander, the director of the N.S.A.,
had said that “the story that we have millions or hundreds of millions
of dossiers on people is absolutely false.” Wyden told me recently,
“It sure didn’t sound like the world I heard about in private.” For
months, he tried to get a clarification from the N.S.A. about exactly
what Alexander had meant. Now he had the opportunity to ask Clapper in
public. As a courtesy, he had sent him the question the day before.
Wyden leaned forward and read Alexander’s comment. Then he asked,
“What I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to
the question ‘Does the N.S.A. collect any type of data at all on
millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?’ ”
Clapper slouched in his chair. He touched the fingertips of his right
hand to his forehead and made a fist with his left hand.
“No, sir,” he said. He gave a quick shake of his head and looked down
at the table.
“It does not?” Wyden asked, with exaggerated surprise.
“Not wittingly,” Clapper replied. He started scratching his forehead
and looked away from Wyden. “There are cases where they could
inadvertently perhaps collect, but not wittingly.”
Wyden told me, “The answer was obviously misleading, false.”

interesting work on using poor quality sound (like from a phone) for
chosen cipher text attacks with key recovery for GPG.
also note that they use frequencies >10kHz.  as discussed in the high
frequency audio covert channel, this range is fairly contention free
and easily accessible to microphones in consumer electronics of
various types.
Here, we describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis key extraction attack,
applicable to GnuPG's current implementation of RSA. The attack can
extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of
various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the
computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We
experimentally demonstrate that such attacks can be carried out, using
either a plain mobile phone placed next to the computer, or a more
sensitive microphone placed 4 meters away.
Beyond acoustics, we demonstrate that a similar low-bandwidth attack
can be performed by measuring the electric potential of a computer
chassis. A suitably-equipped attacker need merely touch the target
computer with his bare hand, or get the required leakage information
from the ground wires remote end of VGA, USB or Ethernet

Inside TAO
Documents Reveal Top NSA Hacking Unit
By SPIEGEL Staff
The NSA's TAO hacking unit is considered to be the intelligence
agency's top secret weapon. It maintains its own covert network,
infiltrates computers around the world and even intercepts shipping
deliveries to plant back doors in electronics ordered by those it is
In January 2010, numerous homeowners in San Antonio, Texas, stood
baffled in front of their closed garage doors. They wanted to drive to
work or head off to do their grocery shopping, but their garage door
openers had gone dead, leaving them stranded. No matter how many times
they pressed the buttons, the doors didn't budge. The problem
primarily affected residents in the western part of the city, around
Military Drive and the interstate highway known as Loop 410.
In the United States, a country of cars and commuters, the mysterious
garage door problem quickly became an issue for local politicians.
Ultimately, the municipal government solved the riddle. Fault for the
error lay with the United States' foreign intelligence service, the
National Security Agency, which has offices in San Antonio. Officials
at the agency were forced to admit that one of the NSA's radio
antennas was broadcasting at the same frequency as the garage door
openers. Embarrassed officials at the intelligence agency promised to
resolve the issue as quickly as possible, and soon the doors began
opening again.
It was thanks to the garage door opener episode that Texans learned
just how far the NSA's work had encroached upon their daily lives. For
quite some time now, the intelligence agency has maintained a branch
with around 2,000 employees at Lackland Air Force Base, also in San
Antonio. In 2005, the agency took over a former Sony computer chip
plant in the western part of the city. A brisk pace of construction
commenced inside this enormous compound. The acquisition of the former
chip factory at Sony Place was part of a massive expansion the agency
began after the events of Sept. 11, 2001.
On-Call Digital Plumbers
One of the two main buildings at the former plant has since housed a
sophisticated NSA unit, one that has benefited the most from this
expansion and has grown the fastest in recent years -- the Office of
Tailored Access Operations, or TAO. This is the NSA's top operative
unit -- something like a squad of plumbers that can be called in when
normal access to a target is blocked.
According to internal NSA documents viewed by SPIEGEL, these on-call
digital plumbers are involved in many sensitive operations conducted
by American intelligence agencies. TAO's area of operations ranges
from counterterrorism to cyber attacks to traditional espionage. The
documents reveal just how diversified the tools at TAO's disposal have
become -- and also how it exploits the technical weaknesses of the IT
industry, from Microsoft to Cisco and Huawei, to carry out its
discreet and efficient attacks.
The unit is "akin to the wunderkind of the US intelligence community,"
says Matthew Aid, a historian who specializes in the history of the
NSA. "Getting the ungettable" is the NSA's own description of its
duties. "It is not about the quantity produced but the quality of
intelligence that is important," one former TAO chief wrote,
describing her work in a document. The paper seen by SPIEGEL quotes
the former unit head stating that TAO has contributed "some of the
most significant intelligence our country has ever seen." The unit, it
goes on, has "access to our very hardest targets."
A Unit Born of the Internet
Defining the future of her unit at the time, she wrote that TAO "needs
to continue to grow and must lay the foundation for integrated
Computer Network Operations," and that it must "support Computer
Network Attacks as an integrated part of military operations." To
succeed in this, she wrote, TAO would have to acquire "pervasive,
persistent access on the global network." An internal description of
TAO's responsibilities makes clear that aggressive attacks are an
explicit part of the unit's tasks. In other words, the NSA's hackers
have been given a government mandate for their work. During the middle
part of the last decade, the special unit succeeded in gaining access
to 258 targets in 89 countries -- nearly everywhere in the world. In
2010, it conducted 279 operations worldwide.
Indeed, TAO specialists have directly accessed the protected networks
of democratically elected leaders of countries. They infiltrated
networks of European telecommunications companies and gained access to
and read mails sent over Blackberry's BES email servers, which until
then were believed to be securely encrypted. Achieving this last goal
required a "sustained TAO operation," one document states.
This TAO unit is born of the Internet -- created in 1997, a time when
not even 2 percent of the world's population had Internet access and
no one had yet thought of Facebook, YouTube or Twitter. From the time
the first TAO employees moved into offices at NSA headquarters in Fort
Meade, Maryland, the unit was housed in a separate wing, set apart
from the rest of the agency. Their task was clear from the beginning

that this is not as sophisticated as the more recent TAO toys with

the keyboard tampering:

while that was not bad, aside from leaking tamper event, the FDE was
so sad/funny. a screw amuck, replacement drive significantly different
(when compared to identical lot mate purchased with original that got
yanked for offline attack)
in a round about manner this was all instigated in part by wifi
research done at the time which put various powerful entities into a
tiff.  here's what the pacNW sample looked like back in early 2003:
"Cleartext Nodes: 8755 (62.59%)
  , WEP Nodes: 5232 (37.40%)"

one last fun learning by example: consider that you thwart direct
physical access black bag type attempts, and are not running a
vulnerable router/CPE, and present a sufficiently compelling target,
you may encounter a clever "just outside the property line" isolation
and active attack on DOCSIS uplink. (a broadcast medium is hard to
mess with in a covert manner, unless you're able to isolate target
from the local broadcast loop itself.)

@_subject: Replacing corporate search engines with anonymous/decentralized 
decentralized search (not just not-corporate search) persists as one
of the great
practical challenges in peer to peer networking.
i have more to say later, but one effort from back in early 2000 is alpine:
   inside the 2004 snapshot there is also docs and implementation of
feedbackfs which is used to gather implicit feedback on recommendation
alpine is explicitly highly connected, flatter than not network
topology to improve robustness in the face of failure and active
attacks, and to avoid limitations inherent in many connection oriented
operating system facilities/sockets.
i am not quite an impartial party ;)
 but other approaches which are not a feasible replacement include:
 - the old skewl (mostly)flooding broadcasts like gnutella
 - fragile, hard to defend constructs like DHTs as keyword indexes
 - aggressive caching with local search (110% useful, but not sufficient alone)
 - distributed (but better somehow) search engines on darknets, etc.
these are more about search privacy or deep search more than
decentralized search.
the longer discussion is how to make decentralized search useful.
"Google style" search has a terrific performance advantage over
decentralized designs by brute force.
however, take advantage of massive endpoint / peer processing and
resources combined with implicit observational metrics for reputation
and recommendation, inside a well integrated framework for resource
discovery in usable software, and you have something more robust and
more effective than "Google style" could ever provide.
this is quite the trick, however!  despite an inter-operable component
model interface, and dynamic runtime module support to extend
discovery and wire protocol extensions, and other intentional efforts
at encouraging adoption and integration, alpine failed to bootstrap.
(i did many things wrong, but those things i did at least make
conscious effort to do right.  did i mention this is a hard problem?

maintenance upgrades[0] at minimum and significant improvement a

 Full Disclosure this, in the traditional sense, is what John calls a "COMSEC cover-up":
 meaning that the continual, most significant, and most likely to be
abused and widely are commercial services and collaborations and
  where the product is your private information of any sort, that you
usually unwittingly but sometimes capriciously yield to un trustworthy
third parties with little constraint on secondary distribution for
money to further removed stranger parties...
note that fully decentralized, end-to-end secured, with properly
managed keying and sessions capable technologies are resistant to
these third-party weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
crypto and comms and computing technology should not be abandoned en
whole like the russians for their manual type writers, but the minimum
required operational safety of any information processing system needs
huge innovation to get from current systems to something effective and
usable...  hey look, it's more of those fun problems to solve again ;)

 cpunks regarding the inability for NSA employees to report ethical violations
in a manner that did not assure retribution:
this is actually a somewhat difficult anonymity / privacy question in
the context of highly compartmented information and operations, where
knowledge of a subset of specific details is sufficient to imply
strong suspicion and scrutiny to a very small number of individuals...
... assuming you don't circumvent the apparently mediocre constraints
to this information in the information systems that contain it. ;)
while academically interesting, in all practical terms we should
render this question moot and provide absolute communication
origin[0], destination[1], and content[2] privacy to all network users
in all locations under all circumstances guaranteed by constitutional
law, prosecutorial discretion, and practical realities (read:
implementations resistant to Tailored Access Operations like efforts
(NSA TAO / CNE related programs)
this latter guarantee will require a bit more design, coding and deployment,
 fun problems to solve![3]
1.  "peer communication endpoint privacy" - this is a hard problem.
the existing implementations are not usable and insufficiently large
in anonymity set (too few users): zero knowledge high latency mail
like messaging mixes, even if the twitter mixes are pretty cool.
a proper solution would be datagram based, NAT busting, low latency
(read: sufficiently real-time for video and voice), the majority
protocol across the Internet and local intranets and ad-hoc mesh nets
and other networks,
in an implementation that resists all known general purpose (wide
scale) and specialized (highly targeted and/or weaponized bleeding
edge and/or privileged positioned) attacks.
2. strong encryption like: alligator wrapped forward secrecy intended
streams, and equivalent techniques, solve this problem.
  clearly there is much work to do in the implementation and protocol
side of crypto integrity.  very, very much work...
3. "NSA TAO / CNE related programs" resistance is a very tall bar.
they rolled this out at DEF CON, of course. the soon departing .gov
Alexander rolled into town with some world class shit, no doubt...  is
it really going to be 33 years before we can talk about it?  for
better or for worse we won't have Snowden to disclose this

Snowden Says He Took No Secret Files to Russia
By JAMES RISEN
WASHINGTON - Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency
contractor, said in an extensive interview this month that he did not
take any secret N.S.A. documents with him to Russia when he fled there
in June, assuring that Russian intelligence officials could not get
access to them.
Mr. Snowden said he gave all of the classified documents he had
obtained to journalists he met in Hong Kong, before flying to Moscow,
and did not keep any copies for himself. He did not take the files to
Russia because it wouldn't serve the public interest," he said.
"What would be the unique value of personally carrying another copy of
the materials onward?" he added.
He also asserted that he was able to protect the documents from
China's spies because he was familiar with that nation's intelligence
abilities, saying that as an N.S.A. contractor he had targeted Chinese
operations and had taught a course on Chinese
"There's a zero percent chance the Russians or Chinese have received
any documents," he said.
American intelligence officials have expressed grave concern that the
files might have fallen into the hands of foreign intelligence
services, but Mr. Snowden said he believed that the N.S.A. knew he had
not cooperated with the Russians or the Chinese. He said he was
publicly revealing that he no longer had any agency documents to
explain why he was confident that Russia had not gained access to
them. He had been reluctant to disclose that information previously,
he said, for fear of exposing the journalists to greater scrutiny.
In a wide-ranging interview over several days in the last week, Mr.
Snowden offered detailed responses to accusations that have been
leveled against him by American officials and other critics, provided
new insights into why he became disillusioned with the N.S.A. and
decided to disclose the documents, and talked about the international
debate over surveillance that resulted from the revelations. The
interview took place through encrypted online communications.
Mr. Snowden, 30, has been praised by privacy advocates and assailed by
government officials as a traitor who has caused irreparable harm, and
he is facing charges under the Espionage Act for leaking the N.S.A.
documents to the news media. In the interview, he said he believed he
was a whistle-blower who was acting in the nation's best interests by
revealing information about the N.S.A.s surveillance dragnet and huge
collections of communications data, including that of Americans.
He argued that he had helped American national security by prompting a
badly needed public debate about the scope of the intelligence effort.
The secret continuance of these programs represents a far greater
danger than their disclosure," he said. He added that he had been more
concerned that Americans had not been told about the N.S.A.s reach
than he was about any specific surveillance operation.
So long as there's broad support amongst a people, it can be argued
there's a level of legitimacy even to the most invasive and morally
wrong program, as it was an informed and willing decision," he said.
However, programs that are implemented in secret, out of public
oversight, lack that legitimacy, and that's a problem. It also
represents a dangerous normalization of governing in the dark, where
decisions with enormous public impact occur without any public input.
Mr. Snowden said he had never considered defecting while in Hong Kong,
nor in Russia, where he has been permitted to stay for one year. He
said he felt confident that he had kept the documents secure from
Chinese spies, and that the N.S.A. knew he had done so. His last
target while working as an agency contractor was China, he said,
adding that he had had access to every target, every active
operation mounted by the N.S.A. against the Chinese. Full lists of
them, he said.
If that was compromised, he went on, N.S.A. would have set the
table on fire from slamming it so many times in denouncing the damage
it had caused. Yet N.S.A. has not offered a single example of damage
from the leaks. They havent said boo about it except we think,
maybe, have to assume from anonymous and former officials. Not
China is going dark. Not the Chinese military has shut us out.
An N.S.A. spokeswoman did not respond Thursday to a request for
comment on Mr. Snowden's assertions.
Mr. Snowden said his decision to leak N.S.A. documents developed
gradually, dating back at least to his time working as a technician in
the Geneva station of the C.I.A. His experiences there, Mr. Snowden
said, fed his doubts about the intelligence community, while also
convincing him that working through the chain of command would only
lead to retribution.
He disputed an account in The New York Times last week reporting that
a derogatory comment placed in his personnel evaluation while he was
in Geneva was a result of suspicions that he was trying to break in to
classified files to which he was not authorized to have access. (The
C.I.A. later took issue with the description of why he had been
reprimanded.) Mr. Snowden said the comment was placed in his file by a
senior manager seeking to punish him for trying to warn the C.I.A.
about a computer vulnerability.
Mr. Snowden said that in 2008 and 2009, he was working in Geneva as a
telecommunications information systems officer, handling everything
from information technology and computer networks to maintenance of
the heating and air-conditioning systems. He began pushing for a
promotion, but got into what he termed a petty e-mail spat in which
he questioned a senior manager's judgment.
Several months later, Mr. Snowden said, he was writing his annual
self-evaluation when he discovered flaws in the software of the
C.I.A.s personnel Web applications that would make them vulnerable to
hacking. He warned his supervisor, he said, but his boss advised him
to drop the matter and not rock the boat. After a technical team also
brushed him off, he said, his boss finally agreed to allow him to test
the system to prove that it was flawed.
He did so by adding some code and text in a nonmalicious manner=94 to
his evaluation document that showed that the vulnerability existed, he
said. His immediate supervisor signed off on it and sent it through
the system, but a more senior manager the man Mr. Snowden had
challenged earlier was furious and filed a critical comment in Mr.
Snowden's personnel file, he said.
He said he had considered filing a complaint with the C.I.A.=92s
inspector general about what he considered to be a reprisal, adding
that he could not recall whether he had done so or a supervisor had
talked him out of it. A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment on Mr.
Snowden's account of the episode or whether he had filed a complaint.
But the incident, Mr. Snowden said, convinced him that trying to work
through the system would only lead to punishment. He said he knew of
others who suffered reprisals for what they had exposed, including
Thomas A. Drake, who was prosecuted for disclosing N.S.A. contracting
abuses to The Baltimore Sun. (He met with Mr. Snowden in Moscow last
week to present an award to him for his actions.) And he knew other
N.S.A. employees who had gotten into trouble for embarrassing a senior
official in an e-mail chain that included a line, referring to the
Chinese Army, that said, Is this the P.L.A. or the N.S.A.?
Mr. Snowden added that inside the spy agency theres a lot of dissent
 palpable with some, even. But he said that people were kept in line
through fear and a false image of patriotism, which he described as
obedience to authority.
He said he believed that if he tried to question the N.S.A.s
surveillance operations as an insider, his efforts would have been
buried forever, and he would have been discredited and ruined.=94 He
said that the system does not work, adding that you have to report
wrongdoing to those most responsible for it.
Mr. Snowden said he finally decided to act when he discovered a copy
of a classified 2009 inspector generals report on the N.S.A.s
warrantless wiretapping program during the Bush administration. He
said he found the document through a dirty word search, which he
described as an effort by a systems administrator to check a computer
system for things that should not be there in order to delete them and
sanitize the system.
"It was too highly classified to be where it was," he said of the
report. He opened the document to make certain that it did not belong
there, and after he saw what it revealed, curiosity prevailed, he
After reading about the program, which skirted the existing
surveillance laws, he concluded that it had been illegal, he said. =93If
the highest officials in government can break the law without fearing
punishment or even any repercussions at all, he said, secret powers
become tremendously dangerous.
He would not say exactly when he read the report, or discuss the
timing of his subsequent actions to collect N.S.A. documents in order
to leak them. But he said that reading the report helped crystallize
his decision. You cant read something like that and not realize what
it means for all of these systems we have," he said.
Mr. Snowden said that the impact of his decision to disclose
information about the N.S.A. had been bigger than he had anticipated.
He added that he did not control what the journalists who had the
documents wrote about. He said that he handed over the documents to
them because he wanted his own bias divorced from the decision-making
of publication, and that technical solutions were in place to ensure
the work of the journalists couldn't be interfered with."
Mr. Snowden declined to provide details about his living conditions in
Moscow, except to say that he was not under Russian government control
and was free to move around.

in addition to legal protections, educational support, and competitive programs,
also provide:
- direct and unrestricted backbone access to various individuals or
groups who demonstrate competence in either the educational or
competitive realms, in order for them to mount additional attack
strategies against any reach-able target.  this access must consist of
both passive taps of backbone traffic as well as injection taps for
raw packet transmission at core rates. this should be available on the
Internet backbone at internet exchanges, private fiber through public
right of way, and core networks of operators of licensed wireless
a side benefit of implementing these reforms would be the de-facto
de-funding of offensive network operations by third parties or
governments. the cost to keep ahead of such a widespread, popular, and
distributed effort would be enormous, and provide continually
decreasing returns.
...  getting there is much more complicated of course.   *grin*

of course; the complete details will be slow to arrive, not least
because detailed description requires a demonstration in a
reproduction test setup, rather than reporting of actual traffic. :/
that said, useful aspects i'll certainly provide on whim or request.
the defining characteristics of the two types of attacks:
DC19 with DRT:
- "high power on-site", less descriminant attacks. target by and
limited to location.
- MitM for system, application, and protocol level attacks. Evilgrade,
MasterKey vulns, etc.  mostly known and a few 0day escalated attacks.
- favorite attack: "Google Voice Search" always-on eavesdropper
payload; Speex voice from all audible participants.
DC20 with Alexander's toys:
- "in the towers", highly targeted to specific devices, active over
wide metro area.
- baseband exploit vector for device key retrieval, memory and storage
forensics, exfiltration.
- PDoS attacks (bricked secondary devices used as fall back once
identified by call graph; ~20 hours)
- favorite attack: baseband pwn in airplane mode, with ex-filtration
over custom channel.
DC21: no appearance (observed).  speculation ongoing...
reversing attacker capabilities, toolkits, TTPs, humanpower/hours, a
much longer tangent.  but this assertion is based on correlation of
the observed power, capacity, and protocols in specific bands
implemented by the attacker with the capabilities of the DRT system.
multiple locations, terabytes of captured spectrum, patience and
as for who was operating it - unknown beyond the usual suspects, which
is a small set due to the restricted distribution of both the hardware
platform and the exploit kit atop it :)
i'll send more details once available.  the details and distribution
to be part of a separate FOIPA effort for US citizen security

thought provoking read, as always. thanks Dan :)
this is worth posting whole, particularly this observation:
... polarization has come to cyber
security.  High end practice is accelerating away from the low end.
The best skills are now astonishingly good while the great mass of
those dependent on cyber security are ever less able to even estimate
what it is that they do not know, much less act on it.  This
polarization is driven by the fundamental strategic asymmetry of
cyber security, namely that while the workfactor for the offender
is the incremental price of finding a new method of attack, the
workfactor for the defender is the cumulative cost of forever
defending against all attack methods yet discovered.  Over time,
the curve for the cost of finding a new attack and the curve for
the cost of defending against all attacks to date must cross.  Once
those curves cross, the offender never has to worry about being out
of the money.  That crossing event occurred some time ago.
i do have one comment, per:
Everyone my age working in cyber security was trained for something
else, and because of that switch between one field and another
brings along the hybrid vigor of seeing the cyber security world
through a different lens.
instead of having a "cyber security" profession, all aspects of
"information security", "software security", or "cyber security" as a
specialization should not exist.  competence and experience with these
subjects should be considered part of routine software and systems
development practice. (right now this is mostly impractical, however,
it need not always be so...)

.Trends in Cyber Security
.Dan Geer, 6 November 13, NRO
Thank you for the invitation to speak with you today, which, let
me be clear, is me speaking as myself and not for anybody or anything
else.  As you know, I work the cyber security trade, that is to say
that my occupation is cyber security.  Note that I said "occupation"
rather than "profession."  On 18 September, the U.S. National Academy
of Sciences, on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security,
concluded that cyber security should be seen as an occupation and
not a profession because the rate of change is too great to consider
professionalization.[1]  You may well agree that that rate of change
is paramount and thus why cyber security is the most intellectually
demanding occupation on the planet.  In writing this essay, I will
keep my comments to trends rather than point estimates, just as you
asked in your invitation, but let me emphasize the wisdom of your
request by noting that the faster the rate of change, the more it
is trends that matter and not the value of any given variable at
any given time.  With luck, each of these trends will not be something
that you would argue with as a trend.  Argument, if any, will be
in their interpretation.
Note also that these trends do not constitute a set of mutually
exclusive, collectively exhaustive characterizations of the space
in which we live and work.  Some of them are correlated with others.
Some of them are newly emergent, some not.  Some of them are
reversible to a degree; some not reversible at all.  I am not, today
anyway, looking for causality.
Trend  Polarization
Much has been written about the increasing polarization of American
life.[2]  The middle is getting smaller whether we are noting that
only the middle class is shrinking, that it is the middle of the
country that is depopulating, that the political middle is lonelier
and lonelier, that both farms and banks are now only too small to
matter or too big to fail, that almost all journalism is now advocacy
journalism, that middle tier college education is a ticket to debt
and nothing else.
I submit that this trend towards polarization has come to cyber
security.  High end practice is accelerating away from the low end.
The best skills are now astonishingly good while the great mass of
those dependent on cyber security are ever less able to even estimate
what it is that they do not know, much less act on it.  This
polarization is driven by the fundamental strategic asymmetry of
cyber security, namely that while the workfactor for the offender
is the incremental price of finding a new method of attack, the
workfactor for the defender is the cumulative cost of forever
defending against all attack methods yet discovered.  Over time,
the curve for the cost of finding a new attack and the curve for
the cost of defending against all attacks to date must cross.  Once
those curves cross, the offender never has to worry about being out
of the money.  That crossing event occurred some time ago.
I'll come back to this first bullet at the end, but I mention it
first as polarization is becoming structural and of all the trends
the most telling.  You can confirm this by asking the best cyber
security people what they do on the Internet and what they won't
do on the Internet.  You will find it sharply different than what
the public at large does or will do.  The best people know the most,
and they are withdrawing, they are rejecting technologies.  To use
the words and style of the Intelligence Community, they are
Trend  Trends themselves
The idea that under the pressure of constant change about all you
can measure is the slope of the curve has gone from
don't-bother-me-with-math to everybody's-doing-it.  A Google search
for the phrase "information security trends" turns up 13,400 hits
and no two of the top ten are from the same source.  Consultancies
talk about what they are seeing in the back room, product vendors
talk about evolving needs, and reporters talk about what they are
seeing out on the street.
I am one of those folks.  A Wall Street colleague and I run the
Index of Cyber Security.[3]  The ICS is what is called a sentiment-based
index; if you are familiar with the US Consumer Confidence Index,[4]
then you already know what a sentiment-based index is.  Respondents
to the ICS are top drawer cyber security practitioners with direct
operational responsibility who share, each month, how their view
of security in several areas has changed since the month before.
Because there are no absolutes in cyber security, not even widely
agreed upon definitions of the core terms that make up cyber security
practice, a sentiment-based Index is, in fact, the best decision
support that can be done.
The Index asks the respondents monthly whether each of two dozen
different risks has gotten better, gotten worse, gotten a lot better,
gotten a lot worse, or stayed the same since the month before.  Out
of this, the Index of Cyber Security is calculated and released at
6pm on the last calendar day of the month, in further similarity
to the Consumer Confidence Index.  We write an analytic annual
report that I have given to the organizers for your further reading.
As an index of risk, a higher ICS number means higher risk.  That
risk number has risen, and seems likely to continue to rise.  It
is a composite trend line, but what is more interesting is that the
components of the risk are much more varied, i.e., what is the
dominating risk one month may not be the next.  We think that this
captures, in part, the dynamic nature of cyber security and does
so in a way not otherwise being done.  Respondents seem to agree
that the ICS does offer decision support to front-line people such
as themselves.
Trend  then, is that there is increasingly wide acceptance that
absolute measures are not worth seeking and a kind of confirmation
that cyber security is a practice, not a device.
Trend  Physics and its impact on data
As you well know, more and more data is collected and more and more
of that data is in play.  The general, round-numbers dynamic of
this trend are these: Moore's Law continues to give us two orders
of magnitude in compute power per dollar per decade while storage
grows at three orders of magnitude and bandwidth at four.  These
are top-down economic drivers and they relentlessly warp what is
the economically optimum computing model.  The trend is clear; the
future is increasingly dense with stored data but, paradoxically,
despite the massive growth of data volume, that data becomes more
mobile with time.
As is obvious, this bears on cyber security as data is what cyber
security is all about.  In 2007, Jim Gray gave a seminal talk[5]
about the transformation of science, coining the term "fourth
paradigm."  By that he meant that the history of science is that
science began as an endeavor organized around empirical observation.
After that came the age of theory -- theorizing as the paradigm of
what science did.  Then science became computational, again meaning
that the paradigm of what science did was to calculate.  His argument
for a fourth era was that of a paradigm shift from computational
science to data intensive science.  You here at NRO need no primer
on the power of that shift in paradigm, but I am here to tell you
that cyber security is embracing that fourth paradigm and it is
doing it now.
Ecology professor Philip Greear would challenge his graduate students
to catalog all the life in a cubic yard of forest floor.  Computer
science professor Donald Knuth would challenge his graduate students
to catalog everything their computers had done in the last ten
seconds.  It is hard to say which is more difficult, but everywhere
you look, cyber security practitioners are trying to get a handle
on "What is normal?" so that that which is abnormal can be identified
early in the game.  Behavioral approaches leading towards intrusion
detection are exactly the search for anomaly, and they are data
based.  The now-famous attack on RSA Data Security that led to RSA
buying Net Witness is an example of wanting to know everything so
as to recognize something.  I'm on the record at book length [6]
that the central organizing principle behind a competent security
program is to instrument your data sufficiently well that nothing
moves without it being noticed.  Physics has made it possible to
put computers everywhere.  Physics has made it possible to fill
them all with data.
Cyber security is barely keeping up, and not just because of two,
three, or four orders of magnitude in the physics upstream of the
Trend  Need for prediction
We all know that knowledge is power.  We all know that there is a
subtle yet important distinction between information and knowledge.
We all know that a negative declaration like "X did not happen" can
be only proven if you have the enumeration of *everything* that did
happen and can show that X is not in it.  We all know that a stitch
in time saves nine, but only if we know where to put the stitch.
We all know that without security metrics, the outcome is either
overspending or under protecting.
The more technologic the society becomes, the greater the dynamic
range of possible failures.  When you live in a cave, starvation,
predators, disease, and lightning are about the full range of
failures that end life as you know it and you are well familiar
with all of them.  When you live in a technologic society where
everybody and everything is optimized in some way akin to just-in-time
delivery, the dynamic range of failures is incomprehensibly larger
and largely incomprehensible.  The wider the dynamic range of
failure, the more prevention is the watchword.  As technologic
society grows more interdependent within itself, the more it must
rely on prediction based on data collected in broad ways, not
targeted ways.
Some define risk as the probability of a failure times the cost of
that failure.  To be clear, a trend in favor of making predictions
is a trend subsidiary to a trend in the cost of failure.  I've
written at length elsewhere about how an increasing downside cost
of failure requires that we find ways to be resilient, but not
resilient in the sense of rich redundancy, not resilient in the
sense of having quick recovery mechanisms, but resilient in the
sense of having alternate primary means that do not share common
mode risks.  As such, I strongly recommend that manual means be
preserved wherever possible because whatever those manual means
are, they are already fully capitalized and they do not share common
mode risk with digital means.
There is now more information security risk sloshing around the
economy than could actually be accepted were it exposed.  The
tournament now turns to who can minimize their risk the best, which,
in the civilian economy at large, means who can most completely
externalize their downside information security costs.  The weapons
here are perhaps as simple as the wisdom of Delphi, "Know thyself"
and "Nothing to excess" -- know thyself in the sense of quantitative
rigor and a perpetual propensity to design information systems with
failure in mind; nothing to excess in the sense of mimicking the
biologic world's proof by demonstration that species diversity is
the greatest bulwark against loss of an ecosystem.
Trend  Abandonment
If I abandon a car on the street, then eventually someone will be
able to claim title.  If I abandon a bank account, then the State
will eventually seize it.  If I abandon real estate by failing to
remedy a trespass, then in the fullness of time adverse possession
takes over.  If I don't use my trademark, then my rights go over
to those who use what was and could have remained mine.  If I abandon
my spouse and/or children, then everyone is taxed to remedy my
actions.  If I abandon a patent application, then after a date
certain the teaching that it proposes passes over to the rest of
you.  If I abandon my hold on the confidentiality of data such as
by publishing it, then that data passes over to the commonweal not
to return.  If I abandon my storage locker, then it will be lost
to me and may end up on reality TV.  The list goes on.
Apple computers running 10.5 or less get no updates (comprising
about half the installed base).  Any Microsoft computer running XP
gets no updates (comprising about half the installed base).  The
end of security updates follows abandonment.  It is certainly ironic
that freshly pirated copies of Windows get security updates when
older versions bought legitimately do not.
Stating the obvious, if Company X abandons a code base, then that
code base should be open sourced.  Irrespective of security issues,
many is the time that a bit of software I use has gone missing
because its maker went missing.  But with respect to security, some
constellation of {I,we,they,you} are willing and able to provide
security patches or workarounds as time and evil require.
Would the public interest not be served, then, by a conversion to
open source for abandoned code bases?  But wait, you say, isn't
purchased software on a general purpose computer a thing of the
past?  Isn't the future auto-updated smartphone clients transacting
over armored private (carrier) networks to auto-updated cloud
services?  Maybe; maybe not.  If the two major desktop suppliers
update only half of today's desktops, then what percentage will
they update tomorrow?
If you say "Make them try harder!," then the legalistic, regulatory
position is your position, and the ACLU is already trying that
route.  If smartphone auto-update becomes a condition of merchantability
and your smartphone holds the keying material that undeniably says
that its user is you, then how long before a FISA court orders a
special auto-update to *your* phone for evidence gathering?
If you say "But we already know what they're going to do, don't
we?," then the question is what about the abandoned code bases.
Open-sourcing abandoned code bases is the worst option, except for
all the others.  But if seizing an abandoned code base is too big
a stretch for you before breakfast, then start with a Public Key
Infrastructure Certifying Authority that goes bankrupt and ask "Who
gets the keys?"
Trend  Interdependence
The essential character of a free society is this: That which is
not forbidden is permitted.  The essential character of an unfree
society is the inverse, that which is not permitted is forbidden.
The U.S. began as a free society without question; the weight of
regulation, whether open or implicit, can only push it toward being
unfree.  Under the pressure to defend against offenders with a
permanent structural advantage, defenders who opt for forbidding
anything that is not expressly permitted are cultivating a computing
environment that does not embody the freedom with which we are
heretofore familiar.
Put concretely, the central expression of a free society is a free
market, and the cardinal measure of a free market is the breadth
of real choice -- choice that goes beyond color and trim and body
style to choices that optimize discordant, antithetical goal states.
The level of choice on the Internet is draining down.  You may revel
in the hundreds of thousands of supposedly new voices that have
found a way to chatter in full view.  You may note that new "apps"
for Android plus iPhone are appearing at over a thousand per day.
You may rightly remind us all that technology is democratizing in
the sense that powers once reserved for the few are now irretrievably
in the hands of the many.  What stands against that, and why I say
that it stands against that, is increasing interdependence.
We humans can design systems more complex than we can then operate.
The financial sector's "flash crashes" are an example of that;
perhaps the fifty interlocked insurance exchanges for Obamacare
will soon be another.  Above some threshold of system complexity,
it is no longer possible to test, it is only possible to react to
emergent behavior.  The lowliest Internet user is entirely in the
game of interdependence -- one web page can easily touch scores of
different domains.  While writing this, the top level page from
cnn.com had 400 out-references to 85 unique domains each of which
is likely to be similarly constructed and all of which move data
one way or another.  If you leave those pages up and they have an
auto-refresh, then moving to a new network signals to every one of
those ad networks that you have so moved.
The wellspring of risk is dependence, especially dependence on
shared expectations of shared system state, i.e., interdependence
on the ground.  If you would accept that you are most at risk from
the things you most depend upon, then damping dependence is the
cheapest, most straightforward, lowest latency way to damp risk,
just as the fastest and most reliable way to put more money on a
business's bottom line is through cost control.
Trend  Automation
Shoshana Zuboff of the Harvard Business School notably described
three laws of the digital age,
. Everything that can be automated will be automated.
. Everything that can be informated will be informated.
. Every digital application that can be used for surveillance and
.    control will be used for surveillance and control.
It is irrelevant, immaterial and incompetent to argue otherwise.
For security technology, Zuboff's Laws are almost the goal state,
that is to say that the attempt to automate information assurance
is in full swing everywhere, the ability to extract information
from the observable is in full swing everywhere, and every digital
application is being instrumented.
Before In-Q-Tel, I worked for a data protection company.  Our product
was, and I believe still is, the most thorough on the market.  By
"thorough" I mean the dictionary definition, "careful about doing
something in an accurate and exact way."  To this end, installing
our product instrumented every system call on the target machine.
Data did not and could not move in any sense of the word "move"
without detection.  Every data operation was caught and monitored.
It was total surveillance data protection.  What made this product
stick out was that very thoroughness, but here is the point: Unless
you fully instrument your data handling, it is not possible for you
to say what did not happen.  With total surveillance, and total
surveillance alone, it is possible to treat the absence of evidence
as the evidence of absence.  Only when you know everything that
*did* happen with your data can you say what did *not* happen with
your data.
But this trend of automating is now leaving the purely defensive
position behind.  In a press release two weeks ago today,[7] DARPA
signaled exactly that, and I quote
   [T]he Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency intends to hold
   the Cyber Grand Challenge -- the first-ever tournament for fully
   automatic network defense systems.  DARPA envisions teams creating
   automated systems that would compete against each other to
   evaluate software, test for vulnerabilities, generate security
   patches and apply them to protected computers on a network.  The
   growth trends ... in cyber attacks and malware point to a future
   where automation must be developed...
The automation trend is irreversible, but it begs a question that
I fear no one will answer in a way that doesn't merely reflect their
corporate or institutional interest, namely are people in the loop
a failsafe or a liability?[8]
Trend  Dual use
I've become convinced that all security technology is dual use.
While I am not sure whether dual use is a trend or a realization
of an unchanging fact of nature, the obviousness of dual use seems
greatest in the latest technologies, so I am calling it a trend in
the sense that the straightforward accessibility of dual use
characteristics of new technology is a growing trend.
There are a lot of examples, but in the physical world any weapon
usable for defense can be repurposed for offense.  Every security
researcher looking for exploitable flaws is deep in the dual use
debate because once discovered, those flaws can be patched or they
can be sold.  The cyber security products that promise total
surveillance over the enterprise are, to my mind, an offensive
strategy used for defensive purposes.
There was a time when flaws were predominantly found by adventurers
and braggarts.  Ten plus years of good work by the operating system
vendors elbowed the flaw finders out of the operating system and,
as a result, our principal opponents changed over from adventurers
and braggarts to being professionals.  Finding vulnerabilities and
exploiting them is now hard enough that it has moved out of the
realm of being a hobby and into the realm of being a job.  This
changed several things, notably that braggarts share their findings
because they are paid in bragging rights.  By contrast, professionals
do not share and are paid in something more substantial than fame.
The side effect has been a continued rise in the percentage of all
vulnerabilities that are previously unknown.  The trend, in other
words, is that by crushing hobbyists we've raised the market price
of working exploits to where now our opponents pay for research and
development out of revenue.
Simulating what the opponent can do thus remains the central task
of defensive research.  Much of that research is in crafting proofs
of concept that such and such a flaw can be taken advantage of.
Corman's neologism of "HD Moore's Law" says that the trend in the
power of the casual attacker grows as does the trend of the power
in Metasploit.[9] It is hard to think of a better description of
dual use.
Trend  The blurring of end-to-end
To my mind, the most important technical decision ever made was
that the security of the Internet was to be "end-to-end."[10]
"End-to-end" is a generic technical term yet simple to explain: the
Internet was built on the premise that two entities could connect
themselves to each other and decide what they wanted to do.  The
network was a delivery vehicle, but the form, content, and security
of the connection between the two ends was to be their own choice.
End-to-end is a model where the terminal entities are smart and the
network is dumb.  This is completely (completely) different than a
smart network with dumb terminal entities at the end of the wire.
No other design decision of the Internet comes close to the importance
of it's being an end-to-end design.  With end-to-end, security is
the choice of the terminal end-points, not something built into the
fabric of the Internet itself.  That is American values personified.
It is the idea that accountability, not permission seeking, is the
way a government curbs the misuse of freedoms, and, as accountability
scales but permission seeking does not, accountability wins.
End-to-end security is the digital manifestation of the right of
association and, in any case, is what enabled the Internet to become
relevant in the first place.  End-to-end does precisely what Peter
Drucker told us to do: "Don't solve problems, create opportunities."
The provision of content from anywhere to anywhere, which is the
very purpose of an internetwork, is a challenge to sovereignty.
America's Founders wanted no sovereign at all, and they devised a
government that made the center all but powerless and the periphery
fully able to thumb its nose at whatever it felt like.  Much ink
has been spilled on the frontier ethic versus the wishful policies
favored by the comfortable urbanity of the welfare state, but the
Internet's protocols have everything in common with the former and
nothing in common with the latter.
The free man requires the choice of with what degree of vigor to
defend himself.  That is a universal; America's Founders laid that
down in the Second Amendment, just as did George Orwell in the
English democratic socialist weekly "Tribune" when he said, "That
rifle on the wall of the laborer's cottage or working class flat
is the symbol of democracy.  It is our job to see that it stays
there."  Were George Washington or George Orwell still among us,
they would know that smart end-points and dumb networks are what
freedom requires, that smart networks protecting dumb end-points
breed compliant dependency.
But the trend is otherwise, and not just because of the fatuous
fashionability of entitlement, but rather because of a blurring of
what the term "end" means.  So very many people have adopted automatic
synchronization of multiple devices they own that one has to ask
whether their tablet is an end or their collection of mutually
synchronized devices is an end.  So many Internet-dependent functions
are spread silently across numerous entities and applications that
what is the end may well be more dynamic than can be described.  If
an end implies unitary control on the part of an owner, then set
theory says that mutually synchronized devices are a unitary end.
That blurring of "end" makes end-to-end provisioning problematic
as a set of devices cannot be assumed to be equally on and equally
participating in any given transaction.  Quoting Clark & Blumenthal[11]
   There is a risk that the range of new requirements now emerging
   could have the consequence of compromising the Internet's original
   design principles.  Were this to happen, the Internet might lose
   some of its key features, in particular its ability to support
   new and unanticipated applications.  We link this possible outcome
   to a number of trends: the rise of new stakeholders in the
   Internet,...  new government interests, the changing motivations
   of the growing user base, and the tension between the demand for
   trustworthy overall operation and the inability to trust the
   behavior of individual users.
This is nowhere so evident as in security, that is to say in the
application of the end-to-end principle to cyber security.  What
does end-to-end secure transport mean when travelocity.com is showing
you a page dynamically constructed from a dozen other entities?
Trend  Complexity in the supply chain
Even without resorting to classified information, it is now clear
that supply chain attacks have occurred.  Whether reading journalistic
accounts or Richard Clarke's novel _Breakpoint_, the finding is
that the supply chain creates opportunities for badness.  None of
the things I've yet read, however, blames the supply chain risk on
its complexity, per se, but that is the trend that matters.
Security is non-composable -- we can get insecure results even when
our systems are assembled from secure components.  The more components,
the less likely a secure result.  This applies to supply chains
that are growing ever more complex under the pressure of just-in-time,
spot market sourcing of, say, memory chips and so forth and so on.
Because the attacker has only to find one component of that chain
to be vulnerable while the defender has to assure that all components
are invulnerable, rising supply chain complexity guarantees increased
opportunity for effective attack.  It cannot do otherwise, and the
trend is clear.
Trend  Monoculture(s)
Beginning with Forrest in 1997,[12] regular attention has been paid
to the questions of monoculture in the network environment.  There
is no point belaboring the fundamental question, but let me state
it for the record: cascade failure is so very much easier to detonate
in a monoculture -- so very much easier when the attacker has only
to write one bit of malware, not ten million.  The idea is obvious;
believing in it is easy; acting on its implications is, evidently,
rather hard.
I am entirely sympathetic to the actual reason we continue to deploy
computing monocultures -- making everything almost entirely alike
is, and remains, our only hope for being able to centrally manage
it in a consistent manner.  Put differently, when you deploy a
computing monoculture you are making a fundamental risk management
decision: That the downside risk of a black swan event is more
tolerable than the downside risk of perpetual inconsistency.  This
is a hard question, as all risk management is about changing the
future, not explaining the past.  Which would you rather have, the
unlikely event of a severe impact, or the day-to-day burden of
perpetual inconsistency?
When we opt for monocultures we had better opt for tight central
control.  This supposes that we are willing to face the risks that
come with tight central control, of course, including the maximum
risk of all auto-update schemes, namely the hostile takeover of the
auto-update mechanism itself.  Computer desktops are not the point;
embedded systems are.  The trendline in the number of critical
monocultures seems to be rising and many of these are embedded
systems both without a remote management interface and long lived.
That combination -- long lived and not reachable -- is the trend
that must be reversed.  Whether to insist that embedded devices
self destruct at some age or that remote management of them be a
condition of deployment is the question.  In either case, the
Internet of Things and the appearance of microcontrollers in seemingly
every computing device should raise hackles on every neck.[13]
Trend  Attack surface growth versus skill growth
Everyone here knows the terminology "attack surface" and knows that
one of the defender's highest goals is to minimize the attack surface
wherever possible.  Every coder adhering to a security-cognizant
software lifecycle program does this.  Every company or research
group engaged in static analysis of binaries does this.  Every
agency enforcing a need-to-know regime for data access does this.
Every individual who reserves one low-limit credit card for their
Internet purchases does this.  I might otherwise say that any person
who encrypts their e-mail to their closest counterparties does this,
but because consistent e-mail encryption is so rare, encrypting
one's e-mail marks it for collection and indefinite retention by
those entities in a position to do so, regardless of what country
you live in.
In cyber security practice, the trend is that we practitioners as
a class are getting better and better.  We have better tools, we
have better understood practices, and we have more colleagues.
That's the plus side.  But I'm interested in the ratio of skill to
challenge, and as far as I can estimate, we are expanding the
society-wide attack surface faster than we are expanding our
collection of tools, practices, and colleagues.  If you are growing
more food, that's great.  If your population is growing faster than
your improvements in food production can keep up, that's bad.
In the days of radio, there was Sarnoff's Law, namely that the value
of a broadcast network was proportional to N, the number of listeners.
Then came packetized network communications and Metcalfe's Law,
that the value of a network was proportional to N squared, the
number of possible two-way conversations.  We are now in the era
of Reed's Law where the value of a network is proportional to the
number of groups that can form in it, that is to say 2 to the power
N.  Reed's Law is the new reality because it fits the age of social
networks.  In each of these three laws as publicly stated, the sign
bit is positive, but in parallel with the claim that everything is
dual use, the sign bit can also be negative because interconnections
are a contributor to the net attack surface.  If an Internet of
Things is indeed imminent, then the upward bend in the curve of the
global attack surface will grow steeper regardless of what level
of risk there is for any one thing so long as that level of risk
is always non-zero.
Trend  Specialization
Everyone my age working in cyber security was trained for something
else, and because of that switch between one field and another
brings along the hybrid vigor of seeing the cyber security world
through a different lens.  Statisticians, civil engineers, and
lawyers alike can contribute.  But the increasing quality of prepatory
education, the increasing breadth of affairs for which cyber security
is needful, and the increasing demand for skill of the highest sort
means the humans in the game are specializing.
While some people like to say "Specialization is for insects," tell
me that the security field itself is not specializing.  We have
people who are expert in forensics on specific operating system
localizations, expert in setting up intrusion response, expert in
analyzing large sets of firewall rules using non-trivial set theory,
expert in designing egress filters for universities that have no
ingress filters, expert in steganographically watermarking binaries,
and so forth.  Generalists are becoming rare, and they are being
replaced by specialists.  This is biologic speciation in action,
and the narrowing of ecologic niches.  In rough numbers, there are
somewhere close to 5,000 various technical certifications you can
get in the computer field, and the number of them is growing thus
proving the conjecture of specialization and speciation is not just
for insects and it will not stop.

NSA tracking cellphone locations worldwide, Snowden documents show
By Barton Gellman and Ashkan Soltani, Wednesday, December 4, 12:18 PM
The National Security Agency is gathering nearly 5 billion records a
day on the whereabouts of cellphones around the world, according to
top-secret documents and interviews with U.S. intelligence officials,
enabling the agency to track the movements of individuals — and map
their relationships — in ways that would have been previously
The records feed a vast database that stores information about the
locations of at least hundreds of millions of devices, according to
the officials and the documents, which were provided by former NSA
contractorEdward Snowden. New projects created to analyze that data
have provided the intelligence community with what amounts to a mass
surveillance tool.
(Video: How the NSA uses cellphone tracking to find and ‘develop’ targets)
The NSA does not target Americans’ location data by design, but the
agency acquires a substantial amount of information on the whereabouts
of domestic cellphones “incidentally,” a legal term that connotes a
foreseeable but not deliberate result.
One senior collection manager, speaking on condition of anonymity but
with permission from the NSA, said “we are getting vast volumes” of
location data from around the world by tapping into the cables that
connect mobile networks globally and that serve U.S. cellphones as
well as foreign ones. Additionally, data is often collected from the
tens of millions of Americans who travel abroad with their cellphones
every year.
In scale, scope and potential impact on privacy, the efforts to
collect and analyze location data may be unsurpassed among the NSA
surveillance programsthat have been disclosed since June. Analysts can
find cellphones anywhere in the world, retrace their movements and
expose hidden relationships among individuals using them.
(Graphic: How the NSA is tracking people right now)
U.S. officials said the programs that collect and analyze location
data are lawful and intended strictly to develop intelligence about
foreign targets.
Robert Litt, general counsel for the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence, which oversees the NSA, said “there is no
element of the intelligence community that under any authority is
intentionally collecting bulk cellphone location information about
cellphones in the United States.”
The NSA has no reason to suspect that the movements of the
overwhelming majority of cellphone users would be relevant to national
security. Rather, it collects locations in bulk because its most
powerful analytic tools — known collectively as CO-TRAVELER — allow it
to look for unknown associates of known intelligence targets by
tracking people whose movements intersect.
Still, location data, especially when aggregated over time, is widely
regarded among privacy advocates as uniquely sensitive. Sophisticated
mathematical techniques enable NSA analysts to map cellphone owners’
relationships by correlating their patterns of movement over time with
thousands or millions of other phone users who cross their paths.
Cellphones broadcast their locations even when they are not being used
to place a call or send a text.
(Video: Reporter Ashkan Soltani explains NSA collection of cellphone data)
CO-TRAVELER and related tools require the methodical collection and
storage of location data on what amounts to a planetary scale. The
government is tracking people from afar into confidential business
meetings or personal visits to medical facilities, hotel rooms,
private homes and other traditionally protected spaces.
“One of the key components of location data, and why it’s so
sensitive, is that the laws of physics don’t let you keep it private,”
said Chris Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil
Liberties Union. People who value their privacy can encrypt their
e-mails and disguise their online identities, but “the only way to
hide your location is to disconnect from our modern communication
system and live in a cave.”
The NSA cannot know in advance which tiny fraction of 1 percent of the
records it may need, so it collects and keeps as many as it can — 27
terabytes, by one account, or more than double the text content of the
Library of Congress’s print collection.
The location programs have brought in such volumes of information,
according to a May 2012 internal NSA briefing, that they are
“outpacing our ability to ingest, process and store” data. In the
ensuing year and a half, the NSA has been transitioning to a
processing system that provided it with greater capacity.
The possibility that the intelligence community has been collecting
location data, particularly of Americans, has long concerned privacy
advocates and some lawmakers. Three Democratic senators — Ron Wyden
(Ore.), Mark Udall (Colo.) and Barbara Mikulski (Md.) — have
introduced an amendment to the 2014 defense spending bill that would
require U.S. intelligence agencies to say whether they have ever
collected or made plans to collect location data for “a large number
of United States persons with no known connection to suspicious
NSA Director Keith Alexander disclosed in Senate testimony in October
that the NSA had run a pilot project in 2010 and 2011 to collect
“samples” of U.S. cellphone location data. The data collected were
never available for intelligence analysis purposes, and the project
was discontinued because it had no “operational value,” he said.
Alexander allowed that a broader collection of such data “may be
something that is a future requirement for the country, but it is not
right now.”
The number of Americans whose locations are tracked as part of the
NSA’s collection of data overseas is impossible to determine from the
Snowden documents alone, and senior intelligence officials declined to
offer an estimate.
“It’s awkward for us to try to provide any specific numbers,” one
intelligence official said in a telephone interview. An NSA
spokeswoman who took part in the call cut in to say the agency has no
way to calculate such a figure.
An intelligence lawyer, speaking with his agency’s permission, said
location data are obtained by methods “tuned to be looking outside the
United States,” a formulation he repeated three times. When U.S.
cellphone data are collected, he said, the data are not covered by the
Fourth Amendment, which protects Americans against unreasonable
searches and seizures.
According to top-secret briefing slides, the NSA pulls in location
data around the world from 10 major “sigads,” or signals intelligence
activity designators.
A sigad known as STORMBREW, for example, relies on two unnamed
corporate partners described only as ARTIFICE and WOLFPOINT. According
to an NSA site inventory, the companies administer the NSA’s “physical
systems,” or interception equipment, and “NSA asks nicely for
STORMBREW collects data from 27 telephone links known as OPC/DPC
pairs, which refer to originating and destination points and which
typically transfer traffic from one provider’s internal network to
another’s. That data include cell tower identifiers, which can be used
to locate a phone’s location.
The agency’s access to carriers’ networks appears to be vast.
“Many shared databases, such as those used for roaming, are available
in their complete form to any carrier who requires access to any part
of it,” said Matt Blaze, an associate professor of computer and
information science at the University of Pennsylvania. “This ‘flat’
trust model means that a surprisingly large number of entities have
access to data about customers that they never actually do business
with, and an intelligence agency — hostile or friendly — can get ‘one
stop shopping’ to an expansive range of subscriber data just by
compromising a few carriers.”
Some documents in the Snowden archive suggest that acquisition of U.S.
location data is routine enough to be cited as an example in training
materials. In an October 2012 white paper on analytic techniques, for
example, the NSA’s counterterrorism analysis unit cites two U.S.-based
carriers to illustrate the challenge of correlating the travels of
phone users on different mobile networks. Asked about that, a U.S.
intelligence official said the example was poorly chosen and did not
represent the program’s foreign focus.
The NSA’s capabilities to track location are staggering, based on the
Snowden documents, and indicate that the agency is able to render most
efforts at communications security effectively futile.
Like encryption and anonymity tools online, which are used by
dissidents, journalists and terrorists alike, security-minded behavior
— using disposable cellphones and switching them on only long enough
to make brief calls — marks a user for special scrutiny. CO-TRAVELER
takes note, for example, when a new telephone connects to a cell tower
soon after another nearby device is used for the last time.
Side-by-side security efforts — when nearby devices power off and on
together over time — “assist in determining whether co-travelers are
associated … through behaviorally relevant relationships,” according
to the 24-page white paper, which was developed by the NSA in
partnership with the National Geospatial Agency, the Australian
Signals Directorate and private contractors.
A central feature of each of these tools is that they do not rely on
knowing a particular target in advance, or even suspecting one. They
operate on the full universe of data in the NSA’s FASCIA repository,
which stores trillions of metadata records, of which a large but
unknown fraction include locations.
The most basic analytic tools map the date, time, and location of
cellphones to look for patterns or significant moments of overlap.
Other tools compute speed and trajectory for large numbers of mobile
devices, overlaying the electronic data on transportation maps to
compute the likely travel time and determine which devices might have
To solve the problem of undetectable surveillance against CIA officers
stationed overseas, one contractor designed an analytic model that
would carefully record the case officer’s path and look for other
mobile devices in steady proximity.
“Results have not been validated by operational analysts,” the report said.

NSA morale down after Edward Snowden revelations, former U.S. officials say
By Ellen Nakashima, Published: December 7
Morale has taken a hit at the National Security Agency in the wake of
controversy over the agency’s surveillance activities, according to
former officials who say they are dismayed that President Obama has
not visited the agency to show his support.
A White House spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden, noted that top White House
officials have been to the agency to “express the president’s support
and appreciation for all that NSA does to keep us safe.”
It is not clear whether or when Obama might travel the 23 miles up the
Baltimore-Washington Parkway to visit Fort Meade, the NSA’s
headquarters in Maryland, but agency employees are privately voicing
frustration at what they perceive as White House ambivalence amid the
pounding the agency has taken from critics.
An NSA spokeswoman had no comment.
Obama in June defended the NSA’s surveillance as lawful and said he
welcomed the public debate prompted by revelations from former
contractor Edward Snowden beginning that month.
Though Obama has asserted, for instance, that the NSA’s collection of
virtually all Americans’ phone records is lawful and has saved lives,
the administration has not endorsed legislation that would codify it.
And his recent statements suggest he thinks some of the NSA’s
activities should be constrained.
A senior administration official who was not authorized to speak on
the record said that the White House would normally not endorse
legislation so early in the process but that “it’s been clear . . .
that we prefer legislation” that preserves the phone records program
“while making some changes . . . to potentially strengthen oversight
and transparency.”
Said Hayden: “The president has the highest respect for and pride in
the men and women of the intelligence community who work tirelessly to
protect our nation. He’s expressed that directly to NSA’s leadership
and has praised their work in public. As he said: ‘The men and women
of our intelligence community work every single day to keep us safe
because they love this country and believe in our values. They’re
patriots.’ ”
She noted that in recent weeks, Lisa Monaco, assistant to the
president for homeland security and counterterrorism, and Denis
McDonough, the White House chief of staff, visited Fort Meade “to
express the president’s support and appreciation for all that NSA does
to keep us safe.”’
Supporters of the NSA say staffers are not feeling the love.
“The agency, from top to bottom, leadership to rank and file, feels
that it is had no support from the White House even though it’s been
carrying out publicly approved intelligence missions,” said Joel
Brenner, NSA inspector general from 2002 to 2006. “They feel they’ve
been hung out to dry, and they’re right.”
A former U.S. official — who like several other former officials
interviewed for this story requested anonymity because he still has
dealings with the agency — said: “The president has multiple
constituencies — I get it. But he must agree that the signals
intelligence NSA is providing is one of the most important sources of
intelligence today.
“So if that’s the case, why isn’t the president taking care of one of
the most important elements of the national security apparatus?”
The White House, observers say, is caught between competing desires to
preserve what it has said are valuable national security programs and
to shield the president from criticism from allies abroad and
civil-liberties advocates at home.
Some observers said it is not surprising that Obama would not travel
to Fort Meade before internal and external reviews of surveillance
activities have been completed. The reviews are expected to be done
The NSA’s director, Gen. Keith Alexander, who is retiring in the
spring after 81 / 2 years, has been the most vocal defender of the
agency’s 35,000 employees. In speeches he has noted that more than
6,000 of them went to Iraq and Afghanistan to support the military. He
has spoken of how 22 cryptologists were killed. “They’re the heroes —
not the media leaker,” he said in a September speech, in a reference
to Snowden.
NSA counterterrorism analysts have worked “every weekend for eight
years since I’ve been here. . . . Twenty-four hours a day, seven days
a week, they’re there to defend us,” he said then.
On Thursday, Obama said on MSNBC that he would be proposing “some
self-restraint on the NSA” and “some reforms that can give people more
In an interview with NBC last month, he said: “In some ways, the
technology and the budgets and the capacity [at NSA] have outstripped
the constraints. And we’ve got to rebuild those in the same way that
we’re having to do on a whole series of capacities . . . [such as]
drone operations.”
Civil-liberties advocates generally agree with that sentiment, but
they would go further and say that the NSA’s bulk collection of
domestic phone records is unlawful and ought to be ended.
Former officials note how President George W. Bush paid a visit to the
NSA in January 2006, in the wake of revelations by the New York Times
that the agency engaged in a counterterrorism program of warrantless
surveillance on U.S. soil beginning after the Sept. 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks. “Bush came out and spoke to the workforce, and the
effect on morale was tremendous,” Brenner said. “There’s been nothing
like that from this White House.”
A second former official said NSA workers are polishing up their
résumés and asking that they be cleared — removing any material linked
to classified programs — so they can be sent out to potential
employers. He noted that one employee who processes the résumés said,
“I’ve never seen so many résumés that people want to have cleared in
my life.”
Morale is “bad overall,” a third former official said. “The news — the
Snowden disclosures — it questions the integrity of the NSA
workforce,” he said. “It’s become very public and very personal.
Literally, neighbors are asking people, ‘Why are you spying on
Grandma?’ And we aren’t. People are feeling bad, beaten down.”

to be specific: it is this certification step that fully open source
SDR/baseband equipment manufacturers have difficultly with.  E.g. the
FCC plainly states systems  "wholly dependent on open source elements”
would have a “high burden” to demonstrate their security during the
certification process.  where many have taken "high burden" to mean
"nearly impossible"...

some items to note:
- is this DUAL_EC_DRNG? don't think so. deadline is FY 2013.
- is this DUAL_EC_DRNG? the market for closed source, proprietary
crypto solutions is small (and growing smaller, :(
- is this XSTORE? it's been a while. but never should have been used
directly. see mtrngd with MSR bits set no whitening, max sample, max

@_subject: Fwd: [zs-p2p] [Cryptography] Fwd: [IP] 'We cannot trust' Intel and 
I think there may be weaknesses in Intel's hardware RNG.  I took a
good look at Intel's hardware random number generator source. There's
a paper analyzing it here:
The basic idea is that back-to-back inverters, when powered on, flip
one way or the other randomly, sort of like DRAM memory when our
computer's power on.  By powering on a single pair of back-to-back
inverters over and over, they can generate a random bit per cycle, at
about 3 Giga-bits/second, which is amazing!  Here's my concerns about
the the paper:
- I saw no mathematical analysis of how much noise exists in the
system and how strongly it will influence the result each cycle. There
were generalities about how the noise could cause the output to be
random, but no numbers at all.
- There is an assumption that the capacitors are charged/discharged by
10% of the standard deviation of the noise.  I saw no justification
for this.  It seems they simply assumed best case.
- The paper is about as objective as a mother talking about her
children.  For example: "Overall, the Ivy Bridge RNG is a robust
design with a large margin of safety that ensures good random data is
generated even if the ES is not operating as well as predicted." Based
on what?
- I am not convinced they have the right model for the entropy source.
 They add noise to the bias on the capacitors, and compare that to 0
to determine the next output bit in their model.  I think the main
source of noise may be the randomness in number of electrons
added/subtracted each cycle, and that the back-to-back inverters in
the absence of other noise may be acting almost as an ideal
comparator.  However, if this were the case, even if there were 10%
noise in the number of electrons, there would be considerable
correlation between bits.
I also have questions about the design itself.  My main concern is
that noise on the VDD rail could easily determine the output.  For
example, if the transistors are mismatched, which of course they will
be, and the bias is set exactly right on the caps so there's a 50-50
chance of a 0 or 1, and suddenly VDD drops 10% due to a rising edge of
the the main system clock, then the inverter with higher gate
thresholds will become weak faster than the other one, thus
determining which one wins.  Since this circuit runs asynchronously
from the main system clock, I could easily see the 3MHz system clock
phase relative to the entropy generator clock determining most of the
results from the entropy source, while looking fairly random. Any
weakness in the raw random data stream is hidden from us by the AES
encryption done as a post-process.
I simulated back-to-back inverters in my .35u low power CMOS process
in SPICE to see if I could figure out how to make a practical circuit
using Intel's topology.  If it works, it would be fantastic.  I think
I can get rid of most of the supply noise issues.  I had a similar
problem in my "Infinite Noise Multiplier", so I switched to powering
the circuit with nothing but large W and L constant current sources,
and using the range from 0V to Vref, rather than 0V to VDD, because
Vref is stable relative to AVSS. However, I wasn't able to get enough
noise to make Intel's ciruit work, though that may be due to
limitations in the SPICE simulator.
Has anyone else had success using Intel's RNG topology?

@_subject: Fwd: [zs-p2p] [Cryptography] Fwd: [IP] 'We cannot trust' Intel and 
I have to take back my criticism of Intel's RNG.  I got my sims
working for a version of their architecture in .35u CMOS, and it's
simply better than my "Infinite Noise Multiplier".  It's probably the
best true random noise generator ever.  I still don't like how their
schematic is seems highly sensitive to supply noise, but we don't know
what the actual circuit looks like.  Intel hasn't told us.
So, I'm going to modify it a bit to use the resistors available on my
chip and reduce the caps, fix the supply sensitivity, and I think I
can run 16 of these things in parallel at 100-200MHz on the tiny .35u
CMOS chip I'm designing.  I'll spit out the raw waveforms from the
inverters, buffered once, through 16 "analog" pins, so there wont be
any fear (hopefully) that I'm cooking the data on-chip, before you can
see it, and I'll open-source the schematics.  If there's a circuit
that can consume all 1.6Gbit/sec of this raw data, have fun with it!
On the digital side, I'll XOR bits together to get the bandwidth down
to something reasonable, which I can send over USB, and provide a
simple Linux driver.
This thing will definitely put out RF, but since I'm making the raw
data available at the pins, should I care?  By the way, this is just a
for-fun project at work.  I get to do a free chip design :-)

the partnership with NGA to deploy them gives a hint: this is putting
USRPs up close and personal to target for exploitation.

given the obtained bits mentioned (WLLids, DSL accounts, Cookies,
GooglePREFIDs) gathered and then handed off to TAO for further QUANTUM
INSERT fucking of target systems it is likely they are doing GSM/cell
MitM to observe identifiers, along with WiFi attacks, and other egress
rather than deploying baseband exploits or deep active attacks
directly against the devices or other networks they're communicating
thus CNE in this case is cell MitM/WiFi pwn with a USRP rogue tower to
get identifiers for TAO.  and TAO is where they get dirty with "remote
exploitation" of the device itself and other targets on networks it
we've seen how they have a smorgasbord of weaponized exploits to cover
the gamut of target hardware and technical acumen in the QUANTUM

see also this section on the OPEC hacks:
Here’s how the NSA and GCHQ go after an organization like OPEC step by
step, based on an analysis of the NSA and GCHQ documents exposed by
Step 1: Identify. Using the NSA-built packet capture and inspection
system called TURMOIL, the agencies filter through Internet traffic at
a network choke point looking for specific "fingerprints" in traffic
that identify users with the organization being targeted. Data from
TURMOIL gets pulled into a number of traffic analysis tools, such as
XKeyscore and TRAFFICTHIEF, which do different sorts of packet
XKeyscore is the NSA's distributed search engine, catching a large
chunk of international Internet traffic for analysis. It helps find
things deep in the clutter of the Internet that analysts might miss by
allowing them to use search terms to find things in both live and
cached Internet traffic.
TRAFFICTHIEF, on the other hand, is much more focused. It filters for
very "strong" indicators, like known sets of IP addresses, addresses
within e-mail traffic, or user names in logins to social networks or
other services. It provides less depth of analysis than XKeyscore, but
it can handle much larger loads of data because it is more selective
about what it processes.
Together, the tools can be used to identify the systems used by an
individual or organization, including ranges of addresses that they
may use from work or home.
Step 2: Target. Using the profiles built using the surveillance tools,
the agencies can then identify potential points of attack. XKeyscore,
for example, can be used to search for patterns that identify known
security vulnerabilities within a range of addresses. Web visit
histories, e-mail traffic, and other data are analyzed looking for the
most likely (and least detectable) approach to gain access, and a
specific attack plan is crafted, including the identification of where
to launch the attack from.
At the NSA, this sort of thing is the work of Tailored Access
Operations. In the case of OPEC, the targeting process apparently went
on for several years as the NSA sought openings for an attack.
Step 3: Attack. Depending on who the target is, the NSA and GCHQ have
a variety of options. The least costly is to use access provided by
one of the intelligence agencies' telecommunications "partners" who
own network equipment at an exchange or other choke point that the
target's Internet traffic passes through. The agency running the
attack can use that access to introduce changes to Internet routing
tables that detour the targeted individual's traffic. But in some
cases, the NSA and GCHQ may have to perform "unilateral" taps on
network backbones to gain that level of access—targeting a piece of
network hardware to take over or splicing directly into the target's
own connection to the Internet.
It's not clear which attack the NSA used to gain access to OPEC's
systems, though the GCHQ used a Quantum attack two years later to gain
its own very special access to the cartel's network. In the case of
the Belgacom hack, the GCHQ used a Quantum insert attack—routing the
Web requests for LinkedIn and Slashdot from the engineer being
targeted to a server posing as those sites. The NSA has used the same
approach to intercept traffic to sites such as Google.
The man-in-the-middle server can present content from the actual sites
the target intended to visit, but it can also add content to the
traffic, using what's called packet injection—modifying the contents
of the data as it passes through—and intercept the user's credentials.
And by using a forged certificate, the NSA can intercept encrypted
traffic intended for the destination site.
Once the user has connected to the fake server, the intelligence
agencies can use the connection to launch attacks against the target's
Web browser to install monitoring software or other malware, using
similar techniques to those used by hackers. They can also use
credentials exposed via the man-in-the-middle attack to gain access to
other accounts owned by the target and to troll through connections in
those services that might be potential targets.
Step 4: Exploit. Once the target's computer has been successfully
attacked, the effort begins to look much like that of the Chinese
cyber warriors' attack of the New York Times or what cyber criminals
typically do when they score access to high-value targets. The
agencies' hackers work to stealthily expand their level of access,
using customized remote administration tools to grab user privileges
and gain access to other network resources—mail servers, file servers,
and other network systems. They then start to "exfiltrate" data from
these systems and deliver them to analysts.

"used in Virtual Private Network" == PPTP,IPsec,OpenVPN,etc.
"Web encryption devices" == in my interpretation, this is any targeted
hardware with the vulnerable chip.  it could be a tablet, a desktop,
and rack mount server...  any of these platforms could speak VPN or
Web crypto.  TAO/SCS do like to get into the switches though ;)
mostly "cloud infrastructure", "software defined data center", and the like:
back in the day, Sun got tired of the (relatively) slow performance
and latency of crypto offloading via bus and simply threw it into the
core.  you were still offloading crypto, but within the CPU.
also note that endpoint compromises sufficient to decrypt VPN or
secure web traffic is already present in TAO/CNE's tasking.  this
effort [CCP_00009] may focus on VPN concentrator / secure web proxy
deployments specifically to handle the RDRAND lookup per their private
starting counter.
previous back doors have also used entropy leakage sufficient to bring
a brute force attack into reasonable effort, while still denying third
parties a class break of the entropy / keys used.  this type of key
space search is not done on the ground with portable CNE but instead
back at SCS...
on a related tangent, the lack of additional disclosures is quite
frustrating.  this entire conversation would be resolved in a glance
if $the_snowden_gatekeepers were acting in the public interest.  :/

Ok, given those requirements. Who fits the bill?
High end platform:
Intel targets what it believes is a significant growth opportunity to
bring the Intel Architecture into a rapidly evolving networking space.
Intel added to its portfolio with the introduction of the Highland
Forest platform, which combines the vendor’s Xeon E5-2600 v2 CPU with
its new Coleto Creek chipset. Price said Highland Forest – which can
pack up to 20 2.4GHz “Ivy Bridge” CPU cores – will offer two to six
times the performance of the previous Crystal Forest platform, which
was launched in October 2012.
Highland Forest, with Intel’s Data Plane Development Kit, can deliver
up to 255 million packets per second (p/s) – more than the 140 million
p/s from Crystal Forest – as well as security capabilities of 110
Gigabits per second of IPsec and 200 Gb/s SSL security for encrypted
IPsec (VPN) and SSL (Web crypto) and lots of it!  sounds interesting.
tell me more!
other market points of note:
- "Intel currently has over 15 SDN/NFV qualification trials underway
with carriers in all major regions.  Schooler emphasized that Intel
has no intention to sell directly to service providers and is fully
committed to launching an Intel Network Builders Ecosystem of industry
players supporting the Intel Architecture."
- "6WIND Announces Availability of Support for Intel® Xeon® Processor

funny they seem to distance themselves from "Highland Forest" and "Ivy

hey Wind River, how are you using RDRAND?
now what about Intel themselves, are they also pushing the chip?
Intel officials are making aggressive moves to expand the reach of its
silicon beyond servers and into other parts of the data centre.
Schooler said the company has been making products for networking gear
for about a decade, and has made significant strides in recent years.
It’s also made several acquisitions – such as of Sensory Networks,
Ethernet chip maker Fulcrum Microsystems and networking software maker
Aepona, whose technology enables telecoms and cloud service providers
to offer more services on their networks.
Intel is looking to take advantage of the growth opportunity
networking represents, Schooler said. The market Intel is targeting is
about $16 billion (£9.7bn), and the chip maker currently has about 5
percent of it. Along with its x86 architecture, Intel also is
developing accelerator chips for such jobs as packet inspection and
whew.  that's a lot of context and circumstance.  let's look back over
your goals for 2013:

i will admit that i am continually impressed by NSA/SCS achievements.

special collection of many of them (20+) handling tier-1 core traffic
encryption, which is an excellent point to aggregate a vulnerability
in keying ciphers. (ignore public key for now, since we can just focus

this does bring up an interesting point:
while it may be more efficient to use the same "key" for the DRBG
output across all processor lines, it would be more secure to use a
different key per line.  this implies that each iteration of Sandy
Bridge -> Ivy Bridge -> Haswell needs to be "enabled" by CCP, with
Xeon E5 debut in 2013 as discussed.
for Sandy Bridge, this would have shown in 2010? and unless in network
equipment described simply as "enabling decryption for Sandy Bridge
used by $operating systems and $applications."
sadly we'll have to wait a while to confirm this conjecture for
Haswell.  and we'll have to wait forever for more leaks apparently, as

Certivox Asked That We Share Their Side of the Story on the PrivateSky Takedown.
The real story on the PrivateSky takedown.
Posted by Brian Spector on Thu, Dec 12, 2013
With the story about our PrivateSky takedown now public, I want to
take the opportunity to clarify a few points in various articles that
have appeared since yesterday covering the story.
Some headlines strongly infer our friends at GCHQ "forced" us to take
PrivateSky down. That's not the case.
Secondly, a very important point wasn't printed. GCHQ couldn't, by
law, request a blanket back door on the system. There are a very rigid
set of controls that mean only specific individuals can come under
surveillance. The legal request for such surveillance has a due
process that must be stridently followed. At no time did I or anyone
at CertiVox talk about CertiVox in relation to any RIPA warrant, only
the generic process by which these warrants are served.
By saying "our friends at GCHQ", there is no facetiousness intended.
The team at CertiVox have the upmost respect for the folks we
interacted with at GCHQ. They took the due process I outlined in the
previous point very seriously. We found that as an organisation, and
every individual involved there, were as worried about a breach of
public trust as much as we are.
Finally, I believe very strongly the following should be a larger part
of the public discourse of these subjects. What everyone needs to
understand is that every developed democracy in the world, even where
privacy rights are enshrined to the maximum efficacy by statute, has
laws on the books that mandate that Internet Service Providers have
facilities to work with law enforcement for the purposes of legal
intercept, to enforce public safety and security.
Being L.I. capable is a very important set features and functions that
must be in place for any credible, commercial service on the Internet.
In endeavouring to make PrivateSky as secure as possible, we
overlooked this critical requirement when we built PrivateSky.
When CertiVox positioned PrivateSky as the easiest to use and most
secure encrypted messaging service, we really had two significant
points of differentiation. First, even though we held the root
encryption keys to the system, it was architected in such as way that
it would have been all but impossible for our internal staff to snoop
on our customer's communications, or for the service to leak any of
our customer¹s data. Secondly, our possession of the root keys, and
our use of identity based encryption, made the system incredibly easy
to use. For the user, there were no private or public keys to manage,
every workflow was handled for the user in an easy to grasp pure HTML5
interface, no hardware or software required, just an HTML5 browser.
We boxed ourselves into a feature set and market position that when
called upon to comply with legal statues, we simply had no alternative
but to shut the service down. We built it, but we couldn't host it.
Why? Because as you can probably surmise, there is an inherent
impedance mismatch between being able to host a commercial
communications service that gives the upmost in privacy to its users,
against any breach, whilst at the same time being able to operate
safely within the confines of the law as it is on the books in most
countries on the planet.
In summary, it's the abuse of the communications interception in the
Snowden revelations that has everyone up in arms, as so it should. But
that¹s not what happened with PrivateSky.

ah FSB; you crack me up!
'''A senior officer of Russian counter-intelligence said: "Although

I am pretty sure that kidnaping the former NSA employee will be

Edward Snowden can be kidnapped from Russia?
10.12.2013 14:57
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of NSA's total control systems can
be kidnapped from Russia. This is a priority for the British MI-6 and
the British Embassy, former NSA agent Wayne Madsen said, referring to
his colleagues.
Of course, nothing is known whether the CIA received the task, and
whether the U.S. Embassy is going to be involved in the activities to
try to kidnap Snowden. However, the British Embassy has already
tracked calls and letters of Snowden's "inner circle" and begun to
"dig up" their contacts in Moscow.
According to The Guardian, Snowden has the information, the disclosure
of which could become a nightmare for the U.S., even though the
fugitive NSA specialist decided not to disclose some of his data. In
addition, The Guardianadmitted that the media have so far published
"only 1%" of available information about NSA's total control over
billions of people in different countries.
Nevertheless, even this one percent has already made the UK
authorities introduce outright censorship against those who reveal
secrets of "global surveillance."
In particular, Wayne Madsen said that his girlfriend, who previously
worked for the National Security Agency as an expert on the Russian
language, tried to contact Snowden's acquaintances. Afterwards, she
was invited to come to the British Embassy and undergo special
training. She was also asked to report of FSB's interest in her
persons and communications.
The press quoted a former NSA expert, who said that the job to find
Snowden was of the highest priority for the embassy. Moreover, it was
said that the future operation to kidnap him involved number one MI-6
officer at the embassy, who worked under diplomatic cover as the
director for regional security.
The Center for the Study of Globalization has previously reported that
should the operation be successful, Snowden would be delivered to the
UK or the U.S. For the time being, the flywheel of total wiretapping
that Snowden launched was working against him to the utmost. "MI-6
intelligence agencies have begun to analyze the information they were
able to obtain through intelligence," the statement from the center
A senior officer of Russian counter-intelligence, whom Politonline.ru
confidentially managed to talk to, said: "Although the Federal
Security Bureau does not do anything about human rights activist
Snowden, the service has been active in counterintelligence. I am
pretty sure that kidnaping the former NSA employee will be
dramatically challenging." He also thanked "former NSA employees and
journalists for publishing such information, but added that
operational, technical and other measures to counter intelligence and
other illegal activities of foreign secret services on the territory
of Russia were  constantly maintained.
It only remains to add that the CIA has recently created a special
section in Russian on its official website, in which the department
offered Russian citizens (!) to join American intelligence. To choose
from, for example, the CIA offers engineering and technical
directions, a linguistic job, a secret agent with the knowledge of
Russian language and experts in business and analysts. The CIA
reportedly hopes to obtain classified information from newcomers in
the above areas to establish a new database of agents.

Full Disclosure as per the FreeBSD announcement[0] and others[1][2] direct use of
RDRAND as sole entropy source is not recommended.
from Westmere onward you could use AES-NI to make crypto fast in
OpenSSL.  a common theme is to initialize OpenSSL via
ENGINE_load_builtin_engines() which lets OpenSSL take advantage of
this acceleration.
with Sandy Bridge you also got RDRAND. now load_builtin_engines
results in the application using RDRAND directly for all entropy, in
addition to accelerating AES.
if you are using an application linked with openssl-1.0.1-beta1
through openssl-1.0.1e you should do one of the following:
a.) rebuild your OpenSSL with OPENSSL_NO_RDRAND defined.
b.) call RAND_set_rand_engine(NULL) after ENGINE_load_builtin_engines().
c.) git pull latest openssl with commit: "Don't use rdrand engine as
default unless explicitly requested." - Dr. Stephen Henson
the OPENSSL_NO_RDRAND option is recommended; an inadvertent call to
load engines elsewhere could re-enable this bad rng behavior.

- region detect individual chars per row image then assign char value via OCR
- insert human in loop to confirm / correct OCR row by row

it's legit.
on a more serious note, regarding the assumption:
 "if everything is backdoored already, essentially key escrow exists"
NSA has stated that many of their BULLRUN techniques are incredibly
fragile.  a number of them now burned in leaks, many yet to get
stuffed. if they "did it risky"[0], perhaps feeling emboldened by the
seeming success of Dual_EC_DRBG and friends, a common key / reduction
hidden behind AES-128 rounds could be discovered, independently
confirmed, and properly attributed.
so not only can the backdoors be broken up, replacements which are
resistant to compromise will take their stead.  "everything" becomes
"much" becomes "very little" until ideally such invasive tactics are
reserved for HUMINT tasked "good ol'e detective work" with legal
bonafides judged according to public laws and applicable to all
persons on earth, not just tribal deference pointed inward.
the jury is out; there are encouraging signs... but first, back to

your understanding is flawed.  let me clarify:
the NSA does not currently break Tor on demand at the protocol level.
all indications are this is currently true.
the NSA and others have great success around Tor by opportunistically
watching users fuck up (see other usability thread), by pwning their
horribly insecure systems (0days as far as the eye can see..), and by
actively manipulating user paths to the Tor network or destination
"forget your global passive adversary threats, active denial and
manipulation of service attacks are _really_ scary!"
said another way, breaking Tor at protocol level is currently too
expensive a solution to the same ends provided by much cheaper means.

Towards Efficient Traffic-analysis Resistant Anonymity Networks
Stevens LeBlond, David Choffnes, Wenxuan Zhou, Peter Druschel, Hitesh
Ballani, and Paul Francis
August 2013
Existing IP anonymity systems tend to sacrifice one of low latency,
high bandwidth, or resistance to traffic-analysis. High-latency
mix-nets like Mixminion batch messages to resist traffic-analysis at
the expense of low latency. Onion routing schemes like Tor deliver low
latency and high bandwidth, but are not designed to withstand traffic
analysis. Designs based on DC-nets or broadcast channels resist
traffic analysis and provide low latency, but are limited to low
bandwidth communication.
In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation
of Aqua, a high bandwidth anonymity system that resists traffic
analysis. We focus on providing strong anonymity for BitTorrent, and
evaluate the performance of Aqua using traces from hundreds of
thousands of actual Bit-Torrent users. We show that Aqua achieves
latency low enough for efficient bulk TCP flows, bandwidth sufficient
to carry BitTorrent traffic with reasonable efficiency, and resistance
to traffic analysis within anonymity sets of hundreds of clients. We
conclude that Aqua represents an interesting new point in the space of
anonymity network designs.

We were somewhere in San Francisco on the edge of the 56th IETF when
the drugs began to take hold.  I remember saying something like "I
feel a bit
lightheaded; maybe you should take notes...."  And suddenly there was a
terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge
OIDs, all swooping and screeching and diving around the RFC, which was about a
hundred pages long.  And a voice was screaming: "Holy Jesus!  Where are these
goddamn business cases?"
Then it was quiet again.  My attorney had taken his shirt off and was pouring
beer into his mouth, to facilitate the PKI standards-creation process.  "What

once you get into a serious PKI RFC binge, the tendency is to push it as far
as you can.  The only thing that really worried me was the X.500.  There is

Wyden estimates that he gets about fifteen minutes a year to ask
questions of top intelligence officials at open hearings. With the
help of his intelligence staffer, John Dickas, a thirty-five-year-old
from Beaverton, Oregon, whom Wyden calls “the hero of the
intelligence-reform movement,” Wyden often spends weeks preparing his
questions. He and Dickas look for opportunities to interrogate
officials on the gaps between what they say in public and what they
say in classified briefings. At a technology conference in Nevada the
previous summer, General Keith Alexander, the director of the N.S.A.,
had said that “the story that we have millions or hundreds of millions
of dossiers on people is absolutely false.” Wyden told me recently,
“It sure didn’t sound like the world I heard about in private.” For
months, he tried to get a clarification from the N.S.A. about exactly
what Alexander had meant. Now he had the opportunity to ask Clapper in
public. As a courtesy, he had sent him the question the day before.
Wyden leaned forward and read Alexander’s comment. Then he asked,
“What I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to
the question ‘Does the N.S.A. collect any type of data at all on
millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?’ ”
Clapper slouched in his chair. He touched the fingertips of his right
hand to his forehead and made a fist with his left hand.
“No, sir,” he said. He gave a quick shake of his head and looked down
at the table.
“It does not?” Wyden asked, with exaggerated surprise.
“Not wittingly,” Clapper replied. He started scratching his forehead
and looked away from Wyden. “There are cases where they could
inadvertently perhaps collect, but not wittingly.”
Wyden told me, “The answer was obviously misleading, false.”

@_subject: acoustic side channel attacks against TEMPEST shielded equipment 
interesting work on using poor quality sound (like from a phone) for
chosen cipher text attacks with key recovery for GPG.
also note that they use frequencies >10kHz.  as discussed in the high
frequency audio covert channel, this range is fairly contention free
and easily accessible to microphones in consumer electronics of
various types.
Here, we describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis key extraction attack,
applicable to GnuPG's current implementation of RSA. The attack can
extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of
various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the
computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We
experimentally demonstrate that such attacks can be carried out, using
either a plain mobile phone placed next to the computer, or a more
sensitive microphone placed 4 meters away.
Beyond acoustics, we demonstrate that a similar low-bandwidth attack
can be performed by measuring the electric potential of a computer
chassis. A suitably-equipped attacker need merely touch the target
computer with his bare hand, or get the required leakage information
from the ground wires remote end of VGA, USB or Ethernet

Inside TAO
Documents Reveal Top NSA Hacking Unit
By SPIEGEL Staff
The NSA's TAO hacking unit is considered to be the intelligence
agency's top secret weapon. It maintains its own covert network,
infiltrates computers around the world and even intercepts shipping
deliveries to plant back doors in electronics ordered by those it is
In January 2010, numerous homeowners in San Antonio, Texas, stood
baffled in front of their closed garage doors. They wanted to drive to
work or head off to do their grocery shopping, but their garage door
openers had gone dead, leaving them stranded. No matter how many times
they pressed the buttons, the doors didn't budge. The problem
primarily affected residents in the western part of the city, around
Military Drive and the interstate highway known as Loop 410.
In the United States, a country of cars and commuters, the mysterious
garage door problem quickly became an issue for local politicians.
Ultimately, the municipal government solved the riddle. Fault for the
error lay with the United States' foreign intelligence service, the
National Security Agency, which has offices in San Antonio. Officials
at the agency were forced to admit that one of the NSA's radio
antennas was broadcasting at the same frequency as the garage door
openers. Embarrassed officials at the intelligence agency promised to
resolve the issue as quickly as possible, and soon the doors began
opening again.
It was thanks to the garage door opener episode that Texans learned
just how far the NSA's work had encroached upon their daily lives. For
quite some time now, the intelligence agency has maintained a branch
with around 2,000 employees at Lackland Air Force Base, also in San
Antonio. In 2005, the agency took over a former Sony computer chip
plant in the western part of the city. A brisk pace of construction
commenced inside this enormous compound. The acquisition of the former
chip factory at Sony Place was part of a massive expansion the agency
began after the events of Sept. 11, 2001.
On-Call Digital Plumbers
One of the two main buildings at the former plant has since housed a
sophisticated NSA unit, one that has benefited the most from this
expansion and has grown the fastest in recent years -- the Office of
Tailored Access Operations, or TAO. This is the NSA's top operative
unit -- something like a squad of plumbers that can be called in when
normal access to a target is blocked.
According to internal NSA documents viewed by SPIEGEL, these on-call
digital plumbers are involved in many sensitive operations conducted
by American intelligence agencies. TAO's area of operations ranges
from counterterrorism to cyber attacks to traditional espionage. The
documents reveal just how diversified the tools at TAO's disposal have
become -- and also how it exploits the technical weaknesses of the IT
industry, from Microsoft to Cisco and Huawei, to carry out its
discreet and efficient attacks.
The unit is "akin to the wunderkind of the US intelligence community,"
says Matthew Aid, a historian who specializes in the history of the
NSA. "Getting the ungettable" is the NSA's own description of its
duties. "It is not about the quantity produced but the quality of
intelligence that is important," one former TAO chief wrote,
describing her work in a document. The paper seen by SPIEGEL quotes
the former unit head stating that TAO has contributed "some of the
most significant intelligence our country has ever seen." The unit, it
goes on, has "access to our very hardest targets."
A Unit Born of the Internet
Defining the future of her unit at the time, she wrote that TAO "needs
to continue to grow and must lay the foundation for integrated
Computer Network Operations," and that it must "support Computer
Network Attacks as an integrated part of military operations." To
succeed in this, she wrote, TAO would have to acquire "pervasive,
persistent access on the global network." An internal description of
TAO's responsibilities makes clear that aggressive attacks are an
explicit part of the unit's tasks. In other words, the NSA's hackers
have been given a government mandate for their work. During the middle
part of the last decade, the special unit succeeded in gaining access
to 258 targets in 89 countries -- nearly everywhere in the world. In
2010, it conducted 279 operations worldwide.
Indeed, TAO specialists have directly accessed the protected networks
of democratically elected leaders of countries. They infiltrated
networks of European telecommunications companies and gained access to
and read mails sent over Blackberry's BES email servers, which until
then were believed to be securely encrypted. Achieving this last goal
required a "sustained TAO operation," one document states.
This TAO unit is born of the Internet -- created in 1997, a time when
not even 2 percent of the world's population had Internet access and
no one had yet thought of Facebook, YouTube or Twitter. From the time
the first TAO employees moved into offices at NSA headquarters in Fort
Meade, Maryland, the unit was housed in a separate wing, set apart
from the rest of the agency. Their task was clear from the beginning

out of time, barest gist til next year: back when doing wifi security
research and other interests [trunc.] received an FBI black bag job;
presumably physical focus due to non standard OSes and FDE.  IBM
keyboard internal chip replaced with identical logging variant; note
that this is not as sophisticated as the more recent TAO toys with
covert RF channels and active, on-demand capabilities...
the keyboard tampering:
 which is for all intents and purposes otherwise visually undetectable
using this trojan chip technique, tailored for every common
while that was not bad, aside from leaking tamper event, the FDE was
so sad/funny. a screw amuck, replacement drive significantly different
(when compared to identical lot mate purchased with original that got
yanked for offline attack)
in a round about manner this was all instigated in part by wifi
research done at the time which put various powerful entities into a
tiff.  here's what the pacNW sample looked like back in early 2003:
"Cleartext Nodes: 8755 (62.59%)
  , WEP Nodes: 5232 (37.40%)"
 ... ah, memories :)
one last fun learning by example: consider that you thwart direct
physical access black bag type attempts, and are not running a
vulnerable router/CPE, and present a sufficiently compelling target,
you may encounter a clever "just outside the property line" isolation
and active attack on DOCSIS uplink. (a broadcast medium is hard to
mess with in a covert manner, unless you're able to isolate target
from the local broadcast loop itself.)

you're assuming this dump is exhaustive.  this is a very specifically
themed/focused release of top end tactics and exploits (essentially
weaponized platforms for targeted attacks). Jake says as much about
what they're dropping, which while impressive, has still gone through
the "best interest of public safety scrutinizing and censorship"
the indiscriminate, wholesale compromises are just getting started...
these disclosures will have more impact: financially to the impacted
vendors, effectively to IC as known vulnerable hardware and software
is replaced, and to the public at large now exposed to even more
essentially incomprehensible disclosures of vulnerability and
this is just an example of how, when the NSA pursues "all means and

are intentionally leveraged and discouraged from remediation for use
in tailored access (black bag / targeted) attacks.

@_subject: Replacing corporate search engines with anonymous/decentralized 
decentralized search (not just not-corporate search) persists as one
of the great
practical challenges in peer to peer networking.
i have more to say later, but one effort from back in early 2000 is alpine:
   inside the 2004 snapshot there is also docs and implementation of
feedbackfs which is used to gather implicit feedback on recommendation
alpine is explicitly highly connected, flatter than not network
topology to improve robustness in the face of failure and active
attacks, and to avoid limitations inherent in many connection oriented
operating system facilities/sockets.
i am not quite an impartial party ;)
 but other approaches which are not a feasible replacement include:
 - the old skewl (mostly)flooding broadcasts like gnutella
 - fragile, hard to defend constructs like DHTs as keyword indexes
 - aggressive caching with local search (110% useful, but not sufficient alone)
 - distributed (but better somehow) search engines on darknets, etc.
these are more about search privacy or deep search more than
decentralized search.
the longer discussion is how to make decentralized search useful.
"Google style" search has a terrific performance advantage over
decentralized designs by brute force.
however, take advantage of massive endpoint / peer processing and
resources combined with implicit observational metrics for reputation
and recommendation, inside a well integrated framework for resource
discovery in usable software, and you have something more robust and
more effective than "Google style" could ever provide.
this is quite the trick, however!  despite an inter-operable component
model interface, and dynamic runtime module support to extend
discovery and wire protocol extensions, and other intentional efforts
at encouraging adoption and integration, alpine failed to bootstrap.
(i did many things wrong, but those things i did at least make
conscious effort to do right.  did i mention this is a hard problem?
this project has been excavated from archives, and will receive
maintenance upgrades[0] at minimum and significant improvement a
possible option, depending.

compromise of hardware vendors goes back to CryptoAG and as recently
as the BULLRUN leaks.  a bit too long and complicated a thread for
this list, i think...
sure, just another example of in scope target for a "compromise all
the things" approach.
my point was to highlight their response as particularly deceptive and
inexcusable when observing how the various parties not only respond,
but act, in response to these leaks. (e.g. Google deploying crypto
over their internal fibers is positive action.  sitting silent or
deflecting criticism not confidence inspiring...)

this, in the traditional sense, is what John calls a "COMSEC cover-up":
 meaning that the continual, most significant, and most likely to be
abused and widely are commercial services and collaborations and
  where the product is your private information of any sort, that you
usually unwittingly but sometimes capriciously yield to un trustworthy
third parties with little constraint on secondary distribution for
money to further removed stranger parties...
note that fully decentralized, end-to-end secured, with properly
managed keying and sessions capable technologies are resistant to
these third-party weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
crypto and comms and computing technology should not be abandoned en
whole like the russians for their manual type writers, but the minimum
required operational safety of any information processing system needs
huge innovation to get from current systems to something effective and
usable...  hey look, it's more of those fun problems to solve again ;)

regarding the inability for NSA employees to report ethical violations
in a manner that did not assure retribution:
this is actually a somewhat difficult anonymity / privacy question in
the context of highly compartmented information and operations, where
knowledge of a subset of specific details is sufficient to imply
strong suspicion and scrutiny to a very small number of individuals...
... assuming you don't circumvent the apparently mediocre constraints
to this information in the information systems that contain it. ;)
while academically interesting, in all practical terms we should
render this question moot and provide absolute communication
origin[0], destination[1], and content[2] privacy to all network users
in all locations under all circumstances guaranteed by constitutional
law, prosecutorial discretion, and practical realities (read:
implementations resistant to Tailored Access Operations like efforts
(NSA TAO / CNE related programs)
this latter guarantee will require a bit more design, coding and deployment,
 fun problems to solve![3]
1.  "peer communication endpoint privacy" - this is a hard problem.
the existing implementations are not usable and insufficiently large
in anonymity set (too few users): zero knowledge high latency mail
like messaging mixes, even if the twitter mixes are pretty cool.
a proper solution would be datagram based, NAT busting, low latency
(read: sufficiently real-time for video and voice), the majority
protocol across the Internet and local intranets and ad-hoc mesh nets
and other networks,
in an implementation that resists all known general purpose (wide
scale) and specialized (highly targeted and/or weaponized bleeding
edge and/or privileged positioned) attacks.
2. strong encryption like: alligator wrapped forward secrecy intended
streams, and equivalent techniques, solve this problem.
  clearly there is much work to do in the implementation and protocol
side of crypto integrity.  very, very much work...
3. "NSA TAO / CNE related programs" resistance is a very tall bar.
they rolled this out at DEF CON, of course. the soon departing .gov
Alexander rolled into town with some world class shit, no doubt...  is
it really going to be 33 years before we can talk about it?  for
better or for worse we won't have Snowden to disclose this

Snowden Says He Took No Secret Files to Russia
By JAMES RISEN
WASHINGTON - Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency
contractor, said in an extensive interview this month that he did not
take any secret N.S.A. documents with him to Russia when he fled there
in June, assuring that Russian intelligence officials could not get
access to them.
Mr. Snowden said he gave all of the classified documents he had
obtained to journalists he met in Hong Kong, before flying to Moscow,
and did not keep any copies for himself. He did not take the files to
Russia because it wouldn't serve the public interest," he said.
"What would be the unique value of personally carrying another copy of
the materials onward?" he added.
He also asserted that he was able to protect the documents from
China's spies because he was familiar with that nation's intelligence
abilities, saying that as an N.S.A. contractor he had targeted Chinese
operations and had taught a course on Chinese
"There's a zero percent chance the Russians or Chinese have received
any documents," he said.
American intelligence officials have expressed grave concern that the
files might have fallen into the hands of foreign intelligence
services, but Mr. Snowden said he believed that the N.S.A. knew he had
not cooperated with the Russians or the Chinese. He said he was
publicly revealing that he no longer had any agency documents to
explain why he was confident that Russia had not gained access to
them. He had been reluctant to disclose that information previously,
he said, for fear of exposing the journalists to greater scrutiny.
In a wide-ranging interview over several days in the last week, Mr.
Snowden offered detailed responses to accusations that have been
leveled against him by American officials and other critics, provided
new insights into why he became disillusioned with the N.S.A. and
decided to disclose the documents, and talked about the international
debate over surveillance that resulted from the revelations. The
interview took place through encrypted online communications.
Mr. Snowden, 30, has been praised by privacy advocates and assailed by
government officials as a traitor who has caused irreparable harm, and
he is facing charges under the Espionage Act for leaking the N.S.A.
documents to the news media. In the interview, he said he believed he
was a whistle-blower who was acting in the nation's best interests by
revealing information about the N.S.A.s surveillance dragnet and huge
collections of communications data, including that of Americans.
He argued that he had helped American national security by prompting a
badly needed public debate about the scope of the intelligence effort.
The secret continuance of these programs represents a far greater
danger than their disclosure," he said. He added that he had been more
concerned that Americans had not been told about the N.S.A.s reach
than he was about any specific surveillance operation.
So long as there's broad support amongst a people, it can be argued
there's a level of legitimacy even to the most invasive and morally
wrong program, as it was an informed and willing decision," he said.
However, programs that are implemented in secret, out of public
oversight, lack that legitimacy, and that's a problem. It also
represents a dangerous normalization of governing in the dark, where
decisions with enormous public impact occur without any public input.
Mr. Snowden said he had never considered defecting while in Hong Kong,
nor in Russia, where he has been permitted to stay for one year. He
said he felt confident that he had kept the documents secure from
Chinese spies, and that the N.S.A. knew he had done so. His last
target while working as an agency contractor was China, he said,
adding that he had had access to every target, every active
operation mounted by the N.S.A. against the Chinese. Full lists of
them, he said.
If that was compromised, he went on, N.S.A. would have set the
table on fire from slamming it so many times in denouncing the damage
it had caused. Yet N.S.A. has not offered a single example of damage
from the leaks. They havent said boo about it except we think,
maybe, have to assume from anonymous and former officials. Not
China is going dark. Not the Chinese military has shut us out.
An N.S.A. spokeswoman did not respond Thursday to a request for
comment on Mr. Snowden's assertions.
Mr. Snowden said his decision to leak N.S.A. documents developed
gradually, dating back at least to his time working as a technician in
the Geneva station of the C.I.A. His experiences there, Mr. Snowden
said, fed his doubts about the intelligence community, while also
convincing him that working through the chain of command would only
lead to retribution.
He disputed an account in The New York Times last week reporting that
a derogatory comment placed in his personnel evaluation while he was
in Geneva was a result of suspicions that he was trying to break in to
classified files to which he was not authorized to have access. (The
C.I.A. later took issue with the description of why he had been
reprimanded.) Mr. Snowden said the comment was placed in his file by a
senior manager seeking to punish him for trying to warn the C.I.A.
about a computer vulnerability.
Mr. Snowden said that in 2008 and 2009, he was working in Geneva as a
telecommunications information systems officer, handling everything
from information technology and computer networks to maintenance of
the heating and air-conditioning systems. He began pushing for a
promotion, but got into what he termed a petty e-mail spat in which
he questioned a senior manager's judgment.
Several months later, Mr. Snowden said, he was writing his annual
self-evaluation when he discovered flaws in the software of the
C.I.A.s personnel Web applications that would make them vulnerable to
hacking. He warned his supervisor, he said, but his boss advised him
to drop the matter and not rock the boat. After a technical team also
brushed him off, he said, his boss finally agreed to allow him to test
the system to prove that it was flawed.
He did so by adding some code and text in a nonmalicious manner=94 to
his evaluation document that showed that the vulnerability existed, he
said. His immediate supervisor signed off on it and sent it through
the system, but a more senior manager the man Mr. Snowden had
challenged earlier was furious and filed a critical comment in Mr.
Snowden's personnel file, he said.
He said he had considered filing a complaint with the C.I.A.=92s
inspector general about what he considered to be a reprisal, adding
that he could not recall whether he had done so or a supervisor had
talked him out of it. A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment on Mr.
Snowden's account of the episode or whether he had filed a complaint.
But the incident, Mr. Snowden said, convinced him that trying to work
through the system would only lead to punishment. He said he knew of
others who suffered reprisals for what they had exposed, including
Thomas A. Drake, who was prosecuted for disclosing N.S.A. contracting
abuses to The Baltimore Sun. (He met with Mr. Snowden in Moscow last
week to present an award to him for his actions.) And he knew other
N.S.A. employees who had gotten into trouble for embarrassing a senior
official in an e-mail chain that included a line, referring to the
Chinese Army, that said, Is this the P.L.A. or the N.S.A.?
Mr. Snowden added that inside the spy agency theres a lot of dissent
 palpable with some, even. But he said that people were kept in line
through fear and a false image of patriotism, which he described as
obedience to authority.
He said he believed that if he tried to question the N.S.A.s
surveillance operations as an insider, his efforts would have been
buried forever, and he would have been discredited and ruined.=94 He
said that the system does not work, adding that you have to report
wrongdoing to those most responsible for it.
Mr. Snowden said he finally decided to act when he discovered a copy
of a classified 2009 inspector generals report on the N.S.A.s
warrantless wiretapping program during the Bush administration. He
said he found the document through a dirty word search, which he
described as an effort by a systems administrator to check a computer
system for things that should not be there in order to delete them and
sanitize the system.
"It was too highly classified to be where it was," he said of the
report. He opened the document to make certain that it did not belong
there, and after he saw what it revealed, curiosity prevailed, he
After reading about the program, which skirted the existing
surveillance laws, he concluded that it had been illegal, he said. =93If
the highest officials in government can break the law without fearing
punishment or even any repercussions at all, he said, secret powers
become tremendously dangerous.
He would not say exactly when he read the report, or discuss the
timing of his subsequent actions to collect N.S.A. documents in order
to leak them. But he said that reading the report helped crystallize
his decision. You cant read something like that and not realize what
it means for all of these systems we have," he said.
Mr. Snowden said that the impact of his decision to disclose
information about the N.S.A. had been bigger than he had anticipated.
He added that he did not control what the journalists who had the
documents wrote about. He said that he handed over the documents to
them because he wanted his own bias divorced from the decision-making
of publication, and that technical solutions were in place to ensure
the work of the journalists couldn't be interfered with."
Mr. Snowden declined to provide details about his living conditions in
Moscow, except to say that he was not under Russian government control
and was free to move around.

in addition to legal protections, educational support, and competitive programs,
also provide:
- direct and unrestricted backbone access to various individuals or
groups who demonstrate competence in either the educational or
competitive realms, in order for them to mount additional attack
strategies against any reach-able target.  this access must consist of
both passive taps of backbone traffic as well as injection taps for
raw packet transmission at core rates. this should be available on the
Internet backbone at internet exchanges, private fiber through public
right of way, and core networks of operators of licensed wireless
a side benefit of implementing these reforms would be the de-facto
de-funding of offensive network operations by third parties or

of course; the complete details will be slow to arrive, not least
because detailed description requires a demonstration in a
reproduction test setup, rather than reporting of actual traffic. :/
that said, useful aspects i'll certainly provide on whim or request.
the defining characteristics of the two types of attacks:
DC19 with DRT:
- "high power on-site", less descriminant attacks. target by and
limited to location.
- MitM for system, application, and protocol level attacks. Evilgrade,
MasterKey vulns, etc.  mostly known and a few 0day escalated attacks.
- favorite attack: "Google Voice Search" always-on eavesdropper
payload; Speex voice from all audible participants.
DC20 with Alexander's toys:
- "in the towers", highly targeted to specific devices, active over
wide metro area.
- baseband exploit vector for device key retrieval, memory and storage
forensics, exfiltration.
- PDoS attacks (bricked secondary devices used as fall back once
identified by call graph; ~20 hours)
- favorite attack: baseband pwn in airplane mode, with ex-filtration
over custom channel.
DC21: no appearance (observed).  speculation ongoing...
reversing attacker capabilities, toolkits, TTPs, humanpower/hours, a
much longer tangent.  but this assertion is based on correlation of
the observed power, capacity, and protocols in specific bands
implemented by the attacker with the capabilities of the DRT system.
multiple locations, terabytes of captured spectrum, patience and
as for who was operating it - unknown beyond the usual suspects, which
is a small set due to the restricted distribution of both the hardware
platform and the exploit kit atop it :)
i'll send more details once available.  the details and distribution
to be part of a separate FOIPA effort for US citizen security

thought provoking read, as always. thanks Dan :)
this is worth posting whole, particularly this observation:
... polarization has come to cyber
security.  High end practice is accelerating away from the low end.
The best skills are now astonishingly good while the great mass of
those dependent on cyber security are ever less able to even estimate
what it is that they do not know, much less act on it.  This
polarization is driven by the fundamental strategic asymmetry of
cyber security, namely that while the workfactor for the offender
is the incremental price of finding a new method of attack, the
workfactor for the defender is the cumulative cost of forever
defending against all attack methods yet discovered.  Over time,
the curve for the cost of finding a new attack and the curve for
the cost of defending against all attacks to date must cross.  Once
those curves cross, the offender never has to worry about being out
of the money.  That crossing event occurred some time ago.
i do have one comment, per:
Everyone my age working in cyber security was trained for something
else, and because of that switch between one field and another
brings along the hybrid vigor of seeing the cyber security world
through a different lens.
instead of having a "cyber security" profession, all aspects of
"information security", "software security", or "cyber security" as a
specialization should not exist.  competence and experience with these
subjects should be considered part of routine software and systems
development practice. (right now this is mostly impractical, however,
it need not always be so...)

.Trends in Cyber Security
.Dan Geer, 6 November 13, NRO
Thank you for the invitation to speak with you today, which, let
me be clear, is me speaking as myself and not for anybody or anything
else.  As you know, I work the cyber security trade, that is to say
that my occupation is cyber security.  Note that I said "occupation"
rather than "profession."  On 18 September, the U.S. National Academy
of Sciences, on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security,
concluded that cyber security should be seen as an occupation and
not a profession because the rate of change is too great to consider
professionalization.[1]  You may well agree that that rate of change
is paramount and thus why cyber security is the most intellectually
demanding occupation on the planet.  In writing this essay, I will
keep my comments to trends rather than point estimates, just as you
asked in your invitation, but let me emphasize the wisdom of your
request by noting that the faster the rate of change, the more it
is trends that matter and not the value of any given variable at
any given time.  With luck, each of these trends will not be something
that you would argue with as a trend.  Argument, if any, will be
in their interpretation.
Note also that these trends do not constitute a set of mutually
exclusive, collectively exhaustive characterizations of the space
in which we live and work.  Some of them are correlated with others.
Some of them are newly emergent, some not.  Some of them are
reversible to a degree; some not reversible at all.  I am not, today
anyway, looking for causality.
Trend  Polarization
Much has been written about the increasing polarization of American
life.[2]  The middle is getting smaller whether we are noting that
only the middle class is shrinking, that it is the middle of the
country that is depopulating, that the political middle is lonelier
and lonelier, that both farms and banks are now only too small to
matter or too big to fail, that almost all journalism is now advocacy
journalism, that middle tier college education is a ticket to debt
and nothing else.
I submit that this trend towards polarization has come to cyber
security.  High end practice is accelerating away from the low end.
The best skills are now astonishingly good while the great mass of
those dependent on cyber security are ever less able to even estimate
what it is that they do not know, much less act on it.  This
polarization is driven by the fundamental strategic asymmetry of
cyber security, namely that while the workfactor for the offender
is the incremental price of finding a new method of attack, the
workfactor for the defender is the cumulative cost of forever
defending against all attack methods yet discovered.  Over time,
the curve for the cost of finding a new attack and the curve for
the cost of defending against all attacks to date must cross.  Once
those curves cross, the offender never has to worry about being out
of the money.  That crossing event occurred some time ago.
I'll come back to this first bullet at the end, but I mention it
first as polarization is becoming structural and of all the trends
the most telling.  You can confirm this by asking the best cyber
security people what they do on the Internet and what they won't
do on the Internet.  You will find it sharply different than what
the public at large does or will do.  The best people know the most,
and they are withdrawing, they are rejecting technologies.  To use
the words and style of the Intelligence Community, they are
Trend  Trends themselves
The idea that under the pressure of constant change about all you
can measure is the slope of the curve has gone from
don't-bother-me-with-math to everybody's-doing-it.  A Google search
for the phrase "information security trends" turns up 13,400 hits
and no two of the top ten are from the same source.  Consultancies
talk about what they are seeing in the back room, product vendors
talk about evolving needs, and reporters talk about what they are
seeing out on the street.
I am one of those folks.  A Wall Street colleague and I run the
Index of Cyber Security.[3]  The ICS is what is called a sentiment-based
index; if you are familiar with the US Consumer Confidence Index,[4]
then you already know what a sentiment-based index is.  Respondents
to the ICS are top drawer cyber security practitioners with direct
operational responsibility who share, each month, how their view
of security in several areas has changed since the month before.
Because there are no absolutes in cyber security, not even widely
agreed upon definitions of the core terms that make up cyber security
practice, a sentiment-based Index is, in fact, the best decision
support that can be done.
The Index asks the respondents monthly whether each of two dozen
different risks has gotten better, gotten worse, gotten a lot better,
gotten a lot worse, or stayed the same since the month before.  Out
of this, the Index of Cyber Security is calculated and released at
6pm on the last calendar day of the month, in further similarity
to the Consumer Confidence Index.  We write an analytic annual
report that I have given to the organizers for your further reading.
As an index of risk, a higher ICS number means higher risk.  That
risk number has risen, and seems likely to continue to rise.  It
is a composite trend line, but what is more interesting is that the
components of the risk are much more varied, i.e., what is the
dominating risk one month may not be the next.  We think that this
captures, in part, the dynamic nature of cyber security and does
so in a way not otherwise being done.  Respondents seem to agree
that the ICS does offer decision support to front-line people such
as themselves.
Trend  then, is that there is increasingly wide acceptance that
absolute measures are not worth seeking and a kind of confirmation
that cyber security is a practice, not a device.
Trend  Physics and its impact on data
As you well know, more and more data is collected and more and more
of that data is in play.  The general, round-numbers dynamic of
this trend are these: Moore's Law continues to give us two orders
of magnitude in compute power per dollar per decade while storage
grows at three orders of magnitude and bandwidth at four.  These
are top-down economic drivers and they relentlessly warp what is
the economically optimum computing model.  The trend is clear; the
future is increasingly dense with stored data but, paradoxically,
despite the massive growth of data volume, that data becomes more
mobile with time.
As is obvious, this bears on cyber security as data is what cyber
security is all about.  In 2007, Jim Gray gave a seminal talk[5]
about the transformation of science, coining the term "fourth
paradigm."  By that he meant that the history of science is that
science began as an endeavor organized around empirical observation.
After that came the age of theory -- theorizing as the paradigm of
what science did.  Then science became computational, again meaning
that the paradigm of what science did was to calculate.  His argument
for a fourth era was that of a paradigm shift from computational
science to data intensive science.  You here at NRO need no primer
on the power of that shift in paradigm, but I am here to tell you
that cyber security is embracing that fourth paradigm and it is
doing it now.
Ecology professor Philip Greear would challenge his graduate students
to catalog all the life in a cubic yard of forest floor.  Computer
science professor Donald Knuth would challenge his graduate students
to catalog everything their computers had done in the last ten
seconds.  It is hard to say which is more difficult, but everywhere
you look, cyber security practitioners are trying to get a handle
on "What is normal?" so that that which is abnormal can be identified
early in the game.  Behavioral approaches leading towards intrusion
detection are exactly the search for anomaly, and they are data
based.  The now-famous attack on RSA Data Security that led to RSA
buying Net Witness is an example of wanting to know everything so
as to recognize something.  I'm on the record at book length [6]
that the central organizing principle behind a competent security
program is to instrument your data sufficiently well that nothing
moves without it being noticed.  Physics has made it possible to
put computers everywhere.  Physics has made it possible to fill
them all with data.
Cyber security is barely keeping up, and not just because of two,
three, or four orders of magnitude in the physics upstream of the
Trend  Need for prediction
We all know that knowledge is power.  We all know that there is a
subtle yet important distinction between information and knowledge.
We all know that a negative declaration like "X did not happen" can
be only proven if you have the enumeration of *everything* that did
happen and can show that X is not in it.  We all know that a stitch
in time saves nine, but only if we know where to put the stitch.
We all know that without security metrics, the outcome is either
overspending or under protecting.
The more technologic the society becomes, the greater the dynamic
range of possible failures.  When you live in a cave, starvation,
predators, disease, and lightning are about the full range of
failures that end life as you know it and you are well familiar
with all of them.  When you live in a technologic society where
everybody and everything is optimized in some way akin to just-in-time
delivery, the dynamic range of failures is incomprehensibly larger
and largely incomprehensible.  The wider the dynamic range of
failure, the more prevention is the watchword.  As technologic
society grows more interdependent within itself, the more it must
rely on prediction based on data collected in broad ways, not
targeted ways.
Some define risk as the probability of a failure times the cost of
that failure.  To be clear, a trend in favor of making predictions
is a trend subsidiary to a trend in the cost of failure.  I've
written at length elsewhere about how an increasing downside cost
of failure requires that we find ways to be resilient, but not
resilient in the sense of rich redundancy, not resilient in the
sense of having quick recovery mechanisms, but resilient in the
sense of having alternate primary means that do not share common
mode risks.  As such, I strongly recommend that manual means be
preserved wherever possible because whatever those manual means
are, they are already fully capitalized and they do not share common
mode risk with digital means.
There is now more information security risk sloshing around the
economy than could actually be accepted were it exposed.  The
tournament now turns to who can minimize their risk the best, which,
in the civilian economy at large, means who can most completely
externalize their downside information security costs.  The weapons
here are perhaps as simple as the wisdom of Delphi, "Know thyself"
and "Nothing to excess" -- know thyself in the sense of quantitative
rigor and a perpetual propensity to design information systems with
failure in mind; nothing to excess in the sense of mimicking the
biologic world's proof by demonstration that species diversity is
the greatest bulwark against loss of an ecosystem.
Trend  Abandonment
If I abandon a car on the street, then eventually someone will be
able to claim title.  If I abandon a bank account, then the State
will eventually seize it.  If I abandon real estate by failing to
remedy a trespass, then in the fullness of time adverse possession
takes over.  If I don't use my trademark, then my rights go over
to those who use what was and could have remained mine.  If I abandon
my spouse and/or children, then everyone is taxed to remedy my
actions.  If I abandon a patent application, then after a date
certain the teaching that it proposes passes over to the rest of
you.  If I abandon my hold on the confidentiality of data such as
by publishing it, then that data passes over to the commonweal not
to return.  If I abandon my storage locker, then it will be lost
to me and may end up on reality TV.  The list goes on.
Apple computers running 10.5 or less get no updates (comprising
about half the installed base).  Any Microsoft computer running XP
gets no updates (comprising about half the installed base).  The
end of security updates follows abandonment.  It is certainly ironic
that freshly pirated copies of Windows get security updates when
older versions bought legitimately do not.
Stating the obvious, if Company X abandons a code base, then that
code base should be open sourced.  Irrespective of security issues,
many is the time that a bit of software I use has gone missing
because its maker went missing.  But with respect to security, some
constellation of {I,we,they,you} are willing and able to provide
security patches or workarounds as time and evil require.
Would the public interest not be served, then, by a conversion to
open source for abandoned code bases?  But wait, you say, isn't
purchased software on a general purpose computer a thing of the
past?  Isn't the future auto-updated smartphone clients transacting
over armored private (carrier) networks to auto-updated cloud
services?  Maybe; maybe not.  If the two major desktop suppliers
update only half of today's desktops, then what percentage will
they update tomorrow?
If you say "Make them try harder!," then the legalistic, regulatory
position is your position, and the ACLU is already trying that
route.  If smartphone auto-update becomes a condition of merchantability
and your smartphone holds the keying material that undeniably says
that its user is you, then how long before a FISA court orders a
special auto-update to *your* phone for evidence gathering?
If you say "But we already know what they're going to do, don't
we?," then the question is what about the abandoned code bases.
Open-sourcing abandoned code bases is the worst option, except for
all the others.  But if seizing an abandoned code base is too big
a stretch for you before breakfast, then start with a Public Key
Infrastructure Certifying Authority that goes bankrupt and ask "Who
gets the keys?"
Trend  Interdependence
The essential character of a free society is this: That which is
not forbidden is permitted.  The essential character of an unfree
society is the inverse, that which is not permitted is forbidden.
The U.S. began as a free society without question; the weight of
regulation, whether open or implicit, can only push it toward being
unfree.  Under the pressure to defend against offenders with a
permanent structural advantage, defenders who opt for forbidding
anything that is not expressly permitted are cultivating a computing
environment that does not embody the freedom with which we are
heretofore familiar.
Put concretely, the central expression of a free society is a free
market, and the cardinal measure of a free market is the breadth
of real choice -- choice that goes beyond color and trim and body
style to choices that optimize discordant, antithetical goal states.
The level of choice on the Internet is draining down.  You may revel
in the hundreds of thousands of supposedly new voices that have
found a way to chatter in full view.  You may note that new "apps"
for Android plus iPhone are appearing at over a thousand per day.
You may rightly remind us all that technology is democratizing in
the sense that powers once reserved for the few are now irretrievably
in the hands of the many.  What stands against that, and why I say
that it stands against that, is increasing interdependence.
We humans can design systems more complex than we can then operate.
The financial sector's "flash crashes" are an example of that;
perhaps the fifty interlocked insurance exchanges for Obamacare
will soon be another.  Above some threshold of system complexity,
it is no longer possible to test, it is only possible to react to
emergent behavior.  The lowliest Internet user is entirely in the
game of interdependence -- one web page can easily touch scores of
different domains.  While writing this, the top level page from
cnn.com had 400 out-references to 85 unique domains each of which
is likely to be similarly constructed and all of which move data
one way or another.  If you leave those pages up and they have an
auto-refresh, then moving to a new network signals to every one of
those ad networks that you have so moved.
The wellspring of risk is dependence, especially dependence on
shared expectations of shared system state, i.e., interdependence
on the ground.  If you would accept that you are most at risk from
the things you most depend upon, then damping dependence is the
cheapest, most straightforward, lowest latency way to damp risk,
just as the fastest and most reliable way to put more money on a
business's bottom line is through cost control.
Trend  Automation
Shoshana Zuboff of the Harvard Business School notably described
three laws of the digital age,
. Everything that can be automated will be automated.
. Everything that can be informated will be informated.
. Every digital application that can be used for surveillance and
.    control will be used for surveillance and control.
It is irrelevant, immaterial and incompetent to argue otherwise.
For security technology, Zuboff's Laws are almost the goal state,
that is to say that the attempt to automate information assurance
is in full swing everywhere, the ability to extract information
from the observable is in full swing everywhere, and every digital
application is being instrumented.
Before In-Q-Tel, I worked for a data protection company.  Our product
was, and I believe still is, the most thorough on the market.  By
"thorough" I mean the dictionary definition, "careful about doing
something in an accurate and exact way."  To this end, installing
our product instrumented every system call on the target machine.
Data did not and could not move in any sense of the word "move"
without detection.  Every data operation was caught and monitored.
It was total surveillance data protection.  What made this product
stick out was that very thoroughness, but here is the point: Unless
you fully instrument your data handling, it is not possible for you
to say what did not happen.  With total surveillance, and total
surveillance alone, it is possible to treat the absence of evidence
as the evidence of absence.  Only when you know everything that
*did* happen with your data can you say what did *not* happen with
your data.
But this trend of automating is now leaving the purely defensive
position behind.  In a press release two weeks ago today,[7] DARPA
signaled exactly that, and I quote
   [T]he Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency intends to hold
   the Cyber Grand Challenge -- the first-ever tournament for fully
   automatic network defense systems.  DARPA envisions teams creating
   automated systems that would compete against each other to
   evaluate software, test for vulnerabilities, generate security
   patches and apply them to protected computers on a network.  The
   growth trends ... in cyber attacks and malware point to a future
   where automation must be developed...
The automation trend is irreversible, but it begs a question that
I fear no one will answer in a way that doesn't merely reflect their
corporate or institutional interest, namely are people in the loop
a failsafe or a liability?[8]
Trend  Dual use
I've become convinced that all security technology is dual use.
While I am not sure whether dual use is a trend or a realization
of an unchanging fact of nature, the obviousness of dual use seems
greatest in the latest technologies, so I am calling it a trend in
the sense that the straightforward accessibility of dual use
characteristics of new technology is a growing trend.
There are a lot of examples, but in the physical world any weapon
usable for defense can be repurposed for offense.  Every security
researcher looking for exploitable flaws is deep in the dual use
debate because once discovered, those flaws can be patched or they
can be sold.  The cyber security products that promise total
surveillance over the enterprise are, to my mind, an offensive
strategy used for defensive purposes.
There was a time when flaws were predominantly found by adventurers
and braggarts.  Ten plus years of good work by the operating system
vendors elbowed the flaw finders out of the operating system and,
as a result, our principal opponents changed over from adventurers
and braggarts to being professionals.  Finding vulnerabilities and
exploiting them is now hard enough that it has moved out of the
realm of being a hobby and into the realm of being a job.  This
changed several things, notably that braggarts share their findings
because they are paid in bragging rights.  By contrast, professionals
do not share and are paid in something more substantial than fame.
The side effect has been a continued rise in the percentage of all
vulnerabilities that are previously unknown.  The trend, in other
words, is that by crushing hobbyists we've raised the market price
of working exploits to where now our opponents pay for research and
development out of revenue.
Simulating what the opponent can do thus remains the central task
of defensive research.  Much of that research is in crafting proofs
of concept that such and such a flaw can be taken advantage of.
Corman's neologism of "HD Moore's Law" says that the trend in the
power of the casual attacker grows as does the trend of the power
in Metasploit.[9] It is hard to think of a better description of
dual use.
Trend  The blurring of end-to-end
To my mind, the most important technical decision ever made was
that the security of the Internet was to be "end-to-end."[10]
"End-to-end" is a generic technical term yet simple to explain: the
Internet was built on the premise that two entities could connect
themselves to each other and decide what they wanted to do.  The
network was a delivery vehicle, but the form, content, and security
of the connection between the two ends was to be their own choice.
End-to-end is a model where the terminal entities are smart and the
network is dumb.  This is completely (completely) different than a
smart network with dumb terminal entities at the end of the wire.
No other design decision of the Internet comes close to the importance
of it's being an end-to-end design.  With end-to-end, security is
the choice of the terminal end-points, not something built into the
fabric of the Internet itself.  That is American values personified.
It is the idea that accountability, not permission seeking, is the
way a government curbs the misuse of freedoms, and, as accountability
scales but permission seeking does not, accountability wins.
End-to-end security is the digital manifestation of the right of
association and, in any case, is what enabled the Internet to become
relevant in the first place.  End-to-end does precisely what Peter
Drucker told us to do: "Don't solve problems, create opportunities."
The provision of content from anywhere to anywhere, which is the
very purpose of an internetwork, is a challenge to sovereignty.
America's Founders wanted no sovereign at all, and they devised a
government that made the center all but powerless and the periphery
fully able to thumb its nose at whatever it felt like.  Much ink
has been spilled on the frontier ethic versus the wishful policies
favored by the comfortable urbanity of the welfare state, but the
Internet's protocols have everything in common with the former and
nothing in common with the latter.
The free man requires the choice of with what degree of vigor to
defend himself.  That is a universal; America's Founders laid that
down in the Second Amendment, just as did George Orwell in the
English democratic socialist weekly "Tribune" when he said, "That
rifle on the wall of the laborer's cottage or working class flat
is the symbol of democracy.  It is our job to see that it stays
there."  Were George Washington or George Orwell still among us,
they would know that smart end-points and dumb networks are what
freedom requires, that smart networks protecting dumb end-points
breed compliant dependency.
But the trend is otherwise, and not just because of the fatuous
fashionability of entitlement, but rather because of a blurring of
what the term "end" means.  So very many people have adopted automatic
synchronization of multiple devices they own that one has to ask
whether their tablet is an end or their collection of mutually
synchronized devices is an end.  So many Internet-dependent functions
are spread silently across numerous entities and applications that
what is the end may well be more dynamic than can be described.  If
an end implies unitary control on the part of an owner, then set
theory says that mutually synchronized devices are a unitary end.
That blurring of "end" makes end-to-end provisioning problematic
as a set of devices cannot be assumed to be equally on and equally
participating in any given transaction.  Quoting Clark & Blumenthal[11]
   There is a risk that the range of new requirements now emerging
   could have the consequence of compromising the Internet's original
   design principles.  Were this to happen, the Internet might lose
   some of its key features, in particular its ability to support
   new and unanticipated applications.  We link this possible outcome
   to a number of trends: the rise of new stakeholders in the
   Internet,...  new government interests, the changing motivations
   of the growing user base, and the tension between the demand for
   trustworthy overall operation and the inability to trust the
   behavior of individual users.
This is nowhere so evident as in security, that is to say in the
application of the end-to-end principle to cyber security.  What
does end-to-end secure transport mean when travelocity.com is showing
you a page dynamically constructed from a dozen other entities?
Trend  Complexity in the supply chain
Even without resorting to classified information, it is now clear
that supply chain attacks have occurred.  Whether reading journalistic
accounts or Richard Clarke's novel _Breakpoint_, the finding is
that the supply chain creates opportunities for badness.  None of
the things I've yet read, however, blames the supply chain risk on
its complexity, per se, but that is the trend that matters.
Security is non-composable -- we can get insecure results even when
our systems are assembled from secure components.  The more components,
the less likely a secure result.  This applies to supply chains
that are growing ever more complex under the pressure of just-in-time,
spot market sourcing of, say, memory chips and so forth and so on.
Because the attacker has only to find one component of that chain
to be vulnerable while the defender has to assure that all components
are invulnerable, rising supply chain complexity guarantees increased
opportunity for effective attack.  It cannot do otherwise, and the
trend is clear.
Trend  Monoculture(s)
Beginning with Forrest in 1997,[12] regular attention has been paid
to the questions of monoculture in the network environment.  There
is no point belaboring the fundamental question, but let me state
it for the record: cascade failure is so very much easier to detonate
in a monoculture -- so very much easier when the attacker has only
to write one bit of malware, not ten million.  The idea is obvious;
believing in it is easy; acting on its implications is, evidently,
rather hard.
I am entirely sympathetic to the actual reason we continue to deploy
computing monocultures -- making everything almost entirely alike
is, and remains, our only hope for being able to centrally manage
it in a consistent manner.  Put differently, when you deploy a
computing monoculture you are making a fundamental risk management
decision: That the downside risk of a black swan event is more
tolerable than the downside risk of perpetual inconsistency.  This
is a hard question, as all risk management is about changing the
future, not explaining the past.  Which would you rather have, the
unlikely event of a severe impact, or the day-to-day burden of
perpetual inconsistency?
When we opt for monocultures we had better opt for tight central
control.  This supposes that we are willing to face the risks that
come with tight central control, of course, including the maximum
risk of all auto-update schemes, namely the hostile takeover of the
auto-update mechanism itself.  Computer desktops are not the point;
embedded systems are.  The trendline in the number of critical
monocultures seems to be rising and many of these are embedded
systems both without a remote management interface and long lived.
That combination -- long lived and not reachable -- is the trend
that must be reversed.  Whether to insist that embedded devices
self destruct at some age or that remote management of them be a
condition of deployment is the question.  In either case, the
Internet of Things and the appearance of microcontrollers in seemingly
every computing device should raise hackles on every neck.[13]
Trend  Attack surface growth versus skill growth
Everyone here knows the terminology "attack surface" and knows that
one of the defender's highest goals is to minimize the attack surface
wherever possible.  Every coder adhering to a security-cognizant
software lifecycle program does this.  Every company or research
group engaged in static analysis of binaries does this.  Every
agency enforcing a need-to-know regime for data access does this.
Every individual who reserves one low-limit credit card for their
Internet purchases does this.  I might otherwise say that any person
who encrypts their e-mail to their closest counterparties does this,
but because consistent e-mail encryption is so rare, encrypting
one's e-mail marks it for collection and indefinite retention by
those entities in a position to do so, regardless of what country
you live in.
In cyber security practice, the trend is that we practitioners as
a class are getting better and better.  We have better tools, we
have better understood practices, and we have more colleagues.
That's the plus side.  But I'm interested in the ratio of skill to
challenge, and as far as I can estimate, we are expanding the
society-wide attack surface faster than we are expanding our
collection of tools, practices, and colleagues.  If you are growing
more food, that's great.  If your population is growing faster than
your improvements in food production can keep up, that's bad.
In the days of radio, there was Sarnoff's Law, namely that the value
of a broadcast network was proportional to N, the number of listeners.
Then came packetized network communications and Metcalfe's Law,
that the value of a network was proportional to N squared, the
number of possible two-way conversations.  We are now in the era
of Reed's Law where the value of a network is proportional to the
number of groups that can form in it, that is to say 2 to the power
N.  Reed's Law is the new reality because it fits the age of social
networks.  In each of these three laws as publicly stated, the sign
bit is positive, but in parallel with the claim that everything is
dual use, the sign bit can also be negative because interconnections
are a contributor to the net attack surface.  If an Internet of
Things is indeed imminent, then the upward bend in the curve of the
global attack surface will grow steeper regardless of what level
of risk there is for any one thing so long as that level of risk
is always non-zero.
Trend  Specialization
Everyone my age working in cyber security was trained for something
else, and because of that switch between one field and another
brings along the hybrid vigor of seeing the cyber security world
through a different lens.  Statisticians, civil engineers, and
lawyers alike can contribute.  But the increasing quality of prepatory
education, the increasing breadth of affairs for which cyber security
is needful, and the increasing demand for skill of the highest sort
means the humans in the game are specializing.
While some people like to say "Specialization is for insects," tell
me that the security field itself is not specializing.  We have
people who are expert in forensics on specific operating system
localizations, expert in setting up intrusion response, expert in
analyzing large sets of firewall rules using non-trivial set theory,
expert in designing egress filters for universities that have no
ingress filters, expert in steganographically watermarking binaries,
and so forth.  Generalists are becoming rare, and they are being
replaced by specialists.  This is biologic speciation in action,
and the narrowing of ecologic niches.  In rough numbers, there are
somewhere close to 5,000 various technical certifications you can
get in the computer field, and the number of them is growing thus
proving the conjecture of specialization and speciation is not just
for insects and it will not stop.

NSA tracking cellphone locations worldwide, Snowden documents show
By Barton Gellman and Ashkan Soltani, Wednesday, December 4, 12:18 PM
The National Security Agency is gathering nearly 5 billion records a
day on the whereabouts of cellphones around the world, according to
top-secret documents and interviews with U.S. intelligence officials,
enabling the agency to track the movements of individuals — and map
their relationships — in ways that would have been previously
The records feed a vast database that stores information about the
locations of at least hundreds of millions of devices, according to
the officials and the documents, which were provided by former NSA
contractorEdward Snowden. New projects created to analyze that data
have provided the intelligence community with what amounts to a mass
surveillance tool.
(Video: How the NSA uses cellphone tracking to find and ‘develop’ targets)
The NSA does not target Americans’ location data by design, but the
agency acquires a substantial amount of information on the whereabouts
of domestic cellphones “incidentally,” a legal term that connotes a
foreseeable but not deliberate result.
One senior collection manager, speaking on condition of anonymity but
with permission from the NSA, said “we are getting vast volumes” of
location data from around the world by tapping into the cables that
connect mobile networks globally and that serve U.S. cellphones as
well as foreign ones. Additionally, data is often collected from the
tens of millions of Americans who travel abroad with their cellphones
every year.
In scale, scope and potential impact on privacy, the efforts to
collect and analyze location data may be unsurpassed among the NSA
surveillance programsthat have been disclosed since June. Analysts can
find cellphones anywhere in the world, retrace their movements and
expose hidden relationships among individuals using them.
(Graphic: How the NSA is tracking people right now)
U.S. officials said the programs that collect and analyze location
data are lawful and intended strictly to develop intelligence about
foreign targets.
Robert Litt, general counsel for the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence, which oversees the NSA, said “there is no
element of the intelligence community that under any authority is
intentionally collecting bulk cellphone location information about
cellphones in the United States.”
The NSA has no reason to suspect that the movements of the
overwhelming majority of cellphone users would be relevant to national
security. Rather, it collects locations in bulk because its most
powerful analytic tools — known collectively as CO-TRAVELER — allow it
to look for unknown associates of known intelligence targets by
tracking people whose movements intersect.
Still, location data, especially when aggregated over time, is widely
regarded among privacy advocates as uniquely sensitive. Sophisticated
mathematical techniques enable NSA analysts to map cellphone owners’
relationships by correlating their patterns of movement over time with
thousands or millions of other phone users who cross their paths.
Cellphones broadcast their locations even when they are not being used
to place a call or send a text.
(Video: Reporter Ashkan Soltani explains NSA collection of cellphone data)
CO-TRAVELER and related tools require the methodical collection and
storage of location data on what amounts to a planetary scale. The
government is tracking people from afar into confidential business
meetings or personal visits to medical facilities, hotel rooms,
private homes and other traditionally protected spaces.
“One of the key components of location data, and why it’s so
sensitive, is that the laws of physics don’t let you keep it private,”
said Chris Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil
Liberties Union. People who value their privacy can encrypt their
e-mails and disguise their online identities, but “the only way to
hide your location is to disconnect from our modern communication
system and live in a cave.”
The NSA cannot know in advance which tiny fraction of 1 percent of the
records it may need, so it collects and keeps as many as it can — 27
terabytes, by one account, or more than double the text content of the
Library of Congress’s print collection.
The location programs have brought in such volumes of information,
according to a May 2012 internal NSA briefing, that they are
“outpacing our ability to ingest, process and store” data. In the
ensuing year and a half, the NSA has been transitioning to a
processing system that provided it with greater capacity.
The possibility that the intelligence community has been collecting
location data, particularly of Americans, has long concerned privacy
advocates and some lawmakers. Three Democratic senators — Ron Wyden
(Ore.), Mark Udall (Colo.) and Barbara Mikulski (Md.) — have
introduced an amendment to the 2014 defense spending bill that would
require U.S. intelligence agencies to say whether they have ever
collected or made plans to collect location data for “a large number
of United States persons with no known connection to suspicious
NSA Director Keith Alexander disclosed in Senate testimony in October
that the NSA had run a pilot project in 2010 and 2011 to collect
“samples” of U.S. cellphone location data. The data collected were
never available for intelligence analysis purposes, and the project
was discontinued because it had no “operational value,” he said.
Alexander allowed that a broader collection of such data “may be
something that is a future requirement for the country, but it is not
right now.”
The number of Americans whose locations are tracked as part of the
NSA’s collection of data overseas is impossible to determine from the
Snowden documents alone, and senior intelligence officials declined to
offer an estimate.
“It’s awkward for us to try to provide any specific numbers,” one
intelligence official said in a telephone interview. An NSA
spokeswoman who took part in the call cut in to say the agency has no
way to calculate such a figure.
An intelligence lawyer, speaking with his agency’s permission, said
location data are obtained by methods “tuned to be looking outside the
United States,” a formulation he repeated three times. When U.S.
cellphone data are collected, he said, the data are not covered by the
Fourth Amendment, which protects Americans against unreasonable
searches and seizures.
According to top-secret briefing slides, the NSA pulls in location
data around the world from 10 major “sigads,” or signals intelligence
activity designators.
A sigad known as STORMBREW, for example, relies on two unnamed
corporate partners described only as ARTIFICE and WOLFPOINT. According
to an NSA site inventory, the companies administer the NSA’s “physical
systems,” or interception equipment, and “NSA asks nicely for
STORMBREW collects data from 27 telephone links known as OPC/DPC
pairs, which refer to originating and destination points and which
typically transfer traffic from one provider’s internal network to
another’s. That data include cell tower identifiers, which can be used
to locate a phone’s location.
The agency’s access to carriers’ networks appears to be vast.
“Many shared databases, such as those used for roaming, are available
in their complete form to any carrier who requires access to any part
of it,” said Matt Blaze, an associate professor of computer and
information science at the University of Pennsylvania. “This ‘flat’
trust model means that a surprisingly large number of entities have
access to data about customers that they never actually do business
with, and an intelligence agency — hostile or friendly — can get ‘one
stop shopping’ to an expansive range of subscriber data just by
compromising a few carriers.”
Some documents in the Snowden archive suggest that acquisition of U.S.
location data is routine enough to be cited as an example in training
materials. In an October 2012 white paper on analytic techniques, for
example, the NSA’s counterterrorism analysis unit cites two U.S.-based
carriers to illustrate the challenge of correlating the travels of
phone users on different mobile networks. Asked about that, a U.S.
intelligence official said the example was poorly chosen and did not
represent the program’s foreign focus.
The NSA’s capabilities to track location are staggering, based on the
Snowden documents, and indicate that the agency is able to render most
efforts at communications security effectively futile.
Like encryption and anonymity tools online, which are used by
dissidents, journalists and terrorists alike, security-minded behavior
— using disposable cellphones and switching them on only long enough
to make brief calls — marks a user for special scrutiny. CO-TRAVELER
takes note, for example, when a new telephone connects to a cell tower
soon after another nearby device is used for the last time.
Side-by-side security efforts — when nearby devices power off and on
together over time — “assist in determining whether co-travelers are
associated … through behaviorally relevant relationships,” according
to the 24-page white paper, which was developed by the NSA in
partnership with the National Geospatial Agency, the Australian
Signals Directorate and private contractors.
A central feature of each of these tools is that they do not rely on
knowing a particular target in advance, or even suspecting one. They
operate on the full universe of data in the NSA’s FASCIA repository,
which stores trillions of metadata records, of which a large but
unknown fraction include locations.
The most basic analytic tools map the date, time, and location of
cellphones to look for patterns or significant moments of overlap.
Other tools compute speed and trajectory for large numbers of mobile
devices, overlaying the electronic data on transportation maps to
compute the likely travel time and determine which devices might have
To solve the problem of undetectable surveillance against CIA officers
stationed overseas, one contractor designed an analytic model that
would carefully record the case officer’s path and look for other
mobile devices in steady proximity.
“Results have not been validated by operational analysts,” the report said.

NSA morale down after Edward Snowden revelations, former U.S. officials say
By Ellen Nakashima, Published: December 7
Morale has taken a hit at the National Security Agency in the wake of
controversy over the agency’s surveillance activities, according to
former officials who say they are dismayed that President Obama has
not visited the agency to show his support.
A White House spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden, noted that top White House
officials have been to the agency to “express the president’s support
and appreciation for all that NSA does to keep us safe.”
It is not clear whether or when Obama might travel the 23 miles up the
Baltimore-Washington Parkway to visit Fort Meade, the NSA’s
headquarters in Maryland, but agency employees are privately voicing
frustration at what they perceive as White House ambivalence amid the
pounding the agency has taken from critics.
An NSA spokeswoman had no comment.
Obama in June defended the NSA’s surveillance as lawful and said he
welcomed the public debate prompted by revelations from former
contractor Edward Snowden beginning that month.
Though Obama has asserted, for instance, that the NSA’s collection of
virtually all Americans’ phone records is lawful and has saved lives,
the administration has not endorsed legislation that would codify it.
And his recent statements suggest he thinks some of the NSA’s
activities should be constrained.
A senior administration official who was not authorized to speak on
the record said that the White House would normally not endorse
legislation so early in the process but that “it’s been clear . . .
that we prefer legislation” that preserves the phone records program
“while making some changes . . . to potentially strengthen oversight
and transparency.”
Said Hayden: “The president has the highest respect for and pride in
the men and women of the intelligence community who work tirelessly to
protect our nation. He’s expressed that directly to NSA’s leadership
and has praised their work in public. As he said: ‘The men and women
of our intelligence community work every single day to keep us safe
because they love this country and believe in our values. They’re
patriots.’ ”
She noted that in recent weeks, Lisa Monaco, assistant to the
president for homeland security and counterterrorism, and Denis
McDonough, the White House chief of staff, visited Fort Meade “to
express the president’s support and appreciation for all that NSA does
to keep us safe.”’
Supporters of the NSA say staffers are not feeling the love.
“The agency, from top to bottom, leadership to rank and file, feels
that it is had no support from the White House even though it’s been
carrying out publicly approved intelligence missions,” said Joel
Brenner, NSA inspector general from 2002 to 2006. “They feel they’ve
been hung out to dry, and they’re right.”
A former U.S. official — who like several other former officials
interviewed for this story requested anonymity because he still has
dealings with the agency — said: “The president has multiple
constituencies — I get it. But he must agree that the signals
intelligence NSA is providing is one of the most important sources of
intelligence today.
“So if that’s the case, why isn’t the president taking care of one of
the most important elements of the national security apparatus?”
The White House, observers say, is caught between competing desires to
preserve what it has said are valuable national security programs and
to shield the president from criticism from allies abroad and
civil-liberties advocates at home.
Some observers said it is not surprising that Obama would not travel
to Fort Meade before internal and external reviews of surveillance
activities have been completed. The reviews are expected to be done
The NSA’s director, Gen. Keith Alexander, who is retiring in the
spring after 81 / 2 years, has been the most vocal defender of the
agency’s 35,000 employees. In speeches he has noted that more than
6,000 of them went to Iraq and Afghanistan to support the military. He
has spoken of how 22 cryptologists were killed. “They’re the heroes —
not the media leaker,” he said in a September speech, in a reference
to Snowden.
NSA counterterrorism analysts have worked “every weekend for eight
years since I’ve been here. . . . Twenty-four hours a day, seven days
a week, they’re there to defend us,” he said then.
On Thursday, Obama said on MSNBC that he would be proposing “some
self-restraint on the NSA” and “some reforms that can give people more
In an interview with NBC last month, he said: “In some ways, the
technology and the budgets and the capacity [at NSA] have outstripped
the constraints. And we’ve got to rebuild those in the same way that
we’re having to do on a whole series of capacities . . . [such as]
drone operations.”
Civil-liberties advocates generally agree with that sentiment, but
they would go further and say that the NSA’s bulk collection of
domestic phone records is unlawful and ought to be ended.
Former officials note how President George W. Bush paid a visit to the
NSA in January 2006, in the wake of revelations by the New York Times
that the agency engaged in a counterterrorism program of warrantless
surveillance on U.S. soil beginning after the Sept. 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks. “Bush came out and spoke to the workforce, and the
effect on morale was tremendous,” Brenner said. “There’s been nothing
like that from this White House.”
A second former official said NSA workers are polishing up their
résumés and asking that they be cleared — removing any material linked
to classified programs — so they can be sent out to potential
employers. He noted that one employee who processes the résumés said,
“I’ve never seen so many résumés that people want to have cleared in
my life.”
Morale is “bad overall,” a third former official said. “The news — the
Snowden disclosures — it questions the integrity of the NSA
workforce,” he said. “It’s become very public and very personal.
Literally, neighbors are asking people, ‘Why are you spying on
Grandma?’ And we aren’t. People are feeling bad, beaten down.”

to be specific: it is this certification step that fully open source
SDR/baseband equipment manufacturers have difficultly with.  E.g. the
FCC plainly states systems  "wholly dependent on open source elements”
would have a “high burden” to demonstrate their security during the
certification process.  where many have taken "high burden" to mean
"nearly impossible"...

you ask interesting questions Dan, and draw useful conclusions :)
some items to note:
- is this DUAL_EC_DRNG? don't think so. deadline is FY 2013.
- is this DUAL_EC_DRNG? the market for closed source, proprietary
crypto solutions is small (and growing smaller, :(
- is this XSTORE? it's been a while. but never should have been used
directly. see mtrngd with MSR bits set no whitening, max sample, max

some cryptographers and cypherpunks have become despondent or dejected
or demoralized by these events.

@_subject: Fwd: [zs-p2p] [Cryptography] Fwd: [IP] 'We cannot trust' Intel and 
I think there may be weaknesses in Intel's hardware RNG.  I took a
good look at Intel's hardware random number generator source. There's
a paper analyzing it here:
The basic idea is that back-to-back inverters, when powered on, flip
one way or the other randomly, sort of like DRAM memory when our
computer's power on.  By powering on a single pair of back-to-back
inverters over and over, they can generate a random bit per cycle, at
about 3 Giga-bits/second, which is amazing!  Here's my concerns about
the the paper:
- I saw no mathematical analysis of how much noise exists in the
system and how strongly it will influence the result each cycle. There
were generalities about how the noise could cause the output to be
random, but no numbers at all.
- There is an assumption that the capacitors are charged/discharged by
10% of the standard deviation of the noise.  I saw no justification
for this.  It seems they simply assumed best case.
- The paper is about as objective as a mother talking about her
children.  For example: "Overall, the Ivy Bridge RNG is a robust
design with a large margin of safety that ensures good random data is
generated even if the ES is not operating as well as predicted." Based
on what?
- I am not convinced they have the right model for the entropy source.
 They add noise to the bias on the capacitors, and compare that to 0
to determine the next output bit in their model.  I think the main
source of noise may be the randomness in number of electrons
added/subtracted each cycle, and that the back-to-back inverters in
the absence of other noise may be acting almost as an ideal
comparator.  However, if this were the case, even if there were 10%
noise in the number of electrons, there would be considerable
correlation between bits.
I also have questions about the design itself.  My main concern is
that noise on the VDD rail could easily determine the output.  For
example, if the transistors are mismatched, which of course they will
be, and the bias is set exactly right on the caps so there's a 50-50
chance of a 0 or 1, and suddenly VDD drops 10% due to a rising edge of
the the main system clock, then the inverter with higher gate
thresholds will become weak faster than the other one, thus
determining which one wins.  Since this circuit runs asynchronously
from the main system clock, I could easily see the 3MHz system clock
phase relative to the entropy generator clock determining most of the
results from the entropy source, while looking fairly random. Any
weakness in the raw random data stream is hidden from us by the AES
encryption done as a post-process.
I simulated back-to-back inverters in my .35u low power CMOS process
in SPICE to see if I could figure out how to make a practical circuit
using Intel's topology.  If it works, it would be fantastic.  I think
I can get rid of most of the supply noise issues.  I had a similar
problem in my "Infinite Noise Multiplier", so I switched to powering
the circuit with nothing but large W and L constant current sources,
and using the range from 0V to Vref, rather than 0V to VDD, because
Vref is stable relative to AVSS. However, I wasn't able to get enough
noise to make Intel's ciruit work, though that may be due to
limitations in the SPICE simulator.
Has anyone else had success using Intel's RNG topology?

@_subject: Fwd: [zs-p2p] [Cryptography] Fwd: [IP] 'We cannot trust' Intel and 
I have to take back my criticism of Intel's RNG.  I got my sims
working for a version of their architecture in .35u CMOS, and it's
simply better than my "Infinite Noise Multiplier".  It's probably the
best true random noise generator ever.  I still don't like how their
schematic is seems highly sensitive to supply noise, but we don't know
what the actual circuit looks like.  Intel hasn't told us.
So, I'm going to modify it a bit to use the resistors available on my
chip and reduce the caps, fix the supply sensitivity, and I think I
can run 16 of these things in parallel at 100-200MHz on the tiny .35u
CMOS chip I'm designing.  I'll spit out the raw waveforms from the
inverters, buffered once, through 16 "analog" pins, so there wont be
any fear (hopefully) that I'm cooking the data on-chip, before you can
see it, and I'll open-source the schematics.  If there's a circuit
that can consume all 1.6Gbit/sec of this raw data, have fun with it!
On the digital side, I'll XOR bits together to get the bandwidth down
to something reasonable, which I can send over USB, and provide a
simple Linux driver.
This thing will definitely put out RF, but since I'm making the raw
data available at the pins, should I care?  By the way, this is just a
for-fun project at work.  I get to do a free chip design :-)

the partnership with NGA to deploy them gives a hint: this is putting
USRPs up close and personal to target for exploitation.
(the USRP's are definitely more portable than my favorite SDR, the Noctar[0]!)
given the obtained bits mentioned (WLLids, DSL accounts, Cookies,
GooglePREFIDs) gathered and then handed off to TAO for further QUANTUM
INSERT fucking of target systems it is likely they are doing GSM/cell
MitM to observe identifiers, along with WiFi attacks, and other egress
rather than deploying baseband exploits or deep active attacks
directly against the devices or other networks they're communicating
thus CNE in this case is cell MitM/WiFi pwn with a USRP rogue tower to
get identifiers for TAO.  and TAO is where they get dirty with "remote
exploitation" of the device itself and other targets on networks it
we've seen how they have a smorgasbord of weaponized exploits to cover
the gamut of target hardware and technical acumen in the QUANTUM

efforts.  it appears they're using this same infrastructure where

see also this section on the OPEC hacks:
Here’s how the NSA and GCHQ go after an organization like OPEC step by
step, based on an analysis of the NSA and GCHQ documents exposed by
Step 1: Identify. Using the NSA-built packet capture and inspection
system called TURMOIL, the agencies filter through Internet traffic at
a network choke point looking for specific "fingerprints" in traffic
that identify users with the organization being targeted. Data from
TURMOIL gets pulled into a number of traffic analysis tools, such as
XKeyscore and TRAFFICTHIEF, which do different sorts of packet
XKeyscore is the NSA's distributed search engine, catching a large
chunk of international Internet traffic for analysis. It helps find
things deep in the clutter of the Internet that analysts might miss by
allowing them to use search terms to find things in both live and
cached Internet traffic.
TRAFFICTHIEF, on the other hand, is much more focused. It filters for
very "strong" indicators, like known sets of IP addresses, addresses
within e-mail traffic, or user names in logins to social networks or
other services. It provides less depth of analysis than XKeyscore, but
it can handle much larger loads of data because it is more selective
about what it processes.
Together, the tools can be used to identify the systems used by an
individual or organization, including ranges of addresses that they
may use from work or home.
Step 2: Target. Using the profiles built using the surveillance tools,
the agencies can then identify potential points of attack. XKeyscore,
for example, can be used to search for patterns that identify known
security vulnerabilities within a range of addresses. Web visit
histories, e-mail traffic, and other data are analyzed looking for the
most likely (and least detectable) approach to gain access, and a
specific attack plan is crafted, including the identification of where
to launch the attack from.
At the NSA, this sort of thing is the work of Tailored Access
Operations. In the case of OPEC, the targeting process apparently went
on for several years as the NSA sought openings for an attack.
Step 3: Attack. Depending on who the target is, the NSA and GCHQ have
a variety of options. The least costly is to use access provided by
one of the intelligence agencies' telecommunications "partners" who
own network equipment at an exchange or other choke point that the
target's Internet traffic passes through. The agency running the
attack can use that access to introduce changes to Internet routing
tables that detour the targeted individual's traffic. But in some
cases, the NSA and GCHQ may have to perform "unilateral" taps on
network backbones to gain that level of access—targeting a piece of
network hardware to take over or splicing directly into the target's
own connection to the Internet.
It's not clear which attack the NSA used to gain access to OPEC's
systems, though the GCHQ used a Quantum attack two years later to gain
its own very special access to the cartel's network. In the case of
the Belgacom hack, the GCHQ used a Quantum insert attack—routing the
Web requests for LinkedIn and Slashdot from the engineer being
targeted to a server posing as those sites. The NSA has used the same
approach to intercept traffic to sites such as Google.
The man-in-the-middle server can present content from the actual sites
the target intended to visit, but it can also add content to the
traffic, using what's called packet injection—modifying the contents
of the data as it passes through—and intercept the user's credentials.
And by using a forged certificate, the NSA can intercept encrypted
traffic intended for the destination site.
Once the user has connected to the fake server, the intelligence
agencies can use the connection to launch attacks against the target's
Web browser to install monitoring software or other malware, using
similar techniques to those used by hackers. They can also use
credentials exposed via the man-in-the-middle attack to gain access to
other accounts owned by the target and to troll through connections in
those services that might be potential targets.
Step 4: Exploit. Once the target's computer has been successfully
attacked, the effort begins to look much like that of the Chinese
cyber warriors' attack of the New York Times or what cyber criminals
typically do when they score access to high-value targets. The
agencies' hackers work to stealthily expand their level of access,
using customized remote administration tools to grab user privileges
and gain access to other network resources—mail servers, file servers,
and other network systems. They then start to "exfiltrate" data from
these systems and deliver them to analysts.

"used in Virtual Private Network" == PPTP,IPsec,OpenVPN,etc.
"Web encryption devices" == in my interpretation, this is any targeted
hardware with the vulnerable chip.  it could be a tablet, a desktop,
and rack mount server...  any of these platforms could speak VPN or
Web crypto.  TAO/SCS do like to get into the switches though ;)
mostly "cloud infrastructure", "software defined data center", and the like:
back in the day, Sun got tired of the (relatively) slow performance
and latency of crypto offloading via bus and simply threw it into the
core.  you were still offloading crypto, but within the CPU.
also note that endpoint compromises sufficient to decrypt VPN or
secure web traffic is already present in TAO/CNE's tasking.  this
effort [CCP_00009] may focus on VPN concentrator / secure web proxy
deployments specifically to handle the RDRAND lookup per their private
starting counter.
previous back doors have also used entropy leakage sufficient to bring
a brute force attack into reasonable effort, while still denying third
parties a class break of the entropy / keys used.  this type of key
space search is not done on the ground with portable CNE but instead
back at SCS...
on a related tangent, the lack of additional disclosures is quite
frustrating.  this entire conversation would be resolved in a glance
if $the_snowden_gatekeepers were acting in the public interest.  :/

only with "foreknowledge of the modification" are you able to utilize
this backdoor. (NSA does not like to share)

Ok, given those requirements. Who fits the bill?
High end platform:
Intel targets what it believes is a significant growth opportunity to
bring the Intel Architecture into a rapidly evolving networking space.
Intel added to its portfolio with the introduction of the Highland
Forest platform, which combines the vendor’s Xeon E5-2600 v2 CPU with
its new Coleto Creek chipset. Price said Highland Forest – which can
pack up to 20 2.4GHz “Ivy Bridge” CPU cores – will offer two to six
times the performance of the previous Crystal Forest platform, which
was launched in October 2012.
Highland Forest, with Intel’s Data Plane Development Kit, can deliver
up to 255 million packets per second (p/s) – more than the 140 million
p/s from Crystal Forest – as well as security capabilities of 110
Gigabits per second of IPsec and 200 Gb/s SSL security for encrypted
IPsec (VPN) and SSL (Web crypto) and lots of it!  sounds interesting.
tell me more!
other market points of note:
- "Intel currently has over 15 SDN/NFV qualification trials underway
with carriers in all major regions.  Schooler emphasized that Intel
has no intention to sell directly to service providers and is fully
committed to launching an Intel Network Builders Ecosystem of industry
players supporting the Intel Architecture."
- "6WIND Announces Availability of Support for Intel® Xeon® Processor

funny they seem to distance themselves from "Highland Forest" and "Ivy

they sound interesting, like they sell to many industries at large
scale.  are they a popular company/product?
 ""“6WINDGate is already deployed in tens of commercial LTE networks

hey Wind River, how are you using RDRAND?
now what about Intel themselves, are they also pushing the chip?
Intel officials are making aggressive moves to expand the reach of its
silicon beyond servers and into other parts of the data centre.
Schooler said the company has been making products for networking gear
for about a decade, and has made significant strides in recent years.
It’s also made several acquisitions – such as of Sensory Networks,
Ethernet chip maker Fulcrum Microsystems and networking software maker
Aepona, whose technology enables telecoms and cloud service providers
to offer more services on their networks.
Intel is looking to take advantage of the growth opportunity
networking represents, Schooler said. The market Intel is targeting is
about $16 billion (£9.7bn), and the chip maker currently has about 5
percent of it. Along with its x86 architecture, Intel also is
developing accelerator chips for such jobs as packet inspection and
whew.  that's a lot of context and circumstance.  let's look back over
your goals for 2013:

i will admit that i am continually impressed by NSA/SCS achievements.

my reading between the lines: it is not a special chip, it is a
special collection of many of them (20+) handling tier-1 core traffic
encryption, which is an excellent point to aggregate a vulnerability
in keying ciphers. (ignore public key for now, since we can just focus

this does bring up an interesting point:
while it may be more efficient to use the same "key" for the DRBG
output across all processor lines, it would be more secure to use a
different key per line.  this implies that each iteration of Sandy
Bridge -> Ivy Bridge -> Haswell needs to be "enabled" by CCP, with
Xeon E5 debut in 2013 as discussed.
for Sandy Bridge, this would have shown in 2010? and unless in network
equipment described simply as "enabling decryption for Sandy Bridge
used by $operating systems and $applications."
sadly we'll have to wait a while to confirm this conjecture for
Haswell.  and we'll have to wait forever for more leaks apparently, as

Certivox Asked That We Share Their Side of the Story on the PrivateSky Takedown.
The real story on the PrivateSky takedown.
Posted by Brian Spector on Thu, Dec 12, 2013
With the story about our PrivateSky takedown now public, I want to
take the opportunity to clarify a few points in various articles that
have appeared since yesterday covering the story.
Some headlines strongly infer our friends at GCHQ "forced" us to take
PrivateSky down. That's not the case.
Secondly, a very important point wasn't printed. GCHQ couldn't, by
law, request a blanket back door on the system. There are a very rigid
set of controls that mean only specific individuals can come under
surveillance. The legal request for such surveillance has a due
process that must be stridently followed. At no time did I or anyone
at CertiVox talk about CertiVox in relation to any RIPA warrant, only
the generic process by which these warrants are served.
By saying "our friends at GCHQ", there is no facetiousness intended.
The team at CertiVox have the upmost respect for the folks we
interacted with at GCHQ. They took the due process I outlined in the
previous point very seriously. We found that as an organisation, and
every individual involved there, were as worried about a breach of
public trust as much as we are.
Finally, I believe very strongly the following should be a larger part
of the public discourse of these subjects. What everyone needs to
understand is that every developed democracy in the world, even where
privacy rights are enshrined to the maximum efficacy by statute, has
laws on the books that mandate that Internet Service Providers have
facilities to work with law enforcement for the purposes of legal
intercept, to enforce public safety and security.
Being L.I. capable is a very important set features and functions that
must be in place for any credible, commercial service on the Internet.
In endeavouring to make PrivateSky as secure as possible, we
overlooked this critical requirement when we built PrivateSky.
When CertiVox positioned PrivateSky as the easiest to use and most
secure encrypted messaging service, we really had two significant
points of differentiation. First, even though we held the root
encryption keys to the system, it was architected in such as way that
it would have been all but impossible for our internal staff to snoop
on our customer's communications, or for the service to leak any of
our customer¹s data. Secondly, our possession of the root keys, and
our use of identity based encryption, made the system incredibly easy
to use. For the user, there were no private or public keys to manage,
every workflow was handled for the user in an easy to grasp pure HTML5
interface, no hardware or software required, just an HTML5 browser.
We boxed ourselves into a feature set and market position that when
called upon to comply with legal statues, we simply had no alternative
but to shut the service down. We built it, but we couldn't host it.
Why? Because as you can probably surmise, there is an inherent
impedance mismatch between being able to host a commercial
communications service that gives the upmost in privacy to its users,
against any breach, whilst at the same time being able to operate
safely within the confines of the law as it is on the books in most
countries on the planet.
In summary, it's the abuse of the communications interception in the
Snowden revelations that has everyone up in arms, as so it should. But
that¹s not what happened with PrivateSky.

ah FSB; you crack me up!
'''A senior officer of Russian counter-intelligence said: "Although

I am pretty sure that kidnaping the former NSA employee will be

Edward Snowden can be kidnapped from Russia?
10.12.2013 14:57
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of NSA's total control systems can
be kidnapped from Russia. This is a priority for the British MI-6 and
the British Embassy, former NSA agent Wayne Madsen said, referring to
his colleagues.
Of course, nothing is known whether the CIA received the task, and
whether the U.S. Embassy is going to be involved in the activities to
try to kidnap Snowden. However, the British Embassy has already
tracked calls and letters of Snowden's "inner circle" and begun to
"dig up" their contacts in Moscow.
According to The Guardian, Snowden has the information, the disclosure
of which could become a nightmare for the U.S., even though the
fugitive NSA specialist decided not to disclose some of his data. In
addition, The Guardianadmitted that the media have so far published
"only 1%" of available information about NSA's total control over
billions of people in different countries.
Nevertheless, even this one percent has already made the UK
authorities introduce outright censorship against those who reveal
secrets of "global surveillance."
In particular, Wayne Madsen said that his girlfriend, who previously
worked for the National Security Agency as an expert on the Russian
language, tried to contact Snowden's acquaintances. Afterwards, she
was invited to come to the British Embassy and undergo special
training. She was also asked to report of FSB's interest in her
persons and communications.
The press quoted a former NSA expert, who said that the job to find
Snowden was of the highest priority for the embassy. Moreover, it was
said that the future operation to kidnap him involved number one MI-6
officer at the embassy, who worked under diplomatic cover as the
director for regional security.
The Center for the Study of Globalization has previously reported that
should the operation be successful, Snowden would be delivered to the
UK or the U.S. For the time being, the flywheel of total wiretapping
that Snowden launched was working against him to the utmost. "MI-6
intelligence agencies have begun to analyze the information they were
able to obtain through intelligence," the statement from the center
A senior officer of Russian counter-intelligence, whom Politonline.ru
confidentially managed to talk to, said: "Although the Federal
Security Bureau does not do anything about human rights activist
Snowden, the service has been active in counterintelligence. I am
pretty sure that kidnaping the former NSA employee will be
dramatically challenging." He also thanked "former NSA employees and
journalists for publishing such information, but added that
operational, technical and other measures to counter intelligence and
other illegal activities of foreign secret services on the territory
of Russia were  constantly maintained.
It only remains to add that the CIA has recently created a special
section in Russian on its official website, in which the department
offered Russian citizens (!) to join American intelligence. To choose
from, for example, the CIA offers engineering and technical
directions, a linguistic job, a secret agent with the knowledge of
Russian language and experts in business and analysts. The CIA
reportedly hopes to obtain classified information from newcomers in
the above areas to establish a new database of agents.

as per the FreeBSD announcement[0] and others[1][2] direct use of
RDRAND as sole entropy source is not recommended.
from Westmere onward you could use AES-NI to make crypto fast in
OpenSSL.  a common theme is to initialize OpenSSL via
ENGINE_load_builtin_engines() which lets OpenSSL take advantage of
this acceleration.
with Sandy Bridge you also got RDRAND. now load_builtin_engines
results in the application using RDRAND directly for all entropy, in
addition to accelerating AES.
if you are using an application linked with openssl-1.0.1-beta1
through openssl-1.0.1e you should do one of the following:
a.) rebuild your OpenSSL with OPENSSL_NO_RDRAND defined.
b.) call RAND_set_rand_engine(NULL) after ENGINE_load_builtin_engines().
c.) git pull latest openssl with commit: "Don't use rdrand engine as
default unless explicitly requested." - Dr. Stephen Henson
the OPENSSL_NO_RDRAND option is recommended; an inadvertent call to
load engines elsewhere could re-enable this bad rng behavior.

- broad region detect text rows into individual row images
- region detect individual chars per row image then assign char value via OCR
- insert human in loop to confirm / correct OCR row by row

- iterate over known text with candidate fonts until best match.
- iterate over candidate words in best font until best match.

it's legit.
on a more serious note, regarding the assumption:
 "if everything is backdoored already, essentially key escrow exists"
NSA has stated that many of their BULLRUN techniques are incredibly
fragile.  a number of them now burned in leaks, many yet to get
stuffed. if they "did it risky"[0], perhaps feeling emboldened by the
seeming success of Dual_EC_DRBG and friends, a common key / reduction
hidden behind AES-128 rounds could be discovered, independently
confirmed, and properly attributed.
so not only can the backdoors be broken up, replacements which are
resistant to compromise will take their stead.  "everything" becomes
"much" becomes "very little" until ideally such invasive tactics are
reserved for HUMINT tasked "good ol'e detective work" with legal
bonafides judged according to public laws and applicable to all
persons on earth, not just tribal deference pointed inward.
the jury is out; there are encouraging signs... but first, back to

your understanding is flawed.  let me clarify:
the NSA does not currently break Tor on demand at the protocol level.
all indications are this is currently true.
the NSA and others have great success around Tor by opportunistically
watching users fuck up (see other usability thread), by pwning their
horribly insecure systems (0days as far as the eye can see..), and by
actively manipulating user paths to the Tor network or destination
"forget your global passive adversary threats, active denial and
manipulation of service attacks are _really_ scary!"
said another way, breaking Tor at protocol level is currently too
expensive a solution to the same ends provided by much cheaper means.

Towards Efficient Traffic-analysis Resistant Anonymity Networks
Stevens LeBlond, David Choffnes, Wenxuan Zhou, Peter Druschel, Hitesh
Ballani, and Paul Francis
August 2013
Existing IP anonymity systems tend to sacrifice one of low latency,
high bandwidth, or resistance to traffic-analysis. High-latency
mix-nets like Mixminion batch messages to resist traffic-analysis at
the expense of low latency. Onion routing schemes like Tor deliver low
latency and high bandwidth, but are not designed to withstand traffic
analysis. Designs based on DC-nets or broadcast channels resist
traffic analysis and provide low latency, but are limited to low
bandwidth communication.
In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation
of Aqua, a high bandwidth anonymity system that resists traffic
analysis. We focus on providing strong anonymity for BitTorrent, and
evaluate the performance of Aqua using traces from hundreds of
thousands of actual Bit-Torrent users. We show that Aqua achieves
latency low enough for efficient bulk TCP flows, bandwidth sufficient
to carry BitTorrent traffic with reasonable efficiency, and resistance
to traffic analysis within anonymity sets of hundreds of clients. We
conclude that Aqua represents an interesting new point in the space of
anonymity network designs.

We were somewhere in San Francisco on the edge of the 56th IETF when
the drugs began to take hold.  I remember saying something like "I
feel a bit
lightheaded; maybe you should take notes...."  And suddenly there was a
terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge
OIDs, all swooping and screeching and diving around the RFC, which was about a
hundred pages long.  And a voice was screaming: "Holy Jesus!  Where are these
goddamn business cases?"
Then it was quiet again.  My attorney had taken his shirt off and was pouring
beer into his mouth, to facilitate the PKI standards-creation process.  "What

Wyden estimates that he gets about fifteen minutes a year to ask
questions of top intelligence officials at open hearings. With the
help of his intelligence staffer, John Dickas, a thirty-five-year-old
from Beaverton, Oregon, whom Wyden calls “the hero of the
intelligence-reform movement,” Wyden often spends weeks preparing his
questions. He and Dickas look for opportunities to interrogate
officials on the gaps between what they say in public and what they
say in classified briefings. At a technology conference in Nevada the
previous summer, General Keith Alexander, the director of the N.S.A.,
had said that “the story that we have millions or hundreds of millions
of dossiers on people is absolutely false.” Wyden told me recently,
“It sure didn’t sound like the world I heard about in private.” For
months, he tried to get a clarification from the N.S.A. about exactly
what Alexander had meant. Now he had the opportunity to ask Clapper in
public. As a courtesy, he had sent him the question the day before.
Wyden leaned forward and read Alexander’s comment. Then he asked,
“What I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to
the question ‘Does the N.S.A. collect any type of data at all on
millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?’ ”
Clapper slouched in his chair. He touched the fingertips of his right
hand to his forehead and made a fist with his left hand.
“No, sir,” he said. He gave a quick shake of his head and looked down
at the table.
“It does not?” Wyden asked, with exaggerated surprise.
“Not wittingly,” Clapper replied. He started scratching his forehead
and looked away from Wyden. “There are cases where they could
inadvertently perhaps collect, but not wittingly.”
Wyden told me, “The answer was obviously misleading, false.”

@_subject: acoustic side channel attacks against TEMPEST shielded equipment 
interesting work on using poor quality sound (like from a phone) for
chosen cipher text attacks with key recovery for GPG.
also note that they use frequencies >10kHz.  as discussed in the high
frequency audio covert channel, this range is fairly contention free
and easily accessible to microphones in consumer electronics of
various types.
Here, we describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis key extraction attack,
applicable to GnuPG's current implementation of RSA. The attack can
extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of
various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the
computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We
experimentally demonstrate that such attacks can be carried out, using
either a plain mobile phone placed next to the computer, or a more
sensitive microphone placed 4 meters away.
Beyond acoustics, we demonstrate that a similar low-bandwidth attack
can be performed by measuring the electric potential of a computer
chassis. A suitably-equipped attacker need merely touch the target
computer with his bare hand, or get the required leakage information
from the ground wires remote end of VGA, USB or Ethernet

Inside TAO
Documents Reveal Top NSA Hacking Unit
By SPIEGEL Staff
The NSA's TAO hacking unit is considered to be the intelligence
agency's top secret weapon. It maintains its own covert network,
infiltrates computers around the world and even intercepts shipping
deliveries to plant back doors in electronics ordered by those it is
In January 2010, numerous homeowners in San Antonio, Texas, stood
baffled in front of their closed garage doors. They wanted to drive to
work or head off to do their grocery shopping, but their garage door
openers had gone dead, leaving them stranded. No matter how many times
they pressed the buttons, the doors didn't budge. The problem
primarily affected residents in the western part of the city, around
Military Drive and the interstate highway known as Loop 410.
In the United States, a country of cars and commuters, the mysterious
garage door problem quickly became an issue for local politicians.
Ultimately, the municipal government solved the riddle. Fault for the
error lay with the United States' foreign intelligence service, the
National Security Agency, which has offices in San Antonio. Officials
at the agency were forced to admit that one of the NSA's radio
antennas was broadcasting at the same frequency as the garage door
openers. Embarrassed officials at the intelligence agency promised to
resolve the issue as quickly as possible, and soon the doors began
opening again.
It was thanks to the garage door opener episode that Texans learned
just how far the NSA's work had encroached upon their daily lives. For
quite some time now, the intelligence agency has maintained a branch
with around 2,000 employees at Lackland Air Force Base, also in San
Antonio. In 2005, the agency took over a former Sony computer chip
plant in the western part of the city. A brisk pace of construction
commenced inside this enormous compound. The acquisition of the former
chip factory at Sony Place was part of a massive expansion the agency
began after the events of Sept. 11, 2001.
On-Call Digital Plumbers
One of the two main buildings at the former plant has since housed a
sophisticated NSA unit, one that has benefited the most from this
expansion and has grown the fastest in recent years -- the Office of
Tailored Access Operations, or TAO. This is the NSA's top operative
unit -- something like a squad of plumbers that can be called in when
normal access to a target is blocked.
According to internal NSA documents viewed by SPIEGEL, these on-call
digital plumbers are involved in many sensitive operations conducted
by American intelligence agencies. TAO's area of operations ranges
from counterterrorism to cyber attacks to traditional espionage. The
documents reveal just how diversified the tools at TAO's disposal have
become -- and also how it exploits the technical weaknesses of the IT
industry, from Microsoft to Cisco and Huawei, to carry out its
discreet and efficient attacks.
The unit is "akin to the wunderkind of the US intelligence community,"
says Matthew Aid, a historian who specializes in the history of the
NSA. "Getting the ungettable" is the NSA's own description of its
duties. "It is not about the quantity produced but the quality of
intelligence that is important," one former TAO chief wrote,
describing her work in a document. The paper seen by SPIEGEL quotes
the former unit head stating that TAO has contributed "some of the
most significant intelligence our country has ever seen." The unit, it
goes on, has "access to our very hardest targets."
A Unit Born of the Internet
Defining the future of her unit at the time, she wrote that TAO "needs
to continue to grow and must lay the foundation for integrated
Computer Network Operations," and that it must "support Computer
Network Attacks as an integrated part of military operations." To
succeed in this, she wrote, TAO would have to acquire "pervasive,
persistent access on the global network." An internal description of
TAO's responsibilities makes clear that aggressive attacks are an
explicit part of the unit's tasks. In other words, the NSA's hackers
have been given a government mandate for their work. During the middle
part of the last decade, the special unit succeeded in gaining access
to 258 targets in 89 countries -- nearly everywhere in the world. In
2010, it conducted 279 operations worldwide.
Indeed, TAO specialists have directly accessed the protected networks
of democratically elected leaders of countries. They infiltrated
networks of European telecommunications companies and gained access to
and read mails sent over Blackberry's BES email servers, which until
then were believed to be securely encrypted. Achieving this last goal
required a "sustained TAO operation," one document states.
This TAO unit is born of the Internet -- created in 1997, a time when
not even 2 percent of the world's population had Internet access and
no one had yet thought of Facebook, YouTube or Twitter. From the time
the first TAO employees moved into offices at NSA headquarters in Fort
Meade, Maryland, the unit was housed in a separate wing, set apart
from the rest of the agency. Their task was clear from the beginning

that this is not as sophisticated as the more recent TAO toys with

the keyboard tampering:

while that was not bad, aside from leaking tamper event, the FDE was
so sad/funny. a screw amuck, replacement drive significantly different
(when compared to identical lot mate purchased with original that got
yanked for offline attack)
in a round about manner this was all instigated in part by wifi
research done at the time which put various powerful entities into a

"Cleartext Nodes: 8755 (62.59%)

one last fun learning by example: consider that you thwart direct
physical access black bag type attempts, and are not running a
vulnerable router/CPE, and present a sufficiently compelling target,
you may encounter a clever "just outside the property line" isolation
and active attack on DOCSIS uplink. (a broadcast medium is hard to
mess with in a covert manner, unless you're able to isolate target
from the local broadcast loop itself.)

these disclosures will have more impact: financially to the impacted

@_subject: Replacing corporate search engines with anonymous/decentralized 
decentralized search (not just not-corporate search) persists as one
of the great
practical challenges in peer to peer networking.
i have more to say later, but one effort from back in early 2000 is alpine:
   inside the 2004 snapshot there is also docs and implementation of
feedbackfs which is used to gather implicit feedback on recommendation
alpine is explicitly highly connected, flatter than not network
topology to improve robustness in the face of failure and active
attacks, and to avoid limitations inherent in many connection oriented
operating system facilities/sockets.
i am not quite an impartial party ;)
 but other approaches which are not a feasible replacement include:
 - the old skewl (mostly)flooding broadcasts like gnutella
 - fragile, hard to defend constructs like DHTs as keyword indexes
 - aggressive caching with local search (110% useful, but not sufficient alone)
 - distributed (but better somehow) search engines on darknets, etc.
these are more about search privacy or deep search more than
decentralized search.
the longer discussion is how to make decentralized search useful.
"Google style" search has a terrific performance advantage over
decentralized designs by brute force.
however, take advantage of massive endpoint / peer processing and
resources combined with implicit observational metrics for reputation
and recommendation, inside a well integrated framework for resource
discovery in usable software, and you have something more robust and
more effective than "Google style" could ever provide.
this is quite the trick, however!  despite an inter-operable component
model interface, and dynamic runtime module support to extend
discovery and wire protocol extensions, and other intentional efforts
at encouraging adoption and integration, alpine failed to bootstrap.
(i did many things wrong, but those things i did at least make
conscious effort to do right.  did i mention this is a hard problem?

maintenance upgrades[0] at minimum and significant improvement a

my point was to highlight their response as particularly deceptive and
inexcusable when observing how the various parties not only respond,
but act, in response to these leaks. (e.g. Google deploying crypto
over their internal fibers is positive action.  sitting silent or
deflecting criticism not confidence inspiring...)

@_subject: [qubes-devel] please look at Comparison of Whonix, Tails, 
Qubes is built with security in mind and a clear intent to minimize
attacks surface. this is akin to the proactive defense grsecurity and
a hardened distro provides against a generic distribution.
compare the opposite approach of VMWare or VirtualBox which focus on
features and low level accelerations (kernel driver for network,
graphics, USB, acceleration, other extensions) without thought to the
added risk these less then hardened components expose the host
operating systems and other guests to.
for example, but not limited to, networking passive and active attacks
on physical and virtual endpoints, local and host privilege
escalations, driver level privilege escalations, and many other
serious vulnerabilities Qubes prevents outright by design and explicit
all of these protections require zeroization to be performed before
physical access; an interesting HCI design detail itself...
  (at DEF CON there are the usual hack the software attack challenges,
and non computing seal and lock based physical attack challenges, but
i have not yet seen a hack the running system cold boot attack
challenge - perhaps because a real attack would likely be destructive
to some or most of the hardware to be tested.  i'd still be game for
mobile and workstation challenges if anyone else is interested :)
