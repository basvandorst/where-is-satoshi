@_subject: [tor-talk] anyone in SF want to talk on TOR at BAHA this Sunday, 
We're meeting Sunday at 2pm to give a talk on VPNs and Darknets, and
I'd like to cover TOR too but I could use an expert to assist :-)
Would anyone in the Bay Area like to show up to speak briefly on TOR,
or simply to answer questions?
If you've got a full preso on TOR, contact me, we can arrange
