@_subject: Green Paper on PICS from ALA 
Does anyone still have a copy of the Green Paper on PICS usage in a library
setting by Magpantay that was yanked from the ALA web site?
I would be interested in reading a copy of it.

@_subject: What are the flaws with FV payment system? 
I only received this an hour ago.  I would very much like to attend, but can't put my fingers on the detailed analysis of FV's flaws in their system, which I would like to bring up in person at this seminar.  Could someone please point me in the right direction?

I'm rather sorry too.  I found the information at  to be of interest and would have liked an answer to the privacy issue specifically and the other issues brought up by that document.
Unfortunately I had a work-related problem that kept me from leaving Monroe in time to make the trip up to East Lansing.
If you would answer that point on privacy, that was to be the main interest I had in attending the meeting.  Having read through the material offered at  I still feel the privacy issue and the ability to intercept email confirmations still haven't been addressed.  You discuss email interception in  but that document is from Nov, 1995 and doesn't address the concern adequately in my opinion.

Does this mean that Alta Vista and FTPsearch are going to be sued also?  FTPsearch is at  and has been used by thousands to find the latest "warez" depositories.
