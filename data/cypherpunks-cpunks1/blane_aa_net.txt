Just goes to show why congress should pass a mandatory spell-checker
bill. We need their protection from these misspelling miscreants, don't we?

@_subject: WWW User authentication 
I just finished writing a cgi script to allow users to change their login
passwords via a webpage. I currently have the webpage being authenticated
with the basic option (uuencoded plaintext). MD5 would be nicer, but how
many browsers actually support it?
  When the user changes their password, the form sends their name, old
password, and new password with it, in the clear. This is no worse than
changing your password across a telnet connection, but I'd like it to be
more secure, but useable by a large number of browsers.
  Any advice?

It could be implemented thus:
  Server and client have a shared secret. The server sends the time, or
some random # to the client which MD5's this number and the secret, and
sends the result back to the server which then checks is.
  Similar to the APOP command for POP3 that I've never seen implemented.

Hey! I'm not a total dunce!  The cgi I wrote (ok, ok, hacked) includes
cracklib support. It won't let people enter simple passwords.
  Yep, that's about it. And they want you to pay for using it in a
commercial venture (which my system will be eventually), and I can't
justify (or afford) the expense.

A slight correction. They are imposing a 6% tax on the Gross receipts of
all Internet Providers who have customers in Tacoma. This includes AOL,
Compu$erve, and my local favorites - aa.net and eskimo.com
  Tacoma also wants these companies to buy a $72 a year business license.
There are the beginnings of an uprising against this, the mayor has called
for it to be repealed, but the City Council (In all of its bureaucratic
wisdom) wants to wait and see what happens. There's a public meeting on the
27th of August.
  Plus the fact that the taxation of these services (well, IMHO all
taxation is ...) is not based on services provided to the business by the
city. My provider is located in seattle, and has lines in Tacoma. They use
no Tacoma services, and yet Tacoma says that the provider owes them money.
  Its just another grab for money by the simple minded bureaucrats.
Hopefully we can toss some more of these jokers out of office the next

@_subject: Police prepare stunning end for high-speed car chases 
Actually people have done this before, using amplified radar guns to fry
the electronics in newer cars. That's why I've always favored pre  '70s
vehicles. You can work on em, and they can't be shot from under you with
new hi-tech weapons.
  I wonder what will happen in the insurance industry when cops start
using these devices to stop car thieves. They'll recover the car but it
will require a whole new brain (and who knows what else). I'm suprised
that the Clinton administraion hasn't called for a car-escrow system
whereby duly authorized law enforcement officials (with the permission of
a Judge od course) can send a signal to your car's computer to make it
shut off (or slow down or whatever).

@_subject: $10K offer if you can break the code 
Looks like a crock to me. He gives no email address to contact him with,
no business name, and it sounds like an extremely user un-friendly program.
People are definatly better off using PGP.
  I'd bet that his unpublished algorithm is an XOR with the key, and that
it could be broken pretty easily. I'd also be that there is no $10,000
  People like this guy give cryptography a bad name. They target people who
don't know much and are susceptible to his claims and who would be better
off using PGP or ViaCrypt.
  What can we do to dispute his claims? Has anyone gotten a copy of his
sample message yet?

@_subject: Orbiting Datahavens 
With all the recent talk about converted oil-rig DataHavens floating
around the oceans, fending off pirates, and Low-Orbit satellite
communications, I had a thought.
  How about an orbiting DataHaven. No jurisdiction to bother with,
extremely difficult to get to (except by large governments...). You could
put together a couple of Linux boxes with a RAID system, some backups and a
large solar panel and have a very nice, secure DataHaven.
  Granted, you wouldn't have all the fun of floating around the south
pacific fending off pirates and navies who are after your data, but it
would work. Might even be cheaper than outfitting the oil-ring with the
rate that they are tossing satellites into space.
  If the HAM radio community can get a satellite into space, why not the
Cypherpunks/Linux communities?

You'd have to make sure everything was soldered in pretty well, but it
could be done. As for solar flare, etc. protection it won't need anything
that any other satellite system would need.
  Embarrasingly enough, I cannot remember its name. I don't have a HAM
license (although I've studied for it -- just never took the test), but my
boss does. I think the satellite was launched in the mid to late 80's, and
it used for experimental communications.
  Good idea, I'll start a link on my webpage :>
  We'd want someone more reliable than ESA! I doubt that we could afford
to have a backup satellite in case of a disaster. Once the Delta Clipper
is functional the payload costs to orbit is supposed to drop tremendously.

@_subject: SpamBot 
Well, with all the other noise in the list lately, I'll add a little of
my own. I woke up today to find my mailbox filled with 20 messages from a
'careernetonline.com' offering to spread my resume across the net for $60.
  It was one of those terrorist spams where they apologize for wasting your
time and tell you that you can stop getting spammed by replying to the
message. Well, I really hate giving in to terrorists, no matter what form
they take. And I'm sick and tired of spam.
  So, I'm starting a project called SpamBot. You feed it a message and a
list of addresses and the bot send the message to those addresses until
they reply with an appropriate message indicating that they are at least
looking into the problem.
  Some people may say that this is sinking to their level. So it is, but I
think its time that system administrators realized that there are people
who don't appreciate being the target for shotgun marketing schemes (none
of which have been of any use to me).
  Watch my webpage for more info on this helpful little bot.

I'd also recommend using mouse clicks. I think that most windows users
(going from personal experience) spend much more time clicking through
messages than typingon the keyboard. A combination of several events should
provide 'even better' randomness.
