    If it takes a college student four hours to break
    a 40bit code it should take him/her about six     hours to do the same to 56bits. Then what excuses     are the government and its butt-kissing companies     going to give us for not allowing *real* coding?

    Rick seems to be missing the point about strong encryption -- the reason that DES/IDEA encryption
    is hard to crack is because the key system is based on the fact that factoring big numbers is a long,
    slow tedious process which gets exponentially harder as the length of the number increases. What this
    means is that it'll probably take the college student, ooh... 24 hours to crack a 56 bit key.

Message-Id is intended to be unique to a message and can be used
to reject duplicates. Usenet software in particular, detects

there will *not* be gatewayed to Usenet. As I mentioned, I will
not post to Usenet with my real email address, and if all lists
get gatewayed to alt.cypherpunks, I have to set up fake email

lists can gaurantee that it won't be gatewayed to Usenet, I
don't have to do that, and as a nice bonus, Prof. Froomkin
can continue to be active on cypherpunks.
This can be achieved by the list software adding an
"X-Post-to-Usenet: No" or some similar header to every
message it sends out. Also a header, such as X-List:
should be set to indicate under which mailing list a message
first entered the system. This will be worthless unless all
the list servers honor these headers.

No such development outside the US has been publicized.
However, it is easy enough to roll your own.
What you need:
1) Eric Young's libdes. ftp://ftp.psy.uq.oz.au/pub/Crypto/DES
2) Svend Olaf Mikkelsen's fast replacement for the core DES routine.
The latest libdes is supposed to have this faster routine incorporated
already, so you may not need it.
3) Peter Trei's article on "Optimizing DES Key Recovery in Software".
It is available at HKS's news server.
news://nntp.hks.net/<199610171918.MAA23054 at toad.com>
For a first pass, you can just implement the Gray Code technique. That
gives most of the speedup.
4) Some information on how to implement Gray Codes.
"The Gray Code" by Robert W. Doran. Tech Report 131 from
Given these resources, it shouldn't take long for a
good programmer to implement a DES key search program that
is in the same ballpark of performance as Peter Trei's implementation.

@_subject: EAR questions. 
[ Didn't get much response when I posted this to cryptography at c2.net.
Hope there will be more response on cypherpunks. ]
after reading relevent sections of the EAR, and talking to some
people. I am looking for considered opinions, not legal advice.
1) Does a software such as the DESCHALL client or Peter Trei's DESKR
program, in object code form, need a license to be exported? Keep
in mind that even thought there are some cryptographic functions
inside the programs, they cannot be directly used to encrypt data,
nor can they be easily modified (i.e. without reverse engineering)
to make data encryption possible.
2) Does the "printed matter exception" apply only to publications?
Is it legal, under the EAR, for somebody in the US to print out
the source code for an encryption program on paper and send it to
a private party abroad (not a country in the enemies list). Does
it make any difference whether this is done for monetory compensation?
Does it make any difference whether the sender intends to keep the
source code secret between himself and the recipient?
Btw, it looks like the language about scannable encryption source code,
that was in the draft regulations, have been removed.
One more, general question.
3) Is it correct to say that, as long as you are not selling it to
a military organization and the software is intended for civilian
use, the export of encryption software is now controlled exclusively
by the EAR, and not by the ITAR? I ask this because many of the
people who answered "only publications" to question 2) above,
could only quote the ITAR in support of their position.

Since I am going to quote portions of the EAR and make some comments
on it, let me begin by stating that I Am Not A Lawyer, and none of this
is to be taken as legal advice, or even accurate.
some time reading the EAR. For example, by reading the
relevant sections of the EAR and correlating it with the
Immigration and Naturlization Act, I figured out that
it would be illegal for somebody in the US to give me
encryption software, though it would be OK for them
to give the same code to a certain class of illegal
immigrants. During all this, I didn't come accross a section which
said that "hooks" or something similiar (used to be known as a DES
shaped hole), cannot be exported without a license. I was hoping
that some of the lawyers who frequent cypherpunk, whose job
it might to understand these regulations would be generous
enough to post a pointer.
    (ii) You may not, without a license from BXA, provide certain
technical assistance to foreign persons with respect to encryption
items, as described in Sec. 744.9 of the EAR.//
persons with respect to encryption items.
    (a) General prohibition. No U.S. person may, without a license from
BXA, provide technical assistance (including training) to foreign
persons with the intent to aid a foreign person in the development or
manufacture outside the United States of encryption commodities and
software that, if of United States origin, would be controlled for
``EI'' reasons under ECCN 5A002 or 5D002.
5A002 is for hardware modules that do encryption functions. 5D002 applies
to software. I won't quote it here, but from my reading it lists
only software designed or modified for certain purposes, such as putting
it in a hardware module, for one.
references to technical assistance, so I would think this is all
the restriction that is there, but as I said, IANAL, and I haven't
read the whole EAR.
