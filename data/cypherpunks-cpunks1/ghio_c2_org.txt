@_subject: NONE 
Well, I finally got a chance to catch up on a lot of email that I hadn't had
time to read recently.  I had to take myriad.pc.cc.cmu.edu down for awhile.
It should be back up in a few weeks.  My alias-based remailers,
alias at alpha.c2.org and mg5n+alias at andrew.cmu.edu are still up.  c2.org has
been having network connection problems lately and some messages may have
been delayed, but to my knowledge nothing has been lost.
For those who have been asking, help files are available by sending
mail to help at alpha.c2.org, mg5n+remailer-help at andrew.cmu.edu, and a
list of remailers and mail to usenet gateways is available from
mg5n+remailers at andrew.cmu.edu

@_subject: Encrypted TCP, telnet, etc 
I am using it.  It works fine on Linux and was very easy to set up.
Just -DLINUX in the makefile and build it.  Then put it in your inetd
or start the server standalone.  I use
% cryptod 49374 &
to put it on port 49374 (Look at it in hex ;-)
My biggest gripe with it is that it doesn't like Sparcs too much.
I finally did get it to compile but it still seems to occasionally
crash during key-exchange for no apparent reason. :(
Which is weird because it never crashes under Linux.  oh well.
I'm using v0.9, which I got from utopia.  Is there a newer version?

@_subject: alpha.c2.org nymserver source code 
I have packaged up the source for the nymserver I run on alpha.c2.org,
and written a brief description of how to install it.  E-mail me if you
want it.

@_subject: Commercial Speech over Internet product 
The program is a sound-listening extention for web-browsers.  There is
really no use for crypto because it's only processing information which
is already public.

@_subject: Risks of writing a remailer 
I've never heard of anyone complaining that I wrote a remailer.  A few
were upset at my running a remailer, but nobody every complained that the
software was available.
As far as minimizing attention to yourself, you obviously know how to
post anonymously.

@_subject: p-NEW digital signatures 
Yes.  In this case a fake signature can be forged by picking a random r, and
then z can be calculated as:
z=my^(-r) mod p
No security at all.
