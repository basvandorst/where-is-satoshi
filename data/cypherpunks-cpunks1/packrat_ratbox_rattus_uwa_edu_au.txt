In message <199602172002.MAA09152 at netcom20.netcom.com>, Interesting idea. Trends may be externally visible, You would probably
want to normalize it, and you would find that there was quite a few
deterministic elements of network load -> delay.
Oh, did I mention clock granularity?
In short you really aren't going to get 'random numbers' from such a
scheme, but that's not to say you couldn't have fun playing with it,
you might even find some use for the ways of calculating immediate
network load around a node. Especially with regard to interception of
packets and allowing for time discrepancies whilst doing so.
Altogether off topic, but could maybe be developed into an idea with,
maybe a 30% change of being Perrygrammed. Keep working.
Bounce me the code, could be interesting

In message <199602190657.BAA00505 at bb.hks.net>, True, there is a certain amount of indicision in my mind as to the
value of keeping software valuable through sale, and obtaining it
virtually free of charge. Yes I develop software.
Uh huh? And you are saying that there were *heaps* of computers out
there which could run MS-DOS which didn't come with it? And how much
more would those companies have made had the products been *forced* to
be sold rather than pirated.
Of course these days, with M$ having the monopoly over all software on
PC's and Billy being worth what he is, it's a moot point...
Intellectual property is all very well to develop, but it should
really be considered a limited resource at any point in time, and as
such be ownership restricted in much the same way as natural resources
are in Oz.
Mining licenses are only kept where the owner can show a certain
amount of development. In the same way patents of "intellectual" or
developing technology should be granted under a license to develop
principle only. (with the option to lose)
I'm not saying that intellectual property should come any more under
the banner of Big Sibling[1], but the existing regulatory bodies
should probably be forced to adopt these measures.
[1] This might be in an archive by the time that the CDA Mk II comes
out with the politically correct clauses.[2]
[2] I'm not laughing. My country's regulatory body sat this week to
start on our 'net legislational recommendations. I hope to hell you
people get your CDA sorted out before our lot uses it as a precedent.

One has to wonder about the security of binaries random people put up

And before I get totally off topic, on the subject of the Singaporean
government and their attitude to do-what-you-will liberalism (hah!),
just as a bit of noise, what sexual practices are illegal in Singapore?
Now that's *way* off topic, but what is there in the way of
enforcement for said regulations. More specifically, any info
generally on the whole Singapore law-enforcement system. Not of course
the public things, but it's intelligence stuff.
if AC is considered subversive... Mass media has had some interesting
articles about the Singapore govt being a little worried about being
either isolated or forced to abandon their vaunted censorship
role. Article itself was rubbish, but the idea behind it was interesting.

In message <2.2.32.19960124014532.0095ac74 at panix.com>, "Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by
stupidity" (or journalists) Of course with paranoia being almost
compulsory around here, it's probably a government plot to discredit
all people who want privacy. To be frank I doubt the NSA or anyone
else is going to bother, they can get what they want *anyway*
He probably should be. I mean, it would mean he only got *one* copy of
mail rather than all those concerned people cc:ing him a copy.
Mind you, its not as though the government's policies have *ever* been
relevant. Of course, having a less open government in my own country,
no-one has bothered to define what the goverment is going to do re:
trying to enforce low encryption standards or (hah!) censoring the net
in general.
In fact, at least the US *has* a centralish government. Here, where we
have only a handful of quite autonomous states, any one of which could
decide to implement some ridiculous scheme to "crack down on kiddie
porn" which would have the unfortunate effect of removing individual's
rights to privacy.
Which brings me to another point. At least you people *have* a free
speech bit in your constitution. While it's generally considered a
right here, legally that's not really good enough.

I'll tell you what, seeing as I *can't* export cryptostuff against

well and good.
OTOH the cause needs a few martyrs.

Microsoft OSs but not yet implemented under Unix. (which doesn't in

If secure input is needed then it shouldn't be too much of a
problem. I doubt the program would recognize either of INTERCAL input
or output (as a random example)
But it's hardly *new* as you say. All in all, a quite convincing
little article. Could almost be worth modifying and posting to the
Germans about something or other.

Damn germans. I guess that they really haven't changed a hell of a lot
over the past few decades. No wonder that every other European race
(pretty much) sterotypes them.
Personally I have quite a bit of confidence that my government isn't
going to worry about encryption stuff until technology passes them
by. I am not at all unhappy about this.
