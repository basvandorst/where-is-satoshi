By the way, the IRS (in spite of it's shortcomings) is (by far) the
most efficient tax collecting organization among the major economic
powers.  It costs roughly $0.50 per $100 collected.  Canada is second
at about $1, Germany (for instance) is at about $7, mostly because they
don't have payroll deductions.
