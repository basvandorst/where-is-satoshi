@_subject: Question (GCHQ) 
I live not too far away from Cheltenham, and I can confirm that the UK
Government would have rather a hard job ever denying the existence of GCHQ.
As you leave the M5 motorway at junction 11, taking the dual carriageway
into Cheltenham, the signposts for GCHQ can't be missed. (Left at the
second roundabout.) The building is visible to anyone driving into
Cheltenham. (If you carry on towards the town centre for another mile or so,
the Police HQ building has a rather impressive aerial on its roof, albeit
comparable to other Police HQs.) It seems reasonable to believe that the various secret service agencies
have reciprocal arrangements to tap each other's citizens. E.g. the
American agencies tap the Royals' phones, then repeatedly rebroadcast
the tapes using powerful transmitters, so they're almost certain to be
picked up by some radio ham, or retired bank manager with a scanner,
within a day or two.
