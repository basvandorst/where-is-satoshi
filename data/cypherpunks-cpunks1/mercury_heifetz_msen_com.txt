Why    WHY THINGS ARE MEASURED BY NUMBERS NEAR ONE
by Michael E. Marotta
We naturally choose scales that are naturally in tune with Nature.  To do otherwise would be unharmonious and would be rejected by practice over time.  Here are the numbers from an article about the Great Lakes in the World Book Encyclopedia.
5       lakes
1       in US
4       border
1909    year of treaty
94,650  combined area
600     alt of Superior
245     alt of Ontario
325     drop from Erie to Ont
1900    Chicago canal opened
1,000   miles inland
20      drop in St. Mary's
3       canal groups
1959    St. Law Seaway
182     miles of Seaway
2       times more than Panama
Depths  Areas
1333    31,800      Superior
923     22,400      Michigan
750     23,000      Huron
