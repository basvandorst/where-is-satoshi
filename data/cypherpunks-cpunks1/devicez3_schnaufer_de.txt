(but honestly i dont snack alot when you eat so much protein you dont get hungry as often through the day)
grant and i listened and danced to his music on valentines day i am given glimpses of the why and the good and the reasons and the plan the bigger picture and the necessity for some to not fit the mold
i got a lot emails about what i eat and how it effects pcos- so i hope you dont mind if i just answer all the questions here instead of going through each email
remember when the weather was warm and we would go to the park when daddy got home from work and we would bring homemade bread and fruit to eat for dinner and we would be drenched in golden light and the cousins would come meet us for some wild rides down the slide messes are piling up around me making it hard to relax and get well i cant cuddle grant or cate- they need to stay well- so they are steering clear of me i am bored and tired and achy
i really really need my bedroom to be simple and uncluttered and white for calming purposes you know what i mean
i couldnt find a video of him performing it but listen to the lyrics one thing i enjoy about facebook is the old pictures that friends and fam upload to walk down memory lane together with you the girl loves chocolate milk
one more thought about best friends
