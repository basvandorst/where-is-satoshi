@_subject: In need of help for a paper 
in nature, for a paper I am writing. My topic is a discussion of the current data encryption debate within the administration. Dorothy Denning) in its National Security Studies Program. This paper is for a class on Intelligence and National Security. My goal is to try to inform my fellow students about the right to privacy crisis going on in the data encryption area. Basically I am looking for any references to good articles and books about this topic. They can be discussions or very technical, I don't care. So if you know of anything that could help, please let me know.
