@_subject: Status of opportunistic encryption 
Some years back I worked on the FreeS/WAN project (freeswan.org),
IPsec for Linux.
One of our goals was to implement "opportunistic encryption", to allow any
appropriately set up machines to communicate securely, without
between the two system administrators. Put authentication keys in DNS; they
look those up and can then use IKE to do authenticated Diffie-Hellman to
the keys for secure links.
Recent news stories seem to me to make it obvious that anyone with privacy
concerns (i.e. more-or-less everyone) should be encrypting as much of their
communication as possible. Implementing opportunistic encryption is the
best way I know of to do that for the Internet.
I'm somewhat out of touch, though, so I do not know to what extent people
are using it now. That is my question here.
I do note that there are some relevant RFCs.
RFC 4322 Opportunistic Encryption using the Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
RFC 4025 A Method for Storing IPsec Keying Material in DNS
and that both of FreeS/WAN's successor projects (openswan.org and
strongswan.org) mention it in their docs. However, I don't know if it
actually being used.

I'm new to the list and now browsing the archives to get up to
date, so I figured I night as well make a list as I went and
post it.
Things I'd say are no-brainer choices to include as part
of the box, assuming they are solid enough.
Open Source self-hosted social networking,
ZRTP encrypted VoIP:
Secure distributed file system
Open Source online payment system
Privacy-protecting single ID scheme:
Everything else:
Overlay networks
Co-operative Routing
Clock radio with network

Speaking of protecting oneself, here's an Icelandic MP on the US gov't
grabbing data from her Twitter account.
THis sort of thing is another good reason for the Box.

@_subject: Metadata anonymization through time delayed email messaging. 
if you control the end-user sending machine & it runs some sort of Unix,
this is trivial; the required command is just:
at 04:00 mail whoever < message_file
Writing a script to do this using a random time would not be hard.
Of course this does not encrypt the file, though it could send a file
that was already encrypted. Nor does it provide any sort of
protection against someone who can snoop on the sending
machine (nothing I know of does!), so it does not work in your
Internet cafe example.
Better to modify the mail server to introduce a random delay.
This also does not look hard. Avoiding time stamps in the
Received: lines in the headers would also be necessary,
but that looks straightforward as well.
To block tracking, you also want to avoid putting the client
machine's IP address in the headers. Easily done, but it
makes it harder to deal with spammers.
