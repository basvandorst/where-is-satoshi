I am working on that exact problem. It is not really that trivial. The
encryption has to handle a lot of data real time. I have a license
agreement for IDEA and am working on RSA. I am thinking of using tripple
DES rather than IDEA because of the cost of the IDEA license.
Two questions. One: Does anyone know of a good source of DES chips?
Two: How much would you pay for a good encrypted phone?

@_subject: RemailerNet 
Quoth Jonathan Rochkind :
I have been worrying a lot about these anonymous return addresses. They seem
very vulnerable to attack.
Say I post a message through remailers to Cypherpunks giving one of these
reply blocks. The TLA need only send a flood of known size messages to this
address, and look to see where the pop out of the net of remailers. Even if
all messages were quantized and only reconstructed by the final recipient, the
TLA could send timed bursts of messages which (even with reordering) would allow a statistical determination of the recipient.
I think that the solution to this is some sort of hold and forward on demand
system. An anon ID would be posted to Cypherpunks, and that account ID with
a key, sent to the message holder. One would then request for a certain number
of messages or number of kilobytes of messages to be sent to the address
specified by the old sort of remailer block. This message would be signed by the
key, and could indicate remailing to anywhere, even to another hold and forward
location. This prevents the TLA from sending many messages to the final
destination in such a way that they could be used for traffic analysis.

I am not sure I see why you think that the "cherries" will line up.
If one has the two honest remailers in the chain, then the only information
the TLA has is that you sent a message, and the other person received one of
the N messages in the labyrinth. N is the number of messages sent which could
have been the received message (this is proportional to the number of messages
in being reordered). It all depends on how big N is. Given the current traffic
load, I suspect you are correct.

@_subject: PGP Tools under Linux (Pr0duct Cypher) 
Ok, I grabbed second oldest version (this included a bugfix).
I compiles and seems to work fine when I use it with PTD.
It fails when run under Mixmaster. The failure is deep inside pgptools.
When I call pgpk_findkey to get a key from a public key ring (by name not
number), it chugs along checking each key id in the ring. Each time it
checks a key, it uses a pair of fifo's which it then destroys. After checking
the second id, when it is destroying kc (k is destroyed without problems both
times), I get a segmentation violation in the line
   nfb=fb->next;
Since kc was simply a copy of k
  kc=fifo_copy(k);
I suspect the problem lies in fifo_copy. These are all mem fifo's.
If you want to look at the source code I am playing with (with tons of debugging
printfs in it) let me know and I will stick it on my ftp.

@_subject: nym based remailer proposals 
Current nym based remailers suffer from the same insecurity that all return
address share. It is easy for an opponent to trace a return address by
sending many messages to that address, and watching the traffic generated.
If the remailer uses a database of nyms to real names (like Julf's penet
remailer) then all security rests with the integrity of the operator and
the security of that one system. These security problems can be avoided,
while still providing the benefits of a "replyable" address.
I suggested the following scheme at the last San Diego Cypherpunks meeting.
It was well received there, so I hope it will be of interest.
Having read the help files, this is my understanding of how the current nym
based remailers work. I send an anonymous reply block to the nym remailer,
which puts it in a database, along with my chosen nym. This can all be done
through remailers. Now anyone can send mail to nym at remailer.address.com and
it will be sent to me using the reply block I sent.
I propose two changes:
1) To facilitate replying to nyms, I should be able to send mail to the
remailer indicating the nym it should appear to be from. Then a recipient
would simply hit reply, and the response would go back to the real sender.
2) I propose the use of message pools rather than return addresses. With
enough subscribers, the best way to do this would be using mailing lists.
There already exist many tools which could filter out all pool message
other than yours. Until that time, alt.anonymous.messages would be a better
choice. To be practical, both of these schemes require that the user be
able to filter out messages to other nyms.
The remailer (which might be better called a nym server) should place the
subject line of the incoming reply in the body of the message, and replace
the subject line with some searchable string (e.g. To Nym: Pr0duct Cypher).
Searching alt.anonymous.messages for your nym in the subject line would
reveal all messages to you.
While the current system would allow me to have messages sent to a message
pool using a mail-to-news gateway, I am not now able to search for messages
to me, and I can not send messages "From: " my nym.

I am not completely clear on what sort of communication you are trying to
protect, and what your threat model is.
Are you worried about an attacker noticing that an anonymous ID is getting a lot
of messages? If you are using PGP and a message pool, any attacker can decrypt
all the messages, and see which correspond to which key, and therefor to which
anonymous ID. The only way around this is to use private key crypto. If you are
doing that, then you can also use a shared secret to generate a stream of one
use message IDs.

@_subject: Standard Packet size. 
I am about to release Mixmaster as a beta test. Before I do, I would like some
input on what size message packet to standardize on.
Each message includes twenty 1k headers, and a block with the message text.
Right now I have the text block size set to 4k. That seems small, but I am
worried about mail systems choking on big messages. Messages over the minimum
size are sent separately (through the same chain), and only recombined by the
last remailer in the chain. Previous remailers do not know that the message
parts are associated. This is quite secure, but not as good as a single packet,
so the fewer messages that get split up, the better. Mixmaster compresses the
contents of the text block.
So, any thoughts on what size the text block should be?
BTW Mixmaster still only runs on Sun. Several people are working on porting it
to linux. Help with porting to PC and Mac would be appreciated.

@_subject: 1st Draft Mixmaster chaining instructions 
Here is the first draft of the instructions for using Mixmaster to
build remailer messages. I am posting it to give a flavor of what the
program does, and to request comments, both on the features and on
the clarity of the help file itself.
Instructions for using Mixmaster to create type 2 remailer messages.
I assume that you have either compiled Mixmaster, or that you have acquired
a precompiled copy.
While you do not need PGP to use Mixmaster, it is useful for key
management, and is required if you desire security of the content of the
message you are sending (which will be visible to the last remailer).
Theory and purpose of remailers:
The purpose of anonymous remailers (hereafter simply remailers), is to
provide protection against traffic analysis. Traffic analysis is the study
of who you are communicating with, when, and how often. This reveals more
than you might expect about your activities. It will indicate who your
friends and colleagues are (and they can be told apart by looking at the
times you contact them). What your interests are, from which catalog
companies you contact, and which ftp and WWW sites you visit. Traffic
analysis can even reveal business secrets, e.g. your frequent contact with
a rival could give hints of an impending merger.
Remailers protect your email from traffic analysis. The original remailers
did this by removing all headers, except the subject line, from any message
you sent to them and then forwarding them a destination of your choice. The
recipient of such a message would not know who had sent it.
The addition of encryption to this scheme gave significant protection from
attackers who simply look at passing messages for to and from fields.
Passing a message through several remailers in a row is much better, but
still vulnerable to an attacker who can watch messages go into and out of
each remailer.
Two more elements are required: messages must be reordered within the
remailer before being forwarded (this is being done by a few of the old
style remailers), and all messages must be indistinguishable. This last is
the primary improvement with the type 2 remailer, Mixmaster.
Using type 2 remailers:
The trend towards ever more complicated remailer message formats has been
clear for some time. Several programs have been written to automatically
build messages which will be remailed by several remailers. This process is
called chaining.
With type 2 remailers it is no longer possible to create these messages by
hand. Mixmaster takes a message you wish to send, a list of remailers to
chain it through, and a final destination, and builds the packet which the
remailers will use. For simplicity I will first describe the interactive
use of Mixmaster, then I will discuss how it can be controlled through
command line arguments.
Interactive use of Mixmaster:
If you run Mixmaster with no arguments, you will be prompted for all the
required information.
First you will be asked to specify the final destination of the message.
This is the full email address where you want your message delivered.
Remember that the message is being sent by the last remailer in the chain,
so you must specify the full internet address (e.g.
name at machine.place.com), you may not use local mail aliases. You may enter
multiple recipients on separate lines. Hit return on a blank line to stop
entering destinations. You must have at least one.
Next you will be asked to enter any headers you want to have inserted
before the message. These are those lines  at the beginning of email
messages, like From: fred at bedrock.univ.edu, or Subject: Party invitation.
If you want your message to have a subject when it is delivered, you must
enter a line
A subject header can be added by using the -s command line argument.
When you are done entering headers, hit return (it is OK to have zero headers).
You will now be presented with a list of  remailers through which you can
chain your messages. The order in which you choose them is the order in
which they will be traversed by your message. You may choose up to 20 of
them, but remember that the reliability and speed of the chain diminish as
the number of remailers in the chain increases. Four is a reasonable number
of remailers to use. It is fine to use a given remailer more than once in
your chain. Press return on a blank line to stop entering remailers.
Finally you will be asked what file you want to send. This must be an ASCII
file. You may either enter the name of an existing file, or you may choose
to enter the message directly by typing "stdin" as the file name. This is
intended for use by scripts. There are no editing capabilities when using
stdin. Enter the end of file character (EOF is ^D) when you are done
entering the file.
Mixmaster will now build the type 2 remailer packet, and send it to the
first remailer in the chain.
Command line arguments to Mixmaster:
Mixmaster [-c] [in.filename] [-f] [-s "subject"] [-o "outfile"] [-to
a at b.com] [-l 3 2 6 ...]
 -c      this indicates that chaining rather than remailer functions are
desired. It is a NOP since chaining is the default operation.
"filename"      if a filename is given, then this will be used as the input
file. As in the interactive mode, you may choose "stdin". No filename will
be prompted for.
 -f      filter mode. All prompts suppressed, but input still accepted as
described in the interactive section. The remailer list must be specified
on the command line.
 -s "subject"    Adds a subject line to the message. The user should NOT
include Subject: in this string. Mixmaster will not prompt for other
headers if -s is used.
 -o "outfile"    Specify an output file rather than sending the message to
the first remailer automatically. If outfile is "stdout", then the remailer
packet will be printed to stdout.
 -to foo at bar.org specifies the final destination of the message. Only one
destination can be specified. Mixmaster will not prompt for other
destinations if -to is used.
 -l 4 3 5 ...    Specifies the list of remailers to chain through. This must
be the last argument on the command line. A maximum of 20 remailers may be
specified. Mixmaster will not prompt for other remailers if -l is used.

@_subject: REMAILER PROPOSAL 
Lets call all the "Spoon-E"s you buy at one time, using one ID number, a
roll. If the "Spoon-E" issuer, and the first remailer in one of your
chains, collude they can identify all of your messages using any stamps
from that roll.
The issuer keeps a log of all ID numbers and "Spoon-E" numbers. A remailer
sends the address of each sender, along with the "SpoonE" number of the
message. Now any message with a stamp from the same roll can be assumed to
be from the same person.
Unless you are sending many messages through the bramble at the same time,
you are providing wonderful traffic analysis to the issuer. He will know
when and approximately when each of your hops was. This almost collapses
you chain to the security of a single hop.
A solution to this would be to use a different roll for each hop (not each
remailer), and one for each destination. You would have one "first hop"
roll, which would be easy to identify with you. Several rolls would be for
intermediate hops (no roll used twice in one chain). You would also keep
one roll per final destination, which could be easily identified with the
recipient, but not with you.

I disagree with you assessment of the situation. The "Electronic Mail
Forwarders Guild" is not made of mind readers, they are capable of error.
You assume that a operator would appear to be untrustworthy. I think that
is a poor assumption. As an example, I have been talking to John Perry
quite a bit lately, he has been of great help to me, his heart seems to be
in the right place, he is certainly militant enough about remailer
secutiry. I am not at all convinced that he has not been compromised
(nothing personal John). It simply does not require that good an actor. If
a TLA wished to infiltrate us, the traitor would seem very trustworthy,
gung ho, and paranoid.
I think that the odds of the "Electronic Mail Forwarders Guild" choosing a
compromised Spoon-E Issuer is much greater than the odds that all members
of some subset of my choosing have been compromised.
The system you proposed is interesting, and worthy of discussion, but I
will not actually use any system where I must put identifying information
in each packet. There are ways of implementing postage which do not require
this compromise. Blind signed tokens is one method. Having the user pay the
first remailer, with remailers charging each other a reduced rate for
forwarding is another.
You make no mention of my scheme for making your system completely secure
(I think). It should not be too difficult to implement, given the software
you would already need for Spoon-Es.

Mixmaster is both a remailer and a front end, and therefor must run on many

That is about right. Inside the armor is a bunch of binary data. 20 header
blocks, and the message block. The first message block is a PGP encrypted
to the remailer, and contains the next destination. The other 19 headers,
and the message block are IDEA encrypted with a key and IV in the first
header. When decrypted, the second header is seen to be PGP encrypted to
the next remailer, and the rest is encrypted with the key in that header.
The remailer Shifts up all the headers, sticks junk in the 20th header, and
rearmors the whole thing.
This is rather more active manipulation than the current remailers.
I realize that. It was easy to implement, since I already had to check for
:: to be compatible with type 1 messages.
I agree that changing mixmaster to search for a MIME line, rather than the
:: would be no effort at all.
I use sendmail for the client and the remailer (actually they are the same
code), so adding new headers is easy. Unfortunately I am having some
problems with sendmail. Sendmail is marking the messages as "Apperently

I like this. One complication comes to mind with chaining. You can not set
up the whole chain at once. That would give it all away. In some sense you
are only mixed with other people who build these "chain links" at the same
time. Since you are only likely to build one or two (once built there is no
reason to take it down), you want to build it very slowly to allow many
links to be built out of the machine you are connected to before you build
your link out the next machine in the chain.
Also, if other people take their chains down, you must too, or I suspect
that there will be some information pointing to the only chain not to have
changed (this would only be statistical). I am not so sure about this last
argument though.
