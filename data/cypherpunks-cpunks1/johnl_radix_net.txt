@_subject: Cheap Brute Force Attacks 
The use of idle cycles on workstations or PCs for brute force attacks
made me think about the economics of this problem. How cheaply could
a massively parallel system be built for key cracking? Much of the
cost and complexity of current massively parallel systems is in
the inter-processor communications and memory systems. Why not build
a system with a large number of single chip processors (ROM/RAM/IO on
one chip) and a simple/slow/cheap communication bus? I'm assuming that
each processor can attack a small chunk of the keyspace without needing
any external support. One or more PC boards could be populated with
an array of cheap processors. There would be a master controller to
assign chunks of key space and check for results. It could also download
the software if it was to be stored in on-chip RAM. A PC board could
be designed that would provide 5V power, a shared serial I/O bus and
a wired-or interrupt for the microprocessors to signal the master
controller that a key has been cracked. What would be a good microprocessor
for this task? It would have to be cheap, reasonably low power with
lots of integer MIPS. A decent amount of on-chip RAM would allow the
software to be downloaded instead of being masked or burned into ROM.
1000 processors could be put into a relatively small box, lets say
10 boards each containing 100 single chip microprocessors. It shouldn't
cost more than $10-$20 per processor, about the same total cost as
one decent workstation ($10K-$20K).

The problem is caused by local oscillator radiation interfering with
the ILS receiver. Tune a FM broadcast band receiver to the right frequency and
you get local oscillator radiation at (f + 10.7 MHz), right in the
middle of the aviation band.

@_subject: Sat phone permit "wire"taps 
Is there a technical reason why communications through these future
satellite systems couldn't be encrypted? I thought that all of these
systems were based on vocoders and digital transmission, just like
a secure telephone.
If the future telecommunications infrastructure is digital end to
end, the carriers are going to be transporting streams of bits
at some predetermined rate, not analog voice. Whether the bits are
mu law encoded audio or PGP encrypted pictures of Senator Exon and
his favorite gerbil should be irrelevant to the network.
I wouldn't conduct a sensitive conversation over a wireless or
cellular phone system. Why would the prospective customers of
a satellite based system be satisfied with a system that allows
anyone with the proper equipment to secretly monitor their
conversations? I assume the market for this type of system is
going to be lawyers, business executives and others who are
willing to pay the high rates. Just the sort of people who should
be concerned about the confidentiality of their conversations.

@_subject: Question on Galois Fields 
I wrote a Reed-Solomon encoder that had to do addition and multiplication
over GF(2^8). Addition was simple, just a bitwise exclusive-or.
Multiplication required two tables, a log-alpha table and an alog-alpha
table. The product was computed by taking the anti-log of the sum of
the logs of the arguments. Both tables were 256x8 lookup tables. The table
contents were derived from the generator polynomial G(x) specified
for the encoder. Another two 256x8 tables were used to translate between
dual basis and conventional basis. Dual basis was specified for the
encoder to make a hardware implementation simpler but I found that it was
easier to use conventional basis for a software implementation.
Not being a mathematician, I used several NASA technical reports on
Reed-Solomon encoders and an excellent book on error correcting codes
by Lin & Costello to understand enough of the math to write the
encoder software. Galois fields are heavily used in the design of
error correcting codes.

@_subject: maximizing cryptographic return 
It doesn't take much of a microprocessor to do real-time encryption and
decryption of digitized voice, at least for DES. The problem is the
vocoder. A good vocoder needs a fast DSP chip. A custom vocoder chip
could cut this cost considerably, look at how cheap data pumps for
V.34 modems have become with mass production. If ISDN ever becomes the
mass market standard, replacing analog local loops, it would be very
inexpensive to add encryption.
Even with today's phone system, I can't see why a mass market secure
telephone couldn't be built for less than $200. The problem is
convincing enough people that they need secure telephones to get
that mass market.
The secure telephone also needs to be transparent to the users.
It should be able to setup a secure connection without requiring
the user to press any buttons or know what hardware is at the other
end. The voice quality has to be much better than some of the
"Donald Duck" quality systems that have been used in the past.

@_subject: 64 bit crypto 
Couldn't we modify RC4 easily to provide the same
security against brute-force attacks by just running the key-setup phase
65536 times instead of just once?
Why would the attacker need to run the key setup 65536 times?

@_subject: 64 bit crypto 
My thought was that there might be shortcuts that the attacker
could use to compute the permutation of the state array in less time.
I wrote a small test program to look for cycles and weak keys in the
65536 iteration permutation. I assumed a 40 bit key. One weak key
was found, 0x0101010101, that produces a 255 iteration cycle.
375 randomly chosen keys were tested and no cycles were found.
There ought to be a faster way to compute the permutation with
a more analytical approach. My skepticism tells me that nothing
is a replacement for more key bits.
In a semi-related question, why don't we see Feistel systems with
larger numbers of rounds? Would a modified DES with 256 rounds be
any more secure than standard DES?
