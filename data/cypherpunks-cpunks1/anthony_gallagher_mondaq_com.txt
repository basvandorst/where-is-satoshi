I have had a look in our database and can see that you are not currently
susbscibed to newsletters. I have also marked your profile with a "no email"
flag. I also take your comment on board and will build a link from the "your
profile" link on the top right navigation bar to the newletters manager
page. Thank-you for using Mondaq.

Can't Find "Unsubscribe" or "Update Your Profile" except by dumb luck.
Somebody gave the address of our mailing list as the email address for
their subscription, and while it's interesting enough material, we don't
want it automatically sent to our list.  I tried to find the page to
unsubscribe, but can't find one.  We'd greatly appreciate it if you'd do
two things -
1) Remove the user "cypherpunks" from your mailing lists
2) Change the main menu on your pages to include an entry about "manage
your profile" or something similar,
and ideally also add an unsubscribe capability (though I can fake that by
just changing my email address to
nobody at nowhere.com.)
