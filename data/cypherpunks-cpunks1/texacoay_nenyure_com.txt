she wears birkenstocks to fashion shows. 3. i think that packages stacked all over the house are a nice decorative touch (and they remind me how good people are to donate to project 31) happy things! there's a tiny restaurant
i mean, look at her hair. happy happy days.
i am looking forward to a date with grant.
cate was so happy she began yelling "let's give a hand to springtime! when you need to be home, may you find your way.
we are happily enjoying being able to play outside again. i am blocking my two latest projects today and will show them tomorrow. i am determined to get the house clean so i can relax and sew tomorrow.
and my wheels are turning with projects to put together for a locals knitting class. time for a new spring look...
we ate corned beef and cabbage with irish soda bread last night in preparation for the day of the irish. it was super delicious. and a delicious coke.
back in a few days
i was given the irish name kelly after my great grandparents' last name. i am excited about my new running shoes.
soft and long lacy scarf light enough for spring, extra long for winter wrapping, elegant enough for church, cute enough for a tshirt...i really love this scarf pattern (gee can you tell?).
