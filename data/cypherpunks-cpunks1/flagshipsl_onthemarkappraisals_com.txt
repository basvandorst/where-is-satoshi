it's definately worth the long drive,
simple is always prettiest to me. i love the color palette and obvious softness. see you then!
they make me smile every day. What are your tips for clearing clutter so you can focus on such a project as sewing?" well mary, let me answer your question by showing you some examples of how i deal with clutter in different areas of my home:
here's an irish blessing from us to you...
trust me, you'll want her working her magic on you. haha, that's my girl. time for a new spring look...
wooohoooo!" i have always dreamed of going to ireland, (and scotland too- mccaleb), to research our family history, and to see the green grass in real life.
cate was so happy she began yelling "let's give a hand to springtime! i am going to turn on some good music and choose to be happy.
interested? i think it would be so fun. i am excited about my new running shoes.
i recommend rounding your troops for a similar conversation, and a brainstorm session for how to prepare for what lies ahead. just sayin.
i told cate about st. patrick's day and ireland- she has a lot of irish ancestors through me. i am so grateful for quiet time with the scriptures.
and my wheels are turning with projects to put together for a locals knitting class.
