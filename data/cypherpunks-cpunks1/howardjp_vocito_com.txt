I work in downtown DC (a few blocks from the White House) and this
morning saw a plain white blimp over Farragut Park.  This thing has
no insignia, no numbers, no markings at all and it spent all day
circling the city.
CNN, and numerous other sources explain this is an Army survellience
blimp.  Aside from posse comitatus, this is simply immoral.  I for
one welcome our new art deco overlords.
Here's the CNN story:
  Security blimp tested in Washington skies
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Here's a head-turner for a security-nervous city:
A large white object was spotted in the skies above the nation's
capital in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday.
Pentagon police said the Defense Department is testing a security
blimp -- fully equipped with surveillance cameras. The white blimp
was spotted early Wednesday morning hovering at various times over
the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol.
The 178-foot-long device, which is expected to remain in the skies
until Thursday, is conducting a mission for the Defense Department.
Authorities say the airship is equipped with infrared cameras
designed to provide real-time images to military commanders on the
ground. The equipment on the blimp already is being used to protect
troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The Army says the device will make at least one 24-hour flight in
the District of Columbia area. It has been in the region since last
week, and is also being used for test runs over the U.S. Marine
Corps Base in nearby Quantico, Virginia, and the Chesapeake Bay.
