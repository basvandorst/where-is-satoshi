Whatever we end up with, and I'm agreed that things are changing very
fast, that government will have to have the support of the people.  No
government lasts long without that.  And I'll end this political thread
now as it's a bit off-topic.

saying the msg bounced.  Sometimes the entire msg bounces for no
apparent reason.  Does this happen to anyone else? )

I've heard rumors through the years that CIA/NSA/whoever can aim a
parabolic antenna at your window, read the electronic pulses surrounding
your computer, and thusly determine what you are typing.  Is there any
truth to this?

But will a dictionary attack work when the passphrase is multiple words?
Because then it would have to try all the words in the dictionary
grouped with other worde, and the permutations thus become huge.
i.e. "spinachwalrusgazebo" is three words, and to me, would seem immune
from a dictionary attack, because the attack only uses single words.  Is
this right?

Then the typing of a passphrase could be intercepted - in the unlikely
event that one is deemed important enough to be monitored by several
people with some presumably expensive equipment - ah well, I'm not going
to worry about it.

Fugitive Relied On And Was Undone By Cellular Phone
Law enforcement officials subpoenaed the company ( AirTouch Cellular )
for assistance in tracking down O J Simpson.  Technicians began
monitoring calls made to and from the white Bronco.
Even if an eyewitness had not spotted the vehicle, such monitoring would
have made Simpson's capture inevitable.
Technicians in the tracking station can, if necessary, track a
particular call back to the cell site from which it originates.  But the
monitoring can not be done unless the phone is in use. [ Is that true? ]

Hot money ( investing money ) is always going wherever the best yield
is, and ignores national boundaries.  While this isn't capital investing
money, a big inflow/outflow to/from one country, especially a small one,
probably will affect the politics.
With global banking, and stock and commodity markets effectively open 24
hrs a day, this trend will increase.  For instance, the stock market of
Turkey zoomed up last year, and is zooming down now.  The hot money was
there last year as is leaving now.  This is undoubtably affecting their
internal politics.

I'd say that those moving the money around the world would be deeply
interested in privacy - their own.  Not necessarily for nefarious
reasons, but to protect the competition from knowing what they are
doing.  A 800-pound gorilla like the Fidelity Magellan Fund takes
elaborate precautions to not alert the market as to what they are buying
and selling.  Thus, I assume, they deeply value their own privacy.
Will the capital moving about the world be hostile to cypherpunks et al?
I doubt it.  Instead, they'll probably cherry-pick the best of crypto
technology and use it for themselves.  Besides, big money generally
isn't thrilled by governments and usually views national boundaries as
an annoyance, a view shared by many on the Net.

I'm a leftie and was also a bit bemused by the idea of using crypto to
avoid paying taxes.  Hopefully we can find a bit more exalted use of
crypto than that.
However, I assume all here are agreed that strong private crypto is a
good thing.  "Politics makes strange bedfellows", indeed.
This wouldn't be the first time that those on the fringes of the left
and the right saw a common enemy - encroaching government with control
in their hearts.

The bank might not care.  The IRS probably does and would insist on

Just like with real cash.  Possession is ownership.  Digital cash
involves crypto and, I assume, some type of personal ID?
