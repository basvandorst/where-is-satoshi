The notion of a computer virus predates THE SHOCKWAVE RIDER.  Gregory
Benford used the notion in a short story published in AMAZING STORIES in
1973 or 1974.  It was an idea mentioned in passing in a story taking
place in a mining town in Antarctica.  (Sorry, but I can't provide any
more bibliographic data than that; I'm relying strictly on memory.)
Benford definitely used the word "virus" to describe how the thing
reproduces. In 1975 (the same year that THE SHOCKWAVE RIDER came out) Laser Books
published the notoriously bad SEEDS OF CHANGE, by Thomas F.  Monteleone. Monteleone has the Evial Computer That Rules The World brought down by
feeding it something called a "Benford program," i.e. a virus.
I couldn't say for sure whether the idea of computer viruses was
original to Benford or not.  He is a theoretical plasma physicist who in
his misspent youth worked at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
the weapons program.  It is possible that he worked on numerical
modeling of plasmas in a secure computing environment, and that viruses
were part of the threat models of the Livermore computer security
If he did invent the idea, then he has a lot to answer for. . . .

@_subject: McCoy is Right! New Mail Format to Start Now. 
The right font on disk and a program that groks it.  Aye, there's the
rub. What makes this debate at once so fascinating and so frustrating is that
both sides are correct.
Yes, MIME is the standard that has emerged for exchanging non-ascii-text
data via email, and yes it's a damned good one, properly implemented. And yes, anyone with the resources to do so ought to connect to their
Internet service provider through a SLIP connection and be able to
move through the Web with a good graphical browser and view their mail
through their MIME-compliant mail program.  If you can do it, then it is
without a doubt the way to go.
But at the same time Tim is right, too.  SLIP connections, quality
Web browsers, and MIME-compliant email packages are the high end of Net
access today.  They demand either an investment of money (intelligently
spent) or an investment of effort to get the stuff up and running and to
get the know-how needed to do so.  Either of these can be more than many
people who are now Internet users can afford.
I think the people who are berating Tim for his apparent stubbornness
should stop and think for a bit.  It's not a simple matter of "We're
right, so Tim must be wrong."  The people who can look at the matter and
see how the MIME advocates and Tim May are both right, without seeing a
contradiction, will have a broader, deeper insight into the underlying
problems, and be able to come up with solutions that reach farther.

In article <199411172235.QAA19976 at jpunix.com>,
But (except for monitoring messages going into and out of the remailer,
or operator logging) how is anyone to know which remailers were involved
in a chain?  Isn't this one of the things that chaining is supposed to
prevent?  A more accurate objection might be that if spam/proprietary data is
chained through remailers, then EVERY remailer is at risk.  BTW, I think your safeguards (which I am _not_ objecting to) only make
it a little bit harder to use your remailer to post stolen code or
whatever.  Someone  could easily break the posts up into pieces and
chain them through your remailer, perhaps through different chains as
well, e.g.:
You could block multiple messages with the same or similar subject
fields, but anyone chaining remailers intelligently would probably not
use a single remailer as the final sending point -- unless they had it
in for that remailer!
Or are you going to block posts from remailers that forward spam to you?
(A cure worse than the disease, IMHO).

============================== START ==============================
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
In my view, delaying unsigned messages is only moderately better than
dropping them.  It punishes users for having non-crypto-friendly email
setups (and makes things somewhat more confusing for other list readers,
even the ones who sign their messages).
Yes, but you are denying the way in which delaying, like bouncing,
actively interferes with the timely forwarding of non-signers' messages,
while merely marking them is a more passive form of harrassment.  Yes,
there is a distinction between delaying and bouncing.  There is also a
distinction between battery and homicide.
You keep insisting that delaying unsigned messages does not interfere
with non-signers' abilities to participate in the discussion.  I say you
are wrong.  It's a positive hindrance.  It punishes people for
circumstances that may well be beyond their control.  It's a bad idea.
You maintain the list, you can do what you want.  As you can plainly see
(Tim's right on this one), I sign my posts to the list, and my posts
would get the favored treatment.  No one can stop you; but if you do
something that makes valued contributors take a walk, you wouldn't be
doing the list any favors.

you accept someone sticking a PGP signature into their .sig and using it

the huge number of people who wish to download them when their

The obvious fix here is the same as the proposed fix for remailer

As a (presumably) fixed-location data haven, one would want to be able
to use some kind of anonymous e-money for payment, but one could also
use good, old-fashioned credit card numbers, too.
The feelthy peexture business might well be the cash cow that keeps a

digital scrambling of the image.  The kidnapper's voice is scrambled
digitally.  The kidnapper pulls the hood off of the victim's head, and
speaks. KIDNAPPER:		Okay, you're on!  Talk!
The camera slowly zooms in on the victim's face.
VICTIM (tentatively):	Mom?  Dad?  It's me.

As an experienced professional in this field, I have learned that where

This thread is becoming isomorphic to one that took place on the

output of a PRNG "more" random by throwing away output whose statistics
didn't match the ideal statistics of an ideal RNG.  Critics of this
scheme (including Perry) argued along these lines:
Suppose you think that quotes from Hamlet don't belong in your OTP
keystream, and so you filter them out.  In doing so, you are making your

@_subject: An idea for refining penet-style anonymous servers 
Does the world need to have the anon.penet.fi model of anonymous email
and news posting refined, given the existence of Cypherpunks remailers
and Mixmaster digital mixes, not to mention nymservers?
I will listen respectfully to the arguments of the people who say "no",
and they're very likely right.  But penet *is* the most widely used
means of anonymous communication on the Internet - largely because of
its ease of use compared to genuinely secure remailers and mixes.
The other night, while sick and feverish with the flu, a scheme popped
into my head that would seem to make penet-style anonymous servers less
vulnerable to compromise through seizure of the remailer equipment or of
the address database.  In the cold light of day and normal temperature,
it still seems like a sound idea to me, and I wondered what other people
would think of it.
My scheme is the design of the address database.  It consists of two
hash tables, one for sending messages (which maps anonymous IDs onto
sender's addresses), and one for receiving them (mapping recipient's
addresses onto anonymous IDs).  A cryptographically secure hash (say,
MD5) is used for the index of both tables.
The index of the sending message table is the MD5 hash of the sender's
address.  The table entry the index points to is the sender's anonymous
ID, encrypted by a symmetric algorithm (maybe IDEA).  The encryption key
would be a different hash, by another algorithm (let's suppose it's
SHA), of that same address.
In forwarding a message, the server MD5-hashes the sender's address and
looks at the table.  If it doesn't find a corresponding entry, it
creates one.  If it *does* find an entry, it SHA-hashes the sender's
address and uses this key to decrypt the anonymous ID.  In the unlikely
event of collision the decrypted ID will be gibberish and the server
does something sensible (like appending padding to the address and
trying again).  The header information is filtered and the anonymous ID
inserted in the From: line. The receiving message hash table is designed similarly, in reverse.  The
index of the hash table is the MD5 hash of the anonymous ID; the entry
in the table is the recipient's email address, encrypted with the SHA
hash of the anonymous ID.  When a message comes in, the anon ID is
hashed and looked up in the table.  If  nothing is found, the message is
bounced. If an entry is found, the anon ID is SHA hashed and the table
entry decrypted.  If it is gibberish, a collision has taken place and
handled appropriately.  The message is then forwarded to its intended
recipient. What all this accomplishes is to obscure more information from attackers
and from honest operators.  In the event of abuse it is a simple matter
to find out who the abusers are and block them out.  If the operator is
subject to subpoena, anyone named in the subpoena can be easily
identified . . . *but nobody else can!*  Authorities cannot use a search
for one identity as an excuse for a fishing expedition in the address
database. (Obscuring information from honest operators can protect the operator
when questions of liability or even conspiracy come up.)
There is a way that attackers who have seized or copied the database can
search it - by trying it out on anonymous IDs, or user addresses, until
they hit paydirt.  And of course such an anonymous server can be no more
trustworthy than its operator; and the fundamental security limitations of
the penet-style anonymous server are well-understood.
So what do people think of this scheme of mine?  Are there drawbacks or
weaknesses that I'm not seeing?  Is it a good idea?  I'd really like it
if *something* good came out of being laid up with the flu.

Somebody, too clever for their own good by half, has come up with a
novel way of using Usenet and anonymous remailers to perpetrate
mailbombs.  The M.O. is to post a message to the naked-lady newsgroups
saying "get pics in your mailbox! send this message to this address!),
giving the email address of a cypherpunk-style anonymous remailer and
including a pgp-encrypted message block.
Thousands of horny net geeks will send in the message; some of them will even follow instructions correctly so the remailer forwards the
message to its intended target.  The result is that the target will
be mailbombed -- and the remailer operator can't stop the abuse by
blocking the abuser's address, because it's coming from all over the
net.  There is *no* chance that this is legitimate.  The remailer discards the
original message header.  There is no way for the recipient to know who
sent the email message.
Cypherpunks:  is there any way to respond to, or prevent, this sort of
attack short of actually shutting down the remailer?  What comes to my mind is the remailer operator grepping for a character
string of ASCII-armored cyphertext from the known attack message and
throwing messages containing it into the bit-bucket.  It is highly
unlikely that this would appear in any message except the attack
message.  The problem with this is that it works only for a known attack
message -- it can shut down an ongoing attack, but it can't prevent new

@_subject: Digital postage and remailer abuse (was Re: Novel use of Usenet and remailers to mailbomb from luzskru@cpcnet.com) 
In article ,
Maybe I'm misunderstanding how using digital postage with remailers would
work.  I was assuming that the postage stamp would be included *inside*
the encrypted envelope, that what the remailer would do on receipt of
mail would be: (a) decrypt the envelope; (b) validate the postage stamp;
and (if the stamp is valid) (c) forward the message according to the
now-decryped instructions.
Using this model, if the perpetrator doesn't include a postage stamp,
then the message is ignored.  If the perp includes a stamp, the first
horny net geek's message is relayed but subsequent ones get bounced for
invalid postage.
If the message requires external postage (remailer processing cycle is
process postage *before* decrypting envelope), then at the very least
the horny net geeks have to get their own postage stamps, putting a step
in the way of instant gratification.  What's more, doing this would
require *some* understanding of how the remailer network operates.  One
should never underestimate the degree of cluelessness present on the
net, but knowing how to use remailers makes it more likely that somebody
could recognize this as a mailbomb rather than a legitimate offer.
What's more, even external postage works to block this attack used with a chain of remailers, because the second remailer's stamp would have to
be provided by the perpetrator, inside the encrypted envelope sent to
the first one.
The very nature of this attack makes me wonder whether it would be
worthwhile to implement a digital postage scheme for remailers that
doesn't happen to be backed by real money.  The remailers would continue
to be free to use, and currency exchange hassles would be avoided, but
many of the benefits of abuse prevention would be in place.  So would
the infrastructure to upgrade to pay-to-play remailers at a later date.

@_subject: More thoughts about digital postage (was Re: Digital postage and remailer abuse) 
People asked in earlier in this thread how remailers could issue digital
postage stamps without being able to know who is using which stamp issued.
One obvious approach is to use blind signatures.  Rather than issuing
a stamp to the user who requests/purchases it, the user could send
an unsigned stamp, encrypted in an RSA envelope, to the remailer.  The
remailer would then blind-sign the envelope and return it to the user.
The user then decrypts the envelope and has a stamp ready for use.
At the time of use, the remailer checks the signature.  If it is valid,
it checks to see if the stamp has been used before.  If so, it forwards
the message to /dev/null; if not, it records the stamp (or perhaps a
hash of the stamp) in its database.
How does the remailer know that it is signing a stamp rather than (say)
money orders, or a confession of sending kiddy porn over the net?  The
textbook answer is to use a cut-and-choose protocol -- which requires
some subsequent communication with the user.  But I'm not convinced that
this is necessary. If the remailer's postage key is used only for
postage and known to be used only for postage, then tricking it into
signing something else would have the same significance as "signing" a
paper check with the Pitney-Bowes postage meter.
I'm assuming that the postage stamp would look something like:

I do not believe that an attack of this nature *can* yield millions of
credit cards -- unless the attacker is Bill Gates or Marc Andreesen
(and they have less risky ways of making lots of money).
The degree to which the attack you describe is a threat to online
commerce depends critically on the degree to which viruses and Trojan
horse programs can propagate through their potential base of platforms. Virii *do* propagate, we know, and someone who reads Cypherpunks surely
has the information on hand to say how well they propagate, given
connectivity on the Internet on the one hand and widespread antivirus
software on the other.  My guess is that overall, the infection rate
even by well-known virii such as Michaelangelo, is pretty low.  Only a
fraction of infected machines are going to be used for buying things
over the Internet.
As for Trojan horses, their penetration depends on how widely used they
are.  If one posted PAMELA ANDERSON STRIP POKER!!!1! to
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica, how many copies would be downloaded and
installed?   How many users would also be online shoppers?
The only way millions of credit cards would be at risk would be if the
Trojan horse were installed on millions of Internet-connected machines
 -- it would have to be a very widely used Trojan horse, something as
widely used as Win95, or Netscape.  I believe that a person who can get
that kind of distribution of their software has less risky and more
fruitful ways of making money than stealing credit card numbers.
In short, I believe that the risk to the credit card business of this

PGP does each encryption seamlessly . . . but in a large list, that's a lot of encryptions to do.  It seem's to me that it would be more efficient simply to:
(1) decrypt the incoming message's IDEA session key using the list
processor's RSA private key;
foreach $listmember (
(2) encrypt that same IDEA session key with listmember's RSA public key;
(3) send listmember the encrypted message and the encrypted IDEA session
This saves one IDEA decryption and N IDEA encryptions of the message. It also saves the need to generate N random session keys, demanding 128N
bits of randomness from randseed.bin .
It means, however, that the list processing software couldn't use PGP, but
has to implement RSA public-key cryptography independently and
compatibly with PGP, so that listmembers could use PGP to encrypt and
decrypt list messages.
(That is, unless the API for PGP 3.0 will be sufficiently robust to
allow fancy session key management like this.)
According to Schneier, RSA is about 100 times slower than IDEA. (He says
it's 100 times slower than DES in software, and DES are about the same
speed.) The faster method still requires N RSA encryptions of the
128-byte session key.  Processing time is cut in half for a message of about 13kbytes' length; longer messages save more, shorter ones less.
And it occurs to me that, since RSA encryptions are commutative, the
list processor could encrypt the session key with the recipient's public
key *before* it decrypted it with its private key, so that the session
key is never available in cleartext to the list processor operator.
(Do pseudopunks write pseudocode? ;-) )

True, and reasonable.
Suppose, though, that the Cypherpunks list was encrypted in this way.
There are about a thousand listmembers.  Using one IDEA key and the
multiple-recipients option would mean that the encrypted message would
consist of a thousand RSA-encrypted session keys followed by the
IDEA-encrypted cyphertext.  If everyone used a 1024-bit-or-longer key
pair, then each message would be a megabyte long!
( (m**P) mod n is going to be log2(n) bits long, right?)
BTW, it was pointed out to me in private email that while vanilla RSA
commutes, the PKCS-compliant RSA in PGP which pads the session key with
random data does not, so that my nifty trick to never expose cleartext
in the list processor wouldn't work.  That's why I'm just a loudmouth
blowhard and not a real cryptographer. ;-)

Howard Gutowitz published and patented in 1992 a symmetric block cipher
algorithm, based on cellular automata, called CA-1.1 .  There are a
couple of CA-based hash algorithms.  CA-based PRNGs have been shown to
be isomorphic to linear feedback shift register RNGs (not linear

I hate saying things like "the answer is to educate the users" because
it is as close to a cop-out as you can get.  But educating the users has
to be at least part of the answer - and not just the users.  The
publicity and shareholder relations offices at Foo Corporation need to
know that putting out information for Wall Street needs to be in a form
that Wall Street can deal with safely.  If Java doesn't belong on the
trading floor, it doesn't belong in a press release either.
I suspect that the best way to get the message across would be for a
major security disaster - a big-time hack or perhaps just a Java-caused system failure - to take place.
(A near-future Wall Street techno-thriller about such a hack *might* do

@_subject: Playing Cards - Caution! 
Note: I haven't read Diaconis's work; just some reports of it in the news
section of SCIENCE more than ten years ago, so people should take what
I say with more than a grain of salt.
In article ,
Thirty-two bits of randomness in a space that is 225 bits wide leave
room for an awful lot of order.
Here is a (surely oversimplified) model of a less-than-perfect riffle
shuffle:  the deck is divided into two equal stacks, and the shuffler
typically introduces some number k of "errors" that result in a pair
of adjacent cards in the shuffled deck being exchanged (compared to a perfectly-shuffled deck).  In a fifty-two-card deck there are fifty-one
possible pairs to exchange.  log2(51) = 5.67, so we get 5.67 bits of entropy for each exchange, if the exchanges are distributed uniformly
through the deck.
How many exchanges are needed to get 32 bits of entropy?  That would
be 32/5.67 , or 5.64 .  In other words, to inject that much entropy into
the deck, only about six shuffling errors need to occur in the shuffle.
The vast remnant of the deck is going to be ordered, in the order that
comes from a perfect shuffle. We would expect to see, as you observe,
most of the cards in the deck alternating suit after one riffle shuffle.
Mathematics does not rely on empirical evidence. ;-)
But bear in mind that Diaconis is a stage magician as well as a statistician,
and surely has a lot of direct personal experience with shuffling cards.
Do bear in mind that, unless you distill its entropy through hashing,
a randomly-ordered deck of cards is going to show a lot of seemingly
non-random properties if you try to use it as a one-time pad.  Most
obviously, because each card in the deck is dealt once and only once,
there must of necessity be correlations between cards dealt early in
the deck and cards dealt later.  (Card-counters at blackjack tables
make their money by exploiting these correlations.)
The randomness of rolling dice is much more easy to interpret than that
of dealt cards.

@_subject: Anti-Bayesian algorithms for Montgolfiering reputation capital 
Reputation capital is becoming increasingly important in the online
community.  A key problem facing new entrants to cyberspace, as well as
the people who deal with them, is how much capital these new entrants
can be said to posess.
A typical solution proposed might be described as "Bayesian", whereby
new entrants to the community are assigned a quantity of reputation
capital that reflects the expectation value of their future reputation
capital.  This is unsatisfactory, because, like all Bayesian statistical
methods, it ultimately relies on the very fallible judgment of the
entities who make such assignments (or that of the implementors of the
automated agents which make such assignments).
It is clear that an effective measure of the initial reputation capital
of new entrants to the online community is greatly to be desired.  It is
felt by the author that anti-Bayesian methods, methods that make no *a
priori* assumptions about the reputations of new entrants, show great
promise as means for achieving this result.
The pioneering work of Parry et al. in the use of test messages to
inspire rapid responses from a community's new entrants.  This method,
which Parry and his colleagues name in their typically colloquial style
as "trolling for newbies", is described in detail in a review article
by Suter (1994).
In this article the author proposes the use of Parry test messages and the
responses generated thereby as a means of rapidly establishing initial
reputation capital for an online community's new entrants.  By
evaluating new entrants' responses to the test messages, messages which
can be carefully designed to virtually guarantee that a useful response
will be elicited. These responses can be reviewed by individuals or
tabulated and evaluated by software agents to estimate the new entrants'
most likely reputation capital without resorting to arbitrary assignment
of an initial value.  Established members of a community may use
existing filtering agents to eliminate Parry test messages and the
responses thereto from their own datastreams; or they may elect to allow
these messages through and review the Parry tests and resulting
responses themselves.
There are indications in the literature that other researchers are at
work on this technology.  For example, messages that resemble Parry
test messages have appeared recently which contain coding very similar
to work of May's (1993, 1994, 1995, 1996) that have generated responses
that are ideally suited for reputation capital establishment from new
community members.
This fertile field for study holds significant promise, and the author
welcomes further developments from any who chooses to work here.

the impending loss of its home on toad.com should be sufficient.
"Proper" naming.  Unless one is anticipating a growth of
alt.cypherpunks.* newsgroups in the future (alt.cypherpunks.flames?
alt.cypherpunks.sources? etc.)  new alt.* newsgroups are better
received if they don't have top-level names.  Using existing top-level
hierarchies is better (e.g. alt.security.cypherpunks or alt.privacy.cypherpunks).  It is best to have a name likely to be
considered well-formed already in mind when one makes the initial proposal, because bickering about naming can distract from the actual
merits of the proposal.
