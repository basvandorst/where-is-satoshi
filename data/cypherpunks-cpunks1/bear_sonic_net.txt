I think that what we really need is some kind of NNTP-like system that distributes encrypted packets instead of cleartext ones.  If you want to baffle traffic analysis, just create a system where they can't tell the difference between your emails and tons and tons of news traffic.  It's not like you could really escape regulation here; if people can't read it, it isn't news.  But you could provide a bunch of encrypted traffic on the same port as any encrypted-
mail distribution or encrypted-web system (a la freedom) during the news distribution - and you could read news without any news hosts anywhere knowing which news you were reading.
Hell, you could even gateway some usenet groups through it if you wanted to give it a kick-start.  And you could have your own groups available only on the crypto grapevine.  They would serve as message mixes, in some cases.  You wouldn't want to follow the classic hierarchical distribution model that usenet uses; that makes any differently-routed traffic stand out.  But NNTP is actually pretty flexible about how messages get passed, and could be deployed in a fractal way as easily as a hierarchical way, at the cost of distribution being a bit slower. With straight NNTP, the overhead of organizational messages would be raised; but it could be made more efficient again using hashes on multiple messages so that different hosts could quickly check for identical lists of posts and quickly discover  any that were missing in either direction.

Yes, different.  alt.anonymous.messages is simply a message mix.  I'm talking about a system that would provide lots of encrypted traffic *ON THE SAME PORTS* as whatever other encrypted traffic you were sending.  IOW, no one should be able to look at logs and say, "well, we can ignore that packet, it's NNTP.  This other packet over here is mail, and probably the thing we're after..."
In a more general statement, I guess I'm saying that encrypted traffic should not be segregated into different services - at least not so you can tell which are which without decrypting. and furthermore, even high-volume ordinary traffic - like rec.pets.cats - should be distributed by encrypted means, so you can't tell at the protocol level what's inside.

@_subject: Fractal geodesic networks 
Yeah, that's where it started.  But I'm using it more in the sense of meaning the properties that fractal structures have; self-similarity across scales, for one, as in the big nodes work the same way as the little nodes and larger patterns are emergent from the interaction of simple rules.  Physically, true.  There is a minimum size feature, in the sense that some computing hardware and memory is required of every node.  In terms of the flow of information, I'm not as sure.
The traffic patterns *ARE* the network.  If the network has fractal traffic patterns, the network is fractal.
Yup.  Mutually exclusive sets of properties. At the lower levels in user-land and very small ISP's, it seems to be hierarchical (eg, I have an "uplink" who connects me to the rest of the Internet, and people who connect through my system treat me as their uplink...).  But at major nodes like big ISP's and server farms, it's more like a distributed or peer-to-peer network (eg, my uplink has several dozen peers, each with independent connections to other points on the internet, and they each maintain independent connections to several different "backbone sites", and the backbone sites are connected both via dedicated links peer-to-peer *and* via all the ISP's that have connections to more than one of the backbone sites
Anyway, once you get up out of hierarchy levels, I think the Internet starts looking a lot more fractal -- self-similarity across scales  in traffic flow, emergent bandwidth and load patterns, etc.

@_subject: This is why a free society is evil.  [Re: This is why HTML email 
Do you posit that people should not be free to file lawsuits?
Why do you regard harassment charges as external?  Basically the goal of a business owner is to have people capable of both producing and working together.  If you have two workers who are both productive but who can't work together (for example, one guy who makes dirty jokes and sends porn movies around, and one woman who takes mighty offense and brings charges against anyone who acts like that) you have to decide which one to get rid of.  As more and more women are in the workforce, the possible cost in productivity from such obnoxious behavior rises; If the company is allowing the guy to be offensive on company time or using company email accounts, they wind up offending a large
part of their workforce.  They stand to lose a lot of other productive employees by keeping one productive jerk on board.
And this is a completely separate issue from the legal liability. The legal liability, again, is not an externality: The company has to allow its resources to be used in this way in order to become liable.  The company could, to be fair, refuse to allow its resources to be used to file the suits -- but that could not stop the suits from being filed on personal time, any more than refusing to allow company resources to be used to spread porn can stop a jerk from spreading porn on personal time.
The personnel commissar is ordering sensitivity training, workshops, etc, specifically to get rid of troublemakers, keep the workplace running smoothly, and enhance the bottom line.  When employees won't work smoothly together, the company suffers.  If the company allows its stuff to be used for obnoxious behavior, the company becomes liable for obnoxious behavior.  These are not externalities, these are just reflections of having a more diverse workforce.  Someone cracking "honky" jokes doesn't cause much of a problem in an all-black workplace.  But if half your workforce is white, One guy cracking those same racist jokes can rip the place apart and destroy productivity.  As business owner, your choice if you want people being productive again is to get rid of half your workforce or get rid of one guy.  The choice is usually easy.
We're seeing the same kind of thing as the proportion of women in the workplace continues to rise.

Note:  I really wish that people would "get" the distinction between socialism and fascism on this list.  I realize both look substantially the same from the libertarian/anarchist perspective in that they involve controlling people.  But they have different ideologies and reasons for controlling people, and to use them interchangeably is to be WRONG slightly more than half the time.  If you want a word you can use for both types of government, plus dictatorships and feudal/aristocratic systems, try "totalitarian".
I have long felt that we could comfortably shrink government if open markets were established to help settle such conflicts. If there are no laws, and both of you are committed to resolving the issue without violence, you probably both put money on the barrelhead to be paid to the other in the event you don't abide by an arbitrator's decision, and then go to an arbitrator and ask his opinion.  That's if you're civic minded, I suppose.  The fact is though, a lot of people wouldn't do that if they thought the arbitrator was likely to side with the other guy. Things become a lot easier if your property deed is a truly *complete* description of the property; in that case you know who owns the volume over the fence (or whether it's held in common) and your neighbor started charging you rent for the encroachment of your tree into his volume years ago.  If you don't want to pay the rent, you have a few choices; you can trim your tree to keep it in your property, you can buy from him the volume over the fence where the tree's limbs are spreading, or you can offer tenancy in common of the volume in question, giving him the right to encroach into the volume near your house too. Note, this assumes sufficient government that property rights and contracts are meaningful.  This is not true in a complete anarchy.
If you don't have at least that, then you and your neighbor will eventually either work things out in some non-specific way or one of you will kill the other.
The closer to anarchy a system gets, the more completely every last thing in it has to be accounted for and owned in order to avoid breakdown.  If it's a residential neighborhood, then it was probably developed by a commercial real estate developer.  In order to improve his bottom line, he will probably retain ownership of certain property rights and sell the rest.  For example, he may retain the sole and exclusive right to build bombs on this property -- and advertise far and wide his intent not to exercise it.  Now the guy with the 55-gallon drum of gelignite is in violation of the developer's property rights and the neighbor calls the developer who sends around some security guys.  This is really just an extension of the kind of "neighborhood association" bullshit that a lot of real estate developers try to do now -- they deny the homeowners the right to paint their houses purple, etc, as a condition of sale.   This puts the property developer in a sort of lawgiver role, but it does not establish a government that can pass arbitrary laws; every right of ownership *NOT* sold to the homeowners would have to be spelled out in the purchase contract, and there wouldn't be grounds for anyone to change those laws after the point of sale.  Basically, you could see right up front what property rights were withheld from you, and what property rights were withheld from your neighbors, when you were contemplating the house purchase decision.  I think this is the ideal of a "functional" anarchy: You are beholden only to the rules and restraints which you personally have freely chosen.  There may be just as many as there are laws in the current setup, but they are there because you personally chose them and they are enforced against you because you voluntarily signed contracts accepting them.
If you bought the house with the understanding that you had no right to build bombs there, and that your neighbors also had no right to build bombs in their houses, and you have a contract with the property developer that says the right to build bombs in your neighbors' houses will *NOT* be granted to your neighbors without your explicit approval, that's fine.  It's a restraint you (and your neighbor) have chosen.  If you wanted to build bombs in your home, you should just have bought a house that was sold with that right intact.  But if you bought your house with "all" property rights and then some twit far away changes the value of your house by changing what property rights you have over it, then  you have a problem.  Currently we allow people to change the sets of rights we own (including property rights) without recompensation -- hell, without even *bidding* for those rights on an open market.  It's very hard.  Probably the best route would be again through property developers; the property developer could retain the exclusive right to sell fire insurance on these buildings, and then license the right *only* to insurance companies who contributed a set percentage of premiums to a local firefighters company.  Getting all these services straightened out is just good business from the property development

And most conflicts are over goods, if you think about them that way.  The tree is property, which encroaches into the volume near a neighbor's house.  Conflict arises because it was never spelled out in the first place who owned that volume.  If it had been, the choices are simpler and less ambiguous: get out of it, buy it, sell it, or charge rent on it.
The factory is property, which encroaches into air quality. Conflicts arise because it was never spelled out in the first place who owned the right to what quality of air.
The factory owner shouldn't be looking at legislation, per se; instead he should have to buy pollution rights on the local market, competing against other factory owners for the relatively small amount of contamination people have agreed to sell.
Et cetera. All of this assumes that there is some means of transfer pricing stuff, some means of enforcing contracts, and a defined, extensive, set of property rights. Total anarchy?  Hell no, it won't work.  Whatever gave you the idea that I thought it would?  What I've been talking about is minimal government.  The interesting question, to me, is what is the SMALLEST amount of government interference required to build a functional society?  I believe that sufficient government to enforce property rights and freely entered contracts is absolutely required.  That is not a total anarchy, and I do not want to live in a total anarchy.  It is however, a minimum possible government -- and looks a lot like what most so-called 'anarchists' mean when they're talking about anarchy.
I also believe that this "minimum possible government" would not
in general build as successful a society as a government that appropriated enough power to make sure that education were available to everybody, and that there was a communication and transportation infrastructure that everybody could use, and which ruthlessly busted monopolies (whether on goods or on labor) into small competing fragments.
To avoid death.
It's different because it's chosen.  If the guy doesn't want to go to an arbitrator, he can choose to go to war with his neighbor, and run the risk of getting killed, either by his neighbor or by his neighbors' friend or family.  In a society with laws and courts, you generally don't have a choice about that.
Huh?  Anarchy *is* the absence of standards(laws) as far as I know.  Arbitration or dispute settlement of some kind has to happen regardless of whether there are standards.  So, in an anarchy, dispute settlement has to happen in an unprincipled way because there are no standards available. Anarchy doesn't prevent this; it directly causes it!  Your point about only idiots going voluntarily into an arbitration not bound by laws is valid, of course, but A, the alternative is probably a shooting war that they are trying to avoid, and B, if we are talking about people who have apparently chosen to live in a society where laws are unavailable, they're probably not too bright anyway.
The arbiter probably doesn't.  If they don't want to comply, they just start shooting.  But see the earlier point about a desire to avoid death.  That's why they'd have come to an arbiter in the
first place.  Failure to abide by the decision would subtantially increase risk of getting killed.  Being in violation of an arbitration would probably substantially increase your risk of going unavenged if you got killed, too, while increasing the risk of a vengeance killing against you in the event that you won the shooting war.

Just an observation, but most of the specific causes of this crisis point strongly to one general cause -- ie, there are too many people in California.  More than the local water supply can handle.  More than power can be generated for locally (unless someone builds a nuke powerplant, and you can already hear the Nimby's screaming...). More than food can be grown for without exhausting water tables to irrigate the central valley.  Another general cause is that most of the current houses are built stupid.  In the 1940's and 1950's houses were built that were quite habitable without constant airconditioning.  They had basement windows where air could be drawn in and air was cooled in the basement with  scads of thermal contact with the cool earth.  There were open airways that circulated air drawn up from the basement through the first and second floor, and windows in the second floor where heated air was allowed to escape.  Many of them were made of adobe or other materials with great thermal inertia, which mediated the extremes of temperature.  All of these are perfectly sound thermodynamic principles, which have been abandoned because wood-frame concrete slab houses are cheaper to build and home buyers haven't been thinking about the cost of cooling the damn things as part of the purchase price.  If building codes were modified, or if contractors and developers  had to bear the first ten years of utility costs out of house prices, we'd probably see a substantial reduction in the so-called "need" for power.

If somebody designs a good set of command-line programs, which produce output usable by each other so that they can be piped together in useful ways on a unix command line, then protocols should be easy to implement as shell scripts.  But a proper building block would have to be scriptable from the word "go." You'd have to fix it so that anything it could do, at all, it could do "in a straight run".  A command line, a command file, whatever. And you'd have to do it so your keys didn't wind up in unencrypted batch files.  Maybe a reference to keys' locations in an encrypted file system would be what went on the command line. Such energy as has been focused on protocols has been at the level of applications -- basically fixing them in source code so the users can't as easily pick them apart and stick them back together again different.

I can see crypto helping keep things between the clients and the servers with an asymmetric encryption scheme; somebody would provide the server's public key when logging on, the server would use their public keys to send them stuff, and nobody could suss out the network packets.  Of course, people could still just run clients if they wanted to know what folk were saying, but with crypto they couldn't packetsniff to backtrack to the source very easily.

So the question becomes, how difficult is it for someone to set up an IRC hub?  The answer is not very.  I've got the software on my SuSE box -- I shut it down when I was starting to harden it, but when I first connected it to the net it was ready to function as an IRC host -- and if I'd typed the names of other IRC hosts into a config file it would cheerily have acted as an IRC hub.  The old-style IRCies are going to need to set up a few new hubs, but I don't think this is going to kick them off the network entirely. It's just going to create a new IRC-like protocol and convert some existing IRC nodes to run it.  The danger of course is that programmers are going to abandon "normal" IRC protocol.  If they quit developing new software for IRC hosting and linking, or if the software for the new protocol is substantially easier to use and slicker, then people who make Linux distros are going to quit packaging old-style IRC hosts, people who keep download sites will take them down and put up "the new version", etc.
Ugh.  I think that's where this plan is pointing.
I anticipate that if IRC and/or Usenet are "fixed", then there will be a much stronger motive for people at large to create analogous protocols to IRC and NNTP with encryption and strong guarantees of privacy.  But they're going to have to be pure peer-to-peer protocols, so there is no "server backbone" that concentrates power in a few coercable hands.  Fortunately, I think the connectivity model is robust enough now -- it wasn't, back when NNTP was created -- to go fully peer-to-peer on netnews transfer.
Hmmm.  There may even be a niche in this new ecology for a network standards body composed completely of pseudonymous individuals, to help create and standardize network protocols for the underside of the net.

First, I think the people who've spoken about document escrow are right.  A much safer approach than key escrow.  But I'm going to talk about key escrow, because there *are* decent ways to do it.
There are methods for key escrow that don't involve a single trusted party having all the keys.  For example, you can generate a dozen random strings of bits, XOR them together, then XOR the result with your key.  Take the result of that operation and it's your thirteenth string.  Now you can hand the thirteen strings out to thirteen different people.  Now if you get hit by a bus, or if they are *ALL* ready to subvert the protocol by working together, they can get together, XOR all the strings together, and produce your key.  A reasonable protocol for a company with fourteen board members, perhaps.  There would be no way to serve thirteen out of fourteen board members with subpeonas and still have the investigation of the fourteenth board member be a secret to the company.
Third, there are methods for key escrow with a single escrow agent that don't allow the escrow agent access to the key while it's still live.  Take your August key on August First, and use a digital timelock to put one solid month of computing between the company escrow officer and the key.  Hand the escrow officer the resulting blob, and use your key with impunity until August 30.  On the 30th, you encrypt everything with your September key.  On September 1, if she's put the fastest available machine to work on it the whole time, the escrow agent gets your August Key.  Now, if you get hit by a bus during august, the escrow officer will be able to get stuff from your drive after august -- but will never have your key while that key is still in use. Fourth, the trusted third party doesn't need access to your keys.  I could set up a web service that generated complementary asymmetric key pairs and published them thirty days apart.  Now when Alice wants to put her key in storage for the company escrow officer, she can come to my site, pick up the key of the day, encrypt her key with it, and hand it to Bob the escrow officer.  If Bob needed to use the key, and it were more than a month later, he could come to my site and get the complementary key and decrypt Alice's key. With this setup, I'm the only one that knows the decryption key, and I don't know diddley about what's encrypted under it or where anything encrypted under it is stored.

Most of these folks have a perception that they've been locked out of doing well -- if your parents couldn't afford a good school, or if they can't afford *any* school and you put yourself through, it colors your opportunities for at least the first six or eight years of your professional career.  If your money went to support parents who didn't have anything saved for retirement, you automatically don't have as much saved for your own retirement.  If you start out with no wealth, then the guy born to wealthy parents, or with wealthy connections from the posh private school he went to, who bankroll his business startup, is taking an advantage you never had.  I think a lot of people resenting those who've done well is actually resenting people who had opportunities - provided through no merit of their own - that were denied to them.  If you're going to think in terms of "doing well," in terms of skill and dedication and saving and investment making you into one of the upper upper-crust in this culture, you aren't thinking of individuals, really.  You really have to think of several *generations* of a family building and passing on wealth and opportunity to the next generation.  It works for individuals too, but it's much harder to do and in a single lifetime the odds against rising from an illiterate family with no savings to being one of the super-rich are negligible no matter how good you are.

These are real opportunities, though most of them aren't of the magnitude that fate granted to Bill Gates and his ilk.  I'm on track to retire comfortably -- at my current pace, if I can hold it, I will be a millionaire within the next five years.  But I'm 37 years old and it has taken me this long to overcome where I started. If public schools and state-sponsored scholarships are removed, I don't like to think of where I'd have been. I think it's not unreasonable that a certain amount of public money should go to opportunities -- schools and scholarships especially -- because these are investments that taxes pay back.  If you make loans to individuals, some get paid back and some don't.  The ones that get paid back, could have paid a hell of a lot more, and the ones that don't are worse off than when they started.  But if you make "loans" to populations, in the form of supporting schools and scholarships, the increased ability of that population to earn, and subsequent tax revenues, *do* pay it all back, and then some.  I hope we find a way to make such things into palatable business propositions and privatize them; I'd hate to see them die with governments.

In a densely built area, the government is exercising the PRESUMED property rights of my neighbors to minimize the risk to their homes from fires I may start. But it has done so, in most cases, without ever consulting my neighbors or getting their authorization for such action. I really wish that property ownership, or whatever else, came with an attached list of the supposed "property rights" exercised on your behalf by government.

It also limits the ability of Pipenet to scale.  Basically, the more
people you get, the longer the time periods become (because every node has to send every other node a packet, and it takes longer to receive a million packets than it takes to receive a dozen).  Once you are down to being able to send only one packet per hour to any particular place, you are effectively scrod as far as getting anything done.  Routing through other pipenet nodes is possible, of course, but all the net sources and sinks of data would quickly either overload with queued packets, or be forced to inundate the whole system with nulls on a very regular basis.  I've been looking at a mode where nodes are considered "located" relative to each other in some kind of fake coordinate space - not necessarily correlated with physical location.  Once you introduce a coordinate space, you can use concepts of direction to help route things.  Break up the coordinate plane with a compass rose into sixteen semi-octants, and each round, you transmit to your nearest neighbor in each octant and also to randomly selected ones at medium, long, and very long distance.   That way, you can guarantee that if you're not contacting the intended recipient of a packet you're forwarding this round, you will at the very least be contacting a node that's "closer" to the intended recipient than yourself.  If you consistently route the packet to any node closer than you, without overshooting, it is guaranteed to arrive in a finite number of hops  (overshooting may be feasible in practice, but I haven't been able to prove this property where overshooting is allowed.  However, a limited number of overshoots ought to be okay - that's more effective in
the average case and reverts to the provable case after the allowed overshoots run out. ).
I think it would defeat traffic analysis, because the selection of who sends packets to whom is perfectly random each time, subject to the vagaries of the coordinate space.   The analysts could tell who your closest neighbors were in the coordinate space, and could eventually build up a model of the coordinate space and figure out your coordinates in it - but no other information is revealed by the selection of whom you transmit to each time.  If you wanted to keep the locations fluid, you could hash all the coordinates each night at midnight GMT.

Maybe you have partial keys on some of them (from the "work reduction fields" or whatever on lotus notes for example).

Set up elaborate tracking stuff that tells how many CPU-

Two, it's the governor's brother running for president. (and the governor, conveniently, is in charge of investigations into vote fraud).

Six (hmm, I must be polydactyl), the ballots can continue to come in by mail from overseas for ten days - mostly from places controlled by US armed forces - provided they have postmarks with an appropriate date - and there's no protocol to make sure that postmarks aren't getting backdated.

@_subject: CDR: A secure voting protocol 
Okay, this information is old hat to most folk here - but it seems relevant just now, and if the infrastructure had been in place for this election, it could have saved us a heck of a lot of trouble.
An Election Protocol: Or, a way for people in voting societies to exercise their franchise without stirring themselves to get down to the polls or, for that matter, leaving their computer. 1) Alice the voter creates twenty sets of ballots.  Each set of    ballots contains one ballot each for all the different things    Alice could vote for. ie, if it's a presidential election,     each set would contain:
   a ballot voting for the American Reform Party candidate,
   a ballot voting for the Constitutional Party candidate
   a ballot voting for the Democratic Party candidate,
   a ballot voting for the Green Party candidate,    a ballot voting for the Libertarian Party candidate,    a ballot voting for the Nazi Party candidate,    a ballot voting for the Republican Party candidate,    a ballot voting for the Socialist Party candidate,    a ballot voting for the Whig Party candidate,
   et cetera.
   Each set of ballots also has an identification number, chosen    at random from a number field big enough to make collisions    unlikely.  The identification number is on each ballot, and    is common to all ballots in that set.  For 3 * 10^8 voters,    a 25-digit decimal number should make collisions acceptably    unlikely. 2) Alice now blinds all the ballot sets with different blinding    factors and transmits them to Bob the vote tabulator.  She Also    sends Bob a digitally signed message that says "I'm voting --    Alice". 3) Bob checks the digital signature, checks to make sure he hasn't    already signed a ballot for Alice, picks one of the twenty sets,    and communicates his choice to Alice. 4) Alice responds by sending Bob the blinding factors for the    other nineteen sets of ballots. 5) Bob unblinds the nineteen sets of ballots, making sure that    they all have exactly one ballot per candidate and that each    set uses its own identification number. Satisfied that Alice    is not trying to "pull a fast one", Bob then signs each    ballot in the chosen set of ballots and returns them all to    Alice.  6) Alice unblinds the ballot set while preserving Bob's signature.    She now has a set of ballots signed by Bob. She encrypts the ballot    reflecting her choice with Bob's public key and sends it to Bob
   anonymously. 7) Bob decrypts the ballot, checks his own signature to make sure    it's valid, checks the identification number to make sure no    other ballots from this set have been submitted already, writes    down the identification number to check future ballots against,    and increments his tally for the candidate Alice selected.
8) When the election is over, Bob publishes the ballots and the    signed "I'm voting" messages.  Alice can scan the published    information to make sure that her vote is present and that    the numbers all add up correctly.  Alice can also check to    make sure that there are NOT more ballots than there were    "I'm voting" messages, preventing Bob from stuffing the ballot    box.
The protocol enforces the one vote per voter rule. If Alice tries to obtain more than one set of ballots, Bob will detect it in step 3.
If Alice tries to submit more than one ballot from the same set, Bob will detect it in step 7.
No one other than the voter can tell whom a particular voter voted for. Bob signs the ballots from the selected set under a blinding factor in step 5.  When he later gets the unblinded ballot in step 6, he can check his signature, but cannot correlate it to any particular ballot he's signed. The only person who can prove who Alice voted for is Alice.  She can communicate her  submitted ballot to a third party before Bob publishes the results, and when Bob publishes the ballots the third party can make sure there's a ballot that matches.  Bob is able to generate fake ballots, but he cannot generate signed "I'm voting" messages from eligible voters.  Therefore if he uses fake ballots to try to stuff the ballot box, he will be detected in step 8. One exception to this is if people obtain ballots (giving him "I voted" messages) but do not then complete the protocol by submitting a vote. Bob can then enter a fake ballot without being detected. One fact about this protocol is that even though you cannot prove who anyone voted *for*, you can prove that they did or did not *vote*.  This may or may not be a problem depending on the application. A vulnerability about this protocol is that Alice can transfer her vote if she wants to.  To do this, Alice would unblind her ballots in step 6, and send the whole set to Carol.  Carol could pretend to be Alice in step 7, and check in step 8 to make sure Alice didn't submit one of her own votes (invalidating Carol's purchased vote).  So California Democratic supporters could swap ballots with Nevada Green supporters, enabling the Nevadans to vote Green in California (where it's "safe" to vote for a third party because there isn't a close race between the major parties one of whom they regard as EVIL) while the Californians voted Democratic in Nevada, where they'd stand a better chance of having their vote make a difference in the determination of electoral votes and keeping the EVIL guy out of office. Again, this may or may not be a problem depending on the application - in most voting situations, where there is no electoral college, there would be no motive to exchange ballots.  But selling of ballots is also usually bad for the process, and the US seems to dislike transfer of ballots in general as regards its own elections - so I'm listing this as a vulnerability.

According to current law in all nations (as far as I know), identity is meat.  One person has one identity, and the identity is persistent and lifelong.  All law is based on this assumption. Emerging in this forum and elsewhere is a different assumption, which is that identity is bits.  If an entity has Alice's key, then that entity is Alice.  Alice's person may be a different person this time, but only if Alice's last person was stupid or careless. And in this case Alice is probably better off with a different person anyway.  Your dealings with Alice are still bound by the same guarantees of trust that you've always had with Alice: the laws of mathematics and the steps of the protocols. Alice's reputation and interests are likely to have changed with the change in person, but that's okay. Under the former assumption (Identity as meat) Alice transferring fortune and property to her son meant a change in the identity of the owner, and it was significant.  Under the latter assumption (identity as bits) if she wants her son to now be the owner of all her stuff, she just hands her son the Alice keys and as far as anyone else is concerned nothing has changed.  Alice is still the owner of the property, it's just that Alice now has a different person. Digital personas can be shared among several people, or handed off from one person to the other, without losing their integrity.  This is one of their desirable properties.  They can also be stolen, but so can most things of value.  If your digital persona is the owner of several tons of gold in the form of digital bearer notes, and somebody else steals your digital persona, guess what?  The ownership of those digital bearer notes has not changed.  They are still owned by the same entity.  You're just not that entity's physical person anymore. So if it is important to you that your identity remains "yours", guard your keys and audit your software, because on the net, identity is bits.  If you want to impose an "identity is meat" assumption, you will have to pursue it in the meat world, where that assumption is valid -- thereby abandoning any hope of retaining the benefits of the net environment, such as anonymity
or privacy.

@_subject: CDR: Key-Address correspondence in networks? 
I want to run this idea past some knowledgeable people and see if it looks like a good idea.... In an application which passes encrypted messages from one host to another, it is desirable to have the message differently encrypted at each 'hop' along the way (to defeat traffic analysis).  But, this link-to-link encryption requires keeping track of an enormous number of keys, and that introduces complexity which a cracker could use to get into the system.  Bluntly, after reviewing PKI and x.509 certs, I don't think that there is a sufficient reason to trust that the machine I'm talking to is actually the machine its cert claims it to be.
The proposal is to use longer keys for each machine, and have the IP address of each machine be part of its key.  (or in another network environment, assign it an "address" which happens to *be* its key...)  That way, you can instantly spot at least one class of bogus requests and constrict the possibilities for an attacker.  (ie, "if the key presented does not match the address it's presented for, refuse no matter what DNS or the key database say about the name-to-key correspondence and the name-to-entity correspondence".)  Note, these keys are for asymmetric encryption - probably elliptic-
curve or RSA.  The IP address will be on the public-key side.  The actual packets will be encrypted under a symmetric algorithm, with the key for the packet encrypted under the asymmetric algorithm and transmitted with it. My questions:    1)  Is using a longer key just paranoia in this case, or is there        an actual weakness in constricting the choice of public key
       that makes the private key easier to derive?     2)  Is there a reasonable class of attacks and spoofs that this        protects against?
   3)  If so, does this protection make the system noticeably harder        to break? (ie, does it protect against what would otherwise be        the easiest attacks?)

I think that one of the major problems with PKI is the "binary-ness" of it.  Everything gets shoveled into "acceptable" or "not acceptable" at the end of the process, but I don't think it's appropriate in trust decisions to have stuff shoveled into "acceptable" and "not acceptable" piles at the very beginning. We can't give a numeric score to the degree of trust we place in a CA.  There's no protocol for exchanging information about breaches in trust regarding particular certs, so we can't have a policy for auto-updating our trust model.  If I get a spoofed cert from a CA, and notice it, I ought to be able to downgrade the trust in that CA - without necessarily removing ALL trust in that CA.  Furthermore, my system ought to pass along the news about the spoofed cert, along with the signature that proves it came from that CA, so that other systems can do the same. "Gossip" is really the only way a robust trust model can work. systems have to at least be ABLE to notify and inform one another when there's a breach of trust involving a CA, and different people have to be able to set the threshold for trust at different points.

For a CA, I'd say 1 in 10^7 requests, tops, would be an acceptable rate of getting spoofed.  But if it were for a transaction I was really paranoid about, I might require an error rate of 1 in 10^10 or less. Modulo standard statistical methods regarding sample sizes, of course -- a new CA that's never been spoofed but has only served 10^8 requests, should be regarded as a hell of a lot less reliable than a cert that's gotten spoofed 1000 times out of 10^11 requests, just because of sample sizes and number of significant figures involved.  But my point is we don't even have a protocol for swapping and updating information about CA's reliability rates, so there's no way to even *assess* the reliability of our current CA's.  We just assume that they are trustworthy, and sometimes we are wrong.  They don't actually check much before they issue a cert.  Also, they don't really have a way of revoking their certs, so once they realize they've been spoofed they can't really correct it very easily -- the spoofing site can go on presenting its spoofed cert for a full year in most cases before it expires and if the client doesn't contact the CA's keyserver directly the client will never know.
I agree with you that CA's should be 100 percent trustworthy. Pigs should be able to fly, too.

I have just read his paper on Assassination Politics, at   It seems to me that he has a not-very-realistic view of how laws are interpreted in  courts, and no understanding at all that governments will make new laws or amend old ones as needed to cover new situations. Basically, assassination is illegal, and the courts will interpret the law in whatever way they need to in order to stop assassinations from happening.  There may be  technical arguments against specific "Misprision of Felony" and "conspiracy to commit murder" laws, but if AP results in killings being performed and killers getting paid, a court cannot possibly return a verdict that permits AP to continue.  The choices are therefore "guilty" and "stop it now."  I'd put heavy money on "Guilty", myself. Even if they couldn't find a specific law to charge the operator of an AP server with, or couldn't get a conviction on the laws they'd charged him/her with, they would doubtless issue a court order commanding the operators of the server to cease and desist.
Also, if they couldn't get a conviction according to the law in any particular state on any particular date, the state would instantly follow up the court order by either passing a specific law against it or amending the wording of their existing "conspiracy to commit" law or "Misprision of Felony" laws. In light of his position that AP is legal and his assumption that, if found so, it could possibly remain so for more than a few hours, I'd have to doubt that he's sufficiently aware of how the law works to make the reasonable argument that you suggest.  Unless, of course, it happens to be true.

The thing about money is, there's no property of it that says it takes a lot of people to have a lot of money.  Think about the very early days of Linux, for example.  It would have been worth several million to Bill Gates if Linus Torvalds had just suddenly "disappeared".  Not because Linus was acting like an asshole to countless millions of people, but just because Linus was acting like an asshole to one person who had billions of dollars. And given the anonymity of the proposed assassination market, nobody would have known exactly whom to take revenge on
when Linus got whacked.
This is what free markets do; they reward people who use them efficiently with financial power on a scale that millions of ordinary people can't match even if they all work together.  Now Bill G. has used every market he's ever dealt with efficiently, to increase Microsoft's Market share and shut out all alternatives.  Why do you think he (or people like him) would be any less competent in the use of an assassination market? "displeasure over windows rebooting" has gotten pretty visceral for me at times -- Two years ago, I spent a whole day poking hex codes into a BIOS to try to get back the contents of a crashed windows disk which contained all contacts and records for our company's first round of venture capitalization and our company's first major client.  The stakes were well over a million and a half dollars.  And yes, it was bad information management on our business developer's part, but we were only four guys at the time and didn't have corporate information policy going yet.
You wanna bet, if fifty or eighty people a year find themselves in that position, and fail to get their info back, that at least twenty or thirty of them wouldn't put a grand or more on Bill's head?  I got my files back, so I didn't have to deal with that. But these days I use Linux at home...  I won't even *steal* windows software any more, running it is too much of a risk.

There are certain problems that no other solution for has ever been found.  There has never been a human society that did not kill people.  Even countries that don't execute criminals still slaughter enemy soldiers and civilians when they go to war. You can regard killing, of certain types of people anyway, as a service industry.  Like all services, less of it is provided (and at a much higher cost) if there is a monopoly on it.  Since we tend to like a minimum of killing, but are willing to pay the high costs for the truly necessary amount of killing, humans have mostly seen fit to institute monopolies on killing, regulate them fairly tightly, and refer to them as governments. In a governed state, it is your civic duty to uphold the monopoly. You must refrain from doing the killing yourself unless the power to kill delegated to the government is redelegated to you by the government.  In an ungoverned state, it is your civic duty to stop psychopaths and sociopaths yourself, since you've no government to delegate that duty to in the first place.  And to do so, generally you must kill.
The "Needs Killing" verbiage you see here, I think, is mostly from people who, correctly or not, tend to think in terms either of there not being any governments, or in terms of the government being so ineffective that they are effectively in an ungoverned state.

My point is that people HAVE TO kill people.  The presence or absence of a government has no bearing on that fact, only on how it is done,  by whom, and how often.  There are certain people who, if not removed from society, will terrorize populations and cause huge amounts of economic and other damage.  In places where there are laws, they are called "criminals".  In populations that can afford to build prisons, and which work together (whether working together is accomplished by government coercion or voluntary cooperation) enough to build prisons and courts, we don't have to kill them as often because there is another method for removing them from society available.
And war killing isn't the same as self-defence, either.  In the absence of laws, killing is just killing.  It is law that designates some killings as murders, others as executions, others as self-defense, others as duty.  But I really don't care what anybody calls it.  I'm just pointing out that some killing is evidently (judging by history) necessary in every culture.
Believe whatever you want.  A sorry waste of living tissue made headlines here the other day by being found with a woman's breast in his pocket.  On searching, the police officers discovered several corpses in various states of hacked-to-bits-ness, all showing evidence of having been raped violently and tortured before being killed.  All of the victims were people whose history did not connect to the killer in any way -- he didn't even know them, and he did this.
If I didn't have police, courts, and prisons available, and such an individual came to my attention, I would regard it as my civic duty to personally remove such an individual from the gene pool, and I would not hesitate to chamber the round and pull the trigger.
Moreover, I would regard anyone who didn't feel the same way as a coward to be shunned.  So, I'm bigoted for feeling this way?  Fine.  You use your words, I'll use mine.  It is an act of cowardice, and destructive to society at large, to permit such individuals to live.
Right now, we use governments to regulate that kind of force -- it's a protocol, to see that it is applied consistently and with due process, rather than at whim and as a result of poor judgement. And, despite a few spectacular failures, it works most of the time.
I participate in the Government protocol because I like for there to be some accountability regarding killings and other uses of force.  But in the absence of the opportunity to use government in this way, I would have to carry out killings and other uses of force myself.  And so would a lot of other people, including some whose judgement does not agree with mine or yours nor with what we now get through government.  AP is a proposed replacement for the "government protocol" -- Its proponents claim that we can cut down on killing in general by trading war, genocide, etc for a relatively smaller number of paid assassinations.  This is interesting, of course, but there is no evidence for the claim.  I believe that it would have the very bad side effect of making it impossible for anyone to amass substantial capital, simply because having substantial capital means you or your property or employees interacts with, and pisses off, more people.  So anybody who was rich enough to get much of anything done would become a target.  Then you'd never get bridges or skyscrapers or large-scale data switch centers built.  That makes AP a colossally bad idea, regardless of whether it would result in more or less killing.

Speaking as someone who has very recently read AP, the protocol presented therein is incomplete.
I'm collecting protocols, trying to write a reference work of them, and, well, I'm most of the way through the A's so the other day I looked at Assassination Politics again. Since this time I was trying to distill a formal protocol specification, I was a lot more critical about fine points.
Bell handwaved on the point of obtaining digital cash for paying the assassin with.  Bob the broker can go to the
bank and obtain it in the usual way, of course - but then has to transfer it to Alice the assassin, and there's a sticky point involved.  If he just "copies" the money to Alice, she can double-spend with impunity and it's Bob's identity that will be revealed. Conversely, if she provides tokens for the bank to sign, then Bob has a major problem getting them past the cut-and-
choose protocol at the bank.  Even if she provides enough tokens to completely populate the cut-and-choose protocol, those tokens still have to have splits of valid identification information for somebody in them - and giving them all to Bob so that Bob could complete the protocol with the bank - would imply that Bob is privy to that information.  Worse, the bank will have the information from the cuts it didn't choose, and has to make sure it all matches. Thus, Bob the Broker and Dave the Banker can identify Alice - or at the very least someone whose identification Alice has stolen.  Finally, Carol the contributor has to have a way to check the digital cash that was sent Alice - to make sure Bob is not holding out her contribution. This works if Carol's original coinage is simply encrypted under the key that the successful predictor used - because Carol can perform the same computation and make sure that bit string appears in the "payment" package.  But then Carol has the same problem where Alice can double-spend with impunity and it's Carol's identity that will be revealed.  On the other hand, if Carol's digital cash is transferred to Bob by protocol, there's no way she can recognize it later under encryption.  (and under commercial digital cash protocols now in use, no way Bob can retransfer it to Carol).  So if Bob deposits the money and obtains new digital cash, Carol needs a way to look at that digital cash and know that it does in fact carry the bank's signatures for the proper amounts - she can't recognize her own bills, but she can check that the total is correct from the last point at which she could.  But Carol has to be provided this information without providing her enough information to just spend the cash herself.  In short, AP as described by Bell appears to depend on digital cash having some exotic and not-otherwise-very-
useful properties, including a bank with a protocol that allows issue-by-proxy, which has no readily apparent commercial use. No protocol for digital cash that I'm yet aware of has these properties.  Hence, without some major engineering work, and probably the active cooperation of some bank, AP as described cannot be implemented.
I think some of these problems could be solved by engineering; but A, it would be non-trivial work, and B, I don't think I care to waste any effort on figuring out secure ways to kill people outside the law.

Yep.  This is pretty much my opinion about the whole assassination thing; if an anonymous market for assassination existed, people would be likely to use it the way the traditional assassination markets are used; Governments to eliminate dissidents, major corporations to eliminate competitors with better products and innovators with ideas that threaten major markets, and the sheeple to get rid of the people their spouses were sleeping with (or maybe their spouses).  Millionaire brats would use it to accellerate their inheritances, rogue cops would use it to destroy people whom they were unable to get quality evidence on, etc...  Bell's idea that government would feel the lash more deeply than anyone else is plain nuts IMO.

Typically in the US, a college has entrance exams.  If you can pay the tuition and pass the entrance exam, they don't care where or even whether you got your primary and secondary education. There's even a recognized class of "jailhouse lawyers" -- people who got arrested, studied the law on their own while in jail in order to handle their own appeals pro se, and who, when finally released from jail, found that they knew enough law to pass the entrance exams for law school and went on to become attorneys.  "Social" or "Moral" lessons are considered to be reflected in performance only, and training is quite irrelevant to them.  If a jailhouse lawyer takes a bribe or wilfully conceals evidence from disclosure or whatever, and the bar association discovers the fact, then she'll be disbarred the same as anybody else, but until something like that happens, she's assumed equal.  The interesting bit is that the relative quality of public and private schools varies a whole lot. In sunny California, which has been neglecting its public school system, all the quality colleges are private and the entrance exams for them are all really tough -- students who've gone to a mere public school are unlikely to be able to get in. The curriculums are fairly mild, but since the graduates are all people who were bright enough to get in in the first place, they retain it well and function well in the world.  If you don't do well enough in high school to qualify for the private colleges, you have to go the inferior public-college route.
By contrast, in states like Kansas, which have a strong tradition of public schooling, the huge public universities have "warm body" admissions.  This means anyone who can pass a GED exam or who has graduated from any public or private high school is automatically accepted -- but the curriculum is some of the toughest in the world and if you're unprepared you flunk out (Along with three quarters or more of your class). In the midwest, the graduates are the ones who were bright enough to *NOT FLUNK OUT*, and they retain their education well and function well in the world. If you can't cut it in the intensely competitive universities, then you have to pull out and go to an inferior private college instead.

Isn't that a misnomer though?  If randomness is reinjected to prevent the system from falling into a period, then it won't be possible to generate the same sequence of bits twice -- so you can't use such a system for a PSEUDO-random generator, in applications like a stream cipher or whatever.  Programs rely on the same sequence coming out of the same initial state with a PRNG -- otherwise things like stream ciphers can't be decrypted.

Here's an interesting idea for a service... since most folks are agreed that spammers won't do encryption, does it not make sense to have spam-free email accounts on some server somewhere? You can do this pretty simply -- all non-encrypted messages are forwarded to dev/null.  If the user wants to, she could use a procmail script that sends a bounce message -- or a procmail script that doesn't. If you're worried about spammers using the service to send mail, you can just adopt the same policy for outgoing messages. So you could have an address where it was enforced that nobody could contact you there without encrypting the message, and then you wouldn't have to worry about carnivores sniffing something sensitive, or about server logs giving snoops your mail, or etc. And as a side benefit, you'd get zero spam -- at least until the spammers ran out of people they could spam more easily.
I think I like this idea, because it would elevate encrypted email from an abberation to be tracked to the universal condition, at least for that system -- and introduce a reason for people out there to *learn* to use crypto software, if they wanted to talk to people on the system.

You don't even have to have a human look at it; a simple program to count character distributions, character contacts, and line lengths can identify something as being the legitimate output of PGP, or whatever encryption program, with a margin of error so flat it's only theoretical.
It would need to make a "profile" for PGP, another one for GPG, etc -- then look at incoming messages to see if they match the I mean, yeah, people could theoretically get stuff past it, or it could theoretically bounce encrypted messages --  but people can also theoretically guess a 128-bit encryption key on the first try, and I wouldn't expect that to happen.

No, it's not.  Every natural language has a detectable frequency distribution and contacts.  *ALMOST* every cipher does not. Someone could be writing martian using the cyrillic alphabet, and you could still look at it and say "this character occurs seven times as often as average and is never followed by that character. This other character is preceded by the same character fully half the time it appears.  And over here we have a set of characters one of which *always* follows any appearance of any member of this other set of characters (which is a constant in almost all languages with plosive consonants -- the only thing that normally follows a plosive consonant is a vowel...) You don't have to know what it says or what language it is.  Plaintext looks like plaintext, and by the time you have more than 50 characters the probability curve of mistaking it for anything else is flat as a goddamn strap.
Did I say someone else couldn't set up a crypto-only mailer using DES and AES?  You always get to dictate 'standards' for systems you own.  I always get to dictate standards for systems I own.  And the government rightfully gets to dictate standards for systems it owns. Sometimes it tries to do more than is rightful, but that is another question. Uh, now who's trying to impose a standard?  You want a system that _someone_else_ runs to conform to _your_ ideas of what it ought to do.  You get to dictate standards on systems _YOU_ own -- not on  anyone else's.

Reflections on AES and DES....  DES was developed by a team that wanted to call it "Dataseal" at IBM.  Some IBM flacks renamed it Demon (for "demonstration cipher"), a name the original developers didn't like.  So they agitated against the new name, and eventually someone decided to rename it Lucifer, which the original developers liked even less.  One gets the impression that the flacks were just toying with the techies here, twisting the knife as it were.
But then it was adopted (in a slightly different form) as the Data Encryption Standard of the US government, and everybody gave up on the "demonic" naming conventions and just started calling it DES.  Now, Dataseal/Demon/Lucifer was pretty good.  It may not have been the *most* secure algorithm of its time, but neither was it a transparent and useless "cipher" with obvious flaws other than the 56-bit keyspace.  However, the important part of building up trust (or lack thereof) in the cipher came after it was chosen as the DES. That choice focused every cryptanalyst in the world on it, for a while, and sparked a fair amount of hard research in mathematics.  Eventually someone found an attack better than brute force on it -- but the attack requires a very very large number of plaintext/ciphertext pairs to carry out, and seems unlikely in practice.  The important thing though, is that people did the math, did the research, did the hard thinking -- and did it for a long time.  When someone uses DES or 3DES today, she knows EXACTLY how much protection her data is getting, and knows that hundreds, possibly thousands, of brilliant people have focused many man-years on proving that that amount of protection *is* exactly how much she's It may be that some other ciphers that were around at that time are more secure -- hell, no doubt about it really.  But none of those ciphers have attracted the attention of as many really bright people making *sure* it's secure that being the DES has gotten for this cipher. Now, the newly minted AES is standing in place to receive the same attention from the worldwide community -- indeed, has already started to.  Even if it's not technically as secure as Twofish and Serpent, the coming years of attention are going to reduce the likelihood of an attack that we just didn't know about on AES -- but not as much on Twofish and Serpent.  So whatever its respective strength, our *knowledge* of its strength will become stronger and stronger as more and more time goes by with attention focused on it.  Anyway, from the POV of confidence in a cipher, it's not really as important which cipher they picked.  It's important that they picked one -- and now cryptanalytic attention is focused on it.
Every day no flaw is found raises our confidence that there is none, making the security of this cipher more trustworthy.  Regardless of its strength relative to the other candidates (which in reality we may never know except by the continued failure to find obvious breaks in anything) the trustworthiness of the cipher, deriving from the amount of effort and testing that have gone into it, will quickly eclipse the trustworthiness of all other candidates. It would have been the same whichever cipher they picked.

True enough.  I have little trust for them though; they have been very irritating to american companies who want to make stuff with strong ciphers, at least for export. No, I wouldn't.  I remember it too, and in fact I was one of the conspiracy theorists at that time.  As time went on, though, and nobody *outside* the NSA worked out the supposed backdoor, I became more and more convinced that the inadequate key length was really the only problem.  Switch to independently keyed 3DES, preferably with a half-block shift between encryptions for more diffusion, and that problem goes away. Hardly matters.  The NSA couldn't realistically have expected to exploit linear cryptanalysis on the DES, because it requires them to capture something like (IIRC) 2^48 unique plaintext/ciphertext pairs.  While that could happen on a high-speed link if they monitored it (and the target didn't change keys) for a long time, it doesn't seem too likely for the relatively small bandwidths employed by terrorist, rebel, and other "fringe" organizations.
If that's a backdoor, it's a backdoor that takes a bulldozer to open.  I'm thinking now that they just didn't know about it.
The NSA was very badly burned in public opinion and by conspiracy theorists for their involvement with the DES selection; having learned their lesson, I note that they have definitely taken a much more hands-off role with AES. Of course, this is also consistent with civilian cryptographic know-how having gotten sufficiently better that they no longer have to tell us what a secure cipher Hm.  Our opinions differ.  The NSA has a stated agenda to embed broken ciphers in the infrastructure of the world, in order to preserve their sources of sigint.  In the past, they have been perfectly willing to embed broken ciphers in the infrastructure of the United states (especially US-produced software) in order to further this agenda.  I don't think I'm a full-out NSA-conspiracy theorist any more, but judging strictly from their record,  that is evidently where they are coming from.  They have been acting according to the idea that the sigint from broken ciphers furthers US interests more effectively than having strong ciphers in place.  In the light of Echelon and the Crypto AG fiasco, they may even be right about that.
But I don't think it's reasonable for the entire world to suffer the pain that broken ciphers in the infrastructure costs, for a transitory advantage to one nation.  The best thing the US could do, for its allies, for the world at large, and for global trust right now would be to just plain quit trying to put broken ciphers into the infrastructure of this planet.  This is a direct attack on infrastructure, and ought to be treated in world courts just as seriously as mining shipping lanes or poisoning water supplies.
I hope somebody has realized this.  It would be nice to think that the AES process represents a step in that direction.

This looks like the sort of thing that can be resolved by experiment though; Anybody got enough DSP smarts to put an induction coil next to a laptop monitor and *see* whether they can read the darn thing? Also, it looks like the sort of thing that could be designed around. If someone were building a "secure laptop" they could make a video system and drivers that wrote the bits in a different, randomized order each time, and which only wrote the changed bits.

I don't have a problem with people who manufacture locks.  I have a problem with the people who sell them.  A sign of irrational fear is when the thing that is the *symbol* of security -- in this case the lock, or the cipher, is made very strong -- but used in a way that does not afford good *actual* security.  If the fear of being burgled weren't at least partly irrational, meaning if it were based mostly on experience rather than mostly on fear -- we'd be seeing doors with half-inch thick steel plates in them to provide the same level of security as the medeco lock -- and reinforced concrete walls to provide the same level of security as the door.
Ditto ciphers.  A strong cipher is like that Medeco lock, or even better - but if the "door" is a dumb key management policy, or the key is easily guessable, then what has been gained?  Because what is a lock, really?  It makes it harder to get in *without breaking anything*.  But actual burglars could really care less whether they break some of your stuff -- provided it's stuff they can't steal.  So if actual burglars were as common as the people who sell these fancy locks tend to make out in their sales pitches, most folks would know, from experience, that burglars who break a window or a door are far more common than burglars who pick a lock -- and would be demanding *actual* security, meaning windows, doors and walls made of unbreakable stuff, rather than just *symbolic* security, of a strong lock or a strong cipher. If you want to propose a "Paranoid Encryption Standard", IE, a system for people who actually *DO* expect people to spend several million bucks and hundreds of man-years
and thousands of CPU-years trying to break it, then it's going to have to encompass a hell of a lot more than ciphers.  Start with physical machine security -- put the box in a concrete bunker with armed guards, give it a flat-panel monitor and roll your own drivers and video hardware. Stick a thermite grenade with a photosensitive fuse in the hard drive box. Make a continuous circuit through all the case components, that will detect anybody taking the case off, and blow the HD if the circuit's broken. Do a couple dozen other things along this line, and you'll have the physical security thing covered about as well as your cipher protects the data. But you're not through yet -- you've got the lock and the door, but burglars can still come in through the windows and the walls.  You've got to do some real serious data security as well. First of all, nothing unencrypted is EVER written to the hard drive except a bootstrap loader that prompts for a cipher key.  When it gets the cipher key, it reads and attempts to unencrypt the rest of the boot record.  There is NO swap partition, and no swapping OS is to be used. The system computes a new cipher key every day using a cryptographically strong random number generator, and notifies you of it in a pencil-and-paper cipher that you can solve. (on high-entropy binary data, pencil-and-paper ciphers are actually quite strong)  That's the key you would need to use the following day.  If you don't log on for one day, you will not have the key for the following day, period. Thus, if someone seizes your box and you can hold out for *one* day, the data is GONE. But the burglars can still come in, maybe, through the roof.
So just to make sure of it, put a timer in there that blows the HD if it's ever been more than 24 hours since you were last logged on.  *There's* your paranoid encryption standard.  Use blowfish for the cipher, and the cipher won't be the weakest point.

Um, actually, no.  The attacks we know on Rotor machines assume that the rotors rotate at predictable, constant intervals.  This was true of the Engigma, but not true of some later Rotor machines.  The papertape variation of this system, with every cipher wheel rotating by some varying amount between each letter, won't fall to any rotor attacks we know of until the papertapes have repeated at least twice each.  Even then, it takes some fancy mathematics to figure out *how* to apply the rotor cryptanalysis to the system.
After reading this newer patent, I think it's actually *LESS* secure than the system it purports to replace. I could be wrong here -- I'd like to actually see the diagrams and drawings and my browser doesn't support 'em -- but it looks like the rotations are constant per keystroke with this system, which would make it
fall to rotor cryptanalysis.  The crucial question, the one I can't make out without looking at the diagrams, is whether the mapping of rotations to rotors is different each time.
Here's what I bet: department of the army didn't like the paper tape idea -- too fragile, too vulnerable to wet, required delicate machinery to read that had to be maintained -- and they wanted something a lot more rugged.  So he designed something that ditched the paper tape idea for them. It wasn't as secure, but it was still better than the Hebern-style machines that were likely under consideration as an alternative.

Actually, even that's not quite true.  Carry lookahead guarantees worst-case performance on addition of O(log2 N) where N is the size of the numbers being addded.  However, there is a "shortcut" available, on average, once per 2 bits in the addition where the carry can be determined fully even before carry-lookahead gets there.  These are the "base cases" of carry lookahead, where both operand bits are equal to one, or both operand bits are equal to zero.  You don't need to determine the carry into those places to determine the carry bits out of them.
 This means that you can build hardware, in practice, that does addition in an average case proportional to the log of the distance between (1,1)pairs in the operands.  In the worst case, that's (log2 N) but in the average case it's (Log2 (log2 N)).
The downside of this is that it involves an O((2^N)/N) number of gates, where conventional carry lookahead involves only O(N^2)
number of gates, and that it makes the amount of time required to complete an addition depend on the arguments.  Chip designers generally don't do this, more because of the second reason than the first. :-)  Math, anyone?

Yes, and so could their clients if not doing business with the insurance companies.
Yes.  Hey, I engage in risky behavior three times a week.  I'm in an open relationship with a bisexual.  I weigh nearly 400 pounds, eat lots of starchy and oily foods, and engage in rough sports.  I had a broken foot a few years ago when I dropped a caber on my foot for example. I also go swimming naked in the pacific off the marin coast, where there are occasional sharks and the water is so cold that most normal people go into shock if they try it without a wetsuit.  I could mitigate these risks, but I don't want to.
But whether they're risks I could mitigate or not still has nothing to do with what level of risk is *REAL* in my life. Mitigable or not, these risks are real.  So is the risk of someone who is born with a wonky gene that makes him or her susceptible to cancer.  Why should that person, who has the same level of risk I do, get a substantially better deal
than me?  What financial motive would an insurance company have for offering two people with identical amounts of risk substantially different rates? If I am a bad risk because of a behavior I choose, then I am a bad risk and that affects the odds at which my health should be bet. If Alice is a bad risk because of a genetic predisposition to cancer, then she is a bad risk and that affects the odds at which her health should be bet.
What's the disconnect here?  Why do you think that the *causes* of risk are somehow more important in determining odds than the *fact* of risk?  We have a choice, but so what?  Higher risk is higher risk. Choices have nothing to do with that.  And there's no point in pretending that these "choices" are equally easy for everybody either.  The biggest factor in determining risk for alcoholism is still heredity.  If your parents were alkies, you're probably quite susceptible to it yourself.

You're trolling, aren't you?  Insurance is a good idea for the insured because it takes money to make money.  If you have any investments, any property, etc, which you *rely* on for your livelihood or your lifestyle, insurance is a way of knowing that you will continue to have, and being able to make plans based on having, those items into the future even if a disaster of some type hits.  It's a trifle *MORE* expensive than just paying for the disaster, but it's money where you can budget it because you know when and how much you'll have to pay. Insurance is a good idea for the insurer because the insurer does business with a large enough number of people that paying for the fifteen or twenty actual disasters that happen in a given day can be done routinely out of the fifteen or twenty thousand premium payments received that day, with some money left over for lunch.  As the numbers get larger, the disasters become more predictable.
Nowhere in this business model is there any shred of entitlement or obligation.  The insured is not entitled to coverage.  The insurer is not obligated to write a policy on someone who has risk that makes the policy too cheap for the insurer to make money.

No, the first concern of any and every government is its own survival.  This is true whether or not it is achieved by allowing individual citizens to survive. Caucescu (sp?) and Duvalier the Elder were willing to execute half their respective populations to stay in power, remember?  Extreme examples, but....
*sigh.*  This is probably the last time I'm going to respond in this thread -- its clear that our opinions are too different, and held too firmly on both sides, for a useful discourse to emerge.
However, I'm going to just mention something here.  It is not terribly unreasonable to expect health care to be paid for by someone other than the recipient of said care, even in a free society.  But in a free society, you don't do it by forcing hospitals to treat people they aren't getting paid to treat, and you don't do it by forcing insurers to insure any group of people at rates that won't cover the cost of treatment for that group.  Those methods are an "unconstitutional taking" -- which is what you call theft when the government does it.
In a free society, if you intend to have the government pay for health care, it pretty much has to be paying for *everybody's* health care, and it has to be doing it out of taxes rather than by forcing hospitals or insurance companies to engage in an unprofitable business practices. Picking on hospitals or insurance companies is robbing the few to pay for the needs of the many; the many may like it, but it's a very fundamental infringement. Taxation, on the other hand, is robbing the many to pay for the needs of the many -- inefficient and compulsory, but at least it operates without picking on particular people.
Now, I've used the words, "free society" above.  However, every coin paid in taxes is an erosion of freedom, and we have to recognize that.  When taxation reaches 90%, the people are serfs and nothing more, even if technically free.  However, I'd support government health care, even with the attendent taxation, if it were required to prevent a scheme like the one you propose.  If it could be shown that it resulted in the whole population being substantially healthier for longer, at a lower cost, I'd support it anyway -- to paraphrase Mao, I don't care whether the cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice (not that I think it would, by the way). But, we have to recognize that even if it did result in better cheaper health care in the short run, it would mean changes detrimental to health care in the long run.  For the last 20 years or so, theUS with its private health care system has also been the country that has fueled almost all research into new drugs and treatment techniques.  Basically, everybody who's developed anything has done so because they have their eye on the lucrative American market for health care.  Sure, you have to get past the FDA -- but it still happens.  If we shifted to government-operated health care, the US market wouldn't be a moneymaker anymore, and you'd see a lot less private R&D. Finally, as much as we like talking about what *should* happen or *should not* happen, reality is about what *will* happen, which has only an incidental relationship to either.  What *will* happen, nobody knows for sure.  If Crypto Anarchy becomes the norm, then government involvement in medicine, like government involvement in almost everything, is on the way out and we are left to be prepared and deal with it.  The alternative is pretty horrible to contemplate, because the only way to *prevent* Crypto Anarchy from becoming the norm is probably with an invasive and totalitarian worldwide police state. And of course, that could also happen.

Here is what I envision, at a cost of something like $10/month.
Email accounts that bounce anything not encrypted - either silently or with a message that says "this account accepts only encrypted mail." at the option of the account holder.  These accounts are restricted in some way that makes them unattractive to spammers - probably they are able to send no more than 3 or 4 unencrypted emails a day, maybe they are unable to send *any* unencrypted email.
Web Hosting strictly via HTTPS.  Standard accounts get four or eight kilobytes accessible by http (enough for a redirect), and 100 Megabytes or so of web space accessible by HTTPS. Anonymous accounts.  You send a message with a long random key and a few dozen choices for your login name, and a password to use
(send via a remailer or whatever) and the provider publishes a webpage with listings mapping keys to login names to tell you what login name you've gotten.  The provider holds the name for a couple of weeks.  If during that time the provider recieves payment for an account by that name with a that password (say, by cash or bullion via mail or courier, or any of various ecash systems) then the provider creates an account with login, that balance and that password. The provider also publishes a page of login names in use, so you can check to try to avoid collisions.
To renew your account, your payment must be sent with your login name and the original payment key.
If it can be done legally, the service provider would get a debit card for each account paid more than $200 in advance, and give the card number to the account holder. Then, whatever amount had been prepaid would be available for web purchases, etc. for web merchants with POS stuff.  This is a sticking point, and could cause a lot of trouble if any missteps are made.  In the worst case, 30% of this money would have to be paid to the IRS - to avoid charges of abetting tax evasion while maintaining client anonymity. (technically, this ought to make the money paid for the service tax deductible, but you could only claim it by revealing your True Name along with proof that you'd paid it -- so clients interested in real anonymity would have to bite the bullet and pay taxes on that money twice). Nice anonymizing web proxy with whatever filters you like, returning whatever CGI information you want it to return.  Cookie functioning is selectable by host (so you can, eg, deal with your bank via the proxy if you want).  Web proxy is available only via https -- ie, the link between the proxy and the user is *required* to be encrypted. Anonymous encrypted FTP.

Clearly, there is no such recourse when dealing with a Nym.  And the hellish thing about Nyms is, they don't cost anything.  If the guy (or gal) steals from you using a Nym, you can spread the word about that nym and trash its reputation.  But they don't have to care, because by this time they'll be using another nym.  With Nyms, somebody who has ripped off a hundred people for a million dollars each is indistinguishable from someone who's just new to the system. While Nyms have zero cost, they will never simultaneously be in use and have negative reputation.
It is also very hard to get a positive reputation with a nym; (switching to didactic mode). Either you are doing a legal business or an illegal business.
   If you are doing a Legal business:
   A customer can go to either a nym or a true name.        If a customer goes to a nym, there is no legal recourse,        but if a customer goes to a true name, there is legal recourse.        Therefore it is clearly better for the customer to go to a true        name.

      If a reference is created, then it either does, or does not,       identify the principals and the deal consummated.             If the reference identifies the principals and the deal              then it can also be used as conclusive proof in court
            against them if the owner of either nym is ever discovered.             And this is the best kind of "digital reputation" I can             find in this system.  It will be significant to someone             else who has dealt with one of the principals as an             introduction to the other, but cannot really be useful             beyond that.         deal consummated, then either it does not identify the principals         or it does not identify the deal consummated.             If the reference does not identify the principals in the             deal, then it can be duplicated at will by anyone who             creates a few Nyms and puts them through the paces of a             few pretended deals, and is therefore meaningless.             then it becomes impossible to make judgements based upon             it. -- a cocaine dealer with a million-dollar shipment is             hardly going to accept a "reference" which might be based             on the purchase or sale of a pocketknife.  Such references             are also meaningless.

'scuse me, but this gets a big raspberry.  The tools governments would need to implement such a system are already out there, in droves and gobs.  What ZKS does or does not contribute to that brew has little to do with whether broken security gets rammed down everyone's throats or not. Asking for crypto systems that cannot be used in such plans is a lot like asking for bricks that cannot be used to build unsound structures. Somebody might be able to develop such a brick: but it wouldn't be a general, flexible component, and there'd be so many *sound* structures you couldn't build with it, or had to expend a lot of head-sweat figuring out *how* to build with it, that all the construction workers would hate it and ignore it to death.
I think that crypto tools ought to support whatever the hell crypto operations the people using them want.  Including third party access to keys and the use of monoalphabetic substitution ciphers to encrypt correspondence if they're stupid enough to want that.  There is no foolproof system, and attempting to make foolproof systems only limits the uses to which they can be put by non-fools. Alice cannot give her private info to Bob and then expect Bob not to know it in some other situation; it has passed out of her control and any policy or tool Bob has in place to "maintain privacy" is equally out of Alice's control.  If Bob is trustworthy, there is no need for crypto at all because Bob will religiously *not* look at those records for any unauthorized purposes.  If Bob is untrustworthy, Bob will claim to be using crypto whether or not Bob is actually using it, and claim to have a privacy policy that he follows whether or not he actually does.  Either way, there is no reliable protection for Alice the consumer once she has passed her personal info in the clear to Bob.

Not exactly. They weren't forbidden to learn; however, it was forbidden for anyone (including other slaves) to teach them. It amounts to the same general thing (instruction being unavailable to them) but when a bunch of slaves gathered around Sojourner Truth for lessons in reading, it was her that was breaking the law, not them. Yeah.  And some of them did and some of them didn't.  It's a long damn tradition, unfortunately.  In England, it goes back to the Norman invasion and the way the Saxons were treated; but the Normans were just copying the Romans, and the Romans were just copying the Greeks.  There's a guy who gives Foghorn "concerts" in Golden Gate Park.  He has to wear hearing protection and a padded suit, otherwise it leaves bruises all over his body and he can't hear for a few days.

An interesting point:  There are ancient inscriptions in Wales  that no one has been able to read in modern times.  Deciphering an unknown langauge, not related to known languages, when it is written in an unknown script is a feat of linguistics that transcends mere cryptanalysis and has, so far, rarely or never been done.  And, as language, doubtless it has regular structure, patterns, grammar, and the flexibility of use that people in everyday lives need in speaking - and presumably they're not even encrypted. "Poor Man's Crypto", possibly even better than digital crypto, may consist in creating an artificial language together, and then using it whenever you don't want to be eavesdropped on.

I'm with him, actually, about list content.  I had hoped to find tech discussions going on.  In the interest of making  some news if you don't like the news you're getting, I present -- the Country Mile Cipher.  Algorithm details available (for now) on This is a stream cipher based on the Blum-Blum-Shub pseuodo-
random number generator -- and on work done more recently by Ronald Rivest, who "digitally sealed" a message that he expects to take 30 years of continuous computing to unscramble. The Country Mile Cipher has one interesting property; You can choose when you encrypt a message how much computing power it will require to decrypt it.
This interesting property has two useful applications:  First, you can make it that much more difficult to "brute-force" a key, so even if you are restricted in key length, you can still achieve reasonable security. Second, you can use it to "digitally seal" messages to people that will not unseal without a specified amount of computing time.  I can foresee protocols where someone not having information for a specified length of time after it's delivered would be useful - It could be treated as a "bit commitment scheme" where the person making the commitment does not need to do anything else. Anyway - there's very little here that's my own invention.  The Blum-Blum-Shub Random Number Generator is well-tested, and the mathematics for predicting its state into the future are explained in Schnier's book.  I haven't really done anything except put some well-known and well-tested pieces together, so I'm pretty confident
of the security of the Country Mile Cipher. So confident, in fact, that if anyone can come up with a viable attack on it, I will cheerfully pay the *first* person to do so fifty US dollars.  :-)

Interesting question, actually...  The difference between a "random crazy" and a "freedom fighter" can be awfully dang thin.  I think that in order to qualify as a "freedom fighter" there has to be a significant faction who support your actions and a nonzero chance of bringing about real change.
Mcveigh, as he is, is just a random crazy.  But if, say, one out of ten American Citizens or so had looked up from the news story and gone, "It's about time somebody started fighting those bastards" then he'd have a constituency to whom he could be a freedom fighter.  And also a nonzero chance of causing real change.  Not a bit of difference in his own actions -- but the context in which his actions took place -- and his decision to make exactly those actions in that context -- make him a random nut rather than a freedom fighter.  It's just my opinion.  But that's how I see it.  Freedom fighters do what they do because they have constituency whose interests they are fighting for and a realistic belief that the fight will change something.  I think these were lacking in Mcveigh's case.

My opinion is even more stringent than that.  The archaeological record shows human-like anatomy starting about half a million years ago, but no evidence of symbolic thought or individual experimentation with / invention of tools prior to about the year -38K.  Up to that point, you've just got a few classical tools, made the same way generation after generation after generation, and after that point you've suddenly got cave paintings, tools made out of unfamiliar materials, tools made for new purposes, people buried with grave goods (proof that someone at least thought *something* about death), sculptures of animals and carvings that could not serve as tools (and thus are probably classifiable

Client pays through the nose and software supplier accepts liability for software failure. If you want a software vendor to guarantee anything beyond the occupation of disk space, you're usually looking at five and six digit ($USD) prices for applications.  Since that's not usually a consumer price point, this is called "Enterprise" software to distinguish it from the regular kind.  It also usually comes with a consulting contract so that the supplier can make sure you don't install it wrong (say, having someone without admin priveleges run the installer and then suing for non-performance because it didn't update the registry) or on a "Pseudo-compatible" Operating system (as software written for AIX will sometimes run on Solaris, for example, but may crash at unexpected moments)....
Most Enterprise software is written for Unix boxes.  That which is not written for Unix boxes is written for NT boxes.  Most enterprise software features "failover" capabilities, meaning it runs on a cluster or network of machines instead of a single box and if the particular box you're talking to crashes, your session will be handed off to another in such a way that you never notice. There are also marketing drones who apply the term "Enterprise Software" to whatever ordinary shrink-wrap software they're selling, because they don't know any better.

Recently, I've been making and breaking pencil-and-paper ciphers specifically to acquaint myself with the art of cryptanalysis.  I've developed methods for solving vignere, general transpositions, playfair, etc...  just basically bringing myself up to speed with the general background of the field. And then, with my brain sharpened by the classics, I've been returning to things I formerly thought were "really neat ideas" in crypto but couldn't formulate a good reason for why they would be secure, and demolishing them.  On most of them, the attacks have turned out to be embarassingly simple;  On this one, although I found an attack where known
plaintexts or chosen plaintexts could demolish it, to a cryptanalyst guessing cribs it's pretty resistant (it requires depressingly long cribs of a depressingly specific form unlikely to be found at random).
Anyway, any fans of pencil-and-paper systems out there, enjoy!
(Pencil-and-paper cipher; believed secure against amateur
  pencil-and-paper cryptanalysts but insecure against   computer-assisted or really good pencil-and-paper   cryptanalysts -- falls under the heading of "a cool   idea that didn't hold up under cryptanalysis")
This is a pencil-and-paper cipher, moderately difficult to use and extremely difficult to solve by pencil-and-paper cryptanalysis. I specifically do not assert that it is computationally secure.  The cryptanalysis explaining why not follows at the bottom of this paper. In this cipher, the key is a list of numbers, each number corresponding to one cleartext symbol. The following property must hold true of these numbers.
For some number N, (N=2 in the following example)
One of the two following conditions must hold:
   Either:
   Or:
        in either one of the last two digits.
(In the example, both conditions are true). For some number D, (D=3 in the following example), Each code number must be at least N x D in length.  The cipher provides sufficient confusion to "cover up" runs of identical plaintext characters of length D or smaller -- runs larger than length D will start showing a discernible pattern in the ciphertext. For a key on a small alphabet, consider the following:
A 129754
B 148943
D 208531
E 259146
F 268953
Now, if we are to encrypt the message "DEADBEEF" we would proceed as follows: First, the key number is written lined up beneath each plaintext letter, with N columns of digits for each column of letters; with a leading-difference system, the numbers are written starting in the column of the corresponding letter:  With a trailing-difference system, the numbers are written ending in the column of the corresponding letter. D E A D B E E F         leading difference
     D E A D B E E F    trailing difference
208531  148943
  259146  259146     129754  259146
      208531  268953
Next, the numbers in each column are added, with any carries spilling over to the next column;
208531  148943
  259146  259146
    129754  259146
      208531  268953
------           ------           ------           ------           ------           ------           ------           ------           --------------------
D E A D B E E F                     D E A D B E E F
In a real system, we could have chosen "leading difference" or "trailing difference" and made the key such that it would have been unusable in the other direction. With either mode, we can use code numbers of varying numbers of digits; the requirement of a constant number of digits holds only for systems such as the above which may be solved in either direction.  With a leading-difference system, the correct method is that the numbers be lined up with their leading digits under the letter before the addition is done; with a trailing-difference system, it is important that the numbers be lined up with their trailing digits under the letter before the addition is done. Since the "trailing difference" system need not worry about a carry digit altering the key, more symbols may be included in its alphabet.  I have used N=2 here as the range of sensitivity, thinking of the roman alphabet plus perhaps seventy code signs.  If you prefer a nomenclator-like alphabet of nine thousand code signs, the same technique may be used; you will need to use N=4 instead.  I have also used a "digit overlap" or D of three here, meaning that each digit of the ciphertext is the result of adding three digits in a sum, plus a possible carry digit.  Better security may be had by increasing the digit overlap (the minimum length of each numeric element becomes N times the digit overlap) but real computational security cannot be achieved by this method; it will frustrate only pencil-and-
paper cipherers.
Finally, since the ciphertext is "open at its ends", it is best for security to use a predetermined number of NULL symbols at both ends of the cipher; Null code numbers, unlike the actual key numbers, need not differ from legitimate key numbers in the first or last few digits; they need only to differ in the
first or last few digits from the code numbers assigned to other null symbols.   Leading and trailing NULL symbols make this cipher quite difficult of solution; if you keep track of your supply of leading and trailing nulls and do not reuse them, the cipher is reasonably secure against pen-and-paper A successful method for pen-and-paper analysis, however, does exist.  If a known plaintext enciphered with some key is captured, a cryptanalyst may set up linear equations constraining the values of the code numbers.   If a set of D+1 consecutive symbols is used more than D times in the message under the same key, then the linear equations may be solved and will generally find the code number corresponding to at least one symbol. Once at least a few such code numbers are known, a cryptanalyst may start looking for "cribs" consisting of a seqence of length D consisting of known symbols, one unknown code symbol, and another sequence of D known symbols.  Each time such a crib is found, the cryptanalyst will learn another key code number.
A cryptanalyst may also look for "cribs" consisting of a sequence of length D consisting of known symbols, two unknown symbols, and another sequence of length D of known symbols; each time this happens, he will obtain a linear equation constraining the values of two symbols.  If more than one linear equation is found in this way constraining the value of any two symbols, the key for those symbols can be found.  Then of course, the other symbols captured in the linear equations with them from other cribs may also be solved for. What security this cipher has is as a result of the abstracted and difficult form that a crib must take, and the difficulty of finding and identifying suitable cribs.  *sigh.*  Oh well, it's better than a standard nomenclator or a pigpen cipher.  Polyphony or polyalphabetic code substitution could of course be applied to good effect, but that's just obfuscation.

WRONG!  If data can be displayed by the recipient's computer, then it can be captured.  Wanna bet somebody can't hang a screen-copying utility on their keystroke interrupt and capture the information that way?
While this kind of stunt (actually just leaving those functions out of the GUI) may give people "warm fuzzies", it does not materially add to security, because fundamentally, the user has physical access to his/her own machine and can do whatever he/she wants to on it. And while it's probably good to notice that servers can get compromised and bypass them, does anyone here think routers can't be compromised?  Let's face it, if the bits go from you to the other person over the Internet, there are always going to be lots of places where someone with fingers in the network can get a copy of them. Keeping a copy is not normal behavior for routers, but if someone wants to log traffic at a router they own, they certainly can. As the owner of Disappearing Inc. I can tell you right now that we do not yet have a product in this space and do not have one under development at the current time. We have completed a feasibility study, in the context of a larger product encompassing a lot of different protocols, and that is all.  A product, *IF* we decide to go ahead with one, is still over two years out. It seems odd to see Disappearing Inc's product described in this way since we don't have one. And also provides a central monitoring point that allows SafeMessage to maintain logs of who mailed who and when, and to do a complete traffic analysis of all messages sent with this system. Isn't that And we know, of course, that when the message times out or is delivered, it's erased from the AbsoluteFuture server.  We know it because ... well, actually, we don't.  Unless we extend greater fundamental trust to the AbsoluteFuture server than to the servers we bypass by using it.  There is no protocol for making sure that something is erased. Now, they are probably erasing.  But we can't verify it, any more than we can verify erasing in any cypherpunk remailer. And they have their heads up far enough to attract attention, and they have investors to answer to so they can't just shut down if compromised the way cypherpunk remailers do. So there could be a carnivore already in place on their system for all we know, and they wouldn't be allowed to talk about it. Right.  While this system provides a route outside the normally monitored routes for traffic, it is not a route that can't be monitored.  While it provides a server other than those normally subpeona'd, it is not a server
that can't be subpeona'd.  The only hard security this system can offer,
therefore, is the encryption.  So, if the product can be exported or downloaded from a website, I would have to suspect since it's made in the US that somewhere in the headers or trailers, the message bears a block that contains most of the key (all but the last 40 bits) encrypted in a form the NSA (and whomever else has their key) can read. -- This is the same thing that happened to Netscape after v4.07 for example, and Internet Explorer after v4.  If it can't be exported, that would be a good sign.  Aside from that, I don't know the particulars of the encryption they use - they claim to use a product cipher, but so far I haven't seen what the components of the product cipher are, what the key lengths are, how they do key management, etc etc etc.

Well, after a short conversation with the USPTO's server, I now have an application on file for a trademark which I can use to defend my business' web address.
Unfortunately, after a short discussion with the California Corporation Commission, it appears that I cannot now incorporate under the name "Disappearing Inc" because these guys already did. As it turns out, all the trademark applications they've filed that would interfere with the application I filed are being disputed by the USPTO as being too general -- they are mainly just descriptive words.  So they don't actually have trademarks they could use to kick me off my domain name yet. Anyway -- the way it looks now, there's a decent chance of my application being approved, and if that happens, then it will conflict/interfere with the trademark applications they've filed and those applications will have to be refused.  There is also a chance that the trademark applications they have filed will be approved, and if that happens then mine will be refused as it will be found in conflict with theirs. And the wheels grind on....

Nope, he's got it right.  There used to be, officially, a 40-bit key length limit on exportable software.  This made american software products with any crypto capacity ridiculously weak, to the point where anyone concerned about security would not use it -- the software industry was losing to foreign competition, and the quality of the intercepts was going down because everybody was wise to it and nobody who mattered to them was using it anymore. New policy:  The BXA approves export licenses for people who put all but the last 40 bits of the key in the headers or trailers somewhere, encrypted under a key that the NSA doubtless knows.  Not that this is noised about too much.  Feature AOL saying "yes, we broke the encryption in Netscape starting after version 4.07..." not bloody likely.  After a little security skirmish with my (now Ex)Bank, I discovered this about Netscape and Internet Explorer; both have "help fields" in their headers that facilitate cryptanalysis of SSL connections if you have the key to the help field.  As far as I know, the same is true of all software that has BXA approval for downloadable status.  At least (name deleted -- a friend who works at netscape) confirmed that they couldn't get BXA approval for export, OR get anyone at BXA to tell them why not, except for vague wailing about "security considerations" until someone finally offered to put in a "help field".  Anyway; people concerned about security from ordinary theives can now be reassured because only the US gov't gets the juicy bits, and the Uber-theives at the US gov't are reassured because they are getting the juicy bits again now that most people think US products have "strong" Don't get me started on this; I get so mad I can't see straight.

@_subject: CDR: PACKRAT development plan: Comments? 
Okay, it's a long message.  I've been thinking about/working on this, in my spare moments, and I think I have a viable project here.  I'd like to ask people to look this over and help me fill in the important bits I've doubtless missed.  Also, general feedback would be appreciated -- Is it useful?  Is it needed?  can any of these functions be safely "offloaded" to other          PACKRAT Development Plan  (Protocol Advisor and Cryptographic Key Retention
  and Administration Tool - 'Cause I'll go a mile   for a good acronym. :-P )
When completed, PACKRAT should provide a
framework within which "Drop-in" modules will be
able to work together to perform various tasks
security. The first kind of Drop-ins are Crypto Modules,
which provide encryption and decryption services,
(or hash functions or signatures), key generation,
and a huge wealth of information about the
characteristics of the keys and ciphertexts and the
efficacy of various cryptanalytic attacks on the
ciphers. A second kind of Drop-In is a pseudorandom
number generator or random number generator.
Aside from supplying random or pseudo-random
bits, These modules are expected to supply a wealth
of information about the characteristics of the
streams they generate and the efficacy of the best
known cryptanalytic attacks. Another kind of Drop-In is a Cryptanalytic Module,
which automates as far as possible a cryptanalytic
attack against ciphers produced by particular
Programs (including Crypto Modules, RNG's, and
PRNG's). This is needed to keep the designers of
Crypto Modules honest, but strictly speaking, these
are optional to the operation of PACKRAT. A fourth kind of Drop-In is a Protocol Script. A
Protocol Script specifies the steps involved in
carrying out some protocol -- it will call for ciphers
and/or (P)RNG's having particular characteristics,
which PACKRAT will then select from among the
crypto modules on the basis of information
provided by the crypto modules and also on the
basis of information about the other participants in
the protocol. PACKRAT sits on all these drop-ins, keeping a
database of the ciphers, RNG's, PRNG's, keys,
messages, identities, nyms, and cryptanalytic
capabilities available to it. Each drop-in must be
digitally signed, and PACKRAT will check these
signatures. It will also keep addendums to its list of
keys, correlated with notes about what each key has
been used for. The user ought to be able to see a list
of what information would be compromised by the
loss of any particular key. This necessitates a Logging function and assures that
the application must allow logfiles to be kept. These
logfiles must of course be encrypted if they exist,
and people must be able to erase them, select what
level of logging (and therefore correlation/ introspection/ compromise reporting services) they want. Also, PACKRAT must support a "log management"
function that ages logged records, deleting old
information according to the user's policy. The author of any PACKRAT Plug-In may issue a
decertification/insecurity notice, digitally signed.
PACKRAT, on recieving such a notice, will check
the signature and if it matches, warn the user about
the changed security estimates on past protocols
(producing logs of possible compromises with
appropriate references to old logfiles and drawing
the user's attention to them). It will also check the
security of protocols now in progress, halting such
protocols if the revised security level is unacceptable
to the user. Decertification notices against particular plugins
may also be issued by other parties, but then it
becomes a trust issue. Since it would be easy to
mount a denial-of-service by issuing decertification
notices against secure modules, such decertification
notices must be backed up by cryptanalytic
Drop-Ins. PACKRAT will initially respond
according to its trust models for the issuer of the
Decertification and the issuer of the affected module

Not directly I can't, at least not without betraying someone.
In retrospect, I should've used a nym to make the statement to keep him out of trouble.
Okay, let's forget what I know from people I don't want to drag into the fire and go through it from the "circumstantial" angle.
What does it mean when Lotus Notes has to put a work reduction field in their product in order to get export approval status, and then doesn't talk about it?  But lots of other companies who also don't talk about it, with stronger-seeming crypto get export approval status? What does it mean when banks refuse to work with earlier versions of Netscape claiming it's because the security certs are expired -- but when new security certs are downloaded and installed, they still refuse to work with earlier versions of netscape and refuse to tell you why? (This, btw, was what made me suspicious in the first place and why I started digging...)
What does it mean when Lew Giles, even after the rules change to the BXA-controlled system, made a living going around convincing engineers working for american companies to compromise their products'  security? With or without knowledge of the companies' execs?
What does it mean when PGP has a "flaw" introduced into its Additional Decryption Keys at the same time NAI is seeking export approval for it?  And NAI gets export approval, and then nobody notices the flaw for several years after, and then they go oops, it was just a mistake?
What does it mean when a CEO who actually can and does review code, so subverted engineers can't seem to get one past him, in a meeting with NSA officials refuses to compromise -- and one of the spooks loses his cool and offers to run the guy over in the parking lot?  I'll explain this one to you...  it means that spook _HAD_NEVER_SEEN_ anyone refuse to compromise, and had no fucking clue what to do.  That's if you buy the "he just lost his cool" story.  On the other hand, death threats may be policy and this was just the first time they were needed.  And on the gripping hand, maybe it's just the first time it was *reported*.  Not very many execs would talk about something like that, and I figure most who've experienced it probably just shut up and gave the spooks whatever they wanted.
Lew Giles and its ilk had to have some kind of bargaining position, and if export approval was forthcoming without subverting security in some way, would have had none.  The only way a spook could lose his cool and offer Bidzos a death threat would be if that spook were totally unfamiliar with people not compromising.  You may consider me paranoid, but I'm telling you that the case of Lotus Notes was just the one that people found out about.  If Lotus had to do that to get export approval from the BXA, then so did everybody else. I do not buy the story that what happened to PGP was an accident; on the contrary, it was just NAI doing what they had to do to get approval to put it up for international downloads, the same as Lotus just did what it had to do.  And, I'm telling you now, the same as AOL and Microsoft did what they had to do with the browsers.

I call such incompliance evolutionary pressure.  Let us hope that you are not really such a complete nincompoop as to get into the middle of a 200-mile diameter stretch of desert without having provided for your own sustenance or transport the hell out of there.  Freedom entails not just the right, but the *RESPONSIBILITY*, to take care of yourself.  As the sole posessor of the right to get yourself into such a situation, you are also the sole posessor of the responsibility to make sure you can get out of it.
Of course, as a believer in the free market, I support the right of anyone to charge "whatever the traffic will bear" in such a situation for sustenance or transport - and it seems to me that unprepared traffic might be ready to bear some extreme prices.  And worth every penny for the object lesson in preparedness.
It can be a subtle concept to those not accustomed to sole responsibilities going with autonomous rights -- but this is exactly correct.  When you have the right to do as you please, the only way to not die is to not please to do really stupid things.  If nobody has the right to stop you, nobody should be expected to put themselves out to rescue you either.

Hmm.  I see your point.  Freedom among equals means that neither has the right to place a burden upon the other.  A can't command B to do anything, and B can't command A to do anything.  If A wants to wander out into the middle of the desert, A knows damn well he'd better provide for himself, because, while he can *ask* B for help, and if B isn't a jerk he'll probably provide it, A has no right to *command* B to help. Classic case; A didn't plant anything on his fields, didn't work the land, didn't do any food gathering or hunting -- does A now have the right to *command* B to feed him, just because he'll starve if B doesn't?  If so then what motive does anyone have to get their own food, as long as their neighbor has enough to feed them? At what point does A stop looking like a victim to you and start looking like a leech?
Freedom among unequal people is a very different matter.  Or is it? It *looks* like a different matter, when, as you point out, one person can be born in the middle of another's desert.  But people can only be born to parents who are somehow surviving in that environment. The implication is that the environment is survivable after all, and your life does *NOT* in fact depend on the power to make a burdensome demand.  And if you can survive there, then you have some kind of power that you can probably use to work your way out of it with sufficient skill, planning, and hard work.
I come from a family of mostly disenfranchised people.  Persecuted religious minorities living in poverty and isolation on my mom's side, hillbillies living in poverty and isolation on my dad's side. I had a pretty serious "desert" to work my way out of, so I know what you're talking about in a way that most americans won't.  And I still say that private ownership and freedom, in most things, is a better path.
I believe in enough government to provide elementary education for all who want it, to break up monopolies occasionally when there is really egregious abuse of monopoly power, and to stop people from stealing from one another or killing one another.  To the extent that governments do other things, they are exceeding the authority I'd have assigned them.
I don't believe in protecting idiots from themselves.  If you protect idiots from themselves, it's very *VERY* expensive unless you also take away their freedom to get into trouble.  And that means taking away the freedoms of reasonable men to do something of their own choosing as well.

@_subject: Cryptographic protocols for government? 
I've been thinking about the Bell case and what it represents. The case really turns on a central point, I think; an individual's right or lack thereof to do the things for himself that government traditionally does for him.  The government normally investigates crooks, ostensibly for the benefit of the citizens.  But what happens when a citizen attempts to do the same?  Well, we get the sort of thing that's happening in that courtroom.  Bell made it pretty personal, evidently, and his idea of what constitutes a "crook" may differ from yours, mine, and (especially) that of the government of the US, and he was evidently bungling the investigation anyway (wasn't able to find whom he was looking for and wound up pestering people who had the same name or lived at the same h
ouse...). But seriously, what was he doing?  At least in his own mind, he was investigating a crook.  And what was AP?  (besides being unimplementable and susceptible to all kinds of abuse by anyone with money?) It was an attempt
at a cryptographic protocol to regulate the use of force. In effect, it was a protocol intended to replace government.
And this brings up some very fundamental points about the distinction between private citizens and agents of a government, especially if you ascribe to the view that all government powers are derived from and ultimately belong to the people. I personally think that, as information becomes more and more available, government becomes less and less necessary.  Or maybe the idea should be expressed as "Government is a protocol for collaborative or collective action in the absence of the availability of complete information and the bandwidth to disseminate it.  As the information becomes available, the need for this protocol declines."  And in a crypto-enabled world, where anyone can say anything anonymously and as publicly as they like, information will be available.  (insert caveat re: sturgeon's law)  But Bell's behavior brings up other issues.  For collaborative or collective action, you can't have one guy haring off with his own definitions of everything and trying to enforce laws nobody else believes exist.
So, a question.  How could a reasonably peacable and stable  society, lacking government-as-we-know-it but rich in automation
and cryptographic protocols, deal with crime and criminals? Is there any way to ensure that the actions taken by the group (you may think of it as "laws enforced", but "law" has an odd flavor of meaning in the absence of government-as-we-know-it) actually conform to a consensus of what the people want enforced, without unduly trampling the dissenters nor creating positions of disproportionate power for individuals?  How could people doing investigations be compensated and sustained at an appropriate level by the group? Do some information resources need to be restricted to those doing investigations?
I have some ideas on how to do similar things for moderating mailing lists, but no solid ideas yet on how to regulate the use of physical force.

Since Third voice was found floating belly up at the top of the fishtank the other day, I've been looking at their service. I think the idea is fundamentally good; subscribers should be able to see each other's commentary on websites.  That's basic speech and reputation working on the internet and a channel that's at least potentially not biased by advertising revenues. However, they had two fundamental problems; 1) As a business, the idea is fundamentally bad, because    there is no viable revenue model.  Clients aren't going    to pay for the service, advertisisers hated their guts,
   and the people who put up the web sites in the first    place were going to fight tooth and nail against having    ordinary people express their honest opinions about their    companies.
2) The central-server model is another problem, because it    created a central point at which the system could be    shut down.
However, this looks like an excellent application for freenet or something like it.  If it's distributed, peer-to-peer, and run by the clients so there's nobody they need to pay, there's also nobody to yell at and no central server to shut down. It's probably do-able to write a little application that runs on the host machine -- and when the browser loads a website, the application consults freenet asking for commentary from other clients about that website.  You could do this a couple of ways; you could watch the history file for new URL's to tell you what URL has just been loaded, or the cache for HTML pages to see what HTML has just been loaded. And that could be the cue for your little application.  Are there any more direct hooks into browsers?  Is there any "what URL is being displayed right now" API call for example?

It's not so much about weaponry, I don't think.  It's about organization and communication.  Muskets, in the hands of people who actually know where to point them and when, are still just as effective against mafia (et al) as they have always been. But it has become far more difficult to keep track of where to point them and when -- partly as a result of advances in surveillance and the availability of information about people that is beyond their physical control, threats against an individual can originate from far more quarters and in far more ways than ever before. These days I don't think of physical weapons as the appropriate tools of the revolutionary.  And face it; the "barriers to entry" are sufficiently large that they cannot practically be overcome on that score.  If you go pointing guns at government types, or even mere mafiosi, then sooner or later you will die. Because of the immediate response to weapons, the only resources you will take down first are those defined as expendable - police officers, treasury agents, low-level legbreakers, whatever.  These are resources that the organization can replace instantly and painlessly, and which will not cause it any real pain.
But these organizations have hierarchies.  Because they are not fully distributed, there are resources within each organization that serve a role or function, or have privelege, that is not the same as that of other resources.  If you pick things that are extremely hard to replace, and things in the absence of which the system will not function, then a very few moves can cripple the organization.  Sometimes such moves can be made with a musket, if one has sufficient intel. But just as often a pen or a camera or a tape recorder will do.

This is not true any more.  The automated analysis of trawled data has advanced considerably beyond keyword searching at this point; there are programs out there now specifically looking for much more subtle and complicated things, which were formerly the domain of intelligence analyists, and they are actually pretty damn good.  The simple keyword searchers and keyphrase searchers you hear about with echelon are only the front line; they pass their data back to much more sophisticated AI programs that analyze content, and synthesize information gleaned from massive numbers of such missives.   Every time a situation like the Aum Shenrikyo (spelled?) subway attack happens, if the automated analysis suite didn't point it out first, human analysts come in and check out the dataflows that ran before it and around it, and create a new auto-analysis program.  And then later, when another group that has anything like the same rhetoric and seems to be going through the same logistical steps pops up, the auto-analysis finds it without human help. I do not speak of specific known programs here; but my primary background is in AI and expert systems, and I can state unequivocally that intelligence analysis funded most of the research in the field for a very long time, and that programs such as I described above are well within the current state of the art.  It is unusual for them to be deployed very widely in private industry because in private industry there is a real problem of retaining personnel with the proper expertise to work on them.  They tend to be delicate in their operation -- you go to make a minor change in the data or the rules or the schemas and the performance of all other parts of the system degrades unless you are extremely careful, well-trained, and, let's face it, consistently just plain smarter than normal people.  But when they are in tune, and their vocabulary tables are up-to-date, they are highly accurate.
The problem of keeping these systems in tune is what drives most practical AI research today; the systems are effective, but brittle and unable to cope with subtle changes and variations very well. "Fuzzy" approaches like ANN's and Genetic Algorithms are attempts to get past this problem by making self-adjusting systems, but the volumes of data required to get self-adjustment working using such approaches are a problem; you'd have to have data from  hundreds of Aum Shenrikyo type attacks before your GA or ANN really had a good chance of picking out what parts of the dataflow were relevant.
So here's my speculation: human analysts are probably called in only after something takes the automatic tools by surprise, or when there is an administrative need for specific analysis that the automatic tools do not provide.

Her point, Tim, is that she doubts such a thing will ever be deployed widely or accepted, because she can't see a way for someone to make money at it. As presented, I think she's probably right.  Nobody in conventional business is going to want to do a deal with someone when they can't create a legally enforceable contract.  And "reputation capital" that would counteract that point to some extent depends on maintaining a consistent traceable pseudonym as someone who does something illegal, for decades, without getting linked to it.

This is true, but look at the mechanisms for enforcing contracts that they *do* use.  Most of them are not compatible with anonymity, and only a few are compatible with pseudonymity. Mafia Bosses don't buy information from someone when they don't know where that someone lives.  It's the exact same enforceability of contracts problem that other parts of society uses lawyers to deal with.  Legbreakers or cops, basically they have the same job with regard to contract enforcement.  There has to be a hook where someone who does a ripoff can be punished, or else there is no deal.
When you talk about a one-time transaction, it pretty much has to involve something whose value can be ascertained ON THE SPOT.  otherwise, there is either a continuing relationship that can't be unilaterally broken (ie, they know where you live) or there is no deal.  The value of information (other than entertainment value) is not generally ascertainable on the spot, because if you don't have at least some of the information, you can't check something that claims to be the information. Also, you often have to do a couple days work figuring out information formats and problems before you can even do your checking against it, particularly with financial data. But which are generally not done anonymously.  In these cases, there is no test of a protocol's ability to protect pseudonymity from a determined opponent, nor of the willingness to do business anonymously or pseudonymously.  Moreover, the determined opponent is often watching, even if no enforcement is attempted.
So far I have seen no example of a non-contracted business agreement between people who are unable to identify each other, which extends beyond a single transaction.  Basically one goes one way with his merchandise and the other goes the other way with her money, and it's over.  There's no business relationship that's ongoing; if they ever meet again, it's just a coincidence. If the transaction is illegal, then any business relationship that may be formed is a liability to all participants; they never know when the lions are going to grab someone and when that happens, the lions usually find out everything that someone knows. Real business involves lasting relationships.  You don't want to be owed money, or merchandise either, by someone who can just shed the pseudonym and disappear. Tim, I don't know why you're calling me "Lawyer larvae".  I'm not in Law school, nor have I ever been. What Aimee and I both seem to be pointing out here is that while it is *possible* for people to do business anonymously/pseudonymously, a whole new economy would have to grow up that way in order for it to become routine.  You are really and truly talking about building from scratch with effectively no interface to the way business is currently done.  I can respect that, but keep in mind that all the peripheral mechanisms of the way business is currently done will be trying to stomp the "aberration" out.  In order to grow an anonymous economy, you'd need literally decades of time during which there were few conflicts with any part of the established infrastructure, and so that the emerging system could grow its own traditions and customs and routines.  Within that separate space, you could do business as you describe.  But during the whole building time, and until the new economy's traditions and routines are reflected in a robust system with enforcement capabilities, almost any contact with the existing economy would be destructive.  It would be like building in the outlands, beyond civilization entirely.  It will happen, and it should; the laws governing it are the laws of mathematics and computability, and humankind will build the structures that those laws can support just as surely as humankind given the opportunity will occupy a new frontier. But I don't believe that it's going to have much to do with established business or extant business models.  Its basic required infrastructure and traditions are fundamentally incompatible with all current legal codes and methods of doing business, and will be attacked by all current enforcement capabilities whenever and wherever detected.
The "cipherspace outlands" will have to be built pretty much separate from current business and the laws that apply to it.  Otherwise it'll take centuries instead of decades.

Tim; One thing to consider is the role of "credit histories", or virtually any other identity-linked information, in a milieu  where the people have access to the necessary techniques and programs to do those deals. You sell Alice a credit history on Bob; Bob takes a new identity; Alice is back to square one.  Why would Alice buy credit histories?

Okay, as some have pointed out, I've been a little too flip in assuming that people's nyms will "vanish" if they get into real trouble. It's true that nyms like "Pr0duct Cypher", which represent the authorship claim to years of code and writing, are not going to be abandoned over a $10 transaction, and if P. Cypher were to put that nym on the line for a deal, I wouldn't hesitate to accept it. The problem arises because the means of building reputation are so utterly ill-defined.  Having read P. Cypher's list contributions and software, and having a public key to check his/her/their signatures against, suffices in an individual case.  But commerce - large, heavy, routine commerce between relative strangers, which is the fundamental strength of our markets, requires there to be some standard format or method of presenting reputation capital that can be checked.  The only thing I can think of is a set of endorsements verifying deals done already.  But that is exactly the information that most of you say you don't want disclosed.  Escrow agents and reputation agents definitely help -- they can overcome a lot of difficulties involving who gets paid what and when.  But now you've got a third party in your deal, charging vigorish when one of your main hopes was to get away from the tax man charging vigorish.

I was offering a definition for 'fully distributed.'  It is possible for a system to be distributed without being fully distributed. The existence of structures, priveleges, or roles in some parts which cannot arise in other parts, or cycles where nodes can be excluded if other nodes are removed, are possible in some distributed systems.  The subset of distributed systems in which they are not possible, I call 'fully distributed'.
Napster is an example of a system which is partially distributed. If it were fully distributed, you could pull the plugs out of the servers at napster and the users would never notice.  Usenet is an example of a system which is fully distributed.  If all the backbone nodes went down tomorrow, a thousand linux geeks across the country could work out the news routing software and could put it back up without them inside of a week.  Basically, they've already got all the software they need to deal with NNTP. There is specialization, but it is specialization chosen, not imposed by the protocol, and if the situation required it, the remaining nodes would simply change their specialization. Not necessarily.  I might have the means to produce it, but not the time or inclination or expertise.  Specialization, among humans in meatspace, does not happen because people have different types of hands. It happens because people have choices about what they can do and they choose to do one thing instead of another. If the system isn't fully distributed, there are choices about what role to take in it that you can't make even if you want to. Napster users couldn't choose to set up their own site as an indexing node, for example; it was a reserved role.  Some of them might have specialized in rap and others in pop, as a choice, and they had reasons to trade with one another. But none could replace a lost indexing node, so it was possible to shut the system down
and put all the traders out of business, by shutting down one node.  A critical error in design, tolerated because they were trying to set up a "toll booth" at the weak point in the structure.
Government and many other organizations work the same way; there are irreplaceable nodes within them that, if shut down, spell the death of the organization.  (Hint: it ain't the president of the US).  What some here call crypto anarchy, may well wind up being only the fully distributed form of government.

Nyms are not as hard as most of you seem to assume.  Each instance of a nym's use is more data for traffic analysis, and writing styles contain "signature" usages that can identify particular writers with a high degree of probability.  If the probability is ever deemed high enough that a search warrant can issue, and your nym is involved in all kinds of illicit deals which are verifiable through the reputation system, then  you have a problem because the lions are likely to come take your favorite toys away, and may even put you through a "trial" like the one that just happened to Mr. Bell.
Hmm.  A worthwhile hack; I should develop a program that uses the known techniques of identifying a writer by his/her style, and then create "styles" to conform to for each nym.  If I can fool my program, then there's at least a prayer of fooling other people's.

(Re: CDR RE: snipped from headers.....)
Give me a few dozen writing samples from each of a hundred known people, and another writing sample a hundred words long from one of them under a pseudonym, and I can tell you to a 90% probability which of the hundred known people wrote it. If some persistent pseudonym has a record with hundreds or thousands of illicit transactions, the lions are going to be crawling cyberspace for *any* writing that matches its style closely enough to have been written by the same person.  They'll get a short list.  Then they'll start eliminating possibilities and when they're down to three or four they'll start getting wiretap orders.
With the wiretap order, they can run a sting or a man-in-the-middle attack so they've got one solid charge.  That will net them an arrest warrant if it works.  But whether this works or not, they can still get a search warrant after they give it a shot. If the machine is not theft-secure (and face it, almost no machines are), the arrest warrant issues anyway and the owner of the pseudonym winds up in jail.  And the lions didn't have to do any particularly clever cryptanalysis to get there.  All they had to do was run a spreadsheet counting grammar, word choice, sentence length, and a few
other parameters until they found a match.

A worthwhile question for Cypherpunks -- all of the court decisions and cites are, technically, public domain information.  And yet access to that information, in terms of legal databases, remains either extremely expensive, or the province of a Priveleged Caste (to whom "extremely expensive" looks like "normal business expenses"). Westlaw owns some of the most expensive copyrights, per-copy, of any entity -- and all they've done is number the pages and paragraphs and provide an index on public domain information.
I think that there is, or ought to be, a good cypherpunk solution to making legal cites available for everyone.  A distributed law library, hosted on many servers?  Legal cites on Freenet?

The real problem with hiding or secrecy as a total strategy is that there can be no community.  Your lovely crypto-auction protocol is no damn good unless you can get a critical mass of people to participate in a marketplace, and rather useless unless those people can be anonymous.  Ebay may be a good thing, but can you imagine how useless it would be if it had to be kept secret from law-enforcement types?  You'd pretty much have to keep it secret from the whole public, and then of course nobody would use it. I've got a nice protocol for running a fully-encrypted mailing list stegoized in images on a web/FTP site, which would be totally invisible to non-participants - but such a list can't be announced publicly so of course nobody could find out about it and join it, without also letting the law know about it and join it. And the list goes on.  Every time you try to get something used by more than a dozen people, it cannot be secret.  What cannot be secret, you can't keep the law from knowing about.  What you can't keep the law from knowing about, you can't keep the law from trying to regulate.  And regulation of anything on the internet can happen, because EVERY IP address is in principle traceable.  Oh, it may take a week or two -- they may have to slap your ISP with an order to preserve logs and wait for the next time something happens if you're on DHCP, or they may have to get the cooperation of one or more other governments if your login trail runs outside their jurisdiction -- but ultimately, it's traceable.

Take your focus off the individual message.
Okay?  Now look at the system, the infrastructure, that you need to send that message anonymously. It relies on identifiable remops existing at known addresses.  Known to the people sending messages == known to the cops.
If the law wants to take this thing down, they will  not be attacking the strongest point -- ie, trying to trace individual messages. Instead, they will attack the weakest point -- trying to drive remailer operators out of business and thus destroy the infrastructure you need.  That is the threat model I'm concerned about, and given that network monitoring is now automatable and cheap, it is entirely do-able.
So what?  A move by the g8 to protect the "global infrastructure" of the Internet, (polspeak for protecting their ability to control what the sheep think) followed by laws passed in individual countries, would force remops to operate solely in "rogue states", and messages to and from them could be screened out pretty simply.

And in an agent provocateur mode, the software is illegal the minute they want it to be -- all they have to do is show a DMCA violation (which they can manufacture at will) and declare the software illegal as a "circumvention device".

King George II seems intent on drumming up support for a space weapons platform.  This is interesting for a couple of reasons. First, it looks likely to drive a massive wedge between the US and its current allies.  Nobody who can't afford to put up their own orbiting weapons platform is going to be happy about the US doing so. Second, it pretty much means the US is going to have to withdraw from the space treaty of 1965, which bans space weapons.  This latter is actually more interesting to me, because that treaty also bans national claims of sovereignty over off-earth property (or else Neil Armstrong would have been saying the ancient incantation, "we claim this new land in the name of...." when he planted that American flag on the moon in '69) and, more importantly, private claims of ownership on off-earth property.
As far as I know there is no direct legislation banning such ownership in the US -- so it looks to me like the US withdrawing from that treaty would allow US corporations to do things like register mining claims or other claims on the moon or other off-earth real estate, or a US expiditionary force to make a national claim of sovereignty over the Moon or Mars or whatever the next time there's a government-sponsored landing on either of those bodies.
If someone actually tries it, we'll se an interesting test.
Although, perhaps not coincidentally, a space weapons platform orbiting Earth is also exactly what you need if you intend to *defend* claims of national sovereignty on the Moon, asteroids, Mars, etc.

So, your typical user has to wait thirty seconds, which is no big deal, but the guy who's trying to register every word in a million-

I would actually like to make a smaller point here. Broadly I agree with BU, but I'd like to analyze it a little.
If software actually cost money per every unit produced, products liability would make more sense because then it could become "part of" the production costs.
However, given that copying bits is in fact free (copyright issues aside), adding a real per-unit expense has the potential to *dominate* the production cost.  Open-source software would become impossible to produce, because the whole open-source paradigm depends on copying bits being free.
I think MS would like nothing better than having products liability attached to software in general; it would solve a massive problem for them by putting open-source stuff out of production.  Even though the open-source stuff is better from a security standpoint, there is effectively no one who is making enough money from it to bear the costs of product liability. Some security consultants *do* bear the cost of product liability on software they install and configure; they are paid obscene amounts of money to take that risk and do the solid configurations that minimize it, and that is as should be.  The effect of product liability on the industry as a whole would be to remove the only secure products available (open-source products), making it effectively impossible for security consultants to do their jobs.

At the first job I had out of college, we spent almost six months busily "updating the look" of an application that worked perfectly well, so that the sales guys could impress people not only with how well it worked, but also with how "slick" it was. So we did color fades on title bars, and added gray to our white scroll bars, and rearranged dialog boxes, and exchanged our athena widgets for motif widgets that worked exactly the same, and moved stuff from the regular menus to the right-mouse menu, and made our "drawn oval" buttons into rectangular buttons that were lighter on the upper and left edges and darker on the lower and right edges (which, laughably, was called "making them 3-d"), and converted the internal documentation from troff and TeX to HTML, and did about a jillion other tiny things that added nearly zero functionality but brought the old application up to the current idea of "style".  A year after I left, I heard from someone who had stayed that they were reimplementing the interface as a "thin client" application, because thin clients had come into style.  Note -- it had an XWINDOWS INTERFACE to start with!!! your "thin client" on an Xwindows interface is neither more nor less than a standard X server running on the machine where you want the interface to appear!
At another company, a few months ago, a lead developer came to me announcing that they were developing a parser to convert an application langauge into an XML schema using a whizbang database that had somehow sprouted an XML interface,
and they were having trouble with recursive structures in the formal schema description the database wanted.  I said, "is there a reason we're not using lex? lex handles recursive structure just fine." The response, of course, is that nobody wants to tell customers we're using lex to generate our XML, because lex isn't in style.... but this whizbang database (and why does a *database* have XML-conversion functions??) is.
I see a lot of engineering effort wasted on silly fads. Good people spending days and sometimes weeks reinventing wheels that represent problems that were solved decades ago, just because the solutions developed then, despite being proven and correct, are presently out of style. It's a waste of resources and it pisses me off.

Not really.  To that extent, a gnutella scanner is probably already in the hands of any law enforcement types that are interested, and there's no reason gnutella itself ought not benefit from the same technology.  Better points, since I need to spell them out, are:
            for people who wanted to shut it down.
I think that all network applications ought to be able to find other nodes running other copies of the application - but be very careful how you design it, so as not to piss people off.  A nice low-overhead scanner that doesn't generate complaints, would be a request and response on some other protocol.  If you write a little cgi program, say IsGnutellaThere.cgi, and have gnutella users drop it into their apache (or iis, or whatever) directory, then you can make an HTTP request on port 80.  IsGnutellaThere.cgi would run and check to see if the gnutella server is up and what port it's on, maybe check a table to find other gnutellas that it knows about,
and return that information in an http response.  Then gnutella users who wanted to be scannable (and not all of them will) could drop the program into their CGI directory, and scan-enabled gnutellas could just learn how to make a simple HTTP request and keep that table up-to-date for IsGnutellaThere.cgi to access.
HTTP is low-overhead and innocuous, and there's already a hole for it in most firewalls.  It won't generate alarms.  A straight-up "scanning" approach most definitely will.

Squawking on a mailing list is protected behavior, and I figure you can probably do that all you want.  As someone else here pointed out, "You have to do something else" before they can arrest you.
But now that certain types of code have been criminalized, writing code counts as "something else".  So the lesson is, if you squawk on mailing lists, don't write code. If you write code, don't squawk on mailing lists, especially about the illegitimate uses to which criminals may put your code. So we each must come to our own decision; write code, or continue to squawk?  Because cypherpunks, unless they want to join the canarypunks, don't write code anymore. My decision is made. Goodbye.

There's kind of a feedback loop here; Windows achieved critical mass and Apple didn't.  Hence, MS can afford to hire lots more engineers to work on their CRAPPY os than Apple can hire to work on their mediocre os.  So, after a while, Windows got better than the MacOS.  I remember how hard Win3.11 sucked compared to MacOS 5.  But once true multitasking was under WinNT3.51, it was about Neck-and-neck for quality with MacOS 7.  And like Mr. Zakas, I'm pretty convinced that even though MacOS 10 has true multitasking, it has definitely fallen behind WinNT 4. ObCryptoStuff; this same kind of "critical mass" phenomenon affects lots and lots of the stuff we're looking at.  Freenet, Mojo Nation, Napster, Gnutella, Digital Cash, etc, even PGP and GPG - All have a value that depends directly on how many other people are using them. If they don't grow beyond a certain threshold size, they remain less useful than the disk space they occupy.  But where is the threshold and when is it passed? And how do you get there?  If P2P agents were distributed with a couple of the major linux distributions (say Red Hat and SuSE) they'd probably achieve critical mass fairly fast (especially if they were set up and configured during install, the way Apache increasingly is).  And if they were opensource, they'd probably get into ALL linux distributions within a few years. But so far most of the people doing P2P are trying to make a buck off of it, so with the exception of gnutella, there aren't open-
source agents.

One of the crucial things needed to understand what goes on cypherpunks is that about three-quarters of the people see half or less of the posts.  Having set up spamfilters adequate to give the list a reasonable S/N, you wind up having cut out a substantial fraction of the signal. Another crucial thing needed to understand what goes on cypherpunks are that certain of the regulars are trolls and/or cranks, and will say utterly outrageous things simply in order to "tweak" the presumed eavesdroppers or scare away people whom they regard as too timid to be worth talking to anyhow. It's best interpreted as performance art after the style of Andy Kaufmann. Regarding the paper you referred us to:  While the author has come up with a lot of references as quotes to cite, few or none of them bear directly on the central theme of his paper.  He presents a number of people who have a number of interesting things to say, some of them even on topic, but NO research or study that supports his central point of electronic communications as a first cause for the development of mass hate. A vehicle, sure.  But not a first cause.  And there's nothing really unique about it as a vehicle.
Television, in my opinion, is far more dangerous in that regard, due to having fewer available channels.  With TV, it takes only a very few people to decide that the airwaves should all be saturated with the same lopsided viewpoints.  The internet, by comparison, is chaos. People uninterested in hate will find no reason whatsoever to visit hate sites, and since virtually everything is available (see  or for examples of how weird it can get out there) a call to hate can be made by anoyone, but will attract no attention outside the limited community that has self-selected as being a priori interested in it. Even the relatively small set of people who are interested in hate find themselves spoiled for choice; Name any group of people, and you can find dozens of hate-mongers calling for their extermination on the web.  In this environment, it is virtually inconcievable that any *one* hate ideology should ever become the dominant hate ideology -- this breaks up the process described in the paper at the "identification of villains" stage. As to the "moral boundaries" issue, I'll have to ask my girlfriend's husband about that - his dissertation was about what musical styles evolve in cultures whose moral boundaries are in conflict or change.

A much better article on the topic can be found at The problem is that data that's been written over once, or even twice or ten times, can often still be read if someone actually takes the platters out and uses electromagnetic microscopy on them. If you "erase" data using the perl script in the article Jim pointed at, it will be safe from J. Random who doesn't have much time, money, or technique to spend on it.  But it won't be safe from TLA's, commercial data-recovery shops, or any seriously "hardcore" hackers (or people who, for example, know enough to take it to a commercial data-recovery shop). To actually finish the job, you'd want extremely low-level access to the drive, including the ability to micro-adjust the head alignment so as to write garbage both hubward and rimward of where the track you're trying to erase *ought* to be within its sector, which of course would require you to be able to relocate the info on the sectors physically hubward or rimward of the track you were trying to erase, because writing hubward or rimward with micro-adjustments within a sector could cause errors on those adjacent sectors. I don't know of any OS that provides sufficiently low-level HD access to allow people to create a portable utility that does really secure deletion.  Hell, a lot of Hard Drives don't even have drivers that support the needed operations.
The moral of the story is, in a really secure system, the plaintext NEVER hits your hard drive.

Disinformation is such an ugly word...  and the published fed specs on secure wiping apply to not-very-sensitive data.  For highly sensitive data, most secure wipe specs are classified, or, as someone else here pointed out, involve physical destruction of the drive. I think this is probably one of the biggest gaps remaining in system security.  If you are careful, you can use BSD and GPG etc to build a quite secure box - but if sensitive plaintexts are ever stored on the drive, even if they are overwritten, then when a data thief willing to spend enough bucks gets the drive, you lose.
At the very least, we need browsers that don't store their caches, cookies, or history files in cleartext.
We need mail programs that never EVER write the cleartext to the We need newsreaders that don't store the articles in cleartext, or for that matter the list of newsgroups that someone is subscribed We need editors that don't put cleartext on the disk when you hit the "save" command.
This is basic stuff, fundamental.  Hardware theft is a threat model that's been far too often ignored in the design of secure systems. Why bother to build a good cipher if you leave the plaintext lying around where it can be stolen?

Not quite.  The point which you start with in the random number stream is one of the keys, but the system he describes also includes another, which is used to encrypt the random number stream prior to the OTP's XOR operation. The rest of your post, I agree with. First, your orbital random number server can only be put there by someone with enough bucks to launch a rocket -- whom you have to trust implicitly. None of the twenty or thirty people whom I trust implicitly has that much money.  Heck, I don't even think I personally *know* anyone who has that much money.
What if it was just a few dozen Blum-Blum-Shub generators up there spewing all those bits?  We'd never see the difference, but a data thief who was "in the know" about how they were keyed could recreate any sequence at any time.  The basic problem is the problem you always get with systems that have a "trusted server" sitting in the middle -- can you really trust that server?  Can you inspect it, and inspect the code it's running, personally?  Can you verify that the thing you were allowed to inspect is the same as the thing that you're trusting?
I don't see any government, or for that matter any criminal organization, with a significant investment in SigInt allowing such a launch to go up untampered if they could possibly prevent it. And we already have systems with barriers of ridiculous levels of computer hardware - proofs of the security of a cipher which rest on the assumption that the opponent has storage capacity limited to less than some finite value are no more nor less valid than proofs of the security of a cipher which rest on the assumption that the opponent has CPU capacity limited to less than some finite value.  The only value of this system, assuming you get random numbers you can trust, is that the opponent has to have the large storage capacity NOW - when we know how hard it would be to have it - rather than at some vague point in the future, where moore's law has had time to work its wonders. Finally, this system doesn't protect storage.  It protects communications, and communications only.  Think about it.  If you protect storage, you have to have the bits from the OTP around somewhere to decrypt it.  If you have the bits from the OTP around somewhere, you no longer have an unbreakable cipher.

Here's an interesting thought, though.  There are all kinds of number generators already hanging in the sky, and some of them are fairly random, so this thing might actually have a prayer of working.
Take a good telescope, and focus on, eg, Jupiter's Red Spot. (ignoring for a moment the problems of focus and synchronization).
That's turbulence - a pretty damn good source of randomness. If Bob and Alice can see the same image, and derive the same stream of random numbers from it, this scheme might be salvaged yet. The bandwidth wouldn't be quite as high, especially allowing for enough "roughness" to keep it likely that the number streams Alice and Bob get have enough correlation to work with - but it might serve.

The problem with an encrypted drive is that the applications that are able to write it have got to do key management, and all of those existing applications were written with the assumption that they didn't have to do key management.
There are various workarounds, but that's what they are - workarounds. If your application can read and write an encrypted drive without specifically providing the keys, then a trojan on your system can read and write an encrypted drive without specifically providing the keys. These workarounds can only work by "hiding" key management from the application, and thus from the user - which means key management gets done badly if at all.  Good crypto can't be tacked on - it has to be designed in.
Another problem with an encrypted drive is that an encrypted drive is infrastructure that someone is likely to not have in place when they first discover a real need to encrypt.  Don't get me wrong -- I believe in encrypted drives.  They provide a "mix" so you can't tell which bit was written by what application, and that's a valuable service.  But there are limits to what they can do or should be relied on to do.  Applications that write to (and more importantly, which read from) the encrypted drive should themselves be crypto-aware and do proper key management.

I don't think micropayments are going to work in anything like their present form.  I do not want to be pestered about "is it okay to spend half a cent on X?"  or "Subscriptions to Y cost only $12 a year" kind of stuff.  That's too much cognitive If they can fix micropayments so that I can authorize my web agent to spend up to $5 a month and not pester me about it, they might have something I'd use.
But the whole "not pester" thing is at odds with what a lot of sites want to accomplish.  For example, a web agent that was only authorized to spend five bucks a month would regard any site containing links that cost more than a penny as too expensive a place to be - and after it discovered this, I'd want it to reformat pages returned from search engines etc to de-emphasize those links and the text about the site. If the agent thinks it's too expensive, it sure as hell shouldn't be on the first page of search results - at least not the first page of search results the agent shows me.
Conversely, if the web agent is not authorized to spend money, then sites supported by micropayments ought to be cut completely out of search engine results, and links to them found elsewhere ought to behave as "dead links" as far as my browser is concerned.  I never EVER want to have to remember a username and password for a site supported by micropayments -- again, the cognitive load is too high for the piffling amounts we're talking about. My web agent ought to keep me informed about which of my online habits are expensive and in what degree - but that's maybe a trailing-two-weeks summary about how the budgeted money is being spent, not an "okay to spend half a penny?" dialog every ten seconds on the site. Finally, sites supported by micropayments are going to have to figure out something about web spiders.  If "scooter" can't spend several million dollars a month on these places, they're not going to get into the altavista database, for example.  So if you want the site to be in a search engine at all, you're going to have to let the search engine's robot cruise the site for free.  Wanna bet it would be about twenty seconds before somebody released a "Pretend to be a web spider and browse pay sites for FREE!" utility?

Right.  All the "content-for-pay" artists now have to compete against all the unpaid amateurs who are webpublishing because webpublishing is easy and nearly free.  Unless they can provide content that is absolutely above and beyond what the amateurs can do technologically and artistically, they are going to discover that there is no paying market for their stuff.  Right.  And that's when they learn something they did was expensive and not to do that again.  As long as the web agent can keep it under the budgeted amount, a few mistakes (and even a few scams) can be tolerated.  The race would be between people trying to build smarter web agents (popping up and saying, "Hey boss, this link's always been free before, but now it costs a buck -- are you sure you want to go there?") and finding more subtle ways to try and rip them off. Beyond a certain level of subtlety, ripping people off is known as "marketing," and considered a non-problem. Absolutely.

@_subject: Digital Cash with dynamic range 
Most of the protocols I'm finding for digital cash don't have much in the way of dynamic range.  Generally, there is a range of values that they are designed for (rarely more than a factor of a thousand or so from smallest to largest) and smaller payments become impossible and larger payments become impractical. The problem is particularly severe for offline protocols, where you can't get the bank online to make change or issue arbitrary-valued coins. Does anyone know any happy exceptions to this rule, where payments ranging from a millionth of a token up through several million  tokens could all be practical?  (ie, dynamic range of the twelfth or higher order?)
Anyway, the "practical in arbitrary amounts" assumption is pretty fundamental to useful money.  We achieve it through bank drafts, checks, transfer orders, etc.  But these instruments are not as clear how to do in a digital world where anonymity is preserved. In particular, I haven't found low-level details of how the "Mojo" tokens in use by the new MojoNation stuff work. Are they just an implementation of a well-documented protocol, or did they do something

I have a question: given that half the bandwidth and almost all of the spike bandwidth is devoted to smurfing, why don't IRC servers just block multicast ping? I mean, okay, so it's in the kernel code instead of being a separate application.  It still shouldn't be hard to come up with a patch that killed smurfing.
Pings should never be forwarded to multiple hosts.

sigh.  Americans tend not to call something a "kettle" unless it's large, at least a 6-qt capacity.  We don't have non-specialized electric cooking vessels in that size on the market.  However, we have electric coffeepots that size and larger, and electric "hotpots" of a smaller size (around 2qt) suitable for heating water to brew tea, and electric "rice cookers" of approx. 3-4qt capacity that are entirely suitable for boiling water if you don't want to cook rice.
I'd be inclined to think that this is just a terminology issue. Hm.  Not all furnaces are boilers.  Basically we use the word "furnace" here to mean the heating unit for a house.  One kind of furnace is a boiler, which heats liquid that then gets circulated through radiators.  Other types of furnaces are electrical, or fired by gas, coal, oil, or wood.  Sometimes they heat a gigantic rock that then radiates heat for days (this arrangement is popular in arid northern and northwestern states).  More often they heat air, channeled through a heat-exchanger by a fan and then circulated directly through the rest of the house via ductwork.
Actual boiler-type furnaces are quite rare in the US, and I haven't seen a coal-fired furnace since I was a child. They're still out there, though; although they are now illegal for pollution reasons here in CA, there are places in the midwest where once in a while you still find them in use.

On the larger purchases, the costs drop down to the forty-cents-a-minute range.  Totally worth it if you really *need* anonymity on the phone.  Of course, anonymity is relative; these phones have built-in GPS chips for 911 calls, and these are activated from the central office, not by a 911-sensing circuit in the handset.  IOW, it is not impossible for someone with the right gear and knowhow to query the phone for its exact latitude and longitude at any moment when it's in use.  (I don't know whether it can be queried when it's switched off, nor if so whether removing the main batteries will stop it).  So if you're into hard anonymity, keep it inside a faraday cage when you're not using it and don't use it from inside your own dwelling. Faraday cages don't have to be fancy; a fruitcake tin will usually do.

Much of the rest (including GPS chips in cell phones "within the next couple of years," heard a couple of years ago) is gleaned from mainstream media and evidently has its share of distortions. An aside -- Contractors are now building uninsulated homes in Kansas (a climate where temperatures range from about 110 fahrenheit to -3 fahrenheit over the course of an average year) on floodplains, with slab foundations, not even buttressed down to the heave line and with no provision for airflow to mediate temperature - and people are buying them!

Until now it has been easy for people to be hypocritical about software piracy - to claim they're not doing it and don't support it when in fact a fair number of their IT procedures would not be possible if it were not done, at least in some small and usually transient ways. Did anybody else temporarily create a "pirate" installation of Windows NT 3.51 when they discovered that the installer for NT 4.0 beta refused to delete the primary partition and they needed to repartition their hard drives? It lasted twenty minutes, but since for that twenty minutes it was on more than just the original machine, it was a violation of EULA.
But if Microsoft and its ilk do in fact successfully create systems that prevent "piracy", it won't be possible to be a hypocrite about it any more.  And with commercial software flatly refusing some kinds of use, perhaps a fair number of people who now *think* they are not doing any piracy will have to face some harsh facts. Perhaps they will eventually realize that the way to avoid piracy without sacrificing usability is to use open-source free software. We can hope so anyway. In that scenario, this anti-piracy stuff could be one of the nails in Microsoft's coffin.

Are there any good general cryptographic protocols for groups taking group actions by formal consensus or voting rules?
I'm thinking of a "distributed agent" that is empowered to do various things but which is activated only by a vote of its owners.  This would be like a "Robo-moderator" for a newsgroup, or a "Robo-Personnel Administrator" for a company's Board of directors, or a "Robo-Rater" for a restaurant rating website, Crucial facts about a protocol that does the right thing would be: 1) DOES NOT create any single priveleged user or machine. 2) Resistant to denial-of-service attacks and attempts to    "stack the vote." (Requires user authentication)
3) No altered versions of the agent ought to be able to gather
   enough information to force an action as long as at least    the majority of agents are unaltered.
4) Once a consensus is reached, a majority of the agents acting
   together should be able to take whatever action is found
   even if the dissenters' agents don't cooperate with them.
   (a consensus reassembles a key?  But then that key can't    be used again, what's the next key?)

Actually, no.  That creates a single priveleged machine, which is also a point of failure, which is also a point of attack, which is also subject to subpeonas or outright theft.  Ideally, this is something that runs on the distributed machines of the participants.
I think that's the only way to be safe from the "lawsuit attack".
For example, consider a robo-moderated mailing list formed by cat owners.  They have a "posting protocol" that requires you to submit a digital coin worth a dollar or two along with your letter.  If enough people click on the "this is spam" button, the group agents donate the coin to an animal shelter and you can't spend it. Otherwise, you get your coin back when your message expires.  The posting protocols etc. are wrapped in scripts, of course; on your end you get a message box that says "Are you willing to post a two-dollar bond that says most of the people on the list don't think this is spam?"  and yes/no buttons.  The subscribers just have another little button on their mail reader - So it goes Next message, delete, reply, reply all, I'd really like it if somebody has figured out a way for a group to form consensus and act on that consensus as though it were a single individual -- capable of participating in general protocols.  But individual solutions to problems like the above would be a great start.

@_subject: copyright: moral right or outdated convention 
In the internet world, no publishers are needed - or if they are needed, it will only be as manufacturers of a physical commodity (bound printed pages) that people like better than what they can roll off their own printers.  And in fact, you find publishers living this way now -- I can still get recent printings of Mary Shelley's book _Frankenstein_, or Melville's _The Whale_, even though the copyrights on them are long gone.  So somebody out there is making a profit manufacturing bound volumes of public-domain words.  There's no reason the whole industry can't work that way.
A long time before there was copyright law, as it is now understood, there was literature.  When Virgil sat down to write about what the Gods had been up to lately, he didn't have to worry about who owned the characters; the characters were clearly in the public domain.  (He did have to worry about what the priests would think, though - the practice of stoning heretics was well-established).  But anyway, from the greeks forward, you get plays and works composed by many different authors, drawing upon characters and storylines and situations that had been dreamed up by earlier authors.  In Italy, characters like Scaramouche and Pantaloon emerged, and the entire Commedia Del Arte coalesced around them - written by dozens of different people, none of whom had to ask the others for any kind of permission.  In Germany, new stories were written about old characters like Tyll Eulenspeigel, each author developing something about the character that other authors had left out. And these people, acting in defiance of the principles that would later be enshrined as copyright law, created powerful, thoughtful literature.  How did this happen?
First, there were _Patrons_.  I use the word not in the sense of a movie watcher or theatre watcher today, but in the sense of its coinage.  At the time, a _Patron_ was someone who would underwrite the living expenses of an acting troupe or an author, in exchange for the right to have first access to any new work or new performance.
Sculptors and Painters also had their _Patrons_, but in those cases the works were non-copyable and the _Patron_ simply wound up owning it.  Today we would call such things "works for hire", or simply say that the _Patron_ had bought it and paid in advance.  But in the case of the acting troupes or the authors, the work the _Patron_ paid for would eventually be enjoyed by everyone.  You still find such people today, teaming up to support local ballet companies and theatre groups.  Considering that the incremental cost of copying bits is very near zero, I suppose that several _Patrons_ could easily support an author working on his next book, and then simply hand it off to public domain when it was finished.  With very few exceptions, the artist isn't going to get rich, but as someone who's seen publishing contracts, that doesn't really make a difference.  With very few exceptions, the artists don't get rich now.
The second reason such powerful literature was produced without the benefit of copyright, was because the characters themselves became Archetypes.  Each was formed not by a single quirky hand, but by hundreds of authors scattered by thousands of miles and many years. Innovations in an established character were either greeted with delight or shouted down, depending on whether they appealed to an audience's perception of the character.  And each author was free to develop new facets of the characters that hadn't been developed before.  Thus we see Scaramouche, in hundreds of plays, as the jester, the prankster, the happy-go-lucky ne'er-do-well.  But we also see him, a couple of times, as an old man, experiencing regrets, and as a sincere lover, striving to redeem himself, and so on...  These outlier plays, which would never have been dreamed up by the original author (whoever that might be) of Scaramouche, develop facets of the character that are a vital part of the whole. Without copyrights, characters and stories are free to grow beyond the vision of the artists who created them.
I don't think copyright is still necessary.  It existed for the sole reason of making new ideas profitable so that someone could afford to publish them.  But publishing new ideas is effectively free now, so it's become obsolete.  And our literature is sadly missing some of the things that copyrights destroyed.

@_subject: supremes to discriminate reality from images, censorship 
Which, actually, I'm reasonably sure it does.  But only by making the posession of such pictures a very serious legal risk.  This argument says, "as long as we are jailing people for having these images (and subjecting them to public humiliation and ostracism via 'sex offender notification' laws when they get out), a fair number of people who might otherwise want to have them won't consider it worth the risk."  Now that may be killing a *market*, but it doesn't have a damn thing to do with killing *demand*. This gets at something that I think is a very general principle; they wanted to get the suppliers who were abusing kids, fine.  They decided that in order to get the suppliers they'd have to destroy the market, so they made posession of kiddie porn illegal -- This is already overstepping bounds, because there were less restrictive methods available.  They could have made the posession of kiddie porn produced *after a particular year* illegal, for example.  But then they got so eager to kill the market that they made posession of anything which *appears to be* kiddie porn illegal....  which had no effect whatsoever on the suppliers who were abusing kids in the first place. They lost sight of the fact that killing the market was a means to an end in the first place, and not an end in itself.  Now, I think that there is a fundamental legal principle here, which is that every time you pass a law you ought to know exactly why you're passing it.  Every law ought to be passed pursuant to some clearly stated principle or set of principles, and the admission of new items to the set of principles that are considered just basis for law ought to be very carefully considered.  There's probably a fancy latin term for this, but I don't know what it would be.  Anyway, what has happened here is that there was a law passed (against kiddie porn) on the principle that we ought not allow people to profit from abusing kids.  And then a second law was passed (against CG pseudo-kiddie porn) on the principle that we ought not allow kiddie porn (a simplification or wilful misinterpretation of the purpose of the original law).
Basically, a new principle got elevated into the set that laws can be passed to uphold, without anybody actually stopping and thinking about it and making a decision.  And a bad law resulted. There is a fundamental rule here, which is that in a society governed by law you have to make decisions about and keep track of what principles laws can be passed to uphold.  In the long run, given the availability of crypto, any laws against posessing some particular flavor or type of bits are doomed to be unenforceable.
But still, that rule will always be with us, and while it remains unrecognized (or unimplemented) by governments, "regulatory creep" will continue to advance by the passage of bad laws.

Ms. Banks; My Great-grandparents believed firmly in protecting their children from the evils of the money-dominated society and worldly hypocrisy they saw around them.  They refused electricity, plumbing, motorcars, and other modern conveniences in order to live a simpler lifestyle close to God and as part of a reality they understood. I have not much in common with them, but before they passed we at least learned to respect and understand one another and became friends.  So, I do understand your desire to "protect" your children from the set of influences that can be encountered in the wide world.  However, I cannot condone your efforts to teach them anything useful or to protect them from anything threatening by cracking their password files.  First, it is rude to do so; in cryptographic discussions, people who undertake to break the security of others are referred to as "enemy" for a reason.  Second, it is cowardly. You are trying to avoid a confrontation by doing this covertly, but consider the consequences:  If you don't find anything, then you have invaded the privacy of innocents and cannot ask their forgiveness.
And if you do find something, then you will confront people with the knowledge that you committed a crime against them, and at the same time, try to treat that as a nonissue and give them guidance on another matter?  All that will teach them is that disrespect is acceptable behavior; something I hardly think you want them to learn. Now, I want to give you a page from my Amish Great-grandparents here; they are very intentional and very respectful toward one another, especially in matters of deciding what degree of protection from the world outside is appropriate.  They sit down and talk about it, with their kids and with their Elders, together. They talk about what's out there, about the influences it could have, about the consequences of changes in the degree or nature in which they set themselves apart.  And they don't hide it from the kids. They do not sneak around behind each others' backs, and after kids get to about the age of six, they don't search the kids' rooms unless the children ask them to.  In other words, they regard Trust as a high virtue and recognize it as the only way to build trustworthiness.  I happen to think that this approach is an excellent idea for people who want to protect children from evil influences, and recommend it to you.  If you want to know what's in the file, ask your child.  If you're afraid of what *might* be in that file, talk about it with your child.  Explain that you're concerned, and explain why, and ask whether your child shares your concerns and what concerns the child has, and above all LISTEN to what the child says.  As regards the cypherpunks list: "Blank Frank" is anonymous.  S/he could be anybody, or several different anybodies at the same time. You happened to catch it/him/her/them in a nasty mood, and at least one of it/him/her/them flamed you pretty hard.  Perhaps that particular persona of "Blank Frank" is all out of patience.  But try to understand why your intent would make someone angry; there are lots of people out here who are very bitter about being "protected" as children by authoritarian adults who refused us basic human trust - which seems to be your intent.  We find that intent repulsive.  Perhaps that particular "Blank Frank" is one of the wounded.  Try extending a little understanding for his/her pain, try to read past the vitriol, and try a little bit of that old fashioned Christian forgiveness, and you will see that even in his/her rage, "Blank Frank" was giving you basically the same advice I am giving you now. PS.

If you want secure systems, get a system that you can read the source code for and *see* what the hell is going on -- or *fix* it if you find something broken.
Finally, it's really nice to have a comprehensive system of permissions, etc -- that way some idiot running zork can't trash out anything that the system actually depends on, even if he runs a virus-infected zork.

Yes:  Windows has one documented public key that it uses to check software that gets, eg, mailed to it via outlook, or downloads in a webpage via Explorer, or etc, to decide whether it is "trusted" software or not.  If it is trusted software (presumably from Microsoft) then it can be run without popping up a dialog box and getting the user's attention/
permission. Otherwise, "normal" security methods apply. People with debuggers long since discovered that there is more than one key ( though there are conflicting reports about whether there are two or three), but had no idea why there would be more than one unless  Microsoft wanted to enable some third party to create "trusted" applications without Microsoft's knowledge or review.
Recently when a windows system was made available in a debug build (ie, with the symbolic names etc still in the code), it was discovered that one of the "extra" keys was named NSA_key, which gives at least a strong hint as to who else is allowed to create "trusted" downloadable software.

Your point is well taken; however, it is simply pragmatic that when one is mere weeks away from releasing a digital money system, given the current legal environment, one MUST NOT say so.
In order to maintain anonymity in the current legal environment, a digital money system will have to be independent of all nation states -- hence, not overtly tied to nor created by any known organization or person.  This presents major logistical difficulties for the idea of a "unified" system with a single currency; it becomes very difficult for an issuing authority to "redeem on demand" without becoming known.  The difficulties are different for the "every member a mint" model, but by no means less.

So I can go out in public nude, and not expect to be arrested?  Wrong. While, in absolute terms, the right to free expression ought to include the right to nudity, in practice it does not.  As a male, I am *required*, by the state, to wear something that covers up the dangly bits when I go out in public.  The state also refuses to license establishments to serve food unless those establishments have a clear policy refusing admittance to barefoot people.  Does the state require me to wear shoes, or is it their puppets the shopkeepers who do so?  Does it matter?
Shoes are also required for all riders of state-sponsored public transit.  I support the right of antisocial people to smear themselves with green jello and run naked with scissors around the block flapping their arms and shouting "splee three frooks!" if they want to, but the state does not agree.  There are also types of clothing that I am forbidden by the state to wear; I had a friend in Kansas City who cross-dressed once and got busted for -- I kid you not -- "Intent to defraud."  Since he was wearing a full beard at the time, I don't know anyone who'd have fallen for his supposed fraud, but let us just say that if you are a man dressed in women's clothing, the law enforcement agencies of a lot of places will go out of their way to find a law to charge you with.

As usual, you are confusing civil law with contract law. A contract may hold someone to penalties which are not part of civil law.  This has no effect on whether there are also penalties for something in civil law. In your example, you as owner of the car may hold people who lease your car responsible to pay *you* $100 every time they spit out the window.  If spitting out the window also happens to be illegal, then Officer Friendly can write them a ticket for it at the same time.  The state penalty is separate from the contract obligation. If you then magnanimously exempt yourself from the civil obligation
when you lease the car from yourself, Officer Friendly can still bust you for spitting out the window if you find yourself in a jurisdiction where that's illegal.  The fact that you don't (or do) also owe yourself money has no bearing on the criminal case.

Bloodhounds were for a long time considered admissible in cases involving scent tracking, and may still be in some jurisdictions -- but I don't know whether they counted as "witnesses" or "evidence". Note that courtroom procedure calls for witnesses to be sworn in, and unless someone could convince a judge that the animal understood the concept of an oath and what was being sworn, that could probably be used to disqualify any animal "witness". Other than that though, the question is not interesting except in the case of language-using animals -- presently limited to apes and chimps trained to use sign language, and a few african Gray Parrots that seem to use speech in a symbolic rather than mimicking way.  (Possibly also Dolphins and Orcas, but we're not sure yet and  translation efforts have yielded limited results at best.)
I've never heard of anyone attempting to call a language-using animal as a witness.  When it happens, there will probably be a ruling.

Honestly?  I don't think so.  Broadband is going to be planetwide in a couple of years, and massive bookstores can be found in major cities in every city on earth, or accessed remotely from anywhere if you just want to buy books.  But government encroachment is also increasing planetwide as the cost of surveillence and restriction is driven down by new technology. If you're profoundly optimistic about such things, there's a dude who has renamed himself as 'Lazarus Long' who is trying to found a nation based on strictly libertarian principles and has gotten as far as getting national sovereignty over a tiny island that has basically zero natural resources.  Personally I think it's going to be very marginal and isn't likely to last more than a dozen years -- leaving those who get mixed up in it at a risk of becoming stateless persons who may be shat upon by any government on the planet. Or you could try Nauru -- ten thousand people, more or less, on an island now ecologically ruined by mining -- but it's a republic and the citizens still have representation.  And it's English-speaking.
They are deliberately trying to cultivate an offshore-banking business, so there are opportunities for net-savvy people capable of tending server farms and caring for customer privacy there. But they may find that their close ties to Australia are strained if they take customer privacy too seriously.  The problem with Nauru is they have to import all their food except for some fish caught locally, so if they refuse to cooperate with the systematic sheepshearing of citizens globally, they are likely to find themselves hungry, or spending all their banking profits paying blockade-runners for taking insane risks.

I turned on a television set last night, for the first time in many months.  I was watching videotapes, but I caught fragments of shows while tapes were rewinding, etc.
American TV has taken a definite turn for the vicious since I last watched.  It's still pablum-and-opiates, but someone has spiked it.
We're seeing an increasing focus on elitism, "survival of the fittest", etc -- shows that present the "elimination" of the weak as a virtue, and where game-show hosts masquerading as intellectuals intentionally humiliate contestants.  We are seing a separation of moral responsibility from action and being conditioned to accept viciousness in authority figures.  We are also being conditioned to accept the idea that some form of pseudo-intellectual "correctness" excuses viciousness.
The tone is very similar to "entertainment" or "public education" films that were produced by the propaganda arm of the german National Socialist party in 1936-1938, which I remember from school but which folk in Germany, or those who attend current-day American schools, will not recognize due to censorship.  We forget history, believing that this will prevent us from repeating it rather than the other way round....
The progression was reasonably simple, as I recall. First, the people are conditioned to accept "harsh reality", survival    of the fittest, etc. Second, the people are conditioned to accept that, these things being    inevitable, hurrying them along is a virtue. Third, some class of people are identified as being "inferior" and    pseudoscience upholding the claim is advanced.  The shows I saw last night were deep into the second stage, and universal public monitoring is now more pervasive here than it was then and there, and our schools are raising a generation of people who think monitoring and draconian weapons laws are normal, and ideas not "politically correct" are being persecuted as vigorously
here as they were in Nazi Germany. The parallels continue...  The "new media must be controlled" of that era was radio and television -- now it's the internet.  Same basic debates going on -- most of the same outcomes happening.

It would, unless enough fear of these people can be spread among the general population.  If you can make the people scared enough of X (whether X is anarchists or anybody else), the people won't protest when you start killing X.  The US government, and various police forces, have used this principle extensively in the last decade or so; whenever they want license to kill X, they first demonize X in the press hoping to get lots of people scared of X.
The problem with this approach is that when a lot of people, or people whom the scared people know, have gotten killed,  people start to get scared of X where X is the police and their bosses....

Um, no.  A couple of years would have been fine a decade ago, but these days if you piss off The People Who Must Not Be Pissed Off, extradition - from anywhere you'd remotely want to be - happens really fast.  And getting faster, at least until the US sets off a backlash of sentiment among its current supporters. I guess it depends on what you're up to.  If you really want to avoid attracting their attention -- then you're not posting to this list ever again and you're *definitely* not doing anything like Phil Zimmerman and several others we could name did.  In short, you abandon cypherpunk ideas to all outward appearances and do not contribute anything to the freedom of our descendants. You just sit there like a nice little shitbag and quiver when they tell you to quiver, and they'll leave you alone.  For now.  At least until they run out of people who make them more nervous.
On the other If you *do* attract their attention, then international travel will make them even more nervous about you -- and we all know (from Bell's case) what happens when Those Who Must Not Be Pissed Off get nervous about a particular person.  A Kangaroo trial and a long sentence, natch.  Same as anywhere else in the world.
I think maybe the most effective path is a middle path; do things that help the situation of everybody, publish good subversive software if your talents run that way, and you'll definitely attract their attention.  But as far as you can avoid it, never *frighten* them....  I guarantee that if Phil Zimmerman had had an impressive collection of guns or a stockpile of chemical reagents in his posession when he released PGP, he would be rotting in jail today and the rest of us wouldn't have PGP, nor its lineal descendants.   Basically, you're allowed to piss them off a little, and they still need some kind of excuse to arrest you.  But once you've pissed them off, any excuse will do, even (as Bell's case teaches us)  the legal exercise of a constitutionally protected right. I think a lot of international travel would be more likely to give them the excuse they need to arrest you, if they were looking for one, than it would do to keep them off your back. And when you go travelling internationally, the opportunities for setups of various types multiply exponentially.  What if somebody blackbags your luggage and a pound of dope shows up
in turkish customs?  Now add in a hefty bribe to the judge in the case and your innocent ass can be sitting in jail in Turkey for decades at no PR cost to the USA.

@_subject: Digital Cash 
I've been attempting to design a decentralized auction/
exchange system that permits pseudonymous participants.  By 'decentralized', I mean that NO central server, or subset of individual servers, controls access to any resource the system cannot work without; that there is no single point of failure. A consequence of this is that every ability that exists in any node, must exist in every node.  So the whole problem of currency issue gets the slightly weird solution of "everybody has to be able to print their own money."  The sticking point is that this basically means the system will be without any single universal "currency".
A lot of E-cash techniques are usable, but what you wind up trading is certificates that represent goods or services offered by individuals in the system -- Alice the Farmer might issue certificates for bushels of wheat, while Bob the Carpenter might issue a bunch of certificates that say "collect a thousand of these and I'll redeem them for a new 10x10 meter deck on your house" and Carol the moneychanger might promise to redeem hers for one US dollar each, just for the amusement value of "redeeming" something in a system where hard currencies are the norm with a fiat currency. So these would be  effectively a sort of digital merchants scrip, reducing back down to barter.
Exchange rates between the currencies issued by different participants would fluctuate according to trust and commodity values, and I'm okay with that.  Given the nature of the trust/reputation thing, I'd expect only a very small percentage of the participants to *actually* issue their own currency, as they wouldn't get good acceptance/exchange values until widely known, but everybody would have the ability.
The problem I'm running into is that while all kinds of e-cash protocols exist that protect the anonymity of the buyer and a lot protect the anonymity of the seller, there are none that protect the anonymity of the currency issuer, which would be ideal in this circumstance.  With the techniques I know of, the issuer can have only "Nym" protection. The basic problem with anonymizing the issuers (beyond technique alone) would be how the scrip gets redeemed when you don't necessarily know whom the issuer is.

Uh, to clarify, at least in the current version of the design, the reputation system *is* insurance.  Basically in a pseudonymous
situation, the only kind of reputation system that could possibly matter is where the person providing the reputation certificates does so by offering to bet real money on someone's good behavior
at easy odds.  Otherwise you can just spoof the system with tentacle reputation agents that all recommend you (and each other).
So, when alice-the-buyer wants some assurances that bob-the-seller won't rip her off, she goes to Carol-the-reputation-agent and says "What are the odds on Bob reneging in a five-hundred-buck deal?"  And Carol's response is something like "I'll bet Bob does you a straight deal, five-hundred-to-one."  Alice considers the rate and decides she wants insurance,  pays Carol a buck for a "marker" to use in the contract, does a five-hundred-buck deal with bob (man, that's a lot of venison) and if Bob reneges, Alice gets to cash in Carol's five-hundred-buck marker - thus getting her money back.  Carol instantly warns every other reputation agent in the system about Bob and how he reneged for five hundred bucks -- so that Nym is effectively trashed.   If Bob doesn't renege, Carol makes a buck.
Anyway; whether you call Carol a bookie or an insurance dealer is entirely negotiable.  But in this scheme your "reputation" means neither more nor less than the cheapest insurance rates someone can get if they try to insure themselves against you reneging.

I keep looking at the whole stego thing.  But the basic problem remains the same.  Stego relies on the *method* being secret, which stands in stark contrast to kerchoff's principle.  I mean, sure, you can stego encrypted stuff so nobody who recovers it can read it, but if you use any of the "available" programs, there will always be utilities that can detect your encrypted stuff and, usually, extract it.
In a proper stego system, the stegotext must be *undetectable* by people who don't have the key -- even if they have the stego program used.  I don't know of any which meet that criteria.  For one thing they mostly work on lowest-significant-bits and leave the rest of the carrier text alone.  It's pretty simple to detect that the LSB's have increased entropy, or represent inconsistent gradients of color on the smallest scales. One thing that is an absolute dead giveaway, and I see a lot of stegograms out there that have this built in, is that in graphic files, the number of pixels is increased by interpolation, either in the digital camera/scanner, or after the image is made by a graphics editor, before the steganography is done.  The problem with this is that interpolation is done by highly predictable algorithms which dictate the relationships of each pixel (including the LSB) to its neighbors.  When you take this regular system of linear-equations-with-a-simultaneous-solution and then impose your stegotext on it, it stands out like a sore thumb.
*sigh*.  I will not use a stego system unless I write it first and my recipient has the only other copy.   Because it's a matter of keeping the *method* secret, that's really the only way.

Illegal "sweetheart deals" that have been worked out with police officials and/or private security whereby they've pretty much agreed in advance that if Adobe puts out the right codeword, a bunch of muscular men in riot gear will show up to HURT the "attackers" - this could involve the deployment of tear gas or pepper spray.

But then, the information content of what comes out of the mouth of someone who's just hit his/her thumb with a hammer is pretty low, too. It doesn't mean s/he doesn't have a real concern. This is just a guess, but what *I* think motivates these people is frustration and disenfranchisement.  It's not that any substantial group of them want any particular thing, it's just that the whole bunch of them feel that they don't have a voice in what's happening any more.  The "globalization" people are consulting *each other* instead of the people affected by the laws to figure out what laws they should pass, and the people are pissed off because they don't feel that they have any input into the process.  Also, the personal pressure on them is a little higher every year as the forces of capitalism get more ruthless and efficient at exploiting them as a market and as cheap labor - and the barriers to actually starting a business of one's own seem to be going nowhere but up - so they're also frustrated by the fact that even though they may be making more money, they're still working for other people and at the end of the day they're still poorer.  Capitalism from the worker's perspective means working longer hours, getting paid more, and winding up under family pressure (because your family is an intensely and effectively targeted market) to spend it all on stupid stuff.  Furbys, TV's, and barbie dolls, for god's sake. So at the end of the day they have more stupid crap but they're poorer and more tired and have less time to spend with their family - and after a while they get frustrated. But none, or few, of them see it in exactly those terms. They're just angry and frustrated and they don't really know why.  The few issues they believe in are getting ignored, so they go protest about those few issues and it turns into a chaotic mess because everybody has different issues and different degrees of how pissed-

It gets a little stifling when people can't or don't control how much pressure (as advertising etc) they are exposed to.
Let's put it this way; why would a rational person or even a sane person purchase a furby?  It is useless; it is annoying; its expected lifespan is under five weeks; your kids will be unhappy when (not if) it breaks; and its price exceeds that of two good meals at a nice restaurant.  I maintain that people buy furbys (and most other "fad" items) because of pressure and false expectations raised by carefully-
designed advertising, and then fall into inevitable disappointment with the real item.  In short, they are acting irrationally, and have given people a vested interest in maintaining their lack of mental health.
I believe in capitalism where it meets real needs; where rational buyers meet rational sellers, where the customers know what they're buying and will in fact be well-served by it, I am delighted to be part of the transaction.  But the science of marketing is increasingly about arresting the processes of rational thought, and even the processes of mental health, in order to induce people to buy crap which they don't need, won't or can't use, or can't get any real satisfaction from.  Sometimes I wish I could grab people and shake them and yell, "no, the car will not come equipped with a bikini model.  Make your decision about the car, not about the woman..."  It's not *explicit* deception.  But I believe that the marketer today, and particularly the marketer in posession of personal information, unfairly distorts people's perceptions to a point where the average consumer is no longer an equal rational agent in financial transactions.  People are buying things that they later regret buying.
On the one hand, you can call it "survival pressure" and hope that the next generation will be smarter.  On the other hand, it's just one more example of the kind of things that make life suck if you're on the recieving end.  And on the gripping hand, it's why some of us are concerned about the use of private information by marketers.  This is why people feel exploited by "capitalism", giving rise to some of the "anti-capitalist" rhetoric that's come out of the protests.

But I had to just stop listening, because it made me angry day after Self-discipline in an arms race with techniques designed to suppress or defeat it, yes.  And that's only on the personal level.  On the personal level, I'm now pretty insulated from most marketing campaigns, so that's not all that relevant to me.  However, the societal effects are nasty, because the *widespread* suppression of self-discipline leads to a lot of stupid, wasteful, or harmful effects that are very widespread, and which I can't get away from.

'Mommy's not home for dinner, sweety, because she's working overtime to buy you a furby.... she's on the fucking treadmill, and you helped put her there.  Want some pie?'
You are correct; and therefore, it is in the best interests of marketers to make sure that everything is as banal and bland as possible, and that all the ideas are prepackaged - specifically in order to prevent people from growing up emotionally, or becoming rational.  They're doing an increasingly effective job of it and whether we're directly included/affected ourselves or not, whether we are consumerist zombies or critical-thinking adults, we have to live in the sick society that results from their handiwork.
Yes, it has.
Trust me on this; it will be. Men known to be gay are already getting car adverts featuring leather-clad men instead of the customary bikini babes, and offered accessories like rainbow stickers direct from the dealers.  From here out, it's only a matter of refinement.  Ultimately, if the car dealers find out enough, the question is only about whether the marginal sales to people who like busty oriental babes in red PVC underwear will pay for the photo shoot, ad composition, and printing costs.  Digital imaging and "poser" software drives down the cost of the first, Expert Systems are driving down the cost of the second, and printing costs are already pretty damn minor. With the result that practically *every* ad you see causes pressure, because all the ones that wouldn't get an ROI (which wouldn't cause pressure) are elsewhere.  The total pressure on each and every consumer has dramatically increased.

It would take a *lot* to alienate Adobe's customers on a substantial enough basis to affect Adobe.  Most of them probably haven't even heard about this debacle and if they did, wouldn't care. But Adobe has one other check on its behavior -- it lives in the valley and *HAS TO* attract really bright geeks to work there.  Really bright geeks have probably heard about this and are angry about it.  This will hurt them in recruiting, and (unconfirmed rumor) maybe it has already cost them somebody they can't replace.
Truly brilliant coders are different from normal people. They have something like a THOUSAND times the productivity of the merely competent professional and command only about three times the salary (Well, at least until they start their own companies, which about half of them eventually do).  There is no other industry where three orders of magnitude separate the pros from the truly brilliant. Needless to say, brilliant coders can work wherever they damn well want, and I hear (unconfirmed) that one such individual has jumped ship from Adobe (or threatened to) over this.  I'm still trying to confirm it, and if so, find out exactly who.
Adobe's fine on the consumption side -- it's customers, as you say, are fat and happy.  But on the production side, Adobe can't take very many really serious hits.  At best, it only ever had about five truly brilliant coders at any one time, and in this industry there is just no making up for losing one.  If it turns out to be true, their productivity is damaged for years to come.

@_subject: Possible Internet Split (plan D) 
These are a bunch of people who want to make fundamental architectural changes to the internet, to make it so they can prevent people from getting services unless they are paid money.  Oddly enough, this comes at a time when I've been thinking very seriously about some of the implications of "Plan D."  Basically, we need to think very hard about the infrastructure, if we intend to build something that is truly censorship-proof (as opposed to merely content-neutral). Mojo nation and freenet are current appoximations, but they work over the Internet, and that may be their downfall.
The problem with Plan D, if implemented over the current Internet, is that the low levels of the internet are a tree rather than a proper network.  There are choke points and listening points at which all of a particular person's traffic can be guaranteed to be intercepted.  Every packet that traverses the internet can be queried to see where it's going, where it came from, how many hops it has left to live, etc.  Most are associated with particular applications, and easily identifiable by a port number contained in the packet headers.  Encrypted traffic stands out.  Mixes are complicated by the absence of true broadcast (radio, ethernet in promiscuous mode, anything...) anywhere in the infrastructure, with the result that while you may not be able to tell which of the Mixers are responsible for a particular packet, but you can damn sure tell who the Mixers are, and if the Mix becomes enough of a problem you can outlaw it and stomp anybody who traffics in its characteristic packets. Every "solution" to these problems requires identifiable nodes to traffic in detectable types of packets over an increasingly monitored and controlled infrastructure. And the business types, as well as the pols, who haven't been able to cope with the internet's chaotic nature, want the infrastructure *more* monitored and *more* controlled.  Since these are the groups that have the money and the power, respectively, they *will* get their way.  Most cypherpunkish "dream" applications don't stand a chance of actually surviving full-out censorship and the descendants of the DMCA, in this network or the network that these people want to build.
So, while these guys want to make the Internet into some kind of centrally-controlled monopoly, I've been wanting to create something that goes completely the other direction -- a "chaos web" with its own routing and switching and content-migration algorithms, designed specifically to facilitate the desire of some or all nodes and operators to remain impenetrable, uncensorable, and content-unlinkable to any unauthorized listener or would-be spoofer, regardless of the resources (including government) the would-be attacker has available. Characteristics of a "chaos web" include mobile content -- an idea already espoused by mojo nation and freenet -- but that means you can't hook up the database servers on the other end of your website and monitor where the people go, so mainstream businesses will probably not use a chaos web. ultimately though, it comes down to some kind of alternate infrastructure.

I have two brothers.  Early in their college career, one of them got drunk, and for the sheer hell of it started bowling overhand.  The manager of the lanes at the student union was disinclined to try kicking him out personally, so he called my other brother to come get him out...  This was possible because at that time all three of us had a lot of experience chucking large heavy objects (and the arms/shoulders to prove it) because we had been operating a firewood business to pay for If you can get a grip on a large, heavy object which is long (like a chunk of a log, or a fire extinguisher) You can often throw it further and harder one-handed and underhand than you can two-handed and sideways, because the swing gets the far end going a lot faster and that translates into a lot of power for the throw.  You can also throw the sucker overhand, but you have to start by lifting it high in front of you, then swinging it down, turning sideways, bringing it up behind you, and releasing it over your head - as my brother discovered he could do with bowling balls. This guy holding up the fire extinguisher two handed, on the other hand, looks like he was intent on using it for a battering ram -- to push in someone's face with it or something. He didn't have room for the big underhand swing, nor the full-circle followed by overhand release, nor even really for the sideways chuck. One thing that his arms and posture suggest to me is that it's actually lighter than you've been guessing -- if it were heavy I'd expect to see a little more tension.  Perhaps it was already discharged, thus only about 5-7 pounds?

My reading of these paragraphs is that basically, you don't start out by releasing a program that script kiddies can download and use to break stuff.  You can present your paper at defcon, as long as there's not an executable.  You can create an executable, with source code, package it up and send it to the copyright owner with a note that says "your protection is broken: here's the proof."
You can shout at the top of your lungs that their crypto is broken, on all kinds of forums. You can engage in your right to fair use using your own executable, ie, taking a five-second clip and using it in an original work where it's seen in the background as your protagonists stroll by arguing about the new sushi restaurant. But what it looks like is, you cannot publish that executable, nor make it possible for anybody else to engage in their right to fair Something may appear in an anonymous channel, and if it's not traceable to you -- or downloadable from your website, etc -- then they may sue you for having done the research that made it possible, but they will lose.

Consider the DMCA (US law) as compared to the Terrorism Act of 2000 (UK law).  Both make it effectively illegal for ordinary citizens to own, use, or distribute any software capable of performing decrypts by exploiting a weak cryptographic system. The US and UK, not coincidentally, are the two governments with the largest known investments in SIGINT -- the famous Echelon System. If people started using strong cryptographic systems, Echelon would be effectively useless.  Therefore it is in the best interests of these two governments to make weak cryptographic systems the norm insofar as they are able. This is possible by providing an additional layer of legal protection to users of weak cryptographic systems -- with software capable of exploiting such weaknesses effectively illegal to own or use, the developers of such products have drastically reduced incentive to develop strong cryptographic systems to replace them. The DMCA and the Terrorism Act appear to provide exactly such laws. What has been passed recently by the other signatories to the UKUSA agreement that created Echelon?

Oh, please, let's not get into specious crap. I'm totally familiar with the concept that "source code" is considered by some to be a gray area.  To me, the distinction is relatively clear.  Source code is what enables someone to do X whether or not they understand X.  You don't have to understand the weaknesses in a cryptosystem to correct a few syntax errors, figure out what standard libraries to include, or do a conversion between different forms of the source with a perl script.  I mean, the code could *help* you understand it, if you were inclined to read it for content -- but if you can get it working without understanding what it does, it probably violates the law.
Communication, on the other hand, is what enables someone to *understand* X.   And yes, a lot of people, myself included, can and do use source code to communicate ideas.  Does it piss me off that this mode of communication is made unavailable by this law? Yes.  Am I stupid enough to not figure out what the law means?  Dmitri released an executable *before* he had the excuse of being required to produce it as evidence.  Plus he's a foreign national on US soil, whose government is willing to be anally raped with a two-by-four if they think it will get them more US financial aid.  They have evidently left him twisting in the wind.  That is not a position of strength.

Oddly, I've been watching this one with some interest. The other day I got worried about potential disk drive crashes, since with one thing and another I'm starting to accumulate a lot of unreleased original source code on my main machine. After the work I've put into it, I'd hate to lose it.  But it's not an application that does anything useful yet.
It would be handy, from my point of view, to use usenet as an "offsite backup" solution -- posting encrypted source for work-in-progress on binary newsgroups so I could just go back and nab it out of the archives if I ever have a disk crash or in case the computer gets stolen.
If I want to increase the odds of its getting archived, I would just embed it in a sound file or a movie file using stego (original sound and movies, so as to avoid DMCA hassles, of course). Stegograms present an interesting copyright question for the legally inclined; if I'm using usenet archives as offsite backup via stegograms, I'm okay with the release and public use of the stegogram, which most folks will interpret as being the same as the covertext.  But would that entangle the copyright on the stegotext as well?  Or if somebody took the stegogram and figured it out, would I have legal recourse
to stop them from doing anything with my code?
(I was considering going to a lawyer with this one, but since the odds against anyone hacking the password on the encrypted data in the stegotext are literally astronomical, I figure the point is sufficiently moot to be not worth answering except as an intellectual curiosity.)

It says that "circumvention devices" are illegal, and the opinion of the court is that code -- source *or* executable -- is a "device".  At the same time, it says that other information, which promotes *understanding*, but which is not a "device", is legal. At least for now.

That's not wrong per se, as it's not stealing or coercion -- it's just rude.  But scans themselves are perfectly acceptable and necessary as the only reliable means of providing this service.

This is not quite true.  Search on their site for the acronym "PXE" -- it stands for "Preboot eXtension Environment".  I went and hunted on Pheonix's website and came across some interesting things:  Aside from the preboot extension environment, which allows apps made by pheonix to run on your hardware before an operating system loads or in the absence of a functioning OS, there is a remote-boot facility, a capability for remote lockout of input from the local user, acess to the machine hardware (including disks, by physical sector and track addressing), etc.  They claim it's part of an "Intel's initiative" to make machines "Universally Manageable and Universally Managed."
Most of this crap appears to require access to the local ethernet to perform -- it's not a TCP/IP issue until someone uses TCP/IP to subvert another machine on the same local ethernet segment - but from there it looks like they can pretty much do whatever the hell they want with a machine, including remotely flashing the BIOS with new applications for the preboot environment - meaning if they figure out that you're running linux filesystems, they can just change their sector accesses to compensate and get into your files with a preboot extension.  Slick, huh?  Or they can remotely install an operating system of their choice over the network.
Relevant search phrases to turn up a lot of scary shit: "Universally manageable and Universally managed".

It would take about two days to build this device, cost under $1500, and the driver is so dead-simple it's probably no effort at all to port, but allocate another day of work for that.  After that it's just a matter of dumping the info to the hard drive and writing a script to phone home once in a while.

So, there was a board meeting, and some board members and major investors waxed wroth.  Odds are, the drive got wiped within hours of being swiped.  Odds are, the laptop is sitting somewhere in a pawnshop and the damage to the company has been limited to the cost of a single laptop computer.  But slightly longer odds have a much MUCH higher cost to the company: if the mugger realized what the hell he had in his hands, he could match my annual salary by selling it to one of our competitors.  If the mugger was hired in the first place by one of our competitors, then... that's not good either.  And of course, if he's willing to face a bit dicier risk profiles, and has criminal confederates inside some Fortune 500 companies, he
can track our sales and marketing force, and try to undercut us with pirate versions of our software and potentially cost us millions in sales. These are in order of decreasing probability, and the last, while only very remotely likely, is pretty disturbing.
And I was sitting there, listening to all the worst-case scenarios, and thinking, "Damn, I wish we had laptops with solidly encrypted hard drives."  Enter the key, boot the machine.  Wrong key, hard drive appears to be full of random garbage. Encryption handled in the BIOS.
The BIOS password protection is garbage for protecting hard drive contents - the hard drives are unencrypted and can just be popped out and stuck into a different laptop of the same model.

@_subject: Shooting down 'Bandit Satellites' 
Assuming the can-sat were in low earth orbit, yes, they could easily shoot it down.  The air force has a few extreme high-altitude craft that can launch long-range missiles.  These can actually reach the same altitude or nearly, as low-earth-orbit satellites.  (They cannot reach low earth orbit; that would require them to be at that altitude but going much much faster.)
They can't launch a missile fast enough to get low earth orbit, either -- but in the final analysis, it doesn't really matter whether the satellite hits the missile or the missile hits the satellite.  if you're getting one bandit-sat per launch, then the answer is plainly no.  Because the missiles or planes don't have to reach orbital velocity at all, they are much cheaper to shoot down than to put up. However, if you get a thousand bandit-sats per launch, and they scatter all over the sky once they're up there, it becomes much more viable.  It could take weeks or months to shoot them all down, and since they wouldn't be clumped together you'd have to fly a separate mission for every one of them.  In that scenario they are cheaper to launch than to shoot down.  But still, the launch costs would be a substantial fraction of the shootdown costs, and unless you can spend a substantial fraction of what the US government would be willing to spend on it, I think that's cold comfort at best.
If you go for higher orbits, we might get to see some of the stuff the "star wars" research paid for...  At the very least, I'm betting on a satellite with a laser which, given a few minutes at a hundred-kilometer range, could probably burn through a can-sat.  Probably something faster than that.  Possibly a bunch of can-sats with "intercept and collide" or "get close and explode" missions. depends on how tightly focused.  If you're using radio, you cannot focus that tightly, and yes your signal to the satellite can be traced.  If you're using laser, it would require them to have a satellite with some appropriate directional sensor within a few degrees of the satellite.  Hmm, as I think about it, unless your laser doesn't illuminate dust in the atmosphere, it might not require that much to detect it after all.
Interesting question.  If the film capsule is tiny, nonmetallic, and contains no radio equipment, it might be possible for it not to show up on radar, in which case it's much less detectable than radio etc.

"So anyway, I've been tripping around at lightspeed, and it's been about six centuries local time since I set foot here, but when I went back to the merchant square this chador greets me by name.
How long do they live, anyhow?"
"Well, that's an interesting question.  We've done the DNA Analysis..."
"They don't use DNA.  They've got some kind of lattice molecule."
"The title of the Biosurvey report for checking whatever mechanism they use to pass on genetic information, is DNA Analysis."
"Okay... but it's misleading terminology." "Anyway, according to the DNA Analysis, an individual chador only ought to live about a hundred fifty years standard..."
"Only!  That's thirty years longer than humans!"
"Captain, let me finish a sentence or two, okay?" "Sorry, go ahead." "Anyway, even though the lifespan is about a hundred fifty years, their history records actions by individuals that apparently lived for thousands of years."  "Is this that bizarre religion of theirs?  With the masks passed from one generation to the next and whoever wears the mask being considered to be a particular person?"
"Partly.  But it turns out that's not just a religion."
"What do you mean?" "We thought it was religious at first, but it turns out that the chador pheremonal system is very complex.  In fact, those scent glands
below each eye produce tailored molecules in response to almost all sense impressions.  This is the basis of animal communications on their homeworld.  But it's not very discriminatory. Basically, the scent glands will tell another chador anything that one chador knows or actively remembers, whether or not they want the other one to know.  Learning to use those masks to cover the scent glands, so as *not* to communicate everything indiscriminately, was the pivotal point of chador civilization, the same way human civilization took off when we learned to use language.  Eventually, they developed their  own language, so that they could communicate as they chose without removing their masks and communicating everything.  The religion, the whole 'I am the masks I wear' thing, came after."
"What's that got to do with the chador I saw this afternoon greeting me by name?" "He was wearing the same mask that the chador who saw you six centuries ago was wearing."
"Huh?"  "The masks.  Sense impressions get written into them as chemical traces from the pheremones.  The chador who's wearing the mask today can "read" the pheremones, and therefore the sense impressions,
of the chador who was wearing it six centuries ago."
"Six century old pheremones?  That encode my *face*?"  "It must be a very good mask. The cheap ones they sell tourists are just toys. The primitive ones that are handmade out of natural materials by backwoods savages on their homeworld are good for a year or so.  The modern ones that most chadors in the street are wearing for the last thousand years or so, will preserve about forty years, so that a chador can have the benefit of knowing some of the stuff his or her parents experienced.  But the really good ones - the ones that a few very wealthy chadors can afford to have made - can be filled with almost eight centuries of sensory memories.  I'd wager that your merchant friend had a very wealthy ancestor."
"No bet.  The lens for the center eye looked like it was carved out of a great big ruby.  So, is there effectively any difference between chadors?  Do they have individual identities beyond those masks?"
"There is.  But there's not.  The chador you saw today was not the same person the chador you saw those many years ago was.  But he has that earlier chador's memories - at least the ones experienced while wearing that mask - available to him just about as easily as his own.  Under their law, he accepted all the contracts and agreements and property of the mask when he accepted the mask, so legally he is the same person.  But he didn't get that mask when he was born.  He had a childhood and an adolescence where he wore his own mask, and developed his own personality, and he is a different person.  If the mask was his father's, he probably wore some other family mask for a long time as an adult before he inherited it.  But, it may have been his grandfather's or great-grandfather's, presented to him when he reached maturity shortly after the patriarch passed on.  It's just like you - you have your ship's log, and you can read what the previous owner of the ship got up to on any particular day.  Under some legal codes, you'd even be liable for crimes your ship's been involved with before you got it - but you're not that person. "
"So he's worn other masks during his life."
"At least one.  Probably still wears them from time to time, when he doesn't want to be the merchant." "So he puts on a different mask, and he's somebody else."
"According to the rules of their society, yes." "A mask that contains all your childhood memories.  Wow, I'd like to have one of those."  "You must have had a happier childhood than I, captain." "Um, sorry."  "Not your fault.  Anyway, most chador languages have a lot of different pronouns that we humans translate as 'I' or 'we'.  The nuances of meaning, in a culture where everybody has several distinct identies, are lost on us."
"Wow.  I'll bet crime and punishment is way different." "Yeah.  Usually, whoever committed a really heinous crime just puts the mask away and never puts it on again. Effectively, the criminal ceases to exist. "
"But eventually the police find the mask, right?  I mean, if the chador's memories are all in there, then that's it." "The police find the masks sometimes, but they can't touch 'em.  For one chador to put on another's mask is a crime -- identity fraud and rape rolled into one.  While there are sensationalized cases about chadors working for secret police in some of the more backward and oppressive nation-states doing that, it's considered an atrocity.  Their equivalent of the UN considers it a crime against humanity.  Chadority.  Whatever." "And eventually their children inherit these masks?"  "And sometimes they publicly recite the crimes recorded therein, to exonerate the wrongly convicted. And sometimes they take one whiff of the mask and refuse it.  Usually, they find it uplifting, but once in a while - There was a sensational case a couple months ago, where a young female chador inherited one of her father's masks - but the first time she put it on, she shrieked, ripped it off again, and threw it into a fire.  Turns out there were two masks that looked the same, but one of them was used for legal business and one was used for.... well, we don't know.  She won't talk about it."
"But you have your suspicions."  "I do indeed."  "Hmmm."  "They are a race very different from ourselves, captain."
"Not so different as you might imagine, Lieutenant.  We all wear our masks from time to time.  Thanks for the information on chadors, I don't think I really understood them before." "You imagine you really understand them now?"
"A little, anyway."
The Captain walked out of the BioSurvey office and down the street, musing....  he had fifty names on twenty worlds, and the tangled histories stretched nine centuries of relativity-compressed time behind him.  At last, he thought, a client who can really understand me.
"Good evening, Captain Abrams."  The voice came from the shadows. "Good evening, Muk'kelaama.  I shall only be Captain Abrams again for tonight, for you and Captain Abrams have business to discuss."
"Muk'kelaama is also, most of the time, not."  The translator had bobbled, but the idea was clear enough.
"Are you still interested in the items you wished to purchase last time we saw each other, Muk'kelaama?" "The persistence of ancestors' memories makes our culture slow to change," said Muk'kelaama, as though talking to itself. "I understand."  Muk'kelaama held out a small box. Captain Abrams looked inside, and found it filled with rubies. Gorgeous, flawless, perfect rubies the size of a fist. Later that night a stealth shuttle dropped silently from the sky in an out-of-the-way spot far from the city.  Its stark lines and composites defied radar, and its matte black finish defied lidar. It flew like a brick with wings, but what the hell.  Dropping vertically onto its g-thrusters in a grassy meadow, it popped the hatch as soon as it hit the ground - the hell with safety regs and clearance - and immediately six chadors of military bearing materialized around the edge of the clearing and converged on the spot.  Quickly, they began unloading crate after crate of munitions.  Captain Abrams and Muk'kelama looked on, silently eyeing each other, each wary for some last minute trick or trap. Finally, the cargo lay upon the ground, and Captain Abrams raised one hand to Muk'kelaama, closed in the fist of a revolutionary salute the other might recognize from six centuries ago.  "Good luck," he said.  The door popped closed and the ship silently fell into the sky, its perfectly tuned g-thrusters making no sound at all. Muk'kelaama turned and found its general at its elbow, breathing hard behind its mask.  "With this much, sir, we can wipe out entire cities!  The revolution lives!"

It's the same law as the law regarding duplication of in-print books/other works.  There are places and situations in which the enforcement varies depending on whether it's out of print, but in the US anyway, it's the same law. Yep, you would still be violating copyright, including the DMCA. You can quote from it, subject to the rules on fair use - but you can't reproduce the whole of it.  However, if the text of the book is submitted as evidence, in a civil or criminal trial, there are some different rules that apply. I recall a circumstance in which a reporter for the Topeka newspaper, while on vacation on his own nickel, researched a story on a local foaming-at-the-mouth minister named Fred Phelps, going to Phelps' hometown and interviewing people who'd known him as a kid etc.  He then wrote an article and handed it to his editor at work, at the Topeka Capitol Journal.  As it turns out though, when the Journal had changed ownership a year or so earlier, Phelps and his goons had started picketing the owner's house.  Loudly and continuously, until they started getting good press. The owner, effectively in Phelps' pocket, quashed the story.
The reporter notified them that he intended to publish an article using the research he'd done for the quashed article elsewhere, and the newspaper (acting more or less on orders from Phelps' goons)  sued to stop him.  The reporter entered the text of the submitted article as Exhibit A in the lawsuit, and the research he'd done as Exhibit B. His case was to show that the article he intended to publish elsewhere used different parts of his research than the article that the Capitol Journal had refused to publish. But when it was submitted as evidence, it became public information and went out on the internet within two I don't remember whether he won or lost the suit.  But it seemed kind of moot after that.

@_subject: Vox Populi & Governments 
These tactics are as valid today as they were when Niccolo Machiavelli first set them down on paper.  Why should we expect that they will become ineffective any time soon? I had hoped that the internet would change the dynamics of the vox populi, by allowing people unintermediated discussion with one another, the space to develop ideas fully and learn that they were not alone in holding particular ideas.  I had hoped that the Internet would stop the ancient tactic of isolating and ostracizing those who think differently, and allow them to create forums of their own and try to evolve some kind of interacting functional cultures together that incorporated their different ideas, providing a huge set of alternatives to the prozac culture.
Somehow, it all seems to have gone to shit.  Advertisers have infiltrated every corner of the web, and people who think differently are being drowned out almost as effectively there as they are on television.  Censorship is running rampant, and tolerance is at about the lowest ebb it's been in my lifetime.  The "mosaic culture" that the internet was supposed to enable keeps having bits of it cut off, and the new cultures that people who shared different ideas were once building have fallen victim to the same stupid FUD tactics and divisive tactics and agents provocateurs and crap that have been used against similar groups in meatspace since Machiavelli's time.  Well, to be honest, since before that.  He was just writing about established practice.
It is not, evidently, possible to enable public participation without giving the majority the tools to engage in a tyranny over the minority.  Julf was forced to roll over to the scientologists. Countless ISP's who've allowed "anonymous" customers to put up web sites have been forced to roll over when some LEA put kid porn up on their servers. Even Freenet is subject to this attack; if it gets too big for the lions to be comfortable with, they'll just put a whole bunch of illegal crap on it (copyrighted software and kid porn for starters) and then have it shut down (by making it illegal to run, monitoring networks for freenet packets, etc).  If they make the legal exposure bad enough, they can keep the number of people using it so tiny that it's worthless.
I dunno any more.  I used to think that if I could create things that made it possible for people to communicate, we would eventually find out what Earth's people (as opposed to its governments) wanted -- that governments would have to respond to vox populi instead of dictating it.  Now, with the crap I've seen in the last year, it just doesn't seem worth it.  The Internet Pedophile scare is obviously orchestrated, ditto the Internet Terrorist scare.  The nation states are dictating vox populi again, instead of the other way around, and the last american presidential election was a sick joke.  In the only remaining superpower on Earth, We've got a thief as head of state, a crook in the DOJ,  and the supreme court is nothing but a bunch of rubberstamp conservatives.  Despite all my best efforts, and the best efforts of hundreds or even thousands of others, there seems to be no way to give the people their own voice any more.  No matter what we do, these (untranslatable) are taking it over.
There's a point at which the futility of it becomes overwhelming, and I just want to start pitching bombs or something.  A visceral emotinal release of the frustration, if nothing else.  And I bet that's why terrorism is on the rise; there's less and less of a way to work within the bounds, so frustrated people are being driven outside them. But if I did that, of course it would be just digested into pap for the masses and used as an excuse to outlaw everything I believe in.  And I won't allow myself to be used in that way if I can possibly help it. So there's going to be no bomb-throwing for me, much as I sometimes think I'd enjoy it. All I ever really wanted was governments based on the will of the people.  But it turns out the people have no will and the governments can tell them that their will is whatever the hell the governments want it to be.

"Fairness" is such a slippery word.  Is it fair for a child to have no support available?  Remember, it's not because of anything the child did.

This one I don't hang with.  Your spouse is presumably an adult, and ought to be able to cope with not getting the estate.  But that certainly doesn't stop it from being a serious shitheel type maneuver to leave your spouse in the lurch when you go, and since you're dead at that point you don't really have that much of a compelling interest in the estate any more...

Right now, attempts to control the internet lean on ISP's and backbone sites pretty heavily.  Most of the nodes on the internet have exactly ONE route to the internet, and if you can get to somebody's upstream, she's toast. In the long run, I don't think the machinery of freedom is going to work very well until most of the nodes on the internet have at least three or four different routes to the internet.  One person connected to one ISP is easy to monitor, easy to interfere with.  But if a dozen people connected to a dozen ISP's are also all connected to each other directly, then each and every one of them becomes much harder to interfere with. Unfortunately, extra phone lines and nailed-up connections cost money, and at that point they'd just start going for the phone companies instead of the ISP's anyway.  The benefit is that  common carrier anti-censorship laws might be a little stronger with phone lines.

I've looked at that, but I'm unsure about it...  the problem is that if not enough people have it you're out of range - but if too many people have it, you're choked for bandwidth and get interference problems.  With a range of a few hundred feet to a few miles, routing can also become problematic. It would be nice though: a $100 'packet box' for each station, that allows you to set up independent IP connections with your neighbors. If you can get them common enough, it would be impossible to cut someone off by cutting their ISP access -- 'cause out in the wild, a packet is a packet is a packet, and if all the stations run IP protocol, even if every ISP in the world rejects a packet, it could still make its way across any continent in short hops from station to station. And this is not just an anti-censorship thing, either; this is more properly a tool for 24/7 uptime for people who can't afford t3's and can't get PacBell's attention to fix their damn line in the first minute after it goes down. I can picture that sales pitch appealing to a lot of home businesses who get cut off from their DSL connection for a week at a time while PacBell pulls its head out of its collective ass.

As I get more accustomed to living in close proximity to many others (urban vs. rural) I'm mellowing in this opinion a little bit.  It's easy for a rural kid to accept that stupid people get themselves killed -- I'm accustomed to thinking of guns as just one more tool that a rancher needs to keep the numbers of predators down so s/he can raise stock, and of course farm machinery is all over the place.  But guns, farm machinery, etc, take a really heavy toll on idiots and the careless, and that's just the way the world works.
But in the city, you can die because someone *else* is being stupid, and that's a lot harder to accept.  Also, in a city, there are a lot fewer non-stupid uses for guns.  So now at least I see the point of some of these laws, even if I still don't agree with them. It's the old argument about being free enough to make our own mistakes -- with guns, or otherwise.  I prefer it to most of the alternatives. On a faintly related note, every time I ride BART (the subway to new yorkers; the metro to europeans), I hear the recorded safety announcements and I'm vaguely horrified that there are apparently
people out there, still alive and most likely capable of breeding, who are so stupid they have to be warned not to lick the third rail....

I'm missing something here.  How is it even possible for an anonymous plaintiff to show defamation?  Defamation is identity-linked.
Hrm.  Okay, "related case" - so this company isn't actually anonymous, it's pseudonymous.  Still, unless they've got reputation capital in the pseudonym (and it doesn't sound like they do), defamation against it just doesn't scan. Duh.  They expected him to betray trust, I suppose?
Hmmm.  I'm not a lawyer, but I think that's over-broad.  I'd agree with an anonymous plaintiff having no subpeona power in a *defamation* case, because until the identity is known the crime cannot be assessed.  But this reads like they intend for this test to apply in *all* cases, and that's probably not right.  Also, this sounds more like a pseudonymous plaintiff than an anonymous one, and there *is* such a thing as defamation against a pseudonym. Also, there's a real question here.  Say I've got a pseudonym such as my unsigned PGP key, and I've been using it for years.  Now someone says "messages signed by this key are from a child molesting sodomite." On the one hand, there's a defamation case because the pseudonym's value is reduced.  It loses a lot of reputation capital.  On the other hand, if I now step forward and say "Excuse me, that's my key and I never molested a child in my life -- and I've also never been to the mideast, let alone the city of Sodom...", my identity is linked to the pseudonym, which damages its value further.  Also, I may suffer "extraordinary harm" as a result -- there still being people here and there who think stoning anyone suspected of child molesting is better than finding out whether it's actually true.  The precedent seems to indicate that a pseudonym cannot be defended
under the law.  It can only be destroyed.
The wording of the decision seems to indicate that the judge does not understand the difference between anonymity and pseudonymity.

@_subject: Did you notice 
This is true.  There's a huge disparity between what I see now and what I saw when I was really poor and had no degree.
I can't say that for sure...  I have had a friend from high school killed in what was later called an accident in a court of law.  But I think it's at least fifty percent likely that the court was wrong, or applying the standard of a "reasonable doubt" in a case where there wasn't enough solid evidence for a conviction.  But I have had several people I've been close to die for some reason other than natural causes.  Mostly they just made mistakes with heavy machinery.  Mistakes with guns, by contrast, are mostly non-
fatal. People who did that blew off a few toes or messed up a hand or got some birdshot in their leg off a ricochet or something. Note that reputation is alive in that society; if it becomes known that you have made mistakes with guns, you are likely to find that no one wants to be your friend because you're likely to die or kill one of your friends accidentally. So it is often regarded as a shameful secret, and often people with minor gun wounds (such as a few pellets of birdshot from a ricochet) don't seek treatment for fear of the embarassment.
As Peter says, now that I live in the world of "educated professionals" such things simply don't happen to the people I know today. In a grim fascinating way, it's just efficient use of human lives
as a resource in capital production.  Those who have the money, and
hence the power, are the ones who've most efficiently used their lives to produce capital. Most of them have made most of their production by causing others to be marginally more efficient under their management, but the principle is sound. They are protected, reflexively, by the organism of a human society and the very 'human nature' that you just mentioned.  If they were not so protected, we would probably
be a lot less efficient at producing functioning societies.  This is because we can't afford the loss of those who understand how to produce capital.  And we can't afford to protect all people as well as that group is protected. I do not claim that this is good, but as the pygmies say, "Eyali djamba.  Njamba, eyaliboye."  Roughly translated, "That's the jungle.  That's the way it is." And folks, the poor people, the ones who stop to think about it anyway, they know the score.  They know that nobody's going to have heads of state come to their funerals, or write books about what they have to say, or erect monuments when they die, and when they think about it, they know why.  If you don't have wealth, you have no proof that you've earned the right to matter.  There are billions of them and they know damn well that as far as the people who matter are concerned any one of them can replace any other.  As someone from a family that lived well below the poverty line the whole time I was growing up, I can report that that much gets drilled into you in a thousand ways as a child and understanding it and accepting it is a large part of what it means, among poor folk, to be an adult.

You thought there was no reason why lawyers learned Latin?  The line of precedent runs back across the 230-odd years of America, hits a speed-bump at the constitution, goes back to several centuries of British cases (French cases if you happen to live in Louisiana), hits another speed bump at the magna carta, and then cruises further back from there into Italian courts, from there into Roman courts, and even in a few cases goes back further than that to the old Greek courts.

You can open the border *IF* you don't blab about it so the public can cross, or you can announce it to the general public and watch a zillion lions converge to make sure it doesn't happen.  It looks to me like this is a straight-up publicity play; the guy has no intent to open the border (or at least knows he won't be allowed to), but wants the publicity that will be generated by a bunch of would-be border crossers running into a bunch of lions.
Besides, the US/Canadian border is pretty permeable anyway; it's very long, unguarded, and has a long history of being crossed by unarmed individuals who didn't bring any special tools...  such as the draft dodgers who (unlike Quayle) couldn't afford national guard posts.

I want a laptop where someone could take out the disk platters, scan them with a STM, do every "reconstruction" trick known to humankind, and still not be able to tell basic things like how much of the drive is in use or what operating system is installed.
To use it, you would have to enter the correct passphrase on bootup (256 characters would be about the shortest maximum passphrase length that would be worthwhile) for the BIOS to make into a key to encrypt the drive writes and decrypt the drive reads.  The drive encryption would have to be handled purely in hardware on the HD controller, specifically so that there is NO WAY for software running on the box to get around it. Every write and Every read.  And finally, it would have to have some kind of tamperproof keyboard -- noplace to install hardware key loggers.

Cryptographically interesting.  It looks like starting now, the highest-end threat facing a cryptosystem involves liters of fluid performing molecular computation. The kick is that these molecular computers aren't all that hard to design and they scale.  Which means someone can have a 1000-liter computer with somewhere near the same ease they can set up a milliliter computer. So we need to revise the recommended key lengths for security
purposes.  There are about 2^167 atoms in planet earth, about 2^30 nanoseconds per second, and 2^39 seconds till the next ice age.  So, if a tenth of that mass were made into ten-atom computing units that could complete a calculation every ten nanoseconds, I get about 2^226 operations before the next ice age.  Assuming each is a brute-force check, we should probably be looking at symmetric ciphers with keys a minimum of 225 bits long right about now. Round up to the nearest handy power of 2 and make it 256 bit keys. Fortunately, the AES, and several other recent symmetric ciphers, have a use for a 256 bit key. Unless they find some radical flaw in AES & Co, I don't see a real problem posed by molecular computing; we just need to start taking it into account when we decide what key length to use.

@_subject: Starting a Religion is not something to do lightly 
You can start a new religion which upholds anonymity as holy (like all those monastic brothers who gave up their worldly identities and names), but to pass it in reaction to this sort of thing would identify it, in most courts, as something that was done for temporal considerations rather than as a "sincere" religious movement.  The whole "temporal considerations" thing wears off after a while, but don't expect to get any respect in courts of law until you've been at it for at least a dozen years and have a solid and well-documented position in some kind of philosophy and, optionally, theology, which devotees of your new religion have written and published.  Performing works that benefit the public (such as operating charity kitchens, crisis lines, or shelters for the persecuted-
but-not-prosecuted masses) can add a bunch of credibility to a religious movement; That's the sort of thing that seems to have elevated the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence in San Francisco from being a joke to being taken seriously enough to be declared a "heretical sect" by the catholic pope.*1
In short, establishing a new religion - and doing it properly - would be hard work.  Possibly very fulfilling work, but hard.
I think to do it with integrity, you'd have to put serious effort into caring for the spiritual needs of the members.
And the masks would have to mean something, personally, that tied in with the philosophical/theological position you espoused.  I have from time to time wistfully considered the calling of a "Holy Man", but, well, Whatever my religion is I'm pretty sure I'm the only one and I don't really believe that missionary work is respectful.  Puts a damper on the whole "ministry" idea.  ;-)
*1:  For those who are *not* students of religious history, charges of "Heresy" are the Big Guns of the Catholic Church. It gets used about once or twice every three or four centuries, and in the past has only been leveled at groups which are a clear and present danger to the continued existence of the Catholic Church.  Whole countries used to go to war over such pronouncements, to protect the church from impending annihilation.  Groups that do not pose a clear and present danger to the continued existence of the Catholic church, in all  previous centuries, have been considered to be merely "in Error" rather than "Heretics".  Everybody's wondering if the pope knows something we don't about the fragile infrastructure of the Church and the nearness of its possible demise, or if he's just overreacting because the SOPI involves openly gay men dressing in vaguely catholic-looking nun's habits and performing good works.

Privacy can happen only among citizens who are

transactions for non-fraudulent purposes.
Privacy without DRM means being able to simply,
instantly, and arbitrarily change legal identities

the old.
Privacy without DRM means people being able to
create keys for cryptosystems and use them in

be a crime to withhold any stored keys when under a

there is probable cause to believe that you have
committed a crime or are withholding information
about one, and you should *ALWAYS* be notified of the
issue within 30 days.  It also means that keys which
are in your head rather than stored somewhere are
not subject to subpeona -- on fifth amendment grounds
(in the USA) if the record doesn't exist outside

Privacy without DRM means being able to keep and

I don't think that privacy (in the sense of having the right
to keep private details of your life from being linked for
use unauthorized by you) is ever going to happen if merchants
have the right to demand true identities.
As a merchant, you have the right to be paid and to be sure of
your payment.  I don't think you have the right to collect
data that you can correlate with every public and business
record in the universe and build a profile linked to my identity
that says what brand of breakfast cereal I eat, how much a month
I spend on sex toys, what kind of books I read, and whether I'm
in trouble in divorce court.
The problem is that there is no way to check what merchants
do with the data once they've got it; customers are prevented
from getting into the customer databases and finding out what
a merchant's got on them.  Merchants have no motive whatsoever
to police or restrain their actions in invasion of privacy, and
they have a financial motive to link data -  so there is no
reason to believe that DRM stuff on consumer machines is going
to apply to their data handling in the least.  I just don't see
any possible application of DRM that merchants would allow that
protects consumer privacy.
So yeah, I think that the right to privacy implies the right to
use a pseudonym.  For any non-fraudulent purpose, including
doing business with merchants who don't know it's a pseudonym.
And I think that's a constitutional right, whether the merchants
happen to like it or not, just like the right to eat in a
restaurant even if the manager don't like colored folks, or picket
outside a merchant's business on public property seeking redress
of grievances, or tell the truth about a merchant even if it's
not flattering to him, or otherwise exercising ordinary civil
rights the merchant might prefer you didn't.  You can't have
privacy without the option of pseudonymity, any more than you
can have bread without flour.
A few years ago merchants were equally adamant and believed
equally in the rightness of maintaining their "right" to not
do business with blacks, chicanos, irish, and women.  It'll
pass as people wake up and smell the coffee.  Unfortunately
that won't be until after at least a decade of really vicious
abuses of private data by merchants who believe in their
god-given right to snoop on their customers.
Understand that I don't really give a flying crap about the
DVD player; if I want a nice movie, I'll get together with
some buddies and make one.  And I'll let anybody who wants
to watch it download it.
What I want is the right to prevent my customer records at
the bookstore from being correlated with the customer records
at my doctor, my dentist, my insurance agent, my therapist,
my attorney, my grocery store, my pharmacist, the comics
shop, the sex-toy shop, the car dealership, the art gallery,
the stained-glass place, the computer store, the video-rental
place, my favorite restaurants, and my travel agent, and sold
as a nice totally invasive bundle back to the marketing databases
of all of the above.  This is not a question about "number of
bits".  I figure the database will have an efficient, no-nonsense
representation of all of these things, and a photo of the screen,
if it can be scanned back, is just as good as a binary copy.
I don't see any way that DRM addresses the privacy concern
of database linking.  Especially since I expect database
linking to be done using specialized software that doesn't
have to get inspected by anybody with a motive to prevent it,
on "professional" (Non-DRM) machines if necessary.

My problem is that if merchant's information is easily linkable,
or if several merchants have access to the same linkable field,
then privacy is out the window.  It's reasonable for a merchant
to know every deal I've ever done with him (pseudonymity).  It's
not reasonable for a merchant to know nothing at all about my
past dealings with anyone including himself (anonymity) nor for

They've been sold snake-oil claims of security so many times, and,
inevitably, seen those systems compromised, that even when responsible

regard it as just another claim of the same type that's been proven
false before.
So I can easily imagine them just not knowing whether the link was

The fact is that the NASA engineer has a huge advantage; s/he's not
working for a marketing department that will toss security for
convenience, s/he's not working on something whose code has to be
copied a million times and distributed to people with debuggers all
over the world, s/he's not trying to "hide" information from people on
their own computer systems, and s/he's not complying with deals made
with various people that require backdoors and "transparency to law
enforcement" in every box.
So the NASA engineer's actually got a chance of making something
secure, where the Microsoft engineer didn't.  Microsoft has to claim
their junk is secure, but in their case it's just marketing gas.  But
all this is below the notice of the decision makers; they *LIVE* in a
world where marketing gas is indistinguishable from reality, because
they don't have the engineer's knowledge of the issues.
So having the decision makers get real nervous was likely to happen,
whether the link is secure or not.  There's no information there
except that the decision makers have finally realized they don't
really *know* whether the link is secure.  That's progress, of a sort.
Battlefield systems have been that way forever.  Battlefield
information only has to remain secure for a few seconds to a few
hours, and they exploit that to the max in making the systems flexible
and fast enough for actual use.  You want appalling?  In the civil
war, they used monoalphabetic substitution as a "trench code" -- on
both sides.

I tend to agree...  I don't think "zero-configuration" networking has
a real possibility to create any safety zones beyond the immediate

it just works, you can plug it into an insecure or subverted network
and it'll just work.

However, that involves financial payments again, and nobody is willing
to do financial anything in a way that allows anonymous players.  So
if we care about the ability to have anonymous email, we can simply
eliminate from consideration anything that requires a paid email
license or financial payments to be made in exchange for the right to
send mail.
There is a better way, of course. But it may not be as profitable for
the people who want to sell certs, so nobody's pushing it right now.
Remember the "hashcash" proposal from a few years ago? It basically
involved the recipient setting some computational task that would take
a couple of CPU seconds to complete and demanding the results (from
the sending machine) before it would accept an email.  IIRC, it was
proposed with a probabilistic task, but there's no reason why it
couldn't be done with a more precisely controlled linear task such as
repeated squaring under a modulus.  Or maybe you could ask
distributed.net to find a way to use CPU cycles beneficially and
provably, and require some number of work-packets to be completed
before the mail is delivered.
The computational task can get arbitrarily larger, if the recipient
system doesn't like the look of the mail.  I can picture the MDA
going, "wow, I decrypted this one, but it scores 9.2 on my procmail
filter scale, so I better ask for and get fifteen MIPS-minutes of CPU
time before I actually deliver it."
Stuff like this can be done anonymously, can be done on the recipient
and sender machines, can depend on filters (the MDA sees it after it
arrives and gets decrypted) and limits the per-machine rate at which a
spammer can send spam.
It requires no central keying authority, no registrations or controls,
allows random email from people you don't know or haven't heard from
in a while to reach you, is a barrier that's fully customizable at the
recipient site, can be implemented purely in software (meaning nobody
has to get a licence or a subscription or vouched for by someone else
to send mail), and if someone really *does* care enough to dedicate
fifteen MIPS-minutes of CPU to getting an advertisement through to
you, it probably means he's got a specific reason to believe that it's
actually something you'll be interested in, rather than just being a

@_subject: thoughts on one time pads 
It's far easier and less error-prone to hand them a CD-ROM
full of symmetric keys indexed by date.
The problem is that most people will not take the care needed
to properly use a one-time pad.  For text communications like
this forum, they're great, and a (relatively) small amount of
keying material, as you suggest, will last for many years.
But modern applications are concerned with communicating *DATA*,
not original text; someone on the system is going to want to
send their buddy a 30-minute video of the professor explaining
a sticky point to the class, and where is your keying material
going then?  He wants to be ignorant of the details of the
cryptosystem; he just hits "secure send" and waits for magic
to happen.  Or if not a 30-minute video, then the last six
months of account records for the west coast division of the
company, or a nicely formatted document in a word processor
format that uses up a megabyte or two per page, or ...
whatever.  The OTP is nice for just plain text, but the more
bits a format consumes, the less useful it becomes.  And
fewer and fewer people even understand how much or how
little bandwidth something is; they think in terms of "human
bandwidth", the number of seconds or minutes of attention
required to read or listen to or watch something.
An OTP, as far as I'm concerned, makes a really good system,
but you have to respect its limits.  One of those limits is
a low-bandwidth medium like text-only messages, and in the
modern world that qualifies as "specialized."
Given a low-bandwidth medium, and indexing keying material
into daily chunks to prevent a system failure from resulting
in pad reuse, you get 600 MB on a CD-ROM.  Say you want a
century of secure communications, so you divide it into 8-
kilobyte chunks -- each day you can send 8 kilobytes and
he can send 8 kilobytes.  (Note that DVD-ROMs are better).
That gives you a little over 100 years (read, "all you're likely
to need, barring catastrophic medical advances,") of a very
secure low-bandwidth channel.
Of course, the obvious application for this OTP material,
other than text messaging itself, is to use it for key

@_subject: Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper 
Okay.... I'm going to summarize this protocol as I understand it. I'm filling in some operational details that aren't in the paper by supplementing what you wrote with what my own "design sense" tells me are critical missing bits or "obvious" methodologies for First, people spend computer power creating a pool of coins to use as money.  Each coin is a proof-of-work meeting whatever criteria were in effect for money at the time it was created.  The time of creation (and therefore the criteria) is checkable later because people can see the emergence of this particular coin in the transaction chain and track it through all its "consensus view" spends.  (more later on coin creation tied to adding a link). When a coin is spent, the buyer and seller digitally sign a (blinded) transaction record, and broadcast it to a bunch of nodes whose purpose is keeping track of consensus regarding coin ownership.  If someone double spends, then the transaction record can be unblinded revealing the identity of the cheater.  This is done via a fairly standard cut-
and-choose algorithm where the buyer responds to several challenges with secret shares, and the seller then asks him to "unblind" and checks all but one, verifying that they do contain secret shares any two of which are sufficient to identify the buyer.  In this case the seller accepts the unblinded spend record as "probably" containing a valid secret share. The nodes keeping track of consensus regarding coin ownership are in a loop where they are all trying to "add a link" to the longest chain they've so far recieved.  They have a pool of reported transactions which they've not yet seen in a "consensus" signed chain.  I'm going to call this pool "A".  They attempt to add a link to the chain by
moving everything from pool A into a pool "L" and using a CPU-
intensive digital signature algorithm to sign the chain including the new block L.  This results in a chain extended by a block containing all the transaction records they had in pool L, plus the node's digital signature.  While they do this, new transaction records continue to arrive and go into pool A again for the next cycle of work. They may also recieve chains as long as the one they're trying to extend while they work, in which the last few "links" are links that are *not* in common with the chain on which they're working.
These they ignore.  (?  Do they ignore them?  Under what circumstances would these become necessary to ever look at again, bearing in mind that any longer chain based on them will include them?) But if they recieve a _longer_ chain while working, they immediately check all the transactions in the new links to make sure it contains no double spends and that the "work factors" of all new links are appropriate.  If it contains a double spend, then they create a "transaction" which is a proof of double spending, add it to their pool A, broadcast it, and continue work.  If one of the "new" links has an inappropriate work factor (ie, someone didn't put enough CPU into it for it to be "licit" according to the rules) a new "transaction" which is a proof of the protocol violation by the link-creating node is created, broadcast, and added to pool A, and the chain is rejected.  In the case of no double spends and appropriate work factors for all links not yet seen, they accept the new chain as consensus. If the new chain is accepted, then they give up on adding their
current link, dump all the transactions from pool L back into pool A (along with transactions they've recieved or created since starting work), eliminate from pool A those transaction records which are already part of a link in the new chain, and start work again trying to extend the new chain. If they complete work on a chain extended with their new link, they broadcast it and immediately start work on another new link with all the transactions that have accumulated in pool A since they began work.  Do I understand it correctly?
Biggest Technical Problem: Is there a mechanism to make sure that the "chain" does not consist solely of links added by just the 3 or 4 fastest nodes?  'Cause a broadcast transaction record could easily miss those 3 or 4 nodes and if it does, and those nodes continue to dominate the chain, the transaction might never get added.  To remedy this, you need to either ensure provable propagation of
transactions, or vary the work factor for a node depending on how many links have been added since that node's most recent link.   Unfortunately, both measures can be defeated by sock puppets.  This is probably the worst problem with your protocol as it stands right now; you need some central point to control the identities (keys) of the nodes and prevent people from making new sock puppets. Provable propagation would mean that When Bob accepts a new chain from Alice, he needs to make sure that Alice has (or gets) all
transactions in his "A" and "L" pools.  He sends them, and Alice sends back a signed hash to prove she got them. Once Alice has recieved this block of transactions, if any subsequent chains including a link added by Alice do not include those transactions at or before that link, then Bob should be able to publish the block he sent Alice, along with her signature, in a
transaction as proof that Alice violated protocol.  Sock puppets defeat this because Alice just signs subsequent chains using a new key, pretending to be a different node. If we go with varying the work factor depending on how many new links there are,  then we're right back to domination by the 3 or 4 fastest nodes, except now they're joined by 600 or so sock puppets which they use to avoid the work factor penalty. If we solve the sock-puppet issue, or accept that there's a central point controlling the generation of new keys, then generation of coins should be tied to the act of successfully adding a block to the "consensus" chain.  This is simple to do; creation of a coin is a transaction, it gets added along with all the other transactions in the block.  But you can only create one coin per link, and of course if your version of the chain isn't the one that gets accepted,
then in the "accepted" view you don't have the coin and can't spend it.  This gives the people maintaining the consensus database a reason to spend CPU cycles, especially since the variance in work factor by number of links added since their own last link (outlined
above) guarantees that everyone, not just the 3 or 4 fastest nodes,
occasionally gets the opportunity to create a coin.
Also, the work requirement for adding a link to the chain should vary (again exponentially) with the number of links added to that chain in the previous week, causing the rate of coin generation (and therefore inflation) to be strictly controlled.  You need coin aggregation for this to scale.  There needs to be a "provable" transaction where someone retires ten single coins and creates a new coin with denomination ten, etc.  This is not too hard, using the same infrastructure you've already got; it simply becomes part of the chain, and when the chain is accepted
consensus, then everybody can see that it happened.

No.  This juvenile fantasy is complete and utter nonsense, and
I've heard people repeating it to each other far too often.  If
you repeat it to each other too often you run the risk of starting
to believe it, and it will only get you in trouble.  This is a
world that has not just cryptographic protocols but also laws
and rules and a society into which those protocols must fit.  That
stuff doesn't all go away just because some fantasy-world
conception of the future of commerce as unlinkable anonymous
transactions says it should.
In any transaction involving physical goods, the seller also wants
to know to whom to ship the product.  Since the laws in most nations
do not require the recipient of an erroneous shipment to return
the goods and *do* require the seller to give back the buyer's money
if the shipment doesn't go where the buyer wants it, sellers really
care that the correct recipient will receive the package and really
need some way to contact the buyer in case there's a mistake about
the recipient address or identity.  Otherwise you'd get people
playing silly buggers with the shipping address to get out of paying
for million-dollar equipment.
The law usually requires that the recipient of defective goods
or services has the ability to return those goods for a refund
or obtain a refund in the event of seller nonperformance of
services or nonshipment of goods.  Since such returns can be
used to launder money from illegal enterprises, laws usually
restrict anonymous returns. Therefore the seller needs the
buyer's (or client's) identity in order to comply with the law.
In information-based transactions involving IP that's subject
to copyright or trade secret protection (which is effectively
all of them since other IP can be had for free) the seller also
wants to know who is the licensee that's bound by the terms
of the license and who now poses a "risk" of copyright breakage.
In both cases this is a liability taken on by the buyer, and
not something that his "money being good" for just the
transaction price can ameliorate.
In financial transactions The seller also wants to know that s/he
can comply with, eg, "know your customer" laws and avoid liability
for gross negligence in, eg, money laundering cases.
In many transactions the seller wants the buyer's identity and a
liability waiver signed by the buyer so as to keep track of or
avoid liability for what the customer is going to do with his/her
Most sellers want the ability to offer the buyer credit terms,
especially when large sums are involved.  And even where money
is supposedly firm (like the money Bernie Madoff's clients had
in their accounts) it is subject to catastrophic vanishment in
extraordinary circumstances.  The seller needs to know whom to
sue or at least whose name to put on the forms for their insurance
claim if contrary to expectations the buyer's money turns out not
to be good.
If the cert authority does not provide the identity of the buyer
but asserts that the buyer's money is good, and this turns out not
to be true (as in the case of Madoff's clients), then in most
legal systems the cert authority is either liable, or can expect
to be sued in a very expensive empirical test of liability.  So
the cert authority doesn't want to be in the business of vouching
for the ability of anonymous people to pay.
The only way for the money to be truly firm for these purposes
is that the cert authority has it in escrow.  This makes the
cert authority a financial institution and therefore subject to
"know your customer" mandatory reporting, data retention laws,
subpeonas, and so on.  Also, it introduces a needless delay
and complication to the transaction that legitimate buyers and
sellers would mostly rather not have.
Also, in any large transaction the seller or cert authority or both
must retain buyer identity information in order to be able to
comply with subpeonas, inquests, or equivalent writs, for
periods ranging from zero in a few undeveloped african nations to
five years in much of the rest of the world.
In most of the nations on earth, there is such a thing as sales
tax or use tax on goods or services, and any transaction involving
more than a tiny sum must be reported (with the names of buyer and
seller) to relevant tax authorities.  Even tiny transactions must be
reported in aggregate, although these usually don't require the
buyers' names. Since the seller has the legal obligation to report,
s/he also has the legal obligation to collect identity information
from his/her clients.
Most nations are very sensitive about cross-border money flows,
have tax laws that apply specifically to international transactions,
and want to know such things as the buyer and seller identity.
In this case it is the legal obligation of both buyer and seller
in international transactions to collect whatever information
their particular nation requires them to have and report it
according to their particular nation's laws.
And so on.
Maybe in a cypherpunk world where there are no laws other than the
natural laws of mathematics, no physical world in which goods have
to be manufactured and delivered, no national borders or third
parties having a tax or legal interest in transactions, no information
other than valuable secrets subject to no post-sale copyrights or
licensing, no liability laws or customers-rights laws whatsoever, no
taxation, and a bunch of other bizarro-world conditions, the seller
would not need anything more than the knowledge that the buyer's
money was good.
But that's like proving that a pig can fly starting from an assumption
of an ideal, spherical pig of zero mass.  It is not the world in which
we live, unless we are black-marketeers in international waters, not
subject to the laws of any nation.
If you make it "optional" - where people can request a true name etc
when they need it to comply with law, but don't have to request it
otherwise - you will find that the number of sellers willing to do
business with anonymous buyers, and the number of transactions in
which they legally can do business with anonymous buyers, starts low
and then drops rapidly as legal troubles and scams of various kinds,
as well as new laws designed to prevent those troubles and scams,
catch up to the sellers.
Anyway, nothing's preventing you from building your "unlinkable" cert
system to compete with other forms of commerce.  But in the presence
of any other system whatsoever, I expect almost no one to use it and
predict that using it or running services that allow people to use
it will rapidly become illegal in all developed nations.
Perhaps there are other ways to achieve all of the requirements for a
system that people can use while complying with applicable laws.  I
cannot think of a simpler or more useful one.
Aside from being irrelevant because ebay does not function as a
buyer or seller, and only minimally as a cert authority in
their client's auctions (in particular they do NOT vouch for
anyone's ability to pay), this is blatantly false.  Ebay cares
about true names, and linkable information such as bank account
numbers.  Without them it won't let you use its payment system.
Also, try funding an ebay seller's account using just cash somehow
and tell me how it goes.  It used to be possible but it's been
several years since the law bounced on ebay for allowing that and
commanded them to collect true name information from all sellers.
Also remember ebay has to collect its fee from somebody and until
the auction's conclusion doesn't know how large that fee is going
to be.  They insist on knowing who that somebody is.

HTTP is not specified as a UDP protocol and extant browsers don't generally speak UDP.  Aside from that, most of the things transmitted by HTTP (coded webpages, client-side programs, and compressed graphics) are prone to catastrophic failure from small errors, and UDP is prone to small errors. UDP does not contain any provision for correction of transmission
errors.  When a packet is transmitted over the internet, there is a chance that it will be corrupted en route.  Electrical noise at a switch, a radio station too near a cable, cosmic rays, etc...  these are all things which can cause a bit or byte or word to be different at the recieving end than it was at the transmitting end. TCP/IP is an error-correcting protocol that uses incremental checksums to detect transmission errors, so that the recieving end can say, "wait a minute, could you resend packet number 12?"
or something when it realizes that it missed something or got a bad copy of something.  This is a good thing because it reduces or eliminates errors, but it introduces roundtrip delays as the sender and receiver negotiate to make sure all the checksums and so on are correct.
HTTP is a TCP/IP protocol that introduces several other mechanisms
to try to deal with its intensive usage of bandwidth, and one of these was (is) "slow-start."  "slow-start" says you don't transmit
more than 4 packets before the receiver notifies you about whether the first one was received intact.  After the receiver has acknolwedged the first 4 packets, you can assume that it's okay to have 5 packets "in flight" out there.  After the receiver has acknowledged the next 5 packets, you can assume that it's okay to have 6 packets "in flight" out there.  And so on.  This whole thing
was an effort not to overrun buffers along the way, not to transmit
faster than the receiver could buffer and process the data, and so on.
Slow-start was a good thing when it was developed, because at the time network latency was usually a small fraction of transmission
time.  Waiting for the acknowledgement to arrive usually didn't noticeably delay the transmission of additional packets.  But things have changed.  The bandwidth of our pipes, the size of our buffers, and the speed of our transmission has gone way up, switching speeds have gone up but have not kept pace, the number of hops on the trip from transmitter to receiver is now one or two jumps longer which eats the gains from faster switching times, and the speed of light has remained obnoxiously constant.  So at this point the servers are sending four packets, then twiddling their thumbs for a *LONG* time (relative to the time it takes to transmit them) before the acknowledgement packet gets back and they can send the next packets.  Google wants to change slow-start by increasing the initial number of packets to compensate for the increases in buffering capability
and pipe length relative to transmission speed.  I think this is probably a good idea.  p2p-hackers mailing list

a 19-year-old just got a 16-month jail sentence for his refusal to disclose the password that would have allowed investigators to see what was on his hard drive.  I suppose that, if the authorities could not read his stuff without the key, it may mean that the software he was using may have had no links weaker than the encryption itself -- and that is extraordinarily unusual - an encouraging sign of progress in the field, if of mixed value in the current case.
Really serious data recovery tools can get data that's been erased and overwritten several times (secure deletion being quite
unexpectedly difficult), so if it's ever been in your filesystem
unencrypted, it's usually available to well-funded investigators without recourse to the key.  I find it astonishing that they would actually need his key to get it. Rampant speculation: do you suppose he was using a solid-state drive instead of a magnetic-media hard disk?
