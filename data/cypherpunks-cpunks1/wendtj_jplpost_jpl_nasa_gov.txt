Does anyone know of companies that will sell Tempest
          shielding to a private citizen, and if so; what regulations
          and licensing are required to own this equipment.
          Thanks in advance,
          JPW

The new number for SS&S is (214) 907-9288
          Also, Lindgren RF Enclosures informed me that they
          now have exclusive license to market International Paper
          Company's SAF'N SHIELDED; and they give free samples ;-))

@_subject: SS&S response to TEMPEST inf0 request 
About 30 minutes after I got off the phone requesting
          product information and related materials, I recieved a
          voice mail message from Ray Helsop of SS&S.  When I
          returned his call, he informed me that the address that I
          gave looked like a residential address (Hmmm), and that they
          usually don't send information to private homes, apts,
          bird-baths, e.t.c.
          He then informed me that he had called my employer
          (the Junior Proletarian Laboratory), and varified my name in
          the directory, and the department that I worked in; and that
          since I work for a Federal Research Facility (DoD sinkhole)
          everything was `ok'.
          He then proceded to tell me about foreigners calling the
          company requesting TEMPEST information, and other "spooky"
          callers, and that it was now allright to send the
          product information to my home.
          After I told him my interests in the hardware, he ran down
          a list of avilable equipment, and asked about numbers,
          requirements, and said he'd send it right out to me.
          I hate to be presumptuous... but I think an "I'm trying to
          protect my personal computer from prying eyes" would fall on
          very deaf ears at SS&S, and I'll leave it at that. ;-)

Has anyone built there own TEMPEST reciever/antenna
          equipment?  I have seen articles that say that you can
          use old television sets, and that you can build more
          advanced TEMPEST unit for a hundred dollars.  This seems
          akin to the carburator that will give you 200 mpg, and
          plans for a particle beam cannon in the back of some zines.
          If this is so cheap and easy or cheaper-quicker-better
          (NASA-Goldin-TQM propoganda), then why haven't we seen an
          article/articles on the construction of a TEMPEST reciever
          and the associated tuning/specs on such an item.
          Is it possible, or nothing more than snake oil?

I have recieved information from Veratec re: the product
          Safe`n'Shield, and I have to say that for an inf0 packet,
          they have done a great job.
          The folder comes with 2 sample squares of the Safe`n'
          Shield material, and the specs for their product are as
          follows:

          In addition to some general notes and a customer list, they
          provide a 25 page booklet on construction techniques; both
          new and existing.  The material is very thin, about the same
          weight and feel as good bond paper.  The manufacturer states
          that this material meets the NSA 65-6 spec using this
          nonwoven material as the priamary shield.
          The material is applied just like wall paper, with comercial
          wallpaper glue, and from a construction point of view this
          stuff looks like you could do an 8x8x8 romm in a few hours.
          Alas, I did not recieve a price list on the material, but I
          am sure it will be a hell-of-a-lot cheaper that buying
          TEMPEST certified computers, and best of all...you don't
          have to register a damn thing ;-)).
