Gaining ISDN Privacy with data encryption
by Kevin Tanzillo
Making the public ISDN network private is possible though data encryption to maintain security, say a pair of ISDN researchers whose organization is soon to become  and ISDN user.
     Wunnava V. Subbarao, professor of electrical and computer engineering Florida International University (FIU), along with research associate Irma B. Fernandez, wrote a paper on testing and evaluating encryption based data security in the ISDN environment.
     Their interest goes beyond  academic.  The university, located in Miami, will become an ISDN user when classes resume this fall, linking remote campus in a distance learning application.  So far, though, the use of ISDN has been in the university+s research lab.
     Subbarao explains that BellSouth and Northern Telecom grants have enabled the university to bring in five basic rate ISDN lines and work with a range of equipment.
     Why we have gotten heavily involved in this is because ISDN is quickly emerging as a real, operational, reliable and cost-effective technology for end-to-end digital connectivity, says Subbarao.
     Here at FIU a large number of ISDN-based applications are being developed.  Some of these are point of sale, security monitoring, medical network and medical imaging.  In any of these high-speed data transfers, security is a pressing concern.
     We have investigated possible standards for ISDN security that allow data, including voice, transmitted over ISDN to have encrypted so that only intended receiver can decipher it.  This will make the public network behave like a private network and allow ISDN to be a solution in applications that require authentication, privacy and confidentiality without the expense of leased lines.
     In a software implementation developed a the FIU lab, the overhead incurred to add security to an ISDN communication is small enough that it will be transparent to the end user, says the paper.  We have successfully implemented the DES algorithm in software and the results obtained are      The hybrid cryptosystem developed at FIU uses RSA public key cryptogrophy for key pair generation and encrypts a random DES key, then uses DES for encryption of the contents.  They used an RSAREF cryptographic tool kit from RSA laboratories.
     On an average, it takes 68 seconds  to generate a pair of 508-bit keys running on a 486 PC base.  The RSAREF tool kit allows creation of a key pair of up to 1,024 bits, but the overhead incurred in the time to generate these keys is not warranted, given these keys will only be valid for one communication session.
    The time to seal, encrypt and decrypt an eight-character file was less than a second, and the time to verify the signature was around three seconds.  RSAREF allows for signature and encryption of message files of length up to 1,000 bytes, and timing studies for a file length of 700 bytes resulted in the same overhead as that of the length of eight bytes.
     We are currently updating our software to test signature and encryption of large binary files, such as image files.
     Taking more than a minute to create an encryption key may be acceptable in some applications, Subbarao observes, but he has his eye on transmission of medical data, when every second counts.  As a result, the FIU lab is working on a time-saving hardware implementation for creating keys.
     As the Subarao-Fernandez paper concludes, hardware implementation of DES and RSA scheme to privatize public ISDN are virtually transparent to the end users, and the time penalty incurred is insignificant.
     Regarding privacy of voice, the research paper observes:
     In the implementation of the ISDN prototype, the voice digitization will require encryption eight characters (64 bits) at a time.  Also, for voice applications, since the length and contents of the full voice message is not known beforehand, the message digest and signature for integrity is not applicable.  Data transfers over ISDN on the other hand, can take advantage of the message digest and signature for integrity.  The appropriate data files will be parsed into eight character (64 bit) blocks for encryption in DES CBC mode.
     As far as the particulars of the encryption research, the paper explains that the file transfer software was implemented in C programming language.  To transfer binary files, we wrote an interrupt-driven serial communications program based on the XModem-1K protocol, which extends the packet size from 128 to 1,024 bytes.
     File transfers were tested using the B channel in a BRI line.  future enhancements include implementation of the Zmodem protocol, which uses a 2K packet size, to take full advantage of the digital characteristics of the transfer medium.
     What the future holds for this security concept is terminal adapter security extension module that plugs into the PC bus and provides security to the ISDN user while protecting the investment in existing terminal adapters.  That module could support speeds to 4 Mb/s.

   Your point is an excellent example of what doing business in the US would be like... A pain in the ass!  If we had someone from the banking community that knew all of the ins and outs, we probably find that setting this up in the US breaks laws, would cost too much in all of the pay-offs to govt. officials, take too long,  etc.  I would suggest setting up in a off-shore e$ banking system to avoid all of this and get it off the ground quickly.
   Aren't the Swiss are known to have sufficient privacy?  They might be open to setting something up and an existing Swiss bank would have credibility.  Privacy issues, regarding transactions, could be kept private.  Why do you think crooks use them?  I have no direct experience with Swiss accounts  and have no idea what it would take to interest  the Swiss Banking community.  Anything that our government would come up with would be???
     a.   A clusterfuck.
     b.   Designed so that they could track the movement of money for
          IRS and of course, to fight crime..
     c.   Expensive because of all the regulations.
     d.   Have very little value add.
     e.  All of the above.
     f.   None of the above.
If you chose "E", you are correct. :)
   The ability to issue orders to a bank to move e$ from one account to another could be done quickly and securely in any bank.  If the destination is not at that bank, then the bank could create a check on your behalf  and reference your name, account or what ever you want ... if anything.  CheckFree in the US does this now but your name or the account your are paying on is on the check and I am sure our govt. has access to all the info in their database of transactions.  I could also send you a e-note that you could then send to the bank and quickly confirm that the transaction is covered. (This would be better than todays banking where a merchant can call a bank and ask them about my account but boost the amount of the transaction to find out if I'm ritch bastard or not.  With a crypto-sig on an e-note, I would be guaranteed that my bank would only answer questions about the amount on my e-note.
   I ask you to move $e}1000.00 to a reference number X20567 at my Swiss bank.  When I see the transaction deposited into my account I can send you my software.  This account could be a temporary holding account or my permanent account.  If you use the same Swiss bank or another Swiss bank that is part of the e$ community, it could take just a second and be easy for both of us.
   I guess it boils down to this, we have to have someone that we can trust.  The issue of currency conversion would also be a new one for me.  Would my money be Swiss?  If the transaction gos south, what do I do, I am no longer covered by US law and would have no proof that this transaction ever took place (remember, no one can ask the bank for records). Hmmmm
   Is there a way that we can make the answer  to my question above = "F"?

   Just an FYI, ViaCrypt makes a PGP agent for WinCIM (Windows e-mail for CI$) and are planning on others.  This is the key to making PGP the defacto standard.  When it gets as easy as pushing a button the use will increase in a non-linear fashion.

   If I my e-note instructed the bank to deposit some funds into a numbered account of my supplier, then I have no proof that that transaction was actually going to supplier X.  Remember, one of the requirements by cypherpunks is to mask (if desired) where money is going.  Even if I used the supplier's name on the e-note instructions, how could I prove that the name on the note and said supplier are the same?  The only thing I could have PROOF of is that I spent N ammount of money.

Can't be too UNIX centric.  With the advent of MS Mail and CC:Mail that have SMTP gateways, they automagically convert uuencoded files to attachments in the native format.  That is, when you send me a message with a uuencoded file at the end, my mail gateway uudecodes and puts the attachemnt in my mail messas as a clickable icon.  NOW,  all you got to do is convince me to doubble click on this (virus exe) and bingo!, I'm dead.
   Has anyone tried to infect or destroy an NT box with some known virus.  NT's security model could prevent this (I.E. trying to write to a restricted file or stay resident...).  But I'm not sure what is secured since almost all users use NT workstation as "Administrator".

@_subject: E-Lets 
The following article has some unique ties to digital cash and
what some people would like to see.
In summary it is a description of bartering being used in Europe
the removes money and replaces it with "Lets".
Money no good?  May I be the first to coin "E-Lets" :)
Title: "Money no good?  Try bartering"
... Additional reporting by Betrice Newbery.
The Single Market was launched with the Single European Act of
1987, and with it the vision of a single European currency.  But
while governments seek a future of trading in ecus, people
across the continent are looking to the past - to the days when
bartering was the way of the world.
   Local Exchange Trading Systems (lets) are a form of moneyless
trading, with more in common with 19th century anarchism than
late 20th-century capitalism.
   The inhabitants of Stroud, a village in the west of England,
can now pay for legal advice from a solicitor in "strouds" as
well as sterling.  In Madrid, masseurs and furniture removers
accept both valle kas and pesetas.  In Berlin, talents or
deutschmarks are used to pay for babysitting or carpentry.
   Lets are proving remarkably popular.  In Britain, there are
more than 200 systems involving as many as 20,000 people. In
Spain, the success of the Trueque Lets in Madrid has served as a
modle for similar systems to be created in Barcelona, Alicante
and the Canary Islands.  Switzerland has the Troc de Service in
Onex and Demark has a "Ring of Exchange".
   They could even spread to eastern Europe.  A pilot scheme was
started this summer in the city of Magdeburg in east Germany.
"Because of high unemployment and limited capital, Lets could
help people in the east to use their skills and talents," said
Hugo Godscalk of Paysys, a German constancy firm which
specializes in forms of payment.
   Although the organization of each Lets is discreetly
different they all share a basic tenet: that by tapping local
skills and spending power, it is possible to improve the
economic and psychological health of the community.  They work
by creating a local currency,  the "bobbin" in Manchester, for
example, and encouraging local people and business to accept
that currency in pay-ment, or part-payment, of goods and
   Joining a Lets is a quick and painless process.  On payment
of an initial, one-off registration fee (mainstream money), and
a negligible annual administration fee (local money), you are
issued with an account in the local currency,  a cheque book and
a local directory, which lists the goods an services available.
   You are then free, for example, to start paying for your
gardner or bying your groceries in local currency.  A small levy
is charged on each transaction to cover the administration costs
of the system and to pay the salary of the administrator.
However, there are no interest charges when you go into debt and
no restrictions on credit.
   While their simplicity makes them accessible, the growing
popularity of alternative currencies has less to do with
alternatives then the lack of them.  Recession, unemployment and
the high interest rates have left many people unable to earn,
borrow, or spend conventional money.
   The Trueque (meaning barter) in Madrid was founded in January
by Dan Wagman, an American who has been living in Spain for 16
years.  "The present system of conventional money is not
working too well," he says.  "in Spain, 20 per cent of people
are unemployed.  It is a terrible waste of talent and time.
Lets give the unemployed the chance to use their skills and the
impoverished immediate access to services that they couldn't
otherwise afford."
   Liz Shepard, who runs the national coordinating organization,
Lets Link, in Britain, agrees: "one in six United Kingdom
households were experiencing severe debt problems because of
high interest rates and recession.  An interest-free, non-
profit-making system appeals to them."
   Christine Schoeb and Carlo Jelmini were both students in
Geneva when they set up the Troc de Service in Onex as part of
their course work.  Another ten groups in Bern, Basel,
Winterthur and elsewhere operate their own scheme based on
   One of the founders, Simcha Piwnik, said:  "We get
professional workers advertising a whole range of services, from
electricians to furniture restorers to kitchen-fitters.  You can
buy furniture, bicycles, organic vegetables - anything.  It
almost makes traditional street markets redundant."
   Yet the proliferation of Lets has not been problem-free.
According to Michael Jacobs, an economist at Lancaster
University and author of "Green Economy", Lets must overcome
two main difficulties if they are to survive.  "the first is
common to all voluntary organisations: will enough people join
and remain involved to make them work?  The second is peculiar
to Lets: is there a tendency for people to leave the local
system once they secure employment within the mainstream
economy?  If so, they may well fail unless there is a continual
supply of new members."
   While survival can be difficult, growth can prove equally
problematic.  As they have become more wide-spread, Lets have
attracted the attention of national treasuries who are con
cerned that local currencies could be exploited as a way of
avoiding paying tax.  Moreover, growth has prompted fears among
Lets users that people could accumulate sizable debts and then
leave the community without repaying.
   In August, more than 60 people attended a conference near
Montpellier in southern France to discuss ways of introducing
Lets to that country.  In Dessau, in Germany, a recent
conference relulted in the setting up of six new systems.
   Henk van Arkel, from Utrecht, who runs a series of systems in
the Netherlands, was one of the participants, "We are planning
with the Irish, Flemish and German and probably the UK systems,
for international co-operation across Europe," he said.  "We
do need more exchange of ideas and improvements.  But we are not
going to link the currencies.  The most important part of the
idea is the local aspect."
   There are, however, sign that Lets are starting to encroach
on some of the traditional functions of  conventional money.
Trading between groups, for example, is just beginning in some
areas.  But it will be a long time before they rival the ecu.

OOPS... I found it.  They are adding a way to have PGP automatically add some cleartext on ciphered messages....
"...A version for MSMail..... We intend to have a windows toolkit
version available by September.  With this windows version, we
can then start work on integration into the various mail
programs.  MSMail is on the list.  Stay tuned... check back with

If you are really paranoid, keeping your private keys super secure is a good idea.  If a bad guy were come and steal them all she needs to do find out your passphrase (using all kinds of attacks.... camera over your desk....) and bingo, they can read all past and future message traffic to you...

FBI HUNT FOR HACKER
        Kevin Mitnick is wanted by the FBI for suspicion of software and
data theft from leading telecom manufacturers and service providers. Among
his victims have been MCI and Digital Equipment. An ex-convict, Mitnick was
described by one judge as having an "addiction problem" with computers,
similar to a drug or gambling addiction. During a six-month treatment
program he was prohibited from touching a computer or a modem, but the
treatment seems to have failed, and one detective says: "I've always
considered him dangerous. I had to go underground. If he targets you, he
can make your life miserable." (New York Times 7/4/94 A1)
   I also read an article in the Pheonix paper saying that he did a wire tap on the FBI guys that were trying to find him...  among other things.
   How do they know it was him?  I get tired of the News dudes printing stuff as if it were fact.

@_subject: Clipper Chip retreat 
Congratulations!  I consider the "Clipper Chip retreat" a victory for the Cypherpunks, EFF, and inhabitants of cyberspace.  We have succeeded in a tactic often used by three letter agencies... Stall!  The "stall" tactic lets you re-supply, regroup and plan the next attack .
   This event slows the government down and will provide the inhabitants of cyberspace more time to develop a defacto encryption system (PGP, RIPEM, PEM, etc) that will overshadow any scheme deployed by government.  It also gives us time to continue the fight against "Key-escrow" and government back This message may be a little premature but if true, we should be ready for the next offensive.  (yes offensive).  This bit of information also makes me wander what their next move might be.  It could be... "NEWS FLASH... Drug lord goes free because he is using non-key-escrow crypto..."

Think about it...  If you've had the ability to listen to any voice or e-mail traffic you felt like with a simple telco set or inexpensive computer any time, anywhere you felt like, wouldn't you put up a fight?
   It's like trying to take a gun from a NRA member.  Once you have a freedom to do something you aren't going to give up easy.  It's only going to be more difficult since NSA, and other three letter orgs are part of the    Our metro-police, FBI, CIA, XXX, have been able to tap phone and e-mail (illegally or with court permission, or in the name of "national security") as easy as plugging in a toaster.   Once citizens start using crypto systems, these three letter orgs are going to have to work for a living.  OK, so a crook is using crypto in his communications.  Most are so stupid, getting the keys won't be that hard and even better... the crook will still think his comm link is secure.  I'll stop here with my arguments for dropping the barriers to crypto.
   For NSA, finding the right string to pull is probably real easy.  The only thing we can do is continue to apply pressure at all fronts.  Educating the general public is on one front.  EFF has other fronts.

@_subject: PGP is Product of the Week 
PGP is Product of the Week in last weeks PCMag.
I will bang my drum one more time...
How to beat the three letter agencies:
1.   Power of the press is just one of the weapons at our disposal.  Public education and continued press on privacy alternatives is important.   One of the things that would help a concerted offensive against the three letter agencies that want to remove our privacy would be to send more articles to the industry rags.  Hopefully better than the one published in Byte.   The more exposure the better.  You there!  Start writing!
2.   Improve the ease-of-use factor for PGP... That is, write more front ends (windowing since most of the general public uses it).  Example: ViaCryptPGP for Compuserve's WINCIM and navigator.  I believe in the critical mass theory... "A product becomes a defacto standard not that it is always the best product but because of sheer number of users".  In this case I am pushing PGP but I think it would go for crypto products in general.
3.  Drive for an independent "renegade" standard like PGP.  The term renegade here meaning "having rejected tradition".  Flood the net with it and the genie is truly out of the bottle.   Now that PGP is "legal" in the US, and people outside the U.S. have the product spec no-one gets left out in the cold.
4.  Mentioned earlier... "Attack the NSA budget".  This can be a win and a loose since a smaller budget could lower our countries defenses.  It is possible that an attack on the budget would get them to lay off without any real action needing to be taken.

CPUNKS symposium this next Wed, November 30.
   Invitation to all Cypherpunks to join the San Diego crowd at Hops Brewery were I hope to discuss "What's your fingerprint?" and other related topics. Don't forget to bring your public key  fingerprint.  If you can figure out
how to get it on the back of a business card, that would be cool
(mailing labels work).
Place: Hops Brewery at the UTC Mall
Directions: University Town Center is at 805 and La Jolla Village Drive.
     From 805 head west until you get to Genesee and make a left.
     On Genesee make a left at the  first light and  turn into the mall.
     Hops will be directly in front of you.
Recon shows that there are lots of alternative locations with lots of
tables close by. Try to be there by 1830, as  we may decide to move
the meeting.
I will be standing wearing a  BRIGHT PURPLE BICYCLING JACKET.
See you there!

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

   I might be up for it but...  I would like to do the same in San Diego
and then have a representative of the LA group meet the San Diego group
representatives  to sign some keys.  It would be kind of nice to have a
group of trusted  cypherpunk members from each city to act as kind of
the "CA" allowing you to eventually have some trusted keys from MIT and
others that distribute software.  I guess it would be a semi formal way
to build a trusted  hierarchy across the country.
   Next step would to have cypherpunk-sponsord pub-key-servers to hold
these keys.  I don't want it to sound too "clubish".  I've just never
personally met any of the cypherpunks and therefore have very few
trusted keys since I can't trust any of the sigs..  Ya gotta start
   I would be interested in seeing one in San Diego to key sign and
discuss things like this, GAK, and others.  What do you think?
 - --------------
P.S.  Will be out on "special mission" from 1/16 until 10/10.  When I
return I would like to help make this happen.
   If you are interested and could attend in SD, send me e-mail and I
will start creating a list.  Make the SUBJECT= "SD CYPHERPUNKS".
