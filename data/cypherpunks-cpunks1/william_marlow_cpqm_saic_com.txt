To all,
I feel compelled to add some comments to this lively discussion:
The point was that we all need to be aware of the use of remailers as possible
parts of evil schemes.  The  recent revelations by some that cyberspace
reflects real life is the case here.  Remailers provide a means for the "dark
side" to communicate, but they also provide the means for "the good side" as
well.  Mr. Byfield's assertions are most likely correct that remailers are
used most of the time for "non-evil" purposes. Awareness of a problem is the first step in everyone addressing the best ways
that we as a society (both Cyber and otherwise) deal with it.
I have been targeted by those who wish to do harm using remailers.  It is not
a fun thing to deal with, but it is a fact of Cyberspace.
 I personally like remailers,  ones which have no governments, good guys, bad
guys or anyone else monitoring them, but we as a society must deal with all of
these elements.
