Yes, the scripts are freely available. The robomoderator has been
working for about three weeks and now I seem to have little problems
supporting it. Our human moderators spend relatively little time because
the majority of posts come from preapproved users, and approval and rejection commands are very easy to use.
The thing uses PGP extensively for authentification and secure exchange with human moderators. For signing approved articles it uses PMApp by Greg Rose.
There are still a couple of optional things to do (such as taking headers from PGP-signed parts of messages if they are there), but otherwise it is in working condition.
One really important thing to do before handing it out is adding more

Why people tolerate running "old" finger server on their machines?  Old
finger server giving anyone names of all users logged on, dynamic
information such as from where they are logging in, etc etc is just as
bad invasion of privacy as whowhere.com.
It does not take a genius to write a safer replacement for in.fingerd that
reports only what users wish to report about themselves. There are many
good replacements for finger daemon floating around, too.
I wrote one in perl, it is about 50 lines long and is free for asking.

Maybe it is only me, but I recommend "privacy-fascist" policy. This way

This is ultimately to the betterment of employees themselves if they
fall prey to complaints of the likes of January KOTM The Right Reverend
Colin James III (puke). For the information of those who do not know
CJ3 made it a hobby to complain to the employers of people whom he did
not like -- with not much success though.
The employees would easily be able to say that the employer has nothing
to do with the alleged matters of complaints.

A system analogous to anonymized voting may be useful in this case.
Simplified for a real-life office, it may be the following. Suppose we
have N workers. The secretary's program generates N random numbers and
publishes ONLY their SHA hash values. It also prints the numbers
themselves on separate pieces of paper. Secretary puts these pieces into
a hat so that the numbers are not visible.
Workers take one number each. Since they witness the procedure of taking
numbers they know that they have their anonymity.
Then they send the reviews of their peers to the management or publish
them in internal newsgroups, of course anonymously, attaching the numbers given to them for verification.
Since the list of checksums is (or may be) publicly known, there is
little way to cheat by double voting, and there is little way to find out
who wrote what.
Of course in their peer reviews workers should beware of using
cliches such as "Mr. X is a lying homosexual Sovok forger". :)

I do not know much about how SSL works, but SSH (Secure Shell) has
a nice safety built in. It creates  a database of known hosts and
for each connection it matches the current host certificate (public

It actually works. Maybe the same logic should be used in SSL?

@_subject: Code Review Guidelines (draft) 
Thanks for an interesting paper.
In part " V.Code (Security Issues)/3.Data Checking" you say the following:
`` Data coming in to Acme Widgets should be checked very carefully for
        appropriateness. This check should be to see if the data is what
        is expected (length, characters). Making a list of bad
        characters is not the way to go; the lists are rarely complete.
        A secure program should know what it expects, and reject other
        input. (For example, if you are looking for an email address,
        don't check to see if it contains a semi-colon or a newline,
        check to see if it contains anything other than a [A-Za-z0-9._]
        followed by an  followed by a hostname [A-Za-z0-9._].)''
END QUOTE
That is not entirely correct. An email address is much more than
that, it can contain "!", several " characters (not next to each other
though), "%", and so on. x400 mail addresses (?) can contain "/", "=",
and all emails can have "+" and "-" and "_" in them. Some of the valid email addresses are
user_name at company.com
alex+ at pitt.edu
mi%aldan.UUCP at algebra.com
user%host.domain at anon.penet.fi

The decision that have just made is not a technical decision, it is a business decision. You just decided that the needs of security outweight the need to be able to deal with 100% of potential customers.
For example, suppose that you wrote your report for Gizmo International, a company that sells a variety of widgets and gadgets to users in the
world. Their current setup is that the users can visit and ask the server to send them notifications about new products.
Based on your report's suggestions, Gizmo will have to cut off
all users with x.400 mail addresses, all UUCP users with bangs in their
addresses, all people with funky addresses provided by SPRINT, and so on. For example, my moderation bot received a message
from the following person:
From-Mail: /G=JAMBYL/S=KIWANIS/O=CUSTOMER/ADMD=KAZMAIL/C=KZ/
From-Name: my eyes just popped when I saw such address
There are a lot of international people using this sprint gateway.
This would potentially represent a loss of s significant number of customers who will be bitching about gizmo.com to all their friends.
This is a bad decision from the marketing standpoint.
I see this as a compelling reason to allow all possible email addresses
to be processed correctly, even if it means that there is more work
for code proofreading. At least the management responsible for
marketing must understand and approve your email handling guidelines. A
computer programmer cannot make such decisions himself.

Note that if B(JV) and C(JV) in a triplet (A(JV), B(JV), C(JV)) are not
mutually prime, they will generate very few numbers and not a whole set
0-16383. For example, if C(JV) is 20000, and B(JV) is 10000, and initial
A is (for example) 57, the only two numbers that this triplet will
generate will be 57 and 10057.

approaches even. Even if only ONE triplet is such as I described (and it
is VERY likely to happen statistically), the distribution will be

If only B is required to be a prime, that is incorrect. See below.
Thanks for your response, Don. I appreciate that we are able to talk about cryptography because it is interesting.
Re: triplets. It seems that even if only one number in each triplet (B
or C) must be prime, as you said, we are still not guaranteed that the
PRNG will be "good".  For example, suppose that B is a prime around,
say, 10000, and C is 2*B.  In this case, the problem would still be the
I agree that since lookup tables are used, the output for the XOR
engine would be more obscure than if the output of the PRNG was used
directly. This obscurity, however, does not imply that the resulting
XOR key data would be free of biases that I described.
There is a possibility that the biases could be exploited.
Take the extreme case: suppose that by an extreme stroke of bad luck
the output of your PRNG is only 11252 and 1. This may happen if B=11251
and C=11251*2 (I am too lazy to check if 11251 is a prime, but you get the idea) for all triplets, and all A=1. Would the three tables DIFF, etc.
be able to "randomise" the output? I doubt that, although can't say for
sure right now.
As for the code, I can sign the NDA *if* it is reasonable, but I can
only read your code if it is written and commented well. The problem is,
suppose I read your code and find a weakness. What do I do next since my
NDA forbids me from quotinbg relevant parts of the code?
Again, I am far from a professional cryptographer and would not be
able to do even a half-decent review. The comments that I make are
my attempt to find weaknesses in your algorithm.
I suggest that you hire a professional cryptographer with an academic
degree and ask him/her/it to produce an independent evaluation. It will
be worth more than my comments.

Please correct me, but your representation of what such people demand
is totally wrong.
No one demands that blacks should be given as much loans as whites.
The idea of equal opportunity is that people of equal standing (ie,
people with similar credit histories, incomes, levels of savings, and
so on) be given same consideration regardless of race.
Example: Suppose Mr. White makes $50,000 a year, has 3 credit cards and
has never defaulted on anything. Suppose Mr. Black makes $50,000 a year,
has 3 credit cards and has never defaulted on anything. The law, as I understand it, required that they both must be treated equally.
Understanding of that definition of discrimination by many laypeople is
simply distorted by the fact that blacks, on average, have lower incomes
due to many factors, of which many are often their own fault. Since
incidence of poor credit standing is higher among blacks, the average
amount of loans received by blacks is _not an evidence of discrimination_,
at least it should not be to reasonable people.
There are other issues when some demand that there should be programs
helping blacks (or any other category) achieve higher income. These
programs are separate issue from what we are discussing.
Also, some posters here mix totally different issues: 1) what is discrimination and 2) should the government do anything about it
or not.

It is the cross-section test that evidences discrimination: suppose
we have two large groups with the same credit-related parameters

A good question. It is based on the theory that every person has a
"utility" function in their mind. This function determines the "worth"
of money and worthiness of risk. If that function as a function of income is strictly concave

then the utility of your gamble would be
U(gamble) == 1/2 * U(0) + 1/2 * U(100).
By definition of concavity, it is less than utility of $50.
Whether it would be more or less than the utility of $49, depends
on a consumer, but it may well be that some people will not like
this gamble.
There is much evidence that indeed most (if not all) consumers have
concave utility function.
I know that I would refuse a gamble where I could win $20,000

for sure instead.

All this "environment" stuff is rather easy to test and control for: take
two groups of children -- one from one race, another from another race,
who live in essentially the same conditions. Then compare the average IQs and check statistical validity of your samples.
There was one study. They took a number of white adopted children and a number of black adopted children, and made sure that they controlled for

  "Toba," A Robust Java-to-C Translation System
  New Beta Release of Toba for Linux!
    "Toba" translates Java bytecodes to C.  After being compiled, the
  generated routines link with Toba's run-time system, which includes a
  complete garbage collector, threads interface (Solaris version only),
  and core Java API.
  Toba translates applications (e.g., javac), not applets.  Toba-translated
  applications typically run 3-5 times faster than those interpreted by Sun's
  JDK 1.0.2.  Toba's API does not currently include AWT or dynamic linking.
  The Solaris version of Toba has thread support; the Linux version does
  not.  (Thread support is not needed for many popular Java applications
  like javac.)
  Solaris, Linux
Our freely-available distribution includes source code for all of
Toba---we encourage outside porting efforts.  Toba (the translator) is
written in Java.  The run-time system is in C.  Toba uses the freely-
available Boehm-Weiser garbage collector.  The Solaris version uses the
native Solaris threads package.
(We have not used any of Sun's source code--in any way--to develop Toba.
Toba source code is free of all of Sun's licensing restrictions.)
While this is a beta distribution, Toba appears robust.  Because of their
significantly improved performance, we run Toba-compiled versions of javac
(and Toba itself) exclusively for development purposes and have done so
for the last four months.
For more information please visit our website,
        Or, simply fetch our distribution and enjoy running your java applications
many times faster:

Then I also suggest that you install a metal door and put metal cages on
your windows.  That will at least give you some time to wake up if
someone tries to break into your house. Also get a good dog.
Without that, having a gun will not do you much good. It will be more
trouble than itis worth because you cannot understand the situation
quickly enough after you wake up, so you may kill someone peaceful who
entered your home with good intentions, which will get you in jail.  If
you had a metal door, you would have enough time to wake up and assess
the situation.
One-sided approaches to security rarely are successful.

That was the essense of my letter. The problem of Tim's approach is that he has no time to react to a situation. The intruders will kill him faster than he will be able to shoot.
Also, do not forget that if you sleep at night, your eyes will not be
used to bright light. Thus, an intruder with a bright flashlight would
be able to make you almost blind (and yes, you can keep the flashlight
away from your body).
I of course have no idea about Tim's accommodations, but in my apartment
it takes about one second to break into my door if you have a heavy axe.
Then three seconds after you break into the door you are in my bedroom and
can shoot at me. Would a gun under my pillow help? I don't think so.
Now if I had a good door, I would have tim to wake up, cock the gun, maybe call for help, and so on. Quite a different situation.
Re: peaceful people in your house. Did you ever have bad dreams?  Did
you ever have guests in your house? Imagine that you have a guest who at
4am woke up and went to the bathroom. Then you see a bad dream how you
are being robbed, see the guy in the dark, forget that he is your guest,
and shoot him. Not very pretty, huh?
Again, if your house was well protected, you would not be so alert
and would allow yourself some time to wake up and think.
If you do not believe me, refer to the rec.guns FAQ. It has all
been discussed there.
And really, I do not get why anyone wants to argue over this point: if
you are concerned about ninjas, extraterrestials, robbers or whoever
breaking into your house, PROTECT YOUR F^&*($G HOUSE. Then you can get
a gun, blaster, grenade launcher or whatever, but none of the above will
save you if you have only 4 seconds warning.
I am not asking Tim to get rid of his gun -- I am merely suggesting
how to _improve_ security.

I promised that when I have children I will not have guns at home. I

them for any long period of time.
Lots of kids impulsively do things that they later regret. Like, once
one little boy hit me hard in the head with a heavy stick from behind
my back. I have never met him before, never even talked to him and never
angered him. He was 3-4 years younger than me so obviously he did not do
it because he was a bully. After he did it he was really sorry and no
one including his mom could explain why he did it. Thanks to his mom
who prevented me from beating the shit out of him.
Now, if he or myself had access to a firearm, the life now would not
be nearly as good as it is.
I've seen these sudden destructive impulses in kids many times.

As I said, the kid who hit me in the head with a stick was 3-4 years
younger than me. You skipped that part. Correspondently, I could beat
him easily (I did, but his mother soon interrupted me), which was
obvious to him. So he had plenty of information that would deter a
rational person. He had all the reasons to "to curb his impulse", as
you said, and he could have thought about his punishment.
Still, he hit me. He was NOT a rational person, therefore. Just as
simple as that, that particular kid who hit me should not be trusted
with a firearm at his age.
This is a simple logical conclusion.
Your arguments apply to people who do not do impulsive things. To adults
for example. Again, I expressed my opinion about raising my own kids. I do not
have an opinion on whether parents in general should be allowed to
give guns to their kids or not, but I would not keep a firearm  in my home when I have kids. I may teach them gun safety or shooting, but would never leave them at home with access to guns.

It depends on the quality of metal the pipe is made from. If it
has a lot of carbon the pipe indeed can split into small pieces. Also, as far as I remember, if you heat the pipe red and then throw it
into water and repeat this process several times, the metal may become very fragile.
Plz correct me if I am wrong.
Also, nothing prevents you from making grenade-like marks on
the pipes. It is very easy if you have the right instruments.
While in high school in Russia, I was taught how to work with
metal and indeed making these kind of marks is one of the most trivial exercises.
BTW, almost all male kids in russia experiment with bomb-making,
rocket-making, explosives and so on. Once I was going to school
 in a tram and a small bomb exploded right in my school bag.
It was made from Ammonium triiodide which is really unstable.
Everyone in the tram was really surprised and I was really pissed off.
In the hindsight it was fairly dangerous and some of my friends were
hurt by bombs. HOWEVER, I have a theory that males never really grow up and continue playing toys 'til they die. I think that guns are also
male toys, by the way. So the idea is, maybe if kids play enough with explosives WHILE THEY ARE
KIDS, they would get enough of it and would not continue playing with them
when they grow up (and become more dangerous). Like, I myself pretty much
lost interest in building explosive devices and rocketry after 18.
Since this country is too safe, kids do not get their share of danger
and try to recoup it in adulthood. Which results in stupid terrorism.

A nice, albeit quite expensive, way of pretection from traffic analysis
is to create a mailing list (or a newsgroup) and forward all messages to
all users of that mailing list or newsgroup. Of course, since messages
are encrypted, only the recipients will be able to decrypt them.
This way the list of suspects is all subscribers of that list or
newsgroup and there is no way to discriminate them.
Instead of having messages to be sent to all recipients all the time,
alpha.c2.org may be programmed so that it sends out every message not to
only one recipient X, but to X and 20 other randomly selected people.
It apparently makes traffic analysis much harder.
Then users of alpha.c2.org will have to install mail filters that

Hm, I wonder what would it take to incorporate encryption straight into sendmail (I am talking about actually encrypting not only message
bodies, but also MAIL FROM: and RCPT TO: data). The protocol extension
would for SMTP be something like this:
A server in the welcome message may say "PGP Enhanced". If the client sees this substring, client (after HELO) may send command
If the server answers "503 Command unrecognized", the exchange goes in the
normal way. If instead a text with 214 preceding each line gets sent followed by a final ".", this text is considered a PGP key for exchange.
Then usual MAIL FROM: and RCPT TO: follow, following by DATA command.
The data sent by client will be PGP encrypted. Moreover, the data may
have MAIL FROM: and RCPT TO: fields preceding any header information and message body. These RCPT TO: and MAIL FROM: override anything that
was supplied in clear text prior to the DATA command.
This change in protocol is relatively simple to implement and does not
require the actual sendmail to have any cryptographic subroutines.
Instead, sendmail simply calls public-key encryption programs with right
command line parameters when an encrypted message is received.
It is also possible to incorporate Latent-Time: into such messages.
What it gives to us is that a great number of systems can participate
in the more secure mail exchange. It gives clear advantages to each

Users of remailer network may use such PGP enhanced hosts to conceal
their usage of remailer network. It is rather obvious that when the number of PGP-enhanced mailers becomes large, it will be hard to tell
who is and who is not using the remailer network.

Indeed. If you indicate your interest, I can post here a more or less
full description of the robomoderator, how it implements secure
exchange between itself and human moderators, verifies submissions,
and signs approved articles for posting (it uses PMApp by Greg Rose).
Your criticisms will be most welcome.
We see no problem with user posting under pseudonyms, as long as they do
not try to pretend to be other real people and do not constantly mutate,
and submit their messages to the robomoderator for consideration.
Sorry if this question will provoke a mini flamewar, but what are
such reasons?

As far as I understand, the problem boils down to this:
   Nym users want to have an identity (belief of other users that
   a set of articles originating from many anonymous addresses were in
   fact written by one person). At the same time, we want to prevent
   users who do not have a permanent return address from using
   addresses of other persons.
One of the problems with allowing users to specify return addresses in
the letters is a possibility of forgery: what if
Mallory at evil-services.com posts a MAKE MONEY FAST message, and specifies
that her "From: " address should be Popugaev at get_high.edu? Such posting
could get Mr. Popugaev in trouble.
Maybe the following rewriting rule may be a good compromise between
functionality and security, for PGP signed messages:
1. Original "From: " address is rewritten as "X-Origin" or some such.
2. "From:" address is always set to the main user ID of the PGP key that
was in the signature.
3. For "Reply-To: " we use "Reply-To: ", if it is present, then we try
"From: ", and if "From: " is not present, "Reply-To: " is not set.
4. If "Subject: ", "Date: ", "Message-ID: ", or "Newsgroups: " is
present on the block of pseudo-headers starting with the first line of
the text, use them instead of trusting the headers of an email.
This way, we achieve the following results: 1. Positive and reliable identification of users is possible to every
reader of soc.culture.russian.moderated, not only to moderators;
2. Users gain additional protection from man-in-the-middle attacks by
using well protected pseudo-headers withing PGP signed blocks; they
cannot misuse this feature by lying about who they are;
3. Those who do not want to bother do not have to;
4. People with misconfigured email addresses may have at least
some address field ("From: ") set correctly.
5. Nyms can post freely through any anon remailers and always have their
identity show up in the "From: " field, even if remailers do not allow
users to specify their identity at all.
Note that I agree that we need to have a database of MD5 checksums of all
submissions and carefully process duplicates.
What do you think?

[this goes to cypherpunks at toad.com and freedom-knights at jetcafe.org. I am
not reading f-k, but I am interested in Dave Hayes's opinion.]
I am not normally considered an ally of Dimitri Vulis, so let this
be an attempt at being impartial.
Many members of cypherpunks list are right when they oppose the forced
unsubscription of Dimitri Vulis from this list. The sorry state of this
list is not the result of his flames alone, there is a large number of
people who discuss things of no cryptographic relevance.
We should remember that besides flames and scandals, Vulis has been
posting things that are most relevant to this list's topic.
We should also remember that individuals have the right and
responsibility to define what content they want to see and what content
they do not want to see. I am surprised at libertarians putting
forward propositions that are intended to promote welfare of "new
subscribers" and try to shield them from "lies".
Similarly, individuals are free to create voluntary moderated
associations as they see fit. As it was created, this mailing list was
not a moderated association.
At the same time, unfortunately, flames that Dimitri generated had
rendered previously 80% unusable list to be 99% unusable. These flames
had zero value for me personally. Since cypherpunks is a private list
(although it used to be unmoderated), I can understand the list owner
who wants to save his creature from total destruction.
I propose the following:
           into all Subject: header fields of their flame-related This solution will allow anyone with a clue to use appropriate filtering
and improve the signal-noise ratio, and at the same time will not in any
way limit anyone's freedom of speech.

If I am not mistaken, your objection has merit. My argument, however,
does not require one of the houses (Ladbroke's) accepts the reverse bets
(which pay me money of Clinton wins). My argument runs like this. There
are persons hanging around Landbroke who apparently think that if they
give Landbroke $1 in return for the promise to pay them $6 if Dole wins,
they get a good deal.
It is these people together with "William Hill" whom we exploit.
What I do is the following: I go to the Ladbroke's and offer to pay the
gamblers not $6, but $6.01 if Dole wins. Being somewhat rational, these
traders gamblers see a better deal than Ladbroke's offers, and
give me their $1 bills. This is very simple.
I take their $1 bills and run to "William Hill", where I take another
side of the bet. If Clinton wins, I get nothing and lose nothing. If Dole wins, I gain
$3.99 on every bet that these suckers agreed to make with me.
That was the essense of arbitrage that I propose.
Again, as I said, there is a way to make sure money on this situation, that is, to make money even if Klinton wins.
The arbitrage strategy is the following: as before, I go to the
Ladbroke's and offer to pay them not $6, but $6.01 if Dole wins.
I take their $1 bills and go to "William Hill". I buy, however, LESS
bets than dollar bills that I received. In particular, I buy $6.01 / $10.00 bets for each dollar that I receive.
The remaining money $1(1-6.01/10) I simply take to my bank. This money
is mine: if Clinton wins, nobody gets anything; if Dole wins, I get
exactly enough money from "William Hill" to pay off my debts to the
gamblers at Ladbroke's.

               Dornin                SAN FRANCISCO (CNN)
               -- Medical marijuana proponents celebrated their
               victory in Tuesday's elections with a ceremonial
               smoke.                "It's the will of the people," said Dennis Peron, an
               advocate for medical marijuana. "It is a mandate. It's
               about love and compassion about doing something
               that's concrete to help people who are sick and dying."
                                With the passage of the
                                proposition, people who are
                                sick and dying in California
                                and Arizona can smoke pot
                                legally if recommended by a
                                physician. While the two
                                states may say it's legal,
                                federal law still says 'no way'.                California's attorney general predicted the law change
               will lead to legal anarchy. "This thing is disastrous,"
               said Dan Lungren. "We're going to have an
               unprecedented mess."                Anyone suffering from AIDS and cancer to chronic
               pain and migraine headaches would be free to smoke
               pot under the new laws.                No written prescriptions are required. The passage of
               the proposition also means it's legal to grow pot for
               medicinal use.                That's exactly what worries
               Lungren. "We're going to have
               a hell of a time limiting
               marijuana use among young
               people in California at the very
               time that marijuana use is
               skyrocketing around the
               country," he said.                Medical pot proponents are setting their sights on the
               rest of the country, launching a national campaign,
               "Americans for medical rights," to focus on marijuana
               legislation in other states and on the federal level.                The news laws are expected to face court challenges in
               California. In any event, top nation drug enforcers said
               they will continue to enforce federal drug laws,
               including federal marijuana statutes.

engineer and have a middle class life. He wants to get married, have
children, drive a car, obtain insurance, work at some big company,
travel around the world, invest in mutual funds or buy stocks, and so
on. Reliance on government help is not important to him, so he would not
apply for an SSN solely to get Social Security, welfare and such.

against the tax gains of debt finance gives rise to an optimal capital
structure, just as the traditional view has always maintained, though
for somewhat different reasons. It is this new and currently fashionable version of the optimal

@_subject: Reputation based hiring (was REQUESTING INFORMATION) 
You do not want "visionaries" who will steal your files and ruin your
business. There are many persons who are very smart and creative, and
yet one can expect to have a net loss from hiring them. Intelligence and
any other factor cannot be the sole determinants of employments.
Reputations are very important economically: since everyone knows that
their reputations, and not only current contracts, are on the line, they
avoid incurring losses to their employers for a short-term illicit gain.
That prevents a lot of theft, for example, among other things.
Also, employers have their own gain by discriminating between employees
with an expected loss and employees with expected profit. Employees,
likewise, can gain by having good references from previous employers.
If you, in your "pro-freedom" rage, somehow manage to make employers to
ignore reputations when they make hiring decisions, you will immediately
create incentives for an economically damaging behavior. As a result, there would be a net loss in the economy. People will also trust others
less because cheating will not be punished as seriously as it is now.
Lack of trust would force them to waste more money on lawyers.
George, if you calmed down a little bit, you would have thought about
the following: just as people have the right to speak on, say,
cypherpunks mailing list, people have exactly the same right to speak on
"hiring-punks" discussion list. There is not a whole lot of difference.
Limitations to one right (like rules by list owners) are exactly
the same. It is illogical to defend one right and to deny another.
Another issue is, whom should we trust in their "DON'T HIRE ..." recommendations? You could insist, for example, that a certain list
made by a certain person should be ignored because that person was
not fit to make hiring recommendations. I do not view such activity
as economically damaging. If you, however, fought with the very notion of "unemployability
lists", you would in fact create an economic loss. Of course you are
still free to speak against these lists, but your position is not
Another issue: can employers base their decisions on the content of
applicant's USENET posts and other public messages? Why not?  Just as
"DON'T HIRE" lists, this is an issue of freedom: employers should be
free to seek whatever information they can find.
I may be completely mistaken, but I think that some of the
freedom-knights misunderstand what freedom of speech means. It is not a
positive right that someone (John Gilmore or Dave Hayes or the
government in form of free subsudized broadcast) should provide. There
is no "right to broadcast". Rather, this is something that the
government cannot regulate and take away. In the broadcast example,
no one should be forbidden by law to broadcast anything. That's it.
Of course, different people can disagree on whether kicking various
persons out of mailing lists and not allowing certain persons to
subscribe to certain mailing lists is a good idea, BUT this is not the
issue of freedom of speech as a constitutional right.

@_subject: kickouts done the Cypherpunks way... 
Suppose Mr. X, owner of foobarpunks mailing list, wants to kick out Mr. Y,
for his obnoxious letters to the mailing list.
Mr. X, however, is concerned that Mr. Y would subscribe through some
proxy address and would continue replying to messages to foobarpunks.
It is assumed that the only person out of the whole universe, Mr. Y, cannot be trusted. The problem is that X does not know which of the subscribers is Mr. Y.
The question is, is there a technical way to disable Mr. Y from
reading the list, or detect which subscription address is a proxy for Y?
If we assume that, at the moment when Y was kicked out, he was not
subscribed through any other addresses, the solution becomes simple:
for any new subscription request we require a letter of recommendation from some other subscriber. Since other subscribers are presumed to
be trustworthy, their recommendations would be sufficient. It is actually being done in some of the mailing lists.
The problem becomes more complex when Mr. Y is already presumed to have
infiltrated the mailing list, possibly through several proxy addresses.
Is there any way to detect/find which if the subscriber is Y? One of
the simple-minded solutions is to _mutate_ mailing list messages
so that all readers get slightly different copies of mailing list messages
for each recipient. (Such mutations may include common misspellings,
inserting spaces, etc)
If the mailing list bot keeps track of what changes were made in messages to which individual, and if we assume that Mr. Y has to quote significant parts of messages he replies to, finally the variations
in messages may be reconciled with variations in quoted parts.
Mr. Y is not stupid, and may go as far as comparing letters, received
through different proxy addresses, in order to detect "variations"
and avoid quoting them.
The question is, is there a strategy of making variations and detecting
them in quotes to finally catch Mr. Y?

Another nutty idea: to create a database of people who do NOT want to
receive unsolicited advertisements, and make it widely available.
The obvious problem is that some very uncsrupulous spammers would want
to grab this database and use it as a source of email addresses. This problem has a solution, however: instead of distributing people's
email addresses, distribute MD5 checksums of their addresses. For example, an entry for ichudov at algebra.com would be There is no way to guess the original text from an MD5 checksum.
Spammers should be advised to exclude all addresses with MD5 checksums from
that database from the recipient list, and include instructions on how
to get one added to the database into their spams.
Database maintainers could even provide a email filter-bot that would
accept recipient lists by email and send back the same lists, but
WITHOUT addresses that wish not to receive spam. This way stupid
low-tech spammers (who make up the majority) will be able to process
their email lists quickly and easily.
This database may be maintained centrally. Users may be able to sign up
for inclusion into that database by email or by filling out a Web-based form. Identity verifications may be done by using cookie protocol.

that spam-fighters can agree not to yank their accounts and not to

This arrangement basically makes everyone happy, for obvious reasons.

That's 50 CENTS per megabyte, but actually it is twice less than that.
My calculation (storage costs only, assume 10kb/sec/person):
6000KB * 0.25c/MB * 2.5E8 = 375 million.
Good money, but not even close to your number.
Also, storing data on optical disks is about $20/600MB, which is only
three cents per megabyte -- ten times less than above.
Even though this is storage media cost alone, 37.5 million surely sounds like a reasonable number -- it is 15 cents per person, or
90 cents per hour, or $22.6 per day per person. A little steep, but after
several years this cost may decline tenfold.
Of course my rough calculation missed a lot of important expenses.

@_subject: Ignoramus Chewed-Off on IPG algorithm 
I was sort of tired of endless talk that "IPG algorithm was not peer-reviewed, blah blah blah, so we won't even look at it, blah blah blah", and decided to look at what Don Wood writes and
try to see how his program actually works. Of course, I am not an expert in cryptography, and will appreciate all
corrections. The web page to look at is and it describes IPG algorithm in some detail.
First of all, the description of the algorithm is extremely unclear. I
understand that this may be Don Wood's writing style, but it is certainly not the most efficient style for precise communications. I suggest that
Don tries to rewrite his description to be more structured.
Second, I seriously suspect that his algorithm of "trimming" is NOT
going to work right. Just to remind everyone, he generates pseudo-random
A(JV), B(JV), C(JV) such that
and then goes on to "trimming" -- a process that obtains a new value
of A that is LESS than 16384 through this algorithm:        DO
         JV=JV+1
         IF JV=53 THEN JV=0
         A(JV)=(A(JV)+B(JV)) MOD C(JV)
       UNTIL A(JV)<16384
We shall first note that THERE ARE CASES WHEN THIS ALGORITHM WILL NEVER
STOP! For example, if all A values are _initially_ 16385 and all C
values are 16386 and all B's are 0, it is obvious that the pseudocode above will be stuck in endless loop.
No good for IPG algorithm.
in fact, if only some triplets of A, B, and C have B == 0 and 16384 < A < C,
these triplets will always be ignored (skipped) by his trimming process.
Second, IPG's claim that ``Of even greater importance is the second role
of producing a distribution of the numbers 0 to 16383, so that the
number of each of those numbers produce, asymptotically approach an
even distribution, in the same way that theoretically a true random
number generator produces a set of numbers whose frequency
asymptotically approach an even distribution'' is FALSE:
I do not see why the distribution of A's should necessarily contain all
numbers from 0 to 16383, less to "approach" an even distribution. For
example, if all initial A, B, and Cs are even numbers, we'll obviously
never get an odd number for A(JV), no matter how many iterations.
If, say, 40 out of 53 of triplets A, B, and C contain only even numbers
(not a statistical impossibility!), then about 75% of resulting values of
A(JV) will be even.
No good for the keystream. There are many more imperfections than just
related to all-even triplets.
- - - -
Let's go on, to the description of the "scrambling tables" and actual encryption.
He uses three tables, DIFF, DISP, DETR, each containing 4096 elements.
DISP is randomly generated (or so I understand his term "prescrambled"),
DIFF is a random transposition of DISP (same values as in DISP, but in
another order), and DETR, again, is filled with some random data.
It does not really matter to my analysis how DISP and DETR are generated.
Here's how he encrypts the data (in a loop for I from 0 to 4095):
                       D1=(D1+A(JV)) AND 4095
                       D2=DISP((D2+D1) AND 4095)
                       F=DETR(D2)<<8
                       D3=(D3+D2) AND 4095
                       BUF(DIFF(I))=BUF(DIFF(I)) XOR (F+(DETR(DISP(D3))))
I.e., D1, D2, and D3 are regenerated each pass of the loop and then are
used to encrypt item DIFF[I] (i.e., 2-byte word with index DIFF[i], NOT
I). That is very bad: what it means is that we are not guaranteed that all
BUF[i] will be scrambled! It is fairly clear that about 1/(e*e) (e is
the base of natural logs) will be left unscrambled!!!
This follows from the fact that even with perfectly random numbers used
as DIFF[i], the probability that a cell J will be scrambled is 2/4096
(it is 2 and not 1 since each hit covers two bytes and not one).
Therefore, the probability  that cell J will be left unscrambled is
                (1-2/4096) ** 4096
which is approximately equal exp(-2) == 1/(e*e).
It means that 1 out of seven characters will be left unencrypted at all.
No good for a stream cipher. I think that his cipher could have been
made stronger if he actually did not use DIFF[i] as an index and used
I instead.
Still, of course, his algorithm has nothing to do with one time pads.
Since this is clearly not a matter of high theories but a simple question of accepted definitions, there is little point to argue about it and I
preferred to address details of his algorithm instead.
There may be more problems with IPG algorithm that I simply missed.
I would appreciate your corrections and notes.
Thank you.

Note also that if B(K) == 1, his algorithm will need to make C passes
through the loop for JV == k, in order to generate a new value of A(JV).
This is very inefficient and results in a bias for triplets with high
Bs -- because they will generate good A(JV) more frequently.

Don, please look at my message that analyzes your algorithm in some

other things, your system would leave about 1 out of 7 characters
unencrypted, and also because your A(JV) are not as good as you claim them to be.

Don, can you give us this proof please? I mean really complete proof, not vague references to other people's theorems and metadiscussions. I do agree with you that your opponents freuquently attack you without

resorting to namecalling and character assassination.
I.e., your bashing of Paul Bradley, for example, may or may not
concvince me that Paul does not understand cryptography. It will NOT

Thanks for an interestnig approach to testing (see below).
A good point.
see below.
how about doing randomize()?
2809 is a too small limit. For example, if ALL B == 1, A == 16385, and C == 20361, the loop may need (20361-16385) passes to get to the < 16384
Again, if all A = 16385, all B = 0, all C = 16386, the loop will never end with a correct A (your code reflects that).
You are also bringing a good point that Chi-squared tests are not
sufficient to make any conclusions about usefulness of this particular
pseudo random number generator.

[This is an addition to my previous reply to Eric]
It bugs me that you are using rand() (a fairly lame pseudo-random
function that was never intended to be used in cryptographic
applications) to seed A, B, C and JV and then test the A(JV) for
randomness. Some may object to that. Just for fun, I am attaching a hex
dump of output from my /dev/random (Linux 2.0.24). You could simply take
these truly random values and put them in initial A, B, C and JV, just
to be sure.
I doubt though that your results (poor randomness of A(JV)) will be
any different.

I wrote a perl script for such encrypted list.
It works the following way: suppose the list address is
somelist at someplace.com. The list owner generates a pgp key
with user name equal to "somelist at someplace.com". The public key gets
sent to all list participants.
The members, in turn, submit their public keys to the maintainer.
He lists their email addresses in the "subscribers" file. The perl script gets invoked from procmail. It decodes the incoming
message.  If an incoming message is not encrypted or cannot be decrypted,
the list processor returns it to the sender (this quickly teaches people to do encrypt their messages).
The script then encodes the message for each participant and sends it to
the recipients. What you need to run it:           allow passphrases containing several words)

A couple of notes: 7500 messages/day is not the accurate measure of

If we suppose that each message creates 10KB of IP traffic, it gives us
75MB/day. 75mb/day is less than 1KB per second. It can be handled by a
simple 28.8KBPS PPP connection which will still half the capacity to grow
twice. A second dedicated phone line and a second modem can be added
later. I suspect that UUCP as opposed to IP connection will work better,
because UUCP gives us a unidirectional flow of data, which is much more
efficient than modems switching direction of the transport for almost
each IP packet.
I suggest the following configuration: a IBM 486 PC with 16MB of
RAM and 28.8 modem, running qmail instead of sendmail and Linux,
on a dedicated 28.8 PPP line. The cheapest used VGA display from the nearby waste dump will work just fine. Estimated cost: $700-1000 for the system, $50-100/month for the

Alternatively, let's think about this: premail always fingers
a certain user account at berkeley.edu to obtain remailer keys.
Suppose that Joe DrugUser uses remailers to talk to his
Columbian friends and the government wants to find out what he is doing.
They could just break into the computer at berkeley.edu and replace keys
with the government-provided keys. They could even modify the finger
server so that it would be lying only to Joe's computer and would
work just as before for all others (to prevent detection).
The government would then intercept Joe's communications and

The main mistake in the argument that you cited is the following:
it assumes that you know the cost of hacking and reading one's email
or files.
You do NOT know it. Moreover, while it is usually easy to find the upper
bound for that cost, the lower bound is not so obvious. Recall the latest attack on INN servers, when one trivial message (see below) could
be used to compromise thousands of internet sites, at the negligible
It is only safe to assume that the cost of breaking into a Unix system
(or any other server for that matter) is ZERO.
Unix security on multiuser machines is an oxymoron, it does not exist
and should never be assumed.
The problems with people actually securing their communications and
personal data are as follows:
1) It is costly to set up a more or less secure system (ie, a system
that is not a server and that is somewhat protected from various data
attacks) because of learning curve and other costs
2) Many if not most correspondents are so clueless they's never even understand what they need to do to secure their communications.
I had to drop several conversations with people because they were stupid/lazy enough not to set up PGP.

                         in on-site betting pools for football and

                         all employees that said the company wouldn't
                         condone the use of company e-mail for sports
                         pools, and reiterated many company policies,
                         including prohibition of employees from gambling
                         on company time.
                         "I trust a word to the wise is sufficient,"
                         Mr. Weinstein wrote.
                         Fidelity spokeswoman Anne Crowley said the
                         company took action three weeks ago, and the
                         employees who were either fired or disciplined
                         didn't include any mutual-fund managers. She
                         declined to identify the employee positions
                         or their business units, but said the affected
                         employees worked in more than one city.
                         She said that no customer accounts or funds
                         were involved. Fidelity has 24,300 employees.
                         Like many companies, Fidelity regularly
                         monitors employees' use of e-mail
                         and Internet and Intranet services, and
                         Fidelity notifies employees that they will be
                         monitored. Ms. Crowley declined to describe
                         how Fidelity learned about the sports betting
                         pools or to specify how much money was involved.
                         Employees also bet on baseball and golf games,
                         she said, and the betting pools occurred over
                         a number of months. "Small bets were typically
                         found," Ms.  Crowley said.
                         She also declined to comment on what nonwork
                         activities the employees were engaged in.
                         But several insiders said the infractions had
                         to have been very serious to merit dismissals
                         instead of warnings. Ms. Crowley said the 16
                         employees who were disciplined didn't have to
                         pay any fines, but said "corrective actions"
                         could involve verbal or written warnings,
                         suspensions or probations.

@_subject: Plot to Overthrow U.S.Government: three indicted 
Wow, this is a colorful story. As usual, I am not sure how
much of it is true. igor
          Three Indicted in Alleged Plot to Overthrow U.S.  Government
          AP 13-DEC-97
          LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) Three men charged with planning a revolt
          against the United States government wanted to create a new
          republic limited to whites while allowing polygamy to build
          its population, prosecutors say.
          Chevie Kehoe of Colville, Wash., and Daniel Lewis Lee of
          Oklahoma City were charged Friday with murder, racketeering
          and conspiracy in a seven-count federal indictment. Kehoe,
          24, directed the group, and Lee, 24, carried out the orders,
          the indictment said.
          Faron Lovelace, 40, of Sandpoint, Idaho, was charged with
          a single count of racketeering for allegedly being Kehoe's
          assistant.
          Prosecutors say Kehoe and the others wanted to create the
          Aryan Peoples Republic through a campaign of murder, robberies
          and kidnappings.
          Once the U.S. government was gone, their new country would grow
          quickly "by recruiting certain white people into the Republic
          and by engaging in polygamy so that the number of these white
          persons would greatly increase," the indictment said.
          The indictment did not detail threats or name targeted
          officials.
          Kehoe and Lee were previously charged in state court with
          the 1996 deaths of William Mueller, 52; his wife, Nancy, 28;
          and Mrs. Mueller's daughter, Sarah Elizabeth Powell, 8.
          Kehoe and Lee allegedly robbed Mueller, a gun dealer in Tilly,
          Ark., to support their cause, and the circumstances surrounding
          the deaths gave the Arkansas grand jury jurisdiction.
          Prosecutors said state murder charges would be dropped to
          allow the federal case to advance.
          Authorities say the Muellers and Kehoes knew each other and
          were associated through gun shows and militia group activities.
          Kehoe is accused of directing crimes that also include
          theft, interstate transportation of stolen property and money
          laundering. Part of Lee's job was to carry out four murders,
          and Lovelace's duties included one murder, according to the
          indictment.
          Kehoe and Lovelace are accused of transporting stolen goods
          from the white separatist community of Elohim City, Okla.,
          to Spokane, Wash., in March 1995 and again from Arkansas to
          Washington after the Muellers were killed.
          Lovelace was convicted this year of killing Jeremy Scott, 23, in
          1995 out of fear Scott was a government informant. Lovelace also
          has admitted kidnapping and robbing a Washington state couple
          in 1995. He held them captive for five hours after stealing
          their weapons and extorting several thousand dollars from them.
          Kehoe and his brother, Cheyne Kehoe, 21, made national headlines
          in February when they were allegedly involved in a shootout with
          Ohio police. It was caught on videotape by a camera mounted
          on a police car.  No officers were wounded but a passerby was
          injured by a bullet fragment.
          Kehoe and his brother were fugitives until June, when
          Cheyne surrendered and told authorities where to find his
          brother. Cheyne was not named in Friday's indictment.
          Kehoe was being held in Ohio awaiting charges stemming from
          the videotaped shootout. Lee was jailed in Arkansas on capital
          murder charges, and Lovelace was being held in Idaho.

Talk to Sanford Wallace, sales at cyberpromo.com. (or is that domain dead?)
The problem with hate speech is that there is a great number of people
who would individually attempt to shut down your pages. Even if your
ISP does not censor you, they will mailbomb, SYN bomb, ping flood, etc
your server, or even hack your provider.
It may be bad enough for your provider to get tired and kick you out.
A while ago I wrote a simple program that floods servers with TCP open
requests (see below). I have heard that some folks are now writing
improved versions of this program. It runs on linux and should run on
most unix boxes.
const char * Usage = "Error: %s\n"
"USAGE: %s (block|grind) hostname service# "This program opens  connections to the specified host.\n"
"It can be used to deny services, slow down and crash Internet servers.\n"
"If  is set to 0, it opens as many connections as it can\n"
"and continues trying to do so as long as it runs. Use Control-C to \n"
"interrupt it. NOTE that depending on your OS, it may hurt you too.\n"
"If  is not 0, this program only opens  of them.\n"
"After that, if the first argument is 'block', it simply sleeps. If the\n"
"first argument is 'grind', it starts opening and closing connections\n"
"in a round robin manner every second.\n"
"This program is for EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY. Please do not use it for\n"
"anything illegal. There is no warranty. Copyright(C) Ignoramus Chewed-Off.\n"
"USE EXAMPLE: \n"
"	%s grind victim.com 80 1000\n"
"-- opens 1000 HTTP connections to victim.com and waits\n"
"	%s block  80 0\n"

@_subject: Hate speech == HATED speech 
I would like to point out that much of the so called "hate" speech
should in fact be labeled "hated" speech. Let's take an example:
consider a history work thet denies holocaust of Jews in WWII.
Many of such manuscripts are rather dry and historical, and certainly
do not advocate killing anybody, and do not advocate any kind of "hate"
(although their authors probably do hate Jews on a personal level).
So why are they called "hate" speech? Because a lot of readers hate this kind of speech. Thus, it should
be renamed into "hated" speech.

Telephone switches generate (receive) a digit that is known as Call Type.
Simplistically, Call Types may be 1+ for regular calls, 800 for 800 calls,

One of the switch features may be some kind of call type blocking,

You can't lock and load an AK. I remember that very well even though it
has been a while. The bolt just would not go far enough back to pick up
the cartridge. The bolt carrier's charging handle would only go as far
as to allow for the weapon inspection.
You can only load and lock. And I think that it is the right design,
because a soldier cant accidentally get the weapon loaded.
I could field strip an AK (mind you, with all military gadgets) in 11
seconds and assemble it back in 21 seconds.
What crypto relevance does it have?

Well, the documents that the original poster requested -- survival, MOUT
(military ops on urbanized terrain), and much more -- are not restricted.
Some make great reading and are, to my big surprise, very well written.
The manual that I recommend to cypherpunks is FM 21-20, Physical
According to my spot check, most of the restricted manuals are not
actually of interest to most readers. They probably want to keep the
Russian spies out of knowing some gory technical details. The stuff
that is more exciting, like FM 5-250, Explosives and Demolitions, can
be found elsewhere.
They may be sold on CD-ROMs. Look at misc.survivalism for more details,
they sell them for $24 but I am not sure what's on them.

How about this scenario: I borrow 1 million dollars from, let's say,
Phill Hallam-Baker. Not wanting to pay it back, I pay to the
assassination bot and arrange him to be murdered.
Another story: suppose that I negligently caused fire that destroys
house of, say, Toto. Toto knows that if he sues me, I can arrange him
murdered for the amount less than the amount of damages. As a result,
he refrains from suing me, or (if he is a mean person) pays additional money to have me murdered. A suit would probably be a much better outcome.
Another story: suppose that OKSAS hired me to work for her, but then
our relationships go south and she fires me. Again, her fate is very
unclear, although I would probably spare her life if it were she. The bottom line is, it becomes very hard to do ANYTHING that disappoints at least somebody. That can lead to a lot of inefficiencies.

Phill, in this example, is not my friend, but a lender.
Mmm, likely the result will be that Toto will be impoverished (it is an
example, do not take it personally) and will not only not be able to
murder me, but also will be too afraid to sue me (because I would
rather pay for a cheaper assassination than to pay damages).
... But would happen more often if it was.
Why, I will have a lot of money.
This is a wrong Mafia rule, they do kill debtors who are in default.
When ten people make deals with each other, it becomes hard to
triangulate. And it is easy, if you know what deals are done, to change
the result of triangulation: suppose that I know that you borrowed 1
million from Toto, that my _and_ yours business partner had been
murdered (by me, but no one knows), and I am afraid that someone will
triangulate me and implicate me in that murder. I secretly order
the AP bot to kill Toto, and you get implicated.
Not good.

@_subject: Dissolving Choke Points (fwd) 
Here, I propose a new scheme for the Cypherpunks mailing list that would
1) Ensure that no one person is able to take over the control over the list
2) Ensure that there will be no single point of failure, i.e., shutdown
   of any single computer will not kill the list
3) Ensure that even people with relatively small Net resources can help
   keep the list afloat.
The idea is as follows: even though Cypherpunks is one group, the group
will be based on multiple mailing lists with identical content. These
lists may be named, for example, cypherpunks at algebra.com,
cypherpunks at toad.com, and cypherpunks at netcom.com (obviously, these names
are used as an example only).
Any user is free to subscribe to any of these lists. All of these lists
will interact with each other in the following way: 1) Each node would forward ALL incoming submissions to a) all other nodes
   and b) to all subscribers "attached" to the node
2) Each node will send information about all new subscriptions to    each other node.
The following procmail recipes for cypherpunks@ accounts may be used to ensure quick forwarding: # is it sent to cypherpunks (some spams will be trashed here)
# and is it not a mail loop?
* ^TOcypherpunks
* !^X-Loop:
  #
  # This recipe removes duplicates!
  #
  :0 Wh: msgid.lock
 formail -D 32768 msgid.cache
  # forward it to other cypherpunks lists
  :0 c
  !cypherpunks at netcom.com cypherpunks at toad.com
  # send it to all local subscribers
  :0 c
  !majordomo -some -arguments
  # store the checksum and message-id for honesty verification (see below)
  :0
# suSCRibe/unsuSCRibe recipes go here
This scheme ensures that the list is run in a cooperative fashion and
can be maintained by a number of individuals without any one of them
having an expensive internet connection or being "in charge". It also
ensures that even if one node fails, traffic can be re-routed to other
nodes. Just as well, it ensures that any attempts of cheating will be
noticed: it is easy to write a bot that would subscribe to all of these
lists and see if any messages get "lost".
Users can send their articles to only one node, or, if they feel
paranoid, to several nodes at once. All we need is to make sure that all Message-IDs of outgoing messages are unique at every node.
Honesty verification: I suppose that there may be some more elaborate, crypto-based schemes to control and monitor article distribution. For example, there can be
another list, cypherpunks-control, where each of the nodes posts a publicly available signed summary of checksums of articles that went
through, and individual users would be able (with the help of s simple
client program) to verify that
        1) They received these articles
        2) That summaries received from all nodes are identical
        3) That all articles were received by all nodes
They do not HAVE to do it, but they can if they want. If they do, there
will be no way for list maintainers to censor anything.
If a node goes down or if the users' verification scripts indicate a potential for cheating, they can resubscribe to some other node and
let everyone else know what's going on.
My proposal strikes me as fairly simple and potentially workable. Even
though 90% of the users will never get to usnig the verification
mechanism, it will ensure honesty.
Note also that this mechanism is a gross simplification of the way USENET works, so some may vouch for a usenet group instead. Your opinions will be appreciated.
        - Igor.

@_subject: Recommendation: Creation of "alt.cypherpunks" 
If the people decide for creation of a new USENET newsgroup,
we need to think very hard about actually moving it to a different
hierarchy from alt.*. I would propose comp.org.cypherpunks,
comp.cypherpunks, sci.crypt.cypherpunks or something like that.
A comp.* or sci.* newsgroup, if created, has the following advantages
over an alt.* newsgroup:
1) There is usually less spam in sci.* or comp.*
2) There are virtually no completely irrelevant flamewars
3) The propagation will be a lot better
4) More people will be able to read it because of the issue of providers
   not carrying alt.*.
I see nothing that would make a sci.* or comp.* newsgroup  worse than
alt.* newsgroup.

Listen to it, John is absolutely right. Running a big mailing list is
an incredible commitment and it is important to realize what you are getting into.
Another suggestion may be to set sendmail expire option to one day
instead of five so that messages that cannot be delivered would bounce
faster and not clog the queue.

it is not an alternative, it is a complement. i think that alt.cypherpunks will be a failure because all of
the troubles of alt.* hierarchy.
Add X-Loop: header and use procmail to protect against messages
FROM_DAEMON and FROM_MAILER.
yes, it is the other stuff that's the problem -- memory, connection
speed, etc.

@_subject: Recommendation: Creation of "alt.cypherpunks" 
If the people decide for creation of a new USENET newsgroup,
we need to think very hard about actually moving it to a different
hierarchy from alt.*. I would propose comp.org.cypherpunks,
comp.cypherpunks, sci.crypt.cypherpunks or something like that.
A comp.* or sci.* newsgroup, if created, has the following advantages
over an alt.* newsgroup:
1) There is usually less spam in sci.* or comp.*
2) There are virtually no completely irrelevant flamewars
3) The propagation will be a lot better
4) More people will be able to read it because of the issue of providers
   not carrying alt.*.
I see nothing that would make a sci.* or comp.* newsgroup  worse than
alt.* newsgroup.

Not only it takes a vote. What is more important is what a vote gives: a good discussion of the newsgroup and the formal RFD/RFD/CFV process
ensures that, on average, a good balance is found between various groups
of readers.
I am not concerned as to what the name of the group will be, it is
not important. What is important is that it should be in a more or
less flame-free zone.
It is too late to stop alt.cypherpunks, but if I had to make a
prediction again, I would predict that soon posters will BEG to help
them create comp.*.cypherpunks, because of spam and alt.flamage.
It is alt.* and soc.* that has most crap, sci and comp are way better.
It is a very good idea to let NoCeM issuers and filterers work independently from list nodes.

Here's how I do it (it is pretty close to your proposal): 1) I delete duplicate messages (by looking up the database of

2) I bounce all incoming messages to several other list servers
3) I pipe the article to majordomo for distribution.
Note that majordomo changes headers and I wuold like to feed
other servers with UNCHANGED articles.

Hi All,
I would like to set up my majordomo to request subscription
confirmations from users, by sending them a cookie. Looking at the
majordomo config files, I have not found such option.
Ideally I would like to have a system that a) requires the
new users confirm new subscriptions and b) once in a while
as users to confirm their existing subscriptions.
Is there any way to do it?
Thank you.

What you did may be the ideal way to go actually. It would be
great to have several NNTP servers with these (or similarly named)
groups open to the world. I believe that it is possible to set them up such that they feed each other.
say, the following groups may be good:
cypherpunks.pgp (sort of redundant with the pgp newsgroups)
cypherpunks.paranoia (or cypherpunks.tla)
(the following part is more questionable as some people would argue in
favor of nocems)
cypherpunks.moderated.... whoever else wants ...

@_subject: Excerpt on SPAM from Edupage, 11 February 1997 
I can suggest a scheme where a fee would be attached to the message,
and the recipient would be able to get the money only after having
read and understood the message.
For example, you might receive the following message (it could be encrypted
by your public key to preserve the cash from the MITM):
                     weuiyruiy3478ye874t23876459823y4897y5897y23849y589
                     39847578r3498yt893y75t9843y75t897y4385t9y74897gy77
X-Encryption-Key: in the message body
Dear Jim,
Here's one cyberdollar for you. It is "locked" by an encryption key. The
cybercoin is encrypted by an IDEA key and you can find out the key
by reading the message below:
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valentines' day presents at An ideal Valentine's day present for your significant other, at a reduced cost for you! You can buy your loved one a thousand used condoms (mint condition) at a reduced rate of ONLY $5.95!
Visit us at to get your postage!
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The encryption key is located at the URL above.
My opinion on this: I personally feel that this scheme is the way to go for spammers. Obviously, it is possible to build mail readers that would verify some kind of trusted signature on the attached postage, and
would highlight all such messages. The meaning of signature is "these
people are not crooks, there really is an encrypted dollar there".
Clearly, spammers who pay their readers to read their messages (and who
do get them to read) will have a very high response rate. That may justify adding postage to their letters.
The advantages are obvious. The disadvantage is a possibility of someone
stealing the money on the way, if the letters are not encrypted.

@_subject: Excerpt on SPAM from Edupage, 11 February 1997 
I can suggest a scheme where a fee would be attached to the message,
and the recipient would be able to get the money only after having
read and understood the message.
For example, you might receive the following message (it could be encrypted
by your public key to preserve the cash from the MITM):
                     weuiyruiy3478ye874t23876459823y4897y5897y23849y589
                     39847578r3498yt893y75t9843y75t897y4385t9y74897gy77
X-Encryption-Key: in the message body
Dear Jim,
Here's one cyberdollar for you. It is "locked" by an encryption key. The
cybercoin is encrypted by an IDEA key and you can find out the key
by reading the message below:
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valentines' day presents at An ideal Valentine's day present for your significant other, at a reduced cost for you! You can buy your loved one a thousand used condoms (mint condition) at a reduced rate of ONLY $5.95!
Visit us at to get your postage!
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The encryption key is located at the URL above.
My opinion on this: I personally feel that this scheme is the way to go for spammers. Obviously, it is possible to build mail readers that would verify some kind of trusted signature on the attached postage, and
would highlight all such messages. The meaning of signature is "these
people are not crooks, there really is an encrypted dollar there".
Clearly, spammers who pay their readers to read their messages (and who
do get them to read) will have a very high response rate. That may justify adding postage to their letters.
The advantages are obvious. The disadvantage is a possibility of someone
stealing the money on the way, if the letters are not encrypted.

We are going ot get full feel from Lance Cottrell and

We will filter messages by Message-ID to get rid of duplicates.
It means that there is no sense (unless you want to confirm my integrity
as the list host) to be subscribed to any of the other lists, as you will be getting multiple copies of messages.
If you are afraid of that and use Unix, the following procmail recipe gets rid of duplicates:

I am somwehat concerned by the behavior of my majordomo which is
very paranoid about incoming messages: it rejects all messages that

* * * LIST.
* * * * * * DO NOT JUST DELETE THIS MESSAGE.
I. Administrivia (please read, boring though it may be)
The cypherpunks list cypherpunks at algebra.com is one of the cypherpunks
mailing lists discussing cryptography, privacy, and social issues
relating to them.  These lists are connected to each other in such a way
that all messages appear on all of these lists.
All of these lists are high-volume mailing lists. There are several
reasons for existence of multiple mailing lists that are
inter-subscribed. The main reason is the large number of subscribers and
limited bandwidth of each of the participating list nodes -- each node
can take on only that many users.
Most people will not want to subscribe to more than one of these lists.
If you don't know how to do something, like unsubscribe, send mail to
and the software robot which answers that address will send you back
instructions on how to do what you want.  If you don't know the
majordomo syntax, an empty message to this address will get you a help
file, as will a command 'help' in the body.  Even with all this
automated help, you may still encounter problems.  If you get really
stuck, please feel free to contact me directly at the address I use
for mailing list management:
Please use this address for all mailing list management issues.  Hint:
if you try to unsubscribe yourself from a different account than you
signed up for, it likely won't work.  Log back into your old account
and try again.  If you no longer have access to that account, mail me
at the list management address above.  Also, please realize that there will be some cypherpunks messages "in transit" to you at the
time you unsubscribe.  If you get a response that says you are unsubscribed,
but the messages keep coming, wait a day and they should stop.
Do not mail to the whole list asking to be removed. It's rude ans stupid.
To post to the whole list, send mail to
If your mail bounces repeatedly, you will be removed from the list.
Nothing personal, but I have to look at all the bounce messages.
There is no digest version available.
There is a meta list which discusses the architecture and other issues of
the distributed cypherpunks lists. It is not intended to be used for
crypto discussions.
if you want to be added or removed to the metadiscussion list, send a message
"subscribe cypherpunks-hosts" to majordomo at algebra.com.
II. About cypherpunks
The cypherpunks list is not designed for beginners, although they are
welcome.  If you are totally new to crypto, please get and read the
crypto FAQ referenced below.  This document is a good introduction,
although not short.  Crypto is a subtle field and a good understanding
will not come without some study.  Please, as a courtesy to all, do
some reading to make sure that your question is not already frequently
There are other forums to use on the subject of cryptography.  The
Usenet group sci.crypt deals with technical cryptography; cypherpunks
deals with technical details but slants the discussion toward their
social implications.  The Usenet group talk.politics.crypto, as is
says, is for political theorizing, and cypherpunks gets its share of
that, but cypherpunks is all pro-crypto; the debates on this list are
about how to best get crypto out there.  The Usenet group
alt.security.pgp is a pgp-specific group, and questions about pgp as
such are likely better asked there than here.  Ditto for
alt.cypherpunks is indended as a mirror USENET forum for this mailing list.
III. Posting Policy.
Please note that some members of cypherpunks mailing list may surprise
you as very rude people. You may see views that sound very offensive to
you.  You will also see many articles that make no sense to you, are
very stupid, or appear to be commercial advertisements.
Consider such situation to be a price of YOUR freedom to post anything you
want. Remember that speech that pleases everyone needs no protection: it is
the offensive speech that is most often assaulted and thus needs to be protected. Also, speech that you find silly and distasteful may seem
to be of great use for others.
If you feel that some poster's articles are not useful and offensive to
you, you can set up your mail reading software to ignore all articles
coming from that person. Ignoring them silently has shown to be the best
way of dealing with them. It will save you a lot of your own time. Even
though you are free do write anything, please consider not following up
to their posts with suggestions to shut them up. It only decreases
usefulness of this mailing list.
Eudora for Windows is known for its mail filtering capability. Procmail
is a tool of choice for Unix users who want to filter their articles.
Please read the documentation for these programs to find out how to set
them to filter and delete unwanted messages.
None of the above precludes the administrator of this mailing list to
use tools protecting his hardware and bandwidth from denial of service
attacks. If someone maliciously mailbombs cypherpunks mailing list, the
mail bombs may be silently ignored and not passed on to the list.
IMPORTANT: the list owner does not monitor the content of the messages
appearing here. I disclaim any liability whatsoever for the content of
articles on cypherpunks at algebra.com. If you have a problem with any
materials posted here, please contact the poster to resolve them. Your
use of the resources of this list constitutes an agreement with these
terms. You have been warned.

A. The sci.crypt FAQ
anonymous ftp to rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet-by-group/sci.crypt
The cryptography FAQ is good online intro to crypto.  Very much worth
reading.  Last I looked, it was in ten parts.
B. cypherpunks ftp site
anonymous ftp to ftp.csua.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks
This site contains code, information, rants, and other miscellany.
There is a glossary there that all new members should download and
read.  Also recommended for all users are Hal Finney's instructions on
how to use the anonymous remailer system; the remailer sources are
there for the perl-literate.
C. Bruce Schneier's _Applied Cryptography_, published by Wiley
This is required reading for any serious technical cypherpunk (and there
are no non-technical cypherpunks).  An excellent overview of the field,
it describes many of the basic algorithms and protocols with their
mathematical descriptions.  Some of the stuff at the edges of the scope
of the book is a little incomplete, so short descriptions in here should
lead to library research for the latest papers, or to the list for the
current thinking.  All in all, a solid and valuable book.  It's even got
the cypherpunks-request address.

better off reading cypherpunks from cypherpunks at cyberpass.net. If you

I still think that it is a good idea to do nothing for several days and

Potential Killer or Just Disturbed? Psych Class Seeks
        Distinction
        By KAREN W. ARENSON
           NEW YORK -- The 20-year-old man with a Mohawk haircut,
           multicolored pigtails, tattooed arms and rings on every
           finger was an engineering student at a New York college when
        he sent e-mail to a public official threatening to torture him
        and rape his young daughter. The FBI arrested the student a few
        days later as he sat in his pajamas eating breakfast.
        Late last year, the case landed on the desk of Dr. Naftali
        Berrill, a forensic psychologist who had conducted court-ordered
        examinations of Joel Rifkin, the serial killer, and Colin
        Ferguson, the Long Island Rail Road killer.
        Now, Berrill is using the e-mail case in the class he teaches at
        John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. The class is
        part of the college's fastest-growing area of study: forensic
        psychology. Six years ago there were 96 students in the masters
        program; now there are 271.
        "There is a fascination with this stuff," said Berrill, who
        assigns movies like "Klute," "Silence of the Lambs" and "Psycho"
        as homework, along with articles in scientific journals.
        "Popular culture has gone nuts with the idea of taking someone
        who has committed a crime and profiling the person, thinking
        about why he did it, what is behind it."
        The goal on a recent day was to get his students to judge
        whether the tattooed man was fit to stand trial, whether he was
        legally responsible for his behavior, or whether he might be
        considered legally insane, and whether he is in need of
        treatment. Berrill had evaluated the man and knew the court's
        ruling, but he wasn't about to tell his students until the
        exercise was over.
        "How should the young man be handled?" he asked the students.
        "Is he really dangerous or is he only sick? Is prison
        appropriate or does he need medical treatment?"
        First, the students wanted more information. They did not have
        the young man to question, so they began firing questions at
        their professor.
        Did the young man have prior problems with the law?         Berrill shook his head no.         Any history of psychological problems?         Berrill reported that the young man had "apparently always been
        an odd duck, a person who felt separated from the group and who
        capitalized on his oddness." Since his arrest, he says he has
        had fleeting ideas of killing himself.
        How did he behave when arrested?         He spoke quietly and his speech was fluent, articulate and
        terse. His reaction was more surprise than remorse.
        Any other unusual behavior?         He used to have fantasies of protecting people beset by
        attackers. Sometimes he sensed the taste of chocolate, even when
        he had none in his mouth. Sometimes he walked around New York
        City with knives strapped to his chest and arms.
        For half an hour, the psychological sleuthing continued: What
        kind of family history did he have? He was the last of several
        children in an Irish-American working-class family, and he had
        brothers who had been arrested for drug use.
        Was he overprotected and coddled? The young man had said he was
        well cared for, but it was difficult to learn whether there was
        true affection.
        Finally, the students were ready to lay out their theories.         The young man showed signs of a narcissistic personality
        disorder or a histrionic personality disorder, some said. He
        might have sent the e-mail message just to get attention, adding
        the rape threat for shock value but not really as something he
        intended to carry out.
        One group thought the student himself had been abused. And some
        saw his threats as reflections of his own sexual inadequacy.
        Some students suggested blood tests and psychological tests to
        see if he was depressed.
        For many students, the analysis was better than an evening in
        front of the television set. "I love it," said Adrienne Higgins,
        a former florist who returned to college and hopes to go on for
        a Ph.D. in neuropsychology. Eva Norvind, who has a master's
        degree in health education and counsels sexual deviants, calls
        the class one of her most challenging.
        Some students go on to earn doctoral degrees in psychology and
        begin a practice. Others go to law school, and still others go
        into social service or police work. But Berrill estimates that
        about a third of the students take the class to indulge in their
        own fascination with crime.
        Berrill got to the heart of the question: "If you were in law
        enforcement, is he a dangerous person?"
        Most class members nodded yes. The most telling piece of
        evidence, said one student, was "the fact that he was walking
        around the city, like an armed bomb waiting to go off."
        And the dissenters?         "He needs help. I am very concerned about the homicidal and
        suicidal thoughts."
        Another commented, "In terms of being dangerous, he has no
        history. His use of e-mail shows a fear of social contact, and
        that doesn't fit the character type of a killer."
        Berrill was pleased. He had one more question: Does the young
        man have a shot at the insanity defense?
        No, most students said. "He was aware of everything he was
        doing," said one. "But he would be helpful to an attorney."
        Berrill beamed. In his view, the class had captured the
        important elements.
        "If I were asked by a judge," he told them, "I would say he is
        dangerous. Always err on the conservative side. He is in need of
        mental health services. But incarceration? No. He is not
        psychologically equipped to deal with real criminals or
        psychopaths."
        The court concurred. Earlier this year, a judge put the young
        man on probation and directed him to seek psychological
        counseling.

Alan, everything leads to elitism because it is a natural way of
existence of large masses of different people. The most anti-elitist
societies turned out to be most segmented in the end.
First of all, do you really want to see these posters?
Second, there are very simple filtering techniques such as
1) eliminating duplicates 2) eliminating any cypherpunks messages
not directly addressed to cypherpunks (prevents mailing list attacks)
and 3) deleting messages originating from certain persons. These methods,
I believe, do not require any kind of high intelligence.
Therefore, the people who leave are either very stupid people who
cannot cope with the higher traffic, or very smart people who do not
see enough of good thoughts.
The only two persons who do anything with this list are Gilmore and Vulis.

@_subject: Will off-topic libertarian bullshit be allowed on the moderated mailing list? 
For a long time, cypherpunks mailing list has been plagued by
two types of irrelevant traffic: Both types of messages were equally damaging to the content that I
consider worth reading: discussions about applications of cryptography,
protocols and crypto-related code. As a result, most of the people who
used to talk about cryptosystems do not do so anymore because they moved
to other, less noisy, forums.
It was very sad to see that nobody except Eric Murray wanted to
seriously try to discuss IPG algorithm, which was in my opinion an
excellent case study of a home-grown cryptosystem. Eric wrote lots of
excellent C code to check the "random" number generator, but no one else
was interested.
Cypherpunks's uniqueness and appeal is not in the breadth of issues
discussed: there are forums dedicated to libertarian issues, guns,
languages, terrorism, and so on. The mission of this forum, as I
understand it, was to provide amateurs with interest in applying
cryptography, and professional cryptographers alike, a good place to
discuss crypto-related issues productively.
It is understandable that many of those people who subscribe to
cypherpunks' credo of digital freedom happen to be devoted libertarians
and have strong views on other political subjects. It does not justify
bringing every important issue to this mailing list, however.
If restrictions on content are to be imposed, it is not only fair
but also rational to exclude off-topic political rants as well as flames. Both of these categories add zero value to accomplishing
Cypherpunks' mission.
Appendix: what we all received when we subscribed:
Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were more
of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy must
create it for themselves and not expect governments, corporations, or
other large, faceless organizations to grant them privacy out of
beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people have been creating their
own privacy for centuries with whispers, envelopes, closed doors, and
couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek to prevent other people from
speaking about their experiences or their opinions.
The most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption. To
encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.  But to encrypt with
weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for privacy.
Cypherpunks hope that all people desiring privacy will learn how best
to defend it.
Cypherpunks are therefore devoted to cryptography.  Cypherpunks wish
to learn about it, to teach it, to implement it, and to make more of
it.  Cypherpunks know that cryptographic protocols make social
structures.  Cypherpunks know how to attack a system and how to
defend it.  Cypherpunks know just how hard it is to make good
Cypherpunks love to practice.  They love to play with public key
cryptography.  They love to play with anonymous and pseudonymous mail
forwarding and delivery.  They love to play with DC-nets.  They love
to play with secure communications of all kinds.
Cypherpunks write code.  They know that someone has to write code to
defend privacy, and since it's their privacy, they're going to write
it.  Cypherpunks publish their code so that their fellow cypherpunks
may practice and play with it.  Cypherpunks realize that security is
not built in a day and are patient with incremental progress.
Cypherpunks don't care if you don't like the software they write. Cypherpunks know that software can't be destroyed.  Cypherpunks know
that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down.
Cypherpunks will make the networks safe for privacy.

@_subject: Will off-topic libertarian bullshit be allowed on the moderated mailing list? 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Thanks for your comments. I apologize for not being clear. I do call for
a total restriction on political discussions not related to privacy and
cryptography. It so happens that the vast majority of off-topic
political ranters on this list are of libertarian persuasion, that's why
I used word "libertarian" to identify what I was talking about. Of
course, I consider any discussion of politics not related to the
cypherpunks charter to be inappropriate for the list.
For example, if in the future a socialist joins this list and starts
advocating gun control, he should be censored just as well.
I do not advocate censoring any particular political view more
than any other.
Another question is, how do we tell an on-topic political discussion
from an off-topic discussion? My suggestion for such litmus test would be to ask: do different political alternatives being discussed
have immediate ramifications for digital privacy and use of encryption?
For instance, discussion of ITAR regulations obviously passes the litmus
test.  Discussion of machine gun laws, to the contrary, has nothing to
do directly with any encryption issues or privacy issues, and should
therefore be banned.
Some may argue that they can build a logic chain that would imply
that more machine guns means more encryption or something like that,
and use this as an argument in favor of allowing machine gun discussions. This is not a correct approach because the logical chain
would not be "direct" in the sense above.
This is absolutely correct. I do not believe that this problem has
a universal and perfect solution. One of the possible remedies would be
to write a charter that restricts moderators' ability to censor messages,
and have a diverse moderator board.
We may be in very deep water already. Lately we had a discussion
about a token-based protocol for identifying posters. Someone raised
an issue of preserving anonymity of remailer users, and brought up
a point that in certain cases the list maintainer should be "trusted".
Vulis followed up with a message insulting Gilmore, and said that Gilmore should not be trusted in that cryptographic protocol.
Is that about cryptography? And if we answer no, why is our answer
different from the answer for a discussion about machine guns? If we
answer yes, we'd have no way to legitimately prevent other annoying
Again, some aspects of finance -- for example, ensuring integrity and
secrecy of electronic transactions -- are. Some, like whether blacks
should pay higher rates in consumer loans, or why investment bankers
make more than computer programmers -- are not. The litmus test should
be the same.
This is an excellent argument. I am not sure if my answer to it is any good, but do we want to make this a general education forum that is
meant to be a free replacement for college and books? Probably not.
"Political savviness for cypherpunks" probably does not mean that
cypherpunks should learn here how to run campaigns. Financial savviness
probably does not imply that cypherpunks should expect to learn here the
methods of derivatives pricing, negotiating M&A deals, and security analysis. There are better places to do that.
You are mentioning learning the "context of crypto applications", and that
is very close to the answer that I had in mind. Discussions of all disciplines -- law, finance, politics -- are very important and relevant here as long as they are giving us the "context of crypto applications",
and irrelevant beyond that.
Having all these interesting people here does not contradict my
proposals in any way.

A good note.
Checking PGP signatures for all messages from preapproved posters is one
of the possible modes of running STUMP (you have to define
WHITELIST_MUST_SIGN=YES). This may be appropriate on cypherpunks, but
for regular newsgroups it is rarely practical, because the users are dumb
and clueless. On Cypherpunks that may work well and even add some cool
flavor to the whole process, as well as help popularize PGP.
Another advantage of robo-verification of signatures is that people
reading cpunks will know that PGP signed messages really are signed,
without the need to keep PGP keys of everyone. That is, of course, if
you trust the robomoderator.
This is all described at STUMP page. STUMP means Secure Team-based
USENET Moderation Program, by the way.

Thanks, Rich, for a thoughtful post.
I hope that lawyers here could comment on this, and I hope that it
is relevant to the cupherpunks issues at hand.
You gave us another example of why charters that restrict moderators'
ability to reject posts are good. In soc.culture.russian.moderated
we had a similar problem (now resolved completely), when certain anonymous
posters posted articles that looked like articles from newspapers.
After long thinking, moderator board has come with the following solution: There is also a related issue of moderators' responsibility for libel.
Our position was the following: libel involves some lies that damages
people's reputations. We cannot verify truthfulness of articles,
therefore we cannot tell libel from non-libel.
A classical example was the following: we have an Orthodox Jewish
poster. Suppose someone else posts an article where he describes that
poster as eating pork regularly. Such an article can, in theory, be
rather damaging for that person, and would be libelous if untrue.
We are not necessarily aware that Jewish customs involve prohibition
on eating swines, and so we cannot know that the post could be
damaging. Nor do we have any practical way of checking what that person We are required to reject flames if we consider them harassing, but we
do not accept responsibility for telling libel from non-libel.
We also add the following header fields to each article:
X-SCRM-Policy: X-SCRM-Info-1: Send submissions to             scrm at algebra.com
X-SCRM-Info-2: Send technical complaints to    scrm-admin at algebra.com
X-SCRM-Info-3: Send complaints about policy to scrm-board at algebra.com

That is incorrect on several counts. First of all, our charter does not
prohibit flames. It prohibits harassment and spells out what should
be considered harassment:

Charter> Second, nobody on scrm called Alex Iatskovski, whom you mentioned above
as SCR FAQ maintainer, "cocksucker", "motherfucker", or "child
molester". In fact, Dejanews search and my private archive indicate that
words cocksucker, motherfucker, molester were not used at all in our
Note that I do not suggest that s.c.r.m. moderators are always fair
or always right or that we always interpret our charter correctly or
that our charter is perfect. The proposal and practice of moderation
is controversial. As you and I know, there are cases when we think that
moderation is justified, and there are cases when we think that it is
not justified.
This is, again, incorrect. Neither Alex Iatskovski nor any other person
associated with you has ever been on the black list. The purpose of the
black list is not to ignore people whom we do not like, but to prevent mailbombing of moderators.

Pierre -- Thanks for inventing an interesting encryption method. There is a
mailing list for people interested in encryption, cypherpunks at toad.com,
and they may be interested in trying to "break" your program. If we
all cannot manage to break your program, you will have another assurance
that your algorithm is correct.
Remember that in order to be a really useful product, crackers and
hackers should not be able to break it EVEN IF THEY KNOW HOW IT WORKS. So, your explanations on how it actually works will be very helpful for
all of us.

I also did a frequency analysis on letters of the ciphertext. Here's the
output of my frequency program: a:71 b:72 c:66 d:55 e:48 f:57 g:68 h:49 i:72 j:52 k:59 l:48 m:77 n:80
o:41 p:70 q:59 r:63 s:62 t:63 u:53 v:55 w:62 x:60 y:45 z:66
Min = 41, Max = 80, mean = 60.500000, std = 10.044899
16 letters' frequencies are within 50--70, 10 are out, which suggests that the distribution may not be "normal". For a normal the
proportion should be something like 84:16.
I also tried xoring the plaintext line with the ciphertext line, w/o
much enlightenment.
I also likes "follows": "vkbcjtp" note how ll gets translated to "bc".
That suggest that after some encryption of each letter from the plaintext
there is a consecutively increasing number added.

I think that Bill proposes a very interesting idea. His suggestion would

at a "whim" of moderators.
My only concern is that there will be more work for moderators, because
in his scheme each "bad" message has to be reviewed by N people instead
of 1.
It is a tradeoff between a more liberal policy and efficient use of

Greg brings up a number of very good points.
A small correction: robomod does not necessarily require authentication
of posters from the preapproved list. It is merely an option that can be turned on and off.
We should all understand that forgeries in the names of preapproved
people are only a SYMPTOM of a problem, not a problem in and of itself.
The true problem in such case would be that the forgers feel that they
are treated unfairly by moderators. Such people may think that the
purpose of moderation is to get rid of their persons altogether.
Therefore, if moderators face a problem of forgeries and perceive a need to turn this authentication option on, they should step back and this what THEY did wrong. Did they give the forgers an impression that moderators want to silence them? Do they treat everyone, including the
former "problem" people, fairly and equally?
I have a suggestion, actually. I can rewrite STUMP in such a way that
when moderators receive messages for moderation, they would not see any
header information indicating who wrote the message (this information would be in the packet that arrives to them, but it would be encrypted
with Internal Traffic Key). This way, a moderator would not know if the
message is, say, from Tim May or from Dr. Vulis, and would make their
decisions (including decisions to preapprove) based solely on the
message contents. That may give some way towards fairness.
Greg mentions several important and real dissadvantages of preapproved
lists, but the huge advantage that they give is a reduction in costs of
human moderation. Namely, human moderators do not have to work as hard,
and the latency (thanks, Rich!) of most posts is dramatically reduced.
DISADVANTAGES (Greg):
1) creates two "classes" of posters
2) somewhat arbitrary
3) possible forgeries require authentication and that's a pain
ADVANTAGES: 1) reduces moderators' effort
2) reduces latency
3) depends on how you look at it -- required authentication may be "good".
4) for people like Eric Murray, who post on-topic articles, the list
   becomes essentially unmoderated, as it used to be.
Note that another important feature of STUMP that we seem to overlook was
designed specifically to address the problems of preapproved lists. This
feature is the presence of "bad words list". This is a set of regular
expressions, stored in a file, such that if incoming messages match
these expressions, they would be considered "suspicious" even if they
purport to be "From: " preapproved persons. That goes a long way towards
security and fairness because now nobody (including, say, Paul Bradley
along with Dr. Vulis or myself) would be able to call someone else
"cocksucker" without review by human moderators.
*If* moderators are fair, that would ensure that people are treated
equally even if some of them are preapproved and some are not.

I think that 95% figure is a bit high. I hope I did not claim it:), at
least STUMP home page gives a more conservative number of 80%. For scrm,
the number may be higher than that, but I would not guarantee 95% for
every other newsgroup or mailing list. The variable that this number
depends on is the preapproval policy.
For example, in the windows 95 newsgroup where STUMP is used, their
criteria for preapproval is very strict -- they require 5 successive
approved posts to get a poster preapproved. That will inevitably result
in more work for moderators, but heck, that's what they want.
I would normally expect this number to settle around 85-90% eventually,
but 80% is the low ballpark figure.
Attached below is STUMP's automatic periodic report about SCRM. It shows
that the rate for SCRM is about 88%.

How can that be? A good question. It can be because Misha submits
dozens of articles containing autogenerated garbage. He does it because
he does not like our newsgroup. We moderators have no other choice
but to reject these autogenerated articles because our charter prohibits
us from approving them.
To protect moderators from mailbombing our charter tells us to put
such mailbombers into our blacklist, which I do.
Once a month I remove Misha from our blacklist, and let him know that
he indeed had been removed. That usually results in another flood of
bogus submissions.
Apparently Misha likes it this way, and it probably lets him feel more
important than he really is. Well, if that is so, I have no problem with

This is actually inevitable. When people feel controlled, they do not come up with as many interesting ideas.
This is a cost of moderation. Whether it does or does not outweigh
the benefits (like some people not being fired) is a good question.
Some other fora, such as alt.pagan, were so drowned in trolls that
they simply could not conduct any meaningful discussions. For them, the benefit of moderation was creation of a place to talk.
What is important for freedom of speech is not the presence of "closed"
places like moderated cypherpunks, but the presence of "open" places
like cypherpunks-unedited. I'd probably subscribe to it, as long as its level of noise is tolerable.
The interesting thing that moderators will soon discover is that
competition between the moderated and the unedited list would lead
to so substantial improvement of the unedited list, that lots of
people will not feel a need for any moderation and will unsubscribe from
the moderated list and subscribe to the unmoderated one. Sandy & Co should not view it as their failure, but rather as their
success. What they want, hopefully, is not to be control freaks, but
to make readers better off. (and no one gets any worse off against their will)

I am getting tired now, but here is a proposed solution. You suspect
Prof. Sandfort in an intention to edit "unedited" list. You do not trust
administrators of toad.com. I hope though that there are people whom you somewhat trust.
If you trust me, or someone else, like Prof. Dave Hayes, here's what
we can do: I establish a sendmail alias cypherpunks at algebra.com that
expands to, say, your address and also cypherpunks at toad.com.
You can encourage all people, whom you expect to be censored on the
unedited list, to post through cypherpunks at algebra.com. I can even set up a little program that would digitally sign receipts of all messages
coming to cypherpunks at algebra.com. You and anyone else can receive such It means that you, Dale Thorn, in cooperation with other readers but
WITHOUT cooperation from toad.com, will be able to see which articles
sent through algebra.com finally made it to the unedited list. Not all
posters will use such service, but you can expect the "censored" people
to do so.
If you indeed notice an impropriety, the digitally signed receipts
will be your proof that articles were submitted. As long as the
other readers trust me (or Dave Hayes, or whoever volunteers), you will have a strong case even without relying on freudian slips.

@_subject: Numbers we cannot talk about 
It is very interesting. My limited understanding of this approach is
that they say that only things that can be constructed by some
positive method exist (please correct me if I am mistaken).
But the question is, where do they stop and what exactly is "construction?"
Say, does sqrt(2) "exist" in their sense of the world? We know we can
calculate any given number of digits in it, is that enough?
Some of the applications of these theories are very relevant. For
example, a theorem that proves that it is impossible to write a program
that would determine if any other program would stop or loop forever, is
very relevant and interesting.

All reals are equivalent to sequences of digits, but there are reals such that there is no algorithm to generate their digits.
It happens because there are "more" real numbers than algorithms.
I suggest the following mental exercise. FORGET FOR A MOMENT ABOUT REAL NUMBERS. Let's deal with mummies: DEFINITION: I define a mummy as possibly infinite sequence of
characters, separated by one dot, such that only characters abcdefghij
are allowed. Also, mummies that are represented by finite sequences of
characters are by this definition equivalent to mummies that end
with an infinite sequence of letters "a". END DEFINITION.
Examples: ae.cacacacacacaca... and so on.
Obviously, some of the mummies, such as c.cccccc... (with an ininite sequence of "c") CAN be generated by algorithms.
The interesting fact, that i will prove below, is that some of
them cannot be generated by any algorithm.
THEOREM: The set of mummies is more than countable
PROOF: if it is countable, we can construct a mummy that is not counted.
it is easy.
THEOREM: there are mummies such that there is no algorithm that
can print them. PROOF: the set of mummies is more than countable, the set of algorithms is countable, therefore there is no way to construct a one-to-one
correspondence between mummies and algorithms.
Do you agree?
Now let's back to the original problem of real numbers: the only
difference between mummies and real numbers is that digits 0123456789
are replaced by characters abcdefghij. Not a whole lot of difference, so everything that applies to mummies
applies to real numbers.

Jim, why don't you stop bullshitting and write a real assassination
bot. [as a beta, it can be a mailbombing bot] This bot would:
1) Accept bets as combinations of
           lose)
Note that for simplicity, the bot should identify the event as a unique string, without any understanding of any semantics of that
2) Store these bets in a database.
3) Have a trusted party (someone really honest, like myself) report to
the bot the signed strings that, in the opinion of the trusted party,
are "true".
4) Upon receipt of such event notifications, the bot will find all bets
and forward them to the better whose date prediction was the closest.
If several betters predicted the same date, the money is split between
them in proportion to the amount of moneys submitted.
Examples of use: Suppose I do not like The Right Reverend Colin James III,
cjames at cec-services.com. I have a lot of money, but do not know how to mailbomb. I set some nym address as my return address (for refunds if
CJ3 is not mailbombed within half a year).
I place a bet with $1000 worth of money and phrase "domain cec-services.com
disabled". The date would be open which means that I will always be the
loser. I also post a message (anonymously) saying that anyone who wants
to mailbomb TRRCJ3 can be rewarded through your assassination bot.
Someone with more knowledge of computers, a T1 link and no money will
be lured, submit a bet for, say, Feb 1, and on the 1st will start fierce mailbombing of cec-services.com. The return address will, of course, be
a nym.
The fact of mailbombing would become apparent when CEC-SERVICES's MX
DNS record is pulled off. The trusted party will send a phrase
(standardized) "domain cec-services.com disabled" to the bot. The bot
sends my money to the mailbomber through his nym address.
I estimate that this bot would take about 2000 lines of perl. You may need
to use some real database, like postgres or sybase.
Use a nym for it. It will take a while for this bot to develop a reputation (remember, there is real money involved!).

But, if Jim writes the bot well, puts it in an unknown place (remember,
all communications are done through remailers), he could die, but the
assassination bot would still work.
It may be an interesting problem: what steps are necessary to take to provide for the bot maintainers' sudden death in such a way that the bot
would survive for a long time (at least 10 years) w/o any maintenance?
Several things need to be done, such as running several versions of the
bot so that they could all communicate and work as hot standbys in case
one of the instances stops communicating; change their anonymous address
from time to time to deal with shut down remailers; probably slowly propagate as virii, so that killing them all would be hard; what else?
It could be done akin to Thompson's famous backdoor in /bin/login, as
a perpetual trojan horse.
How to prevent the bot's detection by sysadmins?

would survive for a long time (at least 10 years) w/o any maintenance?
Several things need to be done, such as running several versions of the
bot so that they could all communicate and work as hot standbys in case
one of the instances stops communicating; change their anonymous address
from time to time to deal with shut down remailers; probably slowly propagate as virii, so that killing them all would be hard; what else?
It could be done akin to Thompson's famous backdoor in /bin/login, as
a perpetual trojan horse.
How to prevent the bot's detection by sysadmins?

I doubt that anyone made this assertion. What Greg Broiles and Dr.
Grubor asserted was that because of the first amendment, the government
can not initiate an action in a libel case. Which means that libel is
not a crime. There may be some old statutes that declare libel a crime, as Greg noted, but they are not enforceable because of the first amendment.
Suits can be brought by private individuals though.
The government, even if it is defamed, cannot sue a private person for libel. For example, I can say that Congress regularly molests
small children, and they will not be able to do anything about me.

the As stated before, I have heard no convincing argument that it is in the consumers best interest to have an anonymous *vendor*. Sure it's vital that *consumers* be allowed to remain anonymous, but if you're selling a product or service, there's no legitimate reason why a business needs to remain anonymous given issues of warranties, product liability, sales taxes, etc.
And in the case above, since the remailer in question is simply acting as an agent for the business, there's no question of legitimate anonymity implicated. Indeed, perpetuating anonymity for the business often times facilitates activites that constitute a breach of contract and sometimes even fraud. The whole reason to use a pro-spam anon remailer is so that you can violate your ISP usage agreement without being traceable or accountable. And if you've entered into that contractual relationship with the ISP with the *intent* to breach that contract, it's fraud.
Anonymity for consumers, Yes!  Anonymity for vendors, NO!

There are patches that protect against this. The DOS attack that you mention
has been beaten to death in BugTraq and other places. It worked great until
all major OSes were patched. (of course some backwards sites still run
unpatched OSes)
It is very hard to protect against my attack, because it can only be done
at the application level. xinetd _may_ be helpful, though, if the service
being attacked is started from [x]inetd.
Yes, BUT most typically a new connection creates only a new file descriptor on the host, and a whole new process on the target host.

The program was designed specifically to be left running forever (in the

This brings up a question. Did these robbers kill him right after
they found out the answer, or they first tried to withdraw money
to check if his number was right?
This brings up a question on the strategy in this game.
Suppose I am captured by ruthless robbers. They ask me for a
number and torture me. They will torture me as long as necessary
until I give out the correct number, and then they kill me.
Assuming that I am rational and prefer torture to death, I should
not tell them the right number and delay the process, with the hope
that possibly the police will come and rescue me.
Assuming that robbers are rational and know that I am rational,
they certainly should not put me in such position: if they do,
they are going to waste a lot of precious time and have no chance of
getting the money.
So, they should promise me that they would not kill me.
But how would I believe them? A rational robber should kill the
victim after she gets the money.
I am not quite clear if rational people can get something out of
torturing other rational people. Maybe, I am confused and wrong
Maybe, if the robber can convince the victim that she (robber) is
irrational and would hold on to her promise not to kill him, she could
get the money. But how to do that?

Thanks for an interesting reply.
What if, for example, the prisoner convinced the robbers that he
was irrational and would swear to God that he would never give up
his PIN. Assume that he made a very credible promise, ie, the victim
is a known nut. Assume also that the victim is also able to convince
the robbers that he would not tell anything to the police.
The robbers would then face a choice: whether to kill the victim
and face murder charges with punishment M and probability Pm, or
not to kill the victim and face charges R (for Robbery) with probability Pr. Since the victim is not going to tell anybody,
Pr is zero. So they now choose not to kill the victim.
How can this victim make a credible promise not to tell the
I think that Jim Bell's assassination bot would solve this problem.
The victim would pledge $1,000,000 to the bot, with the instruction
to give it to the robbers if they are ever arrested within the statute
of limitations. After the statute expires, Jim Bell's bot would return the money back to the victim.
The AP bot could generally be a great tool for creating various
credible threats.

@_subject: Thoughtcrime   (Re: My War) 
How do you justify that "clearly"?
I think that your analysis is incorrect.
This is a supply and demand situation. It is very simple to show (as any
microeconomics textbook does) that a tax on the product reduces the amount
of product sold and produced.
Since a unit of product is probably one picture of a child, there are
less units produced if they are taxed.
In the case of child porn, all this persecution is a form of tax, although
not very quantifiable.

@_date: 1997-06-10 12:20:18
@_author: Igor Chudov @ home 
@_subject: Thoughtcrime   (Re: My War) 
An interesting point, Tim.
Your examples show that over time, demand and supply curves change. For
example, despite taxation, there are more people driving and they have
to drive farther because more people live in suburbs.
I would not be surprised if, when a certain product is taxed, its
consumption would increase over the long run due to many other factors
besides taxes.
The question that is more relevant is, what is the incremental impact
of the tax, that is, what would happen if the tax changed and all
things remained equal? (this may be called a short term impact of the tax)
An example to look at is online [adult] porn. It is, for all practical
purposes, not regulated. We see a humongous number of pornographic
images being created, not surprisingly, even though Lucky's argument
would suggest that there should not be such a variety if anyone can
freely copy them.
Yes, of course the price rises if a tax is imposed. The same econ 101
shows that if the demand is inelastic (as it is the case for drugs), the
buyers pay the bulk of the tax. So of course, the punitive laws
increased prices and made the business more lucrative. But the same laws
have also made drug trade more dangerous, because drug dealers risk to
go to jail and be shot by other dealers.
I would not be surprised to see that when the drug tax diminishes, the
drug use would go up. As a drug-free person, I do not care much about it
as, since drugs would be cheap, drug addicts will not have to kill
people to get a dose. And in the longer run, greater availability of the
images of drug addicts would probably have a good deterrent effect.
The cost of the drug tax to the society is all the inefficiencies
created by it: for example, when thousands of hard working business
people are locked up in expensive jails, it is a cost with little
offsetting benefit. The shootouts between gangs is also a cost insofar
as bystanders are involved.
Also, in an efficient system where people could buy crack at a Walgreens
counter, there would be less people involved in the whole business,
because Walgreens is more efficient at distribution than the inner city
drug dealers. As a result, these former drug dealers would be out of
business and be gainfully employed in some more productive trade.
Samuelson himself has "proven" some quite funny theorems.
Tim, let's compare child porn (with images of persons below 18 years
of age) with adult porn.
In other words, That should lead us to expect that without taxes, the number of 16 year
old pictures would be about the same as the number of 21 year old
pictures, give or take 50%.
And we indeed observe that The problem with cyclical products is high fixed costs and high exit costs.
Agricultural products are very specific because their production cannot
be easily changed when the future supply becomes certain. After all, you
can't kill all the little pigs or raze the corn crop and plant potatoes
in June, even  if you know that due to the weather there will be a lot
of it in the market.
Could not agree more.

I do not think that it is "on the verge", rather, it is there already.
I have a business plan. It presumes that I can RECEIVE cash
anonymously and operate in a certain city. As far as I understand,
a modification of existing protocols allows to implement anonymity of payees.
I open a trug trading center at, for example,
drugz at anonymous.mailserver.com. Alternatively, I can publish my public
key in alt.anonymous.messages.
Drug addicts would send me digital cash and specify which drugs they
wish to receive, and send me their public keys. I would place their
drugs in some random place in that city, and then send them (anonymously) the location of the place so that they can pick it up.
I do not see how I can be detected, modulo the security of anonymous
remailers. Since my reputation will be based on PGP authentication, I
will have an incentive not to cheat.
P.S. I do not believe that anon remailers provide an adequate security.

I am not so sure that it really was precision typing. (and would like to
look at evidence)
The paragraph above reminds me of The Right Reverend Colin James III.
He was also trying to combat elitist professors. That is a long and
happy story.
I think that a perfect spambot is possible and is a great exercise in
programming. It is also a cool and very creative idea, and as someone
suggested earlier, it can be created on the basis of cbcb. The net
result of the spambot would probably be a huge scandal and lots of
people leaving usenet. Some of them would be tenured professors. I see
few people who would benefit from it though.
Along the lines of poetry festivals and spambots, I may suggest this.
When I was 16, I wrote a prose writing program in Pascal. It read a long
text and created a table: as the key, it had pairs of words, and as the
data, it had list of all words that follow the pair in the index. The
table was generated by a single pass through the source text, where
there was a moving 3-word window and first two words were used as the
key to the third word. The window moves one word at a time.
The program then attempted to generate intelligent-sounding garbage, in
the following way. It started with a random pair of words from the
source text. It then looked up the table and selected(**) the word that
was most frequently used after these two. Then a moving window moved one
word right to the next and took the last word (which was just selected)
and the word before last as the key into the table, and did that ad The loop repeats indefinitely. The text that results looks like it was
written by a schizophrenic -- it is more or less correct grammatically,
uses more or less compatible words and seems to make sense, but the
meaning seems to evade the reader. It is an extremely strange and annoying
(**) The problem with this algorithm is that after a while, it starts
looping.  To fix that, the process of selection needs to be randomized
somewhat. The possibe randomizations are obvious.
To apply this to poetry and following-up spambots, it can do the
following [besides forging headers, etc]: for each message, read it,
create the table, and follow up with "I agree" and a schizophrenized
version of the quoted article.
It can also use USENET as a bigger source of the triples. I strongly
suggest to build one table per newsgroup and not mix diff. newsgroups
together.  This way, spambot posting to comp.lang.eiffel would talk
about Eiffel and contravariance, and a spambot posting to
soc.culture.russian would talk about lying homosexual purebred sovok
If we think about it for long enough time, this algorithm guarantees
that spambot-generated messages will always be on topic in the
newsgroups that are being spammed. That is going to perplex people very much.

@_subject: Technology and loss of freedom 
I have a thesis that it is the development of technology that has, over
the last 100 years, eroded the basis for and appreciation of human
freedom.  Technology has also done precious little for advancing human
freedoms (although cryptography may be an exception).
Let's first define freedom as the ability of people to do things without
forceful interference from the government. This is an arbitrary
definition, but it appears to be useful for the analysis below.
First of all, 200 years ago it was very hard for lone people to endanger
lives of themselves and many others. For example, the only weapons that
were available were single shot and double shot rifles that were very
slow to reload. Similarly, people did not have fast moving vehicles and
any traffic did not present serious danger for innocent bystanders.
Poison gases were not available, and the explosives technology
was far less advanced. Even if it was possible to set up a large
explosion, limitations in building construction made them useless.
"Hard drugs" also became available only in the recent past [please correct me] due to advancements in chemistry and medicine.
You can well imagine that airline terrorism could not appear before No doubt that I only touched upon a very small percentage of newly
existent dangers that are created by the technology.
At the same time, developments in technology made it easy to spy on and
brainwash citizens. TV, which is the ultimate brainwashing machine, came
in play only very recently. The wiretapping is new also. It is the
remoteness feature of "bugs" that made spying so much cheaper than
hiring "stukachi" -- snitches.
If you ride a horse, there is no perceived need for an airbag or a
mandatory horse insurance. If all houses are 1 story tall, nobody is afraid
of an OK City type explosion.
With the advent of technology, the balance of perceived social needs and
government capabilities shifted radically, and it shifted away from the
great freedoms of the past. The public perception of freedom now is that
freedom is inherently dangerous and is a threat to the public itself.
Is that an evil CoNspiRaCY of purebred sovoks and Zion agents or it is a
natural consequence of inventions that dramatically changed the place of
the man in the world? I am not sure.

Note that remailer users should admit the possibility of a government
agent being among remailer operators. I have very high regards to John
Perry personally, but believe me, it does not a lot of effort to subvert a more regular person. It is generally easy to find some
"crime" that normally would not be prosecuted and and then bullied
into submission.
A reasonably risk-averse remailer users should accept that probability and never assume that one or two remailers in a chain is enough for
anything serious. As well, I strongly object to remailer operators
openly discussing who sent what to whom (as it recently happened).
If a remailer operator discovers that a certain user is spamming his
service, he could publish a hash (not cryptographically strong) of the
offender's email address and not teh address itself.

I would like to thank Jay for his thorough and thoughtful comments. I agree with many of his point, and leave only those that I disagree on.

You are correct, there are tools allowing individuals to sign
their articles and verify electronic signatures. My moderation bot
STUMP even has built in support for PGP signature verification.
Some of its features are directly indended to be helpful for anonymous
users who want to not only post to newsgroups, but also maintain their
reputations. As you know, I think that anonymous users can be
great contributors to moderated newsgroups.
I am not sure that this article is the place to go into  a lot of detail
about these features, but I can summarize them for those who are interested.
However, there is a big and sticky question of what identity really is.
For example, I can establish several PGP keys and post anonymously using
all of them in turns.
What would be my identity? And if I use one of the keys to post off-topic articles and you "punish" that key not knowing that the same physical person uses several others, what's the point of such
That is not to say that using PGP signatures in moderated groups is
bad: it is great, especially since anonymous users who use PGP to sign their articles can be safely put to the preapproved list of robomoderator bots. The problem is that while we have IDENTIFICATION, there is little
we can to do enforce ACCOUNTABILITY.
* However, the current newsgroups where this issue has been raised are
* all robo-moderated purely for spam elimination.  That means that there
* must be some way to identify posters so they can be mechanically
* blocked if necessary.  Cryptography and/or valid e-mail addresses
* (whether those addresses actually show up in posts or not) are
* necessary for the filtering function to be totally bullet-proof.
I disagree with this point. First of all, forging email messages to
look like they come from non-anonymous addresses is very easy (just telnet
to port 25 and type 3 magic lines). Second, a person can secretly have multiple keys.
If someone is determined to bypass a robomoderation bot that does not
require EVERY preapproved poster to positively identify herself, they
will get through. By the way, I believe that most forgeries in moderated
groups are results of personal problems of posters AND moderators, and
moderators need to honestly take care of the underlying problems.
It is very hard if not impossible to deal with determined and
knowledgeable forgers. I would much rather ensure that they get
equal access to the group than try to fight them by technical means.

This is 99% correct, but not 100% correct. Newsgroups that are

Yes. It is an absolutely great method for newsgroup that do not
want to bother themselves with the costs of having a human moderator,
while at the same time eliminating spam and multiposted "flame"
We now have two bots, one of which is yours, that allow to quickly
set up such automoderated groups.
People who are determined to post off-topic articles to such groups have
very many ways of getting past the robomoderator bot.  That is usually
OK since it is not the regulars who are the problem.

Far from it.

But this is what they are looking for.
You hit the exact point on this one, TM. Patience is the asset
that hackers, moderators, and many others need the most.
See, a prudent sysadmin/user should do several things: 1. Keep the oldest backup at least several months old
2. Use encrypted filesystems that are mounted only when needed.
3. Disable all internet services.
4. Treat email as if it was certainly being read by your friends.
That does not make the computer secure, by any means (a bug in elm
or tin that causes them to coredump can be exploited without using any
internet services), but at least makes the threat of intrusion somewhat
less dire.
See, time is money. The stuff above requires a lot of it, so I wonder if your friend has a life.
You do not want to reinstall the system from backups...
Windoze is never secure. The only advantage of using Windoze is that the

useful, and hacking them is like breaking into outhouses -- not the
wisest way to spend time.

... snip ...
According to americal common law, as I understand it, no one can get
a valid title to the property from someone who did not have such title.
E.g., if you steal Vulis's car and then sell it to me, I will not have
the title to the car and will have to return it back to Vulis (and may
be able to try to recover my loss from you). The same will be true if
you lend the stolen car to me -- he can get it back if he proves that it
is his.
I find that reasoning to be quite good.
Lending stolen money (or stolen golden teeth) to banks is no different
than lending stolen cars.

The Swiss banks did not commit any crimes, or at least I do not see any
crimes having been committed. They simply (in my view, if the cold facts

to be returned to their owner or their owners' estates or something like
It is, like, if I buy a stolen car, as long as I was not aware or any
impropriety, I cannot be prosecuted (is that correct?). But the owner can take my car back regardless of how long I had it. It is not intended
to be a punishment, but rather a restoration of the original ownership.
This principle, among other things, seeks to discourage people from buying
stolen goods.

Seems like it is a matter of value judgment.
To stretch your values a bit, suppose that someone steals your car
and I buy it. Suppose also that I have bodyguards so that you would not be able to use force to take it back.
Would you be content if you could not (if the system worked according to
your values) sue to get the car back?
This is confiscation of property, ie, something that the owner has a title
to. A stolen car is not a property (as far as i understand it).

It is not hard, of course, but how should it be different from any other

It is not a "just another service" as you suggest below, it is

Actually, I think that it is important to add one more node to the

As far as I understand, you use these variables to select the particular encryption method. Do you normally select only one method on some random basis or you use several passes?
Also, some may be interested to look at this particular encryption
method (I added some indentation and comments for readability). I believe
that it is not particularly strong.

Tomorrow's Wall Street Journal: Sun Sells Encryption Software
           Overseas, Skirting U.S. Policy
           By DAVID BANK            Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
           MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun
           Microsystems Inc. plans to sell advanced
           data-security software from a Russian
           supplier to overseas customers, a move that
           skirts U.S. export regulations and is likely to
           receive close U.S. government scrutiny.
           Sun is expected to announce Monday that it
           will sell encryption software licensed from
           Elvis+ Co., a company formed by scientists
           from the former Soviet space program. Sun
I actually think that Elvis+ is mostly composed of the former KGB scientists, not space scientists. I may be mistaken though. -- igor
           has a 10% equity stake in the Russian firm.
           The Elvis+ products will be shipped to
           overseas customers from Sun distributors in
           third countries to keep them from falling
           under U.S. jurisdiction.
           Sun's move illustrates how global market
           pressures are making it increasingly difficult
           for U.S. officials to control the spread of
           advanced encryption hardware and software.
           The technology, which scrambles data to
           protect it from computer eavesdroppers, is
           considered vital to the growth of electronic
           commerce. But export of powerful encryption
           products is barred under U.S. export-control
           laws, on grounds that terrorists and others
           will use it to evade surveillance.
           Challenge to U.S. Policy
           The Sun action will cause the Clinton
           administration to face a difficult decision, said
           Jim Bidzos, president and chief executive of
           RSA Data Security Inc., a unit of Cambridge,
           Mass.-based Security Dynamics Technologies
           Inc., a major supplier of encryption
           technology. "The government has to shut this
           down, or else the competitors of Sun probably
           have to say, 'We're going to do the same
           thing,' " he said. Mr. Bidzos, a long-time
           critic of the export controls, praised Sun's
           move as "blatant and in-your-face."
           An administration official said Sunday the
           White House didn't have enough information
           to comment.
           Computer-industry executives, concerned
           that they could lose a valuable market to
           foreign competition, have long discussed
           strategies to exploit loopholes in the export
           laws. But Sun appears to be the first major
           company to use foreign software to supply
           overseas customers. Sun executives said they
           hadn't discussed the plans with U.S.
           government officials but had strictly adhered
           to current laws.
           "This is not being done to subvert
           export-control laws but to deliver solutions to
           customers," said Humphrey Polanen, general
           manager of Sun's network-security products
           group. "Never before have organizations
           outside of the United States had access to
           such advanced security software."
           Privacy advocates said Sun's initiative would
           boost their goal of making high-strength
           encryption widely available. "We think the
           benefit for security outweighs the liability for
           law enforcement," said Jerry Berman,
           executive director of the Center for
           Democracy and Technology in Washington,
           D.C.
           Critical Distinction
           Elvis+ is based in Zelenograd, a Moscow
           suburb that was once known as the "Soviet
           Silicon Valley." The company's products are
           based on a security protocol called SKIP that
           was developed by Sun, but Sun says it
           provided no technical assistance to the
           Russian company. The distinction is crucial;
           the export controls cover any product
           developed with such assistance from a U.S.
           company.
           The product, which will be marketed under
           the name SunScreen SKIP E, employs various
           encryption algorithms, or formulas, including
           so-called three-key triple DES and 128-bit
           ciphers, which security experts consider to be
           virtually unbreakable. The algorithms, in wide
           use within the U.S., are used to scramble
           digital communications; in general, the longer
           the bit length of the encryption key, the more
           difficult the code is to break.
           Current export controls allow the export of
           cryptography keys up to 40 bits, which have
           been cracked by computer hackers in as little
           as 10 minutes. Companies with special
           approval from the Commerce Department
           have recently begun exporting 56-bit
           encryption software, but customers have been
           clamoring for much stronger keys.
           Global Competition
           The restriction on U.S. exports has opened
           market opportunities for strong encryption
           products from foreign competitors, including
           Germany's Brokat Informationssysteme
           GmbH and Siemens Nixdorf
           Informationssysteme AG, a unit of Siemens
           AG.
           "Sun's announcement is further evidence that
           current U.S. policy is forcing companies to
           look overseas to obtain strong encryption,"
           said Edward Black, president of the Computer
           and Communications Industry Association, a
           Washington D.C., trade group that is lobbying
           for relaxation of the export controls.
           Last year, RSA Data Security announced
           plans to fund an effort by Chinese
           government scientists to develop strong
           encryption technology, but the effort has
           stalled, Mr. Bidzos said. RSA now sends
           legally exportable products to its Japanese
           subsidiary, RSA Japan, for bundling with
           Japanese encryption software. "I can't just let
           this world-wide global electronic-commerce
           market take off without participating," Mr.
           Bidzos said.
           Sun's Mr. Polanen said SunScreen SKIP E+
           will work with other products based on the
           SKIP protocols. A commercial version will be
           available in August; evaluation copies are
           available for download from an Elvis+ site on
           the World Wide Web. The software will be
           priced at $99 for versions that run on
           Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 3.1 and Windows
           95 operating systems and at $149 for the
           Windows NT version.

I see your point, Jay. What you are suggesting, probably not without
reason, is that the spam volume is not expected to be huge.
I may agree to that. The problem with this argument is that 1) No matter how much spam they get, posters have a legitimate
reason to protect themselves
2) Typically, altering the reply address is done before the newsreader is even started, changing it for only one censorous
newsgroup is a royal pain in the back
3) People should have freedom to post anonymously, especially on
such sensitive topic as cryonics
4) Anonymity is NOT a threat to moderated newsgroups

There is nothing good about this "accountability", and this is precisely
what I object to in the CFV.
There is no need for "accountability" in the moderated newsgroup.

That is correct. A moderated newsgroup can be set up such that messages
coming from certain addresses can be required to be digitally signed.
This requirement, of course, does not have to apply to all users and can
be done on a voluntary basis.
Anonymous users can also enjoy the benefits of authentication, if they
submit their public keys to the moderator (with the key address set
to something like space at alien.nowhere) and request that all messages
coming with the address "space at alien.nowhere" be authenticated.
This is a very positive aspect of moderated groups, since anonymous posters
can enjoy both anonymity and reputation.
The other concern here seems to be forgers who forge valid addresses of
existing users. Again, a moderated group has a great flexibility to introduce SOME authentication without even the need for using public
key cryptography.
The moderator can set up a password-based system. Anyone can request a password sent to them by sending an email to password at moderation.site.com.
A unique password will be generated, stored and sent back to the
requestor. The address that had been assigned the password gets on the
"watch list" and all article submissions from that address would be
checked for presence of the password. Of course, a password needs to be
wiped out from the message priot to teh approval.
As long as email remains private (ie, there is no man in the middle or any
sniffers acting), this scheme is secure. Again, it may be either purely voluntary or mandatory.
Of course, anonymous users need special treatment since they are unable to
receive email. Such users may continue to use PGP.

a lot of sites ignore everything that comes out of cyberpromo and affiliated domains. A user who decides to use a cyberpromo-hosted

I see no reason why the stockmarket should (or should not) continue

While having more options generally increases people's well being, we
have to expect a substantial amount of people whose investments will be

We may expect to the government to be under strong pressure to feed these

What bothers me most is what would happen if the market went bust again
as badly as it did in 1929-1934. I believe that it is by far not impossible. Then we'd get stuck in a market downturn, with millions of

The problem is that capital gains can be used to pay people money
and avoid income taxation.
Example: suppose that I hire you to design my website. Instead of
paying you $10,000, I sell you a security for $1,000 and repurchase it
from you next year for $12,000. As a result, you would not have to pay
the feds anything if there was no capital gains tax.
There are many ways in which this can be done by individuals and
companies alike.
I would rather use sales tax and repeal both capital gains tax and
income tax, than get rid of capital gains tax but not of the income tax.

I do not think that it is entirely impossible either, but the likely
scenario is that the government may first try to harass us and attempt
the criminal charges only after some time.
In any case, the present structure of cypherpunks list is entirely
unacceptable. We have only three working nodes. This is bad since all
of these nodes reside in the US and can be taken out easily.
Besides government raids, we are all too susceptible on things like internet providers kicking us out, hard drives failing, and so on.
Theree nodes is not a good redundancy.
I plead foreign cypherpunks to at least establish backup nodes that could
be turned on should anything happen to the US-based ones.

You are right, USENET is a good medium.
If cypherpunks list ever gets seriously harassed by authorities, migrating

actually prefer the list as the cypherpunks medium, it would be "nice" to
keep it working the way it is now if it is possible at all. The more likely scenario than gummint harassment, at least right now,
is a technical failure of one or two nodes. Adding more redundancy would
keep the list that we like more stable.

Florida State News

          20-NOV-97
          (TAMPA) -- Federal marshals and local deputies have shut down
          three Tampa area ``pirate'' radio stations, silencing unlicensed
          sources of rock music and far-right ideology. Authorities carted
          off broadcast and studio equipment from all three stations and
          dismantled a rooftop antenna that stood over one broadcaster's
          home. One of the stations was operated by 53-year-old Arthur
          Kobres, who is named in a 14- count indictment alleging
          violations of national broadcasting laws.  Authorities say
          Kobres used his equipment to broadcast anti-government messages.
          Also silenced was ``Tampa's Party Pirate,'' a 100-watt F-M
          station run by Doug Brewer. A third operator who was shut
          down... 22-year-old Kelly Benjamin... was also arrested for
          possession of marijuana.

Dear Friends,
As many of you no doubt know, a new moderated group,
comp.org.cauce, has been proposed. One of the main goals
of moderators is to prevent users of one-way anonymous
remailers and those who munge (alter) their addresses
to avoid being spammed, from posting to the group.
Their proposal would force users to reveal their Internet
identities and expose them to spam.
The proponents hope, apparently, that the more spam people
get, the more will they support CAUCE's statist lobbying for
more government regulations.
During the discussion they have shown complete disregard and
ignored all requests from users who attempted to help them
accommodate anonymous posting. To get more YES votes, they
removed the most controversial provisions from the charter, while IN THE SAME DAY promising that these provisions will still be enforced.
As someone who defends privacy and anonymity  on the Internet,
I ask you to vote on this important matter. I will vote NO
on this newsgroup.
Feel free to repost this message to any fora you deem appropriate.

How about reinforced metal sheet doors? THose are not supposed to be too
expensive and can be made to look pretty.
Are there any legal ramifications (like liability in case of death of
the intruders) if the homeowner gets out of the locked bedroom and shoots
the attackers? Depends on a safe, really.
My understanding of all this, which is pretty limited, is that safes are
a good idea for storing things when the homeowner is not home or does not
immediately control access to valuable things.

you is open to question.
I think that one more good way of doing it would not hurt.
So what if he reinvents something? Most of what high school and undergrad students do is learning and reinventing ideas that are already known. That
does not make study less exciting.
The interesting question that Nobuku can answer is how he generates the

[look at the last paragraph]
Former Army Clerk Sentenced for Cold War
             Espionage
             AP
             24-SEP-97
             PHILADELPHIA (AP) A former Army clerk at the National
             Security Agency was sentenced to 18 years in prison
             Wednesday for selling secrets to the Soviet Union three
             decades ago.
             Robert S. Lipka, 51, pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy to
             commit espionage. He was arrested last year after his
             ex-wife betrayed him.
             "I put this to rest many years ago, and I never dreamed it
             would come out like this," a tearful Lipka told U.S.
             District Judge Charles R.  Weiner. "I owe an apology to a
             lot of people."
             Lipka was trained as an intelligence analyst and had top
             security clearance with the NSA at Fort Meade, Md., where
             he was responsible for distributing and destroying
             classified documents.
             Between 1965 and 1967, Lipka photographed documents with a
             camera provided by the Soviets and dropped the film off in
             a park for up to $1,000 a drop, prosecutors said. He
             allegedly got a total of $27,000 from the KGB.
             In the late 1960s, Lipka told his then-wife, Patricia, that
             he was selling NSA materials to the Soviets. The couple
             married in 1966 and divorced in 1974.
             In 1993, after Lipka's wife went to authorities, Lipka
             recounted the arrangement for an FBI agent posing as a
             Soviet spy.
             After his arrest, the coin collector and gambler from
             Millersville threatened to reveal government secrets on the
             Internet if his case were not dropped.
             The judge also fined Lipka $10,000.

Meganet Corporation Ships Virtual Matrix Encryption Nationwide; New $1.2
Million Challenge Begins Today
LOS ANGELES, April 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Meganet Corporation, who challenged
Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT - news), Intel (Nasdaq: INTC - news), Dell
(Nasdaq: DELL - news), AT&T (NYSE: T - news), NCR (NYSE: NCR - news)
and many other high tech companies with their unbreakable encryption
is shipping VME98 nationwide. As of today, April 1st, 1998, anyone in
the continental United States of America can buy VME98 directly from
the Meganet web site at  Prices for the standard
edition are only $100 for a fully operational application.
After 12 months of Research & Development, Meganet Corporation completed
21 different commercial versions of VME98 last month, and the product
is now being sold nationwide through the World Wide Web.
Virtual Matrix Encryption is the strongest encryption available today,
and the product is available ONLY in the United States of America. For
the time being, there are no sales in any other countries, though Meganet
Corporation is considering applying for an export license.
Meganet Corporation also keeps on working on standardizing VME with the
different standards committees.
Meganet Corporation is also launching their 3rd challenge which is worth
$1.2 million over the next 12 months. Starting today, and for the next 12
months, Meganet Corporation will post a monthly $100,000 challenge for
registered users of VME98. This new challenge shows Meganet Corporation
has absolute confidence that VME98 is completely unbreakable.
Today's date also marks 1 year from the first 1 million dollar challenge
that brought Meganet Corporation nationwide recognition. The challenge
lasted 45 days and over 55,000 people participated. None have succeeded.
Today also marks the end of the second challenge which lasted over 6
months, where Meganet Corporation challenged the top 250 corporations
in the U.S. to test and break VME97. None have succeeded. The challenge
solution will be posted on the Meganet web site at Meganet Corporation has a U.S. patent pending for VME. The technology
uses a new field of encryption and a new algorithm to encrypt data
that is completely different from any existing method. VME is the only
algorithm that does not encrypt the data or transfer it. By comparing
the data to a random built-in Virtual Matrix, a system of pointers
is being created. These pointers are meaningless outside the context
of the matrix they belong to, while being repeatedly encrypted in a
plethora of algorithms. Even in the unlikely event that the algorithms
are compromised, the set of pointers discovered is completely unrelated
to the original data, and there is no way to derive the original data out
of the pointers set. The Virtual Matrix encryption enables the world's
first and only unbreakable encryption.

Encryption can be found at SOURCE: Meganet Corporation

With the current prices on AK clones being around $400, I expect that
their domestic manufacture will become profitable. In fact, as someone

Judging by their construction, there is not a lot of costs and they
should be a lot cheaper than AR-15s (against which I have almost nothing).

A surprising finding from New York Times:
Economists once believed that just 10 percent of all currency in
circulation was tied up in the underground economy. Now it turns out
that 80 percent is closer to the mark. Most of it is in $100 bills,
which are the largest available and now account for well over half the
value of the nation's paper money.
American banks and businesses hold very little cash. American
households are also loath to keep much of it lying around. Yet
according to the Federal Reserve there is enough currency floating
around to make it appear that every American family of four has
$6,000 or so in cash stashed under the mattress, including three
dozen $100 bills. And despite the ubiquitousness of credit cards,
ATMs and electronic transfers, the sea of cash has been growing
much faster than the nation's gross national product.

not. But Gary North is not worth listening to because he is biased and

I think that you had a good point... A long time ago I posted a "Skills
vs. guns" article to misc.survivalism. its point was, that in the long
run having good skills and health was more important than stocking up.
You can make semi-good "soap" from animal fat and ash.
No biggie.

Well... The answer is that there is much less washing needed for
survival than it is needed for day to day civilized American life.
For instance, I change my shirts every day. If shit hits the fan,
you can wear a shirt for two weeks. Similar story is with other
Come one, you can set up big latrines outside houses.
Well, yeah, of course. With pasta, you can make soup and eat the
water, too.
Well, yes, but still you need no more than 3 gallons of water,
which was my main contention.
It is entorely possible to live a decent life off of 3 gallons of
water per day. I am speaking out of my experience.
There is no problem with a properly set up outside toilet. There is a problem with eating unwashed food AND dirty hands.
To set up a toilet, dig a hole about 3-4 feet deep, fortify it
somewhat so that it would not cave in (for most soils fortification is
unnecessary). Then, build something above the hole so that people would
not be embarrassed to go there.
That's IT. Our country house in Russia used this system, it is reasonably
safe, etc. The whole neighborhood of houses used this system, as did
millions of other Russians. It _is_ safe. (Our apartment in Moscow had
a regular flush toilet bathroom).
A point I also made recently.
No, they were pretty nice. Not all of them agreed, but they had a
sensible discussion.
Ahh, thanks.

Why, shit is actually pretty compact. usually with latrines, the liquid
filtrates out, and the compressed shit does not take too much space.
If you dig a deep enough hole (2-3 yards) it should last for a long,
long time. I estimate that a human being produces about 1/2 to 1lb
of hard waste per day, some are more full of it, some less. Let's settle
on one lb per day.
Let's see, a hole that is 5 yards wide, 3 yards deep, and, say, 2 yards
wide, is about 30 cubic yards. It could take about 40 tons of hard
compressed waste, that is, 80 thousand man-days of shitting can be
compressed in it.
You definitely need some heavy machinery to dig this kind of hole
(and then you have to build smoe kind of frame over it to prevent people
from falling into it if it collapses), but it is not hard and can even
be done in a catastrophic scenario.
That's a lot!!! Let's see,a high rise building with 50 floors and 10
apartments in each floor, that's about 1200 people. The latrine would
last them what, about sixty days! And then they can dig another one.
Not in the short run. They could survive for a while.

One can configure a Sun workstation so that it looks, works and feels like
a Linux system, runs things like elm, fvwm2, vim, GNU utilities,

use one like that myself.
How many millions more of these do exist?

ship an OS where the Page Up key does not work with the default editor]

I do it by saving all messages that are likely to be spam to a separate

In the future such spam detection is going to become a lot harder. Perhaps
a system where the first time sender pays a refundable digital fee to

Firms said to agree on digital anti-piracy system
LOS ANGELES, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Five giants of the computer and
electronics industries have agreed on technology designed to protect
Hollywood's most valuable products from being illegally copied, a
newspaper reported on Thursday.
The Los Angeles Times said Sony Corp (NYSE:SNE - news; 6758.T), Intel
Corp(INTC - news), Matsushita Electric Industrial Co (MSES.KL), Toshiba
Corp (6502.T) and Hitachi Ltd (NYSE:HIT - news; 6501.T) were expected
to announce later on Thursday a proposal to deploy encryption technology
that will prevent people from making illicit copies of copyright digital
The deal could be a breakthrough for the entertainment industry, which
has been wary of the ease with which digitally distributed material can be
endlessly copied without any degradation in quality, the newspaper said.
``If somebody tries to violate a copyright, it won't work,'' the
newspaper quoted Mike Aymar, vice president of consumer products at Intel,
as saying.
``The goal is that you'll see products on the marketplace that support
this by the end of the year,'' Aymar said.
The proposed technology would have no effect on televisions, video
cassette recorders or computers already in use, the paper said.
It said the agreement was presented on Wednesday in Burbank, California,
to the Copy Protection Technical Working Group, a committee that is
led by major movie studios and includes representatives of the music,
computer, software and electronics industries.

@_subject: return.C -- performance tracking tool (fwd) 
I have been using this program for a while and decided to share it
with the other readers. It is written in C++.
This program calculates the total portfolio return.  It may be used
to find out an individual's stock picking performance and compare it
to some benchmark.
Right now it compiles under Unix, but I would expect it to work under
DOS and Win32 console interface. To compile it, type
This program was written because I was not satisfied with the existing
portfolio tracking websites due to their extremely limited and incorrect
It works by treating your investments as a "mutual fund". It tracks
the number of "shares" held. It means that additional cash infusions,
withdrawals, stock splits, sales of securities do not affect the per share
value. This is done so that the changing size of the portfolio would not
skew the estimate of the true performance of the stock picker. However,
dividends, fees and recorded capital appreciation do affect the per
share value.
Short sales are allowed by specifying a negative stock amount.
I strongly suggest that investors regularly record stock prices into their
transaction files (using the VAL operator) to monitor how they are doing.
It reads a text file that contains the record of transactions, and prices, and requests to print out the portfolio value.
# This is a typical file used to calculate total return.
# This file contains comments, marked by " characters,
# and transaction info.
# Transaction info consists of records of the following form:
# INV Amount                    -- tells how much was invested in Category
# PUR Ticker numshares share_price   -- stock purchase info
# SAL Ticker numshares share_price   -- stock sale
# DIV Ticker Amount                  -- how much dividend was received
# WDR Amount                         -- cash withdrawal
# VAL Ticker Amount                  -- Value per share
# SPL Ticker new_to_old              -- stock split
# FEE amount                         -- various fees (like margin loan #					interest, commission etc)
# (negative FEE means incoming cash, from e.g interest on the cash held
# by the broker)

First of all, the standard Dragunov scopes use weird Russian batteries

CNN Custom News:
          Repeat/Meganet's Unbreakable Virtual Matrix Encryption Takes
          the Market by Storm; Finally in 1998 Absolute Security...
          LA Times 02-JAN-98 LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 31,
          1997--Finally Meganet's highly acclaimed unbreakable encryption,
          Virtual Matrix Encryption (VME) is for sale. Meganet, a San
          Fernando Valley software development company, is proud to
          announce the release of a full line of encryption products.
          VME 98 is available in six (6) levels of front-end applications
          in three (3) flavors: DOS, Win 16 (Windows 3.x), and Win
          32 (Windows 95 & NT). The VME 98 Standard Edition, VME
          98 Professional Edition, VME 98 Enterprise Edition, VME 98
          Custom Client Edition, VME 98 Custom Server Edition, & VME 98
          Batch Server Edition provide unprecedented security, options,
          and flexibility. The pricing ranges from $100.00 for a single
          retail license to over $1,000,000.00 for the most sophisticated
          VME 98 Batch Server Edition.
          In addition, three (3) SDK's (Software Developer Kits) are
          ready to assist software developers in easily integrating
          VME 98 into their existing and future products. The three (3)
          SDK's include an 8bit DOS Engine, 16bit Windows DLL (Win 3.x)
          and 32bit Windows DLL (Win 95 & NT).
          The possibilities are endless with the array of VME 98
          products. Now any application including but not limited
          to Internet commerce, Government communications, banking
          transactions, corporate secrets and personal computer data
          can be guaranteed complete impenetrability.
          Yes, the VME 98 is the same product that was posted on the
          Internet with a $1 million reward for anyone that could break
          a VME encrypted file. Over fifty five thousand (55,000) tried
          with zero (0) success.
          Yes, the VME 98 is the same product that challenged Microsoft,
          IBM, AT&T, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, America Online,
          Netscape, etc. to break a VME encrypted file. All the great
          computer minds in this country have had an opportunity to
          dispel the bold claims of unbreakable encryption, yet none have.
          Meganet is pleased to offer the same standard of excellence
          with all of the VME 98 packages.

Police Report Stirs Up Militia Groups
          (MARTINSVILLE) -- A confidential state police report... which
          looked at the dangers of right-wing militia groups in
          Indiana... is causing a stir among elected officials and
          militia members in Morgan County. While the report discounts any
          immediate threat of terrorist attacks from Indiana militias, it
          does suggest that militia members are getting involved in local
          politics and may have too much influence in some areas. Morgan
          County commissioners think they're the ones referred to in
          the report... and they say they're offended at the implication
          they're controlled by any special interest group.

@_subject: Spam 
There are very good ways of filtering email, as well as methods
of "proper" exposure to email harvesting bots.
My suggestions are:
1. Create a "spam" mailbox that will be used to collect all email
that looks like spam. It is much easier to review this mailbox once in a
couple of days than to look at spam in the mail email mailbox.
2. Create one or more mailfolders for mailing lists you receive. Save
all mailing list messages to them. (you may want to save everything that was sent by *owner* as it is likely to be legitimate mailing
list messages).
3. Everything else that does NOT mention one of your legitimate addresses
is likely spam, and needs to be saves into the spam mailbox.
4. Keep a database of spamming patterns and spamming domains and save
everything matching these patterns to the spam mailbox. (my database is
attached below).
5. Post to USENET using an address that reaches you, but is different
from your email address.
Anything that comes in as sent to that address (usually Received: field contains the destination address) but does not start with Re: or is not
addressed to that address is spam, and needs to be saved into the spam
6. This will inevitably flag some legitimate messages as spam. Be careful
reviewing the spam mailbox.

@_subject: Distributed stock trading system 
I would like to hear your feedback on a project that I have just
thought about.
It is called a Distributed Asset Trading Network. It consists of
Traders and Nodes. They trade Products (asset classes). A Product may
be an Intel share, or a bond, or an option on S&P 500, or whatever. Who
and how defines what the Product unit is is beyond the scope of this
document. Each Node in the Network is a clearing corporation that is supposed
to be a legitimate operation. To cover possible liabilities, Nodes can
post [ecash] bonds to each other. They are ultimately liable for all
counterparty defaults in Trades.
Traders are clients of Nodes. They have Accounts. To buy or sell Products,
they place Orders to these Nodes. The Nodes broadcast the Orders and
collect Potential Trades (opposing orders that have not been filled yet).
Nodes may have Policies that require Traders to meet certain requirements,
in order to avoid potential liability. (ie, to sell stock, you have to
have it on your Account, or have enough equity to cover the short sale
liabilities, etc).
The receiving Node has a short period of time (seconds) to decide which
counterparties and which amounts to choose. The sending Node acquires
Locks on the submitted Potential Trades and is liable to produce the
Asset (or Cash) if the positive response comes back within that time
This architecture can create a trading environment that is a) independent
of borders and national laws, at least to some extent and b) eliminates
certain forms of arbitrage, and c) more resistant to denial of service
attacks (??), and possibly eliminates the bid-ask spreads and a whole
lot of highly-paid intermediaries, and c) potentially increases privacy
for transactions.
The technical issues that are open, at the moment, are 1) clock
synchronization, 2) the need for a central authority to clear liability
issues and 3) potential denial of service attacks through acquiring too
many locks (again, maybe with the proper liability agreement, it is not
an issue).
I think that such a system is not all that impossible to develop. Whether
it will, or can be made to, work in the technical and social environment
that we have is another question.
I am curious if something like this has aleready been implemented.
Thank you.

An interesting experiment is to mix the ordinary ammonium nitrate
(a fertilizer) with room temp. water. Try to put in as much ammonium
nitrate as it is possible to dissolve.
You will see the temperature of the mixture DROP to below the freezing
point (for pure water that is).
Wow. I did that 12 years ago and was amazed. A really easy way to get

I did understand the above, but thanks anyway Eric. What I still do not
understand though is what happens between the water and ammonium nitrate
that consumes so much energy. I mean, okay, you need to spend energy to mix these two things. Then,
logically, they should not "want" to mix, right? But empirically,
ammonuim nitrate literally sucks water vapors from the air. How come?

Web Investment Con Artists Prove
              Elusive, Insufferable to Regulators
              By RIVKA TADJER               Special to THE WALL STREET JOURNAL INTERACTIVE EDITION
              When it comes to con artists who target individual investors,
              none are proving to be more elusive -- or more infuriating
              -- to federal regulators than Internet scammers.
              The explosion of Internet investment fraud has prompted
              the Federal Trade Commission, in cooperation with the
              Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of
              Justice, and Federal Bureau of Investigation, to coordinate
              elaborate surveillance tactics to combat these on-line con
              artists, says Paul Luehr, attorney and chairman of the FTC
              Internet Coordinating committee, which oversees law
              enforcement.
              Although many investors are becoming more savvy about
              dubious investment claims posted on the Web, fraud still
              abounds. Investors who use the Internet for research and
              discussion need a healthy dose of skepticism when visiting
              any investment Web site.
              Barry White, a 40-year-old CPA in Charlotte, N.C., and,
              ironically, now a fraud examiner, says he learned this lesson
              the hard way. Last year, he became the victim of what the
              FTC called "an elaborate, electronic version of a chain
              letter" called Fortuna Alliance. But he thought his
              nightmare was finally over when the FTC in the spring of
              1997 nabbed the operators of Fortuna Alliance and shut
              down its Web site.
              Customers of Fortuna Alliance, the Bellingham, Wash.,
              company charged with conducting the operation, were told
              that if they "invested" between $250 and $1,750 a month,
              they could get back $5,250 monthly. Fortuna Alliance took
              in at least $5 million from people like Mr. White, according
              to the FTC.
              Mr. White had been optimistic that with the FTC on the
              case, he might actually get back some of the $5,000 he sunk
              into Fortuna Alliance's pyramid scheme. But now he's
              losing hope. And he has discovered that the operators of the
              on-line scam are back in business.
              The principals of Fortuna are now living offshore in Antigua
              and have set up a new Web site ( says Susan
              Grant, director of the National Consumers League Internet
              Fraud Watch in Washington, whose mission is to use
              collective consumer opinion to influence business practices.
              The Fortuna site's operators are so brazen that they haven't
              even bothered to change the name, she says. Fortuna
              officials would not return phone calls.
                             "One thing is true about Web
                             scammers -- they are so arrogant.
                             Fortuna just put up a new Web site
                             recently and went back in business,"
                             she says, lamenting that "there will
                             always be plenty of people who don't
                             check with us or the FTC to see
                             whether there are law suits against an
                             investment site."
                             "I think it's pretty poor that the FTC
                             can't get them," says Mr. White, who
                             says he testified before a Senate
                             committee hearing on the matter of
                             Internet fraud last month "more for
                             community service at this point than
                             to actually get my money back. I don't
                             want other people to get screwed."
                             Indeed, law enforcement in
              cyberspace may be one of the toughest challenges
              government agencies face. "We're out there and making
              headway, but a global community where scams can pop up
              today and disappear tomorrow is a big job," says Mr. Luehr.
              The Fortuna Alliance Web site is a classic example. It's
              cheap to set up a new Web site under a slightly different
              name, and since there is no legal recourse for Internet
              service providers to judge what sort of sites they are hosting,
              the Fortuna principals could theoretically continue to
              operate indefinitely.
              One of the most frustrating problems for regulators is that
              individual investors often overlook important warning
              signals that are universal in scam Web sites. Mr. White, the
              investor, says he wasn't uncomfortable at all with sending
              his money order for $5,000 to Fortuna Alliance, even
              though he'd never once spoken to a Fortuna official about
              the details.
              "There were very detailed on-line documents that promised
              a 90-day money-back guarantee," he said. "They said they
              were launching a huge ad campaign ... and my return on
              investment would be quick."
              Two months later, Mr. White quite unexpectedly discovered
              he'd been scammed. "I just happened to put in the keyword
              'fraud' on one of the [Internet] search engines ... and news
              that the FTC had just shut them down popped up."
              Looking back, Mr. White says, he should have been tipped
              off that it was an Internet scam by one red flag: After many
              attempts he was never able to get a Fortuna representative
              on the phone after he made his initial investment.
              The good news for consumers, however, is that conducting
              due diligence on investment sites is extremely easy using the
              Internet. The National Consumers League, and the FTC,
              SEC, and FBI Web sites all have fraud watch updates that
              allow consumers to e-mail questions and file complaints
              on-line. This kind of interaction is crucial, experts say, to
              detecting Web fraud. "We follow leads and need as many tips
              ads we can get," says Mr. Luehr.
              The bad news, however, is that on-line cons can go
              undetected for years and new mutations of old cons that take
              advantage of the Internet technology are popping up all the
              time.
              "One way we see the investment scams mutating is the
              combination of loan fraud and pyramid schemes," says the
              National Consumers League's Ms. Grant. "The con artists
              make use of spam to get investors."
              She cites a recent Las Vegas pyramid scheme that promised
              a $59,000 loan for those who mail in $20. It works like this:
              An e-mail arrives offering a chance to apply for a loan that
              you'll never have to pay back. All you have to do is mail in a
              $20 "processing fee."
              Mr. Luehr of the FTC says investors who have already fallen
              for one on-line scam should be especially cautious. "These
              scammers sell lists of names -- like any marketers -- and
              the ones that have already been suckered are considered
              prime targets," Mr. Luehr says.
              Mr. White will vouch for that. "I get phone calls all the time
              now for new 'get-rich' investment opportunities," he says.
              He says other red flags for investment fraud are sites that
              demand money upfront, and those touting "money-making
              opportunities" that promise a quick return with minimal
              risk. Ms. Grant agrees these are the two top signs of an
              investment scam.
              But it is not always so simple. Con artists understand all too
              well the appeal of high-tech investments to investors
              world-wide as scammers capitalize on investors' desire to be
              in on the ground floor of the next Netscape. So many are
              turning to cloaking pyramid schemes in high-tech language,
              Mr. Luehr says.
              "FutureNet was a perfect example," he says. "They used
              buzzwords like WebTV to lure investors and give the
              products a legitimate-sounding air." Similar sounding
              technology names add to the confusion. For example, the
              name "WebTV" is so familiar to the average consumer that
              many fraud schemes involve giving products or companies
              names such as NetTV.
              "This is such a problem we have set up 'Operation Net Opp',
              which is a surveillance task force to watch out for precisely
              this sort of high-tech fraud," says Mr. Luehr.

@_subject: Electric power generators ? 
Hi there,
I saw an article posted about "shortages" of electric power generators
and other Y2K "survival" goods, such as grains in airtight drums. My
reading of the article gave me a feel that those products are bullshit
products geared towards naive losers, and can be easily replaced with
much cheaper products that can be bought at discount stores.
More careful reading of the article showed that only certain high power
diesel generators are scarce.
A visit to my local discount retailer has shown that there are 10KW
gasoline generators available for as little as $500. 10KW is far more than I would need in an emergency. (I will probably need about 2KW).
1) Aside from probably lower power, are those cheaper generators somehow
2) How reliable are those cheaper generators?
3) What is their expected lifetime, in hours of operation?
4) How hard is it to service them?
5) How do you connect them to the electric system, to properly use
them as backup? (this may be a stupid question, but I am not very familiar with American system of electric wiring).
6) How much gasoline do they consume if you draw 2KW power from them?
Thank you.

@_subject: Goldbach's Conjecture - a question about prime sums of odd numbers... 
Hold on right here, Jim.
Do you mean a sum of DIFFERENT primes?
Because any number greater than 1 can be represented as a sum of some 2s
and some 3s. E.g. 8 = 3+3+2, 9 = 3+3+3, 10 = 3+3+2+2, etc.
Since this is so boring, I assume that the primes must be different.
Well, take 11, for example, it cannot be repsesented as a sum of different
primes. It cannot, pure and simple.
So, the above hypothesis is incorrect. No need for high powered math here.
Why, let's say 5 = 3+2, it is a sum of an even number of primes.
I suggest that first "examination" should always include playing
with trivial examples.
If multiple instances are allowed, it is an enormously boring conjecture
for 5 grade school students.
any number above 1 may be represented as a sum of some 3s and some
2s. Big deal.

These conjectures are equivalent for numbers > 6. I think that the
discussion of whether numbers 4 and 6 can be expressed as sum of
two primes is completely uninteresting.
Also, since 6 = 3+3, I question why they put strict inequality (> 6)
in the definition on p 673. I think that they could say n > 4. Not that
it matters in any respect.
So I do not see them as "substantially" different, and the difference
between these conjectures does not lead us to any profound thoughts.

@_subject: A bit more on Goldbach's and Primes 
The "extension" is just a trivial consequence of the original conjecture.
Proof: Take any even number N >= 6.
According to the original conjecture, there are two prime numbers P1 and
P2 such that N=p1+p2.
Rewriting this: N = 2 + (p1-1) + (p2-1).
That is, two plus two evens that are each one less than a prime.
That's eighth grade math.
if it is not then it must have not been in the list of primes.
Your "technique" ASSUMES that you already know the "largest prime that
is smaller by at least 4".
Your observation is incorrect.
Consider x = 8.  x/ln(x) =~ 3.84, but the number of primes < 8 (2,3,5,7) is
4, that is more than 8/ln(8).
I suggest checking observations more carefully.

@_subject: Dr. Strangelove on the Y2K Opportunity 
I don't quite understand this.
Look at this from the standpoint of the person in control of the American
arsenal. The goal of this person, to me, seems to be prevention of American
deaths (perhaps by a threat of mutual annihilation).
You say that there is a possibility of a scenario A that some Russian
missiles may be launched accidentally, without a first attack from the US.
To prevent this, you suggest scenario B: a preventative attack against
Russia. I think that your scenario has a higher mathematical expectation
of the number of american deaths than waiting to see if Russians attack
Under scenario B, attack on Russia is a 100% probability event. The
conditional probability of a counterattack is high as well, with the
probability higher (in my judgment) than the probability of a _accidental_
unprovoked attack in scenario A. The conditional expectation of the number
of warheads reaching their targets, assuming that it is a authorized
retaliatory strike, is again higher (in my opinion) than the number of
warheads that would be launched accidentally.
What his means is that scenario B has a higher expectation of american
fatalities. I do not see a point in doing this.

Well... I think that dismissing someone's thoughts on the basis of
psychobabble is never a good idea. Gary North's psyche may or may not be
fucked up, but even fucked up people oftentimes come up with good ideas.
On the other hand, the above is a good observation that I happen to agree
with. If you browse misc.survivalism (a useful newsgroup) you would
see a lot of gunnuts who can't have a single good idea of their own,
except for inventing scenarios where their guns may become useful.
I am not suggesting that all gunnuts are stupid, or that it is imprudent
to own firearms to prepare for various contingencies, not at all. I am
even very much pro-second amendment.
But objectively, there is a large category of people who are bored
with their current lifestyle and gleefully expect a "total breakdown"
of the society so that they could shoot live man sized targets instead
of boring paper targets.
They are likely to be disappointed by Y2K, or so I expect. (again,
my expectation that social breakdown is not likely to happen does
not preclude me from reasonable preparations)
The interesting question that arises out of all this, is trying to
predict what these people's impact on the actual Y2K events would be.
Would there be a big number of unprovoked shootings at groups of blacks
who happen to walk down on a wrong street? How should people behave in
order not to get shot by mistake? Would those people contribute to any
unrest that could happen? Which areas are best avoided?

Charged with murder
Now, after spending a year behind bars on unrelated charges, Bar-Jonah
has been charged with murder in the death of 8-year-old Zachary Ramsay,
who vanished while walking to school in 1996. The boy's body has never
been found, Light said.
But an FBI encryption expert, who stumbled across a coded message among
Bar-Jonah's papers earlier this year, found what authorities now believe
was a kind of confession of cannibalism, Light said.
According to court documents, the carefully encoded messages contained
graphic phrases, including "Lunch is Served on the Patio with Roasted
Child," "Roasted Kid," and "Little Boy Stew."
In other writings, the 44-year-old Bar-Jonah, formerly known as David
Brown, exalted the virtues of his favorite meal, "gay blade," Light said,
a chilling statement that has led authorities to suspect that Zachary may
not have been the first of Bar-Jonah's victims to meet a violent end --
or to have been consumed by his killer.
"This could just be the tip of the iceberg," Light said.

You are correct, for the most part, but your statement does not apply

Maybe it is collapsing for companies who hire dozens of programmers

Did you mean "per impression or per click"? I am paid for both, t is a

I tried blicking doubleclick via DNS, it did not work well because of

A thoughtful message. Thanks. Basically my site absolutely relies
on cookies for several things, such as the linear algebra workbench,
standardized testing, and "My Homework". Maybe the desire to reject junkbusters users is due to my asshole
personality rather than arational business thinking. I think that Tim is
right, the clueless kiddos who visit algebra.com do not run junkbusters.

Maybe there is nothing special about my site. And I don't mind
junkbusters users going elsewhere. I just do not want them to waste my
precious bandwidth.
Well, they are pretty useless to me anyway.
They cannot use many features of my site without cookies anyway.
These features include a linear algebra workbench (a unique service
as far as I was able to determine), standardized testing, "My Homework"
and so on. These features store a lot of session information about the
users and use cookies to reference the stored data.
I am not interested in a war of wits. I think that if 1) I indeed
have a nmeasurable part of bandwidth being used by junkbusters users,
and 2) junkbusters are easy to detect, then I woul dlike to do it and
kick them out.
I do not have the mania grandioza to believe that Junkbusters will
do anything just because Algebra.com found a smart ass way to detect their

@_subject: Registering a moment of invention? 
I invented something that I consider quite valuable.
It is an idea for a mathematical method.
It already works as intended, in a business process.
I am not interested in patenting this shit, however, I want to make sure that
I get the credit for this invention when (if ever) it becomes publicly known.
So I would like some kind of real timestamping service. I would prefer
something meatspace based, like a notary or US mail based or whatever.
Any suggestions will be appreciated.

@_subject: stupid anthrax q: would microwaving your snail mail help? 
My guess would be that microwaving them will not help. Microwaves heat
up moist things by starting electric currents in them. Anthrax spores
are not moist and probably will not even heat up.
Try your regular stove. Set it to, say, 400 degrees and pray that the papers
will remain legible. I'd prbobably be more likely to be attacked by meteorites
or abducted by aliens than be anthraxed via mail, but *if* I had to sterilize mail,
I would use a stove.

@_subject: Is the minder CDR down? 
my cdr node algebra.com is up. It is perhaps the most aggressive node as
far as antispam measures go. It uses a lot of filters, some homemade,
some based on SpamAssassin (as of several days ago). It also refuses
all mail from China, Korea and a couple of other spam friendly countries.
It also does not carry any traffic that originates from ssz.com.
I used to be a lot more tolerant of spam before, but not any more.

@_subject: algebra.com becomes a more filtered node 
Just wanted to let everyone know that algebra.com is becoming a much more
filtered node. Two things to be aware of:
1. I use a lot more of general antispam filtering. I use several dns based spamhaus blackholes, a access control list from wirehub.net, and my own list
of spam patterns.
At request of other nodes, I can share what I do which at this point has become
rather effective. Spam that passes through other nodes is more difficult for
me to eliminate.
2. (more controversial). I eliminate all traffic that I receive from, or that was
sent to, one particular cypherpunk node, as well as everything that was sent
by the node's owner. Essentially all traffic that is related to that node goes
to the bit bucket. I am rather tired of both the content as well as the network
bandwidth consumed by that node. I send nothing to that node either.
The goal that I personally pursue is to make the list more readable to
me and to use less of my bandwodth. I am not even sure how many valid
addresses are subscribed to algebra.com, since I transferred a lot of
them to minder.net a while ago.

I can understand the argument that the parts of the shuttle are
government property, so their "conversion" to private property
may be criminal.
But astronauts are not government property. So if, let's say, a charred head falls into my backyard, then it would be legal for me
to put it into a jar with denaturate alcohol, as a souvenir, right?
