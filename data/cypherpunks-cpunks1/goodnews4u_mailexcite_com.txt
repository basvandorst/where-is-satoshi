Why Invest Now?
The 1982-1983 El Nino was the strongest of the century spreading floods and extreme weather across the vast stretches of the globe.  Total
combined losses to property and agriculture from weather related
catastrophes are estimated to have exceeded $10 billion.  The current El
Nino  has already surpassed the 1982-1983 event in magnitude and is expected
to have major impacts on world weather through the summer of How realistic is it that the grain option prices will move one 1982-1983 El NINO IMPACT ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS FUTURES PRICES
corn:        Nov. 1982-$2.165/bushel (low)      Aug. 1983-  (high)     $1.59 increase
soybeans:    Oct. 1982 $5.18/ bushel  (low)     Sep. 1983-  $9.60/ bushel
(high)    $4.42 increase
That's the past.  What does the future hold?
It remains to be seen if the 1997-1998 El Nino will duplicate the weather conditions that affected agriculture production around the globe in
1982-1983.  However, given the historically tight supplies and record demand
for corn and sobeans repectively, combined with the strength of the current
El Nino event along with grain prices starting out from multi-year lows,  it
is our opinion that there is the potential for dramatic price increases in
the futures and options prices of agricultural products.
