To Whom it may Concern:
hoped. It relies too heavily on the nym servers and the reliability of the
other remailers that it randomly selects. As you can tell by Raph's list,
middleman has not responded to a ping a ping in some time. I've been
looking at the process for several days now and have come to the
conclusion that it will probably never achieve a level of reliability that
will make it a reasonable remailer. With this in mind, I am formally
announcing the retirement of the middleman Type-II remailer. It was an
interesting experiment but it just didn't pan out.
