@_subject: we must be on someone\'s radar if  XENI \'s trolling 
Let's play a game: what is Xeni Jardin doing on this list?
(a) I'm a reporter who has no knowledge on this subject but hear that cypherpunks are "hot" and maybe I can snare a story.
(b) I'm a reporter who has no knowledge on this subject but hear that that cypherpunks are "hot" and maybe I can snare a story ... in the process of screwing some people (fuck 'em if they're smarter then me - isn't that your motto).
(c) I'm a reporter trolling for leads and since I fucked everyone over in the Alley and Valley & no one will give me the time of day, I better get some new leads - & these are just the people to screw over next.
Which is it? ... This time
