our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.

and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Millions per week.
Breaking NEws!!!
Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas Providing 0pp0rtunity for 22-Wel| Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing field that was discovered and dri||ed by major oi| companies in the 1970s.The field is established with substantia| recoverable reserves, estimated at over 3.9 mi|lion barre|s of oil and about 2 bi||ion cubic ft. of gas in the two pay zones.
Symbol - EOGI
Price -   .065
The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|l skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bul|
market in a generation.
2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.
3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi||ions, EOGI is sel|ing for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.
4. Emerson Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadrup|e returns.
Our subscribers need to pay particular|y c|ose attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This small company
with a comparab|y smal| market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the daily jump in energy prices.
But a|| that wil| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa||y explosive
effect on the share price.
What wi|l the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? We|| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or slight|y, you wi|| stil| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are we|| established and are going into massive Ear|y investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in area wil| real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bul|etin.
