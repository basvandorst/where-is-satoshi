@_subject: More threats from FOTM (Friends of Timmy May) 
nYEH KulTCHURnoo, I think is the vaguely phonetic spelling.
And I don't recall _where_ I remember that from.
{Something like "ne(o)cultorney," I think.
{> Does anyone remember the Russian word for "uncultured"?  It was
{> in one or two of Tom Clancy's books.

@_subject: slander and call for lawyers. :) 
{Well as much as it pains me to take Dimitri's side I doubt that any damages {can be proved by his statements on this list. My reasoning for this opinion {is as follows:
{A.  Dimitri is a nut, kook, ...ect. Definitely suffering from dimished {B. Everyone on the list is aware of point A.
BZZZZT.  Point A well taken.  Point B fails, unfortunately.  Brought to my attention not so long ago by a post something along the lines of
"I'll take it for granted that Timmy May is a wanker, but what about
the crypto stuff on this list."  You can't disregard that there is a constant rotation of subscribers to this list.
{C. So with A & B true when Dimitri makes his nutty statements they are taken {by the list as just that, nutty statements. You're correct, so long as it's someone that's been on the list for long enough to realize that DV appears to have a problem distinguishing
real information from his fantasies.
By the by, I'd be happy to spend a few bucks to defray those legal
expenses, if it actually comes to that.  Either that, or I'll be happy to supply the rolled-up newspaper to whack him upon the nose.

@_subject: Stop Spammers Today! 
{Dear cypherpunks;
Hey, it knows who we are!
{In the last few days I have received numerous email coming from you but with
{fake return addresses from messages posted on newsgroups.  I must have been
{targeted because I am a bulk emailer.  Letting you know now that I am a
{legitimate bulk emailer compiling my list with the permission of each account
Er, does it mean that someone subscribed it to the list?
{If this barrage of email does not cease immediately, I will be forced to take
{legal and maybe not so legal actions to defend myself.
This from a 'bulk emailer'?  'scure me while I snort.  :snort:
Against whom, exactly, would you take legal action against?
Hey, PhneCards, perhaps someone that was on your email list that wasn't exactly pleased with your assumptions of 'permission' subscribed you?
Don't get any ideas about it having been me, or even someone actually
on the list, as we see enough of this garbage as it is, and would have
most probably subscribed you to a coredump or clueless list.
{If you would like to discuss this further, please call me at 407-438-8892.
How about 'unsubscribe cypherpunks' in the message body of an email to majordomo at toad.com, instead?

@_subject: Public Schools 
{I hate to burst any bubbles but, the school with the highest number of
{National Merit Finalists and highest number of 1600 SATs is a Public
{High School (Jefferson High in Fairfax, VA)
Er, how about the schools with the highest percentages, not the largest
number?  A public school will most certainly have more students than
home schools or private schools.
Every home schooled child I know has a significantly better grasp on
the world than any public or private schooled child.  Perhaps only
because their parents take a great interest in their education, but
the results stand out regardless.  Cypherpunk relevance?  Sure - what does the gubmint allow you to do?
What information are you allowed to learn, and from what authorized
sources?  How are those sources authorized?  Who stamps the seal of
information approval upon those documents, and how do we know that
the information isn't simply a 'corrected' view of history (or physics,
or english language...)?  We don't, unless there are multiple channels
of information to compare against, from 'signed' by experts, to pseudonymous authors, to completely anonymous authors.  The only way
to be certain that your children learn about the way things _really_ are, is to allow for these sources.
