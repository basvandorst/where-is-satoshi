@_subject: Assassination Politics: Coming soon? 
It's been a number of years since Jim Bell wrote his infamous "Assassination
Politics" essay.  If someone were to try to implement the system today and not
share Jim Bell's fate, they would need absolute anonymity and security.  The
technical requirements for implementing the system are:
1. Anonymous and secure communication between the organization and the
contributors and guessors.
2. Anonymous payment system.
3. Anonymous public presense of the organization to solicit contributions and
display bounties to potential assassins.
At the time AP was written, only the first requirement could have been met using
the mixmaster remailer network.  The last two requirements were not yet
available.   However, two new systems, DMT and Freenet, could be used to meet
the anonymous payment and anonymous public presense requirements.
If someone did want to implement AP, would DMT/Yodel, Freenet, and Mixmaster be
good enough to keep the TLA's from shutting the system down?   --

@_subject: Compromised Remailers 
Quoting Bill Stewart :
A case-in-point on this is the admin of the Frog remailer in 2001.  He 'outted'
a user who chained a message through both of Frog admin's remailers.  The admin
didn't like what was said and used his logs to match the sender with the
decrypted outgoing message.  With sendmail and verbose Mixmaster logs, this is
trivial to do.  It's also not unheard of for remops to log and cooperate to
'out' a spammer.
If I were remailing a message that would get me sent to prison, I would
definately use a Wi-Fi hotspot and use 3-4 chained remailers with random delays.
 By the time the message is delivered, it will be many hours/days since the
message was sent.
