You've seen or heard the commercial, "Hooked on Phonics, it worked for me, ABCDEFG" right?
Well, check out this Award-Winning Presidential T-Shirt, VOTED the Funniest Presidential T-Shirt of ALL TIME!
It has a Big Full-Color graphic on the back of The President in a Tux, playing his Saxaphone, with musical notes Flying out of it.  But what's that I see?!?  No way!!!  There are big Smoke Rings Flying out of his Sax! ...and The President is saying,
                 HOOKED ON BONG HITS
                  IT WORKED FOR ME!
The exclamation point is actually a Burning Joint!
On the front of the T-Shirt is a small chest print with children's blocks colored in Every Color of the Rainbow, just like the ABCDEFG blocks in the commercial... only they say "THCYA", as in THC 'YA or SEE 'YA LATER!  Underneath the blocks are the words "INHALE TO THE CHIEF" hovering atop another Joint! The Hooked On Bong Hits T-Shirt was hand silk-screened in the U.S.A. on the finest quality Fruit of the Loom(tm) 100% Cotton Heavy-Weight Tee and was previously available at Woodstock '94, Grateful Dead shows, Newbury Comics and numerous Smoke, Joke, and T-Shirt shops across the United States for $24.95 + local sales tax, but they sold ALL they had left!  You can't find these One of a KIND T-Shirts in stores anymore.  Now, for a limited time only, you can buy one HOOKED ON BONG T-shirt Factory Direct for $15.95 or TWO for ONLY $24.95!  Sorry, but due to the HIGH demand for these T-Shirts, your order is limited to only TWO, so you MUST respond NOW, BEFORE supplies run out!  Don't miss out on this FINAL OPPORTUNITY to own the hottest selling T-Shirt in History!  It's the perfect gift for Mom or Dad, brother or sister, a friend, your political enemy, your neighbor, your co-worker, your boyfriend or girlfriend (the XLarge makes a great Night Shirt).
