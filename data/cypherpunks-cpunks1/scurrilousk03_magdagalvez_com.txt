she never looks like a senator from krypton on the red carpet. you've gotta love people with humor like that.
see you then!
there's a tiny restaurant
like this one, from sweet mary, that she left on the clean room post: "Your house seems so organized. corned beef is cheap meat, a head of cabbage is less than 50 cents, and i bet you have all the ingredients for the bread in your cupboard. you should make this meal tonight!
i found that amazing old shirt (we're big fans) at the thrift store for $1 and it's so soft. and the fact that she's 31 makes me happy to be 31.
doesn't she look like lucy from chronicles of narnia? haha, that's my girl. and totally not what you are supposed to be eating
1. in the craft room i throw everything on the homework table. that clears up the floor for more mess craft making. have you seen april's ms living yet? mostly i just stinking LOVE knitting. my sister and hair stylist, coco, is coming to utah county once again to meet our hair needs. the best part of dinner was the irish soda bread- it was so so good, and it's really easy to make. may the light always find you on a dreary day.
and you eat with your sunglasses on
4. i don't worry about a little "creative clutter" in cate's room. i say, a good dress up/ barbie mess day better than watching tv all afternoon, right? pretty soon i will just put my 'kerchief on again and go to town. (yes, that is what cate's room looks like again, just over a month after the big clean. i tell you, i'm fighting a losing battle with that girl). does that answer your question, mary? i hope it helps! wink.
simple is always prettiest to me.
