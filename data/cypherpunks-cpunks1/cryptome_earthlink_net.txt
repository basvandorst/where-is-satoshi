@_subject: <nettime> Leaks do an end around the media mix? 
Bear in mind that despite the blovia about 250,000 cables allegedly
to be released, only 2,017 have been made public, less than 1 percent.
Not in waves but in very slow drips with days when none appear despite
tongues drooling in expectation.
It remains to be seen what the full collection will reveal about the
first tiny biased batch which was apparently selected for highest dramatic impact and as the article states, controversy, in accord with Wikileaks'
intention, with ever greater hyperbolic bombshells since the fall of 2009.
A comprehensive grasp of the Cablegate-branded cache is yet to come,
for now only artful and dreadful extrapolation fed very carefully by WL and its media partners for commercial rewards -- rewards which they
admittedly relish bragging about yet continue to beg for more under
various schemes of imaginary threat and insistence on public protection
against boogeymen all too like themselves.
Due to the lack of transparency in Wikileaks and its MSM partners, all
of which claim confidentiality about their finances, sources, editorial
policy and complicity with authorities, and all of whom have refused to
provide to the public the raw, undoctored, unspun, files to which they
have full, privileged access, it is not possible to verify much of anything
that has been claimed by the Wikileaks business cartel hiding behind
public benefit cloaks -- typical of scoundrels. They presume to claim their trustworthiness compared to those they
allegedly oppose but do not disclose their own secrets, in effect
mirroring those they claim to challenge, in behavior, in braggardy,
in disdain for criticism, in vaunting their importance, in unceasing
appeal financial and, ye gads get in bed with the enemy, legislative protection to head off rather long-toothed conventional threats that are no different in vaporosity from opponents.
This lack of imagination by Wikileaks and cohorts could be excused
if it was seen as carnivalesque clownism. Or lower spinal stem advertisment. Or fey ignorant anti-intellectualism favored by bald
and shaggy maned continentals. Or Onion grade sophmoric halitosic humor. Or simply tawdry political cupidity. These are all successful, and thus highly reproducible in the abysmal standards of screedism, not to tar all honest journalists with this brush but very much to mastic
their editors, publishers and the investors jerking the strings of the craven wretches. To wit, old fart Pilger sucking Julian's pickle in The
New Statesman, aping Ellsberg's shamelessness. There will be those who will find gold among this dross, and to those
a salute, the venals will profit from your freely given investigation
which they will take credit for as Wikileaks has fucked Bradley
Manning and other sources kept secret nor for their safety but
for the benefit of the public fuckers.
Bear too in mind little light has been shed on secret operations of
authoritatives, Wikileaks among them, instead the informative
light has grown dimmer as the celebrity spotlights increase luminosity of the stars and their sucklings.

@_subject: <nettime> monitoring and surveillance 
Odd that the Weimar-Princeton announcement makes no mention of
scholars and researchers gathering, aggregating, mining and messing
with Internet users data under guise of investigating and analyzing
the world's greatest-ever spying machine by spying on the gullible
users "to protect them," the motto of secret agents forever.
Bundles of irresistable funding for that, indeed, alliances and
standards-setting bodies have been established to bless this villainy
and the finely-coutured apologists for the villainous institutions and
"leading" scholars.
Be sure tell the public right away with every media study announcement
about the spy agencies' multi-millions being distributed to eager
institutions to foster open source spying, spy training, covert spying
and camouflage thereof. Admire the spread of euphemistic "security
studies" and "surveillance studies" and "social media studies" and in
particular "open source studies." Even the spy agencies vaunt these
luser lures in their recruiting materials. High-tech seekers, media
mavens especially solicited by CIA University, rush to intern in home
bases of spies and pursue advanced degrees in their cash-rich outliers
in universities. Note who runs these social studies programs ever
adaptable to the king's coin.
Remember the invention by Plato of Socrates, a friendly fellow
favoring open discourse, to undergird the highly privileged
philosopher as king. Machiavelli adored Plato's conceit. Remember the
invention of philosophy to undergird dissimulation, wise faculty club
debate tea cup held with little finger poised just so to signal how
pleasurable it is to outsmart.
Meta surveillance studies presumably sanitizes the vile practice
of social studies long invested in codifying human behavior, first
as allegedly disinterested scholarship, then to repackage and sell
as means of political control to full-spectrum authoritatives ever
indebted to funding sources open and secret, especially the secret
which requires non-disclosure as a condition of scholarly bribery.
Dissimulation provides an escape from complicity, thank heavens for
duplictious obfuscation. "I had no idea my work would be used that
Here's a suggestion: if any use of scholarly research is ever used for
secret purposes the original scholars shall be hung until dead from
Alma Mater, left to rot as a signal of why secrecy is the greatest
threat to democracy.
Monitoring the extended use of scholarly research shall no longer
be forgiven by exculpatory sophistry. No more excusing the study of
complicity by deeper treachery of exploiting hard-up students to do
spies' "dirty work." Oops that is the name of a famous spy story
Odd that the illegality of data gathering on the Internet is never
admitted by overseers of the intellectual commonweal. Odd that privacy
policies are always taken "very seriously," but never disclosed as
