Perhaps he's sending out through the remailers...because he can. Its open to
the public. Or perhaps he's trying to get the word out about remailers also,
or perhaps no one but he knows why, and why is unimportant. You can always
make your remailers a private, pay per use club. Then you could control all
the *whys* *whens* and *hows*.
These people have invited the email, and the associated expense, by placing
a public email-to: button on their public www page. A more acurate analogy,
and to the point, would be if a business sends you a postage pre-paid
business reply card, that is blank, and invites your comments on the card.
They can hardly complain of the expense when people actually send it in,
even if they don't like the comments.
Seems anyone who followed the link can complain to the appropriate source.
Didn't see any disclaimers on the remailers requiring a *good reason* to use
them. Who would be this Judge of Sufficiently Good Reason? Perhaps you can
write an AI piece that can auto-detect good reason from *no good reason*...
What is the ratio of *pissed off people* to not pissed off people. Likely
less than 0.5% based on how many messages the Cpunks claim went out in a day.
The saying goes...There is Heat in the Kitchen...
Now now... forgery is a no-no. And someone always has the freedom to give up
their anonymity whenever they choose.

How would you know what the *intent* of these other people is in placing
mailme: tags on their public pages unless you have been to the specific
pages. You speak only for yourself, yet you try to imply that you speak for
everyone on the www who has placed a mailto: tag on their pages.
Would it make a difference if the message to the webmasters mailto: buttons
said "Nice webpages you have, when you get a moment check out my designs".
Remember the thread is about an Artist who sent out only his URL to
encourage visitors. This is and was a NON commercial site.
*Respectability* is subjective to the definer...
Without a disclaimer on the box stating specifically what cannot be placed
in it there can be no knowing what the boxholder finds of personal interest...

Of course, that would be for THEM to decide what they find interesting or
not. Every response to this thread always seems to impart some speculation
as to what other people might or might not find interesting. What one finds
of interest another may not so why don't we leave it up to the recipients
themselves instead of some self appointed censors. I'll decide whats
interesting to me, you decide what is interesting to you, and the senators
can decide whats interesting to them.
I'm sure that some senators/reps on the various endowment for the arts
committees, and or the technology oversight committees would have found
HipCrime's sight to be of some interest. Of course if it was a blurb of some
new mixmaster/remailer development, you would have found it of interest, so
lets stop trying to guess what other people want and speak for ourselves.
To you it may not seem appropriate, as its a subjective judgement, I'm sure
that some brown-shirted jack-booted gov't officials beleive that using a
remailer for any reason is inappropriate....thats what's great about this
world, we all have our own subjective beliefs.

@_subject: Exactly the point Lance... [Fwd: HipCrime and Art] 
Exactly the point, bingo!  The point is this, exactly what do YOU define as
*fucking shit* so that anyone who visits your page will know exactly what
they can and can't say to Lance Cottrell. We've determined that you don't
want to receive the HipCrime URL from your mailto: button. What about the
next visitor who comes across your page, how will they know exactly what you
do or do not find interesting? Will you put a lengthy *what I expect from
all correspondents who use my mailto: button* explanation on the page?
Perhaps a simple, *don't mail me unless I already know you and want to hear
what you have to say...* tag?
