...just to let all know, the November issue of PC Magazine mentions PGP in the Trends section.  (pg 29)
'....in fact, cryptography is included on the State Departments' list of
 weapons that could compromise the country's security.'
'..Despite attemps to keep the technology stateside, 84 products that employ Digital Encryption Standard (DES) are available overseas, says
the Software Publishers Association.  But the regulation has succeeded
in keeping U.S. companies out of the globabl marketplace.  And recently,
the makers of a software encryption program called Pretty Good Privacey(PGP)
have been investigated for possible export violations. (Both DES and PGP
are available on the Internet.)'
The article also talks some about Clipper, but nothing new to my ears.  The Skip-Jack algorithm is mentioned, and the fact that the NSA is keeping
mum on how it works.
