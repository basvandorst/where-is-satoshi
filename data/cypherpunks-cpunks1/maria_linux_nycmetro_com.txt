   Sunday September 21 4:40 AM EDT Senate Panel to Examine IRS Inside Out
   By Tabassum Zakaria
   WASHINGTON (Reuter) - The Senate Finance Committee is set to present
   the results of a six-month probe into the Internal Revenue Service
   which found a quota system that rewarded agents who brought in the
   cash.
   The committee, chaired by Delaware Republican Sen. William Roth, will
   hold three days of hearings next week intended to take a look at the
   tax collection agency from the inside out.
   The atmosphere will have a touch of cloak-and-dagger with one panel of
   IRS agents testifying behind a screen to keep their identities secret,
   some using voice distorting equipment. Extra metal detectors will be
   set up outside the hearing room.
   The committee investigation began in February after being allotted
   $250,000 for a year to conduct the review. Investigators received
   about 1,000 telephone calls, letters and e-mails from taxpayers and
   IRS agents, and four cases will be presented at the hearings Sept.
   23-25.
   "These people have horrendous power, granted by (Congress)...it's
   legitimate, but that's a big amount of power," a committee source, who
   spoke on condition of anonymity, said.
   "To be able to take a residence on nothing more than a couple of
   signatures," the source said, referring to the IRS's authority to
   confiscate cars, homes and other property from people who owe taxes.
   An IRS spokesman said the agency carried out the law as written by
   Congress and that if mistakes were made, it tried to correct them.
   "We hope that these hearings will constitute a fair and open review of
   how the IRS conducts itself in using the tools that the Congress has
   given us," the IRS spokesman said.
   "We deal with millions of taxpayers every year, and in the vast
   majority of cases taxpayers feel that they are treated courteously and
   professionally," he added.
   In contrast, the investigation found many taxpayers complained the IRS
   did not listen to them and assumed they were guilty and wanted to
   cheat on their tax returns.
   The investigation found an apparent quota system in which agents were
   asked to bring in a certain amount of dollars when they went out to
   collect taxes, which led to some stretching the truth on what people
   owed, the committee source said.
   Agents were rewarded in their careers if they closed a certain number
   of cases or filed a certain number of levies or liens. That offered
   incentives for agents to close out the easiest cases which tended to
   be people with fewer resources to defend themselves, the committee
   source said.
   Another "tip of the iceberg" finding was that some agents used
   falsified credentials so their real names would not be revealed in
   face-to-face situations. Those types of credentials are only supposed
   to be used by the Treasury Department's criminal division, the
   committee source said.
   "One of the things that Senator Roth has wanted to emphasize is that
   there are good employees at the IRS," Ginny Flynn, spokeswoman for
   Roth, said.
   In fiscal 1996, the IRS received almost 119 million individual tax
   returns and collected almost $1.4 trillion in taxes. At the end of
   last year, there were 15,153 revenue agents who conducted examinations
   and 7,472 revenue officers who did collections.
   Roth did not want the hearings to be used for political fodder --
   "this is not a reflection of the administration, this is a cultural
   problem," Flynn said.
   However other Republican lawmakers have been using attention on the
   IRS to make political points.
   Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, as chairman of the National
   Republican Senatorial Committee which raises funds, sent letters
   seeking contributions which said: "...consider this: your tax dollars
   are paying for seminars that teach IRS agents to treat you like a
   criminal!"

   Monday September 22 3:54 PM EDT Russia May Have 'Lost' Nuclear Bombs
   By Andrei Khalip
   MOSCOW (Reuter) - President Boris Yeltsin's former environmental
   safety adviser said in remarks published on Monday that some of
   Russia's portable nuclear bombs might indeed be missing, as asserted
   by another former Yeltsin aide.
   "The statement by Alexander Lebed concerning suitcases with nuclear
   bombs is definitely not groundless," academician Alexei Yablokov wrote
   in a letter to Novaya Gazeta weekly.
   The letter was written on September 9, days after Lebed, former
   presidential security adviser, told the CBS News "60 Minutes"
   programme that the Russian military had lost track of some of its
   nuclear weapons.
   He mentioned more than 100 suitcase-sized nuclear bombs, any one of
   which could kill up to 100,000 people.
   Defence Minister Igor Sergeyev insisted on Monday that Russia's
   nuclear arsenal was under firm control.
   "There are no concerns over this issue," Interfax news agency quoted
   him as saying. "The nuclear weapons are under permanent control." The
   minister appeared to be making a general remark and did not mention
   Yablokov or Lebed.
   Nuclear experts with international think-tanks have said in the past
   that Russia has strict control over its military nuclear sites and
   that they viewed nuclear bomb and missile theft as extremely unlikely.
   But they said there had been cases of theft of nuclear materials from
   power plants and scientific laboratories.
   Yablokov said the military might simply have no record of some of the
   portable nuclear bombs, which he said were made in the 1970s for the
   Soviet KGB for "terrorist purposes."
   "These nuclear charges were not registered by the Defence Ministry and
   as a result could have been dropped from the list of nuclear devices
   under international disarmament negotiations," Yablokov said.
   Yablokov, an outspoken advocate of environmental protection, also did
   not exclude that Russia carried out a nuclear test at its Arctic
   island of Novaya Zemlya last month.
   The United States said then it had detected a seismic event "with
   explosive characteristics" near the Novaya Zemlya test site, but
   Russian officials flatly denied any nuclear tests.
   They said Russia had voluntarily given up testing in 1992 and was
   sticking to this position.
   Yablokov's charges come at an embarrassing time for Russian officials,
   who are hosting U.S. Energy Secretary Federico Pena and Vice President
   Al Gore for wide-ranging talks due to include nuclear safety issues.
   Washington has more than once expressed concern over nuclear safety in
   Russia and what it called a possible transfer of Russian nuclear
   technologies to other countries, primarily Iran, which it views as a
   sponsor of international terrorism.
   Moscow says it is adhering strictly to its international nuclear
   non-proliferation obligations.
   Yablokov was sacked from Yeltsin's administration earlier this year.
   He had been in charge of environmental issues at top bodies of the
   former Soviet Union and Russia since 1989. He was chairman of
   Greenpeace-Soviet Union before 1990.
