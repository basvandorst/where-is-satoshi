Thought you should see some of the quotes in this:
Once the ID cards are issued, the authorities plan to require civilians
to register their weapons with the police. At that time, they will take
on the sensitive issue of who is allowed to keep guns in their homes.
"We haven't decided to go house to house yet," General Khan said, "but
we are studying how to do it." Officials said they hoped to carry out
the program across the country.
That compares with 100 reported cases of all serious crimes: robbery,
murder, drug smuggling and the like in the last two months. "This is not
a normal situation," Mr. Karim said. "When there are no guns in the
hands of people, the number of robberies will decrease. Right now, it's
a very difficult situation to control."
