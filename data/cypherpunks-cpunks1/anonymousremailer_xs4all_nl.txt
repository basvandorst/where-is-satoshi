@_subject: PGP Tools under Linux 
That's interesting, because I developed it under Linux and MS/DOS, and there
was a lot of trouble at the beginning with it not running on big-endian
machines. It sounds like whoever "fixed" it for sparcs broke it for
little-endian machines. The original should still be on ftp.csn.net; get it
there and it should work.
Get the original, test it, and post the results.
Some people have asked if I am still around. Yes, I am, and I'm thinking
about a major update of PGPTools. The update would involve getting out any
persistent bugs I can find, cleaning up the code and making it completely
reentrant, and replacing all 2.3a modules with 2.6.x modules so it is
patent-safe. It also needs some kind of exception handling for disk errors
and the like. A pass-through function for the disk access calls, and a way
of freeing all memory before a longjmp to bail out, for example.
Before doing this, I need to hear from the PGP development team. There have
been rumors of an upcoming PGP API, something similar to PGPTools. If this
is the case, let me know so I don't waste time writing an incompatible
version. If this is not the case, let me know so I can get started.
More information about NexusBucks, please. Is it for real? How many coins in
circulation? Have any services been bought with them yet? What is the
address of the Magic Money server? Is it fully automatic, or are messages
being manually processed?

@_subject: PGPTools bug 
This is a known problem in old versions, caused by this bug in fifo_destroy.    while(fb) {
    nfb=fb;     fifo_block_unlink(fb); /* Free the block */
    fb=nfb->next;          /* And then read it...oops */
    }
It's fixed like this in later versions.    while(fb) {
    nfb=fb->next;
    fifo_block_unlink(fb);
    fb=nfb;
    }
Get the latest version (10d I think) from ftp.csn.net, and download a file
called pgptlupd.zip. The update has the fixed fifo, among other things.
Don't use the earlier versions. They have bugs. Get my latest release, not
one that has been hacked by someone else.

I think such a scheme would be limited by how difficult it is to integrate
the remailer software into the Freenet mail routines.
Most Freenets (at least Toronto, Buffalo do) use a generic type of software,
Freeport, developed by the Cleveland Freenet. I'd need other's comments
as to how easy it is to configure the remailer software to integrate with
the Freeport software that you get a working remailer.
If that step is possible, then yes, it is certainly possible to set up a
guerilla remailer.

Both Cleveland and Buffalo, at last check simply require you to send in a
signed form (that you can capture when you log in) as to your age, address,
etc. No photo ID (ie Drivers license etc) is required so a phoney account is
relatively easy to set up.....I know...I had one on the Buffalo Freenet
until certain anarchistic activities got it canned :>.
However....here is another interesting point. I'm a Canadian, living
across the border basically from Buffalo and Cleveland. Not only would
the authorities be unable to do anything due to it being a phoney account,
but being across the border would also place me beyond the pale of the U.S.
authorities even if I actually was ever tracked down. All that would happen
is the account would be shut down.
Same for a U.S. resident utilizing the Toronto, Victoria or Ottawa Freenets.
Overall, this is an interesting concept and I'd be willing to give it a
shot. They key facet of it is whether we can configure the Freeport
software with the remailer software.....or vice-versa.

@_subject: Hows THIS For Some Human Interest! 
Its funny, but this girl I'm seeing will be getting some Internet training
in the near future for the gov't job she holds. And in the course of talking
about that this evening with her, I briefly chatted with her about cryptography
privacy and PGP.
But when we talked abit more on this subject, she revealed something I found to
be pretty interesting. It turns out that her old man was an MI6 operative
during WWII. That certainly caused me to raise my eyebrows a bit.
He evidently was one of MI6's operatives in Iraq and did some pretty lethal
shit. Apparently he was involved in some economic warfare (whatever the hell
that means) aginast Axis interests in the area.She told me he still clams up
REAL good about his wartime experiences and it takes quite abit of coaxing to
get anything out of him. It sounds like his security clearance was pretty
reasonable.....likely in the secret/top secret category.
As somebody whose closest contact with an operative of an intelligence
service has been the cover of a Len Deighton novel, I found this awful
intriguing. MI6, from what I understand is one of the oldest and longest
running agencies around. I think they started up (offically) in 1910,
although Whitehall likely had some spooks earlier than that, given Britain's
colonial exposure. And indeed, MI6 is one of the best. Maybe even THE best?
Still, you can be damn sure I'm going to remain friends with this lady
for some time. What her father has to tell is probably pretty enlightening,
to say the least.

@_subject: (none)Re: Abuse and Remailer Ethics 
In article ,
This comment is grossly unfair.  Obviously Homer is going to a lot of
effort to operate his remailer in the best way possible.  It's easy for others to be critical.  "head on a plate" is a strong
term to use, given Homer made it clear he would not reveal the
identity of an anonymous user without a court order.  Also, one
wonders to what end remailers are being put by people who are worried
about being "sold out".
It's always been a good policy to use a foreign mailer in a chain
where anonymity is critically important.  That doesn't mean it's OK
to make Homer the whipping boy.
