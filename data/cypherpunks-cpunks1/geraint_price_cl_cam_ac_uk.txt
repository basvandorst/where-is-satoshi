This technology already exists in Britain (I don't know about any other countries), where you can buy a mobile without any subscription information off the shelf. To use the mobile, you go and purchase a 'token' which allows you to use the mobile on a pay-per-call basis much the same as a public phone. I don't know the method of token implementation.
The police have started kicking up a fuss over this technology as they claim it hinders their investigation into criminal activity, because if they trace a cellular phone which turns out to be one of this type then they can't pull the info on the customer to go round knocking on doors.
