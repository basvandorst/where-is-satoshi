On Dec 1, 10:45 pm, "L. Martin Ringler" It is not deliberate on our part.
A number of complications are likely to be present when trying to do
1. The phones may not have kernel support for it compiled in (or more
likely, some models will, while others wont).
2. I don't know if BATMAN does multicast (I suspect OLSR might, but I
really don't know).
I agree multicast is good here, but there are ways around this, even
if they aren't ideal.
In particular, if there is a mesh node at either end, then they can
(eventually) bridge traffic.
Some of this will become much simpler once we move to the overlay
mesh, at which point multicast will not be sensibly possible, anyway.
Actually, there are ways around this, and we are currently working on
exactly this kind of groups of people sharing information problem that
you mention.  We see no reason why our planned protocols shouldn't
work with multiple groups in the same physical area, even with
overlapping membership.
It is all in the clear at present.  We have plans to add voice, SMS
etc encryption and authentication in over coming months.
Mesh management traffic will remain en claire, but the overlay mesh
will increase the ability to authenticate even that.

============================== START ==============================
Hello Eugen,
About 95 EUR in Australia for the Huawei IDEOS (network locked, but
that doesn't matter for mesh networking) which ServalProject.org is
already using as a mesh telephony platform.
We also have PV panels that we can use with them.  The trick at the
moment is that if the phone goes flat, it won't turn back on by
itself; but I am sure some clever person can find a solution to that
This is particularly valuable if you wish to avoid purposeful
interference which is trying to take your mesh down.
Personally I think that plug computers, mobile phones and more
"ordinary" wifi devices like the VillageTelco.org Mesh Potato together
provide diversity and specialisation to various tasks and
appplications; no one solves all problems.  This is why I am
passionate that ServalProject.org phone software and VillageTelco.org
Mesh Potatoes be interoperable (which they are), and I hope, also that
they will interoperate with what this community generates.  This also
distributes the maintenance and leadership of these platforms further
removing single points of failure.

I am writing a paper at the moment that describes the solution in more
detail, but what we intend to do is use the public key in a Curve25519
auth-crypt cryptosystem that is a recipient's network address on a
Serval network to encrypt the message so that only the rightful
recipient can decrypt it.
Thus we are already planning to do what Breno suggested. Curve25519 is
a nice crypto system for this, because it is quite fast, which is good
for phones, and it is also very strong with relatively short keys (256
bits), offering something close to RSA2048 in terms of resistance to
known attacks.  On the down side, it has not been out very long, so we
might get exposed by some future vulnerability.
If the public key is not known, a fallback that offers deterrent value
only is to use the recipient's phone number to generate a hash that is
used as the basis of the encryption for the message, so that you need
to know the phone number the message is addressed to to receive it.
This isn't amazing protection, but it is better than nothing if the
public key is not known ahead of time.  We will warn users before
applying this fall-back scheme that there is basically no security.

Yes, so again this will be described in more detail in the white
paperI am working on, but the general idea is that each sender
maintains alist of all messages they have sent, which has a version
numberassociated with it in the Rhizome Manifest file.  If a
recipientalready has that version of the file, then it doesn't refetch
it.Else, it refetches the file.  We have a mechanism we have planned
butnot yet implemented where only the new part of the file gets
fetched,and also that expires the old part of the file that contains
alreadydelivered messages, together working to minimise network
So what happens here (or rather is planned, and being implementednow),
is that the recipients phone may issue a receipt that spreads inthe
same way as the original message. When the sender gets thereceipt,
they know the message was delivered, which also means thatthey can
advance the beginning point in their message log to excludethe
received message (assuming there are no others before it that arestill
pending).  That goes out in the form of an updated manifest fromthe
sender.  When the recipient sees this new manifest that doesn'tinclude
the original message, it can deduce that the message receiptwas
acknowledged, and it can advance it's starting point in itsmessage
file in the same way.  All this means that after a message isreceived,
it will phase out from being carried by devices on the mesh.
We are also planning various scope limiting features to stop
messagesflooding too far or for too long.
