@_subject: What are the available anonymous remailers? 
Hi all,
I saw the address for this list in Jeff Licquia's PGP FAQ.  I haven't
subscribed to it heard, as the FAQ said traffic on this list could be 30-40
messages a day.  As I'm attempting to cut down the time I spend on
Unfortunately, that means if you want to get a message to me, you'll have
to send it to me directly, you can't send it to the list.  My address is
atu5713 at compuserve.com
My public key is included in this message.
Anyway, here comes my real question.  I am interested in finding an
easy-to-use no-nonsense anonymous remailer.  But anon.penet.fi seems to
have shut down.  I sent mail to ping at anon.penet.fi and help at anon.penet.fi
and I got a undeliverable message.  Could someone point me to a remailer?

Hi all,
I am writing an article to help people understand the technical and

how the Fortezza chip works.
I have a 1993 document which is incomplete.  Is the session key K still

@_subject: What's the latest in factoring? 
Hi all,
First, I want to say that because I've heard that traffic on this list is
heavy, and I don't have time to file away 40 messages a day, you must
write to me personally in order for me to see the message.  My PGP key is
provided at the end of this message.
What is the latest factoring breakthrough (at least in the civilian
world?)  I had heard a while back that the most recent event was
accomplished by Samuel Wagstaff of Purdue University, whose team factored
(3^349-1)/2, which is a 167-digit number (about 552 bits).  Is there
anything more recent?  Also, whereas 1024 bits was the commonly accepted
threshhold for key lengths more than two years ago, what's the threshhold
now?  Because I have DOS (and like it) I use PGP 2.63ix, when should I
retire my 1024-bit key?  I don't expect anybody to answer that I should
do so immediately, but can someone give me an idea on what people are
doing in regard to key length?

Well, my opinion is only one of many, but I just finished installing
PGP 5.5 and it allows both RSA keys (max of 2048) as
well as DS/DHH keys (max of 4096).  Most keys I'm seeing these days
are running at 2048, so 1024 could be considered as
"below average".  Just my $0.02
First, I do have a 2048 RSA key I generated with 2.6.3ix, but its in
hibernation and not on a key server, yet. (g)
Second, what is 5.5 compared to 5.0?  Let alone 5.5.3 as displayed in your
key block?  Third, I think its arrogant that PGP Inc. (and many many other
software companies) have left dos/win 3.x users behind.  The people, like
me, who still use DOS/Win 3.x obviously like it, not to mention people not
in the USA.
Then, because of the lack of conventional encryption, and other options not
in pgp 5.0 (I don't know about 5.5), and because its not freeware (freeware
doesn't fully support RSA), people on the Internet had reached the
concensus that they weren't going to stop using pgp 2.6.xxxx.  When I
complained about 5.0, one person asked me if my 2.6.3ix version had stopped
working.  Anyway, I think that PGP Inc. should release a version of PGP for
DOS that lets you generate longer keys, be it RSA or otherwise.
Finally, there are a lot of people in other countries (where PGP has spread
as widely as in the US, if not more so) who are not compatible with Win95
users using PGP 5.0 freeware.

Dear Bill,
Sorry, but you may see this message twice.
There are two countervailing arguments about very long keys;
one is that if you understand cryptography well enough to evaluate the issue, you'll know you don't need to bother,
but the other is that if you don't understand crypto very well,
maybe you should be overly conservative.
Well, personally, I guess by your def I'm in the second group, since I
didn't know I don't need to bother.
Remember that factoring difficulty is roughly exponential;
adding logn bits about doubles the cracking workload (depending on which factoring method is being used).  Factoring a 1024-bit number is _much_ harder than factoring a 512-bit
number, and factoring a 2048-bit number is well into age-of-the-universe difficulty level.  The practical level of factoring right now
is about 512 bits, for either a distributed internet effort or
an NSA internal one;
I kind of knew this from a hypothesis, so PGP 5.x is being conservative,
possibly overly so by your definition.  I've seen a screen on a friend's
computer and the default is something like 2048.  By the way, we don't know
about NSA.  They may be able to factor any number, if they have an
in the unlikely event that Moore's law lets
us double processing power 100 times in the next 150 years,
that means a 1500-bit key could be crackable.  So 2048 bits
is certainly more than enough for _your_ lifetime.
Increasing processing power 2**100 times is likely to be tough :-)
After all, features in current microprocessors are on the order
of 100 atoms wide.  And by the time we've developed the level of nanotechnology needed to speed up processing that much,
there'll be tiny audio bugs listening to you type your passphrase
into your keyboard and reporting it back to the Central Intelligence
Corporation, or picking up the electromagnetic fields from your
direct neural interface, so the crypto strength won't matter much.
I believe in Moore's law, since in 1992-1993 I read an analysis that
Moore's law was true for the last 100 years.  I think its still true today.
 Your last set of thoughts is chilling, isn't it?
But consider this.  People 10, 20, 30 years ago like us are saying that the
government can eavesdrop on their communication in the future, just as you
are saying now.  Look now.  I am very proud that I am part of the e-crypto
revolution (my coined word).  I am helping to slow down NSA.  I hope that,
by the time the tech you hypothesize about is here, we again will have
technology to slow down NSA.
But do you really _need_ to factor the prime number to crack PGP?  No.
Remember that PGP uses the RSA key to encrypt session keys for IDEA,
or for signing MD5 hashes of documents, rather than using it directly.
So you can decrypt the message by cracking IDEA, or forge a message
by finding MD5 collisions.  Cracking IDEA's 128-bit keys was estimated
to be about as hard as factoring a 3100-bit number, though improvements
to factoring technology may make a 4096-bit number as easy as IDEA.
Also, PGP 2.x passphrases are encrypted with IDEA, so if they've
got your secring.pgp and can crack 4096-bit keys, you're toast,
I know this.  The point is that most if not all people know that RSA is the
weak link, not IDEA.  Would you rather start to work on a 1024-bit RSA key
or IDEA passphrase of an enemy?  Obviously the RSA key.  Barring any
mathematical weakness in IDEA, I am not worried about IDEA.  By the way, my
three-year-old info says that IDEA was being mathematicly attacked in many
quarters, civilian and non-civilian alike.  If they was anything, I would
have heard by now, but I still want to ask.  Has any significant
cryptanalysis attack against IDEA been "successful"?
even if your passphase isn't just your dog's name spelled backwards.
Similarly, by the time processing power doubles 100 times making your
1500-bit key insecure, MD5 will be long toasted.  Either way,
there's no need to go beyond 4096-bit keys ever, with old-style PGP.
Even if you're being overly conservative, that's more than enough.
You seem to be suggesting that MD5 will lead to the downfall of all of our
keys.  Let's think about your toasting of MD5.  The worst thing that can
happen to a one-way hash function is that it can go both ways.  So its dead
for signatures.  So let's suppose now that I can take any document and
produce another document with a higher or lower dollar figure in it and
come up with the same hash.  I can do this easily.  But to somehow exploit
MD5 to crack a passphrase it is impossible because you have nothing to
start working with.  You only have an encrypted key, encrypted with an
128-bit IDEA key.
Look, for our lifetimes, I don't see much point in going beyond 4096 bits
either, maybe even 3072.
Newer versions of PGP dump RSA and IDEA for patent reasons, but they also offer alternatives to IDEA and MD5 which may be stronger.
(SHA-1 is stronger than MD5, triple-DES requires immense amounts of
storage to reduce it to a strength similar to IDEA, and just being
extensible means you can replace algorithms that are obsolete.)
Triple-DES is not stronger than IDEA, although it is secure for the most
part.  According to Phil Zimmerman, its effective key length is 112 bits to
128 bits for IDEA.  Its also 3 times slower than DES, which is comparably
slow anyway.  Also, to settle this issue once and for all in my mind, the
Win95 version of PGP, what symetric algorithms do you have to choose from?
Does anyone have any comments on the relative strength of Blowfish?  What
about the mathematics of Blowfish?  Has anyone tried to cryptanalyze it
yet?  Also, I apologize for going on like this, I'll post a separate
question on that.
The other side of practical is how much work it takes to use long keys,
and how many people who want to talk to you use them.
The answer to the latter is "Not many" for RSA keys over 2048.
The former is about N**2 for decryption and N**3 for key generation,
and about linear for encryption with short exponents,
so it'll take you 64 times as long (once) to generate the key,
and 16 times as long to decrypt or sign anything, compared to
the far-more-than-strong-enough 2048-bit key, which is already
4 times as hard to use and 8 times as hard to generate as a 1024.
As I said, I have a 2048-bit key in hibernation.  I haven't posted it to a
key server, but a friend who recently got PGP decided to use my public key
ring, and use my 2048-bit key.  There are only two places in which this key
of mine is accessible.  Anyway, I don't see the 4 time slowdown for using
my secret key.  (I have a 133 MHz).  However, the effect is probably true
for slower processors.  I agree that we shouldn't bother with keys above
4096 bits because its not necessary and it takes too long to communicate
with people who have slower processors.
It's not worth the bother, unless you know have a really, really special application that needs to remain secret until long after
you've overthrown the government.  On the other hand,
at least the RSA patent will have expired by then :-)
I already addressed this point.
The Diffie-Hellman implementations in PGP 5.x will let you use
key lengths up to 4096, but the speed behaviour is a bit different.
In particular, key generation is much faster, so generating
overkill-length keys isn't as boring.
First of all, Win95 (not my computer) seems slow to me, even if that
person's processor is faster than mine.  And I hear so much disk reading or
writing, no wonder its slow.  Boring?  Win95 cannot make you bored.  Go do
something else, or play a MIDI file.  You can multi-task.

Good points.  But...
1.  Registration brings money, doesn't mean Bob should just blindly make
changes.  I'm sure that's not what you meant, but I had to say that.
2.  However, on the other token, if a nonregistered user makes suggestions
nicely, his suggestion should be debated (as we are doing here) and
considered by Bob.
