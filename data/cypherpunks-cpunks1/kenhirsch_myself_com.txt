What can you possibly mean by saying this?  You lose all credibility for
real criticism when you utter such inanities.  It's like comparing a
shoplifter with Jeffrey Dahmer.  Either you're ignorant of what Saddam is
about or you have no sense of proportion.
Or maybe I'm just not paying attention.  Was I not watching the news the
night when Bush, after seizing power, marched onto the floors of Congress in
front of cameras and had 21 top officials hauled off for summary execution,
as Saddam did in 1979?  (btw, the U.S. had nothing to do with Saddam taking
Did I miss it when Bush had Colin Powell's brother tortured to death, like
Saddam did with his foreign minister's son?
I must have missed the revelation of the prison where Bush is holding
children hostage, like Saddam's prison which was too horrible for Scott
Ritter to talk about.
I must have missed the testimony about Bush crippling and maiming children
with torture.
( or
I must have missed the thousands of political prisoners executed.  I must
have missed it when Bush invaded Canada AND Mexico.  I think my radio was
broken the day Bush gassed Berkeley.
Get a clue!  Check out Amnesty International's annual report on Iraq.
 or ANY OTHER YEAR!

Mainly it indicates how gullible you are when it comes to conspiracy theories.

Peter Fairbrother has said nothing inaccurate about completeness, whereas
your statements about completeness having to do with the ability to write
statements is nonsense.

@_subject: Who owns stuff that falls onto someone's property? 
I don't think there are any difficult legal issues involved.  If you drop your
wallet on someone's property, it is still your wallet.  If you crash your car onto
somebody's front yard, it's still your car (for better or worse).  If a plane
crashes carrying U.S. mail, the Post Office gathers up whatever mail it can find and
tries to deliver it.  Would you have it any other way?
Even if ownership was in question, does anybody really think it's a good idea to
sell the pieces of evidence while the accident investigation is going on?

@_subject: "Real Facts" and "Good Facts" 
There was an interesting article in the New York Times (
back in Nov 2001 about stenographers working on 9/11--that was an angle I didn't see
anywhere else.  When these special reports come on--and then go on and on and
on--the captioners don't get a break.   There are no commercials and they have to
keep typing even though the talking heads get to take turns.  On 9/11 it was even
worse because communications in NY were so screwed up.
Y'all are making a big deal about the "dangerous debris".  As you may have noticed,
there were very few real facts to report so they kept repeating the few tidbits they
had, whether they made sense or not.  The danger may well be overblown, but it is
just prudent of NASA to say not to touch it. There were some pretty big pieces that
fell and it is plausible they are still dangerous:
Good article from 1980 on the boondoggle that is the space shuttle:

In general you have to consider the whole system, including derivation
rules, not just the axioms, although you can certain start with a set of
axioms like:
{ x=1,  x=2}
or, come to think of it,
{ 1=2 }
Most famously, Frege's system was shown to be inconsistent by Russel.  More
recently, the first edition of Quine's Mathematical Logic (1940) was shown
to be inconsistent by Rosser.
For Frege, see "From Frege to Gvdel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic,
1879-1931" by Jean van Heijenoort

@_subject: Can one author a DVD with CSS included?  
The CSS keys are in an area of the disc that cannot be written to by any DVD
recorder.  Only the DVD-pressing machines can create CSS-protected discs.

@_subject: Can one author a DVD with CSS included?  
An authoring disc can be played like a regular disc and it has the
extra information that is needed to create a CSS disc, but it does not
actually have the CSS information in the place where standard DVD
players will read it.  To create an actual CSS-encrypted disc you need
to have a glass master created and DVDs pressed.
"It should be noted, however, that CSS encryption cannot be used with
either type of DVD-R media."

There's not a special exemption for reporters.  It is only a crime to reveal the
identity of covert agent if you learn of it because of authorized access to
classified information or your are engaged in "a pattern of activities intended to
identify and expose covert agents and with reason to believe that such activities
would impair or impede the foreign intelligence activities of the United States".
