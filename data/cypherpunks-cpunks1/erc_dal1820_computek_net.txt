So?  Companies lie all the time - the bigger the company, the bigger the lie, in my experience.  Companies are like governments - they will get away with what they can until caught.  Even then, they rarely stop - it just goes undercover.
Again, so?  All that it will do is to drive people away from Compu$erve into the arms of other service providers.  Maybe some of them will even figure out what a *real* ISP is...

Not at all -- but it's been *my* experience that people who rely on titles and degrees and such have very little else to recommend them.
I am as unenvious of Mr. Cohen as I am of Bruce Schneier - and Bruce has a
lot more of my respect.  Just because someone writes a "very innovative
thesis" on viruses doesn't mean they know diddly about anything else,
especially cryptography.  Where is Fred's paper?  I've got Bruce's book on
my shelf that I can read for myself and *that's* a classic in the field. When "I can read Fred's paper for myself, then I can judge the merits of
his degree.  Until then, I consider him no different than any other PhD
whose gotten themselves a degree and become convinced that the doctorate
entitles them to pontificate upon any and every subject under the sun as
though they knew absolutely everything about any subject that happens to
catch their fancy. Just remember - PhD means 'piled higher and deeper'.

No shit.
Uh-huh.  So, no one should ever use a computer ever again, if this nonsense is to be believed...
Oh?  So non-personal computers are secure?
The only thing that this post "dramatically proves" is that the poster is an idiot.  Double for his company.
Even LD was never this stupid.
Oh, yeah, please save me from my evil computer.  Give me a break.
Unless, of course, you use *our* products, services, etc.
So what?  Any first-year comp sci student could do the same.
First Virtual's apparant "intent" is to scare the public and panic people
into believing that they, and only they, have some sort of "magic bullet"
that will save us all from Evil Computer Geniuses.  Just another scam to
try and make money off of unsuspecting people by trying to scare them to death.  Just another version of the "Good Times Virus".
It is frankly difficult to overstate the idiocy of this post.
And the sky is falling, too...
Nonsense.  This also implies that Windows, MS-DOS, NT, etc., are all some sort of "insecure platform" and they are presumably infected from the start.  I suppose that when Bill Gates picks himself up off the floor from laughing, he just might send his lawyers after you.  Maybe.
Gee, why did I know this was coming?

I'm sure glad that you don't run this list, Perry, but it seems that you

attempts at censoring what *you* think is and isn't relevent to the list. I see it as a cypherpunk issue, insofar as it deals with the issues of
tracking down crackers, but I don't expect you to make the connection,
since I guess the word "encryption" didn't figure prominently in the post and the connection isn't immediately obvious to the most casual observer, causing you to foam at the mouth and gush all over the list about "the relevence to the cypherpunks list" nonsense.  Can someone please explain to me why *your* posts whining about the lack of relevence of certain posts are relevent?  Why don't you take your own advice?
I've got a better idea -- why don't you start your own list?  That way,
you can moderate to your heart's content and I don't have to see any more
whining messages from you about what is and isn't "relevent". Why don't you go and write some code?  Put those busy fingers to better

Well, that's the way the net is *now* - but it wasn't always so.  I remember the days when the net was composed of a *lot* of point-to-point UUCP connections eventually winding up at the backbone.  People could be many hops away from the backbone and still have email and news access.  True, there was no such thing as the web, nor TCP/IP, but we *did* have connectivity and communications.  If the Feds pulled the plug on the backbone, I can see that there are a lot of people who would drag UUCP and pathalias out of the closet, and the UUCP Mapping Project would live again (hams have their own backbone are would be not as severely affected by the backbone going away).

unattended/unmonitored entrance, so if you get a keycard, it's easy to get
into the place (my current employer has unattended entrances with
cameras).  Even with the manned entrances, the ones with just a
receptionist/secretary, they seldom check that the picture matches the one
on the badge, so even if they've invalidated the badge, the receptionist
will still more than likely let you into the place if you wave your

@_subject: ANNOUNCE: New Crypto Product! 
CompuScam, Inc., an unwholly-owned invention of InventiData, is pleased to
announce its latest offering in the growingly lucrative Internet Security
market.  Called "Secure Users Everywhere", SUE is "guaranteed privacy
protection for citizen-units everywhere," according to Ed Carp, Chief
Scientist, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Everything Else for
CompuScam.  In today's press release, Carp said that "SUE is destined to
become the dominant market leader in a field full of inferior products." SUE is designed to work in any environment, and provides "Fort Knox" security for Internet users who wish to transact business over the "net". "Up until now, the Internet has been totally exposed, totally wide open to
every 12-year-old wannabe cracker with a cheap PC and a modem," said Carp,
"but with SUE, all that has changed overnight.  Now SUE users can safely
and securely exchange the most sensitive of documents, including credit
card and checking account numbers, SSN, employee information, credit
reports, gold bars - virtually anything that is of value can now be safely
transported across the Internet." No details were immediately available on the technical foundations of SUE,
but Carp indicated that this is to provide enhanced security for its
customers, adding that "you wouldn't want everyone to see your data, would
you?  Then why would you want everyone to know about how this software
works?"  According to CompuScam, SUE is composed of a small software "TSR"
that is loaded into memory when a computer is first powered up, and a
proprietary hardware device, known as a CUD ("compulsive exteriorization
device") that provides "total security" for the software.  Carp indicated
that the software TSR is "completely ITAR/RNG/SHA/RC4/BBS/RSA/MD5
compliant, and meets all government standards for the very highest levels
of cryptographic software, including FIPS-180, SESAME, and STU-III."  The
hardware device is reportedly PRNG/RNG compliant.
Additionally, the SUE product is reportedly backwards-compatible with most
other manufacturer's "inferior" cryptographic products, including products
from Digital Pathworks, AT&T, VeriSign, IBM, and others.  Asked whether or
not SUE is compatible with electronic cash offerings from First Virtual
and others, Carp said, "Our total solution is so comprehensive, we're
fixed problems that even the National Security Agency hasn't thought of
yet.  We've also totally addressed the major problems that First Virtual
brought to light last month in their press release," adding that no other
cryptographic software maker had even responded to First Virtual's
announcement, "let alone done anything about it.  We are acting now to
protect our customers and children on the Internet by providing total
coverage of the market." Carp denied rumors that the CompuScam was nothing but a mailbox located in
a Mailboxes Etc., branch office in Garland.  "I believe you will find that
a reporter obtained an early press release which contained an
typographical error in our suite number," adding that the company is
expecting to move soon to new offices near Sun Microsystems in Palo Alto,
adding that "the proximity to so many Silicon Valley companies will no
doubt enhance the value of our
stock^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hquality of our software." When asked about the timing of the release, noting that it was only a few
days before the company was scheduled to go public, Carp said, "this is an
absolutely wonderful opportunity for investors to get in on the ground
floor of this new technology" adding something about a new Porsche which
the reporters didn't quite catch. SUE is available for PCs running all versions of Microsoft Windows,
Windows 95, Windows NT and MS-DOS, as well as all UNIX and UNIX-like
platforms, and MVS.  The CUD hardware device is available in .357, .45,
.44 Magnum, and 9MM versions.  Pricing was not immediately available.

A mobile system connects to any ISP, gets a login: prompt, enters "xyz at host.domain", gets thrown into a POP session on host.domain, uploads/downloads, then disconnects.

The problem, as I see it, is that you can have too much information. Information takes up room, takes up CPU cycles to process and store and
retrieve, and the worst part is, it takes a human to evaluate it.  No
computer in the world is going to be able to evaluate incoming humint for
reliability.  That takes a human, and I suspect that it will be that way
for quite some time.  The more information you gather, the worse the
problem gets, until you have this massive database of information, all
indexed and stuff, at your fingertips, but it's useless, because you can't
tell whether it's real or BS or disinformation. Ed Carp, N7EKG    			Ed.Carp at linux.org, ecarp at netcom.com

Tim May said in a recent missive, of which I've deleted (unfortunately)
that "most of us on the list are elitist" because we don't believe that
most people will make it, or some such (please correct or clarify, Tim?)
I would say that an "elitist" is one who believes that the masses (or the
great unwashed, depending on your point of view) are somehow "not
deserving" of surviving or "not worth it", and I would say that that
definition would *not* fit a great many people here.  I think that most
people here are *for* getting crypto out in the hands of *everyone* -
good, easy-to-use, cheap, uunbreakable (for all practical purposes,
anyway) crypto, to use for everything, ranging from telnet sessions to
email.  True, there will be some who will *not* make it into the future,
and those numbers vary (depending on whose vision of the future you
subscribe to), but the point is, those who do survive aren't somehow
*better* that those who do not - it may simply be that they are in the

It is?  Not by precedent, as far as I know.  By statute, yes.  I'd like to see some cites on this - the only reasonable cite that I know of concerning the ability of the government is the one back in the 40's (I think) that concerned someone possessing an "illegal shotgun" - and, of course, the pseudo-famous case regarding whether or not a convicted felon filling out certain government forms is protected by the 5th amendment.
Michael, can you point me in the general direction here?
Not *that's* a novel argument, one I hadn't heard before!  If true, this could cover a very wide variety of circumstances.  If I send my wife email from work and encrypt it, then that's the same as if I sent her a note in Farsi.  Interesting implications here... I wonder if there are any cases where, for example, the government took people to court during WWII to prevent them from talking in German or Japanese over the phone, or in letters?
I know you probably did this by hand, but I think in the dim mists of time, someone posted a program (to net.sources, no less!) that converts text into pig latin.  Of course, such a thing is almost trivial to write
but it would be interesting .
On the other hand, compression isn't illegal, but crypto is.  What's the difference?  Both render text in a form that is unreadable to the casual observer, and both require some effort on the part of the observer to Ed Carp, N7EKG    			Ed.Carp at linux.org, ecarp at netcom.com

The problem is, books aren't getting any cheaper, and to build a decent technical library takes several hundred dollars - not to mention the $200 or $300 a year it takes just to stay current.
Read lots of book reviews by people you trust. :) If I looked at every
book on the shelf that had the word "Internet" in the title, I'd be in the
bookstore from dawn till dusk.  There used to be two or three really good
books on VB on the shelves - and a couple of ones that I'd classify as
"fair".  Yesterday, I counted almost 50 different books on VB at Barnes &
Noble.  It's getting rediculous.  Like someone's claim to fame is they've

I just heard that Perry and Tim were picked up last night for public intoxication, after a hard night of partying and crypto-brainstorming.
OBCrypto: The arresting officer found in Perry's jacket pocket, a matchbook with what looked like mathematical symbols on it.  He didn't know what the symbols were, so he turned it over to the DP department.  I hear a couple of hours later, two "suits" showed up at the jail, asked to see the matchbook, took one look, turned pale, and spirited Perry and Tim out the back door of the jail.  The police profess no knowledge of the whereabouts of Tim or Perry - they say they never heard of them.  The arrest report has also apparantly disappeared.
The last thing one of the "suits" said was something like "they know about the hole in RSA we found with the quantum computer" - or that's what was reportedly said.  Something like that.

Check your screen resolution, and make sure it is displaying 256 colors or more.  If it's set to 16 colors, it *will* look like crap.  Also might want to check the Preferences property sheets in Netscape.

Anyone know how secure the encryption is that Microsoft uses in its Access database product?  I was asked that by a client, but didn't know the answer....thanks in advance.

Not quite.  Anything intended to hide the meaning of the message is banned.  Compression isn't banned, because the intention is to make more efficient use of the frequency, not to hide the meaning.

Perhaps the latter, but Zip drives come in two flavors: parallel and SCSI.  I have the SCSI version :)

@_subject: Freedom and Security 
Rather than repeat the whole argument, I'd like to point out something:
The 'threat' is non-existent - it's no longer a threat, but reality.  Why do you think that the government was so desperate to slide the CDA through?  Folks like the "CyberAngels" are the best friend of an intrusive government - they give them an excuse.
While before the CDA the government could read what they liked over the net, they really couldn't do much about it, because if they did, the ACLU and friends would've swooped down like a pack of starving dogs and devoured them alive (not that that would've been a *bad* thing, mind you).  Now, there's no excuse, and nothing to stop them - they have the *LAW* on their side.
The CDA just makes it legal.  The government is actually very interested in the USPS and others providing service over the net, because it makes their jobs a hell of a lot easier.  This "child pornography" argument is just a red herring - there has ALWAYS been this type of thing around, and always will be.  I notice much is made regarding legislating morality, but nothing is being said about the millions of tons of cocaine and heroin that the government brings in and sells to folks.  When people realize that the drug laws and this absurd "war on drugs" is just to drive the competition out of business - well, it's not going to be pretty.
And how about the enormous amounts of money made with the child slavery rings?  There is a LOT more of that going on than this "child porno" stuff - just ask Interpol.
As to the argument that we need cops and such - well, we did just fine for many years self-policing ourselves.  The spammer and such was either shouted down with mailbombs or just plain ignored.  Now, Suzie Q. gets an account, gets on IRC, and gets messaged by some freshman with no life, gets upset, and suddenly it's a federal case, attendant with the press smelling blood in the water, the morality cops like CyberAngels coming out of the woodwork in an attempt to get press, and the government rubbing their collective hands together, knowing that crap like this is just one more small step towards a police state.
I heard someone the other day say "what do you call it when only the police have guns? - a police state!"  Made me think.

@_subject: Why does the state still stand: 
That's why terrorism is so effective.  It only takes a few pounds of Sentex or C-4 to produce millions of dollars of damage.  It only takes the T's getting lucky *once* - we have to be lucky *all the time*.
Now, take that scenario and turn it around.  It only takes a little effort to frustrate the IRS, the FBI, or whoever your target happens to be.  The problem, however, is twofold - (1) the government will play mind games on the rest of the population to make you look like a terrorist, or whatever turns the populace against you, and (2) the government tends to use a sledgehammer to crack a walnut.  They don't care what kind of collateral damage they inflict (witness Waco and Ruby Ridge) as long as they can make their point.

I think it would help tremendously if elm or pine were hacked to allow for
remailing.  Even better would be some sort of dynamic remailer addressing
- sendmail certainly doesn't allow for this capability. :( I think we need
something similar to dynamic routing for remailers. Ed Carp, N7EKG    			Ed.Carp at linux.org, ecarp at netcom.com
