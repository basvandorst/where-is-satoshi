Do videotapes preserve the frequency of the fluctuations of incandescent lamps caused by the frequency of the electric
current?  Washington DC is at 60 Hz but according to  Afghanistan is at 50.

Given cipher output with bytes that look uniformly distributed,
it is easy to write a program that will transform the output
to a file having any desired distribution of bytes.  I've written
a program that makes the output look like transposition of English

The next time your on the streets with a lot of people, look around.

Despite the fact that domestic spying on Americans is already an
e-hoarding epidemic, the massive new NSA storage facility in Utah will
solve the problem of how to manage 20 terabytes a minute of intercepted
Even if the intercepted communication is AES encrypted and unbroken
today, all that stored data will be cracked some day. Then it too can be
data-mined. The super secret spook agency is full of code breakers.
"Remember," former intelligence official Binney stated, "a lot of
foreign government stuff we've never been able to break is 128 or less.
Break all that and you'll find out a lot more of what you didn't
know-stuff we've already stored-so there's an enormous amount of
information still in there." Binney added the NSA is "on the verge of
breaking a key encryption algorithm."
