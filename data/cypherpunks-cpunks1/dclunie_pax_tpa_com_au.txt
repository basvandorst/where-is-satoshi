@_subject: Random numbers 
It would seem to me that someone somewhere should produce a "random
number server" available via a well-known internet port number. Some
natural phenomenon not readily available to all could be used to generate
such numbers and one could just connect and ask for a number. It would be
interesting to try to devise means by which interception or sequencing
could be prevented.

Juding by what I read in "The Puzzle Palace" the other day, I gather no
such ban exists on the NSA doing this. Hardly seems to matter much
whether one has two "Big Brothers" watching over use or just one !
And the budget of the NSA is a hell of a lot bigger than the CIA.

The information may be classified, as perhaps it should be. If I were an
organization of any kind trying to protect my data I wouldn't run around
publicizing the details of the technology required to protect it either.
This does not mean though, that it is illegal to reinvent the wheel and
apply it yourself.
Besides, who is to say what is an "acceptable" level of EM radiation - the
government has clearly chosen what it considers acceptable levels to
facilitate equipment supply by contractors.
If you want more or less protection then you and any other member of the
public are free to define, manufacture or purchase whatever you want.
And if you can't get it from a local source I am sure there are plenty of
governments and manufacturers elsewhere in the world you can deal with,
though of course exporting the technology may be another matter, but there
is nothing new about that.
There are plenty of other government conspiracies to focus on ! This one
seems a bit lame.

@_subject: Remailer Policies 
The anonymous mailing system at pax has the following policy:
  - A log of activities of the remailing software is maintained when
    debugging is in progress (often) which could be used to correlate
    real identities with aliases - this is no more or less information
    than is available in the alias database which is not visible to
    anyone except the root user. Message-id's are NOT stored in this log,
    and the contents of messages and posts are NOT stored anywhere, nor
    are they scrutinized by me or anyone else. I don't care and I don't
    want to know. If someone does something unreasonable and I get
    complaints then I could lock out a particular source of mail if
    I didn't get a good explanation, but I am not going to go reading
    other peoples mail in order to censor it !
  - Under no circumstance short of being arrested and/or the equipment
    commandeered by someone else will the alias database be divulged
    or the contents or routes of messages deliberately intercepted.

@_subject: Some proposals, Anonymous mailers 
I strongly support this concept. Having just implemented a new anonymous
mail and posting system with privacy enhancement using PGP on a Unix
machine, using the existing PGP code which is very keyboard oriented,
proved to be a real headache, trying to second guess the responses that
pgp expected. The whole deal would have been much easier calling
library routines, or even more "Unix" like tool type interfaces.
I am seriously considering rewriting some bits of PGP to do what I need
but unfortunately:
1. I don't know anything about encryption, as Phil has made obvious in
   his responses to my ideas (quite rightly so).
2. A preliminary perusal of the code makes it obvious that extracting the
   functionality from the interface is not an easy task.
However, I would be happy to volunteer my services should no one Unix
based with more PGP or encryption experience is available. I also live
outside the US at present which is a plus I guess as far as RSA is
BTW. Re. my anonymous service - once I have Phil and Hal's suggestions
implemented feel free to use it. Send mail to "anon.info at pax.tpa.com.au".
The service is not yet really on-line, but if anyone wants to play with
it feel free (given the proviso that I might change things and take it
up and down periodically until I get it right; I will try to preserve
alias  and stored public keys that have already been sent along). It is
not based on the current perl scripts - I hacked it up in Bourne shell
scripts before I heard about other peoples efforts, so all bugs are mine !
Note that it is basically a typical anonymous mailing system like that
used in the various alt.personals and alt.sex groups, except that you
can encrypt your messages to it, and it will encrypt responses back to
you automatically, so dubious bounced mail and replies will not be
readable by other's at your site or on the path. At present it is set
up to allow posting to any group, but I am seriously considering blocking
out the k12 groups after the recent godiva fiasco, quite against my
philosophy, but my better judgement may yet prevail :( The same may go
for file size and even rapidly repeated messages to the same addresses
to prevent common patterns of "anonymous abuse". I hate to do this and
may not, but I get the impression that I would be foolish not to. The
immaturity of some people out there amazes me.
BTW. I have also started a new mailing list for discussion of anonymous
groups in general as well as my system. Send mail to "anon.subscribe@
pax.tpa.com.au" if you want to join. The list is strictly plaintext at
the moment though unfortunately !

Absolutely. This is a problem with any system that involves forwarding. For
instance the currently proposed scheme advocates encrypting the address
to be forwarded too, the remailer server still could have its mail
tapped and the same correlation made. Of course my system seems much weaker
in the sense that if the server is compromised the database is there for
all to see. Of course the other system is just as weak in that if its
server is compromised then someone can get the secret key that decrypts the
addresses using the pass key from the automated software that does the
My objective was not to provide a high grade of anonymity, rather to enhance
the functionality provided by existing anonymous services with privacy
enhanced mail. Specifically to avoid sysadmins reading your anonymous replies
which are often unsolicited and somewhat dubious or compromising. I think
it achieves the objective but is clearly not going to sustain a concerted
attack on the server by a knowledgeable assailant like the NSA or FBI or
their equivalents in this country.
To my knowledge, being very naive when it comes to encryption, the provision
of anonymity which does not depend on a particular site to do the remailing
(and is hence vulnerable as described) is much less straightforward, not to
mention inconvenient. Perhaps I am overlooking something obvious to someone
more knowledgeable.

@_subject: anonymous service shutdown (pax) 
I have had a fairly long discussion via email with the AARnnet administrator
He points out that wrongly or rightly (he believes wrongly) the AARNet
does not have an "open access" policy, and the network is setup exclusively
to service the university community. Public access systems are tolerated, but
barely, and mainly through the grace of those who administer the system
rather than those who fund it.
The complaint in question was actually not at all specific, and came not
from the NSF but from one of the NASA Internet officers who is responsible
for the US end of the link to Australia (and pay for some of it). Essentially
the complaint was one of increasing mail traffic on an already congested link
to the US, as well as concern about the "hiding people's identities so they
cannot be responsible for what they say".
Personally I disagree with the second complaint, but cannot dispute the first,
without statistsics about what component of the link was being consumed by
the posting service. I suspect it was very small but these things all add
It seems a shame that the anonymous system is being terminated "on principle"
but the AARNet person has been friendly about it, in fact positively
graceful in view of my somewhat inflammatory post, and so I guess I just
have to leave it there.
Hopefully eventually commercial vendors will provide an alternative channel
to the university-based network here currently, much as has happened in the
US over the years, and these questions will be less of a concern.

I am not familiar with the legal status of patents and software packages,
but it seems to me that they can sell you a program and license you to
use it, but forcing you to use one of their key servers instead of your
own seems pretty far fetched.
I would be very surprised if the law is clear cut on this issue, or has
ever been tested. I gather software licenses are pretty hazy territory at
the best of times without getting involved in patent law as well !@

@_subject: anonymous server compilation? 
Unfortunately, the anonymous sytem at pax has been closed, as the local
network in Australia was considered unsuitable for this kind of thing,
partly due to the narrow bandwidth of the link to the US, and partly because
of the prevailing attitude at the US end that anonymous mail is generally
a bad thing.

I gather some people have had trouble obtaining sources for PGP. I
have accumulated those I can and they are available from my mail
server. If you can get these somewhere closer then great, but
if desperate feel free to get them from here (as long as the load
doesn't get out of hand I will keep it going).
The address is "mail-server at pax.tpa.com.au".
Help is available by sending in the message body:
  send help
  end
An index of PGP files is available by sending in the message body:
  index pgp

Why not just ask him/her ?
And while you are at it, you could ask them why they developed such a policy.
Though you are obviously obliged to respect it, there is no harm in asking
them what their rationale is ... it would be nice to know whether the policy
was adopted on purely theoretical grounds or whether they were responding
to a specific pattern of misuse.
I also noticed that the policy you posted made no reference to the privacy
of plaintext email, or its lack thereof.
