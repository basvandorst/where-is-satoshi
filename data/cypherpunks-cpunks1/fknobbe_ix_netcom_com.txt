@_subject: Crack some code... 
Howdy folks.
Who would be willing to try to crack a code that I implemented in one of my programs? The file is a simple index file containing ASCII characters besides pointers.  If someone is interested in cracking that agorithm, simply send me a mail.  I'm curious of how good that algorithm is...
