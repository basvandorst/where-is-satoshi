Mail programs need, at the very least, text editors, or it becomes difficult to
compose.  Or do you mean that word processors should be integrated into mail
The real issue is a common format.  The fact that there is no common format more

I can, barely, and, no, I didn't.  But I get your point.
The card punching machines I used did a good job of punching a clean

punching equipment, the cards or both were faulty.  Maybe the butterfly
wasn't the only flaw in the design of the ballots.

weighed in.  And the electors haven't cast their votes yet.  So anyone claiming
victory already is clearly a "self-declared" winner.
