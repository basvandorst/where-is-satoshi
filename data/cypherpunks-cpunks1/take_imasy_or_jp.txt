@_subject: PGP commercial usage 
Few days ago I found good page for it.
  This page said that:
 + Can I use PGP 2.6.3i for commercial purposes?
 +  + Yes, you can, but you need to buy a separate license for the IDEA
algorithm used in
 + PGP. (RSA is not patented outside the US, so you don't need a license
for this
 + algorithm.) IDEA licenses can be purchased from Ascom Systec AG in
 + (The licensing of the IDEA algorithm was formerly administrated by Ascom
Tech, but
 + this responsibility has been transferred to Ascom Systec. Please, do not
 + Ascom Tech about this matter!) The fee is charged on a per-user basis as
follows: # Sorry, this is about 2.6.3i, not 2.6ui.
Now I'm studying MacPGP...
