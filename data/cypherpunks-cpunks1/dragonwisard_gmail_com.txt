@_subject: [Freedombox-discuss] Wireless routers "knitted" together 
Hash: SHA1
The paper they refer to acknowledges the recent research into using
ad-hoc mesh networks as a backup communication system for emergency
responders. They assert that mesh node density may be insufficient in
certain geographic areas to maintain the necessary coverage of the mesh.
Based on this assertion, they are proposing that "at some point in the
future" an emergency switch would be implemented into all (or most?)
home routers such that the could be flipped from normal mode into an
emergency mesh network mode granting access to emergency responders.
They then proceed to use an Android wardriving app to collect data on
existing residential WiFi-enabled routers one neighborhood and make the
case that these routers would be capable of running the necessary
software to form a mesh network with consistent coverage of that
Although the paper appears to be well-researched and well-written, I
think they focus too much on the wardriving aspect and trying to
establish the proliferation of privately owned WiFi equipment in a
particular urban neighborhood in a well-developed country. There is a
lot of important discussion which they seem to leave out of this paper.
They may have already addressed it in their previous paper, which they
reference several times, however I have not read that one.
Some of the issues I see, which I would have liked to see addressed
1. Who has the authority to activate the emergency switch, and what
mechanisms prevent its abuse?
2. What mechanism is used to activate this emergency switch?
3. Who has access to make use of the mesh network after it has been
activated? The paper seems to imply that it would only be used by
emergency responders, but their methodology is to open it up such that
anyone would be able to connect and access the network.
4. What liability would individuals face if their network was misused by
guests while this emergency switch was activated? Eg, what happens if
someone uses your now-unlocked network to commit a crime such as
illegally transferring copyrighted materials or child pornography?
5. How would the network be utilized in the absence of Internet access?
In the use case the authors describe, the mesh network is being
activiated because of a failure of traditional infrastructure, so it's
reasonable to assume that Internet access would be scare to impossible
in the region.
6. If traditional infrastructure is disrupted, that could include power
lines, how many of the residential routers they identified would still
be online if power was lost?
Could FreedomBox implement something similar to what they describe?
Easily. However I think it would be more interesting and arguably more
valuable for FreedomBox to implement an always-on mesh network rather
than one that is only switched on when emergency responders deem it is
That's my two cents.

To repeat the critique I posted to the Freedombox list:

They seemed to focus at lot on wardriving using and Android app, but
wardriving is sooo last decade. Still, it's good to see validation of
our premise. This story seems to be really picking up, despite the lack
of implementation specifics, which implies that there is interest and
need for what we are building.
That's my two cents.

Hi Ryan,
This is Ben the Pyrate. I'm glad you're interested in Project Byzantium.
Well you reached me, at least. I'm forwarding this on to the Project
Byzantium mailing list to bring everyone else in the loop. There is a
lot of good information in your email which I believe will be of
interest to everyone. You can join our mailing list by signing up at the
following link:
I agree, that sounds like a great place to test and demonstrate a
project like Byzantium. As long as there is the understanding that
Byzantium is still in development and not ready for use in life-or-death
I am not planning on attending, but perhaps other members are? We still
have a number of v0.2a CDs left over and I would be willing to send them
up with someone so they can get into the hands of testers.
Yep, we have heard about this one but so far there is no code, only some
documentation on the protocol. We're not certain wether or not this is
redundant with other solutions we have also been looking at. We are
planning to keep an eye on their developments.
I was not aware of Forban, but it certainly does look like something
that might be useful to us. I will look into it further and perhaps we
can try it out at our development sprint this weekend.
Yes, we're aware of the Serval project and we're also eager to make sure
that our networks can interoperate seamlessly. They are doing a lot of
good work and we are keeping an eye on them as well. We may incorporate
some of their software into future versions of Byzantium.
Thanks, the above projects are all very interesting and definitely
in-line with what we're trying to offer. We will try to evaluate and
intregrate these into future builds.
Bitcoin is quite a fascinating idea in many ways, however I don't think
it is very relevant to Byzantium's core mission. I'm very sure it could
be operated over a mesh network like Byzanitum. However, I don't really
see how Bitcoin would be useful from an emergency response perspective.
I could be wrong and I would be glad to hear opposing arguments. However,
for now I don't think it will be part of the standard distribution. (Of
course, there's nothing stopping you from installing it yourself or
making a re-spin of our distribution.)
We are currently doing our best to reach out to other mesh networking
projects and communities to collaborate on a set of standards and best
practices for interoperability. We are working on a proposal which will
be presenting in early October. Byzantium is somewhat narrowly focused
on one piece of the problem-set, so we are eager to collabroate with
complimentary projects who are solving other pieces (such as Serval and
Commotion Wireless). However, we are currently working in our spare time
on almost no budget so don't expect overnight progress.
Our next release won't happen for several months so the v0.2a release
will still be the most current version in mid-September. We don't have
the resource to make an updated release for S17. Even if we did, there
haven't been any significant changes to warrant it.
Good luck, and please let us know how Byzanitum does "in the field". We
are always eager to see user feedback and bug reports.
Thank you,
Ben the Pyrate

@_subject: [HacDC:Byzantium] Re: Development sprint coming up this weekend. 
Yes, the sprint will be at HacDC in the software/class room. We usually
spread it over two days. Friday night we start around 7p and have some
discussions on specifically what we want to accomplish and how we will
allocate time on Saturday, and then work a little bit or just make sure
everything is setup for Saturday. Also, if we have enough people there by
8p we usually have free pizza.
Then on Saturday we get started at noon and work late with a break or two
in the middle to keep everyone fresh and focused. In the past we have tried
to set the start time at 10am, but some of us have found it difficult to
wake up that early on a Saturday. ;-)
You're welcome to come for either or both days.
