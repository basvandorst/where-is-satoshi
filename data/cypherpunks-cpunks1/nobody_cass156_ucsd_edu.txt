Amazing, absolutely amazing!
Perhaps we should stop reading Chomsky (if we ever did) and read James A.
Donald--he obviously has not only a grasp of what it is people *really*
mean, but also has the spurious arguments to back himself up!
The Chomsky quote of the day:
In this, James A. Donald finds:
What? Non sequitur!  No where in Chomsky's quote do we find any remote
resemblance of a reference to mass media; neither to production,
distribution, nor to supply (nor to economics of any kind).  If I had to
piece this together, Mr. Donald erroneously finds the quote: "The state
should not have the power to stop them" to mean that Mr. Chomsky is
advocating that the "people" *should.*
Mr. Donald continues:
Wrong again.  In his previous writings, James A. Donald *tried to show*
that Chomsky "chooses words so as to convince us that freedom of speech is
not freedom, and that control of speech is freedom."  Unfortunately (or
fortunately, depending on one's personal bias), Mr. Donald's "arguments"
were nothing more than simple speculations which lacked cohesiveness.
He continues:
No, what I *have* noticed is that obviously Chomsky "has carefully expressed
himself in the manner that is least likely to make" James A. Donald feel
favorable to freedom of speech.  I have no problem with the manner in which
Chomsky has expressed himself--then again, I also see that Chomsky's quote
is directed at more than one issue.
Unfortunately, I think that James A. Donald is again missing the point.
Let me help...it is just those "extreme" views which must be protected.
Chomsky does imply that freedom of speech is divisible, but he also implies
that freedom of speech *should not be.*  Furthermore, Chomsky neither
states nor insinuates that "we"--and I assume that James A. Donald is
refering to "the people"--can "suppress wicked, obnoxious, and obviously
false ideas" of any kind!  What he does say is that those persons who form
the power structure of this country--the mainstream intellectuals and the
state--have the power to suppress ideas and speech.  (Remember, Chomsky
says "should not," instead of "does not" in reference to the state's
That's really an amusing twist of logic: 1) I have never heard anyone call
a hypocrite a dissident, and 2) I have never heard Congress being referred
to as a bunch of dissidents!  Because Chomsky refers to faculty senates and
Congress, James A. Donald automatically assumes that Chomsky views them as
dissidents.  A more logical approach would be to hunt for what role both
faculty senates and Congress play in Chomsky's quote--i.e. the role of
hypocrites who *are extended* freedom of speech, as opposed to racists and
other ideological unsavories who "should be permitted" freedom of speech
but are not.  Chomsky does not call these people dissidents, just as he
does not call mainstream intellectuals dissidents; none of these groups,
because they are powerful, privileged, and *mainstream*, may qualify as
dissident.  Furthermore, how in any way, shape or form, can it be safe to
silence dissidents if they are powerful and privileged!
                                                       ^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^^^^^
Apparently, Mr. Donald did not *read* this quote as well.  It would be
quite, quite horrifying to have James A. Donald "dig up a dozen similar
examples."  Quite, quite horrifying.
My question exactly.

First and foremost I would like to publicly apologize to Mr. James A.
Donald... re-reading my intial post to this thread, I feel that I was out
of line in some places.  As is the current topic of the MEME thread, I
would like to stress that one should attack the message and *not* the
messenger.  Mr. Donald (*not* McDonald) is neither a fascist, nor Hitler,
nor anything else than however he chooses to define himself.  His views,
however, *are* open to interpretation.  As it stands, I respect Mr.
Donald's views (and for the most part, I agree with him...on other things
;) ).
The second and last point I would like to make is that quotes to *back up*
an argument are more than helpful, and would save much bandwidth.  If Mr.
Donald would like to continue his part in this thread, either publicly or
privately, I am more than willing to discuss Chomsky (or anything for that
matter), as long as I have something tangible to discuss.  The same applies
to anyone else who wishes to discuss Chomsky....
Like many of us, I get over 500 pieces of email a day--and I try to read
every bit of it; I think one piece of footnoted or otherwise appended email
is worth 20 pieces of the Hitler-calling type.

This just in.  I haven't seen it posted so I thought I would.

IBM-Led Consortium Signs Federal Contract to Develop NII Protocol  Sept. 16
CONTRACTS/VENTURES                                                 HPCwire
A news release from IBM Corporation --
  Somers, N.Y. -- A consortium of organizations led by IBM has been awarded a
contract by the U.S. government to develop open industry software protocols
that will integrate computing environments across the U.S. manufacturing
 The protocols, based on object-oriented technology using Distributed System
Object Model (DSOM) and System Object Model (SOM), will make it easy for
organizations of any size to share the same information so they can work
more cooperatively and efficiently on projects together.
  The Cooperative Agreement that was just signed with the U.S. Department of
Defense (DoD) calls for the development of National Industrial Information
Infrastructure Protocols (NIIIP) as part of the Technology Reinvestment
Project (TRP). NIIIP will allow disparate systems of different manufacturers
to be linked and exchange information real-time so companies can work as a
single, integrated "virtual enterprise" to address a business opportunity.
Much of the NIIIP work will be consolidating and "harmonizing" the many sets
of existing protocols, and then doing pilot projects and demonstration work
to prove the efficacy of the recommended approach.
  The NIIIP protocols are viewed by the DoD's Advanced Research Projects
Agency (ARPA) as one of the fundamental building blocks of the National
Information Infrastructure (NII). Since all U.S.  manufacturing companies
will be able to use the NIIIP protocols, the government expects that American
industry's competitiveness will increase with their use.
  The TRP is designed to link the best of America's defense and commercial
industries. TRP projects are intended to create "dual use" technologies that
have both military and commercial applications. They help defense firms make
the transition to commercial markets, prepare defense engineers and workers
for the manufacturing industries of the future, and help prepare commercial
firms to provide defense products in case of national emergencies.
  The $60 million project is made up of federal matching funds and existing
and incremental development costs, as well as in-kind funds from the
consortium members. The consortium members will invest more than half of the
total project costs.
  In addition to IBM, the other members of the consortium are: STEP Tools,
Inc.; Enterprise Integration Technologies; UES, Inc.; the University of
Florida; Texas Instruments Incorporated; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute;
Digital Equipment Corporation; Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company; MESC
Electronic Systems, Inc.; International TechneGroup Incorporated; Taligent;
CAD Framework Initiative, Inc.; General Dynamics, Electric Boat Division and
the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
  The NIIIP proposal was sponsored by the IBM Manufacturing Industry and also
includes participation by the IBM Microelectronics Division, Software Solutions
Division, and the Networking Software Division. Their products include a broad
array of software, hardware, and integration services to provide concurrent
engineering and computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) that help manufacturers
reduce time to market, improve product quality and lower unit costs, while
meeting environmental and other international standards.
  As overall Program Manager, IBM will manage the system design, development,
and integration, as well as the establishment of commercial channels for
delivery of the project's resultant software products, planned for completion
in 1998. IBM also will be responsible for skills transfer through its CIM in
Higher Education Alliance, a nationwide IBM-sponsored organization consisting
of 97 U.S. colleges, universities and technical institutions.
  Selection of the IBM-led consortium's proposal from among the 2,850
proposals submitted is a significant endorsement of IBM's leadership in the
field of information technology with proven experience in creating open
software products, providing technical software support, and managing a broad
array of distribution channels.
  The DoD announced earlier this year that it had selected this consortium to
develop NIIIP under the TRP, but it held off formally approving the deal
until the Cooperative Agreement was reached.

@_subject: SUFFERANCE remailers 
Hmm.  Unfortunately I think we're missing the point here.  Perhaps a
redefinition of SUFFERANCE REMAILERS...  A SUFFERANCE REMAILER is remailer
which exists only so long as *any* government, organization, person(s) does
not decide (for whatever reasons) to shut it down, outlaw it, etc.
Firstly, a remailer which is not directly vunerable to the U.S.'s "gun
argument" may still be vunerable to any other country's gun argument;
information is power, and no State may be trusted to act in our best
interest insofar as information and communication are concerned.
Secondly, sing the *placement* of a remailer in a recalcitrant country as
the only means of defense against U.S. legislation will pretty much insure
that the remailer's general location will, sooner or later, become a
military target; whereas the remailer's location makes it *indirectly*
vunerable to the U.S.'s "gun argument," the very fact that it is accessible
by U.S. citizens makes it *directly* vunerable to the U.S. military
machine.  (Again, this is using on placement as a means of defense against
any U.S. legislation.)
And this brings up point C...
It would not only be necessary to legislate against remailers, but would be
necessary to legislate against *access* to remailers.  This is what I
imagine would happen.
