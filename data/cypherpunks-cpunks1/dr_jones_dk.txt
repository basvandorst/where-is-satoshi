Is that stream of emails public accessible somewhere?  If not, why?
It is packaged for Debian, available in untable (Sid) and testing  Being rather new, also as upstream code, it certainly could use some  actual crash-testing, though:  Please anyone interesting in shipping this in future FreedomBoxen strongly consider installing the Debian package yourself on your own machines, play with it, and file bugreports about any and all issues you run across with it.
I find it odd having you (or anyone - not personal) proxy in the first    - Jonas

Yes, let's build FreedomBox 1.0 before we build FreedomBox 2.0.
In my mind, FreedomBox 1.0 is *boring* - it contains no new inventions, only oldfashioned Debian mechanisms served user-friendly boxed.  That in itself is a *big* milestone for FreedomBox.
FreedomBox 2.0 is *interesting* - it contains improved ways of doing stuff classic among geeks, and still does it user-friendly boxed.
FreedomBox 3.0 is *exciting* - it contains new inventions that have happened in parallel to our "boring" work, inspired by similar events that triggered the FreedomBox project but without that tough contraint of being user-friendly.  Of course when those inventions reach FreedomBox they _are_ provided user-friendly boxed - because that is a fundamental requirement of FreedomBox.
We (as in the developers on FreedomBox) HAVE to integrate everything needed for serving privacy-aware functionality in a user-friendly way. If we don't, we don't have a FreedomBox, but some other Debian-related tool or toy.
True that the web is about tying many systems together.
FreedomBox, however, is about protecting privacy, and here it does matter crucially to have enough functionality locally so as to not leak privacy when doing said hyperlinking.
FreedomBox is also about serving non-geeks, and here it is crucial that all interaction is user-friendly.  *ALL* interaction!  There is *no* admin, beyond the user herself/himself!
If you mean postponing user-friendliness till later, then it sounds to me like you are talking about something (quite exciting and worthwhile to try reach but) different from Freedombox.
