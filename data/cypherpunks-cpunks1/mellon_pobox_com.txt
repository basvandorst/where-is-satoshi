I usually convert a Google Groups URL to a query using only the Then the URL won't be _too_ long, and if Google changes the URL scheme or is replaced by some other archve, you've got the original Message-ID, the best identifier you could hope for.

He was just trolling, being intentionally vague so that they'd assume
he was copying from one DVD to another. Which they did, and which they raved about.
There isn't any profound insight to be derived from a tired old picture
of a newsgroup being provoked by trolling.

You can't combat an all-powerful government, because it's all-powerful. And you can't manage anonimity against an all-seeing government, because
it is all-seeing.

All or nearly all of them are duplicates of same documents
elsewhere in the directory tree; "X/text/" and "X/iraq/" are
supposed to be copies of "X/", with images removed in the first case. I suspect that downloading them all would just confirm that.

alt.anonymous.messages has a healthy amount of traffic. Google Groups
says they have a bit more than 200 messages in it on December 9, for
example. I assume nearly all of it is from remailers posting to Usenet
(or remailers sending mail to mail2news gateways), otherwise there's
little point of using it.

Oh, that's true of course; but the adversary would be able to know
that you posted something (given that he's monitoring your traffic). That's already something, and frequently more than you'd want to
give away. I did inspect a few random messages and they all came from remailers.

No, it's silly because he said "becoming". Had he said "is", it would've been criminally stupid.
For example, the US has a long, long, long, long way to go before becoming anything remotely like North Korea, in terms of totalitarianism. Of course, North Korea is a radical example; there are
many countries much more totalitarian than the US and extremely likely
to remain so in any foreseeable future. All the Patriot Acts and increased surveillance and whatever else has been happening in the US
lately is a drop in the ocean of difference between the US and those other countries, in that respect.

Gee, I'd be real happy I wasn't shot on the spot, or maybe cruelly tortured and then shot, the way I'd behaved to people I'd captured.
Or maybe torn into pieces by a shrieking mob.
Instead of doing any of that, they check my teeth and give me a haircut
in front of the cameras? Boo fucking hoo. I'd be real happy about millions of bleeding hearts all over the world jerking their knees in unison, ready to cry a fucking ocean over this unbelievably cruel haircut and medical check-up I'm being given. Fucking tools.

I thought it was trivial all along.
Oh please. They (well, many of them) sure didn't forget their dislike of the US when they saw those newsreels of the twin towers tumbling down. Actually, they mostly systematically manipulated and fucked themselves over, with occassional help from different factions in the rest of the world. And they already have a "symbol of how we've", etc. - American military presence in the most holy of Islamic countries, Saudi Arabia. That's one of the largest reasons for Al-Qaeda growth in recent years. Compared to infidel military bases somewhere near Mecca and Medina, whatever's done to some dictator who has presided over a mostly secular regime is insignificant. And American military presence in Saudi Arabia is actually subsiding now because Iraq is no longer a threat. This is just so much armchair psychology. Most of it is silly theoretising that has no grounding in reality.
One side says: look, we had to humuliate him publicly, because those Arabs only understand power, they only respect you if you clearly show them who's the boss, bla bla bla.
The other side says: we shouldn't humiliate him, because the Arab culture is built around the all-powerful concept of pride, and they'll never forget how we hurt their pride, bla bla bla.
Both sides are spewing idiotic garbage with some marginal relevance to reality, which is much, much more complicated than that. You can't predict what "the crowd" will say, and the Arab "crowd" is no more symplistic than the American one. It does "work" somewhat differently, and does display different "mentality", whatever that means, but none of it is exploitable with any useful degree of certainty by cheap armchair This is inane.
Truth is always relevant.

Of course it matters.
This is a principle of civilian life, not military conflicts. There's no "innocent until proven guilty" in military conflicts, surely you understand that.
Oh, and BTW, do you know that in the enlightened western society (give up the sarcastic quotes shtick, it's died and its corpse stinks pretty badly) judges commonly allow or deny bail, or set its amount, based on
hypothesised accusations against a detained person, when nothing at all has been proven, in the court of law or otherwise? Why don't you go and fight that grievious injustice?

Right. We don't know that he's a murdering son of a bitch, that's all propaganda, but we DO know that we've supported him in the past and IT'S ALL OUR FAULT. That is no propaganda, surely. There's never any need to qualify *those* kinds of assertons with the "propaganda mills" line.

[taken from private exchange back to the list with mutual agreement]
But Saddam's regime itself stemmed from illegal takeover of a previous regime -- doesn't that make all of his regime illegitimate and his authority void?
The only reason Saddam has a plausible claim to authority is because he has taken gotten it by force. By the same reasoning, US or US-installed regime, which is being put into power by the use of force, has a plausible claim to authority as well.
Why not?
