@_subject: Is Rush Limbaugh giving Clinton sh*t about wiretap chip? 
I'm under the impression that Rush Limbaugh's address is:
70277.2502 at compuserve.com
Would a few articulate defenders of (privacy and) AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS
send him some convincing words, please?
G. Gordon Liddy would be another good target, but I don't know his address.
