Another crosspollination from PUBLIC_KEYS. Just something to think
It refers to Keith Henson's article I ran in FidoNews (apparently the
file was corrupted, but that's another story.)
This is in no way to imply that the story is bad, nor that I didn't
like it (I did), nor that this is even a common opinion. I actually
received a few thanks for running it. It's just something to consider.
And implies that Keith's article/story is doing it's job!
A message from Tom Jennings to all was released into the bitstream 20 Oct 92   TJ> re: PUBLIC RELATIONS, hell, substance too --
 TJ> If what we're doing here is ensuring PRIVACY, let's call it PRIVACY.
 TJ> Calling it encryption simply drops us into the same category as

Speaking of which, the story by Keith Henson in this week's FidoNews
probably set us back ten years.  Now data encryption's indelibly
linked with saboteurs, criminals and terrorists. :-( Well, maybe not _everyone_ reads FidoNews... :-)

I agree 101% -- I'd rather have a "bad" system in place, with people
asking for a good one (and roundly complaining about the short-sighted
implementors :-) than to sit and wait until we can implement the
"right" system.
I'd much rather have email users want privacy and rag about their
compromised system. Even a relatively poor one buts some substantial
blocks into routine bulk monitoring of traffic...
As frequently happens, the real problem is not technical.

 U>    I think I have a rough description of the hardware  U> serial random generator I want to build.    I want to call  U> it the "Rander box" for lack of a better name. Using serial ports is probably not a good idea on PC clones. The IBM
hardware design limits a machine to two ports comfortably, four
practical maximum. Any machine that uses telecomm. (BBSs, etc) will
have to consume the serial hardware, and will interfere with whatever
you have to do.
A good choice would be a parallel port, ie. a printer port. The IBM
design allows 4 or more easily, and rarely do you see a pclone with
more than two printers attached. If there isn't a spare port
available, Fry's sells printer adapters for $19.95. Late-model printer
adapters are 8 bit in and out, and are capable of Ethernet speeds.
The parallel port uses standard busy/done and TTL levels.
(For a "universal" serial version, you could internally have the 8 bit
busy/done interface drive a UART. I bet simply fixing the data rate
to 9600 baud would work.)
 U>    When switched on,   and a "cr" (or some other  U> character) is sent to it, random bytes will stream out  U> continiously.   Another "cr" will stop the byte stream.     U> At least this is ONE approach.   If anyone can think of a  U> better way,  Pse speak up. I was about to say "prolly not necessary", but others make valid
points... XON/XOFF, DTR, etc are all workable... DTR is compat
w/serial and parallel too.
On a pclone, producing bits continuously is easier. When not in use,
the driver will dump bits onto the floor. Fancy (software) drivers
could spool the bits into a nice big pile ("every bit is sacred...").
A simple driver could simply have say 10,000 bits, and continuously
overwrite the oldest (wrap around the buffer...)

We *are* using PGP, which seems to be good software. Any "mediocrity"
or inherent flaws I was referring to were in key systems, and
suchlike. The social environment in FidoNet is completely different
from here. There will never be any directed training or committees to
define what a "proper" way to handle keys is, and even if there was,
the newbie sysop coming online in East Overshoe Alaska wouldn't even
hear about it, and would install what s/he finds available on the net.
All of our social/technical systems assume this chaotic environment.
It makes for some ahem interesting problems, but the robustness and
growth and innovation are pretty hot.

U> From: 74076.1041 at CompuServe.COM (Hal)
re: why remailers aren't as exciting as RNG's.
Well, remailers are working, admittedly a bit clunky at the moment,
and RNGs being talked about aren't. And we're primarily hackers. Once
something's working, it's less interesting, no? :-)
The next step for remailers is to make them actually *usable*,
routinely. Their current status is no fault of the implementors, it's
a first pass and a test bed (I ain't complaining!)
I just don't think it's a big secret, nor a big problem. Development
is always slow and boring... :-)

@_subject: ECPA - PRIVACY 
Crossposted from FidoNet PUBLIC_KEYS
from: GK Pace
  I just finished reading your article concerning the "laymans view"
of the ECPA.  I found it very informative, and interesting reading.
Thank you for taking the time to study this issue, and share with the
rest of us the conclusions you arrived at, upon doing so.
  I would like to comment upon some of what you've written, in hopes
of expanding upon what you have conveyed, and have quoted your article
so that those who haven't read your article will find it easier to
understand the nature of my comments.
 ========== Begin Quote ==========
 Anytime someone passes what they hope to be a private communication to
another, they expect that their fellow citizens will respect its privacy.
Not only do the customs of society enforce this expectation, statute laws
have been enacted to insure it.  Thus, everyone knows, or should know, not
to tamper with the mail.  Everyone knows, or should know, not to
electronically eavesdrop ("bug") someone else's telephone calls.  And
everyone knows, or should know, not to do likewise with computer
Alas, not everyone knows that.  If everyone did, we wouldn't need laws to
protect what ought to be our reasonable expectations of privacy.  Not too
long ago, the Congress of the United States passed PL 99-508, the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act of 1986.  In doing so, Congress was recognizing
the way technology has changed society and trying to react to that change.
 ========== End Quote ==========
  This statement kinda sums up what the discussion is all about... and
ties this subject into the provisions of the ECPA. seems like a
fitting beginning for the remainder of what I'd like to discuss.
 ========== Begin Quote ==========
What about electronic mail, or "e-mail?"  E-Mail has been the single biggest
area of misinformation about the new law.  First, section 2701 does make it
a federal offense to read someone else's electronic mail.  That would be
exceeding your authorization, since "private" e-mail systems do not intend
for anyone other than the sender or receiver to see that mail.  But, and a
big but, sysops are excluded.
 ========== End Quote ==========
  This statement in and of itself lends credibility to the position
that we have the right to read any messages passing thru our system...
however as you continue to mention, this exclusion is not without
conditions, and it isn't necessarily a "right" but is perhaps more
accurately defined as an acknowledgement of the technical aspects of
our respective systems, and the part we play in accomodating the
transfer of E-mail...
 ========== Begin Quote ==========
 Whoever staffed the bill for Congress realized that system operators were going to have access to information stored on their systems.
 ========== End Quote ==========
  You also of course mention reasons for which this ability might be
 ========== Begin Quote ==========
 There are practical technical reasons for this, but there are also practical legal reasons.  While the Act does not directly address the liability of
sysops for the use of their systems in illegal acts, it recognizes they might have some liability, and so allows them to protect themselves from illegal use.
 ========== End Quote ==========
  This statement reeks of common sense... but is there anything in the
ECPA which would indicate a "responsibility" on the part of the Sysop
to actively monitor such communications, requiring the Sysop to assume
the position of censor, police, and/or judge, over the content of
those messages passing thru ones system - or does it again acknowledge
the techical aspects, and responsibilities the Sysop might be required
to exercise in the event the Sysop were to become aware of a message
containing potentially illegal information?  ========== Begin Quote ==========
  Sysops are given a special responsibility to go along with this special privilege.  Just like a letter carrier can't give your mail to someone else, just like a telegraph operator can't pass your telegram to someone else, just like a telephone operator overhearing your call can't tell someone else what
it was about, so sysops are prohibited from disclosing your e-mail traffic to anyone, unless you (or the other party to the traffic) give them permission.
 ========== End Quote ==========
  This analysis is again just plain common sense, and again the
question arises, are the provisions this refers to those which are
acknowledged as technical limitations, accomodating them as such, or
are they to be construed as indications that we have obligations above
and beyond that which is necessary for the performance of the service
we are providing?
 ========== Begin Quote ==========
What all this has said is that the federal criminal code now protects
electronic communications the way it previously protected written ones.  It
understands that mailmen, physical or electronic, have access to the mail
they carry, so it tells them not to tell.
 ========== End Quote ==========
  This statement seems clear enough... but when viewed from the aspect
of the issue of wheather "private" E-mail should be allowed in
Fidonet, it gives rise to some questions which can possibly be best
conveyed by following the analog you have chosen... i/e that of a
mailman, and that of "paper mail".
  The issue of the Sysop having the ability to read e-mail, as
compared to the provisions of the ECPA appear to be more closely
comparable to "postcards" being carried by a mailman.  In this case,
no one could deny that the mailman has a "technical" ability to read
the postcards being carried, and that the requirements on the part of
the mailman not to divulge such information he/she might happen to
notice is clear... as are the responsibilities that would be evident
were he/she to become aware of information which could resonably be
contrued as illegal in nature.  But as in the example of the mailman
handling paper mail, there exists the ability to send "private" paper
mail, which is enclosed in an envelope.  In such cases is is not
within the rights of the mailman to open such mail to enable his
ability to determine the contents thereof, nor is there any legal
responsibility for the mailman to have knowledge of the contents
thereof.  Indeed it would be a criminal act were the mailman to do so.
  With the above in mind, wouldn't the introduction of private e-mail
capabilities in Fidonet be governed by the same logic?  And isn't
public key encryption simply the means of wrapping an envelope around
e-mail to make it private?

This is the PUBLIC_KEYS Echo. The purpose of the Echo is to provide a place to post and find public-keys for data encryption within FidoNet and elsewhere and to discuss data and software encryption and the various schemes thereof.
 This is a technical Echo with very few rules. Those very few rules are:
1. Stay on-topic. Topics of keys and encryption are welcome. Others are not.
 2. No politics [except as it relates to privacy issues] and no religion.
 3. No personal attacks, slurs or innuendo. Stick to issues not
  personalities.
 4. No Private flagged messages in Echomail! Encrypted traffic using
  public-keys is permitted for the exercise so long as it is on-topic.
 5. This Echo may be traveling around the world so try to be concise. Avoid
  excessive quoting for one-liner responses.
 6. Be aware that Echomail is NOT secure. Don't take anything at face value.
 7. The posts in this Echo are the sole responsiblity of the poster. If you
  need verification, use Netmail.
 8. The Moderators will deal with off-topic traffic. Don't respond for them.
  Links to this Echo will only be curtailed when absolutely necessary so
  please don't make it necessary. [grin]
The Moderators are Christopher Baker [KeyID: 1024/4B9A59 1992/10/03] and GK Pace [KeyID: 1024/B6B823 1992/09/28] at 1:374/14 and 1:374/26, respectively.
 It is recommended that public-keys be made available via Netmail or by file-request with the magic filename: PGPKEY and that the public-key provided for that request by given a distinctive filename using part or all of each provider's name and address. For example, on my system, a file-request of PGPKEY will give BAK37414.ASC to the requesting system. This will avoid duplicate overwriting and make it easier to track the keys. Using a standard magic filename will make it easier to find keys on different systems.
 This Echo is not currently on the Zone 1 Backbone distribution list but that is expected to change as soon as the word gets out. This Echo will be EListed in ELIST211 next month. Please feel free to announce and distribute this Echo to all interested participants in your area.
 Thanks.
 TTFN.  Christopher Baker & GK Pace Moderators
any questions? anyone with Areafix already set for this system or for 1:374/26 may link in remotely. all others need to send a Netmail request. the Echo will be distributed privately until it is large enough for moving to the Zone 1 Backbone [or any other Backbones who want to get into it].
 thanks.

> To: Tom Jennings
I am considering becoming and "introducer" for parts of FidoNet. I
can't seem to get past the problems of how to assign reliability to
public keys I receive over an unsecured email channel to begin with.
No other method is practical.
Huh?  I don't understand what you're pointing out.  If I send you my
public key -- even if I cc: dockmaster -- what does it matter that the
NSA knows my public key (unoless they want to send me msgs, too)? Not my worry. What I meant was, how do I know htat the keyfile I
received from "John Smith @ net address" really is his, and not some
faker. Short of physically getting key disks from someone face to
face (flatly im-possible here), I don't know.
The assurance of course is the social system: if someone sends me a
message and keyfile, "here's my file, my name is Eric Hughes", and I
distribute it...
I can think of no way to prevent this, other than let a social system
detect and repair -- "HEY THATS NOT ME!!!" form the 'real' you would
raise a flag... and an audit trail at the introducers site
(dangerous...!) might help.
Anyhoo, that's what I meant.

I guess I had to come at this from the backside. You are right.
Accepting keys over the network will provide reasonably well-sealed

Thank you for clarifying my particular problem: what I was worried
about was *authentication* not security. I had the two tangled up.
Duh. With an informal email/introducer setup for the FidoNet, we'll have a
fairly secure system with a reasonable level of authentification,
practically speaking, with authentification to some high level doable
on an individual basis. (Using PGP.)
This probably as "good as it gets" in our (email) environment.

I just completed (well, it's in "beta") a mail-reader package for
MSDOS and FidoNet. It does "rm" type stuff, and has PGP integrated
reawonably well. Single character commands to decrypt, encrypt, sign,
or encrypt/sign. It furnishes the distributed PGP.EXE program with
it's imput (deriving it from the message itself). It'll extract keys
from messages, and all that.
It's MSDOS and .MSG-type FidoNet message base oriented, but it does
all it's work in pure ASCII (FidoNet .MSG files are mixed binary and
text). It is intentionally "RFC-822 like", and will become fully
RFC-822 "soon".
I was reasonably careful regarding de-cyphered plaintext laying about
on disk, etc. It's available via Wazoo filerequest as magicname RM.
(That's probably as obscure to you as FTP is to FidoNet.)
It will be released as "copyleft" with all sources. Binaries only

There's a conference in FidoNet called PUBLIC_KEYS, devoted to PGP
and surrounding issues. Most evreyone is enthusiastic but without
security experience. As always, we find that the prevailing "right
ways to do things" don't fit.
FidoNet's main need is "privacy", not "Security". What would be
considered very low "security" in traditional circles would be more
than adequate. (And of course the usual ways work just fine with a for
"real" security needs.)
Follows is an article I ran in FidoNews, the weekly FidoNet
newsletter. I hoep it makes sense. The FidoNet environment is a
little different than other nets.
* Security and authentication using PGP in FidoNet
THOUGHTS ON SECURITY AND AUTHENTICATION
FOR EMAIL SYSTEMS
Tom Jennings (1:125/111)
Some ideas on public key security systems. To sum up ahead of time, I
assert that the public broadcasting of public keys is more than
enough security and authentication for casual, privacy needs in the
FidoNet or other email network.
All of this article assumes the use of PGP version 2.0, the RSA
double-key encryption system implemented as freeware.
This is all new to most of us, this security/privacy thing. Both
technologically and socially. What privacy we have we take for granted
without much thought; letters in envelopes, "who is it?" to knocks on
the door, etc. When we try to break down these things into their
underlying assumptions, well, it's hard. We shouldn't get upset with
ourselves or others if "we don't get it" right away. And we'll find
some obvious things aren't, and vice versa.
I will assume that if you really, really need utter absolute security,
you can achieve that with PGP or whatever. If it's that sensitive,
sending it over an electronic medium probably isn't recommended. This
article isn't about how to achieve bank-vault security.
Within the FidoNet, the most common use we all seem to talk about is
PRIVACY, rather than SECURITY. I can only speak for myself, but, my
netmail (not echomail) traffic is probably a reasonable example.  I
read about 100 messages a week, and send out about 50. There's a dozen
or so people I talk with regularly, and about 50 per week that I do
not know. Most of it is of the "Oh yeah, so and so said this. How's
your mother. Did you get that file OK...". Even if an eavesdropper
read this stuff, I would barely care. There are some times though when revealed message contents could be...
personally compromising. Embarrassing. A real life example: a long
time ago, a sysop in a net was having trouble with their net host.
Some messages critical of that net host were intercepted by the host,
some passed on, and some we each got replies to! Not Good. What *I* want is a way to ensure that sometimes, only the addressee
can read a given message. I am willing to pay some penalty for this,
but I won't live with a system that restrains me like a stone castle
and moat. My needs and risks just aren't that great.
With that as a background assumption, let's look at two separate
issues that look at first to be the same -- SECURITY and
SECURITY -- given an encrypted message, how likely is it that someone
can ascertain what's inside it (assuming you're not the addressor or
addressee)?  As an operating assumption, I will take it for granted
that PGP produces files that are secure in themselves (barring bugs,
etc). Like the docs say, a frontal cryptological assault is hard, and
in our casual privacy case, probably not what we've got to worry
There are other ways to figure out what's going on. Imagine you're
that net host. You've had trouble with this particular sysop before.
You notice he's just sent a flurry of messages to the local RC, then
the ZC. Hmmm!! Do you really need to know what's in those messages?!
(This is called traffic analysis. In pre-WWII Germany, the Nazis
tracked down "Jew sympathizers" with traffic analysis of telephone
billing information; Europeans don't get itemized phone bills any
longer... like here in the US. So I was told, the information is no
longer kept. (Do I really believe that...:-))
Anyways, security is more than cryptographic strength. Turns out,
there's a way around this: anonymous remailers. In a private Internet
mailing list Eric Hughes came up with a trick to anonymously remail
messages; you send mail destined for system X to the remailer instead;
it strips off the header info and mails it to system X.  Anonymity
isn't really needed though in the case above, simple remailing will
do. Again, our *general* FidoNet needs are modest.
AUTHENTICATION is the sticky one for us. Authentication is
determining: is this person really the person they say they are? But I
think you'll see it isn't the fatal problem it appears to be at first.
Let's get the obvious case out of the way first again: if you need
utter and absolute security, you better damn well know the person
ahead of time, you should get a key delivered by hand, and you should
think about if you really want to conduct business over an electronic
link in the first place. Authentication in this case isn't -- or
shouldn't be! -- a problem.
For our relatively-casual privacy use, authentication is almost moot.
Some people I have already exchanged keys with, *I've never met face
to face in my life* and may never. In spite of this I feel I know
them. I trust or assume that they are who they say they are. This is
the environment we need to work in.
This, plus the fact that we've got (at the moment) some 16,000
potential keys, means we simply can't do the full-blast security
thing. How much "security" can I expect, or need, with someone I've
never met? Consider again the utter-security case again.
But the bottom line is in fact already taken care of, PGP or not --
how do you know that "the real Tom Jennings" wrote this article? Our
underlying social system, so frequently overlooked, takes care of it.
You can assume I, and many people who have been in the net, are
verifiable. You have a number of ways to determine if I really wrote
this article. Simply asking via FidoNet will uncover most fakes.
Looking at old nodelists to see what info on my name has changed. Ask
people who might know me. And so on. If our public keys are scattered to the wind like plants scatter
pollen, it is certainly possible that I could fake "your" public key,
and gain access through all the methods discussed in detail in the
literature.  However, assuming the real person and the fake person(s)
are both generating keys (and using them to sign and send messages),
the more keyrings were passed around the chances of detecting the
incompatible keys becomes almost certain. At that point, even a casual
effort would be able to track it down, to at least determine that
there *was* a fake.
Example: Mary has been using PGP for a few months, and conversing with
friends and acquaintances. Her public key is filerequestable, and
probably appears on a hundred keyrings. Over the next few months, other people get messages from "Mary" making
increasingly odd claims, via encrypted mail. The impostors fake key,
in order to be useful at all, would also have to be widely
Curious, someone sends Mary a message encrypted with what appears to
be her public key, and a plaintext one telling her that the
cyphertext was encrypted with her public key, and that he suggests if
she can't decipher it someone may have faked her key.
What Mary actually does depends on many things. If she has indeed
been creating the crazy messages, well, the problem's elsewhere. If
she finds she can't read the message, her recourse depends on what is
available to her: if there are public key repositories, she would be
advised to contact them and notify them of the alleged faked key(s),
and follow whatever process is setup to generate a new key.
The very knowledge of key collision would be enough to flag to users
that there's a potential problem.
There are more practical issues that limit our need for traditional
security measures on keys.
Even if you stored your private key on disk, it would take physical
access of your machine to get it. This is not what I'm worried about
in private FidoNet mail. If a FidoNet member tries to break into my
house or system to get at my key, I've got other troubles! Practically speaking, it might even be a good idea to have two keys; a
small (256 bit) one for casual, email privacy, and a big one (1024
bits) that you give to people by hand on diskette. The small key will
mean better performance, more important on bulk casual email, and
certainly adequate against eavesdropping. For high-security needs,
which most people don't have (I certainly  don't), the performance
penalty probably won't matter as much.
The worst part of security systems is that people will *rely* on them
as absolutes. This is the only thing that makes a faked, encrypted
message worse than a faked, plaintext message.
Again, it's important to remember the goal (as if we could ever
possibly agree to a *single* goal...) -- if it's privacy, the ability
to stop eavesdroppers, then a broadcast public key system is more than
adequate, and public key repositories even better. If you want a
maximum-security vault, you take added precautions. No one system will
solve all problems. I'm a firm believer in a broadcast public key
system for email.
PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR PGP USE IN FIDONET PRIVACY:
 * Use small (256 bit) keys for routine, low-security use, such as
netmail privacy with people you don't know personally (and don't get
keys from physically).
 * Public key encryption is most useful for email, ie. FidoNet
netmail, especially when it flows through multiple hosts on its way
to its destination.
 * The current password scheme for echomail links is proven to be
adequate to safeguard what is basically a public forum, anyways.
Further security doesn't seem to be needed on these links.
 * When adding keys received via FidoNet to your public keyring,
answer "do you want to certify this key yourself" with NO, unless you
received the key by hand. It doesn't hurt the usefulness of the key
itself; however, if someone later uses your public keyring they won't
be lulled into a false security. (Certification of keys can be done
at any time.)
 * Passing keyrings around willy-nilly, though counter to "good
security practice" in traditional uses is actually a good thing for
us. "Key Repositories" scattered throughout the net (each exchanging
keyrings as well as posting lists of "trouble keys") is a better idea.
 * Reserve large (1024 bit) keys for people who you know, and can
ensure security in traditional ways (some pointed out in the PGP
documentation). * As seems to be developing, have your public key filerequestable as
magicname "PGPKEY" (your own public key only), and your keyring as
"KEYRING" (all of your public keys). These should be ASCII-armor
files (PGP -kxa)

                  Public Keys Depository Proposal
                        By Marcos R. Della
               (1:125/180 or marcos at zippy.sonoma.edu)
Def:  De.pos.i.to.ry (di-POZ-i-tohr-ee) n. a storehouse, a place for
safekeeping of things
With the latest release of the PGP20 program, public key availability
has fallen into the hands of the individual.  This provides a relative
degree of security over messages that are sent from user to user in
various formats (text, binary, etc) over different transportation
mechanisms.  I will not go into the system that allows public keys to
work nor public key history.  Instead I'll point you to the rather
complete documentation that comes with the PGP program.
Unfortunately, there is a major drawback to this system (also pointed
out in the PGP documentation).  Public key distribution has few
security elements involved to insure the validity of a particular key.
PGP attempts to address this problem by providing a "signature" system
to each public key to give reasonable validity to its origin.
Unfortunately, this depends upon trust of the individual who signs the
key to begin with.  Who polices the policemen?
Unfortunatly, the issue of key validity is yet another topic that
cannot be easily addressed since authenticity lies in one persons
trust of another.  Yet there still needs to be a system in which keys
can be distributed or held for later use.  This system should be
multiply redundant and have some degree of immediate access in order
to make the information stored useful.  One such system would be a
depository, a place to store public keys for later retrieval.
This proposal will attempt to describe a system whereby you can get
around the validation of public keys problem without requiring someone
to police the Depository itself!
Problems Involved:
 - How do you know the key depositor isn't faking his/her keys?
 - How do you verify (at the depository) that a key being deposited is
   from the key originator or is even valid?
 - What is to prevent the depository from faking keys that is "signs"?
 - How can this system be resonably redundant and easy to access?
First off, the depository is NOT a validation center.  The system
never will verify the users as existing or if they are even honest
users.  The depository key signature only verifies that the key has
been deposited and is available for access at any time.  Again, the
depository DOES NOT verify users, only the fact that a deposit has
been made.  (A better form of deposit slip)
If a user wants to deposit his/her key, what is to prevent the sysop
from intercepting this public key, making a substitution replacement,
and then forwarding the new public key?  Unfortunately, there are
sysops out there that have already done this in some respects.
Thereby the system has to place the responsibility upon the user for
key deposit verification.  To prevent the sysop from changing the
deposit, the user should use the Depository Public Key (hereafter
referred to as DepoKey) to send his/her key for deposit.
Again, what prevents the "bad" sysop from just throwing this message
away (obviously he can't read it) and sending a fake message (also
encrypted with the DepoKey)?  Although this eventually thwarts the
entire system (the sysop cannot fake the users public key unless the
user uploads it in plain text to the sysop), it still causes problems.
To prevent this, the user should include some sort of text in the
deposit that the depository will mail back to the user, ENCRYPTED
along with the user's public key.  When the user receives a valid
message back that contains his original text, things are fine.  If the
user does not receive a response in a few days or gets an incorrect
return message, then the user should send a cancel message to the
depository and re-deposit his or her key.  The complete the handshake,
the user should send an authentication back to the depository stating
that the key was recieved correctly (instructions on how to do this
should be returned with the key). If a return reciept isn't back in a
resonable period of time, the depository will remove the key from its
deposit keyring.  NOTE:  This will never invalidate a public key, it
will only prevent it from being distributed via the depository system.
What is to prevent the depository from faking keys that it "signs"?
Well, in order to be effective with fake keys, you need to be in the
transport path of the messages that you are planning on "stealing".
Since the depository is not a major hub or node (except possibly to a
few people) this negates any effect of faking keys.  Also, once a user
has received verification that the depository has his public key, he can
then also post it anywhere.  The depository will return his public key
with a depository signature on it.  This allows the user to upload a
verified key to anywhere.  When keys are distributed with a depository
signature on them, then they are on file with the depository in case
someone wants to withdraw them later.
As long as the public key for the depository is made worldwide public,
this system will work.
As for creating a multiply redundant system, there should be several
sites that are listed as depositories.  These systems will on a weekly
basis, exchange acknowledged keys (ie, keys that have undergone the
handshaking process) with one another.  A user can then request a key
from ANY of the depository sites and get the same information.
For those that want certified keys (other than from the users) such as a
BBS system needing the public key of another, there will be a withdrawal
mechanism built into the depository to pull single or multiple keys.
Also, the complete public keyring may optionally be pulled (FREQing).
The actual mechanism:
Below is the Depository Public Key.  Any public key that has been signed
with this depository key will be assumed to have undergone the handshake
process to verify that the originator of the key pair has in fact issued
a valid key.  This signature only verifies the deposit (a reciept).
*** THIS KEY DOES NOT VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF THE USER!!!  ONLY THAT ***
***      THE USER WAS IN FACT THE ORIGINATOR OF THE PUBLIC KEY      ***
***      AND HAS DEPOSITED IT INTO THE PUBLIC KEY DEPOSITORY!!!     ***
For user identification, there should be a second or third signature
from a BBS or known friend.  This will give the key a verification
level.  If the user wishes to deposit a key with another person's
signature, there will be no problem since the handshake method still
insures the source and destination of the message.  (Note:  This is
preferred since depository keys will then be distributed with dual
The depository allow four functions:  Deposit, Withdrawal, Cancel, and
Acknowledgement of Deposit.  To use these function...
DEPOSIT:  Address a message to "Depository" at one of the listed
depositories at the end of this document.  The subject will be "Deposit"
and the text body will contain your Public Key (in Ascii format) and
some small body of text that will be reflected back to you.  NOTE:  The small
body of text and your public key should be encoded WITH the Depository Key.
WITHDRAWAL:  Address a message to "Depository".  The subject will be
"Withdrawal" and the text body will contain what you are looking for on
each line just as if you were polling your own PGP program.  You will be
sent back a list of keys with the depository signature verifying the
message.  Note that a * for the body text will give a LONG list back to
you...  For fidonet, this MIGHT require a poll to recieve your return list.
See Appendix A
CANCEL:  Address a message to "Depository".  The subject will be
"Cancel" and the text body will contain the text "CANCEL PUBLIC KEY"
with your signature on the message.  The cancel will not take place
without your signature!  You will receive a cleartext response to this.
All this does is to remove your public key from the depository keyring.  If
this comes with a "kill" signature for the key, then it will be moved from
the deposit keyring to the invalid/killed keyring.
ACKNOWLEDGE:  Address a message to "Depository".  The subject will be
"Acknowledge" and the text body will contain the text "ACKNOWLEDGE" with
your signature on the message.  Without the signature, your public key
will continue the daily countdown to keyring removal.  A cleartext message
will be returned upon any receipt of this message.
Anything that doesn't fit one of these will be rejected and a return
message will be bounced back.

One: Mostly, in my world, I don't need SECURITY, I need PRIVACY. A
paper envelope sealed with water-soluble glue is just fine. It stops
casual snoops, like the lock on your car door does. None of which will
stop a determined thief, but like Eric says, it's economics -- this
level of security is inexpensive as hell.
Two: it gets people introduced to the very basic concept that there
*is* privacy (security) available, and possible. In the FidoNet, and
the BBS world, this is important.
Three: In FidoNet, we've got 16,000 sysops, doubling every 18 months,
worldwide. Traditional key systems are not only wildly impractical,
they're unnecessary for traditional reasons -- who much security to I
need to talk to someone 5,000 miles away I've never met?
Four: If I need *real* security, I will (or better!) obtain keys in
"traditional", secure ways. I can plug these keys into my casual
privacy system, which will hopefully encompass the technological
mechanisms of en/decryption, signing, plaintext handling, and all the
assorted baggage we'll have to drag around anyways.
Five: it will entrench some disasters; bum, or faked keys, humongous
duplicates, inexperienced people forgetting their secret pass phrases
so they can't even issue key-removal certificates (this has happened
already; its a MAJOR pain in the ass), one "person" with a zillion
IDs, inconsistent IDing, etc etc etc etc etc.
Oh well. In fact, no system gets implemented right. Period. To pretend it will
is folly. Because of the nature of the beast (patents, feds looking
for backdoors, stupidity, centralist, authoritarian types trying to
exert control, etc, I'm pushing, hard and fast, to get systems set up
LIKE CRAZY of all sorts, with all of them being completely distributed
and decentralized. Sufficiently Paranoid.

Actually this sounds signifigantly different from what Denning is
allegedly proposing.
This method is analogous to the way FFL (Federal Firearm License)
holders record transactions of gun sales (I have an FFL). FFL holders
are required to record, in detail, each transaction based upon gun
serial number/description, and to/from addresses (buy/sell). The FFL
holder maintains the records; the feds dont' get a copy.
If a gun is used in a crime, the feds go to the manufacturer, and
follow the audit trail of FFL records to follow that guns travels.
This is *completely* different than a centralized gun database, where
a hypothetical they can compile cross indices based upon oh say name
or address or whatever. The third party escrow method puts the same sort of restraint upon
searches. I'm not saying I particulary like the method, it's just that
it's qualitatively different. The BATF cannot rummage through the
audit trail of FFL records, they can only follow the forward/backward
pointers per gun. Rivest seems to imply there could be many,
independent key-escrow locations. A hypothetical we could form our own
key escrow, and while we'd be subject to whatever the hypothetical
they would require for access, we could probably do things ilke inform
members of all key accesses/inquiries, etc.
In short, it bothers me a lot less than Dennings.

Yes but. The ole "chilling effect". Everyone talks about ENCRYPTION
and SECURITY, what I want is PRIVACY.
You can have privacy today, but if you have to sneak around, if
privacy is not the background assumption, it gravely limits your
ability to live and act freely.
Yes, you will always be able to find co-conspirators, but it would be
a weak version of the world in which we could presume privacy to
begin with.

 It's funny you should bring that up.  One of the major proponents of encryption here in Region 12 posted the following in the Regional Sysop Echo some time ago... Having said that, I also wonder whether this insistence upon having
everything in plain text isn't fostered by some sysops as a means of
receiving information that they otherwise wouldn't be privy to. If
one is truly paranoid ( *not* that I would fall into that category in anyone's wildest dreams...ahem), one should worry about why some
netmail is read so assiduosly by passthrough systems in the first place.
Fortunately, even mail that I send direct to nodes is quoted back and
often passes through a whole variety of systems for their inspection and
Since almost all of my netmail is incredibly innocent there might
always be the possibility that some of it will come back to hover
like a bad dream in some creative complaint. In broader legal terms,
every other communication system avoids eavesdropping on mail.
P.S. To understand how powerless you  are to prevent encrypted text, read the leftmost letter of each sentence in the last three paragraghs  He raises a valid point.  Sysops who are so paranoid about encrypted mail being sent through their systems should realize that they are really powerless to prevent it if somebody is determined enough to send a coded message to somebody else.   I've sought legal opinions in Canadian law (I don't know how it is in the U.S.) and I've discovered that the less I know about mail passing through my system, the safer I am.  If I keep every message on my system, and read them all, then I can be held liable if somebody routes something illegal through my system and it slips by me.  If I kill all passthrough mail, and read nothing except what is addressed to me, I am operating under common carrier status, and can't be held liable any more than Federal Express or UPS could.
 As a result, it's actually better to *encourage* people to send encrypted mail through your system.  The belief that if people are sending encrypted mail they're doing something wrong is a fallacy... then again, I'm preaching to the converted here.
