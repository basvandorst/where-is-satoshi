@_subject: [p2p-hackers] MixMinion vs. onion routing & GNUnet question 
These may be naive questions (I don't know GNUnet too well), but
hopefully I am about to learn something: GNUnet tries to achieve at
least three goals at the same time that are not perfectly understood
and should rather be treated individually:
 - anonymity
 - censor resistance
 - high-performance document distribution
What makes you believe the GNUnet-solution for any of these aims can
be factored out and used somewhere else?
Also, don't the shortcomings of mix networks also apply to Freenet- /
GNUnet-style anonymization schemes?  In Freenet (at least in some
ancient version that I once had a closer look at), I know security is
even worse (though still not too bad in my eyes), because the packets
don't all travel well-specified mix paths but take shortcuts.
To put it more clearly: A network has "perfect anonymity" if any peer
in that network can send and receive (variants: a - send only; b -
receive only) packets without the contents of the packets being
associated with its IP address by the adversary, and it has "high
anonymity" if it has perfect anonymity in every transaction with high
probability.  Then I suspect that no matter what (existing) adversary
model you pick, plugging a good mix network into your design on the
transport layer gives you the highest anonymity possible.
(And at a very good price, too: You can throw more resources at other
design requirements, you get more mature anonymity technology, and you
can profit from improvements in the field without changing your design
at all.)
Of course I'd need to define "good mix network" now.  But perhaps
somebody can already counter or confirm this as is?
