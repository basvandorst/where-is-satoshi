Does anyone have a utility to crack password encrypted/protected zip files?  Or an address to download one?  All replies / flames / pointers appreciated.

@_subject: Purple Boxes 
Actually quite a few hackers/phreaks have been encrypting phone conversations for a while.  Not by any complex mathematics but simple modifications to the phone frequencies...Don't have any sites handy but for those interested I'll look up some of my old
material.  I'll also check a large compendium of boxes to see if
Purple has been designated.  Anyone interested in box plans of different colors e-mail me.
