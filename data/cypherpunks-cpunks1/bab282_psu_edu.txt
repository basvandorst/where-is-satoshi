@_subject: Goldbach's Conjecture 
I could be wrong, but I thought Goldbach's conjecture was that every even
number could be expressed as the sum of *two* primes. This doesn't prohibit
repetition. Therefore, under Goldbach's conjecture:
4 -> 2 + 2
6 -> 3 + 3 but NOT 2 + 2 + 2
8 -> 5 + 3 but NOT 2 + 2 + 2
But I am a lowly freshman, so what do I know...

If we go with the flow and exclude 1 (so we don't have to rewrite all our
theorems) and assume that all even numbers greater than 2 can be represented
as a sum of two prime factors we have a problem...
How does one sum 4?
2 + 2?
We certainly can't use 3 + 1. If we allow repetition *and* the number 2 as a
prime then all even numbers can be written as a string of 2's summed

@_subject: Goldbach's Conjecture (fwd) 
"It was conjectured by Charles Goldbach in 1742 that every even integer
larger than 4 is the sum of two odd primes.  (All primes except 2 are odd,
of course, since evenness means divisibility by two.)"
Anderson, pg. 82:
"Goldbach's conjecture. Is every even number expressible as the sum of two
"Goldbach's original conjecture, written in a 1742 letter to Euler, states
that every Integer >5 is the Sum of three Primes. As re-expressed by Euler,
an equivalent of this Conjecture (called the ``strong'' Goldbach conjecture)
asserts that all Positive Even Integers >= 4 can be expressed as the Sum of
two Primes."
Am I misreading somewhere?

No, that was Fermat, Goldbach just says every even number greater than two
can be represented as a sum of primes. Basicaly Fermat says that if we have
n primes we can reduce them to 2 primes only, in all cases. Which happens to
exclude using equilateral triangles as a test bed since you can't tile a
equilateral with only two other equilaterals, you could use rectangles
So basicaly from a geometric perspective Fermat says that given a rectangle
even area it is possible to divide it with a bisector into two rectangles of
prime area.
It's interesting that Fermat doesn't mention that the only prime that can
use two as a factor is 4. And you can't factor 2 at all since we eliminate
1 as a potential candidate (another issue of symmetry breaking simply so we
don't have to write '....works for every prime but 1' on all our theorems).
The real issue for me is the interaction of primes (ie n * 1 = n) and the
identity theorem (ie n * 1 = n). They're opposite sides of the same coin.
It doesn't really matter now since it doesn't look like I'm going to get a
copy of EURISKO in this lifetime to play with.

@_subject: Goldbach's Conjecture (fwd) 
First, let me add yet another reference. This one is from _Number Theory in
Science and Communication_ by M.R. Schroder, pg. 96:
"One of the most enduring (if not endearing) conjectures is the famous
Goldbach conjecture, asserting that every even number >4 is the sum of two
I would argue they're all essentially equivalent.  Here's how they all
Goldbach's conjecture is that every even number is expressible as the sum of
TWO primes.
The variations are: (1)Goldbach's "original" conjecture versus his revised
conjecture after communication with Euler and (2) excluding four while
adding an odd-primes-only condition (four IS the sum of two EVEN primes,
namely 2 and 2). I think these variations are simply different depths/points
of view of the same idea and one who focuses on semantic differences is
missing the point.
Cutting to the chase, Goldbach's conjecture concerns the sum of EXACTLY TWO
primes stands, and your statement "If we allow repetition *and* the number 2
as a prime then all even numbers can be written as a string of 2's summed
appropriately" is thereby contradicted.
Let me conclude with this inspirational quote from a man whose name escapes
me: "Young men should write proofs, old men should write books." ; )

Ok, so this one says it was Goldbach himself and in particular states two
odd primes completely eliminating 4 from the get go ...
This one is the second version...
And finaly a third completely different slant. They at least get Fermats
contribution right.
Well I'd say that all three of your references tended to contradict each
other. Which one do you want to stand on?
This is my quote:
I'll stand by this statement.

A group is only as useful as the special and similar properties items in the
group share. Primes are no exception. One isn't included in the set of
primes because it has special properties beyond or inconsistent with the
properties of primes. As to the notion that implementing your brilliant idea
"would [perhaps] provide a more consistent base and just maybe some of the
extant problems in number theory might become solvable in other ways", all I
can say is Puhleez... In Gauss, Fermat, Wiles, et al versus Jim Choate, I'd
put my money on the former.
Sorry for the rude response, I just don't like being sent hostile messages

No, I made a typo. I got so focused on primes last nite that I seem to have
typed it in instead of 'even'. I didn't notice it when I saw it posted to
the list. My mistake, sorry for the confusion.
What started this whole enquiry for me was the realization that the
multiplication identity axiom is related to the definition of a prime. Then
add on top of that the reason we exclude 1 is so we don't have to write
'...except for the prime 1' on the end of lots of number theory (re Richard
Feynman's comment during the Challenger Investigation). It was the
realization that if we go ahead and include 1 so the axioms are in line with
each other (and use our cut&paste feature for the '...1...') then perhaps it
would provide a more consistent base and just maybe some of the extant
problems in number theory might become solvable in other ways. My original
intention was to get a copy of Doug Lenat's EURISKO theorem proving program
and change the definition of prime in its database and note the results
(after converting it to Perl from LISP). What started all that is that I'm
slowly going through 'An Introduction to Algebraic Structures' by J. Landin
(Dover) creating a cheat-sheet of number theory that eventualy I hope to
on my webpage for reference.
