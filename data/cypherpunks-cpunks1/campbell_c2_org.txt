    P.S. I have an alpha version of a program which may be of interest to
    technomads: it automatically executes scripts received by email from a
    remote machine and then mails back the results.  The scripts (shell
    scripts, perl scripts, or whatever) are encrypted and signed with PGP
    before being sent to provide security and prevent unauthorized users
    from executing scripts on your machine.  The program runs on unix
    systems, and submissions can be from anything that runs PGP and is able
    to send email.  See:
Does your mechanism do anything to prevent replay attacks?

    BTW: When is this list/listserver going to convert the reply-to fields to          point to cypherpunks at toad.com?
Hopefully never.  It's the wrong way for a distribution list to work.
If you personally want replies to just go to the list, then you can
add a reply-to field in your message.  I prefer when people do a
standard `reply all' to reply to me and CC the recipients of my
message.  In that way, I can file messages to a list in a folder while
treating those that are explicitly specially -- I might want to see
them sooner so as to reply sooner.
The distribution list should just distribute messages.  The sender
should determine the addressing.

It looks like the original headers got stripped off of this (at
toad?).  Could the author of xnoisesph.c please contact me directly?
I have some questions about the code.  Thanks.
