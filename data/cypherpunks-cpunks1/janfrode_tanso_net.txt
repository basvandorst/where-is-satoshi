@_subject: [tor-talk] About time to make BitTorrent work over Tor, 
By adding TOR exit-node functionality into the bittorrent clients, and
giving bittorrent credit score to clients with lots of TOR-traffic. That
would scale the TOR network, and also give plausible deniability to
direct downloads ("wasn't me, it was the TOR exit" ;-)
