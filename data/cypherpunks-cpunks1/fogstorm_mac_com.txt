So if an Australian puts it on his web site can the German government sue for
copyright infringement? Can they prosecute for violation of their anti Nazi
laws? If a German citizen views it in Amsterdam can his government prosecute
when he returns home?

Surely they don't intend to outlaw using the words at all. Even outlawing the use of specific words in specific contexts would probably be difficult to enforce as a practical matter. The only way I can forsee this being used is as an enhancment charge like when a person is sometimes charged with carrying a gun during commision of a felony even if it's not displayed or used.

MAGIC LANTERN installs so-called keylogging software on a machine that is capable of capturing keystrokes typed on a computer. By exactly what a suspect types, critical encryption key information can be
gathered, and then transmitted back to the FBI, according to the source, requested anonymity.
       The virus can be sent to the suspect via e-mail  perhaps sent for the
FBI by a trusted friend or relative. The FBI can also use common to break into a suspect's computer and insert Magic Lantern, the source        Magic Lantern is one of a series of enhancements currently being
developed for the FBI's Carnivore project, the source said, under the project name of Cyber Knight.

Sending anthrax through the mail could be an effective terror tactic. Anthrax if mailed to the media will help generate hysteria - frightened people who are largely ignorant about anthrax other than Anthrax + People = Death and who can disseminate news/rumor/fear to a great many people quickly. Even if there are few deaths the economic impact could be pretty big as people panic and refuse to open mail from strangers.
If someone want to target journalists it's not going to be all that hard to determine where journalists live.

Maybe they're just starting to get real world operational experience in bio-warfare. Their first attack on the WTC was amazingly incompetent the second worked all to well. If this is in fact an attack I expect they'll study the outcome and try to improve their delivery methodology.

I've no idea how any of these measures are supposed to inhibit *suicide*  has this to say about it:
BART will increase police presence throughout its mass-transit train system, close all station rest-rooms and remove all garbage containers from the platform level as part of heightened security measures.
Bay Area Rapid Transit will continue to monitor all trains in key locations, including both ends of the Transbay Tube between San Francisco and Oakland, a move that began after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast.
BART also said elevators serving subway stations on the system will temporarily operate on an on-call basis, with users contacting station agents through an intercom.
BART, which carries more than 330,000 commuters a day, also is urging passengers to not leave packages, suitcases or other large items on cars or trains.

"Certain information, while not specific as to target, gives the government reason to believe that there may be additional terrorist attacks within the United States and against U.S. interests overseas over the next several days.

New York City health officials will test Newsweek's photo department and mailrooms for anthrax today, and parts of the newsweekly's 15th floor offices were sealed in midtown Manhattan, after an unidentified photo staffer reported flu-like symptoms, a Newsweek spokesman said.
Newsweek execs contacted city officials Monday night after being notified by the employee, who weeks ago opened a suspicious package.
A spokesman for nearby Time Inc., publisher of Time and People, said no suspicious illnesses have been reported at the Time & Life Building.

@_subject: The end of the Fourth Amendment 
Most people who detect an intruder in their homes going through their aren't going to think "This must be a government agent performing an appropriately authorized black bag job." They're going to think "Holy shit! There's a criminal in my house." and do whatever they feel is necessary to defend their loved ones.
So lets say a hypothetical woman named "Sue" ventilates "Agent Smith" (who she perceives as a burglar & possibly a rapist) with her twelve gauge. Will she be charged with a crime? Will she be "detained" until such time as the Feds have finished determining her involvement with terrorism? If she asserts her fifth amendment right to not answer questions will the FBI torture her until she "admits" she is a terrorist?
