This Mexican bird called the bee martin ruffs its head
feathers so they look like a flower. The honey bee lands
therein. Or tries to. Doesn't make it. The bird -- snap,
snap -- eats the bee. That's nature. Deceptive. Vicious.

"Toto" is actually an anonymous pseudonym of Adam Back, who resents
Tim May's respected position on the list. "TruthMonger" posts are usually written by John Young and Robert Hettinga as a result of having the same drug connections and thus a common outlook on life
when they are stoned out of their gourds.
  Lucky Green's recent posts are actually forgeries done by snow, and
Kent Crispin has been sending posts purporting to be from Dr. Vulis.
  The fact is, forgeries have gotten so out of hand on the cypherpunks
list that even the "can i join" and "subscribe me" posts of late are
probably coming from John Gilmore, who is forging AOL return addresses
in an attempt to bring calls for his return to hosting the list in
order to save us from "The Night of the Living Newbies."
