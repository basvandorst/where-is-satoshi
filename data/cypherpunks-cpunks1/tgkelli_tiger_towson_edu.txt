@_subject: Today's hearing (Re: Dorthy Denning is a boot-licking fasicist!!!) 
I was there today in DC at the hearing.  Settle down.  Neither of them was _that_ bad... just business as usual.
My favorite Denning remark though, was when PRZ brought up the fact taht
the FBI's latest legislative goal had been to obtain the
capability/permission to wiretap 1% of the population, and she tried to
refute it.  (It was later brought up by an audience member from the ACLU
that Louis Freeh's remarks to those effect were in the congressional
Reinsch's shining moments came when he became so worn down by the
opposition that he made the "look, it was Clinton's order.  He's my boss,
so i just have to do what he says" type of response.
Dan Geer, of Open Market, and (umm...somebody) of Open Vision systems also
did very well.
Neither Denning nor Reinsch is an elected official.  Any president we
elect, unless they run with a specific pro-crypto plank in their platform
will do the same thing...they're all in bed with the LEA's.

GAK - An acronym coined by cryptographer Carl Ellison (presently employed
by Cybercash) which stands for Government Access to Keys.  It's a
standardized term we (we = folks who are actually interested in the study
of cryptography and the development of public policy surrounding it) use
in the face of constantly changing government terms for what (to us) translates to being exactly the same (unacceptable) policy (Key Escrow,
Key Recovery and the various phases of the Clipper development). A brief word on abuse... by calling Gilmore or anybody else a "faggot"
doesn't win me over to your cause, as is the case with many others on the
cypherpunks list.  Further, while I may not agree with Dr. Denning's
perspective on these issues, I respect her as a writer, a cryptographer,
and as a computer scientist.  I also (groan if you must)  admire her as a
woman who has maintained such a high-profile position in such a religious
debate, given that she probably gets mail like yours all the time. The Semi-Carless Kathleen Ellis    NEW ADDRESS: tgkelli at tiger.towson.edu
