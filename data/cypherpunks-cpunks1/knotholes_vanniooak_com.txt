@_subject: We know the way to wake your small  friend up.  
here's an irish blessing from us to you...
4. i don't worry about a little "creative clutter" in cate's room. i say, a good dress up/ barbie mess day better than watching tv all afternoon, right? pretty soon i will just put my 'kerchief on again and go to town. (yes, that is what cate's room looks like again, just over a month after the big clean. i tell you, i'm fighting a losing battle with that girl). does that answer your question, mary? i hope it helps! wink.
she's amazing. it was super delicious. i found that amazing old shirt (we're big fans) at the thrift store for $1 and it's so soft. i always enjoy knitting lacy stuff but this pattern was especially fun, super easy, and portable.
my happy plans for this evening include knitting and watching two favorite movies: far and away followed by tristan and isolde.
with the sun streaming in
when she does these weekends she fills up really fast so don't wait- if you need color and/or cut and/or face waxing at very reasonable prices email her promptly and she'll get you booked and give you directions. ok, i'm off to knit...
1. in the craft room i throw everything on the homework table. that clears up the floor for more mess craft making. in a tiny town in idaho
i want those red boots and that coat. i am determined to get the house clean so i can relax and sew tomorrow.
i love the comments i get from all of you. it's definately worth the long drive,
3. i think that packages stacked all over the house are a nice decorative touch (and they remind me how good people are to donate to project 31) happy things! they make me smile every day. she never looks like a senator from krypton on the red carpet. i was chuckling while i cooked thinking about how my irish grandparents always had a plaque on their wall with this prayer on it: "may you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows your dead" ha!
