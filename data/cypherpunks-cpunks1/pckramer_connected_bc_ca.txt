hey heres another completely safe hommade bomb thats a little funner
heres what you nead
1. a jar with a screw on lid preferably plastic because it dosn't shatter
that can hold about a cup of water
2. a small container that can hold three or four tabelspoons of water a film
canaster will do fine
3. baking soda
4. vinager
5. water baloon
6. nail (optional)
7. dish soap or bubble bath whatever you got that makes bubbles
heres how you do it
1.fill the film container with baking soda but not all the way
2. film the plastic jar with vinager and about some dish soap but no all the
way to the top (about four tabelspoons will do it for dish soap but other
stuff may take more or less)
3. take the lid of the plastic container poke a very small hole about the
radius of a pencil than put the water baloon in it and glue it in good on
both sides I suggest a glue gun or wood glue not whight school glue
4. heres the trickey part put the film container in the jar so that it
floats you may have to take some baking soda out
5. screw the lid on tight
6. now you nead to be carefull not to tip or bump it at all when you are
ready when you are shake it this makes the vinager and baking soda combine
making the baloon expand and popping spraying foam everywhere
7. if the baloon doesn't explode look inside if their is lots of vinager
left you nead more baking soda if their is lots of baking soda left you nead
more vinager
8. if you still cant get it to xplodde glue a nail so it will poke the
baloon when the baloon expands
WARNING be carefull not to get the foam in youre eyes its vinager so it will
