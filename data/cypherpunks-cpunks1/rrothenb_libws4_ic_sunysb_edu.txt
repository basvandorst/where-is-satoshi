@_subject: How "good" is MDC? 
I've been toying with a homegrown implementation of the MDC algorithm,
similar to the one used in HPack, written mostly in 386 assembler though.
My version also scrambles the constants by multiple cycles over the key,
so it should be better the vanilla MD5... I'm wondering how "secure" MDC
is, though... are there better hashing algorithms or possible modifications
that could be made?
(A silly question considering I haven't yet released the sources.  When
they are ready I'll post an announcement or something.)

: But, here it is, the source code for a keyboard sniffer program.

: how insecure most of these programs are.

I've thought about that problem too for terminal as well as crypto,
(after seeing an article in 2600 about sniffing a roommate's passwords
to the "K00L EL1T3 B0ARDZ") and started on a small "secure" keyboard
Here it is, though in very incomplete form.  It ignores Pause, Cntl-
Break and PrintScreen and doesn't make an annoying noise when the buffer is full, and may not work entirely for enhanced keyboards (since
I do not own one to test it on). There's plenty of room for improvement
in this, I'm sure...
It does have some features like random-noise sampling, "SuperKey" codes
and multiple keypress maps (as well as an option to hook into Interrupt
0x16 if security isn't a pariority).
The interface is in Turbo Pascal because I haven't made the migration
to C yet (don't flame).  Any help with fix-ups, improvements a C-
interface and constructive suggestions would be appreciated.
I've tested it with KeyTrap and it *seems* safe from such monitoring

Yep, and I've already got a couple of other like it from other sources.
I also posted a semi-solution to the problem. If it doesn't show up,
let me know and I'll repost it.

@_subject: Another problem w/Data Havens... 
I can see a potential problem with Data Havens (as they've been discussed
here) that may very well inspire the wrath of the authorities more than
nuclear secrets or dirty pictures of J.Edgar Hoover...
How does one keep a site from becomming a remote pirated-software exchange
site? (Esp. since after that MIT case laws may be changed...) It seems that
such a service could become a magnet for the "elite warez" crowd... and even
if the operator isn't jailed it could lead to a shutdown of the service.

@_subject: Another problem w/Data Havens... 
Assuming that data haven does. I imagine some wouldn't, to allow for long-
term storage or retrieval by multiple parties (which, for data havens to be
viable as a commodity would probably be supported in some way as a feature)

I'm not saying anything is wrong with it.... just that it is a problem
that can lead the "authorities" to try to shut down the site, esp. when
the pornography bogieman wears out (pun intended ;).  Strangely, even
though it's more socially acceptable for people to use "borrowed" wares
there's poorer arguments for defending it than "pornography"... hardly
any cries of foul happen when a board or site is busted for pirated
software than pornography.
Basically, what I'm saying is that it's an issue that data haven admins
should keep in mind (esp. if there's a fee): perhaps they can most safely
be run in jurisdictions with lax or no copyright laws.

@_subject: Another problem w/Data Havens... 
Hmmm.... Of course in some cases one may not want the file to be returned
with a signature and timestamp (might be incriminating evidence, depending
on what one wants stored and the overall political situation where one is,
etc....).  Of course that does sound useful.

[ .. ]
Hmmm... then why use a data haven at all?  Split the file into small
pieces, encrypt each and post each piece in a newsgroups (the pieces may
even be posted as small garbles of data in sigs?).  When you need to recover the file checksites which archive those newsgroups.
Just a thought. It's probably quite doable for small files.
Another idea: use encryption/secret sharing combined with steganography
and upload copies of the said files to various ftp-sties or BBS's. (It
may be that this is more secure than data havens, since few SysAdmins
would bother checking for steganographically hidden files...)
