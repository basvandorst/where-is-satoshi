Dear Friend, The following is Part I of a two part program sent to me. This new program will cost you NOTHING to join!! We will be using the same multi-level principles as the $5 program, but you will not have to send $5 to anyone. In fact, we'll be using as a vehicle a company already in existence which pays you $2 to sign up! You have the potential to make a $16,000 easily and legally, using the compensation plan of an already existing internet company. The program has been divided into two parts so as to minimize the risk of damage due to spam (did I mention don't spam?? :)). Email me immediately that you're interested and I will send you Part II which contains the real meat of the program. My friend from my upline warns it will be to your best advantage if you join immediately because this new company will take off fast! I am REALLY excited about this one!! I hope to hear from you soon! Dixie The program introduction and instructions start below the line: ___________________________ BEGINNING NOTE: Save a copy of this email because you will use it later on when you join the program. *********************************************************** ***THIS IS PART I OF OUR 2-PART PROGRAM*** *********************************************************** Introducing... "THE MOTHER OF ALL FREE AFFILIATE $$$ MAKING IDEAS!" "Chain Letter" type programs have a BAD REPUTATION! They break down for several reasons, but the primary one is the fear of being "ripped off" when you are asked to send money to total strangers. Also, a secondary fear...you might just be doing something illegal or unethical. And lastly, just one spamming entrant to a list will cause ALL accounts on the list to be cancelled by their respective service providers.  Consequently, the program runs of all participants on the list are aborted...stopped dead on their tracks! Thus you will hear the most common snide remark against chain-
letter programs: "I tried it...but it NEVER worked!" Our answer to the first 2 concerns is in the cost of the program... ************************************ Make it ABSOLUTELY FREE!!! ************************************ *~ NO Sign-up Fees! *~ NO Postage and Handling Fees! *~ NO Backorders of Delivery Delays! *~ NO Meetings! *~ NO "Now you have to Upgrade to make your $$$!" *~ NO One loses one cent! Because it is FREE, it is legal, moral and ethical. As for the last concern, the present program now contains... ***************************************** BUILT-IN  SECURITY MEASURES ***************************************** BONUS!!!  Participation in the program will generate for you 3 safe lists corresponding to 3 different levels in the program. MORE BONUS!!!  Get 4 FREE SOFTWARE PROGRAMS that you can use for this program. OK!  Send me Part II so that I will know how to... **************************************** GET $16,000 in just a few weeks!!! **************************************** TO JOIN THE PROGRAM, JUST REPLY TO THIS EMAIL with the subject "I AM JOINING". (When replying, it is required that you quote the entire text of this email. Set your email client's "Reply Setting" to automatically quote the original message.
