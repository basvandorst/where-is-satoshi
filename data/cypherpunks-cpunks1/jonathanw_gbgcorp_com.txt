@_subject: Choices of small handguns 
I have a Para-Ordnance P10.45, a 1911 variant with a double-stack 10 rd magazine and a shortened grip. it is a little on the wide side for true concealed carry, but it is very compact and 10 rounds of 45 ACP is sufficient for most concealed carry tasks. I have the steel version, and I like it very much. It has a chunky feel to it and is surprisingly controllable and accurate for such a small gun. It shoots comfortably, too at least with the Hogue grip I put on it. It's well worth considering for a CCW.

@_subject: Freeware barcode scanner utility 
Many of you may be familiar with the cuecat barcode scanner being given away
at Radio Shack and elsewhere. It reads most types of barcodes including UPC,
ISBN and even the tracking numbers on UPS packages. The software that comes
with the cuecat is supposed to be snoopware--it is designed to send
everything you scan to an internet database, which points you to a web site
related to the product you just scanned. I never installed the driver
software, but instead wrote a VB program that reads the output of the
scanner, displays the data in a text box, and optionally automatically
copies it to the clipboard without generating any network traffic. Enjoy!

@_subject: General Ashcroft make his move 
Hash: SHA1
I get the NRA's American Rifleman magazine. The July issue also has
an article about Ashcroft's letter, which does not quote the rather
lengthy footnote. However, it does contain a legible image of BOTH
pages of the letter, including the ENTIRE text of the footnote. This
is hardly the action of an organization bent on distorting Ashcroft's
view on the Second Amendment. Stupid editing on the part of the
America's First Freedom team, perhaps, but not an organization-wide

I don't have the magazine in front of me, but if you'd like, I could
scan the page and send you a JPEG or something like that of it. I
don't think the NRA is as good a defender of the Second Amendment as
it could be, and ditto with John Ashcroft, but at least they aren't
trying to totally nuke our freedoms like Clinton, Janet Reno &
Handgun Control Incorporated.

The American Rifleman article with the complete text of the John

on pages 62 and 63, not the July issue. My apologies for the mix-up.

I can fire 9 shots in about 4 seconds and stay in the 9 ring of a
B-27 silhouette at 10 yards, and slow fire I can neatly remove the
X-ring at the same distance...I don't think it would be a bad option
against an armored opponent--2 in the body to knock them on their
behind, then one more between the eyes to finish things. The only
real drawback is the muzzle flash would be a problem in the dark.
With the standard 6 inch barrel, the flame is about a foot in
diameter and 2-3 feet long with some loads. Now when I attach the 14"
barrel with the scope, I can put 5 shots in about 2 inches at 50
yards, and the muzzle flash is greatly reduced due to the increased
barrel length. It is definitely on the heavy and bulky side for
concealed carry, but I wouldn't agree that it is impractical.

I also own a Para-Ordnance P10, a subcompact 1911 variant with a
3-inch barrel, a 2 finger grip (unless you have the Pearce magazine
floorplates with the pinkie rest) and a 10-round magazine. I am fond
of it, and can shoot approximately 2" groups with it at 10 yards. I
think it would be a decent choice for general self-defense, but I
wouldn't really want to use it against an armored opponent since a
.45 ACP's relatively low velocity and large frontal area equate to
poor armor penetration. It is certainly lighter and more concealable
than my Desert Eagle, though.
Of course a MAK-90 with a 75-round drum has merit in a scenario
involving armored home invaders...

Last year I used a duffel bag as a carry-on that I occasionally use to transport firearms. I was pulled out of line at the checkpoint and they spent about 10 minutes swabbing the bag and examining it before I was allowed to board the plane.

Airport chemical "sniffers" apparently look for the signature of nitrogen
compounds, not "explosives," per se.  I've often wondered how many weekend
gardeners have gotten hassled and delayed because of trace amounts of
ammonia-based fertilizers on their person and effects.  If you plan to fly,
be sure to wash your hands thoroughly before heading out for the airport if
you have been shoot, gardening or house cleaning.

An even better solution: a USB compact flash card reader. $30 at CompUSA or other fine electronics retailers, and $20 or less for a 16 MB compact flash card. This way more space than any normal person is going to need for PGP keyrings, with enough room left for your randseed file and other stuff like that, and at a price ($50 or so) that most anyone can afford. It is also transportable from computer to computer, so you could use it sneakernet style if you wanted to, especially if you get more/larger cards. 256MB cards are available for about $200, and a 1GB Microdrive runs around $400. Either of these could be carried in various orifices in extreme circumstances. :-)

I hate to trigger Godwin's Law so soon (though somebody else already did it),
but are there any Bay Area tattoo shops that want to volunteer to help
with the National ID numbers?
