Does anyone know how to get MacPGP to sign with a different secret key then
it's orginal one? I have two different keys in secring.pgp, but MacPGP refuses
to accept the new one. I even made two seperate secret rings (one for each)
and when I try the ring with the newer key in it, it tells me that it can't
find my other key. This is fustrating for me. 2.3 lets me pick my key, and 2.6 will only let me use one. Anybody have a solution???                              Thanks in advance.
ps - I wish MIT had come out with a MacPGP2.5 release.                       Joseph R. Rach                     Delaware Technical and Community College

I got it to work finally!!! I have to change config.txt and restart the application in order to use both keys. The menu after selecting file-
encrypt/sign no longer exists? Is the wipe file option still part of the
  I'd like to suggest that the next release of USA legal MacPGP have the
option to choose MyName within the program. It's a pain to edit config.txt,
quit, and restart the program everytime you want to choose a different
secret key.
  I congradulate all the work and effort put into this program. It's truely
                              Thanks again...

Hello Fellow Cypherpunks,
  I need help compiling PGP on DG/UX Release 5.4R3.00 AViiON.. There is no
target in the makefile that really fits the system here. I have consulted
the sysadm here and he told me to try adding  into the source, like
   BSD_SOURCE
   BSD_FLAVOR
   SVR4_SOURCE
   BSD_TTY_FLAVOR
  I don't want to fudge up the executable, and this isn't working. Someone
mentioned to me that i could try make portable. That did not work either.
I have gotten it to compile an executable, but only after giving me several
errors.   I have a little knowledge of c, so i don't need a complete hand holding.
If someone would extend a helping hand, i'd appreciate it. On a side note, i
have gotten the sysadm here to agree to install PGP2.5, should i be able to compile it and i let him know i did it! He won't install 2.3a. ;<..   I'm using one of the crippled executables to sign this message.                       Thanks in advance,
                      Joseph R. Rach.
