          CryptoSampler, from National Semiconductor, Demonstrates Ease of
     Building Secure Electronic Commerce and Communications
                          Applications
   Company's iPower(tm) Business Unit Launches Free CryptoSolver
                   to Inaugurate New Web Site
SANTA CLARA, Calif., November 27, 1995 --- National Semiconductor
Corporation today announced the availability of its CryptoSampler
package for applications developers interested in gaining a "hands on"
understanding of how cryptography solves modern business problems.
Developed by National's iPower Business Unit, the program consists of
three demonstration applications and the PersonaCard(tm) 100, a
hardware token for personal, portable data security.
     The package contains both the demonstration applications
including  "build-it- yourself" tools to integrate security easily
into electronic commerce and communications applications. Priced at
$129, the CryptoSampler package is available to the first 1,000 U. S.
respondents and can be ordered directly from National's iPower
Business Unit.
     In a related move, the company's iPower Business Unit launched
its own web site along with CryptoSolver, an interactive game that
invites participants to solve encrypted messages based on the concepts
of substitution ciphers and the alphabetic frequency table.
CryptoSolver, a technology-teaser game rates players' deciphering
skills and can be downloaded from iPower's new web site free.
"As networks become the lifeblood of corporations and the principal
means of commerce, securing electronic transactions and proprietary
information over public and private networks is absolutely critical,"
said Tom Rowley, marketing director for National's iPower Business
Unit. "Through this program, we hope to help broaden individual's
understanding of how modern security technology can solve real
problems on the Internet and in Electronic Commerce business
applications," Rowley explained.
CryptoSampler Package - Token Plus Three Applications in One
     The CryptoSampler package is available with or without a PC Card
Reader. For those who plan to run CryptoSampler applications on a
desktop or portable personal computer already equipped with a PC Card
slot, the basic package is offered at a special price of $129
(including handling and shipping). A CryptoSampler package with PC
Card reader is available for $199. The total retail value of the basic
package and configuration with card reader is $300 and $500,
     To order  the CryptoSampler package in either configuration, call
1-800-272-9959 Ext# 631 between the hours of 7 AM and 7 PM Central
Standard Time.  To play CryptoSolver and for more information about
the CryptoSampler program, see the iPower web site at

Gidday all
I emailed Jim Clark day before yesterday about his comments re key escrow.
He responded.  As it's not good form to post private email, might I suggest
that one of the 'elders' here put to Jim a list of questions on the proviso
that his answers can be posted to the list.  You never know, a lot of
speculation might be confirmed or denied.

Failed transactions are more likely to affect consumer confidence than
trader confidence.  I have yet to find a site on the net where goods are
shipped before receiving payment, therefore the 'at risk' party is the
buyer. Cybertraders will need to establish a level of credibility and
reliability on a par with their terrestrial cousins.  Cyberbuyers will need
to be confident in their ability to call upon yet unwritten international
laws to gain a refund or replacement when goods and services don't arrive as
BTW do you want to buy a really big rock way out in the middle of nowhere?  [:>)

@_subject: Need advice on video 
Ben wrote...
Firstly you will need to clearly define for yourself exactly what you want the
audience to know by the end of the programme... the content.  And what you want them to feel by the end of the programme too.. you obviously want them to have positive feelings about crypto.  You might also consider some broader political issues to be cleanly interwoven through the script too.
Then, you might like to think about the WHO, WHEN, WHERE and WHY of crypto.  A bit of an historical background on cyphers would put todays crypto into context, too.  Make sure that you keep giving the audience enough knowledge
to comprehend stuff you will be presenting towards the end of the video...
all of the
information you present needs to build on what you have already presented.
Closely examine your scripts for jargon.  Take out any that you can't
explain clearly.
Too much jargon can swamp the audience and they will be distracted from
content while they try to remember what a particular word means.
I'm sure there is a need for this sort of programme that is produced well and
is reasonably priced.  Remember to get signed releases from EVERYONE involved in the project, not just ppl on camera, so you can sell the programme
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD if you choose to.
Don't be misled, I'm sure there are quite a few programmes out there on this
very topic.
Yours needs to be significantly different and entertaining.  I would suggest
you have an opportunity to make a video from 'the inside', given the ppl on this list
and the contacts they have.  A lot of films sre good introductions to a subject without
standing up and calling them such... like if I was making a video about Phil I would have to
explain crypto
and its use as a way of reaching a level of understanding for the audience.
Hope this is of some help.
