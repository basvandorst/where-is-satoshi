So Dr. Cohen, what do you use when you want to send a message across
the Internet with better security than cleartext?  What do your
recommend to others?

@_subject: What do I use? 
Ok.  IMHO, that's a perfectly valid position.  Under what
circumstances do you consider pgp to be a suitable tool?  Do you think
there is a better tool under similar circumstances?

@_subject: Why DES in IPSEC ESP? 
Because people were going completely nuts about mandating something
not easily specifiable at all.  DES was an easier case to make than
Shipping is irrelevant.  Perry is busily coding 3DES support into
NetBSD.  Once it's in the bsd network stack, it will spread
everywhere.  Presumably, someone will implement it outside the US as
As Perry put it succinctly at a recent IETF meeting, people will not
necessarily use what is mandated.  They will use what is available.
If 3DES is in the freely available reference implementation (which it
will be), and it performs adequately, that is what will get used.

I can think of a at least half a dozen cypherpunks who will be going
to IETF in Stockholm in July.  I suspect there are more.  Perhaps we
should all arrange to take the same flight, while carrying some bit of
approved-for-export material.  Should drive the Customs guys
completely nuts.

@_subject: CERT statement 
You're exactly right.  However, getting people to deploy real security
systems is nearly impossible.  My company sells a kerberos system, and
although everyone is saying they want security, nobody really
understands what this means, and as soon as we tell them that it
actually involves effort, they become far less interested.  Even
though I've seen companies get hosed because of lame security, the
people who matter aren't willing to commit.
I'm hoping that as firewalls begin to fall, that the CERT will stop
recommending half-assed solutions.  We'll have to wait and see.

No, but kerberos or something like it is necessary.  And I think I can
safely say that anything which really defends against TCP sequence
spoofing or hijacking attacks will be more invasive and require more
effort than kerberos, not less.

@_subject: ESP Unix encrypted session protocol software 
Matt, why did you choose to implement your own protocol instead of
adding a DH authentication/encryption type to telnet?
