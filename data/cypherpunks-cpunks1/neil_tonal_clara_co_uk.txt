"Tiny fraction" is putting it mildly. I once considered starting up a  low-infrastructure wireless ISP using mesh radio based on wifi radio  technology adapted to work in licensed bands.
If you work out the numbers, the bandwidth you get in any substantial  deployment is pitiful compared to technologies like DSL and cable modems, let alone fiber.
New technologies such as distributed space-time multipath coding on the  wireless side, and multipath network coding on the bitstream side, look  like the way forward on this, but these are brand new, and still the  subject of research -- you certainly can't just hot-wire these onto wifi  The fact that the usable bandwidth resulting from ad-hoc mesh wiki would  be tiny compared to broadband connections doesn't mean this sort of thing isn't worth trying: a few tens of kilobits a second is plenty for speech, and even a few hundred bits per second useful for basic text messaging.
Given that the cost of doing this is almost zero, since only software is  required to implement it on any modern wifi/GPS equipped mobile hardware, this seems like a great thing to have in the general portfolio of networking technologies: having something like this available could be invaluable in disaster/crisis situations.
