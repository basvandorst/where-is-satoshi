That works in that scenario, but you do have to monitor *every* house, and
continually, if you want to catch a software pirate.. in the satellite
scenario, they're just looking for a signal to see if it exists or not.  In
the M$ scheme, you'd have to get the license key and compare it against a
database to see if that license key was in use by anyone else at that exact
moment... it's not illegal to use multiple copies of the same piece of
software, it's just illegal to use them concurrently.

In almost every writing I've come across regarding Van Eck, I notice the
phrase "...simply a modified television" or something along those lines.
Does anyone have a document for actually modifying a television set to do
this sort of thing?  It doesn't have to be extremely long ranged, and could
in fact be very short range.. I am interested in performing my own
experiments into defeating this sort of eavesdropping.
Also, would it be possible to scramble the signal into an unusable level by
simply putting another device emanating RF at the snooping frequencies
nearby the machine that you want to protect?  Something generating white
noise at that frequency, but with a purposely built antenna, say a high
gain type turned outward from the monitor, with a significantly higher
power output than the monitor?

While I agree with you in that total security is only possible if you
completely isolate the system, I think that the original person posting
wasn't referring to the batteries, but rather the conditioning that is
going on inside the UPS.  Any decent ups will put the incoming power
through a "conditioner" that will filter out noise in the incoming power,
and rebuild the wave so that transient sags and spikes don't get through.
It stands to reason that these filters would work in reverse, since they
are AC filters.  Most AC circutry works equally well in reverse as forward.
 DC circuitry would probably filter out noise equally as well since it
simply won't work in reverse for the most part, it'll simply resist any
reverse current until it blows.
Of course, I make no claims about noise that the transformer itself may
make while it does it's filtering that someone might be able to use to
determine what was filtered out.

I think stan just confused UPS's with power strips.
most of them don't have a switching time fast enough to stop lightning.

hmm?  heh.. hey, I was just trying to help you out man.. I haven't heard of
a UPS that won't protect against a lightning strike..
I get bitched at by list members when I sign my messages.. :)  If I have
something important to say, I'll sign it.. same goes if people start faking
them, so far no one has.

Actually, I said what I meant to say.  If someone fakes it to the list,
then I'll see it now won't I, unless there is another attack or five
happening at the same time to prevent me from getting my mail from the
list, and from getting it anywhere else.
If I saw it then I would post a signed message informing everyone that I
*hadn't* posted it, and continue signing my mails until I felt it was safe
to do otherwise.
Don't feel you have to continue to illustrate your point though, even
though investigation of the headers shows that the message actually
originated from a mail server in canada.. I know you didn't do as much as
you could have to make the message appear authentic.
In any case, I don't see you signing your messages either.
