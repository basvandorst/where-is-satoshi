I don't know much about crypto politics, but...  isn't it utterly
obvious that the mere fact that the NSA suggest a certain algorithm (say
Rijndael) for a national standard and recomends its use internationally
imply that they have a pretty darn good idea (if not actual technology)
on how to break it efficiently?  I just don't see why else they would
advocate its use.  After all isn't the fact that NSA could break DES since the 70's the reason for the 'success' of DES?

That's shame indeed.  Couldn't whoever's running cypherpunks setup a
goddamn sendmail filter or something?

Geee...  Since when are problems "proven" to be NP-hard??  Go back to your
favorite undergrad institution and take a course on computational
complexity again.  Yeah, right.  And you are familiar.

Probelms are not asymptotically Omega(N!) or Omega(N^N).  Solutions are.  I don't believe anyone has ever proved that an NP-hard problem can not be
solved in polynomial time.  Not being able to solve a problem in
polynomial time with current techniques does not make it unsolvable.  MIT
people always surprise me.

LOL.  That was a masterpiece!  Now if you could put all that divine
inspiration and energy into something creative....  :-)
