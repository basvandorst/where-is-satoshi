@_subject: Historical Evidence or Possibility of Steganography in Music 
I was wondering if anyone here might guide me to any reference material
regarding the possibility or actual occurrence of information having been
steganographically hidden in musical scores.
If this is the wrong NG to post this to, please correct me.
