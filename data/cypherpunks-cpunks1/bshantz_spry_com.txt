@_subject: GUCAPI (Grand Unified Crypto API) 
So, you just want a generic overlay (wrapper) to any of the existing encryption algorithms?  Is this correct?
Well, it sounds good in theory.  However, trust me, Todd, writing a generic API that is multi-platfomr is not necessarily as easy as it sounds.  There's alot of code in this prioject.  You would also have to make sure that the API is generic so it could work in ANY program that might use encryption or digital signatures.  (i.e. e-mail, USENET news, possibly even lending itself to a Secure HTTP implementation.)
Uh, just from a first glance, I'd say that this is going to slip gently into the ITAR pits.  There are very few "methods" other than RSAREF that you could use to make this "universal".  Also, would this act as a wrapper over PGP, or would it use the same concepts (and or code) to do the same things?    Agreed, it would be nice to have one API.  As a developer though, I panic when I see "generic" API's.  Usually, they are not as "black-box" as people would like to believe.  What I mean is, usually they are not just as simple as "put in this input, and you will get this output."  Also, are we talking about C code or C++ code?  DOS? Windows?  Are we talking multi-platform code that will work on all the major OS's?  For a generic API, that's alot of code...I keep saying that....must mean something.
I would be interested in seeing something like this implemented, but I question whether it will be a hit as an industry standard.  Generic API's really haven't gone over well for things in the past.  (Except the class libraries for major C++ compilers.  MFC, OWL, etc.)
The design has to be robust before you start coding.  Anyone else have any comments?

@_subject: Legal implications of a PGP DLL 
I know this has been hashed over recently, but I never found out (or don't remember) what was decided in regards to the legal implications of a PGP functional DLL for Windows.  If a company (i.e. SPRY, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.) were to write a PGP DLL and make it publicly available, would that be legal?  Viacrypt just straight out charges too damn much to make it worth licensing.  So, if a company wants to make it's mail client PGP friendly, but not actually supply the encryption algoritm, etc.  Would a DLL be legal if it were in the public domain?

@_subject: McCoy is Right! New Mail Format to Start Now. 
15 years ago, I was a 9 year old in the fifth grade who called the teacher a "nasty" name and was told to write 500 sentences as a reprimand.  I asked if they could be typed, she said yes.  So, I prompt;y went up to the 40 column display on the Apple IIe and wrote a four line, Apple Basic program that would repeatedly print 500 sentences saying, "It is not right to call the teacher names."  When I handed it to her, she new she'd been set up.  That didn't go over well as I remember.
Anyway, that's not really what I wanted to say.  I wanted to say that as a company that writes a Mail package.  One of the biggest complaints of our customers has been lack of MIME support.  Also, we have been severely "wrist slapped" for not formatting our mail messages to 80 characters so "normal people" could read it on their mail readers.  So, my point, the market right now is for MIME support and user setting message widths.  You can't please everyone all the time.
Japanese characters are considerably different.  I've been on some Japanese news servers that you just can't read with a normal news reader just because they require graphical Japanese characters.  (Kanji, Katakana, or Hiragana ... depends on the group.)  By the way, I was testing a news reader, I can't read

@_subject: GUI: PGP vs novices 
Thomas Grant Edwards Writes:
It is my own personal opinion that in order for crypto to truly become mainframe, the software manufacturers of internet connectivity packages must integrate crypto into the applications.  Look at the past threads here on Cypherpunks..."How do I write a script to put PGP into ELM?"  "PGP DLL modularity" etc.
In order to bring crypto to the masses, we have got to convince people that it is necessary.  We also must make it "second nature".  It sure is nice to have a menu option or a toolbar button that will encrypt plaintext automatically.  Key management and some of the "high tech"  (I know, for us it's nothing, but for my dad who just bought a computer and doesn't understand the difference between click, double click, and drag, crypto is a really high tech thing just in itself.) things of crypto should not be directly handled by the user.  (Optional of course.  On a privacy level, the user should have full control.  But give the user a break...if the software is secure..as such...so is the user's privacy.)
You will notice that this message is not signed.  That's because in order to sign it, I would need to save my message, hop out to a DOS box, PGP encrypt it, hop back to my mail program and insert the encrypted mail as a text file.  That's enough to discourage the average user.  This is pretty much what Tim May was talking about when he discussed why he doesn't sign his messages.  It's not that he couldn't... it's just not practical for him.  It's not really practical for me either, but I do it when I feel it's necessary.
The only way to make crypto practical is to basicalloy hide the technical side from the user and make it easy.  That's my two cents.

file.  really Exactly my point Jeff.  Thank you for justifying what I said....**WINK**, In order to even use PGPClip, it involves something OUTSIDE the mail application.  (Although, it does sound intriguing to me.)  Anyway, this is yet another example of the user needing to be fully conscious that they are signing or encrypting.  It should be second nature.  In order for it to become second nature, it MUST be included in the design of the mail package. (Or News reader, or FTP software, whatever.)
Third party utilities make a piece of software harder to use.  That's a given.  Now, don't get me wrong, there are some nice thrid party vendor products out there.  But, I have yet to see a crypto product that merges (cross platform) into a mail package smoothly.
Didn't see any sparks at all, Jeff.  I am interested in PGPClip (at least to look at) does anyone have an FTP site pointer where I could find it?

@_subject: GUI: PGP vs novices 
Good point.  However, the digital signature issue is still outside of what my topic was.  I agree with you wholeheartedly.  That's one of the reasons I don't sign everything.  That particular "argument" about digisigs has been pounded into the ground by the Cypherpunks for the last year and probably I just think (boy I feel repetitive) that there should be something inside the software so the user has the option to sign, or sign on the fly.  If I type up a message and think, "hey, I really want people to know this is from me", It would be really cool to just hit a button on the toolbar, or grab a menu option to sign automatically before sending.  You don't have to sign everything.  But, you don't have to go out to another application (of any sort) in order to sign.  It's right there in front of you.
That was my point.
On a personal machine, say at home, that's not really a problem.  On a computer at the office where everything is password protected, isn't really a problem either.  Since the situations I work with deal mainly with the home user, key management isn't as much a worry as if you're using workstations.
This issue has also been pounded into the ground.  Carrying a disk around with you is really the only way to guarantee security.  (Or memorizing your private key and typing it in every time.  EEEEERRRGGHHHH)  But, you are right.  It is a pain in the ass.

Haven't seen too much discussion of this and how it would affect crypto in general.  Would the FDIV problem cause any problems when looking at large prime numbers?  Actually, let me rephrase that, would it affect determining if a large number is prime?  Floating point errors can be so much fun.
Also, does anyone have the "test" that was floating around the net and in various newspapers a few weeks to see if your machine has the FDIV problem.  I lost the little "post-it note" I had it written on.  Since then, I haven't been able to reproduce it.  (Either the bug went away, or I entered the wrong numbers.  **GRIN**)

The c-punk community could come up with a secure data encryption program
that did not rely on RSAREF, but it would take time.  When you look at the
code for RSAREF, the algorithm really isn't all that bad.  (In fact, IMHO,
it's quite good.)  Several questions that need to be brought up are, "How much
time would it take?"  "How solid is the algorithm",  "Can it be accessible to
the public?"  Also, "Will whatever the c-punk community comes up with
eventually turn into a PGP-like international version control nightmare as is
happening now (Patents, international embargo's, NSA complaints, lack of
backwards compatibility)?"  It is my opinion, that since we do not live in a
perfect world, eventually we'd run into the same problem we have now.  Is it
worth it?
