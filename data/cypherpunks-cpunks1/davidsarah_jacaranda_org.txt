ANNOUNCING Tahoe, the Least-Authority File System, v1.8.1
The Tahoe-LAFS team is pleased to announce the immediate
availability of version 1.8.1 of Tahoe-LAFS, an extremely
reliable distributed storage system. Get it here:
Tahoe-LAFS is the first distributed storage system to offer
"provider-independent security" b meaning that not even the
operators of your storage servers can read or alter your data
without your consent. Here is the one-page explanation of its
unique security and fault-tolerance properties:
The previous stable release of Tahoe-LAFS was v1.8.0, which was
released September 23, 2010 [1].
v1.8.1 is a stable bugfix release correcting a number of minor
issues. It also includes a modest performance improvement in
downloading, and a fix for a security issue involving HTTP
proxies. See the NEWS file [2] for details.
WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?
With Tahoe-LAFS, you distribute your filesystem across
multiple servers, and even if some of the servers fail or are
taken over by an attacker, the entire filesystem continues to
work correctly, and continues to preserve your privacy and
security. You can easily share specific files and directories
with other people.
In addition to the core storage system itself, volunteers
have built other projects on top of Tahoe-LAFS and have
integrated Tahoe-LAFS with existing systems, including
Windows, JavaScript, iPhone, Android, Hadoop, Flume, Django,
Puppet, bzr, mercurial, perforce, duplicity, TiddlyWiki, and
more. See the Related Projects page on the wiki [3].
We believe that strong cryptography, Free and Open Source
Software, erasure coding, and principled engineering practices
make Tahoe-LAFS safer than RAID, removable drive, tape,
on-line backup or cloud storage.
This software is developed under test-driven development, and
there are no known bugs or security flaws which would
compromise confidentiality or data integrity under recommended
use. (For all important issues that we are currently aware of
please see the known_issues.txt file [4].)
This release is compatible with the version 1 series of
Tahoe-LAFS. Clients from this release can write files and
directories in the format used by clients of all versions back
to v1.0 (which was released March 25, 2008). Clients from this
release can read files and directories produced by clients of
all versions since v1.0. Servers from this release can serve
clients of all versions back to v1.0 and clients from this
release can use servers of all versions back to v1.0.
This is the eleventh release in the version 1 series. This
series of Tahoe-LAFS will be actively supported and maintained
for the forseeable future, and future versions of Tahoe-LAFS
will retain the ability to read and write files compatible
with this series.

to provide servers, bandwidth, small personal gifts as tokens
of appreciation, and bug reports.
Google, Inc. sponsored Tahoe-LAFS development as part of the
Google Summer of Code 2010. They awarded four sponsorships to
students from around the world to hack on Tahoe-LAFS that
Thank you to Allmydata and Google for their generous and
public-spirited support.

@_subject: [tahoe-dev] Plans for 1.9.2, 1.10, and 1.11 releases 
Hello Tahoe-LAFS users and hackers!
I'm the release manager for the Tahoe 1.9.2 and 1.10 releases.
Version 1.9.2 will be a bugfix release focussed mainly on fixing
regressions in mutable file support. The mutable publish and retrieve
code was changed extensively in 1.9.0 to support MDMF, and this
unfortunately introduced a few bugs. Several of these have already
been fixed, but the mutable code needs further testing and review to
make sure it is as reliable as possible. There is also an important
regression in immutable upload to be fixed:
1.9.2 will be released from the darcs branch that you can obtain using:
  darcs get --lazy  tahoe-1.9.2
or browse at .
I hope we can release 1.9.2 by the end of May, although that will
depend on how soon we fix the remaining open tickets:
Version 1.10 will include Brian's long-awaited introducer improvements,
using Ed25519-signed announcements, that will be the basis for future
interesting features like multiple introducers and accounting.
It will also include a "move" operation for the web interface and any
other additions that are ready in time for the release, but we won't
wait very long to release it after 1.9.2. It will be released from
git trunk, and we'll probably switch off the darcs-git bridge shortly
The feature set and release schedule of version 1.11 is less certain,
but it could include:
 - improvements to share placement to meet the servers-of-happiness
   criterion in more cases;
 - extending servers-of-happiness to mutable files;
 - some form of accounting;
 - a read-only mode for Tahoe gateways;
 - support for AES+XSalsa encryption (which could in principle be more
   secure against timing attacks than AES alone);
 - a 'tahoe mount' command that simplifies mounting a Tahoe filesystem
   via sshfs;
 - merging the S3 backend support (and possibly other cloud service
   support) developed by Least Authority Enterprises;
 - extending the drop-upload feature to Windows;
 - merging the patches for Tor and I2P into the main release.

@_subject: [tahoe-dev] a few thoughts about the future of leasedb 
Yes, I'm excited :-)
Remember that those share states are needed anyway to avoid race conditions
between adding and removing shares. There are no additional states just to
support marking of potentially inconsistent shares.
Also, clients will need to support non-leasedb servers for a while. (I'm
looking forward to the point where they can drop that support, since it
will allow deleting the rest of the code that implemented renewal secrets.)
There's no *persistent* state needed to do that, since if a server
crashes, its foolscap connections will be dropped and the client will
interpret that as a transaction abort (either immediately or after a
timeout, depending on how clean the crash is). We're assuming that the
leasedb stays consistent while its server is running.
I'm still quite keen on my suggested variation of option 3 on let's call it 3a):
# If [a share that has been added directly to backend storage] is ever
# requested, the server could then notice that it exists and add it to
# the leasedb. In that case, doing a filecheck on that file would be
# sufficient.
I think you didn't want to do that because you thought there would be
a performance advantage in treating the leasedb as authoritative. But
the check for whether a share is on disk when it isn't in the leasedb
is an uncommon case, and does not affect performance in the common
case. (It shouldn't matter if servers take longer to report that they
*don't* have a share, because a downloader should use the first k
servers to respond. Actually, I think the current downloader might be
waiting longer than that, but if so, that is easy to fix.)
A permanent failure is a failure after any retries.
That seems reasonable. Note that if the share is re-stored, it will
overwrite (at least some of) those store objects.
If we do 3a) and a share has a corrupted header, then each time the share
is requested, the server will report that it *does* have the share (because
its objects were listed by the backend query), and then it will fail to
provide it (once it sees that the header is corrupted). That's why I
distinguished the two cases.

@_subject: [tahoe-dev] [tahoe-lafs] #867: use ipv6 
The prefix FC00::/7 (i.e. first byte 0xFC or 0xFD) is reserved for
"unique local addresses" (see and RFC 4193). However, I don't think that the arguments that Greg Troxel put
forward apply to such addresses, in general. It's quite plausible that a
Tahoe-LAFS grid could be made up entirely of nodes that are inter-routable
using FC00::/7 addresses.
