If I had a security clearance and my job was to identify idiots to watch
more closesly, I'd make that image, post it anonymously, over tor, then
see who has an emotional reaction and starts posting a lot of links about
freedom of whatever.
That being said, it's funny in a third-grade sort of humor way, but what
I'd rather see is John Stewart/The Onion/cracked.com intelligent satire.
We can do better than bending over for the NSA and saying 'have at it'
So do better.

Go ahead and post it. I'm not stopping you. I am, however, excercising
my freedom of speech to try to point out that the image you appear to
be defending may be a psy-ops campaign from those who get paid to keep My point is that by promoting that image and the culture(s) it represents
you may be bending over and broadcasting "Here I am, here's how to control
me" to nation-states and email providers that make money based on how many
advertising links you click.

So much for trying to be nice.
Why the fuck are you bending over for people who like to keep secrets?
I like my fucking and my security safe, sane, and consensual. Tor is a
great tool, but too many idiots get caught up in the idea they can use it to 'rage against the machine' by using EXACTLY THE SAME TACTICS THE
MACHINE BENDS THEM THE FUCK OVER WITH.
If you truly wish to fuck the NSA, have no secrets, have no fear, and choose every action as if the world were watching, for they very well may be. If you have something to fear, then hide shit. If you want to be a real cypherpunk, leave the fear and put your life
and integrity to do everything in plain sight and speak truth to power.
Most likely power will leave you the fuck alone because they it figure
out how to manipulate you with fear, and are to afraid of the power of
truth, for which they have no defense.
