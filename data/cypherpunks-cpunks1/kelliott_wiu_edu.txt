It costs money to train an attack dog- kevlar sounds like a good way to
protect the states investment.
Definitely manslaughter, probably 2nd or even 1st degree murder.  In (I
believe) every state the union the penalty for shooting a police dog is the
same as shooting an on duty police officer.  Police dogs are effectively
classified as deputies.
I'm not sure the issue is as simple as you paint it.  You say defending
yourself from an attack dog- however attack dog implies your life was in
danger (if it was it would be comfortably within your rights to shoot the
dog as self defense) inherent in it being a police dog is that it is well
trained and won't kill you (this is in general- I don't know the specifics
of the case and so don't have perfect info on what was going on when he
shot the dog).  Their is also the issue of resisting arrest (I don't know
exactly how he got in that culvert, but I suspect he wasn't enjoying the
scenery) and shooting at the police.  We have to consider shooting at the
dog in the same category as shooting at the police for the same reason
shooting at their car would be in the same category as shooting at the
police.  Regardless we know have a total of 3 crimes that seem to me add up
to jail time regardless of whatever he was originally being chased for.
1. Resisting arrest
2. Shooting at the police
3. Killing the dog (whatever crime you want to classify this as)

This is true in the United States as well.  That's why in every state,
technically speaking, their is no crime of "rape" just varying degrees and
types of "criminal sexual assault".  I'm suprised that hasn't trickled down
to france yet.  Rape is defined as forcing someone to have sexual
intercourse.  It doesn't take much imagination to build an argument that
you can't force a man to have sex, after all he had to get aroused.  The
advantage of criminal sexual assualt is that it side steps these kind of
issues by greatly broadening the crime to basicly forcing/manipulating
someone  to engae in any kind of sexual activity.

agree in principle.
To clarify I presented this as the current likely punishment.
Manslaughter is a legal crime, it does not NECESSARILY mean that one has to
kill a man to be guilty.  This is exactly the same reason that women
cannot, by the meaning of the word, be guilty of rape.  To rape is to
sexually penetrate by use of force.  Women don't have the plumbing.  (see
seperate thread)
So what would you recommend?  Their has to be a substansial punishment for
shooting the dog, otherwise their no reason suspects should not habitually
shoot police dogs if it would increase their chance of escape.  For
comparison purposes does anyone know what the punishment would be for
blowing up a police car?
How was the human treated as an animal?  I think a strong argument can be
made that the dog is serving in the same role (or similar) that a human
would otherwise be in and that is the reason for the harsh punishment.  Not
because you shot a dog but because you shot a "police officer".
Anyone know a place you can get good dog in the US?  In general E.  See comments below.
I think part of this comes back to a sticky issue in the libertarian view-
at what level are people allowed to tell other people they cannot do
certain things in certain places. The federal government should not be
making laws about peoples eating habits.  Neither should the state.
However-  the small community feels that dog eating, cock fighting, etc.
are not things they want to live around.  Do they have the right to say we
don't want those things going on around us?  I think the way the
constitution was originally written made it quite clear that they did.  It
is interesting to note that without the 14th amendment (not added until
after the civil war) their is no prohibition of the state of New Hampshire
declaring that only Catholics can live inside its borders.  If you don't
like it move.  I'm not saying this is what I want to happen but I believe
it is an issue that has not been adequately addressed.  Remember before you
write this idea off who is going to enforce the law saying don't make rules
saying people can't do these things?
My basic view is that regardless of ones personal views about such issues
the government is the wrong medium to enforce them.  If you think eating
meat is wrong convince people to quit eating meat!

I a word, bullshit.  The constitution the way the constitution was phrased
makes it very clear- YOU DO NOT HAVE TO COMMIT A CRIME TO BE GUILTY OF
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES!!! Many people have been impeached in Americas history
and most were not guilty of a crime, ie their offenses were not legal
crimes or they were never prosecuted for the crime they were impeached and
tried for.  Fact- the president has commited perjury.  That is undeniable,
Starr has presented his evidence very clearly and I don't think that needs
to be rehashed.  Are his actions sufficient to yield a criminal conviction
in the "real world"?  In a general sense yes but in a broader sense that is
completely irrelevant to the question at had.  A parking ticket is
suffiecent to qualify as an impeachable offense under the constitution
("high crimes and MISDEMEANORS) but again that isn't relevant.  For the
sake of argument I will through out all criminal conduct, all perjury
issues, obstruction of justice, possible sexual assault, everything.  What
we are left with is a president who engaged in gross sexual misconduct with
a women under his employment.  That is ethical misconduct of the most
aggregious kind.  It undermines authority, disturbs professional atmosphere
necessary for a smoothly functioning organization.  In any corporation in
America it would, by custom and, in some jurisdictions, law, be grounds for
immediate dismissal.  Impeachment is exactly that.  It imposes no
punishments, no jail time, no fines, it simply removes an official from the
position he has failed to faithfully execute.

The problem with act utilitarianism is that in whatever form it takes it leaves itself much to open to the problems of personal view point. Hitler felt himself completely justified in murdering all the jews because he felt they were causing an enormous amount of pain to the rest of the population. He would have been justified under your framework IF it could be shown they were causing sufficient pain, although that would necessarily be enormous amount of pain.
This is a problem with any formulation of act utilitarianism.  Any formulation of act utilitarianism inherently falls victim to a set of extreme circumstances that result in outcomes which are clearly immoral (see the Hitler example above for a counter example).

The reason is that MORE THAN HALF of the US budget goes to SOCIAL SECURITY which is considered "nondiscressionary*.

They are being asked to fight what amount to repeated wars with zero increase in there budget, a budget primarily designed for training and maintenance of equipment, the mass moves and long term actions they are being required to do.

Oh yeah, now things get interesting.  The issue of allowing such things in your newspaper is a problem you have with your newspaper, not them.  If you don't like what your newspaper publishes complain to it, not to NAMBLA.  The ISP issue is similar.  I don't have a problem with an organization controlling the material it carries, BUT I have a serious problem with organizations-
A. Not making the fact they do such things VERY clear in their user agreement, etc.
B. Changing said agreement depending on which way the wind blows.
Their is also a legal issue here that is worth mentioning.  An ISP deciding to censor/filter traffic based on content potentially opens that ISP to serious legal risk.  As long as an ISP acts as a simple bit shuffler their liability for user activity is tiny.  They enjoy the same status as the telephone company (that of a common carrier) and thus have no responsibility for the traffic they carry.  The moment the step over that line and begin to monitor said traffic they can no longer claim to be a common carrier.  I believe their was an interesting case several years ago where an ISP in the Eastern US was held liable for pornographic material stored on one of there news servers, specifically because they had taken action in the past to remove such material.
Regardless however, all such activities to restrict traffic ought to be done by contacting the individuals and/or organizations responsible (either carriers or originators), not by running to big momma government and whining about how such talk disturbs you.  Using the government and specifically the judiciary as a big cudgel to beat people who's opinion you disagree with into submission is morally reprehensible.  People who abuse government in such a way ought to be shunned with the same venom typically reserved for pedophiles and persons of similar ilk.

It begins here and is extended by the 14th.  A judges job is to apply the law to the case presented to him.  For all federal judges (and today state judges) the law is a stack of rulings by other courts and laws based by legislative bodies.
For a federal court the stack is
The Constitution.
The accumulated federal statues
Case law
For state courts we have
The Constitution (per the 14th)
State Law
Case law
Any layer can be overridden by the layer above it, so state and federal judges are expected to take all layers into account to minimize the number of rulings that have to overturned on appeal.  It is also expected that lower courts take a more strict view of the law than appellate courts as the appellate courts job is to rule on points of law while the lower court is a primarily a finder of fact with ruling on law a secondary role (the difference between appellate and original jurisdiction).

However, in practice I can think of no situation where this could occur- civil law (the primary area where common law rules) simply does not involve anything the constitution says anything about.

That sounds to me like they we're basicly satisfied with the rest of english common law...
This brought to mind another interesting question.  When examining this amendment is the $20 in 1700's coinage or in current dollars? How much would that $20 be worth today anyway?

That's not really what I'm trying to say.  The question is, is it possible for a ruling to be valid under common law and invalid under the constitution.  I think the answer is no and the reason (as you may have been trying to say) is that the constitution is a part of common law, and all decisions since it's creation have, by definition, been either constitutional or overruled on appeal.

Tsk, tsk Tim.  In a free society people are also free to send those writers letters warning them of inaccuracies in there article (including the headlines).  AND the newsperson is well advised to correct such in things when they are in fact they are untrue. Failure to do so can and should result in a libel suit.  Such is the way things should work in a free society...

Can you not read?
" No state shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty of"
_without the consent of congress_
Hint- the state's have congresses consent.

The point is though, that according to C99 today
volatile int myflag;
if (myflag!=0) { do stuff } ;
does _exactly_ what you want, per the spec.  The only compilers that don't work this way are by definition out of spec, so adding new stuff isn't going to help.
Having said that, most of what your talking about pragma wise is boils down to controlling the optimizer.  Most compilers offer options to control this, but it's vendor specific.  I can see how adding this to the spec would be worthwhile.  But it's not essential to fix the problem above.

I always knew New York was full of commie bastards.  I thought they were smart enough to hide themselves behind good capitalist weapons. Like an AR-15 or an MP-5.  3

I have found that the administrative costs of PKI are
intolerable. End users do not really understand crypto, and so
will fuck up. Only engineers can really control a PKI
certificate, and for the most part they just do not.
In principle the thingness of a smartcard should reduce
administrative costs to a low level -- they should supposedly
act like a purse, a key, a credit card, hence near zero user
training required.  The simulated thingness created by
cryptographic cleverness should be manifested to the user as
physical thingness of the card.
Suppose, for example, we had working Chaumian digicash.  Now
imagine how much trouble the average end user is going to get
into with backups, and with moving digicash from one computer
to another.  If all unused Chaumian tokens live in a smartcard,
one might expect the problem to vanish.  The purselike
character of the card sustains the coin like character of
Chaumian tokens.
Of course if one has to supply the correct driver for the smart
card, then the administration problem reappears.
USB smartcard interfaces could solve this problem.   Just plug
them in, and bingo, it should just go.  Ummh, wait a moment, go
where, do what?  What happens when one plugs in a USB smartcard
Still, making crypto embodied in smart cards intelligible to
the masses would seem to be a soluble problem, even if not yet
solved, whereas software only crypto is always going to boggle
the masses.

Hey don't forget you can still buy a smart card reader from that most

Yes/no.  When your not logged in your home folder is stored as an encrypted DiskImage.  In addition part of enabling FileVault was a complete rework of how login authentication was handled, part of which included removing the 8 char limitation.  For the record, apple has always allowed passwords longer than 8 char, prior to 10.3, however, only the first 8 char were used to log you in, though the other characters were used to unlock your keychain.
No they are not.  Apple considers DiskImages to be a proprietary competitive advantage.
It is a virtual certainty that Apple used Security.framework which includes a variety of algorithms (including AES) and secure/peer reviewed operation modes.  I believe the security framework is open source, and in fact based on a broader standard (CDSA).  If you'd like to know for certain I'd suggest you email dts at apple.com and/or file a bug report at bugreporter.apple.com (requires free registration) on the documentation.
