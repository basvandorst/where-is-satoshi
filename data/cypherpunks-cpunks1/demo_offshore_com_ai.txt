@_subject: Rumors of death of Anguilla Data are greatly exagerated. 
In taxhaven industry jargon, "clean" means they are avoiding taxes only. No drugs, no money laundering, no violent crime, no stolen money, no
fraud. Many fortune 500 companies have offshore corporations for "self
insurance".  Many many movies have corporations offshore just for that
movie.  These are type of "clean" corporations that taxhavens like.    --  Vince

@_subject: TWA 800 - hit by an unarmed US missile? 
Not saying they aren't; however, I don't recall seeing CNN or any of the
networks saying if the Navy really was firing missiles or not.  Have they?
Never seen anyone ask questions about US firing missiles (have seen them
ask if it was a missile or a bomb). I don't get any US newspapers here in
Anguilla, so my impression of the US press is really just from TV. Is the press on top of this?

@_subject: Cypherpunks moderator robot 
Lucky Green:
The cypherpunks moderator robot should check PGP signatures for the
"preapproved posters" - it is just too easy to forge email.  And the human
moderator should be willing to put any regular posters onto the list of
"preapproved posters".  Any preapproved who mutated into a flamer would be
removed from the list.  Newbies would have to be around for a bit to get
on. Should work well enough.

@_subject: New York Times report on FC97 
I am told the vast majority of people don't even have phones there.  One
of the x-pats here checked it out before moving to Anguilla.    -- Vince
