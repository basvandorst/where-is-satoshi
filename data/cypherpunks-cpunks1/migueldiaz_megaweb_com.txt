@_subject: `Hack Microsoft' challenge is NYT Computer News Daily's top story 
I don't know about everyone else, but a T-shirt seems a very small reward for uncovering a "hole" in the encryption algorithm of Microsoft products.  Does that apply to any and all bugs?? i.e. not necessarily security problems??

There are many ways to test for randomness. you might want to start by accumulating instance of "1" and "0" and over a long time you should have roughly an equal number of both.  If you have access to a spectrum analyzer with an auto-correlation function (or cross-correlation will do) feed in similar lengths of output at different time intervals and check to ensure a low (close to zero) correlation exists.  Also while you are at it you might want to checks the ouput's frequency spectrum, it should be fairly uniform accross the generating range.  Noise (or randomness) which is not normally distributed can lead to nasty hacks.
Be Well!!

If it means protection only when using a proprietary product owned by Microsoft then no, I still don't see it as much of a reward.  If we are talking a system which can be used by everyone at no cost, then yes that would be motivating.

Dr. Frederick B. Cohen writes in part:
Ditto.  The next major hack of Netscape will likely be used to bring that company to its knees. Unless one assumes that obvious backdoors will still be unprotected by their new code, a lot of computing time for brute force attacks and algorithm development will have to be spent to properly crack Netscape again. I seriously doubt the successful individuals will merely settle for fame and not fortune this time around.
OTOH I would much rather see MS get hacked next. If the rumors, which are piling now, on MS being a Peeping Tom when it comes to hard drives are true, I wonder if there might be a way to send a byte bomb to their bit bucket??.......

@_subject: Seeds which depend on machine states 
It is my suspicion that seeds which depend on machine states(ie state of your computer at a specific instance of time) would always be subject to scrutiny and de-cryption.
As long as the software used to encrypt is not self-modifying, the machine state can (through careful manipulation involving temperature, clocks, processes etc)always be replicated and fixed to an acceptable degree.
This allows you to look into the heart of the encryption method and then create a plan to decode based on a brute-force attack.  Time is the only friend then of the encryptor and unfortunately in the case of credit cards this typically is measured in years. Plenty of time for brute force attacks to yield fruit.  I'll be gone for two days. will respond to any comments Saturday.
