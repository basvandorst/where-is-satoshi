Privacy Expert Says Democracy Demands "Responsible"
Privacy Protections
Glee Harrah Cady of Privada, Inc. Says Innovative
Technology That Empowers Consumers Is Better Than
Regulation In Solving Privacy Concerns WASHINGTON, D.C. � September 14, 2000 � An executive
from one of America's leading privacy technology
companies warned those attending a summit here that
efforts to create a one-size-fits-all law protecting
privacy will never be as effective as the solutions
offered by ongoing technological innovation. "Privacy is fundamental to any democracy," said Glee
Harrah Cady, Vice President of Global Public Policy
for the San Jose-based Privada, Inc. "People must be
able to fully express their opinions and thoughts
without fear. Anonymity can be important to the
democratic process, but it also can be abused." Cady pointed to recent incidents of hacking and the
spread of computer viruses as circumstances in which
anonymity does not serve the public good. "Privacy is
a right until you misuse it," she told participants at
the Global Privacy Summit. Obviously AMEX & Privada don't have a clue as to the
history of privacy and privacy tools...
What about civil john doe complaints?
What about Church of $cientology and Penet.fi?
What about the entire key escrow debate?
What about the entire clipper debate?
If anyone really things that 'identity escrow' enabled
privacy products are what the market is looking for,
they are seriously clueless.
This is obviously snake oil.
