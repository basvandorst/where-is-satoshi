@_subject: What is a cypherpunk? 
"Cypherpunks generally distrust the collectivist wisdom ..."
Yes, but Big Brother governments are not the only way such "wisdom"
gets imposed.  Bill Gates came close to imposing it upon all of us,
and if it hadn't been for Richard Stallman and Linus Torvalds, we
might all be suffering under that yoke today.
The genius of Bill Gates is in knowing that most people don't notice
or care that to agree to a EULA is to make a vow of ignorance, and not
being ashamed to stoop to their level.
The true danger of TCPA is not that "free" MP3s and movies will become
unavailable, but the de facto loss of privacy as non-TCPA gear becomes
unavailable or prohibitively expensive.
