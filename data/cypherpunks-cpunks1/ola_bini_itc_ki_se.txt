Hash: SHA1
Email is more or less like sending a post card. Anyone inbetween can take a peek if they have the knowledge. (And not much knowledge is required). This is why cryptgraphic signing and encryption is preferable to communicate through EMail. So the answer to your question is: Always assume someone has looked at it.

Well, they could just tune in on Echelon, which really seems to be reality. There is no need for "infinite" resources to do such a thing.
Here is the fundamental misunderstanding. Your email is no "account". There are no place where your account is stored. The only thing that exists is an endpoint, where you receive your mail. Before the mail reaches that point, its's just TCP-packets on the wire. If the listener is on a mail router, you could possibly see a trace of it in the message header, but it's possible to rewrite that stuff to, so the only way to KNOW if someone reads your mail is to analyze the potential readers behaviour based on the information in your mail.

That's completely unwarranted for. The end point for hotmail is Microsoft's hotmail-servers, and for gmail the endpoint is Google's servers. Stop being so damned rabid.
