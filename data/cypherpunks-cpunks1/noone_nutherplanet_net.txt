WASHINGTON ï¿½ï¿½ The Justice Department obtained
by subpoena the home telephone records of an Associated Press reporter for
a period in which he wrote about the investigation of Sen. Robert Torricelli,
the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan has disclosed. In an Aug. 20 letter,
the office of U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the government subpoenaed telephone
records of John Solomon for incoming and outgoing calls at the reporter's home
from May 2 to May 7. White was appointed last spring to oversee the Torricelli
investigation. Justice Department spokeswoman Susan Dryden declined to comment
on the matter Monday. On May 4, an AP story under Solomon's byline quoted
unidentified law enforcement officials as saying Torricelli had been recorded
on a wiretap in 1996 discussing fund-raising with relatives of a prominent
Chicago crime figure. Law enforcement officials can face criminal penalties
for disclosing information obtained under federal wiretaps. The unidentified
officials told the AP that the intercepted call received new scrutiny two years
later when allegations surfaced of thousands of dollars in illegal straw donations
to Torricelli's campaign. According to the AP story, the law enforcement officials
said several people have been questioned about the intercept and whether Torricelli
or his staff ever encouraged them to disguise donations. "We are outraged
by what the Justice Department has done and we will seek any available legal
redress," said AP President and CEO Louis D. Boccardi. "Their actions fly
in the face of long-standing policy that recognizes what a serious step it
is to go after a reporter's phone records. We hope that this secret assault
on the press is not an indication of the Bush administration's attitude toward
a press free of government interference," Boccardi said. First Amendment
lawyer Floyd Abrams said a Justice Department subpoena of a journalist's telephone
records was extremely rare. "I cannot say that every time the government
seeks to obtain telephone records of journalists it necessarily violates the
First Amendment, but there's no doubt that the decision of the government to
go so far as to obtain these telephone records raises constitutional questions
of a high order of delicacy," Abrams said. Deputy Attorney General Larry
Thompson approved the subpoena for the reporter's records, according to the
letter mailed to Solomon. Attorney General John Ashcroft disqualified himself
from the matter. Torricelli campaigned last year for Ashcroft's Democratic
opponent in the U.S. Senate race in Missouri. Ashcroft lost to Jean Carnahan,
who stepped in after her husband was killed in a plane crash. 2001 The Associated P

Gruesome (anti cult) photo display turns spotlight back on Falun Gong By John Schauble, Herald Correspondent in Beijing "We have won a great victory in struggling against Falun Gong, but this cult will not be reconciled to its defeat," a solemn Mr Li said.

'We're Appalled by Beijing's Oppression Against the Falun Gong. It's
The Same Radical Position They Hold Against Christians, Buddhists And
Hindus,' said Bob Maginnis, FRC's Vice President of Policy
WASHINGTON, July 19 /PRNewswire/ -- In the past month more than 260
men, women and children have been tortured to death in Chinese
prisons, for their religious beliefs. Tens of millions of people in
China are still at risk, in a country with an egregious human rights
record, perhaps the worst in the world. ``Unfortunately, a government with such an appalling human rights
record has just received the crown jewel of world sporting events, the
2008 Olympics. At the same time, the U.S. Congress may soon rubber
stamp the renewal of ''permanent`` normal trade relations with China.
The Chinese communist government harasses, imprisons and tortures
people because of their faith. The communists are trying to replace
the teachings of Christ with that of Mao. Government run Christian seminaries replace Bible study with communist
party religious policy,'' said Maginnis. On Thursday, July 19, more than 3,000 people are expected to attend a
commemorative rally at the U.S. Capitol (Lower West Terrace, Noon-2
p.m.), to call for an immediate end to the abuses. Speakers include
FRC's Vice President of Policy, Bob Maginnis, several members of
Congress and leaders of various human rights organizations. Horrifying stories are being reported on a daily basis. Female
prisoners are stripped and beaten with bamboo sticks and their
genitals are shocked with electric batons. Many are gang raped by male
prisoners and guards. A few weeks ago, a Falun Gong practitioner was
burned alive. Last year, a mother and her 8-month son were hung upside
down by handcuffs, before their skulls were crushed to death. Others
have been tied to cars and dragged to their deaths. ``We need to
demand that Beijing stop its brutal repression of religious believers
before they are welcomed into the world of nations by countries that
respect human rights.'' SOURCE: Family Research Council
