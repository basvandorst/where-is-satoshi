remains unresolved, said an embassy official, speaking on condition of
Goodness!  You mean the US is stuck with only embassy staff, no "Peace

@_subject: Polio, DES Crack, and Proofs of Concept 
In the most recent _Science_ some biologists gripe that the scientists
who synthesized infectious
poliovirus from its description were not doing anything novel, just a
"prank".  Any biologist
would have known that, since you could concatenate nucleotide strings,
and since polio needs nothing
besides DNA (eg no enzymes) to be infectious, obviously you can synth
This is *remarkably* similar to cognescenti reactions to the DES Crack
project.  Yes, it was
obvious it would work, and it was largely unnecessary (from a
security-planning perspective)
to actually do it.  But it was proof-of-concept.  Like synthesizing

There is an article on the Denver Police/STASI  files at:
Folks were in the database for bumperstickers.
That will be very amusing when all the crime-DB are integrated and used
to harass people in airports,
buses & trains, street checkpoints, and when the crowd-face-scanners

Some authorities just need reformatting.
