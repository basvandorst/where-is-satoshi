Judges-L Registrar,
Welcome to Judges-L
The following Frequently Asked Questions with answers are designed to assist you in interacting with other subscribers to the Judges' List and thereby assist users of the NetNews system in dealing with certain types of abusive messages. Please do not post to the List until you have been a subscriber for a couple of weeks, so you can avoid the most common mistakes made by new subscribers. Alternatively you can review the activities of the List by retrieving archives of recent discussions. You can retrieve the list of archives by sending "INDEX  Judge-L" (not including quotation marks)  to LISTSERV at UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU (or LISTSERV at UBVM.BITNET).  You can then  order these files with a "GET Judge-L  LOGxxxx". For example, to get the first month's archive, send the command "GET JUDGES-L  LOG9409" to retrieve the archive for September of 1994. You can unsubscribe by sending the command "UNSUB JUDGES-L" in the body of a message to LISTSERV at UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU (or LISTSERV at UBVM.BITNET).
Please retain this message for future reference.
