@_subject: Markoff/NYTimes : "Big Brother & the Computer Age" 
Since I haven't seen any mention of this yet:
On the D1 (business section) page, in the top center, in today's [May
6] New York Times, is a diagram and 38" story on issues re: Clipper.
Given that it's a finals week, I don't have time to enter much from
the article, but will note the following:
The first two paragraphs:
disclosed plan by the Clinton Administration to secure the privacy of
the nation's phone calls and computer data with a standard set of
computer codes.
The first quotation (and the only one appearing on D1) in the article
is from Eric Hughes:
warned," said Eric Hughes, an independent software designer in
Berkeley, Calif.
