@_subject: AT&T Encrypting Phone Ad in WS Journal 
The Wall Street Journal, 7 June 93, page B7, has an AT&T ad for an
encrypting communications box called "Surity Telephone Device".
It plugs between a regular phone and the phone jack.
Anybody know what's inside?  Is this new?  Also, page B6 has a so-so article on digital signatures.

@_subject: e$ & Reporting Cash Trans 
Wall Street Journal, perhaps April '94?  I think it was a
high-level court ruling that essentially said it's perfectly
ok to intentionally structure cash transfers to avoid the $10,000 reporting requirement.  That's all I recall.
