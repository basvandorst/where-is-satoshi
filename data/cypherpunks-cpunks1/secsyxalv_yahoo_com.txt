@_subject: What is reverse Mortgage? 
Reverse Mortgage is a loan against your home that you do not have to pay back for as long as you live there. With a reverse mortgage, you can turn the value of your home into cash without having to move or to repay the loan each month.
To be eligible for reverse mortgage, you must own your home and be 62 years of age or older. Kids Apply now for your parents and get all of the facts.
