I'm trying to find/predict the next  stock to pop.  What do you guys think about DMHN? I just bought a little bit on Friday and it is up   +0.10 (100.00%) Monday Oct 22nd. I wish I would have gotten more.  Oh well, I was lucky enough to getDMHN at .10 I've been looking at DMHN quite a bit and think I will still jump in because I think its going to .50
Good luck to you all. Company: DYNAMIC MEDIA HOLDIN Symbol:(Other OTC:DMHN.PK) Price at Noon est; .20 up 100%
