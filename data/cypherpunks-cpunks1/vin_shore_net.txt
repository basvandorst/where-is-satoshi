@_subject: Australian "calculatorcard" 
Cees de Groot (cg at bofh.toad.com) tore himself from the tube to tell us:
CG> Yesterday, on UK Discovery, there was an item in the programme
CG> Beyond 2000 about an Australian card which implements a
CG> challenge-response protocol and can be used for banking, etcetera.
CG> Basically, you give your card number (over the phone), get a
CG> challenge number, enter your pin and the challenge, and then give the
CG> response. All in CC format...
        Could be one of seven or 8 vendors of so-called
"challenge/response" tokens or calculators.  Most of those sold in the US
and Australia use straight DES (and a token-specific key) to encrypt the
"random" challenge number in the token -- but it could be any secret-key
        Actually, the particular environment described -- phone
authentication -- is often used as the most notable example of a market
where so-called "time-synchonous" tokens hold a  notable advantage over
challenge/response token. A TS token generates its pseudo-random
token-codes continuously and automatically: no buttons, no input.
        With TS tokens, exact time and a token-specific key are used in a
keyed hash to generate a token-code displayed on an LCD on the token for 30
or 60 seconds.   The authentication server uses its database record of the
token-specific key, time, and the hash to generate the same token-code for
a match.  This allows a PIN and token-code two-factor authentication to be
submitted by touch-tone phone, and it avoids a lot of the hassle
(listen/tap/calculate/touch-tone) associated with C/R authentication.
        As amp  noted, the most prominent
international vendor of time-synch tokens is a US firm called Security
Dynamics, Inc.  I've done consulting projects for SDI, off and on, for
        SDI's token is called a SecurID.   SDI uses
a  proprietary hash.  The most common app uses a SecurID in a
protocol which prepends the PIN, in the clear, to the PRN token-code. (In
client/server environments, of course, all communication between an SDI
ACE/Client and the ACE/Server is fully encrypted.)  SecurIDs can also be
loaded with up to three different seeds or keys -- with a pressure-point in
one corner to switch between each series of key-based PRNs.
        For greater security in open networks, SDI sells a PinPad token
with a keypad that allows a PIN to be "added" to the PRN token-code -- so
the LCD displays a 6-8 digit number (or alphanumeric) which still offers
two-factor authentication, without exposing a PIN.
        Actually, all ACE/Server or ACE software modules _require_ a
user-memorized PIN.  Physical possession of a stolen token is not enough to
gain illicit access.
        Bleep!  Earth to amp! Check your voltage, lately?  The token's
serial number has nothing whatsoever to do with the generation of a
SecurID's PRN token-code.
        Just because SDI ships its SecurIDs pre-loaded (most token vendors
ask the buyers to program their authentication tokens) SDI embosses a
serial number on the back of the token to manage shipping and distribution.
The serial number stuck to the back of a SecurID after it is programmed
with its secret key -- a unique PRN "significantly longer" than 56 bits --
but they are not the same thing.  The cpu in a SecurID doesn't even "know"
the serial number stuck on the back of the token.
        (It would be Pretty Stupid  to glue or emboss a secret on the
back of the damn token, wouldn't it?)  I should note that Alan is just
regergitating one of the most widely circulated  rumors about SecurIDs --
which like any popular crypto device attracts a lot of wiLd & w00ly
        Getting the algorithm for SDI's one-way hash is no big deal, given
that it sits in software in thousands of SDI customer installations,
protected only by contract and trade secret status.  (The integrity of the
product -- the unpredictability of the token-code PRN series, and the
secrecy of a specific token's seed or key -- rightly depends cryptographic
strength of the hash, not the secrecy of the algorithm.)  Getting a
token-specific secret key would hopefully be a much greater challenge.
CG> Can anybody provide me with pointers to more in-depth information
CG> about this device and the algorithm(s) behind it ?
        Suerte & Happy New Year to all,
                                                                 _Vin

Heed, fellow citizens, Justice Felix Frankfurter (Butler v. Michigan):
       "The State insists that, by thus quarantining the general reading public
against books not too rugged for grown men and women in order to shield
juvenile innocence, it is exercising its power to promote the general
welfare. Surely this is to burn the house to roast the pig.... The incidence
of this enactment is to reduce the adult population of Michigan to reading
only what is fit for children."

@_subject: SecurIDs (was Re: Australian "calculatorcard") 
amp  described his SecurID:
        David Lesher  asked:
        SDI's ACE/Server or ACE access control module (ACM) has a Progress
RDBS built in which maintains a constantly-updated historical record of the
_relative_ drift in a particular token's clock-chip, relative to the clock
in the server or host.  When it receives the first identifier from a user
(Name) submitting a SecurID authentication call, the server checks the
database for the recorded drift and then predicts what that particular
token will use as Current Time.  CT, together with a token-specific secret
key, is then hashed to generate a token-code which is matched with that
submitted by the user,  together with the user's memorized PIN.
        You have it almost exactly right (or, at least, that's how SDI's
ACE/SecurID system handles it;-) SDI throws in a couple other factors:  the
ACE system handles Current Time in 30 or 60-second blocks (depending on the
model of SecurID token being authenticated,) so it needs a little leeway to
handle a token which, because of drift, slips into the next time-slot or
the one behind.
        The ACE system actually pre-calculates three token-codes -- each a
pseudo-random number, so one will not inform your guess of another -- as it
waits for a user's incoming authentication call to be completed.  The
server will approve access if it receives a token code generated from
either its _projected_ Current Time (for this particular token,) or the
token-codes generated from Current Time plus or minus one time-slot.
        When the ACE database indicates that this particular SecurID token
has not been used in the past 60 days (many sysadmin make this 90 days) it
also kicks in a search mode to minimize the false rejections.  In search
mode it calculates a series of prospective card-codes, sweeping out to a
maximum of 10 time-slots (the actual scope of the search is defined by the
sysadmin) fore and aft of whatever the database suggests this token should
consider Current Time.  If it finds a match between the token-code
submitted from a long-unused SecurID and one of those calculated by the
server in search mode, it updates its database projection for the drift of
that particular token and then requests the use to submit another PRN
token-code.  A search-mode "match" alone will never result in a user being
authenticated -- it only sets him or her up for a second formal
authentication cycle where a new PRN card-code is matched against a new set
of three token-codes.
        There are also a number of additional security devices and rules
which the server enforces to protect against security threats, racing
spoofs, stolen PINs, stolen tokens, etc.  The most obvious is a secured
record of all incoming authentication calls, recorded by token-code and GMT
time.  All incoming authentication calls are checked against this file. A
SecurID PRN token-code is never accepted twice, and the virtual
"time-stamp" within an incoming SecurID token-code must always be later and
in proper sequence to all other recorded authentication calls.
        If the SDI hash algorithm is of sufficient strength, very little, I
would think.
        (SDI just asked me to create an FAQ for their SecurID, so all
queries are welcome -- on-line or off.)
        Suerte,

@_subject: RSA & SDI 
Steve Reid  exclaimed:
        I know a lot about SDI's technology and history.  (Under contract
to SDI, I just finished writing a draft FAQ on their ACE/SecurID user
authenication system.  It's unofficial and in-process, but I'm willing to
e-mail the SecurID FAQ to anyone willing to read it and give me comments,
criticism, and suggestions on how to improve it.  Fair warning: it is
20,000+ words and written to educate a lay audience.)
        I haven't heard anything yet about SDI's position on RSA licences;
but I doubt if there will be any surprises in that area soon. Among people
associated with either company, it has been common knowledge that SDI and
RSA folk have been very close for years, on both personal and professional
levels.  RSA's technical expertise has been apparent in SDI's user
authentication system at several levels (albiet undocumented) and SDI's
marketing expertise has doubtless informed RSA's policies in recent years.
        SDI, with over 150 salesmen on the street, fields the largest and
most successful sales force selling Computer Security.  SDI's SecurIDs
tokens dominate the large-site (<1,500 tokens) corporate market for user
authentication tokens with an estimated 70-80 percent of the market --
largely on the basis of the relative ease-of-use of the SecurID over its
challenge/response competitors; SDI's early committment to client/server
environments; and SDI's corporate promise to evolve to meet the changing
CompSec threat.
        A SecurID generates the token's 4-8 digit token-code from an
SDI-proprietary hash that puts Current Time and a token-specific key
through a one-way function to create a PRN that changes every 30 or 60
seconds.  All SecurID authentication calls also require two-factor
validation; both the token-code and a user-memorized PIN must be submitted
to the ACE/Sever for validation.
        There has never been any doubt -- given the evolving risks and the
needs of on-line business community -- that SDI would eventually sell both
authentication and encryption services.  (It has also been obvious for
years that SDI had, in its SecurID token-code, a neat symmetrical
encryption key-generator already in widespread use in many networked
environments.  SDI had a mocked-up system that effectively used a SecurID
token to generate DES keys seven or eight years ago, as I recall -- but
apparently SDI never felt the market opportunities were sufficient to lure
them into the political malestrom around crypto... until now.)
         I have no secrets to share, but it would surprise me if many SDI
customers don't read a major opportunity for themselves in SDI's purchase
of RSA.  Last fall, SDI upgraded its ACE/Server to a new version (2.X)
which manages user records on a fully-integrated Progress relational
database.  This integration of a SQL and 4GL-accessible RDBS brought a
whole new level of functionality, complexity, and opportunity into ACE
system administration -- but it also offers the security, scalability, and
RDBS-to-RDBS communication options necessary to manage enterprise-wide IS
security systems.
        Managing a large key-management system through a flat text database
would be a nightmare.  With the flexibility of an indexed RDBS, it becomes
feasible to look to SDI's ACE/Server as a vehicle to hold and manage crypto
keys, either PKC pairs or symmetrical keys, for an enterprise-wide system
with multiple and distributed sysadmin sites.  Some ACE/Server systems now
support over 20,000 SecurID users, and the ESQL comm options will finally
open the door to integrated multiple-server environments.
        I have no answer on that one, but the marrage of RSA's technology
and SDI's marketing muscle -- given RSA's credibility and SDI's installed
base in commercial MIS sites -- unveils a world of interesting
        One interesting thought: since SDI has a shoe-leather sales force
on the street in 20-odd nations, SDI (with RSA) might be able to leverage
an integrated crypto/authentication technology and sell in markets where
RSA's algorithms doesn't even enjoy patent protection.  In the best of
commercial traditions, SDI would be selling a solution rather than a
        Suerte,

@_subject: F2 hash? 
.
         J�ri Kaljundi  noted that "Mudge," a fabled hacker
long associated with the elite clique "Cult of the Dead Cow," (honest!) had
been scheduled to speak on SecurID vulnerabilities at DefCon in Vegas two
weeks ago.
        Adam Shostack  primed the pump:
        Yup.  SDTI asked me and their Principal Engineer, John Brainard, to
wallow in the delights of Vegas and attend Mudge's scheduled speech at the
DefCon hackers' convention.
        Not knowing that half of the people over 30 attending DefCon would
be FBI agents (not undercover; wearing FBI/DefCon IV-embazoned polo shirts,
and passing out _lots_ of G-man recruiting literature! No kidding!) the
Powers That Be at SDTI selected John and I,  from the girded ranks of their
employees and sundry consultants, as either the least likely to squander
our personal fortunes at craps, or the most likely to fit in among the
(little)bit-perverted odd-balls who gather at DefCons.
        I refuse to speculate as to which (but I think I've finally got the
knack of card-counting at blackjack;-)
       As Cerridwyn Llewyellyn  reported, Mudge --
posed and celebrated on page 40-something of last month's WiRed -- told the
DefCon audience that SDTI's lawyers were after him, threatening something
dire, so he was not going to release his "white paper" on weaknesses in the
ACE/SecurID system for several months.  Instead, he delivered a talk on
s/key vulnerabilities.
        This was weird, because I *knew* Security Dynamics had neither
consulted nor asked their lawyers to do anything about Mudge's speech on
SecurID vulnerabilities.  It would have been a fool's ploy: silly and
        John and I took Mudge out for dinner right after that speech. He
told us then that he had inadvertently misspoken when he blamed his
temporary silence on SDTI's lawyers. The real problem, he said, was with
bullying lawyers from two corporate clients he is now under contract to in
his day job.
        (He didn't explain this further, but I understood that Mudge is
working for two firms which have access to SDTI plans and trade secrets
under non-disclosure agreements.  The firms were apparently worried about
their liability -- given their promises to SDTI and Mudge's work in their
employ.  Mudge may want to elaborate on this.  Or not.)
        Mudge is a very sharp guy; a hacker in the old sense of a system
maven -- despite his beer-swillin' Dead Cow Cult role-playing.  Off stage,
he spoke freely about which attack vectors he's been working on, but
offered limited detail.  (My impression was that when the
conflict-of-interest stuff came up, Mudge put aside his analysis of SecurID
authentication for awhile... but intends to work on it further, once free
of other obligations.)  He and SDTI's John Brainard got along well,
nattering to each other in machine code (which another DefCon luminary who
joined us, *Hobbit*, would ocassionally translate for me.)
        Mudge is deeply involved in analyzing the ACE client/server code
for weakness; he too is also very interested in the F2 algorithm -- which
he felt involves too much knowable information as input to the hash -- and,
of course (like Shimomura, the self-styled Threat of the West,) Mudge is
stolidly pounding away at the SecurID itself to retrieve and cryptoanalyze
the algorithm that hashes Current Time and the token's secret key to
generate a SecurID token-code.
        John Brainard -- who wrote the SecurID hash ten years ago -- openly
admired Mudge's ingenuity but didn't seem to feel particularly threatened.
        Mudge and John also talked about various potential high-level
protocol attacks on the network infrastructure and how they could possibly
be used to isolate a Master ACE/Server from a (backup) Slave -- with an
attacker able to both sniff incoming traffic to the Master and replay it to
the Slave (after the Slave had been artificially trapped on an isolated
subnet by the attacker.)  The discussion was out of my league, but I
enjoyed watching the vollying back and forth.
        The whole exchange was fun and reminded me of the healthy
relationship hackers in the user community used to have with product
designers.  My beard is gray.  I remember when the lead programmers for the
best time-sharing companies used to send a bottle of good booze to anyone
who alerted them to security problems in their systems.  A good tradition,
IMNSHO -- and one which I tried to continue when I picked up the check for
our dinner and Mudge's choice of wine.  (I'll bill SDTI;-)
        All the recent effort to bust the decade-old SecurID algorithm and
the ACE network protocol seem a little anachronistic, of course.  I suppose
it's kind of a grand salute to an old security warhorse (and SecurIDs are
still the first line of defense in most Fortune 500 companies.)  There has
been no formal announcement, but -- as J�ri suggested -- I think most of
the ACE/SecurID user community expects that both the network protocol and
the token's internal algorithm will be upgraded sometime in the very near
future.  (On a timeline SDTI established several years ago.)  And any new
ACE protocol will inevitably establish a stateful session for the
authentication exchange -- which will make the current generation of race
attacks historical novelties.
        SDTI Engineering (and most likely RSA Labs) have probably been
banging away at the new design for a long time.  RSA was deeply involved
with SDTI long before their recent merger;  RSA helped develop the F2 hash
that is used in the ACE client/server security protocol.  (It's this F2
hash that "Anonymous" is begging some Cypherpunk to steal,
reverse-engineer, and publish for everyone to play with.  Bad, bad,
commercial crypto!  Wouldn't want anyone to make money off strong
cryptography, would we??)
        It remains to be seen where the merger of the top OTP firm and the
top commercial crypto firm leads us --  but I, among many, hope the
widely-installed ACE/Server (with its potent RDBS) will provide the
key-management infrastructure that will allow the introduction of
enterprise-wide crypto on a scale seen only in the nightmares of the NSA's
congressional lobbyists.
        Mr. Gilmore is not the only one who has been plotting to vastly
expand the installed base of strong crypto in the coming year.

@_subject: SecurID 
Paul J. Bell  gave a desperate shout for help:
        I think Enigma Logic, Digital Pathways, and Cryptocard -- all
vendors of competitive one-time passsword (OTP) tokens --have diatribes
against the ACE/SecurID system on their web sites.  Check them out.  Over
the past two years, there have also been a number of fairly in-depth
debates about SecurIDs and the ACE protocols on the Firewalls mailing list
(ftp the archives at greatcircle.com) and in comp.security.unix. My SecurID
FAQ, available from SDTI at  might give you ideas
        Most people find the SecurID (and most of its competitors)
relatively well-designed and and secure devices.  Most of the negative
comment I've seen is from competitors who say the SecurID and it's ACE
support system is too expensive, and from ACE administrators who gripe that
the software is not optimized for their favorite platform.  It is
unfortunately true that SDTI  has not yet mastered the knack of producing
perfectly bugless code. Earlier this year SDTI also fouled up badly when
they failed to bring their Customer Support operation up to speed to
support a new generation of authentication servers (ACE 2.X) which involved
a relatively more complex Unix installation.  They've spent a lot of money
and hired a lot of people, but I don't think there is yet a consensus about
whether they've licked that.
        Still, some people think they get their money's worth.  SecurID is
the OTP token of choice at most (80 percent +) large corporate sites --in a
market with a lot of competitors, including well-done freeware OTP
alternatives: s/key and OPIE.  Of course, those buyers could all be wrong.
          SDTI's success is really built on the fact that users -- the
people who actually carry the tokens -- usually say they like the SecurID
better than the alternatives.  The SecurID claims the lion's share of the
market  because it is relatively intuitive and easy to use: the PIN and
token-code can be typed in like a (long) traditional password.  The
alternative tokens -- all challenge/response devices -- force the user to
engage in a multi-step process to get a random challenge from the remote
host, tap it into the token, encrypted it, then send it back to the host as
the OTP.
      SecurIDs are supported by an ACE authentication server which  --
alone among the OTP vendors -- holds its Access Control files in a
commercial-grade SQL-savvy relational database, which means that can be
interlinked with HR or any other SQL-savvy corporate RDBS.  As the industry
sets the stage for enterprise-wide IP security (hopefully soon to include
crypto) many  believe the authentication server's capabilities become more
important than the token's design.
        But, hey, those folks could be wrong.
        SDTI also just bought RSA Data Security, which some feel enhances
its prospects for making some further contribution to enterprise security.
Even before that, some 50 of the leading independent vendors of
network-based products (from firewalls and comm servers to big databases)
had chosen to integrate ACE/SecurID client code into a huge variety of
products.  This is a fairly unprecidented level of industry support -- but
they might be all wrong too.
        ACE/SecurID is notable among other OTP systems for both its support
infrastructure (STDI supported the client/server architecture five years
before any other OTP vendor,) and because it is a (patent-protected)
time-synched device: the 30/60-second dynamic token-code the SecurID
displays is a hash of Current Time and a token-specific secret seed. This
has pros and cons (honest,  both pros and cons;-)
        Unfortunately, what ACE/SecurID does not do -- what no OTP can do

@_subject: <fwd> FV's crypted credit card "attack" 
As you may already have heard via the popular press, First Virtual
Holdings has developed and demonstrated a program which completely
undermines the security of every known credit-card encryption mechanism
for Internet commerce.  This is a very serious matter, and we want to
make sure that the Internet community is properly informed about the
nature of the problem that we have uncovered, and the manner in which we
have made the information known.  In this (unavoidably lengthy) post, I
will try to explain the nature of the problem and its implications for
Internet commerce.  In deference to those who are not technically
oriented, the detailed explanation of how the attack works will be the
LAST part of this message.
First of all, let me be perfectly clear about the nature of the problem
we have exposed.  It is NOT a bug in a single program, and it is
therefore NOT something that can be fixed with a "patch" or any other
kind of software upgrade.  Instead, we have demonstrated a very general
attack that undermines ALL programs that ask users to type a credit card
number into their home computer.  We have tested the program and
confirmed that it undermines the security of the credit card encryption
software from Netscape and Cybercash, and we expect that it will work
similarly for ANY future software based on the encryption of credit card
numbers on the desktop.  Quite simply, we believe that this program
demonstrates a FATAL flaw in one whole approach to Internet commerce,
and that the use of software to encrypt credit card numbers can NEVER be
made safe.  For consumers, we recommend the following simple rule:
NEVER TYPE YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER INTO A COMPUTER.
We should also be clear about the Internet commerce mechanisms that are
NOT affected by this problem.  First Virtual is unaffected because we
never ask the user to put a credit card number at risk by typing it into
a computer.  Hardware-based solutions can also be devised that are
immune to this attack, including solutions based on smart cards and
solutions based on "card swipe" machines in the home.  We believe that
current digital cash solutions are also not vulnerable to this attack,
although some variants of digital cash may be vulnerable to a similar
form of attack.  Commerce mechanisms based on the use of telephones or
fax machines to transmit credit card numbers are also unaffected by this
kind of attack.  Other proposed commerce mechanisms should, from now on,
be evaluated with this kind of attack in mind.  The bottom line:
INTERNET COMMERCE CAN BE VERY SAFE, WITH SEVERAL DIFFERENT MECHANISMS,
BUT ENCRYPTING CREDIT CARDS ON THE DESKTOP IS NOT ONE OF THE SAFE
It's important to understand why we have taken this step.  Obviously, as
the long-time leaders in Internet commerce, the last thing we would want
to do is to undermine general confidence in Internet commerce.  However,
we realized that many people believed that credit card encryption was a
safe and easy path to Internet commerce, and that very few people
understood how easily it could be undermined.  Upon investigation, we
were frankly startled to realize just how easy it was -- a single
programmer got the first version of our program running in about a week.
 Aside from our obvious interest in promoting our own commerce
mechanism, we felt that we had an ethical obligation to bring this
problem to the attention of the consumers, banks, and other financial
institutions who could conceivably suffer catastrophic losses if
software encryption of credit card numbers became widespread.
We also realize that we have an obligation to do everything possible to
avoid helping any unscrupulous people who might seek to utilize this
flaw for malicious purposes.  We have accordingly been extremely
responsible in how we have handled our discovery.  We first demonstrated
and explained our program to vital organizations such as CERT (the
Computer Emergency Response Team) and the ABA (American Banking
Association).  Only after many such private disclosures, none of which
revealed any defense against our technique, did we publicly disclose the
existence of this program.
In addition, we have taken several steps to "cripple" our demonstration
program, all of which will be discussed below.    Furthermore, we have
NOT made the program itself generally available.  We are currently
demonstrating it to selected financial institutions and government
agencies, and will provide copies of the program only to CERT and a few
other independent security-minded organizations.  We have also alerted
Netscape to the problem as part of their "bugs bounty" program.  At some
future date, we might conceivably distribute the program, in binary form
on CD ROM, to selected financial institutions.  The source code will
always be very closely guarded.  Unfortunately, however, the general
method of attack is extremely easy to duplicate, and we don't know of
any good way to alert the public to the problem without explaining it.
THE TECHNIQUE
Our basic approach was to write a computer program that runs undetected
while it monitors your  computer system. A sophisticated version of such
a program can intercept and analyze every  keystroke, mouse-click, and
even messages sent to your screen, but all we needed was the keystrokes.
Selectively intercepted information can be immediately and secretly
transmitted via  Internet protocols, or stored for later use.
First Virtual's research team has built and demonstrated a particular
implementation of such a program, which only watches for credit card
numbers.  Whenever you type a credit card number into your computer --
even if you are talking to "secure" encryption software -- it captures
your card number.  Our program doesn't do anything harmful with your
credit card number, but merely announces that it has captured it.  A
malicious program of this type could quietly transmit your credit card
number to criminals without your knowledge.
The underlying problem is that the desktop -- the consumer's computer --
is not secure.  There is no way of ensuring that all software installed
on the consumer's machine can be trusted.  Given this fact, it is unwise
to trust ANY software such as a "secure" browser, because malicious
software could have easily been interposed between the user and the
trusted software.
The bottom line for consumers is that, on personal computers,
INFORMATION IS INSECURE THE MOMENT YOU TOUCH A KEY.  We  have
dramatically proven that security  ends the moment you type sensitive
information into your computer. The vulnerability lies in the fact that
information must travel from your  keyboard, into your computer's
operating system, and then to your "secure" application. It can be
easily intercepted along the way.
This kind of insecurity is very frightening, and has implications far
beyond credit card theft.  However, credit cards embody and demonstrate
the kind of information that is MOST vulnerable to this kind of attack.
Credit card numbers are far more vulnerable to this kind of attack than
most other forms of information because of the following particular
characteristics of credit card numbers:

@_subject: The FV Problem = A Press Problem 
Mr. Bornenstein's press release ("FV's position on Merc article")
was egregiously self-serving and embarrassingly over-inflated.
        Yet, First Virtual's CC-focused keyboard sniffer ("...a program
which completely undermines the security of every known credit card
encryption mechanism for Internet commerce") and his postulated widespread
stealth attack on unprotected consumer PCs highlighted an obvious -- but
oft forgotten, at least in non-CompSec circles -- vulnerability.
        An encrypted link is only as secure as the CPUs at either end.  Not
an unimportant consideration as we plunge into Internet commerce; and
surely a valid point for one vendor to make, if it suggests unrecognized
risks in a competitor's scheme for consumer purchases and payments.
        Borenstein is handling his inevitable mugging in C'punks with zest
and considerable aplomb; even including an apology for submitting his
sensationalistic attack on crypto-based competitors to this List.  Before
folks leap from FV's text to damning the San Jose Mercury New's articles by
Simson Garfinkel, however, they should pause and read or maybe re-read
Garfinkel's three articles.         Mr. Garfinkel is probably the single most technically-literate
journalist writing about computer security for mainstream (or trade press)
media.  His Mercury News article is precisely focused on FV's initiative in
developing this demo program (a trojan screen saver) and the campaign by
the Southern California company to use the demo to illustrate a relatively
unguarded aspect of Netscape's SSL-protected credit card transactions,
which have been widely touted as the be-all of Network Commerce.
        It was, as Garfinkel bluntly put it: "a direct attack against the
security promised by Netscape Communication Corp.'s popular Netscape
        Mr. Borenstein later expressed his regret that Garfinkel had cast
the story as a competitive attack, but IMNSHO Garfinkle was right on
target: the FV campaign was a targeted bombardment of their most prominent
competitor.  And a campaign it was -- well deserving media attention.
        FV apparently carted their demo code and attack model back and
forth across the country. FV gave presentations to NIST, NSA, the US
Treasury, and the White House, according to Garfinkel.
        The only silly comment in Garfinkel's article was a direct quote
from FV's Bornenstein: "One of the things we've heard from people inside
government were comments along the line, 'We thought only NSA knew how to
do this....'"
        (And if a world-class CompSec/UNIX expert like Garkinkel wasn't
chuckling when he wrote that -- and expecting knowledgeable readers to
giggle and grin when they read it --  I'll stew and eat my beaver hat!)
        The Merc's quotes from independent security experts -- commenting
on FV's attack model -- were notably dry and balanced.  Yes, the attack and
threat vectors were real -- but, noted the American Banker's Association's
Kawika Daguio: "It is a classic attack."
        "I've seen it, and I've seen things like it before," said Mr.
Daguio.  Nothing new. Matt Bishop, the UC prof, also sounded less than awed
by FV's creativity: "There is no reason why one could not write a program
to monitor keystrokes, look for numbers which look like credit card
numbers, and sent them out over the Internet," in an unobtrusive way, to a
thief elsewhere.
        (Prof. Bishop might have had more to say, had he been told it took
a FV programmer a _month_ to write a keyboard sniffer optimized for credit
card data;-)
        As a newcomer to this List, I have the impression that C'punks are
a little jaded when it comes to mass-market CompSec and ComSec threats --
and perhaps a little rabid when it comes to anyone rash enough to suggest
that the first mass-market crypto product (in the hands of naive consumers,
with unprotected PCs and poor CompSec habits) may have dangerous procedural
vulnerabilities.   A little perspective, guys!
        Crypto from an insecure base has risks that deserve to be
highlighted; and credit cards numbers are uniquely negotiable passwords.
FV is scare-mongering, sure -- but that's combat marketing.  Mr.
Borenstein's press release posted in C'punks was chumming with raw bloody
beef -- and that was just dumb -- but it was striking how blithely many
folks here acknowledged (and immediately dismissed) the threat he
        Nothing wrong with FV trying to slow the bandwagon of a major
competitor by drawing attention to vulnerabilities or potential
vulnerabilities of their technology in a mass market.    This happens a lot

Greg Broiles  opined:
        True enough.  Of course, those are the folks who take the weight
when credit card sales go sour... or the system is victimized by widespread
automated fraud.
        Actually, the most striking thing about the Garfinkel articles was
the degree to which he made the First Virtual marketing/propaganda Campaign
against consumer-PC-based credit card encryptors _the focus_ of the Mercury
News articles.
        FV's attack-code demo was overtly presented as a propaganda ploy --
"a direct attack" on Netscape's security model -- by Garfinkel.  There was
nothing in the Merc text that carried the hysterial pitch of the press
release FV posted to C'punks; nothing of the pious Crusade to Save
Electronic Commerce that set everyone teeth on edge.  FV's Stein and
Borenstein were presented as competitive businessmen, out to rough up a
competitor who had been getting too much uncritical attention.  (The long
sidebars on FV's technology are what you'd expect for the Mercury News'
coverage of a local SoCal contender.)
        The Murky News' "Chief Scientist, FV" quote -- Borenstein recalling
audiences in the White House, Treasury, etc., who declared, "We thought
that only the  NSA knew how to do this." -- was absolutely priceless.
Everyone who didn't need a ten-page memo to supply the technical and
historical context got the giggle. It's the Quote of the Week in Silicon
Valley and NoHo.
        Deftly, with a straight face, Garfinkel left Nathaniel standing
there with his pants down, wondering where the draft was coming from.  (Mr.
Borenstein, no slouch on-line, has faired far better in his give and take

        snow's jibe about doing the same with a handful of spooky special
forces guys (less than 15, if he used snipers) was appropriate.
        I think, however, Dale Drew went too far when he denied that the
demension of the Net added nothing new to the range of social or economic
threat.  Don't we, as a technical culture, have to acknowledge the
burgening nihilism that is exemplified in both the subculture of virus (and
other randomly distructive pieces of attack code,) and the larger culture
that so often lauds their "creativity" and "ingenuity."  Not even
lumpen-Libertarianism allows the author of such pain and distruction to
escape moral responsibility -- yet the popular tech culture (and the pop
culture) does just that!
        The culture can deal with purposeful terrorism, even purposeful Net
terrorism,  but a whole subculture of sociopaths who -- like arsonists on a
binge, or (to exaggerate slightly) the nerve gas cult in Japan -- toss out
distructive code bombs to see who or what gets blown away, is indeed
something new.
        How many wild viruses are now loose?  What new corners of the
networked infrastructure will be the next forum for these arsonists?  Java
applets?  NT?  The nodes of the Net itself?
        Is this too to be left to police suppression?  Are Net Cops
inevitable?  Are there other forces that could be brought to bear?  (Forces
that could perhaps be influenced by the tone or substance of comments that
originate here or in similar forums?)  And isn't this threat unique to a
culture which has become so dependant on the structured flow of information
products and tools?
        The sky isn't falling; there are no bodies in the street -- so we
have time... but the sense of threat could become so serious that the
public would seek shelter, solice, stability. The spooks' wet-dream, the
wiretapped Garrison Nation (two-way TV always on; no one allowed to whisper

Mr. Nobody, an anonymous source of no repute, posted a pretty savvy
analysis of the politics of unauthorized wiretaps a week back:
        This conforms to my information too.  Back in the mid-80s, I  took
a wiretap counterintelligence class with a lot of cops, PIs, and oil
company securitymen.  (The quietest guy in the class, a balding little
whimp at the tech bench behind me, was a PI by the name of John Walker, who
later drew some attention with his overseas business interests.  The
weirdiest guy in the class was another PI who kept trying to talk to the
other guys about their work but was jerked around because everyone knew he
was always wired and at the end of the day would rush back to his hotel
room to put the tapes through a voice stress analyser.  I would have said
the most dangerous guys in the room were the grizzled Malasian oilmen, but
in hindsight Walker probably takes the prize.)
        The instructors were big Ray Jarvis (now of Jarvis Security,) an
ex-Marine reputed to have recently been the CIA's top wireman, and Allan
Bell (now of Dektor Counterintelligence,) the former director of the US
Army's spy shop R&D (who probably has as many secret patents as Friedman
did) -- both smart, thoughtful, amiable guys who knew their tradecraft
        What I remember most of the week long class was Ray Jarvis standing
before my classmates and estimating that maybe 10-15 percent of the
domestic wiretapping and bugging -- circa '85 -- by US police agencies was
legally authorized.  He paused and looked around the room for the
consensus. Half the room (mostly big city US cops) paused, looked off in
the distance for a moment, then nodded.
         My sense is that lawmen typically planted the relevant information
in the hands (or mouths) of a maluable "trusted source" when they did the
wire themselves.  If a subcontractor did it for them (on a purposely vague
assignment,) they just didn't ask how the "trusted source" managed to get
the information.  Either way, it worked like money laundering.  Source
laundering, you could call it.
        The cops didn't seem to view themselves as angels, but they were
usually utterly certain the guys they were targeting were the scum of the
earth.  Maybe they were. My expectation was that most of the illicit wires
would be focused on the drug trade (where cops feel like the Border Patrol
in El Paso, hopelessly outclassed by their opponents) but -- at least at
that time -- the scuttlebutt seemed to indicate it was much more broadly
used in criminal investigations. Both wiretaps and bugs are just so damn
easy to place, so cheap, so deniable, and (done properly) so untracable,
the temptation was virtually irresistable.  And there seemed to be a whole
subculture of master wiremen, trained by the US Govt, accepting bids from
both the Law and corporate security agents.
        (Outside the US, particularly in the oil business, it sounded like
the Wild West before Judge Bean showed up.   I've never doubted that the
cost of a DES-cracking special purpose computer has been buried among the
expense chits of many multinationals, certainly in the Big Oil Government
budgets.  I'd love to talk to the NSA guys who went in with Desert Storm to
find out what the Iraqis picked up from Kawaiti government/oil IS
        I don't expect much has changed, except everything has gotten
smaller, cheaper, and (with datacom) vastly more automated.  What those
guys knew in the 80s were the phone systems (poor design left many PBXs
with back doors, some of which could even be triggered remotely) but we've
all learned new tricks -- and the NSA and others always concentrated on
         In this, I doubt Mr. Nobody.  I can't see either the Brits nor the
Yanks willing to trust the other nation's bureaucratic system to keep
in-country spying secret.  The rule was: governments leak... eventually.
And the fallout of Revelation would be awesome.  (And there were so many
safer options.)
        I suppose, however, Nobody's scheme fits the "laundered source"
model too.  I recall talk of this sort of arrangement mostly to cover US
citizen to US citizen phone links across the US border.  I'm not even sure
the NSA couldn't legitimately do this, but after the Church Committee
hearings in the 1970s, everyone wanted to keep their numbers low.  (The
extreme was the FBI, of course, which would show up annually to report
what? 7 or 11 authorized wiretaps for the year.   Everyone barely able to
control their snickers.)
        My apologies if Memory Lane took up too much bandwidth, but the
politics of crypto have a heritage that's ever more relevant.  (Witness all
the direct and indirect reference to Kahn and Bamford's work on this List.)
        A thought:  Being pessimistic lately, and assuming our elected US
pols continue their subservience to the spy agencies, I have a question.
How difficult would be it to concoct a encryption-based scheme which would
hold escrow keys in some sort of serialized time-sensitive one-way account

        The relevant issue is not the code-base.  Copyright "protects" the

        I love PKC with all its promise, but you overstate (and IMHO,
attribute inappropriately) the barriers that slow the adoption of one-time
password authentication in the military... and many other more highly
regarded IS environments.
        Security Dynamics (a client of mine) has sold a million SecurID
two-factor OTP tokens internationally -- and its ACE/Server installations
are freely exported to 20-odd nations, even with its embedded DES code.
There is no barrier against exporting OTP authentication systems, either
two-factor tokens or software!  Bellcore's s/key is available world-wide in
both the popular freeware versions and Bellcore's commercial client/server
version -- and the US Navy  developed and circulates widely its own
freeware rewrite of the s/key OTP code: OPIE.
        Free and commercial OTP code has been effectively COTS for years!
I would be greatly surprised if there has been a published report on the
state of security in the US computer or communications infrastructure
anytime in the past five years which has not highlighted the promise of
OTPs to plug the single most eggregious systemic vulnerability in the
installed base of networked computer systems: static, unchanging, user
passwords vulnerable to anyone with a wayward sniffer utility or (to
collect them by the bushel) able to logon to a target site with one of
those stolen passwords to drop a trojan.
        Without trustworthy user authentication there is no meaningful
computer security, period!  Sen. Sam Nunn, who is now chairing the
Congressional hearings on Security in Cyberspace, is a bright guy --
although he is reputed to be utterly innocent of basic computer skills.
Yet Sam Nunn could have pulled off the total penetration of the 30 USAF

Network Associates Acquires Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
04:46 p.m Dec 01, 1997 Eastern Standard Time
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Dec. 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Network Associates, Inc.
(Nasdaq: NETA, commencing Dec. 2), formerly McAfee Associates
(Nasdaq: MCAF), announced today that it has a signed a definitive
agreement to acquire privately-held Pretty Good Privacy, Inc. (PGP).
The PGP acquisition extends Network Associates' network security and
management software products with the leading applied cryptographic
security solutions for protecting corporate assets and enabling
secure electronic communication.
According to an Ernst and Young study, top threats to network
security include virus attack, sabotage from inside the firewall and
sabotage from outside the firewall. The combination of PGP and
Network Associates unites leaders in addressing these corporate
security threats. Network Associates' McAfee anti-virus security
software is used by over 25 million users and more than 80% of the
Fortune 500. With more than four million users in 50 countries, PGP
is the worldwide de facto standard for Internet email and file
"The synergy across our product lines is phenomenal," said Bill
Larson, chairman and CEO of Network Associates. "We will now be able
to provide an integrated software solution for securing both
corporate networks and enterprise data."
"There is a pressing need for comprehensive, integrated security
solutions," said Phil Dunkelberger, general manager of Network
Associates' Total Network Security Division, (formerly president and
CEO of PGP.) "The combination of resources and talent of the
respective companies will provide customers with a premier
enterprise-scale security solution."
Network Associates leads the way in providing large corporate
customers with integrated network security and management suites.
Network Associates' Total Virus Defense Suite incorporates client,
server and gateway protection against computer viruses, and is a
leading offering in its class. The PGP encryption and management
products, including the PGP Business Security Suite, will be the
cornerstone for a complementary suite offered by Network Associates
called the Total Network Security Suite. By combining Network
Associates' intrusion and virus detection products with Business
Security Suite's desktop encryption software, and key server and
policy management tools, the Total Network Security Suite will
address, in a single solution, the needs of network administrators
and corporate security officers.
PGP has long been a pioneer in the security industry, contributing
significantly to many of the principles that have driven the
industry. Network Associates will continue to support the guiding
principles that have made PGP a successful technology. These
principles include a commitment to strong encryption and open
standards. Network Associates will build on the progress made with
the Internet Engineering Task Force, including RFC2015 and the Open
PGP working group, to develop standards for security designed to
unify industry practice.
The acquisition, which is expected to close on or about December 15,
1997, is subject to PGP stockholder approval and other customary
closing conditions. Members of PGP's board of directors and
management, and certain other major PGP stockholders have agreed
separately with Network Associates to vote their PGP shares in favor
of the acquisition. The aggregate consideration payable in the
acquisition is approximately $36 million (payable at closing in cash
and the assumption of certain liabilities) and warrants to acquire a
specified number of shares of Network Associates common stock. The
acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting. In accordance with generally accepted accounting
principle, Network Associates expects to incur a significant charge
to earnings for the Dec. 31, 1997 quarter related to the purchase of
in-process research and development.
With headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., Network Associates, Inc.,
formerly McAfee Associates, is a leading supplier of enterprise
network security and management solutions. Network Associates'
product offering includes four individual software suites, Total
Virus Defense, Total Network Security, Total Network Visibility and
Total ServiceDesk, which can be centrally managed from within the
Network Associates' NetTools unified management environment. For

WSJ Article, by Lisa Bransten (WSJ Interactive Edition)
"McAfee Announces Name Change, Acquisition of Pretty Good Privacy"
McAfee Associates Inc., a Santa Clara, Calif., maker of
network-security software, said Monday that it agreed to acquire
Pretty Good Privacy Inc., a privately held maker of encryption
software, in a deal valued at $36 million.
Separately, McAfee completed its acquisition of Network General and
said it was officially changing its name to Network Associates Inc.
One investment banker estimated PGP's revenue at almost $8 million
this year and at as much as $18 million next year. [Network Associates
Chairman and CE0 Bill] Larson said Network Associates made an all-cash
offer for PGP because of the low price of shares of McAfee (now
Network Associates).
Mr. Larson called the acquisition "a reflection of how significant
an opportunity we see in the security market." Mr. Larson called PGP
a "neophyte" but also "a strategic player" in security software,
adding that Network Associates "will be a player in this market."
PGP, based in San Mateo, Calif., was once a leading contender for an
initial public offering but ran into troubles in the middle of the
year as sales stagnated and a planned acquisition of software
company Zoomit Corp. fell apart. Zoomit makes software that allows
for easy communication across different networks.
PGP founder and chief technologist Philip Zimmermann has developed
something of a cult following among software programmers and
cyber-rights activists since the early 1990s, when he started giving
away his Pretty Good Privacy program, which allows computer users to
encrypt electronic messages sent over the Internet.
Mr. Zimmermann distributed the software for free in order to get it
into the most users' hands amid growing concerns that governments
would try to limit the use of encryption technology, fearful that
such technology would stymie law-enforcement agencies' efforts.
Appetite for the software proved large and millions of copies of the
software were downloaded by users around the world.
Mr. Zimmermann's case became a cause celebre among activists when
the Justice Department opened an investigation of him for allowing
the software to be distributed internationally. Although the
government allows the use of such encryption technologies in the
U.S., it doesn't allow the export of strong-encryption software
except in special circumstances.
In 1996, the government dropped its investigation of Mr. Zimmermann,
and in March of that year he and several partners incorporated PGP
to sell commercial versions of the software to large corporations
interested in security. Mr. Zimmermann will stay with the company as
a Network Associates Fellow.
"We get a great group of leading cryptographers," [Larsen] said. "There
are very few of these people in the world, and PGP has always been a
magnet for [them.]"
PGP, which has about 50 employees, has fought to have its encryption
software adopted as a standard, but software giants Microsoft Corp.
and Netscape Communications Corp. have both licensed the encryption
software of PGP rival RSA Data Security Inc., which was itself
purchased last year by Security Dynamics Technologies Inc.
Before Monday's announcement, several observers had said that PGP
and McAfee would be a logical combination because companies are
looking for software that can address more than one of their
security and networking needs. Also, PGP's encryption technology and
large installed user base could bolster McAfee's recent entry into
that field, they said.
PGP has "good brand recognition and good technology, but no
marketing muscle," said one industry watcher. "If PGP's encryption
standard is going to compete, they need a distribution partner like
McAfee behind them."
Shares of Network Associates will begin trading under the new Nasdaq
symbol NETA on Tuesday.

@_subject: Comparing PGP to Symantec's Secret Stuff 
(I just posted this in a discussion on alt.security.pgp, and thought it
might also be of interest to the List. _Vin)
   ALCO Jakarta  queried the Newsgroup:
   That's comparing real crypto vs a sophisticated version of the Captain
Crunch crypto ring.
   PGP in all of its forms uses strong crypto, which is why it is
difficult to legally export it from the US to any overseas entity, except
branches and subsidiaries of US firms.  (Thus, the effort to sustain the
international version of PGP, and PhilZ's long travail while the US govt
tried to investigate how those sneaky non-Yanks got their hands on this
oh-so-useful RSA/IDEA utility.)
   Norton Secret Stuff secures the data using the 32-bit Blowfish
encryption algorithm -- which is why it's approved for unrestricted export
outside the US by the U.S. government.
   It's far better than, say, ROT13 -- but it would not provide meaningful
confidentiality or security for anything of any worth, or anything which
might otherwise spur a curious and clever grad student to spend somewhere
between a couple hours (with a college computer lab at his proposal) to a
few days (on a fast PC) doing a brute force search of all possible 32-bit
   A more complex comparison would put PGP against Norton's YEO, but that
too is an apples to oranges matchup, albiet with strong crypto on both
sides.  PGP was designed to be a mail encyptor. YEO -- with RSA + RC4,
RC5, DES, DES3, and Blowfish too, I think -- was designed as a file and
disk encryptor.  Each is optimized for its primary function.
   The lack of published source code is an issue, but if you see such a
product being purchased by multinationals or US defense contractors you
can be certain the implementation -- which is the real arena of
vulnerability, once the algorithm is chosen -- has been carefully studied
by informed cryptographers. (For non-American product, look for similar
purchases by government-connected agencies in the vendor's nation.)
   You don't sound like the source code is going to do _you_ any good,
right? Like most buyers, you have to trust the judgement of talented pros
   Actually, corporate or commercial products are better than that.
   Secret Stuff is overtly weak crypto.  It's also free from Symantec.
   Norton YEO from Symantec, or any competitive heavy-duty product like
RSA SecurPC, will be clearly labelled as to the relative strength (key
length) of their crypto -- strong for domestic user; weak for the intl
mass market -- in terms anyone with a basic understanding of crypto and
crypto export regs can understand.  Export permits for the strong domestic
versions of products like these will be all but impossible to obtain for
mass market sales to non-American individuals. (Neither of these firms
probably sells or even tries to sell the export version overseas; the
weaker products exist largely because US corporate buyers demand an
interoperable product that _can_ be shipped to overseas associates.)
   Export permits to ship the strong-crypto version of these products
American corporations will require that the vendor have a key recovery
mechanism -- no big deal, since we are dealing with stored files, so
backup access is a standard requirement for disaster recovery -- which is
to be held by the US firm in a location which makes it accessible to legal
US court orders.
   Any and all US firms will respond to a legal court order to provide
information.  (Commercial firms in other nations will provide any info
they hold when confronted with a court order too, right?)
   It is always rash to expect any commercial firm in any nation to be
either a martyr or an arbiter of moral or political issues. Corporate
officers have fiduciary responsibilities and they can be replaced.
Corporations get a set of rules from the society in which they operate,
and then -- within the context of those rules -- they seek to maximize
their profit and their stockholders' return on investment with a certain
degree of ruthless intensity.
   That's the nature of the beast.
   When corporate self-interest and some corporate executive's personal
philosophy line up, we get some interesting fireworks -- sometimes even
heroic moments which dramatically change the course of a government's
industrial policy, as in the US banks vehement rejection of the NSA's CCEP
and Clipper programs.  The apparent exception really validates the rule.
It's really rare for the US govt to try to overtly challenge or crush an
American firm like they did with RSADSI for a decade. The NSA tried to
bully the US banking industry and got handed its collective head -- and
got branded as naive and turned into something of a laughingstock as well.
   On the other hand, commercial vendors which provide a product for sale
have to describe and warranty that product as having certain
properties.  If those products are used by individuals or commercial
customers and fail to measure up to their advance billing, the vendor is
thereafter liable for significant (even company-threatening) losses, in
both recompense and punitive damages.
   That's commercial law in the US -- no matter what sort of mealy-mouth
language might be in the shrink-wrap license. US lawyers get a blueprint
of an altar upon which they can sacrifice such firms when they get their
law degree.
   Corporate "submission to gov't will" is a real issue, particularly for
vendors of privacy and security tech -- but for US firms, it is far more
likely to play out formally (as with a court order for a message recovery
key) or in some negotiated backroom deal where the government demands some
feature added, or asks for some feature to be removed from free-market
product, before the vendor is given some commercial advantage like a
government contract, or GSA approval, or an export permit.
   You see the whole American IT industry being put through this sort of
blackmail in the current US crypto export policy.  Only vendors which have
or agree to design key/message "recovery" mechanisms in file or
communications crypto apps get export permits to ship their 56-bit
versions of their crypto products -- or (among other vendors,)
crypto-enhanced applications like RDBSs and operating systems -- to the
international market.
   Nothing subtle or secret about that -- and historically, the model has
probably been pretty much the same, if less blatent.
   US export controls in crypto exist to bludgeon the vendors, so that the
US govt can obtain something it wants in that company's domestic or
overseas product lines. (It certainly does not restrict the international
bad guy's access to strong crypto, no matter what the latest Four Horseman
propaganda is.)
   Today, I think this leverage is probably being applied more on the big
US vendors of operating systems and networking software and major
applications -- all of which require crypto for their commercial products
today -- than it is upon the puny crypto vendors (who are, relatively
speaking, small potatos and aren't allowed to sell strong versions of
their products -- even with message-recovery -- to anyone interesting,
   In commercial encryption products, the hidden backdoors of myth and
legend are far less likely, given the liability issue and US commercial
   Overt and well-labelled backdoors are a different story.    Surete,

@_subject: Good Bye Cypherpunks! 
It's always interesting  to see how another person, particularly a
writer, filters and reshapes an experience you shared with them .
Differences in the telling are inevitable -- but I perceived the recent
experience of the C'punks List quite differently than what Declan described
and implied in his column.
        My understanding of Sandy's effort, for instance, was that he was to
filter out the sludge of spam and contentless name-calling with which some
idiots were flooding the list.  My impression was that he was passing along
any posts with content (ideas, pro or con, on almost anything) but filtering
out the empty obscene name-calling and slurs (many of which seemed anon or
forged, with varied and misleading titles, to duck my kill-file filters.)
        I, for one, was appreciative.  I don't mind flames (and I expected
to still be able to recieve them, from whatever POV -- and it seemed that I
did!) but I also want a little meat somewhere amid the smoke.          Who did the filtering  (at the minimal level I expected) was almost
irrelevant. If the filtering was on content, I'd be unhappy -- but I was
eager to see some effort  to cut out the empty hate messages.  I even
suggested to Dale, off-list, that he take it on for awhile.  To me, the
issue was whether this community could develop some mechanism to defend
itself against a willful and intentional effort to destroy it.  I think we
failed to do so, despite the creative search for alternative venues -- and I
think the triumphant cackling I read on what's left of the List  is quite
out of place.          It may be that ideological purists were able to develop dynamic
local filters on their PCs  which satisfied them, but my filters just
could't do enough.  It was clear that the fecal-buckshot attacks on the List
were designed to evade them.   I'm still here, but it was more than a minor
annoyance.         (A year ago, I knew maybe five friends and acquaintances who
subscribed to C'punks, but they all ran out of patience with the unchecked
flow of sludge and unsubscribed...  months before John tried to introduce
his moderation experiment.)   If 700 dropped off right after the moderation
experiment was announced -- which I somehow doubt -- I wonder how many were
battered into unsubscribing in the six or eight months prior?
        And, of the fleeing 700, how many became bored with the obsession of
some (exhaustively prolific) writers with the "Moderation & Me" -- and went
off to find some discussion of cryptography, politics, and ideas elsewhere?
(Gawd knows, on the then-Moderated List  I never found any lack of
overwrought attacks on Sandy or John.  I even read them for a week or two;-)
        From this whole experience, I carry away something different than
those who gleefully celebrate Gilmore's surrender. I think something unusual
and valuable is being killed.  I'm now convinced that virtually all mailing
lists will soon be forced to either limit posts to authenticated subscribers
or introduce some sort of moderation -- just to deal with the spam threat
and the problem of concerned attacks by those who decide they hate or
dislike or simply want to destroy that particular List community .          By the logic of Tim and others, a clever and dedicated crusade
against Cypherpunks by any minimally-organized group, bir or small -- your
local coven, CoS, RC bishops, FBI, Romanian Govt, , whomever!  -- could have
destroyed the List at any time in the past.  I'm glad they never realized
how vulnerable we were;  I've enjoyed this Community greatly  in its current
manifestation.          I also hate to think of how gleeful the sociopaths who mail-bombed
us into the choice of submission or suicide must be today.  I think it is a
particularly henious crime to destroy a virtual community; something akin to
book-burning, but maybe more like arson -- like burning village schools.      There was a willful attempt to destroy C'punks, an attack of depth and
volume which led many of us (even those who had ignored at least three
earlier efforts to offer filtered subsets to the List)  to welcome the

Hi Anand,
        Nope! Unless there are export controls in India,  your wizards in
Bombay or Dehli (pardon, I forget) can offer their US customers the full and
unrestricted product of their creativity and genius in algorithms, crypto
implementations, and/or crypto protocols.
         There are no restrictions on encryption software being _imported_
into the US, nor are there (at the moment ) any legal (as opposed to
patent or copyright) restrictions on any encryption software of any strength
being _used_ in the US.          For that matter, there are no restrictions on encrypted data being
transmitted across the US border.          And (while it may require a license, apparently an exemption for the
product, as opposed to a sales-by-sale license) there are seemingly no -- or
at least less -- restrictions on the use of specialized encryption products
(within the US) which can generate a "self-decrypting" secure packet which
can be transmitted (cross-border, outside the US) and opened, anywhere, by a
recipient who has been provided with a password/key out of band.
         That is how RSA's SecurPC has been able to offer full 128-bit RC4
encryption to secure US-to-Anywhere international file transfers.          (As with DES, the US Govt is apparently trying to control the export
of a full implementation package -- not the international distribution of a
widely-known algorithm, per se.  As I understand it, the self-decrypting
PCSecure packet does not contain the user interface which allows automatic
encryption, the interface can only decrypt. The RC4 algorithm, of course,
has to be included in the transmission, and it is inherently reversible --
only the user interface is "crippled" to restrict its use to encrypt.
Corrections welcome, if I don't have this exactly right.)          The international traffic in self-decrypting "128-bit" products is
separate and distinct from the issues involved in the recent modifications
of the  US export regs, which allow vendors to get approval to export a
56-bit secret-key encryption product (eg. RC4, RC5, or DES) only  if the
vendor submits a concrete plan, and schedule of implementation, to redesign
their (export) product to require key-escrow or trusted-party
key-recovery/storage.         (In addition whatever recovery key is required by corporate backup
policies, this is also, obviously, a mechanism for GAK, "government access
to keys" --under US law,  hopefully with a court warrant -- and/or whatever
backup/key-recovery/GAK-access mechanism might be required various other
nations in which those products will be imported, used, or transhipped from.)
        And with those GAK-adapted implementations, the US govt. will then
approve, for the first time, general export of robust 128-bit secret-key
products... as they reportedly have for Open Market's SSL, and TIS and
Digital crypto products.

It's always interesting  to see how another person, particularly a
writer, filters and reshapes an experience you shared with them .
Differences in the telling are inevitable -- but I perceived the recent
experience of the C'punks List quite differently than what Declan described
and implied in his column.
        My understanding of Sandy's effort, for instance, was that he was to
filter out the sludge of spam and contentless name-calling with which some
idiots were flooding the list.  My impression was that he was passing along
any posts with content (ideas, pro or con, on almost anything) but filtering
out the empty obscene name-calling and slurs (many of which seemed anon or
forged, with varied and misleading titles, to duck my kill-file filters.)
        I, for one, was appreciative.  I don't mind flames (and I expected
to still be able to recieve them, from whatever POV -- and it seemed that I
did!) but I also want a little meat somewhere amid the smoke.          Who did the filtering  (at the minimal level I expected) was almost
irrelevant. If the filtering was on content, I'd be unhappy -- but I was
eager to see some effort  to cut out the empty hate messages.  I even
suggested to Dale, off-list, that he take it on for awhile.  To me, the
issue was whether this community could develop some mechanism to defend
itself against a willful and intentional effort to destroy it.  I think we
failed to do so, despite the creative search for alternative venues -- and I
think the triumphant cackling I read on what's left of the List  is quite
out of place.          It may be that ideological purists were able to develop dynamic
local filters on their PCs  which satisfied them, but my filters just
could't do enough.  It was clear that the fecal-buckshot attacks on the List
were designed to evade them.   I'm still here, but it was more than a minor
annoyance.         (A year ago, I knew maybe five friends and acquaintances who
subscribed to C'punks, but they all ran out of patience with the unchecked
flow of sludge and unsubscribed...  months before John tried to introduce
his moderation experiment.)   If 700 dropped off right after the moderation
experiment was announced -- which I somehow doubt -- I wonder how many were
battered into unsubscribing in the six or eight months prior?
        And, of the fleeing 700, how many became bored with the obsession of
some (exhaustively prolific) writers with the "Moderation & Me" -- and went
off to find some discussion of cryptography, politics, and ideas elsewhere?
(Gawd knows, on the then-Moderated List  I never found any lack of
overwrought attacks on Sandy or John.  I even read them for a week or two;-)
        From this whole experience, I carry away something different than
those who gleefully celebrate Gilmore's surrender. I think something unusual
and valuable is being killed.  I'm now convinced that virtually all mailing
lists will soon be forced to either limit posts to authenticated subscribers
or introduce some sort of moderation -- just to deal with the spam threat
and the problem of concerned attacks by those who decide they hate or
dislike or simply want to destroy that particular List community .          By the logic of Tim and others, a clever and dedicated crusade
against Cypherpunks by any minimally-organized group, bir or small -- your
local coven, CoS, RC bishops, FBI, Romanian Govt, , whomever!  -- could have
destroyed the List at any time in the past.  I'm glad they never realized
how vulnerable we were;  I've enjoyed this Community greatly  in its current
manifestation.          I also hate to think of how gleeful the sociopaths who mail-bombed
us into the choice of submission or suicide must be today.  I think it is a
particularly henious crime to destroy a virtual community; something akin to
book-burning, but maybe more like arson -- like burning village schools.      There was a willful attempt to destroy C'punks, an attack of depth and
volume which led many of us (even those who had ignored at least three
earlier efforts to offer filtered subsets to the List)  to welcome the
Moderation Experiment. Unfortunately, the attempt at moderation just twisted
our own energies against ourselves.  We were, perhaps predictably, quite
easy to manipulate.
        If I have any criticism of John et al, it is that our List-Owner (a

encryption; maybe 10X the speed of DES.  You could encrypt your zip data
from Explorer either on demand, or automatically upon exiting WIN95. (It

background) crypto, but given the market pressures, it obviously won't be
long in coming.         SecurPC does have a number of other unusual features that might
offset the lack of transparency.  My favorite: At least until the next
version of ERA;-) RSA's SecurPC permits you to ship data over the US borders
encrypted with 128-bit RC4 in a self-extracting file which can be opened by

@_subject: Rivest Patent 
When the always well-informed John Young reported that the US Patent Office
had issued MIT Prof. Ron Rivest US Patent 5835600 for a "Block encryption
algorithm with data-dependent rotations," Eric Cordian
 growled:
Really, Mr. Cordian, you should read a patent before you foo at it. See:
This particular patent is probably less than it first appears to be.
When a patent is marked as "divisional" of a specific application, it means
it has been broken off and separated from a prior patent application.
In this case, when Rivest sought a patent for RC5, a block cipher which is
notable for the elegant simplicity that has become Ron's trademark style,
the Patent Examiner suggested that he refile the application in two parts:
one on the encryption method, and a second on the key-schedule structure.
The patent on the RC5 encryption method, US5724428 -- which has generally
been referred to as the RC5 patent -- was issued March 3, 1998, with the
same title ("Block encryption algorithm with data-dependent rotations") and
an identical Abstract to this more recent patent, US5835600, which was
issued Nov. 10.  See:
This latest patent, US5835600, only covers the design of the key schedule
used in RC5 (and RC6). Period.  The data-dependent rotation claims were in
the earlier RC5 patent.
Even Ron's initial RC5 patent, however, referred to data-dependent
rotations only in the context that they are used in RC5. It surely is not
any universal IP claim.
Among the relevant prior work Rivest cited in his original application (and
US5724428) was Wolfram Becker's work for IBM in the 1970s -- patented in
US4157454 -- which seems to rely on data-dependent rotations too. Note that
the Patent Examiners determined that Becker's work did not impinge upon or
otherwise disqualify Rivest's specific RC5 claims.
(I wouldn't hazard a guess as to whether RSA's RC5 patent covers IBM's MARS
algorithm, as some have suggested, just because MARS also uses
data-dependent rotations. Some on this list may be competent to dice the
issues that fine but I am not.)
Mr. Cordian ventured an additional opinion or two:
Eric Michael Cordian is a Persistant Network Nym which has been around for
quite a while. It recently caught to eye of some crypto mavens on these
lists when Cordian revealed himself as both a pseudonym and a collective
E.M. Cordian has been the net persona behind which a group of
self-described cryptographic professionals have raised $7,500 in donations
to underwrite the "DES Analytic Crack Project," an  ambitious effort
"to develop ANSI C code which will break DES in under one day on a $5k
See: Now, it seems to me reasonable, albiet academic, to argue whether or not
software should be patentable.  It is also certainly reasonable to argue
whether or not cryptographic algorithms should be patentable.
On the other hand, it seems to me unreasonable, willfully ill-informed,
and/or  malovelent to declare -- in the face of several judicial rulings
which have firmly ratified the RSA PKC patent -- that  "prior art" exists
which should have invalidated that patent.  Horseshit!
Stanford and Cylink couldn't find it, despite a highly motivated and
well-funded search. They doubtless would have paid you handsomely for your
evidence and definitive testimony, but you missed your chance.
Now you'll -- collectively, Sirs? -- just have to settle for being another
cadre in the crowd that hoots and sneers at Ron Rivest whenever he comes up
with something new which significantly enhances our cryptographic arsenal
(and has the gall to patent it or otherwise claim IP ownership.)
Seems like a demeaning role for a group of professionals which claim to
collectively have "decades of practical experience in successfully
implementing the most complex computer algorithms."
PS. Regarding the debate about whether RC6 will be freely available, my
understanding (as a consulant to RSA) is that Jim Gillogly has it right.
If RC6 is selected as the American AES, RSA (now a subsidary of Security
Dynamics) will relinquish all patent rights and royalty expectations.  If
RC6 is not selected as the AES -- and given the decades of conflict,
antagonism, and competition between the spooks of the NSA and RSA, RC6 is
surely a remote long shot -- RSA will offer it as a commercial product.
The two RC5 patents appear to cover RC6. The AES evaluation process will
provide an invaluable high-stress testbed for Rivest's innovative use of
data-dependent rotations.  When the AES is chosen by the NSA -- whichever
algorithm is finally chosen -- the cryptographic community will know a lot
more about the security and viability of this particular Rivest design.
Then we can start wondering what Rivest will come up with for Ron's Code
(RC) 7.

between the RSA PKC and the Pohlig-Hellman crypto system, invented at
Stanford University in 1975. For an invention to be patentable, of course,
it must be useful, novel, and non-obvious. Flinn argued that the

According to former NSA Director Bobby Ray Inman, the NSA was working on

algorithm, even if embodied in a pseudo-mechanical device or process,
doesn't deserve patent protection. Since 1981, the US Courts have allowed a
process which includes a mathematical algorithm to be patented  -- if the
algorithm is merely part of an otherwise patentable process. For the RSA
cryptosystem, this seems reasonably straightforward to those without a
religious bias.
Circuit Court:
"Taken as a whole, the RSA patent is entitled to patent protection. The
claims of the patent make use of known structures, a communications
channel, an encoding device and a decoding device, to produce a practical
invention, i.e. a means for securely transmitting messages across an
insecure line. The messages are comprised of word signals that are
transformed from one state, plaintext, to another state, ciphertext, by the
patented invention. The word signals are then transmitted across an
insecure line and transformed by the decoding device from ciphertext into
plaintext. As such, the claimed invention is not merely a disembodied
mathematical concept but rather a specific machine designed to transform
and transmit word signals."
on math-based processes. Mr. Cordian summarized this POV: "The fact that
the [RSA] patent couldn't be successfully challenged even though its
mathematical underpinnings were well known years prior reflects badly only
upon the notion of mathematical patents, and hardly refutes the facts in
evidence." By that logic, it seems to me, a basic knowledge of physics
could invalidate almost all patents for mechanical inventions.)

Section 103 of the US Patent Act provides that a patent is invalid "if the

[64] In 1870, a book by William S. Jevons described the relationship of
one-way functions to cryptography and went on to discuss specifically the
factorization problem used to create the "trap-door" in the RSA system. In
July, 1996, one observer commented on the Jevons book in this way:
In his book The Principles of Science: A Treatise on Logic and Scientific
Method, written and published in the 1890's, William S. Jevons observed
that there are many situations where the 'direct' operation is relatively
easy, but the 'inverse' operation is significantly more difficult, One
example mentioned briefly is that enciphering (encryption) is easy while
deciphering (decryption) is not. In the same section of Chapter 7:
Introduction titled 'Induction an Inverse Operation', much more attention
is devoted to the principle that multiplication of integers is easy, but
finding the (prime) factors of the product is much harder. Thus, Jevons
anticipated a key feature of the RSA Algorithm for public key cryptography,
though he certainly did not invent the concept of public key cryptography.

paragraphs for the pub date of Jevon's "The Principles of Science" is as
published in the original Cyberlaw article. I have no explanation, but the
1870 date seems most likely.  William Stanley Jevons, an astonishingly
prolific American economist, philosopher, and logician, was born 1835 and
died in 1882. He is probably the W.S. Jevons cited here, but I can't be
sure since I can find this title among the list of Jevon books in the
Library of Congress.)
on-line, and the Golomb article doesn't seems available elsewhere.  Might
be worth digging that up. I'd love to read more of what Shannon Award
winner Sol Golomb had to say about the relationship between Jevon's 19th
Century mathematical research and public key cryptography.
_not_ conclude that the functionality of the RSA public key cryptosystem
was "obvious" to anyone familiar with Jevons' work.

         My impression is that NIST covered itself with glory in its handling of the AES competition, but -- really! -- who in their right mind is gonna take the word of a US federal agency that the existence of issued US patents, and the scope of the patent-owner's claims, was irrelevant to their deliberations. (Even if it is true;-)
         My comment was simply that the Hitachi patent claims set the stage for rumors that may shadow the AES choice for years. I think that is unfortunate. Personally, I think it is embarrassing that the Hitachi patents were ever issued.
         My impression is that -- despite their vigorous competitive impulses -- the cryptographers who carried their work into the AES Finals all showed a great deal of respect for each other's work. They all shared the Pantheon of their Craft, and even the contenders were ennobled.  In the aftermath of the NIST decision, I haven't heard sour grapes comments from any of them -- and I would be very surprised if I did. All the grumbling is just background noise from the wee folk, and I suspect it would be pretty much the same tenor, no matter which algorithm was chosen.

         Myself, I wouldn't blame NIST if they factored, as you suggest, avoidance of endless legal hassles into their decision-making process.
         (Nor, when you come down to it, would I be shocked to discover that NIST subsequently lied, or issued misleading comments, about whether the Hitachi patent claims were a factor in their decision... just to keep the AES Process out of the Courts.)
         The Hitachi patents become an inevitable issue -- for conspiracy buffs, if no one else -- only because the winner was the single AES Finalist that Hitachi did not claim was infringing upon its "data rotation" crypto patents.(See          (This, in turn, becomes a little more complicated because, as Schneier et al argue, Rijndael -- despite *not* being mentioned in the Hitachi letter than tagged the other four Finalist -- seems to be as vulnerable, or not, to the Hitachi patents as the named four: MARS, RC6, TwoFish, and Serpent.)
         I don't think anything that (might have) happened in NIST's private AES deliberations can lessen the accomplishment of this historically open process of soliciting, evaluating, and choosing (to the extent that any final selection can be open;-) Rijndael as the AES, from among the five great cryptosystems that were AES Finalists.
         While I appreciate how difficult it is for many -- Yanks and non-Yanks (indeed, anyone who knows anything about US Crypto Politics and the historic subservience of NIST to the NSA) -- to dismiss the influence of the US signals intelligence agencies upon the AES process as negligible, I think we lucked out.
         In the aftermath of the flawed Clipper Chip fiasco -- the Fortezza disaster; the pro-crypto rebellion of the EC; with the steady deterioration of the NSA's stature mystique in Congress and among American businessmen, and the common presumption that electronic commerce is the economic engine for the first decade of the 21st Century -- I think we got an open AES review, and a reasonable final choice among the best cryptosystems that could be solicited from the most capable (non-governmental) cryptographers available.  Hosanna!
         Skeptics may quibble on relative weight put on various stated criteria, but no one familiar with the professional stature, respective egos, and personal independence of the "AES cryptographers," as a group, is going to suggest that these development teams were tame, tainted with some spooky impulses to offer only so much crypto strength and no more.
         That a Belgian cryptosystem was eventually selected as the American AES may make it easier to dismiss those fears overseas, and may hasten the adoption of AES internationally. Full AES standardization and interoperability, a good thing, should come more quickly.
         Given the integrity of the larger AES process -- and the universal respect Rijndael seemed to win among all the cryptographers involved -- I think it is clear that the relative weight of the Hitachi patent claims in NIST's AES selection process was minor.
         Whether, minor or not, that impact might have shifted the balance from another contender to Rijndael is impossible to say. Unless, of course, you accept NIST's simple declaration in its Report on the Development of the AES: , pg. 79. Noting that NISt had solicited, collected, and analyzed IP claims relevant to the AES candidates, the report baldly states: "...IP was not a factor in NIST's selection of the proposed AES algorithm."
         That says, I think, that no IP claims against the AES Finalists were substantive enough to influence the final selection. (As an American, of course, I believe that skepticism about the truthfulness of any governmental declarations is an inalienable right, as well as common sense.) NIST's bureaucratic language is also just cryptic enough to support alternative interpretations. How "not a factor?"
         A recent C'punk tirade about NIST, AES, and HItachi from the irrepressible John Young, patron and editor of the Cryptome website, beats this drum; Mr. Young seeks deep secrets, undocumented considerations, tell-all revelations. (My own feeling is that it may be a bit much to expect NIST to publicly piss all over valid US patents and the US PTO.  Maybe a terse declaration like that in the AES Report is about all cynics should expect at this time.)
         Mind you, NIST's AES Report also explained that the AES (Rijndael) will be published as a FIPS with a pro forma warning that existing patents might lead to claims against users of the AES standard.
         In truth, I'm not sure how big a deal it would be if the Hitachi patents -- and inadequacies of the US PTO and its recent history of issuing unlikely and bizarre patents in IT -- were found to have been, despite current denials, a factor in the eventual selection of Rijndael over the other contenders.
         Politically, I suspect that hanging a "deciding factor" in the AES decision on the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) would not be a prudent thing for NIST executives to do, particularly in the heat of a Gore/Bush Presidential race. It might focus a lot of querulous public attention on the less than glorious track record of the US Patent Office under the Clinton/Gore Administration.
         I figure there are always a lot of things unspoken, certainly unreported, in any big policy decision like this. Who can doubt it?
         (Even the AES timetable -- with the decision dropped in the middle of a Presidential race -- seems to a cynic like me designed to give NIST its best chance for keeping the AES Selection Process open and above board.)
         Given the quality of all the Final Five, others might make as good a case for an (unacknowledged by NIST) pro-Rijndael bias by noting that only Rijndael and Serpent were "non-corporate" entries.
         Or that Rijndael and Serpent were the only non-American AES Finalists -- and that Rijndael's designers (unlike Serpent's team of Ross Anderson et al) seem to be comparatively unpolitical or apolitical.
         [I chuckle to think of the consternation at GCHQ and several British Ministries if Prof. Anderson -- long an articulate and effective critic of the UK's slide toward a "Surveillance Society" -- picked up the additional stature of being co-author of the AES.]
         One can blither through endless permutations. And some will. Cryptographic standards like the proposed AES will inevitably attract doubtful critics and conspiratorial rumors.  I trust that the ongoing validation of Rijndael over the next few years will settle them.

@_subject: CDR: Re: Musings on AES and DES 
I suggest that you give insufficient weight to the importance of the NSA imprimatur on the DES.
         The DES became the standard we know today -- for years, universally accepted in US commerce, banking, and trade -- largely because the US National Security Agency (NSA) issued, upon the designation of the DES by NIST, a statement that the NSA's cryptanalysts knew of no attack on the DES algorithm more effective than a brute force search of all possible 56-bit keys.
         That -- and perhaps NIST's projections of the work and time required to break a 56-bit key -- provided the "due diligence" groundwork that allowed US bankers and businessmen to label crypto a solved problem. No liability could accrue to a CTO or CEO or product manager who chose to use the DES (and, conversely, no one but a fool would use an alternative cipher --whatever the key length -- in a commercial environment.)
         The 1976 designation of the DES -- unlike most traditional standardization efforts -- was not about interoperability. It was not even about relative cryptographic strength (although there must have been some fascinating charts at Fort Meade which projected the life-span of a 56-bit key against the successive five-year certifications built into the DES          The broad acceptance of the DES in US industry and finance was, in large part, simply a function of the way a NSA-blessed cipher contained and limited potential liability.
         In the real world, the technical review that you celebrate -- among academic mathematicians and the(relatively few) unencumbered cryptographers in academia and private industry -- was all but irrelevant. (Only negative results would make a difference, and those were scant and slow in coming.)
         I would argue that, at least in the US, that research had virtually no impact on those who made the relevant purchase and policy decisions (who were seldom crypto-savvy, let alone crypto-literate.)
         Until well into the 1990s, there was no significant non-governmental crypto community to offer alternative judgements until fairly recently... and it must be said that the widespread trust, among American civilians, in the NSA's judgement in this matter was not misplaced.
         DES was pretty much what they said it was (even down to that tweak in the S-boxes to block differential analysis, which the academic crypto researchers didn't discover for many years.) The NSA was/is really very good at what they did, and -- particularly in the US computer industry (which until 1960 had been pretty much guided by NSA R&D contracts) -- their cryptanalytic expertise was wholly unchallenged.
         I presume that the AES selection process was open, to the degree that it was, largely to permit the large contemporary private-sector and the academic crypto community an opportunity to participate in, and endorse, the final AES selection. I suspect, however, that the formal adoption of the AES FIPS -- when Rijndael is designated the approved mechanism for securing sensitive but unclassified government data -- will involve some similar NSA endorsement, implicit or explicit.
         It will be interesting to see how explicit it is, and what sort of demand for an overt stamp of approval from the NSA still exists in the

         Since April, RC6 has being commercially licensed as part of RSA's BSAFE Crypto-C 5.0 and BSAFE Crypto-J 3.0 software developer toolkits. I don't expect that will change.
         (RSA said, however, that by the end of the year its regular support and maintenance procedures will add Rijndael to both of those SDKs. RSA also said it will adopt the AES as "a baseline encryption algorithm" for its Keon family of digital cert products.)
         Given RSA's market share, the eight BSAFE toolkits could be a major channel for distributing AES code to the developer community, particularly among OEMs.          Of the other three who made the finals in this "Crypto Olympics."
MARS, while patented, is available world-wide under a royalty-free license from Tivoli Systems, an IBM subsidiary. (See , although the Tivoli site doesn't seem to have anything but the press release.)
Serpent is public domain, now under the GNU PUBLIC LICENSE (GPL), although Serpent website warns that "some comments in the code still say otherwise." Twofish is "unpatented, and the source code is uncopyrighted and license-free; it is free for all uses."   Suerte,

         I should have been more careful.
         Serpent, per se, has been given over to the public domain.
         What has been released under the more restrictive GPL terms are the optimized Serpent implementations -- by a variety of talented folk, in a variety of useful languages -- which were in the AES submission package. They are now available from the Serpent website at:
         As the website puts it:
"Serpent is now completely in the public domain, and we impose no restrictions on its use. This was announced on the 21st August at the First AES Candidate Conference. The optimised implementations in the submission package are now under the GNU PUBLIC LICENSE (GPL), although some comments in the code still say otherwise. You are welcome to use Serpent for any application. If you do use it, we would appreciate it if you would let us          Sorry if I confused anyone.

> [...] I do not want to buy a complete BSAFE license.
 > It is too expensive and I only need RC4.
         This is apparently a common misconception -- at least it keeps popping up among people discussing WAP, SSL, CDPD, and PPTP-compatible products, even IEEE-compatible embedded systems -- so (in the spirit of All Souls Day) I thought to double back and post a correction here.
         Boo!
         If your business plan (or your boss, or your investors, or your customers, etc.) requires, or makes it useful and valuable, for your firm to license RSA-branded RC4 implementation code -- as opposed using to one of the many copyleft "ARC4" implementations in wide circulation -- you should ask RSA for a quote on a RC4 license for your intended app.
         RSA licenses RC4 code separately, upon request. Always has, AFAIK.
         (RC4 is, of course, MIT Professor Ron Rivest's widely trusted, widely adopted, defacto standardized, variable key-length stream cipher. "RC" was initially only Rivest's personal designation for crypto project in development, as in "Ron's Code."  The best known Rivest ciphers are RC2, RC4, RC5, and RC6.
         (RC4 was reverse engineered and anonymously published on the Net in September, 1994.  The same thing subsequently happened to RC2.  RSA Security, the company Rivest co-founded to market the RSA public key cryptosystem and his other cryptographic wares, later chose to patent RC5 and RC6. Patents for crypto remain controversial, at least on the Net.)
         The idea of paying to use a cryptosystem -- and particularly Rivest's RC4 -- is scary, heretical, and painful to some... but others reportedly find RSA's BSAFE implementation code stable and dependable, and RSA's prices and T&Cs reasonable and flexible.
         YMMV, but RSA does a huge business selling "high assurance" code to OEMs and other firms seeking to implement various crypto protocols and both proprietary and public ciphersuites.  See:          Trick or treat?
         Apparently, even among IT professionals, it is necessary  to occasionally announce that RSA does NOT require an OEM or an enterprise customer to license all the BSAFE ciphers and protocols -- there are, mind you, eight distinct and specialized BSAFE crypto toolkits from RSA -- when all a poor Developer wants is RC4.
         Such is the depth of the FUD piled up around RC4 -- like tinder and faggots stacked at the feet of a condemned witch no one hates enough to          Goblins, gallows, and gibbets, oh yeah!
         (All Hallows Eve is celebrated in the US as Halloween, an annual children's festival held after dark on the last day of October. Children who participate are urged to distinguish between horrors that are real and unreal. The participation of adults in the rituals, unfortunately, is frowned upon.)
         RC4 has become doubly famous as "the cipher none dare name."
         Clank, rattle, clink in the Crypt. Oh yeah!
         While many can now copy the robust simplicity of Rivest's RC4 logic -- and ARC4 ("Apparently RC4") code is widely deployed -- RSA still claims and defends its registered "RC4" trademark (and the copyright on its BSAFE implementation code.)
         Which is, of course, why RSA-branded RC4 code is still so often bought and sold.
         Personally, I don't think that is demonic or even undeserved -- but then, I'm biased. I've been a consultant to RSA for years. (And I'm a wicca'd man at heart. I think the poor witches got a bad rap from all the jealous priests.)
