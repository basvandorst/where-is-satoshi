Probabilistic guarantee is a timeliness guarantee - delivery is still
guaranteed, but the time within which this delivery is made is not
guaranteed. (We could provide a weaker guarantee - say, this will be
delivered before the TCP session times out. However, a complex guarantee
policy might introduce an unacceptable performance hit.) The point is
that round-robin scheduling (as Tor does now) is too easy to predict.
What I suggest does not require changing anything expect the mixing
strategy (which right now is round-robin - no mixing at all). I still
haven't had a chance to look at the mixing code to see if this could be
done with low-enough overhead as to not be noticeable by end-users. I
don't want to make the argument on the performance/penalty tradeoff yet
because I'm hoping there won't be any significant performance hit. I
suspect it's possible, and can only be determined through testing. I'll
report on my progress, if and when when there is some.
