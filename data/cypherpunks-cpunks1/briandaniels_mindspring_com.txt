Try this scenario:  I have 150+ audio cd's, many of which are rare, import,
out of print, or even all of the above.  Since a fire could leave me
missing many pieces of irreplaceable music, I had come up with a plan.  Get
a cd-r burner, make backup copies of my audio discs, and store them in a
safe deposit box.
With this law, my plan would make me a felon somewhere around the 66th
disc.  With the 'victimized' record company getting to create the impact
statement, it might even be sooner.
"But I thought everyone had CD's at the bank!"

Now that's a tasteful bit of humor, if I do say so myself.
It's so nice to know that being lucky enough to be born in the U.S.
authorizes us to look down on and hey, advocate killing those who aren't so

Hey, it beats the stomping of jackboots and shouts of 'Sig Heil!'
Of course, you have an unimpeachable claim, although 'Geiger the III' is a
rather odd last name for an American Indian.
Lets see.  Are you aware of how Texas, California, and New Mexico came to
be part of the US?  Probably doesn't matter - those dang furriners had no
right to the lands they lived on anyway, once the U.S. decided it wanted them.
I don't find it at all surprising that people who live in a 'shithole' want
to leave.  It is easy for you to suggest that they overthrow their
government - after all, you won't be the one facing a Mexican prison.  This is going way off topic at this point, and I am at fault for starting
it.  I was just distressed at how rapidly this list seems to be turning
towards hate and bigotry.  Lets take it to email.
