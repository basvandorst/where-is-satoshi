@_subject: [tor-talk] Got a torrent/link for the leaked Bluecoat ProxySG Virtual Appliance? 
some time ago the Bluecoat ProxySG Virtual Appliance was leaked and you  could get it through most popular torrent trackers. Unfortunately,  nowadays I can't find a single torrent with peers that serve the whole  download. The best I could find will give me the thing till 50%.
Does anyone have a torrent that works? Or can someone that has downloaded the whole thing start seeding again?
