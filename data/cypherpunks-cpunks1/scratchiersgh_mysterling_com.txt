what an adventure it is
she follows me around all day just in case she might be needed for something anything cute little penny is just a wee dog but she feels strongly that part of her duty is to scare the crap out of anyone who gets near our house just so they know no one is going to mess with her family not on her watch she is undeterred by bigger animals and scary men- they all get yelled at to stay away
all kits are shipped phew
well just as we were making preparations to get moving grant was granted that job he wanted right here in utah i guess were staying put (sorry shellie i wanted to live by you and drive to see ray and the beach on weekends real bad)
if you eat like this people will give you crap because its so not trendy anymore but if it will help a woman who would do anything to ovulate and conceive do that (and i know personally quite a few that this was the key for) then who cares what anyone says and jennifer aniston doesnt eat carbs so there
remember how i was so proud that my room was clean and i was knitting well i still am i love all the sweet artistically talented bloggers that offer free downloads around holidays for us readers i went to the fabric store tonight in search of prints to make some new spring scarves with some will probably end up in the shop too i just love this look also i love toast (the catalog and the cooked bread)
say hi to gilbert and the kids with love km
my problem dear anne is that it is 2009 kids dont like to get all fussied up anymore and i dont think they would go to the trouble of making up stories about lost broaches to be able to go to a silly church picnic in my mind the little girls are wearing spring dresses and holding parasols with their gloved hands while the boys are eating biscuits and drinking homemade rootbeer with their hats and suspenders on but i live in a dreamland where i want everything stylized i know you understand me anne
a little note for my valentine
i really really need my bedroom to be simple and uncluttered and white for calming purposes you know what i mean
confession  i miss saved by the bell
cate what did you play on the computer then
even more obsessed with flickr than usual of late
i look for girls with purses that compliment mine
one more thought about best friends
the deal with pcos and carbs
she didnt want to print off her name- signing was a must
