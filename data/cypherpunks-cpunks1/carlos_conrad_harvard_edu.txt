Has anyone heard any developments on the forthcoming Visa "Cash" cards? Release date or other info? (for those who haven't heard of it _is_ anonymous, can be refilled at ATMs. Supposedly in a test release in Atlanta.)
Has any attempt been made to remove the "munitions" classification from cryptographic materials. It seems a lot of our legal difficulties start

sorry i wasn't clear: it is anonymous between the user and the merchant, and between the user and the card distributer (in this case Visa). "Refilling" at ATMs is essentially a download of "cash" from your bank account into the card.
