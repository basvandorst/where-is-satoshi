@_subject: clarification please 
I remember reading a Scientific American article about two years before
Iraq invaded Kuwait, in which it was made clear Iraq had and were
developing missiles with ranges paralleling only U.S., Russia and China. I
don't think harmless and defenseless quite fits the description. Maybe
wannabe super power would be more accurate.

@_subject: Patently Absurd? 
I realize this may seem absurd, but for the sake of humor could there be
any relationship between the Dept. of Justice near pardon of Microsoft on
charges of Anti-trust and the potential adoption of a software encryption
standard in Chicago with the blessing of NIST and some goverment agencies.
Would it be ridiculous conspirancy theorizing to think that MS and Justice
made a deal?
I have nothing to back this up, just reading the news and cypherpunks.
