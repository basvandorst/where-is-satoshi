@_subject: Sony's WWW server (NEWSWAVE) was opened 
Hi, punks,
Sony, our parent company, began to provide several info and
technical support for NEWS users on the WWW server.
# Note that 'NEWS' is Sony's UNIX workstation.
# Mainly, NEWS are used in Japan.
# So, you probably don't know it...
The Home Page is at URL:  (1) The home page of it has large graphics data.
(2) Homepage has some Japanese characters.  So you can not
    read there probably.
If you have time, peek it please.
This home page is NOT the (all of) Sony's home page.
This page is managed by a NEWS support group.

Thanks for your info about _United Kingdom_.  In addition
to it, tell me please about _Japan_ info if you can.
Now I am match interested in crypto-related info about the
US and Japan.  Few weeks ago, I read articles on a Japanese
computer-related biz mag.:
 (1) a software company has imported RSA's BSAFE toolkit,
 (2) the US gov. has eased ITAR reg. off at last month.
If you have more info or more exact info, please tell me.

# will reply when I will return to work.
