This has got to be a hoax, right? The airwaves/ham radio license model really doesn't work in this area! I'd think it was pretty funny, if I didn't have niggling supicion that it might be possible for a gummint mind to think it could work. 5Mhz speed limit? Nominal charge for slowdown crystals? !!! < Tony Iannotti, "SysAdmin"          cc:Mail: Tony_Iannotti at prenhall.com   PTR Prentice Hall                  email: tony at prenhall.com

Well, in Jersey City, NJ, people whose houses get graffitti'd get fined if it's not repainted in a week. Police do not respond to graffitti calls, either. So I think the answer is "all too often."
