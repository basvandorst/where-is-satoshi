Thanks for your help with my story about medical record privacy. Working on the story was a real education for me, (getting to meet
all kinds of interesting people is one of the main reasons why I'm
a reporter) and I had a few good coincidences that added some
"atmosphere" to the piece.  I've included the entire script below.
I hope I'm not being presumptuous.
The show in which my 8.5 minute piece aired is called "The
Communications Revolution, produced by the Telecommunications Radio
Project, which is headquartered at KPFA-FM in Berkeley.  The
project is funded by the California Public Utilities Commission,
through the Telecommunications Education Trust (TET), which is
basically money that was overpaid to Pac Bell by its customers. Other TET grantees are Gregg McVicar's "Privacy Project", and Beth
Given's "Privacy Rights Clearinghouse" in San Diego.  Our project
is a series of 13 one hour, live, satellite- linked panel
discussion and call-in shows that air on about thirty stations
around the country (but especially in California).

by all the gods and goddesses that I will carry out this oath: into whatsoever houses I enter, I will enter to help the sick,

profession, if it be what should not be published abroad, I will
never divulge, holding such things to be holy secrets...."

SINCE THE TIME OF ANCIENT GREECE, DOCTORS HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE
SENSITIVE NATURE OF THEIR PROFESSION, AND HAVE RECITED THIS, THE
HIPPOCRATIC OATH, AS A PROMISE OF CONFIDENTIALITY.  UNTIL
RECENTLY PHYSICIANS HAVE KEPT THE SECRETS OF THEIR PATIENTS IN
THEIR HEADS, OR ON PIECES OF PAPER IN A FILE.  AND THEY'VE BEEN
THE GATEKEEPERS FOR OTHERS WANTING TO SEE THIS EXTREMELY PRIVATE
INFORMATION.  BUT NOW, FOR SOME VERY GOOD REASONS, THAT'S ALL
BEGINNING TO CHANGE.
ONE MAN WHO'S NOT SHY AT ALL ABOUT HIS DATABASE SNOOPING IS JOE
APTER, PRESIDENT OF TELEPHONIC-INFO INCORPORATED OF SAINT
PETERSBURG FLORIDA.  HIS COMPANY ACTUALLY HAS A PRICE LIST OF
INFORMATION YOU CAN OBTAIN: $49 FOR SOMEONE'S SOCIAL SECURITY
NUMBER; $299 WILL GET YOU SOMETHING CALLED A "MEDICAL PROFILE"
THAT APTER WOULDN'T ELABORATE ON, BUT WHICH HE SAYS COMES FROM LEGAL SOURCES...

records on an illegal basis.  And the method they would use to
obtain that would be a pretext into a doctor, and they'd have to
know the doctor, or a pretext in the insurance company to get
that information.  We don't do that.  or: *** alternate cut 11 *** Apter			:24
  in: "You and I are leaving threads as we go around, and we find
those threads and we weave them together to get a picture.  There
are people out there that are providing medical records on an
illegal basis.  We don't do that." *** cut 12 *** Hippocratic oath

under next cut, then up again after next cut.)
*** cut 13 *** Smith                          :22
  in: "I think the answer is for patients to insist that doctors
go back to that ancient ethical standard, and insist that they
not disclose information about them without their informed
consent totally.  The concept of informed consent about the
release of medical information seems to have gotten lost in the
modern age."

@_subject: reporter seeking interview subjects 
Hi, my name is Matt Binder.  Please help me...
        I'm a radio reporter in the SF Bay area working on a series
of pieces about invasions of privacy in the computer age.  I'm
looking for interesting "case studies" that I can use to horrify
my listeners out of their complacency.  My most immediate need is
to find someone whose medical records were used (perused!)
improperly, and/or whose records were incorrect and resulted in
the denial of insurance, employment, loans, adoptions, etc.  But
please also let me know about privacy invasions in other areas
(employer e-mail monitoring, workplace drug testing, credit
problems, weird solicitations, etc.) for future stories.
        I've been a science and technology reporter for ten years,
the first five at KPFA in Berkeley.  This series of reports will
air on a number of different stations and networks including
Pacifica, KPFA, KQED and The Christian Science Monitor radio
                Feel free to circulate this request as you like.
                                                        Thanks, Matt
p.s. I will be really busy until 9/23 so don't give up on me if you
don't hear back right away.
I'm binder at well.sf.ca.us
