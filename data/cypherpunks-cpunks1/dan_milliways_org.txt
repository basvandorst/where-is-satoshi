There must be several versions of the code at this point.  The
Cypherpunks release, Damien's release and whoever else wrote some code
to do the chore.  If someone could pass me a pointer to the version
that's best-commented and most understandable (one man's C is another
man's crypto) I'd like to port it to Windows NT and write a simple
installation to install it as a service.
Crypto++?) would be a good idea.  Just pass a pointers to the
encrypt() and decrypt() functions to use for this session to the
Cracker object, which in turn takes a number of bits and starts
and decrypt functions.  But I suppose it's nothing that couldn't be
overcome with wrapper functions.  Just thinking out loud. :)

According to Biham and Shamir's Differential Cryptanalysis of DES, "An
interesting feature of the new attack is that it can be applied with
the same complexity and success probability even if the key is
frequently changed and thus the collected ciphertexts are derived from
many different keys.  The attack can be carried out incrementally, and
one of the keys can be computed in real time while it is still valid. this is particularly important in attacks on bank authentication
schemes, in which the opponent needs only one opportunity to forge a
multi-million dollar wire transfer, but has to act quickly before the
next key changeover invalidates his message.  This is the first
published attack which is capable of breaking the full DES in less
than the complexity of the exhuastive search of 2^55 keys." (7-8)
of all the required chosen plaintexts.  The analysis phase eats up
2^37 time looking at 2^36 ciphertexts from a universal set of 2^47
chosen plaintexts.  Brute-forcing SSL has a worst-case time complexity
on the order of 2^40.  It appears that complexity for breaking
16-round DES is on the order of 2^37, according to Biham and Shamir.
 The book itself doesn't contain any code, just lots of proofs.  Since
2^40 > 2^37, I think a group effort would be capable of mounting this

I haven't read this entire book, mainly because a lot of it is over my
head with some pretty esoteric proofs.  The impression I got was that
if the cryptanalyst is steadily keeping up with the key changes until
he collects the required 2^36 from a pool of 2^47 valid
plaintext/cyphertext pairs, he then can recover the last key used.  I
don't understand what constitutes a "valid" pair in this context. Also, I'm not sure if all the computation he's done to get to that
point is applicable in his attack on the next key.  It appears not. If all of his precomputation was somehow salvagable, I think we'd
already have heard about someone actually doing it.
be applicable. He'd just have to drop off the computations done for
the first key.  Perhaps the difficulty in this problem comes from not
knowing when the source is changing keys.
you have to encrypt a 1.5Mbits/second data stream of chosen plaintext
for almost three years." (240)  With the massively-parallel nature of
Cypherpunks, this is probably feasible, assuming we could figure out
what needed to be done.
DES can be analyzed in 2^9 using differential cryptanalysis.  Since
I'm sure the press doesn't really understand using multiple rounds in
iterated cryptosystems, maybe that little detail would slip by.  2^9
could easily be handled by an Alpha in the evening.

@_subject: Windows .PWL cracker implemented as a Word Basic virus 
No, but they're doing something that makes me very uncomfortable:  As
I read this, they're hashing the password and some other user
information using MD4 then doing some proprietary permutations on
that.  Given their record with security, I'd rather they used straight
MD4, rather than throwing in something that we can't analyze.
Storage of the Passwords in the SAM Database
User records are stored in the security accounts manager (SAM)
database. Each user has two passwords with which it is associated: the
LAN Manager compatible password and the Windows NT password. Each
password is stored doubly encrypted in the SAM database. The first
encryption is a one-way function (OWF) version of the clear text
generally considered to be non-decryptable. The second encryption is
an encryption of the user's relative ID (RID). The second encryption
is decryptable by anyone who has access to the double-encrypted
password, the user's RID, and the algorithm. The second encryption is
used for obfuscation purposes.
The Windows NT password is based on the Unicode character set, is case
sensitive, and can be up to 128 characters long. The OWF version
(called the Windows NT OWF password) is computed using the RSA MD-4
encryption algorithm, which computes a 16-byte "digest" of a variable
length string of clear text password bytes.

Well, the problem with coming up with plaintext/ciphertext is that
I've never been able to find out exactly where the the SAM database is

@_subject: DES brute force? (was: Re: Borders *are* transparent) 
If we choose a plaintext/ciphertext pair carefully, we can easily save
ourselves some work (50%) while still making the attack a credible
demonstration.  The idea is to use each trial encryption twice.
Shamir note the following, known as the complementation property of DES:
if T = DES(P, K) where T is ciphertext, P plaintext, and k key, then:
T' = DES(P', K') where T', P', and K' are the bitwise complement of the above.
Now the interesting part. If two pairs (P1,T1) and (P2,T2) are available with
P1 = P2' or T1 = T2', then an attacker can restrict his search to only the keys
with LSB = 0.  The attacker runs through the remaining 2^55 keys (with LSB = 0)
and tests the results against both T1 and T2'.  Since testing for equality is
much faster than performing the actual encryption, time savings is on the order
of 50%.
Just a thought on how to save some cycles.
