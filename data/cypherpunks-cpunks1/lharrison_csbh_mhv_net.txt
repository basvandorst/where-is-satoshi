Not surprising at all.  Unbeknownst to most of the general populace, DMV
records (for the most part) are public records and are subject to Freedom of
Information requests.  AAMOF, I have an account with NYS/DMV which I use to
pull my clients' records when they are charged with DWI and/or other traffic
offenses.  I simply dial into DMV's [outdated] computer and pull the record.
It also came in handy on a personal level when I did not get my registration
card after buying my car and discovered that the dealer had not registered
my car.

@_subject: Hackers invade DOJ web site 
I personally found the page to be offensive and disagree highly with the
person having "good taste".
  Following the premise that another posted to this list, there were ways of
focusing on opposing the CDA without insulting women and/or minorities.  I
also agree that this act is going to backfire by giving the DOJ fodder when
the case reaches the Supreme Court.
  IMO, it was patently obvious that it was a kid or kids that did it who
gave no substantial thought on the consequences of his/their act.

You can go to their web page ( click "Just
In" and request via email that your name be removed from their database by
filling out the form.
   Problem, of course, is that one doesn't know if one's name and info is in
the database unless one is a subscriber and can look it up.  I, personally,
do not feel comfortable in filling out a form with my personal info and
sending it along - 1) for the obvious reasons; and 2) what if I'm not even
in their nefarious database?  If not, then I've just entered my personal
info and sent it on its merry way to whomever and wherever unnecessarily -
whether by email, fax, or snail mail.
   I tried just entering my name, email address, and state but, as
anticipated, received a msg that ALL info has to be supplied, so I'll chk
with someone I know that has an account to see if my name is there.
   However, the BIGGEST problem I foresee with this database (and others
like it) is that someone eventually is going to hack it - and then watch the
fun and games ensue.

True.  You *do* have to give your Social Insecurity Number ["SIN"(tm)].
While they have discontinued publishing SIN's, they have them in their
databanks and require you to state it as their way of "verifying" that it is
the "real" you making the request to be removed.
