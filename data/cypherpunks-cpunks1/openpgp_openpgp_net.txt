One has to admit that there is some sweet irony of radical left wingers
voting for Pat Buchanan because they are too dam stupid to figure out the
ballot. Social Evolution at work. LOL!!!

Anyone know  what the law on this is? One would think that they would have
to maintain some type of "chain of evidence" with the ballots.

I think that you find that the Libertarians are smart enough to figure out
a ballot and vote for the candidate that they want. Unfortunatly the same
can't be said for the liberals.

They don't. :)
What is more interesting is the fact the the Judiciary has no enforcement
powers. Jeb Bush can tell them to go screw and there is not a dam thing
that they can do about it.
