Would it be possible to incorporate a ping into the remailer?  Say give it
a list of known remailers for the chain and have it pick one at random,
then ping it. If the remailer responds then send out the mail, otherwise
pick a new remailer, and repeat....
Or this there a flaw in this that I'm just too ignorant to see?

How does this make TA trivial?
I am assuming that batch mailings or staggered mailings are occuring.
The remailers are known locations so any traffic between mailers is
assumed to be observed.  The key is making it impossible to correlate
arrival and departure time of any particular message.  Am I missing

[explanation removed]
ok, this one I can understand to be a problem.  Can anyone beat this?
Well, if the mailer hasn't been announced or made public, then it
obviously won't be on the list of mailers that Remailer is choosing it's
ping targets from.

the everybody: I'm working on a windows shell for PGP, as well as a
pgp.dll for filemanager extensions and supporting drag and drop
encryption.  I say, give me about 1 month or so (I've got a app to deliver
for my real job too) and I'll have stuff that's ready to be tested.  I'll
start accpeting beta test volunteers now if anybody wants to speak up.

Hiya Folks,

I'll do my best have a couple portable formats as well. (RTF, and probably PS)
