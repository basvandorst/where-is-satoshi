@_subject: Digital Telephones in Europe (at least) 
I happened to be talking to a friend who works for a Very Large International Corporation.  He has just been put in charge of managing their new products division.  First on the list is whether and how to become a value added reseller of digital telephones and/or digital telephone services in Europe and evetually worldwide.  They would probably include some financial/transactional services as part of the package.
He is pro-encryption, but not well informed.  What should he insist the telephones have in the way of features? What should he read?  He is not an engineer (he used to be a salesman...) but he's smart. I will summarize emailed replies to the list. Please note that
this ID expires on Dec. 27.

I don't understand this.  Of all the alphabet soup privacy groups out
there, EPIC is the one I consider most pro-privacy and anonymity other
than the ACLU itself.  And EPIC knows the tech better, on the whole
(although the ACLU is quite clued-up too).  It is true that EPIC is not
absolutist on SAFE -- and I'm not quite sure that they are right to give
even the inch they gave to get a mile -- but they're awfully good.
Rotenburg should be a near-hero to most readers of this list.  Instead,
canabalism.   Weird.  Very weird.
That does it.  When I get back to the US, I'm sending EPIC a donation.
