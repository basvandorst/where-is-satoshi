Here are a few programs which haven't been mentioned here before.  They take
C/C++ code and compile it to FPGAs, which might be interesting to someone
who's working on, oh, say RC5...
The first is at and compiles C code to Xilinx or Altera FPGAs.
Another is at ftp://lslsun5.epfl.ch/pub/nlc*
It uses a slightly different syntax and targets Xilinx chips.
There's also a routing optimizer at
 gives plans for building a programmer to
load designs into Altera FPGAs.
While I not sure how well-optimized the output from such software is, it
is interesting to note that someone with relatively basic electronics and
computer programming experience could put together a massively parallel
