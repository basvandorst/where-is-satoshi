Note that if the user can modify the wallet, a "fat, dumb, and happy"
implementation may be vulnerable to the following attacks.
Attack 1:
(1) Withdraw $0.01 from the bank.
(2) Change a random bit in the encrypted wallet.  (Picking the bit to
change will be easier if the storage format in known.)
(3) Fire up the application as see how much money you have.
Attack 2:
(1) Withdraw many $$$ from the bank.
(2) Copy the wallet.
(3) Deposit the $$$ back in the bank.
(4) Restore the wallet using the copy.
While there are certainly ways to notice modifications to the wallet, and
prevent the replay attack, they result in considerable additional
complexity for what was a very simple implementation

There is a common example of this corner case where the memory is paged.
The page containing the key is swapped out, then it is read back in and the
key is overwritten, and then the page is deallocated.  Many OSs will not
zero the disk copy of the key.
Crypto coders have discussed many kludges to ensure that keys are not
swapped out, but they are all quite system specific.  Since the problem we
were trying to solve is different environments producing different results,
I don't feel we are any closer to safe, portable code.

The Scottish land clearances are an interesting case study here.  For
generations before 1745, the scots lived in clans where the clan leaders
depended on landless peasants for agricultural labor and private armies.
After the Jacobite revolution, with Bonnie Prince Charlie's claim to the
throne, the government tried to suppress the highland clans, banned the
private armies, the playing of bagpipes, and the wearing of highland dress.
Clan leaders no longer needed the peasants for private armies, and their
tenancy became a financial burden.  At the same time, the introduction of
the potato allowed the population of peasants depending on the clans for
support to almost double.
These changes, along with increased economic value of wool and mutton,
caused the land owners to shift their lands to sheep production.  The
peasants were either moved to small holdings on the poorest land (called
crofts), or shipped abroad.  Modern historians estimate that between 50,000
and 100,000 people were removed from the land during the 19th century.
The clearances did not proceed without protest, and there were frequent
tenant uprisings.  However, nothing in Scottish law prevented land lords
from clearing their land.  In 1886, the government passed the Crofter's
Holding Act which provided for security of tenure, fair rents, and the
crofter's right to pass the croft through inheritance.  On May 3, 2000, the
Scottish parliament abolished feudal tenure, ending 900 years of feudalism.
[Source: The Lonely Planet, Scotland's Highlands & Islands guidebook]
Now for the questions:
Who owned the land?  The lords?  The peasants?  Someone else?
What does it mean to own land?
Are land owners justified in evicting people who have lived on, and worked
the land for generations?

@_subject: Responding to orders which include a secrecy requirement 
The Java Anonymous Proxy (JAP) service, your local library, and you, among
others need to develop a response should you be served with an order (court
or otherwise) to produce information which includes the requirement that
you keep the order secret.
There are a large number of responses one could use.  Some of them might be:
* Cooperate.
* Take the service down.
* Publicly refuse to cooperate.
* Publicly announce that you are being monitored.
* Stop saying that the service is not monitored.
* Appear to cooperate, but provide false information.
* etc.
Please keep in mind when reading the following analysis that I am not a lawyer.
Cooperation seems to be the safest from a short term legal standpoint.
However, to the extent it encourages the police state, it is dangerous in
the long term.
Taking the service down is an obvious response.  It is a difficult response
for your public library to implement.  In addition, a strict enough secrecy
order could require you to keep the service up.
Publicly refusing to cooperate is the most honorable response, and will
probably end you up in jail for an indefinite term on contempt charges.
This is the path of civil disobedience, followed by a number of heros in
past encounters with totalitarianism.
Publicly announcing that you are being monitored will probably end up with
the same contempt charges as a public refusal to cooperate, coupled with
the possibility of the dishonorable act of breaking your word (depending on
your terms of service).
Stopping your notification that the service is not monitored can be
forbidden by a strict enough secrecy order.  It may be the least legally
risky of the options.  The fact that you will stop notification should be
included in your terms of service.
Providing false information is an interesting option, but I think you are
legal toast if you are caught doing it.  One can get a lot of amusement
from considering who to implicate in place of the real anonymous user.

I've spent some time recently looking at Voice over IP (VoIP)
implementations.  My immediate reaction to reading the standards is that
they a complete answer to a telephone company executive's wet dreams.
Conferencing, Automatic call forwarding, Billing etc. etc., they're all
covered.  The result is a protocol that is beyond baroque and well into
rococo.  I think the various standards bodies are still trying to deal with
issues in the protocols that weren't thought of from the start.
Of course, once you have your call set up, you have to encrypt it.  Most of
the VoIP implementations use Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP, RFC2326),
which requires two UDP ports through your firewall.  Then you have to
encrypt the RTSP traffic.  I have seen reference to an encryption protocol
specifically for RTSP, but a quick scan of STD1 didn't turn it up, so it is
probably still a draft.  I don't know anything about its security.
The other choice is IPSec.  IPSec seems happiest securing traffic between
machines with permanent IP addresses.  It is a nightmare to use with
Network Address Translation.
What would be really nice would be a VoIP system that used TCP instead of
UDP.  (I know that if TCP goes into error recovery, there is going to be
major jitter in the voice.  I know it will be hard to support conferencing.
I know it will not gracefully bridge to the POTS network.  Etc. I'm willing
to put up with that to avoid the pain that comes with UDP.)  Then I can
just tunnel it through SSH, or hack it to use SSL/TLS.  Oh well.

Java is certainly an improvement for buffer overruns.  (The last estimate I

applications.  However Java is being used for server-side scripting with

Perhaps there is a reason that the 5th amendment provided for eminent
domain.  And, given the government camel nose under the tent, how far do
you let it in?  It would be nice to introduce some competition to keep
CalTrans honest.  OTOH, I like the low transaction costs, and the
reasonably accurate allocation of cost that go with a fuel tax based road
system.  (The heavier vehicles use more gas, are harder on the roads, and
pay more per mile.  The people who drive more, pay more tax.  That seems
roughly fair.  OTOH, it's not clear that the current system builds roads
where they are most needed.  And there is undoubtedly waste in the system.
The computer system scandals come immediately to mind.)
Perhaps if some of the gas tax was allocated to support the private toll
roads, perhaps a percentage of mileage carried...  Of course that approach
would work best for maintenance, not construction, which is a more of a
gamble on future behavior.

(2) Check it against the local database of already seen coins.  (Because
Bloom filters can give false positives.)  If it is in the database, drop
the mail and the connection.  Result: no mail in the spool, and minimum
bandwidth lost.
(collect) Add the coin to the Bloom filter and to the database.  Collect
the money from the bank.  If the bank says, "double spent", drop the
connection and the mail as above.
Note that this system will work well against spammers who blast out
identical coins to a lot of addresses at an ISP.
Now spammers can engage in a DOS attack against this system by using junk
coins.  It won't help them get the spam thru, and it will be detected when
there is a TCP connection between their machine/open relay/etc. and the ISP
machine.  That will go a long way toward locating them in meat space, so
fraud charges can be brought.

OK, It wasn't clear (at least to me) that you were starting from a random
seed to generate the hash cash.
Note that ISPs could look for duplicate hashcash tokens on the input to
their mail transfer agents, and save the disk and bandwidth for duplicates.
It would be basically the same algorithm I proposed for collecting
micropayments.  (The couldn't check for the correct addressee because of
facilities like .forward, but they could eliminate duplicates.)

This description is remarkably like the description of Jewel Cave (National
Monument) when Herb and Jan Conn start exploring in the 1960s.  The park
wanted them to find a connection between two passages that separated close
to the entrance so they could run tour groups that didn't have to pass each
other in the narrow passages.
In 1969, there were 54 miles of passage mapped, and still no connection.
It is now over 127 miles, and still no connection.

In the spirit of I. F. Stone...
Buried in the last paragraphs of an article in yesterday's San Jose Mercury
News (Thursday, May 15) that starts out talking about members of congress
saying that the US is ill-prepared to defend against an attack on critical
computer systems is the following gem.
"Last fall's legislation authorized the National Science Foundation to
spend $110.25 million on cyber-security research, but the agency is
requesting only about $51 million.  DARPA's unclassified budget for
cyber-security research has actually declined, from about $90 million in
2000 to $30 million in 2003.  But Tether [Tony Tether, director of DARPA]
said those figures were misleading, because more projects are now
classified.  He estimated the agency will spend about $100 million on
cyber-security research in 2004."
Note also that DARPA's support of the OpenBSD project has been dropped (see
Do these changes mean that the US is trying to protect "critical
infrastructure" using classified techniques so other nation's systems can
be hacked while US ones are safe?  Inquiring minds want to know.

I think your best bet for an 8 bit CPU will be an assembly language
routine.  These processors normally include the carry/borrow out of the
high order bit in a status register.  An assembly routine can use that bit
to efficiently implement multiple precision arithmetic, which can, in turn,
be used to implement modexp.

You probably don't have to read all 256 bits.  One way this had been
handled (in the Starium (sp?) phone), is to display a number derived from
the hash.  One person reads the first half of the number, and the other
person reads the second half.  If both halves verify, there is no
man-in-the-middle.  The length of the number determines the security, but
since it is derived from the Diffie-Hellman exchange, neither side can
control its value.  Probably 6 digits is enough.
Cache entries would be a way for someone who obtains the phone to be able
to trace your contacts.  (So would a in-phone address book.)  Automatic
authentication also might make it easier to spoof the phone's owner.

@_subject: e voting 
David Chaum has described a system where each voter gets a piece of paper
which includes their vote, encrypted so they can't prove how they voted.
The images of these pieces of paper are also posted on a web page, so the
voters can look up their encrypted ballots to verify that their votes are
being counted.  These votes are passed through a number of mixes, which may
be run by different organizations before they are completely decrypted and
counted.  (The mixes prevent a decrypted ballot from being associated with
an input, encrypted ballot.)  The encryption of the ballots is performed by
over-printing the plain-text ballots, so the voter can verify the ballot's
correctness before it is encrypted.  The mixes are verified by random
inspection.  This system seems to meet the above requirements.
Now, I can think of some ways to cheat with this system, but they are all a
lot more likely to be found than cheats with the current systems.
The big knock on all-electronic voting machines is that they are a step
backwards in independent verification and audit from paper ballots, or even
punch cards.  (Yes, you can argue about hanging chad, pregnant chad,
dimpled chad etc., but at least you have something tangible that represents
each ballot.)
The saving grace of the old mechanical voting machines is that they are
mechanical, and hard to modify for cheating.  Most anyone on this list can
imagine the program in an electronic voting machine being different from
the one that was audited and approved.  That's hard to do with a mechanical
system.  We have seen failures where the mechanical systems lost all the
votes made on them however, a failure that seems possible with the
electronic systems as well.
IMHO, the problem with Chaum's systems is that it is complex.  I think that
saving a printed paper ballot, along with the electronic totals, gives much
the same level of security and assurance, with a system that the average
voter can understand.

It depends on what happens to the receipt when you say commit.  It could
automatically go into the ballot box without delay, so you can't take such
a photo.
I expect that Vinny is already doing this with video of the touch screen
verification screen and the voter pressing OK, but he hasn't make me an
offer yet.  I expect he gets better value for his money with TV ads, and
last minute hit mailers.

Mark Miller pointed out to me that currently much of our protection from
viruses comes from people at the anti-virus companies who quickly grab each
new virus, reverse engineer it, and send out information about its payload
and effects.  Any system which hides code from reverse engineering will
make this process more difficult.  To the extend that Palladium/TCPA/NGSCB
hides code, and to the extent it succeeds at this hiding, the more it
encourages new and more pervasive viruses.

One area we are not addressing in voting security is absentee ballots.  The
use of absentee ballots is rising in US elections, and is even being
advocated as a way for individuals to get a printed ballot in jurisdictions
which use electronic-only voting machines.  Political parties are
encouraging their supporters to vote absentee.  I believe that one election
in Oregon was recently held entirely with absentee ballots.
For classic polling place elections, one strength of an electronic system
which prints paper ballots is that there are two separate paths for the
counts.  The machine can keep its own totals and report them at the end of
the election.  These totals can then be compared with the totals generated
for that precinct by counting the paper ballots.  This redundancy seems to
me to provide higher security than either system alone.
