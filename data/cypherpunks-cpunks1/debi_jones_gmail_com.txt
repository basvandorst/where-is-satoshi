The most lethal phone is one that hits your head with enough force to crack
your skull.
The precision of cellid is location specific as it depends on cell size.  It
depends on the arrangement and distance between the towers being used to
locate you.  Think geometry.  The longer the sides of a triangle the greater
the area.
That fellow might have been a GSM expert but clearly he wasn't an LBS or
CDMA expert.  One major benefit for current CDMA networks using cellid is
that the base stations operate synchronously.  They emit code sequences at
exactly the same time, so there's no need for after collection
synchronization as is the case for GSM.
