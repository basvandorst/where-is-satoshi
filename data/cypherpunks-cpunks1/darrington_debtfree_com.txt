@_subject: Debt-Freedom! 
Hi, Living in today's world with all the high-tech toys is great. Who ever thought the internet would be such an attraction... I never did. I love the internet, and I love meeting new people, but I have found it even a better place to be since I have found that becoming debt-free has allowed me so much freedom.
I know that many families are drowning in debt... living pay check to pay check. I have found a program I would like to tell you about that could make you debt-free, including your mortgage.. in about 5 years, All on the income you earn now!
If you are interested in becoming Debt-Free on your current income (yep, no sales work, no extra job, nothing special to join, no soap, pills, powders, or door selling involved, and it's all GUARANTEED by an Inc. 500 Company) Contact me and I will send you a FREE information package via e-mail that will start you on your way to True Financial Freedom!

God Bless,

Hello Team Members,
  The following is a new company offering Internet services on the Web.It's free to sign up for the pre-launch. You are not obligated to become a member it is simply designed to allow you to make a descision on the package when the complete details are released in March. I think it's a nice way to find people interested in this MLM Internet service concept. When someone signs up under you you receive an e-mail telling you they signed up for more info in March.
 Check out the Web site when you have time.
