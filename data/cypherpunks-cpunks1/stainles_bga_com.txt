@_subject: DES for HP48? 
When the RC4 implimentation for the HP48 was posted, someone else mentioned
the existence of a DES implimentation for the same machine. I remember
seeing this mentioned on the list earlier as well, but...
I've done searches with Archie, Alta Vista and Yahoo, as well as looking
through the excellent hks.net archives, but I haven't been able to find it.
Can someone point me in the right direction?
(Since I'm probably just too stupid to construct a proper Yahoo search, and
to keep list noise down, I'll sumarize privately e-mailed responses.)

Public thanks to The Cunning Artificers who sent a response (by the ECafe
anonymous remailer) pointing to
for the HP48 DES implimentation.
Apologies to everyone else for the extra noise.

Nicholas Petreley's "Down To the Wire" column is a short take on the
insecurity of encryption schemes used by most commercial software.
There shouldn't be much new here to cypherpunks (he discusses the
vulnerabilities of WordPerfect, Word for Windows, Excel, and Compuserve's
CIS.INI, and uses some out of date examples "to protect the integrity of
current software": bad move, Nicholas), but it'd make a good introduction
for people who aren't familiar with the issues.
Petreley also announces that InfoWorld is planning a "network-cracking
event", in which they plan to set up various network OS'es, make them as
secure as they can, invite "a small number of accomplished hackers" to
attack them, and publish the results. He says they're looking for
