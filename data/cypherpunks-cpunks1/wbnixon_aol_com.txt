@_subject: CDR: Complete Guidebook and Workplace Violence Prevention Video series 
Good Morning! I am Barry Nixon, Executive Director, The National Institute for the Prevention of Workplace Violence and am creating a workplace violence superstore on line with the intent to have a wide array of workplace violence prevention products for sale.  Your video series would be an excellent addition to the online superstore so could you  please send me information about the steps necessary to make this happen.
I can be contacted via email at WBNixon at AOL.com, telephone at 949-770-5264 and fax 949-597-0977.
