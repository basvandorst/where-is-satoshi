@_subject: About Triple DES ...... 
Please let me know if TRIPLE DES is regulated by the same rules than the others criptography systems in USA.
   We want to use it here in National Autonomous University of Mexico, so we don't want to get jailed.
   In case we can use it somebody knows where can i get the source code ??
   I have searched this already in WWW, archie and Veronica.
Thanks in advance.
