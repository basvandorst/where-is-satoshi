@_subject: UNSUBSCRIBERS PLEASE READ 
Actually, most mailing lists are run by machines, not human beings, at least for routine administrative tasks.  Especially for such things as subscribing and unsubscribing.
I too attempted to unsubscribe a couple days ago, largely because the noise posts are not filtered.  There are plenty of list managing software packages out there, which aren't difficult to install.  I suggest anyone planning on running a mailing list look into them; machines were made to do repetitive tasks.
