"Collateral damage" occurs in any battle. If you hold the battle in
Switzerland the "collateral damage" would simply include a higher "loss of

The real issue is the fact that the battle takes place.
Protestors don't gather and put their personal well-being at risk for no
reason. In the case of those protesting in Genoa, the reasons are varied but
centered around a single point: globalization and big government has not
helped the people. Money doesn't matter; government doesn't matter; people
do matter. The people have not been helped by the forces of globalization.
The people have not been helped by the World Bank, IMF, G8. That is, the
people that populate the cities and farm the countryside. The elite few % of
the people who control the world, via government and corporations, exploit
the rest of the world for their benefit. G8 is just one of their tools. They
are helped by the World Bank. They are the ones being opposed by the
protestors. They will be made accountable for their actions--these battles
will not end.
Revolutions and Civil Wars have occurred regularly for hundreds of years
over this very issue. This war has simply escalated to the scale that is has

Prompt Number 1
Angry Inside and No One Cares
Look at the children of two recent shootings.  One was a young child who was not involved in sports and was constantly picked on, the other was a four or five member group who were said to be outcasts in their school and were also not involved in sports.  In both these cases the youths had active friends, but were not involved in any active activities.
Youths are also going through a stage in their life were they need people to pay attention, yet today society is trying to turn children into robots and statistics.  Looking at the rule books for a local grade school you would think they are supposed to replace a bible.  Children today are even restricted in what games they play, who they talk to, and how to dress.  At the same time children are hearing about how to their community they are just numbers.  They spend over a month preparing and taking tests so they can show the authority how much they know.  Children desire to be involved and paid attention to.    A third factor to the rise in school shootings could be that before youths would try to commit acts of extreme violence by suicide, small bombs, or destroying property.  Today children see that shootings and gun related violence are a huge media hype events.  They feel that by shooting another kid they could gain an extreme amount of attention to themselves or their situation.  They know that people will remember their actions.  Their horrible acts are more easily recalled then state capitals.  Where was the last shooting?  What is the capital of Alabama?
Society must learn that children will be aggressive.  They will release their anger, but it does not have to be in such a spectacular fashion.  Parents need to talk to their children and play a ACTIVE role in their life.  Society needs to stop treating children as a collective group of autonomous beings, but as a diverse group of individuals.  And we as a nation need to show then that yes, we care for you as an individual.   48d`$da$d8 1h/ =!" at 8NormalCJ_HaJmH	sH	tH	<A Paragraph Font8$45STR	4:0000000000008	88:DE:35SQTY							37:Valued Sony CustomerMC:\WINDOWS\Application Data\Microsoft\Word\AutoRecovery save of Document1.asdValued Sony Customer8C:\WINDOWS\Desktop\DeVry\English 110\Compentency III.doc at UnknownG:Times New Roman5Symbol3&:Arial"hT2T+@	!20d\2 Security Number: 326-70-5214Valued Sony CustomerValued Sony CustomerOh+'0	8D`l

@_subject: Signing as one member of a set of keys 
Steps to verify the "ring signature" file (note: you must have the openssl
library installed):
1. Save as text, to the file ringsig.c.  Delete the paragraph of explanation, and/or any
HTML junk, so the file starts with:
 *  * by Rivest, Shamir and Tauman
and it ends with:
 */
2. The "[...]" above is where a remailer caused some of the signature
to be stripped out.  Replace the last few lines of ringsig.c with the
text from
This has the lines from the END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK line onward.
The last lines of the ringsig.c file should be:
 */
3. Compile ringsig.c using the openssl library, to form an executable file
"ringsig".  Try running ringsig and you will get a usage message.
4. Get the two perl scripts from
and save them as "ringver" and "ringsign".
5. Run the ringsig.c file through the "pgp" program to create a PGP key
ring file from the PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK data.  With the command line
version of PGP 2.6.2 the command is:
pgp -ka ringsig.c sigring.pgp
This will also show you the set of keys, one of which made the signature.
*** COULD SOMEONE PLEASE FOLLOW THE STEPS ABOVE AND PUT THE ringsig.c,
ringsign, ringver, AND sigring.pgp FILES ON A WEB PAGE SO THAT PEOPLE
CAN DOWNLOAD THEM WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH ALL THESE STEPS? ***
6. Finally, the verification step: run the ringver perl script, giving the
PGP key file created in step 5 as an argument, and giving it the ringsig.c
file as standard input:
./ringver sigring.pgp < ringsig.c
This should print the message "Good signature".
7. How do you know what this means?  For that you have to read the paper
referenced in the program to become convinced of the theory, and then to
study the program to be convinced that it implements the algorithm in the
8. To create your own signatures, create a PGP keyring file which holds
your own key as well as the keys of other people that you want people to
think might have issued the signature.  They must all be RSA public keys.
Create a PGP secring.pgp file which holds just your secret key, and change
your passphrase on that key to be blank.  (This is temporary, you can
change it back or delete the secring.pgp when you are done.)  Then use
the ringsign perl script:
"./ringsign filetosign pubkeyfile privkeyfile > outfile"
This will append a signature to the file you are signing.  You also need
to make sure the recipient knows the pubkeyfile, so you may want to send
that separately, or include it in the file being signed as was done in
this case.
9.  Please report whether you were able to succeed, and if not, which step
failed for you.  BTW there are a couple of papers on ring signatures to
be presented at Crypto 02 so there might be some new improvements coming
to the code if the ideas look good.  One possibility is extending them
to work with DSS keys in addition to the current RSA keys.

The latest release of Mixmaster claims to be an "OpenPGP enhancement

to either pgp or gnupg.
This got me thinking - has anyone tried hacking mixmaster to be a pgp
client?  I have compiled it under DOS before, so I know that is possible.
Does anyone know if mixmaster can use 'non-legacy' RSA keys?  Is there any
pgp functionality that it lacks?  I am looking for a pgp implementation that

@_subject: Discouraging credential sharing with Mojo 
Some credential issuing schemes, such as those from Brands as well as from
Camenisch & Lysyanskaya, try to avoid credential sharing by embedding
into the credential some secret which is important and valuable to the
credential holder.  Then if the credential is shared, the recipient
learns the important secret, to the detriment of the person sharing
the credential.  So he won't do it.
The problem is that there don't seem to be any secrets that will work
well in discouraging sharing.  The most obvious is a credit card number,
but this has a number of problems: some people don't have credit cards;
people could cancel their credit cards after receiving the credentia;
and underground hackers have access to thousands of stolen credit card
numbers that they don't mind sharing.
Clearly we need a new approach.  Here is a suggestion for a simple
solution which will give everyone an important secret that they will
avoid sharing.
At birth each person will be issued a secret key.  This will be called
his Mojo.  He will also get the associated public key which will assist
in protocols which involve commiting to his Mojo.  The public key can
be revealed but the Mojo should be kept secret at all costs.
Then in a credential issuing protocol, the user embeds his Mojo into
his credential in a provable way.  It is important that the protocol
not reveal the Mojo to the issuer, but rather that some kind of zero
knowledge proof be used so that the issuer is confident that sharing
the credential will reveal the Mojo.
Now all that is needed is a simple change to the law so that knowing
someone's Mojo makes him your slave.
That is, if you know someone's Mojo you own him.  You get access to all
his money and all his assets.  You can force him to work for you and
take all he earns.  You can mistreat and even kill him.  If he tries to
escape, the Runaway Mojo Slave act will commit the government to tracking
him down and returning him to you.
With this small change to the law, everyone will be gifted with an
important secret which they can use to bind and commit themselves in
a variety of protocols.  By embedding their Mojo into their secret
credentials, they can assure the credential issuer that the credential
won't be shared.  Mojo can also serve as an "is a person" credential
and allow for secure electronic voting and other protocols where each
person should only participate once.
Please join me in supporting this important reform.
Just say, "I want my Mojo!"

@_subject: Libertarian Party versus Cosmopolitan Party 
I have been a libertarian for many years because it was the most pro-
freedom political movement available. But I have come to the
realization that even with a libertarian president and administration,
we are all dead.
Libertarianism is good; do not get me wrong. But because it is a
pragmatic party and not grounded in unmovable principles, it can and
has been penetrated by cryptically anti-freedom individuals: "socialist
libertarians," "environmental libertarians," and so on. The few
loopholes in libertarianism leave the door open to professional
manipulators called neocheaters who will continue usurping the value
producers and block biological immortality from rising in America.
January 1, 2002 is the official birth date of the Cosmopolitan Party.
This party is fully anchored in rock-solid principles of liberty. Its
political platform is an irresistible matrix of reality and honesty --
arising from reason and common sense -- all grounded in unassailable
reality. Thus, neither its candidates nor its adherents can debase it
with compromises on the most basic issue of liberty: individual rights.
Like looking into a crystal ball, the future becomes starkly clear to
anyone who peruses this platform. There is no alternative but the
liberation of all value producers in the United States, enabling market-
driven science to develop human immortality without interference by
anyone. Furthermore, this party's sound fiscal strategy will increase
the real wealth of all US citizens. We can add huge chunks of time and
money to our lives via the Cosmopolitan Party -- perhaps a 25% increase
in longevity by 2007 and a 33% increase in purchasing power by 2008.
As a side note, Omar and Osama are false targets. They are decoys,
foils. Khartoum and Tehran are the real centers of international
terrorism. By penetrating fifty countries within a few months, the
Cosmopolitan Party will become the religious-terrorists' worst
nightmare. Freedom and prosperity lovers, on the other hand, will learn
that the Cosmopolitan Party is a dream come true.

Woman videotaped hitting child has local ties
By MELODY McDONALD
Star-Telegram Staff Writer
FORT WORTH - The woman captured on videotape beating a child in an Indiana
department store parking lot last week is believed to be an Irish Traveller
with ties to the Fort Worth area.
Madelyne Gorman, 25, also known as Madelyn Toogood, has been the subject of
a nationwide search since Indiana law enforcement authorities distributed
copies of the videotape to the media earlier this week.
Gorman, who is believed to be affiliated with a Traveller group in White
Settlement and Fort Worth known as the Greenhorn Carrolls, is also wanted on
unrelated warrants in White Settlement and Fort Worth, authorities said.
Irish Travellers are descendants of a nomadic ethinic group that came to the
U.S. in the 1800s to escape the potato famine, roaming the country by horse
and wagon in search of itinerant work. Shiny trucks and travel-trailers now
carry them to the nation's distant corners and unassuming places like White
They are devout Roman Catholics who share biblical names, marry within the
group and speak their own dialect. Most of the men make their living in
home-improvement and business-repair work, such as paving, painting and
Law enforcement authorities said some scam their clients in the process.
Joe Livingston, a senior agent with the South Carolina Law Enformcemnt
Division who has investigated Travellers for 18 years, said there are
various subclans of Irish Travellers around the cournty.
"In Texas, they are the Greenhorn Carrolls. The South Carolina Travellers
are known as the Georgia Boys. In Memphis, they are known as the Mississippi
travellers. This girl appears to be a branch of Texas."
"How many are there?" he asked. "Who knows."
The Greenhorn Travellers -- the Carrolls, Gormans, McDonalds, Daleys and
Jennings -- found themselves in the spotlight in January 2000 when five of
their young members were killed in a wreck on Interstate 30 in Fort Worth.
The accident -- one of the worst in city history -- shocked the public.
Questions arose when authorities learned that none of the boys was older
than 14 and four of them were carrying false driver's licenses
misrepresenting their ages.
After the accident, some Traveller families withdrew their children from
area schools. Victims' families met with investigators only once.
Livingston, who is researching the Madelyne Gorman case, said he has
discovered that Gorman has driver's licenses in Indiana, Missiouri, Texas
and New Jersey. Computer searches reveal she has listed addresses in Mission
and Fort Worth; Elkhart, Ind.; and Independence, Mo., among others.
"This again, shows the transiency of these people," said Livingston, who
said he received a call from an informant Friday morning about the case. "My
guy says they've gone underground. They're not going to find this girl." In
addition to the arrest warrant out of Indiana, Gorman is wanted in White
Settlement and Fort Worth for unrelated crimes.
In White Settlement, a warrant was issued for Gorman's arrest on April 9
after she failed to pay a $202 traffic ticket. According to the city's
municipal court clerk, Gorman received a citation for no driver's license on
Dec. 12, 2001, in the 1400 block of south Cherry Lane.
The following month, Fort Worth police issued a warrant for Gorman's arrest
after she failed to appear in court to face theft charges, said Lt. Mack
West, of the Tarrant County Sheriff's Department.
According to a computer records and a Fort Worth police report, Gorman and
another woman, Rose Ann Carroll, were arrested March 27 at a Kohls
department store in Fort Worth on charges of theft $50 to $500.
