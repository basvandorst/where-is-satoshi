@_subject: The FIREWALL CHIP. U're phone always offhook? 
Actually, there is a germ of truth in this.  On older phones (don't know if this works on newer electronic phones) when the handset is 'on-hook' a switch opens and breaks the voice circuit.  This of course only works for DC circuits.  If you drive that same circuit with an AC signal (from further up the line) then that 'open' switch becomes a capacitor and acts as a band-pass filter.  Signals from the mic will then modulate that AC current and can be extracted and reconstructed.  Supposedly the Dutch police have perfected this and use it in investigations to circumvent legal restrictions on physically bugging suspects homes; or so was alleged a couple of years ago during a narcotics trial in Amsterdam.

@_subject: USPO & Digital Postage/E-Cash Project 
The US Post Office just killed a project that would have created a digital postage/e-cash system.  This would have been a digital replacement for the Pitney-Bose style Postage Metering machines.  To use a PM machine one has to take the entire machine physically to a Postal Station and purchase some fixed dollar amount of postage.  The Postal clerk unseals and unlocks the machine, dials in the amount of postage purchased and then relocks and reseals the machine.  This mechanical system would have been replaced by a serial-port dongle and a piece of software.  The dongle would contain an EEPROM in a replacable button (made by Dallas Semiconductor) into which would be loaded data indicating the amount of postage that had been purchased and not yet used.  The software package would be able to print the address, postage seal, routing codes, etc directly on the envelope via a laser printer and decrement the amount of available postage left in the dongle.  In the original test, customers would have to take the dongle to a Postal Station to purchase additional postage, but the ultimate goal was to have been to have a commerical dial-up service available that one could dial into and purchase additional postage directly. A proof-of-concept prototype was developed in VB and a production prototype was then developed in VC++.  Unfortunately the crypto wasn't very strong.  The USPO contracted with Carnege-Mellon to try and break the system and they were able to within a couple of weeks.  USPO then killed the project.

"Government Tackles a Surge of Smut on the Internet"
Wall Street Journal

  Instead, the services would prefer to be treated like phone companies, which claim no responsibility for telephone conversations. With millions of messages passing through each day, the services say couldn't possibly monitor everything even if they tried.
  Sen. Exon is unconvinced. "If I were against this , if I didn't want to be bothered with it, if I felt it might complicate my ability to make money on the superhighway, that's the argument I would make," he says, adding that a failure by the government to act would be "an open invitation to some of the hardcore pornography getting into our homes."

If one wonders what sort of physical threat an operator of a datahaven could potentially face, then today's (01/10/95) Wall Street Journal editorial is must reading.  It's on the Op-Ed page (page A20) and is titled: "No Accountability at the FBI".  It discusses the Randy Weaver siege in 1992 and the subsequent investigation and whitewash that followed.  It's scary stuff!

Won't work!  You can always embed an encrypted message in what 'looks' like plaintext.  A trivial example: Encrypt a message with a caesar cypher, then build a story where the first char of each word maps to each subsequent char from the encrypted text.  At the cost of expanding the size of the message by a factor of 5 to 10 you've hidden the encrypted message in what looks like a letter to your mother (or a news story in the NY Times, etc.)  This is old technique.

The discussion was one of whether you could distinguish plaintext from cyphertext by doing a statitical analysis of the datastream, i.e. can you tell one from the other without actually reading each message. The answer is no.

It's an artificial example, but one that points out that merely doing a frequency analysis on the datastream isn't enough to guantee the correct answer.  Reliable remailer software will have to worry about false postives as well as false negatives; especially if it's a fee-for-service operation.
This might also be a nice feature if you're trying to dodge an NSA filter.
Of course the implicit assumption in that statement is that encrypted traffic hasn't been outlawed or regulated, or that the sender doesn't want to 'appear' to be sending encrypted traffic.

Just a technical note, but a normal distribution of digits (i.e. 'no digit more frequent than any other') is no inidication of either randomness or 'good' encryption.  A better test is to look for a normal distribution at all scale levels.  For example, the following text block: "UUU" (in ASCII) has a normal distribution at the bit level "0101 0101 0101 0101 0101 0101",
but not at the byte level.

I'm still not making my point.  Encryption is not a data 'state' that can be tested for in the way that liquid/solid/vapour are states of matter.  Encryption is a data 'interpretation' for which there are an arbitrairly large number of interpretations available for any given dataset. There is no algorithmic test that can applied to a dataset that will be able to establish the existance or non-existance of a given interpretation.  If you're given an unkown dataset and are asked the question, 'Is this an image file' or 'Is this an encrypted file' or 'Is this an audio clip', there is no algorithmic test that can answer any of these questions in either the affermative or the negative.  This is just an alternate phrasing of Goedel's Undecidability Theorem.  This problem lies permanantly outside the outer boundary of algorithmic Let me now spin a little tale as to how this affects an operator of a re-mailer or datahaven.  This tale has two characters, Paco the child pornogropher and Eric the honest RM/DH operater.  Paco begins by inventing the new 'Foolproof Barometric Graphic Image Format' (aka FooBar GIF) of which only Paco knows the internals.  A FooBar GIF has a statistical profile that looks remarkably like a PGP file, in fact it even comes with a PGP header!  Nothing illegal here.  Now Paco writes a FooBar GIF Viewer which he sales to child-porn types. Again, there's nothing illegal about the sale of such a piece of software.  Paco now anonymously loads Eric's DH with lots of child-porn FooBar GIF's via Eric's anon-RM.  These files of course sail right through Eric's filters with nary a scratch.  As far as Eric knows he's holding PGP encrypt files.  Now Paco advertises the availability of lots of 'good' picture on Eric's DH that can be used with the newly purchased FooBar GIF Viewers.  Then the cops get ahold of one of Paco's FooBar GIF Viewers and downloads some FooBar GIFs from Eric's DH and the last words we ever hear from Eric are "I swear I thought they were PGP files, I swear to God I thought they were....." as the authorities drag his carcass off to jail.  Whose going to believe Eric's protests of innocence?  "After all", says the prosecutor to the jury, "wasn't Eric explicitly filtering out what he didn't want in. If fact", says the prosecutor, "his filter seems to have been designed specifically to allow these kiddie-porn files in and to reject all others."  A sad end indeed!

The primary point that I'm trying to make is that there is no such thing as an algorithmic test for a dataset being in a 'state' of encryption.  Such a test is beyond alogrithmic capability (at least in our universe). Therefore, an RM/DH operator should just drop the pretense of filtering out non-encyphered submissions.  Just take what comes and tell customers that if they don't want you to read it, it's up to _them_ to make certain that you can't.  Period!  The DH operator could encypher all submissions with his own key so that the DH contents can't be compromised to outsiders.  This seems to be a much more real-world approach to the problem than tilting at windmill with encryption filters.  (The previous examples were an attempt to demonstrate, in a concrete way, the failure of any such algorithmic approach. Whatever encryption-test algorithm you come up with I guarentee you I can defeat Dale H.

This may have been mentioned, if so please ignore.  There was an interesting article in Thursday's Wall Street Journal calling for the end of anonymous communications on the Internet.
It is on page B1 under the "Personal Technology" column and was written by Walter Mossberg (mossberg at wsj.com) who invites comment.  Just a couple of quotes: "When forums operate under the cloak of anonymity, it's no differenct from printing a newpaper in which the bylines are admittedly fake, and the letters to the editor are untraceable." and "It  makes it easier to spread wild conspiracy theories, smear people, conduct financial scams or victimize others He goes on to discuss the other two BIG problems on the Internet, those being "Incivility" (flaming for breach of netiquette) and "Censorship" (cancelling of spams).

I don't mean to toss gasoline onto this fire, but......
Unix as we know has a vanishingly small probability of ever becoming 'mainstream'. There's a two-orders-of-magnitude gap between the installed base of Dos/Windows and that of Unix. That gap has grown, not marrowed over time. This is however no reflection on the obvious technical merits of Unix. Market dominance is based not on technical superiority, but rather on technical sufficiency. Once an OS acheives technical sufficiency any further technical improvements will have a diminishing marginal effect on that OS's market performance. Once the OS is technically sufficient, non-technical factors begin to dominate. The market failure of WinNT is a classic example of this. Its failure is unrelated to its technical merits (or lack thereof), but rather on econmic and social factors the even a company withe the marketing muscle of MicroSoft has not yet been able to overcome. (OS/2 is of course an example of an even more dismal, perhaps terminal, failure for many of the same reasons.)

I think you've grasped the fundementals!  You'll soon make VP of Marketing. OS/2 comes internet-ready and pre-installed and it's still an almost complete failure in the market.
In any mature market, technical superiority above some baseline level of sufficiency has no market value.  The auto market is a classic example of this. Look how long tail-fins and chrome have dominated technical superiority as the prime focus of marketing.  These are all marketing issues not technical issues!

@_subject: UNIX bashing? 
Gravity has made no attempt to embrace me, why should I embrace gravity? Because it's a force-of-nature bigger than any of us.  It's not a matter of embracing (or not embracing), it's a matter of recognizing the obvious.  Also, just as an historical note, the offical internal policy at Microsoft until about 1986-7 was that DOS was a stopgap measure that would eventually be replaced by a 16-bit version of Xenix (M/S's proprietary Unix variant) that would ship with the 286 based systems. It was the MARKET's rejection of Xenix that forced Microsoft to reluctantly look towards OS/2 and Windows rather than Unix as its future flagship OS.  Again, this has nothing to do with Unix's obvious technical merits, but the triumph of social, market and economic forces over technical forces.  Look at the fact that the existing global code-base consists overwhelmingly of Cobol closely followed by dBase with C/C++ trailing way down in the noise.  The realworld is a messy and complex place.
