Having had "*coin tipjar" explained to me, I have set up a BTC receive address.    "jim btc tipjar"      1AzNPQ1NhiD9uG1hU5g5Kdaccb88Dus2Bo
    Please note:  This address is the BTC tipjar for "Jim Bell", "James Dalton Bell", living at 7214 Corregidor, Vancouver WA 98664.  (phone and cell on request; As far as I know I'm listed.  I've never had an unlisted/unpublished phone number.).   Ham Call N7IJS (apparently I am the LAST "Tech-Plus" in existence; the FCC has refused to re-up my 2010 license application, but the laws say I can still do ham.)
    Note Also:  Having been on (and off) the Cypherpunks list since 1995 (mostly off, of course), I understand that a reasonable sense of caution will make many of you think, "Is this REALLY the 'Jim Bell' who wrote the AP essay, etc?"   For those who doubt, I have Skype set up to do a voice videophone.  There is a picture of me, in a green sweater, taken by Declan McCullagh about June 2000 on the web; I haven't changed a lot.  (I even have my green sweater, too!).
