This is my experience, too.  A huge number of the people I know around here
(RTP area, mid-North Carolina) are out of work, or are worried that they
soon will be.  This set of people includes only one cryptographer (and he's
got a job).  Also that regions and industries can vary enormously in how their economy
is going.  Areas where a lot of jobs are in the computer or travel
industries, for example, are going to have a lot of unemployment, as this
area does.  And also, it's important to note that most of us in this field
might move to a different field (e.g., more general software development,
teaching, etc.) rather than live without paychecks for a long time.  Or
might decide that now is the time to go back to school.  Unemployment stats
measure (if I'm remembering it right) only people who are not working, but
are actively looking for work.  (I don't know what definition is used to
decide if you're really looking or not.)  I feel very fortunate to still have a job, given all that's going on in
this industry.

@_subject: Katy, bar the door 
Hmmm.  I agree, but if the attackers chose the right time (while the
plane's on autopilot) to release the gas or whatever, they might have an
hour or two to get through the cockpit door, with no resistance at all from
the now-dead passengers or crew.  Securing a cockpit door in those
circumstances is *much* harder than securing it against someone with a
shorter time to get through, and with the possibility of active resistance
from the other side.  (I seem to recall hearing some pilot comment that he
was very confident of his ability to keep someone from breaking through the
door, just by flying so that it's almost impossible to stay on your feet.
Certainly, trying to use a hacksaw or cutting torch or something wouldn't
be much fun while the pilot did loops or something.)  On the other hand, the pilot or copilot pretty much just have to figure out
something is wrong and indicate this fact to the people on the ground, and
there will be a plane along shortly to shoot them down if necessary.  And I
don't think this kind of gassing attack would work all that smoothly in
practice--some people would be affected before others, due to nonuniformity
in the way air is distributed in the cabin and different levels of
susceptibility.  The combination of a hard-to-break-into cockpit and some kind of response
to prevent these planes being used as low-tech cruise missiles seems like a
win.  Maybe it would make sense to add some kind of remote surveilance of
the cockpit, though I imagine this wouldn't be too popular with pilots, and
they'd definitely need to secure the channel properly.   --John Kelsey, kelsey.j at ix.netcom.com // jkelsey at certicom.com

@_subject: Confiscation of Anti-War Video 
I think the best fix is to accept that a determined suicidal attacker will
probably manage to bring down the plane, but make sure that's the worst he
can do.  That removes the externality problem.  The current algorithm for
this is some combination of pilots being told not to go along with
hijackers' demands, and maybe some chance of getting a military jet in
place to shoot the hijacked plane down, if it is taken over by the
hijackers.  (It seems like this wouldn't be practical most of the time,
e.g., if someone takes over the plane as it's approaching landing, there
probably wouldn't be anyone in place to shoot in time.  And faster response
time means less time to discover a mistake.)  I've heard of an idea for a mechanism for putting some kind of
remote-control piloting mechanism on the plane, so that it can be taken
over from the ground.  This adds new attack points, but it might be
workable.  And of course, rockets have long had self-destruct mechanisms;
presumably, there's stuff off the shelf from NASA or the DoD that does this
with some reasonable level of security.  (This last one would be
politically unacceptable, but it's not really all that different from
having a fighter shoot the hijacked plane down.)   Both of these introduce
a bunch of new vulnerabilities, though.  Your list left out the obvious technique, which I think is more-or-less
used by El Al:  Screen your passengers really well, probably using secret
databases, various kinds of racial profiling, etc.  Routinely turn
passengers away, or make boarding the plane such an ordeal that they elect
not to fly anymore.  (One of the many problems with this is that most
flights are within the US; make flying sufficiently nasty, and people will
take trains, busses, or their own cars.  I think this is already happening
a great deal, which is one reason most airlines are doing so poorly.)  I can't imagine this being done in practice, but I wish it were.  The
problem *is* an externality, but not the one you pointed out.  Politicians
in office right now will be blamed if there's another hijacking.  So if I
choose to fly Allahu Akbar Airlines for the short security checking lines,
I get the benefit, but part of the cost lands on incumbent congressmen and
the President.  And those incumbents, unlike most people who get stuck with
such costs, have the power to do something about it.  (Something pretty
similar happens with the FDA, right?  If you get the new cancer drug a year
earlier, you get all the benefit (maybe you get to go on living); the FDA
gets the added risk of their being some horrible side effect.  So they
force a different trade-off on you than you'd prefer.)       --John Kelsey, kelsey.j at ix.netcom.com // jkelsey at certicom.com

@_subject: Metaswitch cleared by FBI for spying 
I wonder how hard it will be to just implement encryption in software on the phone.  Does anyone know if these relatively new PDA-phones have the ability to process the packets they receive from digital calls before feeding them into the codec, and the codec outputs before they send them out over the air?  Or just to set up a data-only call where you're just sending bits to/from Nautilus or some similar program?
I keep thinking that the only way we're going to get strong encryption on cellphones is to make it something that individuals can do themselves.  The cellphone providers have little incentive to do this well.
Maybe we could put the dedicated computer you're talking about at home, with two phone lines available to it.  People trying to reach you call into the box, and it is the only thing that ever legitimately calls your cellphone.  These calls can just always be encrypted, or can use Nautilus or some such thing, and set up a connection for data instead.  When the cellphone calls out, it always calls to the box first.  Ideally, the software for both the box and the phone would be open source, and no harder to set up than a VCR. In fact, this could double as a secure cordless phone, using an 802.11b card; the box chooses the cheapest method to reach your handset.
For extra credit, if two such boxes ever talk to each other, they could do end-to-end encryption.  But honestly, it's a lot more critical to get the stuff going out over the air encrypted (since that can be intercepted with very little risk of anyone noticing).
I wonder if such a box could become a kind of communications hub, handling (secure) voice mail, cellphone, and multiple cordless phones.  Someone who wants one probably wants all three, and might be willing to pay a couple hundred dollars for it, making the whole thing reasonable to sell.  Even just getting the over-the-air part encrypted means someone has to leave a paper trail or physical evidence lying around to eavesdrop on phone calls, which probably implies actually getting a warrant, rather than just getting a hacked scanner and using it to troll for interesting cellphone or cordless conversations.  And if the boxes became widespread, we'd start seeing "transparent" use of end-to-end encryption.  (The only way we're ever likely to see normal, non-paranoid non-criminals using voice encryption very often is if it's just something that happens automatically and painlessly.)

@_subject: Quarantines may be justified 
In order to distinguish when force has been initiated, you have to have some agreed-upon definitions of rights.  The whole argument you're in here about smoking has to do with boundaries of rights.  Harmon says your cigarette smoke is a form of assault.  This may or may not be valid, but it's certainly possible to come up with kinds of fumes that are a violation of the rights of the people forced to endure them (think of mustard gas, or even the smell of raw sewage), so it's not obviously bogus.
In practice, this is an area where simple rights arguments don't work all that well, because there are big areas of gray.
How about if whenever I see someone smoking in public, I go stand upwind of them and open my package of Instant Sarin Mix?   Which one of us is initiating force?  How about if I'm more polite, and merely open my package of Instant Skunk Scent Mix?  The issue is where you draw the line, and the problem is that there's no unambiguously right answer.
The only way to resolve this peaceably is to have some agreed-upon standards to resolve the gray areas into solid lines.  Those agreed-upon standards are sometimes in the form of written laws, sometimes in the form of precedent in case law, and are very often simply the unwritten standards of conduct that most people live by most of the time.  And often they need courts of some kind to rule on gray areas that exist even within those rules.

Right, but that was what was being discussed--regulation of smoking on public property.  (Which raises all kinds of interesting definitional issues, since that includes the county courthouse, the street in front of the courthouse, the river running through the middle of town, and the ocean several miles away.  Nobody bans smoking in all those places, but I think almost everyone bans smoking in government buildings, and I've seen at least one city park (here in North Carolina!) where smoking is banned once you get off the parking lot.)
[Discussing real-world antismoking laws, applied to "public places" as in places where the public happens to be--bars, restaurants, etc.]
Yep.  When only consenting adults are involved on private property, the state ought not to be involved.  For some non-obvious dangerous activities, the state might legitimately require a warning of some kind (e.g., "DANGER--POISON"),  though in practice this usually seems to devolve to attaching a warning label to everything, with the effect that you don't always know an ass-covering warning label from an honest-to-God, drink a teaspoon of this and you're a corpse, sort of warning label.  And for some dangerous activities the state might legitimately restrict children from the activity, though second-hand smoke is a couple orders of magnitude too low of a risk for this to make sense.  (And the other Schelling point is to let parents make decisions for their kids until the kids are being obviously abused or subjected to horrifying risks.)
My point was that it's not obvious where the line gets drawn for (say) offensive smells or dangerous fumes, but it is obvious that there needs to be a line there somewhere.  Sarin, tear gas, or skunk smell are pretty obvious examples of fumes that, if I give them off in a public place or waft them over to your property, ought to be actionable somehow.  Fumes from various inhaled/smoked drugs are somewhere in a gray area.
These gray areas exist in every area of life, and a lot of libertarians seem to miss them, because they don't fit cleanly into the list-of-rights-granted-by-God/Rand/TheConstitution model.  (For some discussion by a libertarian who understands them very well, see David Friedman's wonderful book _Law's Order_.)

@_subject: double-spending prevention w. spent coins 
Right.  You actually can get reasonable anonymity with the kind of scheme you're proposing, assuming anonymous communications and heavy use of the system.  When you get a coin issued, you just keep it in limbo for awhile, and then "spend" it with yourself, iterating until your paranoia level is satisfied.  If the system is heavily used for real stuff, and the uses are over an anonymous communications network, there should be no way for the bank to tell when you're transferring the coin to yourself, vs. when you're transferring it to someone else.  The bank can tell that you have coin X today, and that 20 iterations ago, that was coin Y.  But that isn't going to give very much information about whether the coin is still in the possession of the same person.  The user effectively pays for his level of anonymity with float, because he has to maintain a random, plausible spending pattern for enough transfers to leave the bank with very little information about whether his coins are his.  Less paranoid users can use coins immediately, or after one or two iterations, for less security but faster access to their money.  (It seems like I've seen this kind of idea discussed on cypherpunks before....)
If you play with this protocol a bit, you can do a surprising amount with it--use multiple banks to allow unlinkability with your coins that is similar in strength to the anonymity you get with remailer networks, for example.  (You still end up having to trust your bank not to steal the money, but that's pretty common.)
In general, if I know enough to spend a coin once, I know enough to spend it several times.  Every solution to this I've ever heard of comes down to one of:
a.  Embedding an identity in the coins in a way that comes out when they're double-spent, and handling double-spending offline by getting someone arrested.
b.  Using some locally trusted device on the spender's machine to prevent double-spending pre-emptively, e.g., because the code on your tamper-resistant token won't permit it.
c.  Checking the status of the coin online when the transaction is made. (Sometimes this is done only for some random subset of the coins, for The techniques for doing (a) are brilliant, but they still leave you with "and then someone goes to jail" as one of your protocol steps, which makes the protocols that use them a lot less interesting.  And once you're doing online clearing, there's little point to messing around with the complicated stuff you have to do to get the spender's identity embedded in pairs of double-spent coins.

Just a nitpick: Information goods are generally free when they've already been produced, because the second copy costs approximately $0.00 to make.  But getting the initial information produced can cost quite a bit.  I have worked for many years as a consultant, doing work remotely, and I certainly don't give the information away.  Similarly, when I go to the doctor, or have my taxes done, all I'm really paying for is information, but my doctor and accountant expect to be paid. (Alas, the cost of *duplicating* my medical or financial records is very low, which is why there are big privacy issues there, but they weren't so cheap to produce in the first place....)
Whether any of that will really ever be worth doing anonymously is an open question. Most of the time, I'd be pretty scared to do business with a doctor that dared not show his face or have his name known to the world, for example.

So, I think that's pretty sound advice, but I don't think any of the top ten reasons for supporting it involve whether Al Qaida will stop attacking us.  Maybe they will, maybe they won't, but our foreign policy ought to be made based on what is in our long-term best interest ("our" meaning American citizens); realistically, terrorist attacks are a fairly small part of that calculation.  For example, we could presumably beat China in a war, but such a war would be enormously more expensive and dangerous than fighting Al Qaida.  If continuing to play world's policeman improves our chances of avoiding war with China, at the cost of bringing about some attacks from Al Qaida, that's a win for us.
Now, I suspect that playing world's policeman does *not* make us less likely to get into really dangerous and expensive war, and often gets us caught up in little wars that could expand into bigger ones.  (The Korean war apparently came relatively close to getting us into a war with China, for example.)  But there's at least some argument to be made about that--for example, by ensuring the security of Japan and Germany, we have avoided having two potentially very well-armed and dangerous opponents wandering around, possibly going on an empire-building spree that would have forced us into a nuclear war with them sooner or later.
Isn't he alleged to have also done the Olympic Park bombing?  (Who knows whether he really did, or whether the FBI just assumed he had so they'd only have one domestic terrorist at large.)
Anyway, my point is that it's never going to be acceptable for the US government to pull out of making decisions about policy within the US.  A campaign of terrorism against abortion clinics, or against liquor stores, or against bookstores, can't be responded to by changes in policy to appease the terrorists without giving up on any kind of a free society.

Well, clearly bombing and invading them was an initiation of force, in the most literal sense--we shot first.  But while I can see that individuals have a right that you violate by initiating force against them, I don't see how that can apply to governments, especially governments whose main method of keeping power involves terrorizing their citizens.  Did the Iraqi government have a right to stay in power, or at least not to be invaded?  Where did that right come from?  From the rights of its people, most of whom apparently didn't have a hell of a lot good to say about it?  (That doesn't mean they like *us*, of course.)
In the most morally neutral case, this is like one criminal gang attacking another.  If the Sopprano family invades the Bozini family's turf, takes over their protection rackets, and hunts down their godfather, it could be messy, and it really will be an initiation of force in the most literal sense.  But is this the same kind of "initiation of force" that we normally talk about when, say, a mugger knocks me over the head and takes my laptop and wallet? (And of course, it's not that morally neutral.  It's more like a bunch of vigilantes from the neighborhood next door getting rid of the gang running your neighborhood, for reasons of their own, but probably to your benefit.)
None of this means it made any sense for us to invade Iraq, or that we did it mainly to liberate oppressed Iraqi citizens.  But I think using the same kind of language for interactions between individuals and between governments is a mistake.

The cost in machine resources to transmit one more e-mail is *really* small.  The cost I care about is my time, specifically my time spent leafing through my likely-spam folder checking to see if someone I actually want to hear from sent me something worth seeing.  (This is a hassle, because sometimes people e-mail me with questions or comments about papers I've written, and I'd like to see those e-mails.  And those e-mails can come from all over the world, can have oddly-worded subject lines, etc.)
If spammers had to pay for the true cost of transferring all their e-mails, spam might slow down a bit, but it wouldn't stop; bandwidth is too cheap.  If they had to pay for the true cost of all the time they wasted, spam would be seriously rare.  (So would telemarketing calls, and probably even junk mail; those are businesses built on shifting many of the real costs of their marketing effort onto their targets.)
The only way to make spammers pay for the cost of my time is to set up some scheme where your initial e-mail to me costs some amount I set, and then I can let you in after that.  But that's a lot harder to set up than hashcash or the memory-bound schemes.  And certainly, doing something that takes one second on a reasonably fast machine won't make sending e-mail unusable even for fairly slow machines, while it will make spamming require getting access to lots of other peoples' machines, either by paying them or by taking them over remotely.

I can't imagine this is the stupidest, but there's a state office building in Missouri where (no doubt due to some Directive From On High), they've put up a wooden shack in front of the main entrance, where anyone going in or out has to pass through a metal detector.

It's more like about 50' in front of it, completely unconnected to the building.
The really entertaining bit is that, since most people going into the building are basically law abiding (state employees), most people seem to go through the shack and get checked for weapons, rather than around the shack to save time.

Well, there's a difference between a system to recover plaintext given ciphertext (which ought not to work for any decent cipher, given a hill-climbing sort of approach), and a system to help a human work out the right way to cryptanalyze a system.  Hill-climbing techniques make sense when analyzing a component of a cipher, say.  (I know people have done stuff like this in various places, but I'm away from my library, so you'll have to look it up yourself.)
This ought to just be the other side of using these systems to do analysis.  If you can find an especially good way to partition the set of texts for a partitioning attack, you can use that to decide how to design your cipher to resist the attacks, for example.

That's generally true of biometrics.  Unless taking the measurement is so intrusive it's obvious when it's taken (e.g., maybe the geometry of your sinus cavities or some such thing that requires a CAT scan to measure properly), there's no secret.  People constantly seem to get themselves in trouble trying to use biometrics in a system as though they were secret.
The best you can usually do is to make it moderately expensive and difficult to actually copy the biometric in a way that will fool the reader.  But this is really hard.  In fact, making special-purpose devices that are hard to copy or imitate is pretty difficult.  It seems enormously harder to find a hard-to-copy, easy-to-use "token" that just happens to come free with a normal human body.
I think the best way to think about any biometric is as a very cheap, moderately hard to copy identification token.  Think of it like a good ID card that just happens to be very hard to misplace or lend to your friends.

This whole idea was talked to death many years ago on sci.crypt, and probably before that other places.  The good news is that it's not too hard to come up with a design that lets you encrypt a large hard drive in such a way that there's no way to determine how many "tracks" of secret data are there.  I believe one of Ross Anderson's students did a design for this; it doesn't seem like a really hard problem to solve if you don't mind losing most of your effective disk capacity.  The bad news is that you *really* need to think about your threat model before using it, since there's necessarily no way for you to prove that there no more tracks of secret data.  It takes no imagination at all to think of ways you might end up wishing you *could* convince someone you'd given them the key to all the IMO, the only way to do this kind of thing is to have the data, or at least part of the key, stored remotely.  The remote machine or machines can implement duress codes, limits to the number ot password guesses allowed per day, number of invalid password guesses before the thing just zeros out the key and tells the person making the attempt it has done so, etc.  Trust me, you *want* the server to loudly announce that it will zero the key irretrievably after the tenth bad password....

I think phones that encrypt the landline part of the call are pretty low-priority for most of us, since it costs something to eavesdrop on these calls.  But anything that goes over the air, whether cellphone or cordless phone, ought to be properly encrypted, and it isn't now.  This is a big vulnerability in a lot of places, and once you've built the intercept and decrypting hardware, it's easy to eavesdrop on huge numbers of people.  You can imagine either rogue cops and spies doing this, or private criminals.
I keep wondering how hard it would be to build a cordless phone system on top of 802.11b with some kind of decent encryption being used.  I'd really like to be able to move from a digital spread spectrum cordless phone (which probably has a 16-bit key for the spreading sequence or some such depressing thing) to a phone that can't be eavesdropped on without tapping the wire.
And for cellphones, I keep thinking we need a way to sell a secure cellphone service that doesn't involve trying to make huge changes to the infrastructure, which probably means a call center that handles all contact with the cellphone itself, always encrypted.  Something like this would allow me to buy a phone and sign a contract, and quickly get real security on all my digital calls going over the air.  End-to-end encryption isn't nearly as important.  There's no reason it couldn't be supported, of course, when both endpoints had the right kind of phone, but it's a small additional value.  The big win is to stop spewing private conversations over the radio in the clear.

I agree end-to-end encryption is worthwhile if it's available, but even when someone's calling my cellphone from a normal landline phone, I'd like it if at least the over-the-air part of the call was encrypted.  That's a much bigger vulnerability than someone tapping the call at the base station or at the phone company.  Otherwise, encrypted phone calls with the secure cellphone start looking a lot like encrypted e-mail with PGP--I have PGP, so do a few other people, but most people I want to talk to don't have it installed, and so most of my calls remain in the clear.  This includes phone calls to my doctor, mother, priest, shrink, sister, lawyer, best friend, wife, bank, accountant, etc., e.g., all the calls I probably really wanted secured, and which will basically never be secured end-to-end if this requires each of those people to buy a special new phone, or do some tinkering with configuring secure phone software for their PDA.  "Hmmm, which key size do I need?  Is 1024 bits long enough?  Why do I have to move the mouse around, again, anyway?"  For essentially all of these, just getting to where I can use a cordless or cell phone on these calls without feeling like I'm broadcasting my private conversations in the clear would be great.  Securing the other end is even better, but I'd like to do the part I can do now, not when the world finally realizes that unencrypted wireless stuff is a gaping privacy hole.
Yep.  I have this mental picture of downloading some software for my PDA/cellphone, and buying a $200 box for my home, and getting a secure cordless phone when I'm in range, and a secure cellphone when I'm not, maybe with a secure voicemail system thrown in for good measure.  It seems like most of this is off-the-shelf technology (wireless networking, a box connected to two landlines, some minimal encryption and key management software, etc.).
When you ask for a secure call, your cellphone calls the box in your house (over an encrypted link), and it makes the rest of the call.  Similarly, when someone calls your secure phone line number, it rings at the box, and then gets forwarded over the encrypted link to your cellphone.  If two boxes like this call each other, they do end-to-end encryption.  But the over-the-air stuff always gets encrypted.  It sure seems like this would be worth putting up with a little delay in the call setup.  (But maybe there's some reason this won't work.)

Big brother has a limited budget, just like the rest of us.  If he has to produce a warrant or tap a wire somewhere to listen in on me, he probably won't bother.
The only thing protecting my cellphone calls right now is trivially-broken encryption, the need for some moderately expensive equipment, and some laws prohibiting cellphone eavesdropping.  That means that some bad guys may be eavesdropping now, and there's no telling how many bad guys will be doing so tomorrow.  Nobody here knows how much eavesdropping is being done, because communications intercepts can be done without leaving any record anywhere.  Do the police in some cities troll for interesting cellphone calls?  Does the NSA do that in the US, quietly?  Do Russian or French intelligence agencies?  How would we know?
So, what can I do about it, as an individual?  Make the cellphone companies build good crypto into their systems?  Any ideas how to do that?
The only way I can see getting decent security on my cellphone is to do something that doesn't require the rest of the world's permission or assistance.  The simplest version of that is to have a box at my house that's connected to two phone lines, and have all calls to and from my cellphone go through that box.  Calls to other secure cellphones can be encrypted end-to-end.  Calls to everyone else get encrypted between my phone and my box at home.  I spend a little extra for extra security, nobody else has to pay anything, and I can call friends on my cellphone without being susceptible to trivial eavesdropping.
Can the bad guys defeat this?  Sure, they can tap my landline, or bug my car, or do all sorts of other things.  But none of those are cheap enough to do to everyone, and probably none are cheap enough to do to me.  Tapping my landline either means interacting with the phone company, or paying someone to go install a tap, each of which implies a risk of getting caught, practical limits on how often it can be done, etc.
This also bypasses the "network effect" of encrypting phones, where you get approximately zero benefit from having one until they're widespread.  I have an old Comsec 3DES phone at home.  It's nice technology.  I think I've used it twice.  If you're not a cryptographer or a cocaine smuggler, you probably don't know anyone who owns an encrypting phone or would particularly want to.  Even if you'd like to improve your own privacy, you can't buy an end-to-end encrypting phone and improve it much.  That's what I'd like to see change.

So, have you ever tried doing substantial revisions on a large document that's going back and forth between two or more versions of Word?  It's in MS' interest to get everyone using the same version, so it's not really in their interest to spend great amounts of time debugging their version translation functions.  It shows.
If you need to coordinate working on a big Word document with several other people (e.g., clients or coworkers who are most comfortable with Word), you pretty-much will need to use not just Word, but the same version of Word.  That doesn't need any secure hardware to enforce, just buggy software.  You can sometimes work around this, but it's a pain to do.
Well, let's distinguish between:
a.  The sort of network monopoly situation Microsoft is in, where the world has more-or-less settled on a bunch of their products, and so they can do a lot of irritating things before they actually lose their dominant market position.  (Note that this doesn't mean they are unassailable; Word Perfect and Lotus -123 were once in similarly dominant positions.)
b.  Eventual laws requiring that every new computer contain a secure processing unit to enforce the dictates of the government, the record companies, or whomever else on your computers.
I think a lot of the objection to TCPA is the worry that it will be mandated eventually, and that it will then be used to cement the network monopoly held by MS forever.  And Vinge's description of "ubiquitous governance" comes to mind here--whether it's MS or the US federal government or the UN or the Catholic Church, if someone can put themselves in control of all computer equipment you own in some secure way, they look a heck of a lot like the government.
Sure.  Or you can often translate their documents, or open them with OpenOffice.  I do this when I just need to read and comment on a Word document.  But if you are going to be revising and sending back the document a few times, this will not work--you will lose some formatting, you will probably introduce weird formatting bugs, you may mess up the file format, etc.  It's just not worth the pain.  Though I have a legitimate copy of Word on my machine, when given a choice, I always do everything in ASCII text until the very end, and then paste the text into Word and do formatting last.  But again, this isn't too helpful if it's a document I'm working on with someone else.
Mainframe customers used to put up with this kind of treatment routinely, so it's not impossible.  Whether it will fly these days is an interesting question, but I don't think the answer is obvious.  Someone might ask the same rhetorical question about whether customers would sit still for buggy, insecure software.  But nobody would ask that question these days, as the answer is so painfully obvious.

Well, that part is still to be determined.

Or another zillion possibilities, including the apparently more likely ones that include continuing existence and power of states, but with a change in the balance of powers in different areas--no privacy in public, but enormous privacy in what you do on your computer at home, etc.  Or an expansion of the current situation, where the new technology results in less privacy from the government, but enormously more privacy from neighbors and family members.  (Think of cellphones, cordless phones, the internet, and home video rentals.  For most people, keeping their nosy neighbors from knowing they watch porno films is more important than keeping the FBI from knowing.)
A huge amount of the value of this list, for me at least, is that events and news are seen through the lens of a certain kind of skepticism that only security people seem to have, along with some technological sophistication and a willingness to "think the unthinkable."  This is consistent with a wide range of political and social and religious beliefs.

Nitpick: You could argue that much of the research in physics wouldn't be happening without substantial government funding for research.  Certainly, it's hard to see who would be funding a lot of this stuff with any eye to practical applications within their lifetimes.
This is obviously true.  In fact, hearing people say that capitalism stifles innovation, and offering the modern US as an example, is a bit mind-numbing.  The pace of innovation in almost every field is breathtaking.  Imagine taking a modern, Wal-Mart-available solar powered scientific calculator, and dropping it on Leslie Groves' desk in 1943.  That whole group of brilliant scientists and engineers working on the first atomic bomb would have had a hell of a time distinguishing the result from space-alien technology, other than the convenient use of our numbering and lettering system.  (And they would have been scared s***less when they saw "made in Japan" on the back!)
Nor is this just true of this century.  Look at the rate of innovation in the US and UK in the 1800s, under more-or-less capitalistic rules.  Railroads and telegraphs and steam ships and radio and electricity and chemical fertilizers and pesticides and the germ theory of disease and the very beginning glimmers of modern physics and machine guns and barbed wire and streetcars and mass production factories and modern steel bridges These two centuries have defined the modern world, and whatever the reasons, nearly all the real innovations have happened in mostly capitalistic countries with substantial personal freedom, and (probably more importantly) the ability to let new technology displace incumbents and to allow innovators to be rewarded for their innovation by the opportunity to do still more innovation.

But when the forces are within spitting distance of having the same technology, social organization becomes very important.  If one side is organized as several hundred independent, overlapping protection agencies, some with mutual defense treaties, others without them, while the other is organized as a centralized army, it looks to me like the centralized forces have huge This is the interesting question: Would the anarchocapitalist society have and keep an advantage?  I don't think you can answer it except by experiment, but it's at least as feasible to me that the right kind of authoritarian state might be pretty damned good at keeping up with an anarchocapitalist one for technology, and would be better at some technology.  (Think of what you can learn about engineered diseases when you have a big population of "volunteers" from your political prisons to experiment on, a la Draka.)  And the biggest problem is that an open society won't keep things secret all that well.  That's good for progress--you can't predict who is going to make the next breakthrough--but it's not so good for security.  But it's hard to see why a technically adept authoritarian society couldn't keep up by simply reading the open literature and planting a few spies.  Especially if it could also occasionally manage a takeover, or an ideological conversion.
As an example of this, think of NSA and related agencies, vis-a-vis the public crypto community.  I'm sure they never had any idea of some of the stuff that's been done in academic cryptography before it was published.  But they still have an advantage, because they don't publish and we do.
Nor is "technologically adept authoritarian society" an obvious contradiction, no matter how nice it would be if it were.  Germany wasn't exactly a hotbed of classical liberal thought before the two world wars, and certainly wasn't a free society once the Nazis took over, and yet it was unambiguously able to do high tech well.  The USSR was basically a third-world country, complete with starving peasants, and yet was able to keep up with the West in military technology for many years.

[Talking about government-assisted projects and businesses going broke]
It's very clear that this is bad policy, though I'm not too sure it's actually unconstitutional.  Didn't the states finance and run some of the early canals?  The big problem is that the state has to have all kinds of coercive powers to do its main jobs, and those powers are awfully handy when the state is trying to protect its state-run businesses from competition, or buy land for its favored new project that the owner doesn't really want to sell, or whatever.  A secondary problem is that there's no limit to how much the business can lose, when it simply can't go broke because the state owns and protects it.  Just look at AMTRAK.  (And as many of us have learned to our cost in the last few years, there's almost no limit other than bankruptcy to how quickly a badly-run business can lose Yep.  Though I think it's a lot more common that a private company builds and operates the shopping malls, but with special incentives given to the company by the government.  This is basically patronage, and it's always been a big part of local politics.  How does that Huey Long quote go?  Something like "Those who give a lot will get a large slice of the pie; those who give a little will get a small slice of the pie, and those who give nothing will get...good government."  And of course, you get interesting competition between local governments, with each offering a bigger bag of goodies paid for by the taxpayers, or seized by condemning someone's property, so that the big mall built two years ago goes bankrupt because of the newer, shinier, even more subsidized mall that's just been built a few miles away.  The same sort of competition happens for factories.  I'm not usually a "there oughta be a law" kind of person, but in this case, a well-thought-out federal law prohibiting this kind of competition would be a major net benefit to taxpayers and local governments throughout the country.

The realistic benefit is that you can use something like hashcash as one of your spam filtering rules.  Anyone who is spending 1/2 sec on a reasonable machine per e-mail sent isn't likely to be spamming you, because that won't scale up very well for sending out thousands of e-mails at a time.  The problem is that until it is widely adopted, it's not a very useful additional filter.
There are actually dozens of similar ways to stop nearly all spam, if you can deploy them all over the net at once.  But deploying anything all over the net at once isn't practical, so instead, each user or ISP tries to find some workable solution for the problem, typically involving changing his filtering rules  every few months and spending a minute or two a day going through his spam folder, making sure he's not throwing away something --John Kelsey, kelsey.j at ix.netcom.com

If you're willing to make some plausible assumptions about SHA1, you can do this with a lot of confidence.  SHA1(secret_key || hash(message)) is deterministic, but an attacker who doesn't know secret_key cannot distinguish it from random, and so can't predict it.  Conditioned on the attacker's knowledge and computing resources, the random number generated in this way is uniformly distributed.
This depends on an (IMO) unprovable assumption about SHA1: that the expected work needed to predict its output is approximately bounded by the lower of 2^{160} or the expected work needed to guess its input.
FIPS186 (the document that specifies DSA) proposes a cryptographic pseudorandom number generator for use with DSA.  That PRNG depends on more-or-less the same property, though it only uses SHA1's compression There was a Eurocrypt article describing this kind of idea a couple of years back, though I think they did something a little more mathematically clean than relying on SHA1 directly.  (I'm away from my books, so you'll have to look it up yourself if you're interested.)
RSA doesn't need randomness in generating signatures, though if you're generating the keypair on the same device, you really need to have some confidence in your random numbers, or you'll shoot yourself in the foot.  And if you want to blind RSA to prevent timing and some power analysis attacks, you'll need to have a source of random or cryptographic pseudorandom numbers.

I believe one of Ross Anderson's students did something like this a few years ago, basically using error-correcting codes with a lot of redundancy.  The basic idea is that you use some kind of massive error correction and use a different sequence of bits with each key, so that you're very unlikely to have enough of your message bits clobbered by another message to make it impossible to decode correctly.  (It seems like there'd be a problem with information leakage about number of channels here, if you had a message encoded in that block of bits, because you would know when you decoded it how often you'd had bits flipped, but maybe they resolved that somehow.)

@_subject: voting 
I think the VoteHere scheme and David Chaum's scheme both claim to solve this problem.  The voting machine gives you a receipt that convinces you (based on other information you get) that your vote was counted as cast, but which doesn't leak any information at all about who you voted for to anyone else.  Anyone can take that receipt, and prove to themselves that your vote was counted (if it was) or was not counted (if it wasn't).  (This is based on attending a presentation of David's scheme at George Washington a few months ago, a conversation I had with a VoteHere guy, and some conversations and documents given to me by each.  I haven't tried to verify the protocols or proofs, but I'm convinced that all this is possible, modulo various assumptions.  There may be a dozen other people doing similar things, that I've simply not heard of.)
The way I understood these schemes, you can see the initial encrypted ballots (they're published), and then there are several rounds of publically verifiable shuffling and decryption by different TTPs.  After the last round of shuffling and decryption, you have raw votes.  So anyone can verify the count, assuming the set of initial encrypted ballots are legitimate.  And anyone can produce a receipt that can be shown to be one of those encrypted ballots, if it was counted.  That doesn't keep someone from stuffing the ballot box, but it does mean that anyone who throws away unfavorable votes is going to leave behind evidence, which can potentially call the whole vote into question.  The way I saw these schemes described, there was no recount capability, but the count was done in a completely public way.
It seems to me that this kind of scheme has a lot of potential for disruption attacks, since one compromised voting machine can be used to call any election into question.  But I could be missing something, as this is really not something I've spent a lot of time on....
I see your point, but there's an awful lot of any voting system that isn't being closely observed by the voters, or that isn't really well-understood by most of them.  It's not so clear to me that the average voter is going to walk away convinced that a voter-verified paper ballot, or a mark-sense ballot, or whatever other thing isn't going to somehow be subject to attack.  Or that if they do walk away convinced, that this has much to do with whether they *should* walk away convinced.
Yep, this is a big issue.  Which is why I think everyone with any sense agrees that we need some kind of independent audit trail, regardless of whether we're doing voting with computers, or with pens for punching out holes.  There are a bunch of ways to do this, one obvious and pretty easy-to-field choice being voter-verified paper ballots.
Huh?  Do you think the same is true of payment systems?  Those also ultimately require some humans to play by the rules, but it sure seems like a well-designed payment system can remove a lot of the ambiguity about who has violated the rules, and can outright prevent other kinds of rule violations.  And it seems to me that this is very similar to the situation with voting.
Touch screen voting (with the audio extensions) has at least one huge advantage over pen-and-paper schemes, because blind people can vote with them.  The VoteHere and Chaum schemes provide other benefits (a lot of kinds of misbehavior by the authorities are prevented by the design, though of course, not *all* possible misbehavior), at various costs in system complexity, dependence on lots of interacting systems that might not be all that reliable, ability to recover from some low level of fraud, etc.  Paper ballots printed behind glass provide a different set of tradeoffs.  And you could design twenty other sets of tradeoffs.  I'm not at all convinced that the way we optimize for best security is to minimize technology.
I agree that it's easy to get carried away by the elegance of your mathematics, or by the really spiffy blinking lights on the computer, and forget the essentials.  But technology and math aren't somehow inherently bad things to introduce to voting systems.  It just has to be done in a way that makes sense, right?
Less subject to vote tampering than the old machines with mechanical counters and levers?  That's not too hard.  Less subject to vote tampering than paper ballots marked by hand, that may be a little more of a challenge.  I think it's more fair to say that the attacks and threats will be different, and that the risk of a class break (work out the details of the attack once, then change votes all over the country) is seriously scary.  But it's sure not clear to me that adding computers to the mix must decrease security, or even must leave it unchanged.

  The "profitably" part is a non-issue when you have black budgets,

This is silly.  They have black budgets, but not infinite ones.  Given their budget (whatever it is), they want to buy the most processing bang for their buck.  I doubt they can do that substantially better than anyone else.  I'd expect them to be really clever at finding tricks to optimize keysearch of various kinds, but not to have better microprocessor technology than the rest of the world.    Bottom line: they're not ahead in tech, but they can make things that
  private-co engineeers only dream of.  DesCrack is a suitcase, get it?
So, then they can break 3-key 3DES with moderate numbers of texts as soon as they can build 2^{56} such suitcases, right?  And power them, and get rid of their waste heat....
  I'll let you speculate on AESCrack :-)
Do the math, and you'll see how implausible 128-bit keysearch is.  Maybe there are better attacks on AES (the algebraic stuff doesn't seem to have gone anywhere, but it still might), but if keysearch is all we have to worry about, and nontrivial quantum computers remain impractical to build, then 128-bit keys are as secure as we're ever likely to need, and 256-bit keys more or less eliminate keysearch of any kind from the list of things we need ever worry about again.

It can be made harder in a lot of ways (e.g., upping the iteration count, or doing Abadi's trick of generating a big salt value but not disclosing all of it), but all this ends up with the attacker's extra work linear in the user's extra work.  Of course, if the user chooses good passwords, it's a pretty big linear factor, but it's still linear--I double my iteration count, and the attacker doubles his work, though he's always doing a million times as much work as I am.  The only really good solution is to use some external device to mediate in password->key generation.  But then you've got to make sure that device is always available, or you're unable to get at your data.

Maybe, but I think it would be very hard to write a general-purpose stego detector, without knowing the techniques used for encoding the message.  And if you know the distribution of your cover channel as well as your attacker, or can generate lots of values from that distribution even if you can'd describe it, you can encode messages in a way that provably can't be detected, down to the quality of your random number generator and the difficulty of guessing your key.  I imagine this as something much like a virus scanner.  Look for known stego programs, and also for signatures of known stegp programs.  Really good programs might be impossible to find without doing, say, a password search.  But it's worth noting that AQ has to do key management just like the rest of us, and that's hard when you are communicating with a lot of different people.  If your stego is password-protected, some terrorist's laptop is going to have a post-it note on the screen with the password.  --John Kelsey

If you are a smart person who does something like this 20 times a day, you'll soon get a really good feel for when something odd is going on.  Also, any kind of in-depth questioning is likely to uncover a lot of fraudulent claims.

Maybe so.  It's clearly added cost to the attackers--they have to select not just the subset of volunteers willing to blow themselves up on the plane, but the subset of *those* who can also keep cool under rapid-fire questioning of their cover story.  The attackers probably have to either spend a lot of time rehearsing their cover stories, or have to keep their cover stories very close to their actual lives and interests, which makes profiling easier.  Both of these cut way down on the total pool of attackers available.  My assumption is that national intelligence agencies can probably afford to do this--they can probably filter through a lot more possible candidates to get field agents who can handle a cover story well, for example, since they can hire openly, rather than quietly recruiting from madrassa students or something.  Their training facilities can be centralized and stay in one place, rather than being a camp in the desert somewhere that has to be abandoned frequently, and they can develop a lot of expertise in training people to survive intensive questioning without fumbling their cover story.

Well, western democracies seem to be surviving okay while maintaining big social welfare states.

Presumably this works out only to the extent that most people can't or won't go on welfare.  And the thing that currently looks like it *might* suck currently successful societies down is taxpayer-financed pension schemes for everyone who gets old.  In that case, the size of the pool of recipients is growing very quickly, for demographic reasons that don't seem possible to change.  Also, while really poor people often don't don't vote and aren't elloquent or effective at demanding increases to their benefits, people close to retirement age (50s) are at the peak of their political power, vote in large numbers, and are quite good at demanding expanded benefits without sounding like welfare queens demanding more money for crack and beer.

a.  AQ has worked out that it's cheaper and safer to disrupt life in the US by "chatter" than by actually trying any attacks here, and disrupting holidays is more fun.
b.  There really have been attacks planned, but they've either been foiled actively (e.g., the terrorists got arrested or shot or something before the attack took place) or passively (e.g., the higher alert status, changes to security procedures, etc., have made the terrorists postpone their attacks.
c.  There really isn't much useful information about AQ plans in the available intelligence, and what we're seeing is the intelligence community's priors (in the Bayesian sense; their prior assumptions are swamping the effects of their meager data).

I'm no big fan of science by press release, but when's the last time you heard of anyone saying "Well, we looked at our security situation, and two teenagers with bottle rockets could set this thing off.  That's why the CEO has decided to move out of town."  The usual response after you've pointed out a devastating attack on someone's system is "yeah, but who'd think of that" or "but you're being unrealistic--real attackers will do this other thing (that we just happen to have defended against) instead."

I gather we waited to start the offensive in Fallujah(sp?) until the polls were all closed.   I'm not sure how much of this was trying to time things not to interfere with the election (the buildup has been going on for awhile, and Kerry could have squawked about this but didn't, so presumably he didn't think it was unfair for the attack to be delayed a bit), and how much was trying to bury the coverage of a pretty bloody battle with a lot of civilians dying and a lot of peoples homes destroyed, behind the whole election coverage.

Yep, I always get a kick out of this line.  Alice says "if you don't vote, you have no right to complain about the outcome."  Bob says "if you don't volunteer for a campaign, man the phone banks, go door to door, and give till it hurts, you have no right to complain about the outcome."  Carol says "If you don't stockpile weapons, organize into cells, and run a campaign of terror bombing and assassination, you have no right to complain about the outcome."  Why is one of these people more obviously right than the others?  [I know you weren't agreeing with the quoted statement either.]
In practice, Alice's strategy has almost no impact on the result--nothing I did as a Maryland voter could have given Bush fewer electoral votes than he already got, and that's true almost everywhere for an individual voter.  This is especially true if you're an individual voter whose major issues are just not very important to most other voters.  Kerry spent essentially no time talking about the creepy implications of the Jose Padilla case (isn't he still being held incommunicado, pending filing in the right district?), or the US government's use of torture in the war on terror despite treaties and the basic obligations of civilized people not to do that crap.  I see little indication that Kerry would have disclaimed the power to do those things, had the vote swung a couple percentage points the other way.
Bob's strategy has more going for it, but it comes down to a tradeoff between alternate uses of your time.  You could devote your time to the Bush or Kerry or Badnarik campaigns, or you could improve your ability to survive whatever ugliness may come in other ways--maybe by making more money and banking it against future problems, or improving your standing in your field, so you're likely to be employable even in a massive post-terror-attack recession.  Maybe just spending quality time with your wife and kids, on the theory that the bad guys may manage to vaporize you tomorrow whichever clown gets elected Bozo-in-Chief.  Carol's strategy seems doomed to fail to me--look how much damage has been done to the pro-life movement by the very small number of wackos willing to shoot abortion doctors and bomb clinics.  I'm always amazed at the revolutionary talk from people on this list, as though libertarian/anarchocapitalist ideas weren't an almost invisibly small minority in the US, as though some kind of unrest leading to a civil war would lead anywhere any of us would like.

News story quoted by RAH:
The interesting thing here is that they can't really test how effective the system is until they have another terrorist event on an airline.  Otherwise, they can assess the false positive rate of their list (people who were on the no-fly-list, shouldn't have flown according to the rules, but did without trying to hijack the plane), and the false positive and false negative rate of their search for names in the list (e.g., when it becomes obvious that Benjamin Ladon from Peoria, IL would have matched, but wasn't the guy they were hoping to nab, or when it becomes obvious that a suspected terrorist was in the data, did fly, but wasn't caught by the software).  Presumably a lot of the goal here is to stop hassling everyone with a last name that starts with al or bin, stop hassling Teddy Kennedy getting on a plane, etc., while still catching most of the people on their watchlists who fly under their real name.  This is a goofy number.  If there were 100,000 likely terrorists walking the streets, we'd have buildings and planes and bus stops and restaurants blowing up every day of the week.  I'll bet you're risking your career if you ever take someone off the watchlist who isn't a congressman or a member of the Saudi royal family, but that it costs you nothing to add someone to the list.  In fact, I'll bet there are people whose performance evaluations note how many people they added to the watchlist.  This is what often seems to make watchlists useless--eventually, your list of threats has expanded to include Elvis Presley and John Lennon, and at that point, you're spending almost all your time keeping an eye on (or harassing) random harmless bozos.

I know this is currently known to be false by all informed opinion, but I don't think it's crazy to worry about it.  If we want to fight high-tech wars like the invasion of Iraq, lots of conscript troops aren't that useful.  If we want to occupy places like Iraq, we need people to do the occupying, and it's clear that there's some strain on our forces now.  Conscript troops might very well be useful for that kind of work.  Suppose we invade and occupy Iran next.  Where will the soldiers needed to hold down occupied territory come from?  Suppose we follow up with Syria, which is surely about as repressive and nasty a place as Saddam's Iraq.  Three things are very clear about the current situation:
a.  A lot of people are finding out that their military obligations are going to be longer and much less pleasant than they expected.  This is going to have a big impact on recruiting in the future.
b.  If we just want to hold down what we've got, we have enough troops to do it, but if we want to really go on a democratizing bender in the Middle East, we'll need more troops.  c.  It's not at all clear we won't be taking some action against Iran in the next year.  Hopefully, that won't involve invading them, but it could.

It seems like there would have to have been someone to take over in a fairly clean way, or we'd have wound up setting off a civil war.   Note that in the Kurdish parts of Iraq, there was someone to take over, and those parts are generally not a problem for us.  (Once it's not our people getting shot at, we probably don't care that much if it's a pain for someone else to police.)   But I think the parts of Iraq that Saddam was still ruling had few high-profile leaders with forces that could have taken over quickly--he wasn't especially fond of potential rivals.  Maybe we could have cut a deal with some local strongmen and gotten something stable together with minimal US involvement  if we'd done it early, I'm not sure.

Maybe.  I guess the thing that's confusing about any of these answers is that the rules as they're applied must be propogated to thousands of people.  It's not like they could easily hide guidance like "no more than 10 Arabs per flight" or "double-screen anyone with brown skin and a Koran"--someone would leak it.  Perhaps the written rules include things like this that they don't want to subject to court scrutiny, but then how do they get that down to the people doing the screening at the gate?

boxes with the latest patches, firewalls and scanners installed, and
reasonable security settings.  IMO, that's a world where every day is day
zero.  All bugs are shallow, given enough qualified eyeballs, and with that
kind of money on the table, there would be plenty of eyeballs looking.
And once it's done, several thousand early adopters are out thousands of
dollars each.  This isn't much of an advertisement for the payment system.
It's anonymous and based on bearer instruments, so there's no way to run
the fraudulent transactions back.  The money's gone, and the attackers are
richer, and the next, more demanding round of attacks has been capitalized.
They also have to be able to do something about it.  What would you tell a
reasonably bright computer programmer with no particular expertise in
security about how to keep a bearer asset as valuable as his car stored
securely on a networked computer?  If you can't give him an answer that
will really work in a world where these bearer assets are  common, you're

I'm still trying to understand the moral theory on which you differentiate hitting the two towers from the Oklaholma City bombing.  McVeigh (not a branch davidian) wanted to strike back at the BATF for the Waco massacre, so he killed a whole bunch of people, a few of whom were BATF employees, but not, as far as I know, anyone directly involved in the decisions that led to all the deaths in Waco.  The 9/11 hijackers wanted to strike at the US for a variety of reasons, probably mostly that we're a big, visible target, but presumably also that we're propping up states like Saudi Arabia.  So they killed a whole bunch of people, most of whom had nothing to do with what they opposed, but surely including people who were doing business with Saudi Arabia and Israel.
If McVeigh had used a sniper rifle to kill the specific BATF agent who called for the raid/media event on the Branch Davidians' compound, I'd still think he deserved to either die or spend his life in prison, but at least I could somehow fathom the moral decision to do what he'd done--like the pro-life terrorists (ah, the irony) who assassinate abortionists.  They need to be locked up, but you can at least see what they were thinking.  Blowing up a building full of random people because a few of them are associated with some action you really disagree with is just outside the realm of the sort of moral decision I can figure out.

Now, this causes no problem for me--OBL, Tim McVeigh, the Unabomber, they all look like remorseless murderers to me, and I see the differences between them mainly in terms of how effective and dangerous they are.  I don't know if this was a goal, exactly, but the other thing the 9/11 attacks achieved was to scare the hell out of the power elite in the country, especially the people at the top of government, media, and finance.  That made all kinds of dumb responses (some parts of the Patriot act, Bush's breathtaking claim of the power to lock up citizens without trial, his administration's equally breathtaking claim that he could ignore laws and treaties against torture on his authority, the invasion of Iraq) possible.

I think this bit gets at the heart of why the Islamic fundamentalists are hard to deal with.  For most people I know, some notion of peace and prosperity is the thing we want from our governments.  Different people differ on how to do that (like, whether the government should employ most of the doctors or the teachers),  but that's the kind of goal that makes sense.  And that's largely what the West has to offer.  Not membership in a master race, or a date with destiny, or as vision of yourself as part of a great, centuries-old Jihad, but safe streets, working sewers, functioning markets, and a rising tide that promises to life all boats eventually, so that one day, your poor people, like ours, will be overweight from spending too much time sitting in front of the TV in an air conditioned room.  The Islamic fundamentalists can't offer that.  A country run by these guys is just not going to be in the forefront of technology, its economy will grow slowly, and it's likely to always be close to going to war with some infidels around it.  No peace, not much prosperity, but a lot of capital-P Purpose.  A place in history, a part of the Jihad.  In this sense, it's a lot like Marxism was, back when it had serious adherents; it's a mass movement, like Eric Hoffer talks about.  What Hayek called the liberal order (e.g., working minimal government, liberal democracy, rule of law) can't offer any of that.   It offers safe streets and working sewers and peace and prosperity, but you have to come up with your own purpose.  The irony is that the neocons seemed to be trying to build up a kind of mass movement mentality in the US, which clearly has caught George Bush and his top advisors--this wonderful notion that we're going to go out and civilize these heathens, bring them democracy and free markets, and then they'll stop wanting to be part of crazy mass movements that tell them to strap dynamite to themselves and blow up bus stops full of people.

I don't know about other peoples' objections to this, but mine mainly involve my belief that this is an expensive and not very effective way to deal with terrorism.  Well, the question is, what ought they to be doing with it.  Invading Iraq to build a democracy there, in hopes of somehow fixing the root causes of terrorism (as similarly goofy idealists on the left once thought they could do for crime in the US), looks like a waste of time and money.  I suspect we're causing ourselves more problems, as Iraq is not only a place where terrorists can go to attack the US and be attacked by us in turn, it's also a place where there are lots of people learning the basic skills of being a terrorist, gaining some experience in doing so, etc.  Do you think we're going to kill all of those people?  Do you think they'll all abandon terrorist tactics when things quiet down in Iraq?  I know the Republican line these days is that we're safer because the bad guys are all shooting at Marines in Iraq, rather than at civilians in Des Moines.  But that only makes sense if we don't end up with a much bigger problem later, as a result.  Perhaps we should all have rested more secure in our beds when the jihadis were streaming into Afghanistan, where they would be killed in large numbers by the Red Army.

You seem to have rediscovered the fact that crypto can move trust around, but can't create any.  You have to decide to trust someone for it to be useful.  The great problem with practically using this stuff is getting someone that you're comfortable trusting, who can then use crypto to move the trust around in a sensible way.  The condition necessary for Verisign certificates to have a lot of trust, to me, is for the appearance of a fraudulent Verisign certificate to be a major scandal, leading to the CEO getting canned, the stock price dropping by some large fraction, and a huge fall-off of business for their CA.  When that isn't the case (for the high security certs; it's clearly silly to expect it for low-security ones), the CA doesn't have as much incentive as I'd like to be careful about forgeries.  You'd like the exposure of a fraudulent certificate signed by a CA to have the same kind of effect as the exposure of a bank being unable to produce the money a depositor demands.  Fraudulent certificates issued for any purpose--whether furnishing fake IDs to FBI agents, or to Al Qaida terrorists, or to random Nigerian-scam operators--leave a permanent trail; the recipient of the certificate can show it around when he discovers it's fraudulent.  If the last step of this protocol for the CA is "and then you go out of business," the incentives not to issue fraudulent certificates looks right.

I guess I've been surprised this issue hasn't seen a lot more discussion.

Yep.  It turns out that broad and scary police powers don't make you any smarter or wiser or more careful, they just make it easier for you to insist on obedience and stifle complaints.  Post 9/11, flight attendants and airline employees have more authority to order passengers around and deny people boarding, but they're still the same people they were on 9/10, they're presumably only marginally better at spotting terrorists (at least not obviously Arab-looking terrorists).  They just have more power, and fewer consequences when they screw up.

The best defense would seem to be a population with a lot of TVs and radios.  At least after the first tsunami hit, the news would quickly spread, and there were several hours between when the waves arrived at different shores.  (And a 9.0 earthquake on the seafloor, or even a 7.0 earthquake on the seafloor, is a rare enough event that it's not crazy to at least issue a "stay off the beach" kind of warning.)  My first take on this is that it's an example of the many ways that it's better to be in a rich country than a poor one.  Major natural disasters are a lot bloodier in poor countries, for lots of infrastructure reasons (good communications to get out the warning, good roads to evacuate on, resources available for disaster planning long before the disaster hits, building codes or best practices that require some resistance to known disasters, etc.).

Interesting questions:  How hard is it for someone to actually hit an airplane with a rifle bullet?  How often do airplane maintenance people notice bulletholes?  My understanding is that a single bullethole in a plane is not likely to do anything serious to its operation--the hole isn't big enough to depressurize the cabin of a big plane, and unless it hits some critical bits of the plane, it's not going to cause mechanical problems.   I don't think the bigger .50 round would fundamentally change that.  So this could be one of those things that just happens from time to time, without getting much press.  (Most people have never heard of phantom controllers either, but they're a real phenomenon, and they seem at least as dangerous as some nut with a rifle taking potshots at landing planes.)   --John

I just wonder what the false negative rates are.  Seem like a gun that has a 1% chance of refusing to fire when you *really need it* might not be worth all that much.  Similarly, one that you can't get to work if you've got a band-aid on your finger, or a cut on your hand, or whatever, loses a lot of its value.  On the other hand, a gun that can't be made to go off by your toddler is a pretty huge win, assuming you're willing to trust the technology, but a 90% accuracy level sounds to me like 10% of the time, your three year old can, in fact, cause the thing to go off.  That's not worth much, but maybe they'll get it better.   And the "suspect struggles with cop, gets gun, and shoots cop" problem would definitely be helped by a guy that wouldn't go off for 90% of attackers.

@_subject: /. [Intel Adds DRM to New Chips] 
Right.  This has to happen if you want the basic DRM model to work.
The big thing to understand here is that the content protection people
are okay with the model of the world where a relatively small number
of pirates with a lot of capital and expertise can crack out content
and make copies for sale.  They already live in that world, and the
analog hole makes it genuinely impossible for them to get out of it.
The world that they want to avoid living in is the one where the only
capital required to become a major pirate is a PC.  The difference here is in two parts:  When pirates have to have a lot
of capital, they have to charge for their pirated works.  So the
difference isn't "pay $15 for a new CD or just do download it," it's
"pay $15 for a new CD or pay $3 for a new CD."  And then the pirate
has to worry about getting paid, which means dealing with some kind of
(in practice traceable) payment protocol if he wants to do business
online.  And shutting down pirates who have $500,000 invested in their
business actually makes some financial sense--you can spend a few
thousand dollars shutting them down without spending yourself into
bankruptcy.  By contrast, the world in which every PC owner can be a pirate is much
nastier for the content owners.  Being a pirate is so easy that the
resulting ripped music files are made available for free, just as part
of someone joining a P2P network or some such thing.  That means the
user gets a decision like "Buy a CD for $15, which I will then want to
rip so I can put it on my laptop and MP3 player anyway, or just
download it for free."  The pirates aren't charging anything, so they
don't have to worry about getting paid or being traced by their
payment mechanism.  And enforcement actions against pirates in this
world are comically inefficient--you end up spending thousands of
dollars to shut down one 14 year old with a PC, and all the money you
can spend doesn't really have much impact on the problem.  You're left
trying to make examples of a few people, which makes you look like
bullies, and which is unlikely to work all that well anyway.  Right.  The critical issue here is whether a random user can just
download some software to defeat the DRM.  If it costs lots of money
to extract the DRM secrets, there's some question of whether the
people who spent that money will release the keys into the wild for
free.  And many schemes have at least some notion of revoking keys
that have been released into the wild, so that your new CDs don't play
with the hacked DRM server.  The point of all this isn't to stop determined pirates--that's
impossible because of the analog hole.  The point is to stop casual
piracy.  That seems at least possibly doable to me.  (The big question
is whether the existence of non-DRMed copies of lots of content will
make it possible to just *ignore* the DRMed stuff.)

Drivers license security is being pursued because a bunch of people
want to be able to reliably use drivers licenses as ID cards for their
own purposes.  That can be for TSA screening of passneger names
(though I think it's fantasy to imagine that this will really prevent
terrorists from flying, and it has endless creepy totalitarian uses),
or for making it harder to get a bank account without submitting your
true name so you get taxed and monitored, or making it easier for
the folks running various "preferred shopper" card programs to make
you give them the right information, or keeping you from reselling
your airline tickets.  (Note that the whole market segmentation/price
discrimination scheme that this threatened has basically died by now,
but we're still stuck with binding names to airline tickets.)  This is *very* dependent on the cultures in question.  For the most
part, Japanese and Korean immigrants (to take a couple easy examples)
make wonderful neighbors, though they're members of a different race
and culture and often a different religion.  On the other hand, turn
of the century Irish immigrants were English-speaking Christians, but
they made nightmarish neighbors.  And neither of those have much to do
with terrorism (as opposed to low-level crime, public drunkenness,
imported criminal gangs, etc.).  The Irish in the US have never been
much of a terrorist threat, though things are very different in the
UK!  Well, it depends on what your goal is.  If your goal is
harder-to-forge drivers licenses for all kinds of good and bad
purposes, then it may help.  If your goal is seriously stopping
terrorism or shutting down illegal immigration, it probably won't have
much of an impact.

They have different requirements.  Votes and cash transactions and similar things require no history, no reputation.  They're one-shot actions that should not be linkable to other actions.  Pseudonyms are used everywhere in practice, because even my name is effectively a pseudonym unless you have some reason to try to link it to a meatspace human.  This is why it's worth reading a book by Mark Twain, even though that wasn't his real
name.  And it would be worth reading those books even if we had no idea who had really
written them.  The reuptation and history of the author lets you decide whether you want
to read the next of his books.  The same is true of academic papers--you don't need to have met me or even to be able to find me, in order to read my papers and develop an opinion (hopefully a good one) about the quality of my work.  And that determines whether
you think the next paper is worth reading.

It seems like the real question is how membership in the class is determined.  If anyone who's acting like a reporter in a certain context (say, Adam Shostack interviewing me for his blog) qualifies, then I don't see the constitutional problem, though it may still be good or bad policy.  If you've got to get a special card from the government that says you're a journalist, it seems like that's more of a problem.  I guess other places where there's some right not to answer these questions exist, but they're mostly based on licensed professions.  I gather your lawyer or priest has much more ability to refuse to talk than your doctor or accountant, and that your psychologist has a shockingly small ability to refuse to talk.  Other than priest, though, all these fields are at least somewhat licensed by the state for other reasons, so that makes it easy to use possession of a license as a way to tell when someone really is a doctor, lawyer, psychologist, etc.  For constitutional reasons, that's not really true for journalists.

More to the point, an irreversible payment system raises big practical
problems in a world full of very hard-to-secure PCs running the
relevant software.  One exploitable software bug, properly used, can
steal an enormous amount of money in an irreversible way.  And if your
goal is to sow chaos, you don't even need to put most of the stolen
money in your own account--just randomly move it around in
irreversible, untraceable ways, making sure that your accounts are
among the ones that benefit from the random generosity of the attack.
The payment system operators will surely be sued for this, because
they're the only ones who will be reachable.  They will go broke, and
the users will be out their money, and nobody will be silly enough to
make their mistake again.

Well, one difference is that those transactions can often be undone,
if imperfectly at times.  The whole set of transactions is logged in
many different places, and if there's an attack, there's some
reasonable hope of getting the money back.  And that said, there have
been reports of spyware stealing passwords for online banking systems,
and of course, there are tons of phishing and pharming schemes to get
the account passwords in a more straightforward way.   The point is,
if you're ripped off in this way, there's a reasonable chance you can
get your money back, because the bank has a complete record of the
transactions that were done.  There's no chance of this happening when
there's no record of the transaction anywhere.  I don't think so.  Suppose there's a widespread attack that steals
money from tens of thousands of users of this payment technology.
There seem to be two choices:
a.  The payment system somehow makes good on their losses.
b.  Everyone who isn't dead or insane pulls every dime left in that
system out, knowing that they could be next.  It's not even clear that these are mutually exclusive, but if (a)
doesn't happen, (b) surely will.  Nobody wants their money stolen, and
I don't think many people are so confident of their computer security
that they're willing to bet huge amounts of money on it.  If you have
to be that confident in your computer security to use the payment
system, it's not going to have many clients.

The prerequisite for all this is that when the asset changes hands,
it's very nearly certain that this was the intention of the asset's
previous owner.  My point isn't to express my love for book-entry
payment systems.  There's plenty to hate about them.  But if the
alternative is an anonymous, irreversible payment system whose control
lies in software running alongside three pieces of spyware on my
Windows box, they probably still win for most people.  Even bad
payment systems are better than ones that let you have everything in
your wallet stolen by a single attack.  What's with the heat-death nonsense?  Physical bearer instruments
imply stout locks and vaults and alarm systems and armed guards and
all the rest, all the way down to infrastructure like police forces
and armies (private or public) to avoid having the biggest gang end up
owning all the gold.  Electronic bearer instruments imply the same
kinds of things, and the infrastructure for that isn't in place.  It's
like telling people to store their net worth in their homes, in gold.
That can work, but you probably can't leave the cheapest lock sold at
Home Depot on your front door and stick the gold coins in the same
drawer where you used to keep your checkbook.
Why do you say internet bearer transactions are more secure?  I can
see more efficient, but why more secure?  It looks to me like both
kinds of payment system are susceptible to the same broad classes of
attacks (bank misbehavior (for a short time), someone finding a
software bug, someone breaking a crypto algorithm or protocol).  What
makes one more secure than the other?  --John Kelsey
