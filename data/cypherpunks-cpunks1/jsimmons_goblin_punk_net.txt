On the subject of HTTP proxies, [SEVERAL FWD'S DELETED, ENTERTAINING SUBJECTS RETAINED]
Several popular web sites have recently turned to putting advertising
gifs on their pages. NoShit is a tool that filters these out so that
you don't see them - in fact, you don't even download them in the
first place, thus saving time, money and brain capacity.
NoShit is implemented as a set of patches against Cern httpd to turn
it into a "filtering proxy server". This means that the proxy
maintains a list of URL templates together with corresponding filter
scripts. When a document is requested form the proxy that matches one
of the templates, then the page is piped through the corresponding
script before being presented to the client. This works together with
caching, if desired.
The idea is to run your own personalized NoShit proxy server and point
your browser to it. The proxy does the filtering; the browser doesn't
even know about it. This scheme works with every browser.
I have written a ready-to-use library of filter scripts for a couple
of well known, ad-infected sites, including Yahoo, Lycos, Netscape,
HotWired, CNN, Infoseek and NandO Times. You can change these or add
your own very easily.

You know, if I worked for an organization that was dedicated to restricting
strong crypto, eliminating people's privacy rights, monitoring and recording
everything that people say or write, etc. etc. ad infinitum, I'd probably
spend at least a part of every day sitting in front of my computer in my
little cubicle somewhere in Virginia, making posts to cypherpunks just like
these ...

I'm not sure what NWBR's point is, but the original thread he's quoting
was about making the 'evaluation' copies available with 128bit RC4 to
U.S. users.  Jeff Weinstein said that he thought that this was a good idea,
and would see about making it available via an export-controlled ftp
server "once we get government approval".  I was involved in that thread,
since as a Linux user, I can't buy a supported copy, and therefore can't
take advantage of the strong crypto features of the Navigator.
So I would guess that he's spamming YOU to convince YOU to make strong
crypto available.
And as far as needing government approval, I noticed that Sameer has an
export controlled ftp server at c2.org.  Maybe he could tell us what is
necessary to setup such an animal.

Actually ;-) Barksdale going to jail would probably advance the cause of
strong cryptography more than anything I can think of.  Can you imagine
the media circus when he's led out the door in handcuffs?  A man worth
somewhere around a billion dollars being arrested for trying to give away
his product?  Court reporters trying to explain ITAR to the public?  The
mind boggles.
... and he looked over at me and said, "What are ya in for?" and I said,
"Giving away free software," and they all moved away from me on the bench ...
You guys didn't get to where you are now waiting around for HTML v3.0 to
be approved.  There must be some way to challenge an attempt to use ITAR
to stop the DOMESTIC spread of strong crypto that doesn't involve the
incarceration of your top executives ...

(Great, I'm about to argue law with a REAL LAWYER (tm).  And they promised me

OK, suppose A does NOT intend for B to export it, and he does anyway ...
Now suppose that instead of giving it to B, he SELLS it to him ...
So a pirated copy of the commercial version of Netscape's Navigator shows
up in a Hong Kong flea market, and Barksdale goes to jail ...
(Members of the jury, Mr. Barksdale MUST have known that one of his millions
of paying customers would export that dangerous munition ...)
The logical ludicrousness of ITAR shows up fast no matter which angle you
look at it from, and yet the people with the to actually challenge it aren't the big companies who stand to gain the
most financially, it's a bunch of guys (a lot of whom hang around here
sometimes) who are successfully giving away 'export controlled' software,
while the people with the resources to really fight this thing sit on the
sidelines waiting for Phil Zimmerman or Phil Karn to get them off the hook
so they can go and make a lot of money.
It seems to me that there's something very wrong with this picture, and while
I don't mean this in any way to be taken personally, one of the big things
I see as wrong is overcautious lawyers.

Then suppose you hand software to MIT to put on its export-controlled ftp
site (which would seem to follow your requirements to take reasonable
precautions to observe the ITAR, etc.) and you don't do the nudge, nudge,
wink, wink - BUT you know that it's going to be available on major ftp
sites in Europe within a few hours anyway.  The intent to export isn't there, but the export occurs anyway.  Is it the intent, or the knowledge
that's important?
Obviously the intent, or the MIT server would be in jail.
So I demonstrate lack of intent to export, by following MIT's model when I
set up my own 'export controlled' ftp server.  Am I safe?  Or do I need
a note from the NSA or somebody to do this?  And if I do need somebody or
something's 'permission', and they refuse to give it, aren't they using
ITAR to restrict the distribution domestically?  Do I have any options in
this case other than to give up?
Or, to bring it down to a practical question, what's stopping Netscape?  How
does Netscape setting up an 'export controlled' ftp site based on the MIT
version lead to one of their executives going to jail?
I have the feeling that we're talking about two different things here - the
law as it's practiced in the courtroom and the law as it's practiced on the
'streets'.  Obviously, the fact that I feel I'm doing something 'legal'
won't help much if the government decides to do a Phil Zimmerman on me.
But I would be interested in your comments.

The NSA doesn't really bother me all that much, because all they've managed
up to now is to slow things down (by about 3 hrs. in the case of PGPhone).
But what happens when someone who HAS mastered market psychology gets into
the game?
Here's a prediction:  within one year, we will see the advent of Micro$oft's
"Not So Bad Privacy".  It'll be a secret algorithm with either GAK done by
Micro$oft itself, or a flat-out trap door.  ANY communications with a Windoze box or network will have to use it, or loose the market.  About the
same time, Justice will suddenly 'loose interest' in its various investigations of M$.  Micro$oft will probably give it away for free as part
of the Windows 95.702 upgrade. At this point, the NSA's 'speed bump' becomes Micro$oft's 'brick wall'.  And
while some of us will continue to use PGP and other strong crypto, the average
American will have kissed off ALL of her privacy to the tune of "... you make
a grown man cry."

Our local University apparently has been logging ALL mail to anon.penet,

They maintain such weak security that someone was able to "obtain"

I dropped by the weekly 'meeting' of the Cal Poly SLO Computer Club (OK,

in getting people's reactions to having a large number of people's anon.penet IDs publicly posted.  What I found was kind of scary.
No one was aware of the existence of any other remailers than anon.penet.
Everyone assumed that the University is logging all mail to anon.penet, and
no one particularly cared.
One woman asked me why she should use PGP when it could be so quickly broken.
Turns out (I am NOT making this up) she didn't know the difference between
PGP and ROT_13!
Knowledge of security was limited to the technical details of setting up
systems such as Kerberos and firewalls and not using your SSN for a password.
No one had any idea of the algorithms involved, or which ones are truly
secure and which ones can be easily broken.  Etc.
These are all undergraduates in the process of getting BSCS degrees.

I, and many other Linux users that I know, have repeatedly contacted
Netscape offering to pay for a Linux version of Navigator - we have usually
been either 'brushed off' or completely ignored.  And now there is no
mention of a Linux port of v2.0 - not surprising that this 'rumor' is
running around.  I think a statement by you or someone else at Netscape
supporting a Linux version would go a long way in reassuring the Linux
community, even if it's something that is going to take a while.
And you might want to drop by the usenet comp.os.linux.* hierarchy - they're already working on ways to use your html extensions to design
web pages  that can't be read by Navigator ...

Found this on Comp.os.linux.misc - hope it's true:
In comp.infosystems. Jamie Zawinski said that there *will* be a 2.0 version for Linux.  He also explained
why Linux isn't listed and why Netscape will tell you that there
will not be a supported version of Netscape for Linux.
This is a copy of that article, which is worth reposting here, I think,
because of the large threads about this subjects:
Newsgroups: comp.infosystems.
And I replied:
Since then, it would seem that some folks have called our customer
support lines and gotten a seemingly different answer, so allow me to
When someone in customer support tells you "we will not be supporting
Linux in Netscape 2.0," they're right: but that's because we didn't
support it in 1.0 or 1.1 either.  "Support" means we sell the software,
and you can buy a support contract.  This is not, and has never been the
case for Linux.  You have never been able to get a *supported* version
of Netscape Navigator for Linux.  We have no Linux *product*; our sales
and support folks don't deal with it in any way, and never have.
However, there has been an unsupported educational/evaluation version
available for that platform, and this will also be the case for 2.0.

Precedence: bulk
        INTERNET-LINKED COMPUTERS CHALLENGE DATA ENCRYPTION STANDARD
     LOVELAND, COLORADO (June 18, 1997).  Tens of thousands of
computers, all across the U.S. and Canada, linked together via the
Internet in an unprecedented cooperative supercomputing effort to
decrypt a message encoded with the government-endorsed Data Encryption
Standard (DES).
     Responding to a challenge, including a prize of $10,000, offered by
RSA Data Security, Inc, the DESCHALL effort successfully decoded
RSADSI's secret message.
     According to Rocke Verser, a contract programmer and consultant who
developed the specialized software in his spare time, "Tens of thousands
of computers worked cooperatively on the challenge in what is believed
to be one of the largest supercomputing efforts ever undertaken outside
of government."
     Using a technique called "brute-force", computers participating in
the challenge simply began trying every possible decryption key.  There
are over 72 quadrillion keys (72,057,594,037,927,936).  At the time the
winning key was reported to RSADSI, the DESCHALL effort had searched
almost 25% of the total.  At its peak over the recent weekend, the
DESCHALL effort was testing 7 billion keys per second.
     Verser considers this project to be remarkable in two ways:
     One.  This is the first time anyone has publicly shown that they
can read a message encrypted with DES.  And this was done with "spare"
CPU time, mostly from ordinary PCs, by thousands of users who have never
even met each other.  U.S. government and industry will have to take a
hard look at their cryptographic policies.  "DES can no longer be
considered secure against a determined adversary", Verser said.
     Two.  This project demonstrates the kind of supercomputing power
that can be harnessed on the Internet using nothing but "spare" CPU
time.  "Imagine what might be possible using millions of computers
connected to the Internet!"  Aside from cryptography and other obvious
mathematical uses, supercomputers are used in many fields of science.
"Perhaps a cure for cancer is lurking on the Internet?", said Verser,
"Or perhaps the Internet will become Everyman's supercomputer."
     Under current U.S. government export regulations, and underscoring
a problem faced by the U.S. software industry, the program that searched
the keys could not be exported, except to Canada.  A competitive effort,
based in Sweden, sprang up well after the DESCHALL effort began.  Able
to "market" their keysearch software around the world, the Swedish
effort caught up quickly, and had searched nearly 10 quadrillion keys by
the end of the contest.
                   ------------------------------------
     Verser agrees with the sentiment voiced in RSADSI's secret message:
"Strong cryptography makes the world a safer place."
     Use of strong cryptography, both domestically and internationally,
is essential in today's electronic world.  "But not at the expense of a
citizen's right to privacy."  Verser adds, "Recent proposals for
'key-recovery' and for criminalization of the use of cryptography have no
place in a free society."

         INTERNET LINKED COMPUTERS CHALLENGE DATA ENCRYPTION STANDARD
             Background / Sidebar, for Release dated June 18, 1997
     The Data Encryption Standard, DES, is a national standard, adopted
in 1977.  Use of DES is mandatory in most Federal agencies, except the
military.  DES is very widely used in the private sector, as well.
     Interbank wire transfers, Visa transactions, your medical and
financial records, and your employer's financial data are some of the
many things secured against prying eyes or against modification by DES.
     When the Data Encryption Standard was adopted in 1977, there was
some question as to whether or not the Standard was adequate to protect
confidential data.
     Matt Curtin, Chief Scientist for Megasoft, Inc. says, "This is
proving by example, not by mathematical calculation, that DES can be
broken with little or no cost."  Curtin added, "Others could just as
easily be attempting to gain access to multibillion dollar wire

@_subject: DESCHALL Press Release (fwd) 
There were three main groups looking for the RSADSI key:  DESCHALL,
SOLNet (European based), and a private attack at SGI.  To my knowledge
none of them excluded keyspace the others had searched.
You might call it luck, but at the time the key was found, the combined
keyspace searched by the three groups was a bit over 50%, even counting
in the expected number of duplicate keys searched.
