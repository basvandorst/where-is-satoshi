performance pieces.  The main problem with the Cyrix/IBM is very poor math coprocessor performance.  The average user may never notice the difference but the tests and real life use of Quake show that the Cyrix/IBM is not of the same standard as the Pentium.
I have a Intel 166MMX labelled processor running just fine at 225 Mhz (75 Mhz X 3).  You can't do the same thing with Cyrix/IBM processors, maybe you can over-clock them one step.  I am a keen fan of competition in the marketplace and I have two Cyrix/IBM processors in the systems in my home.  I have not tried the AMD Pentium class processors but I intend to buy one in the near future just to play around with it.  In the past AMD was the king of over-clocking and did things with the 486 chip that Intel could not, or chose not to.  I hope AMD again gains that distinction with their Pentium class processors.  Maybe Tim May has the real inside scoop on the AMD K6 processors.  Certain segments of the market are commiting resources to the AMD K6 and you should see as many in the market as AMD can produce.  Tim May's comments on yield problems at AMD could be very true as resellers are having a problem acquiring  AMD K6s processors.  Raymond D. Mereniuk

I would think that if the Arabs didn't have Israel to hate they would find some other group.
If you go back to the late 40s you will find many political deals done by the British which didn't make a lot of sense.  The British walking out of Burma and turning political control over to whoever the goofs are that ruined that country made no sense whatsoever.  The British turned political control of Malaysia over to the ethnic Malays where the Malays are not the original people of that region.  The Malays were immigrants much like most of the Chinese, they just got there 300 years earlier.  Falling oil prices probably hurt the USA and Soviet governments more than any possible benefit.  The Soviets export oil so they are hurting.  The US and most other western style democracies tax oil products based on its wholesale cost and retail selling pricing so they would see reduced revenues.
You can add possible large reserves in the Canadian Arctic.  The oil companies started to find it and they tried to think of a way to transport it.  The Canadian gov't vetoed all the transportation alternatives so the oil companies stopped exploration.
The middle east countries do have the oil reserves with the lowest cost of production.  Most reserves in North American are moderate to high cost of production.
Now if you want to be paranoid....   Before the 70s energy crisis we all drove big cars which had no problem doing the 65 MPH speed limit and back then we used to pass on two-lane highways.  The energy crisis came and we all accepted gutless foreign made small cars which consumed less energy and had a problem with the 55 MPH speed limit and passing was impossible on a two-lane highway even if we found a section which was not double-lined.  Now we have cheap oil.  Big powerful vehicles are back and we are not embarrassed to consume energy any more.  I have no idea where society is heading but I do like have a more powerful vehicle which capable of passing a vehicle already doing 65 MPH.
The whole Greens or tree-hugger thing is a bit hypocritical.  Ask them if they have electrical appliances in their home and the answer is always yes.

With Traceroute if a host name is not received, when requested of course, it is because the equipment was not assigned a host name or it is deliberately suppressed.  I don't use Traceroute a lot but this is the first time I have seen host names suppressed.  A lot of routers have ICM suppressed and will not provide a device name.

In recent years California citizens have decided against new electric power generation  projects  within their jurisdiction and to enforce strict air pollution standards on any existing facilities.

The bad decisions of the citizens of California have produced an energy crisis in what is called the Northwest for which all citizens in what is called the Northwest must pay the price.

Actually if California had been building power plants in recent years we would not have this short term price issue.  If they had built a power plant they would have committed to a supplier of natural gas who would have arranged a supply (drill wells) and arranged delivery (build pipeline capacity).  The problem now is no one in California made commitments so the market did not build supply and delivery capacity. California consumers are now forced to purchase their requirements in a commodity market causing the current distortions.
The consumer price for natural gas here is based on the delivery price at Sumas Washington which is a pipeline crossing into the USA and a major supply point to California.  The cost to heat my home will have more than doubled by January 1st.  The price I must pay is heavily influenced by demand in California.  It is always cold here and the furnace is even used in the summer.  There are more people in California than in all of Canada and most Canadians live on the other side of the continent.  This market is much too small to influence the price of natural gas.  In the past natural gas prices were determined by the price of oil.  When oil prices were low exploration companies had less capital available for exploration.  In general exploration companies only search for natural gas when they have delivery contracts.  Collection systems, pipelines, are only built when there is a market for the natural gas.  If natural gas power plants were built in California the gas would be available.  If oil prices had been higher in recent years exploration companies would have probably have attempted to build reserves of natural gas but chances are the delivery system would not be in place so there would still be a shortage.
Natural gas is a good choice but maybe not the best.  While natural gas is considered clean burning the emissions for even a smaller plant is measured in the thousands of tonnes per year.  There is some risk involved with pipelines, if they break there is always a fire if not an explosion.  There will now be significant political pressure to bring Alaskan natural gas to the California market, lots of issues here to keep the liberal tree huggers busy for years.  There are only two ways to get it to the market, pipeline or liquidify it and use a tanker.  I believe I would rather have nuclear power plant in my neighbourhood than a liquidified natural gas facility.
It would be nice if you could wave a magic wand and separate markets, but that cure would be probably worse than the disease.  The current pricing issue is a short term one.  A few years of higher prices and the market will response with more supply and delivery capacity.  I have done the wood stove thing and it is a bunch of work plus it is very hard on air quality.  Coal fired furnaces are less work but very hard on air quality.  It would be nice if Californians took responsibility for their lifestyle, built the power plants in California and dealt with environmental issues themselves.  You have a choice, if you don't want power plants, don't use power.

In the energy business it is commonly assumed there is lots of natural gas in Alberta and BC.  So much that most exploration companies do not bother looking for it until they has a market.  In the business it is often jokingly stated that natural gas will be obsolete before we release it all from the reservoirs.
If you decide to build a natural gas powered electrical generation facility to provide full-time capacity you are looking at a lead-time of at least a couple of years.  With a lead time of two years the supply would be available.  The delivery system may be a problem as in this day and age it can take more than two years to get approval to build pipelines in populated areas.  Put your power plant in the boonies and you solve part of the problem.
Basically there are two natural gas delivery systems coming out of Canada.  The main system starts in northeast British Columbia on the east side of the continental divide, runs through Alberta collecting more capacity and then heads east.  There is a branch going to Toronto and Montreal, the main population centres in Canada.  There is another branch which heads to the Chicago area.
If you check your commodity prices you will note buyers attached to this system pay much lower prices than those offered to California buyers.  There is no shortage of supply in this system, you can tell by the prices.
California is not directly connected to this supply system and can not benefit from this abundant supply.  On this side of the continental divide there is no longer an abundant supply.  One of the local gas transmission companies wanted Canadian consumers to pay CAN$500 million to increase supply through increased residential and industrial rates.  We the consumers refused as we didn't need the capacity for our own use.  The transmission company wanted the consumers to assume their risk with our dollars.  The transmission company invested some of their own capital to do part of the connection.  If you want to give them CAN$325 million they will finish finish the link between the two systems and there will be a glut of natural gas on this side of the continental divide.  They know if they invest the money themselves they will loose their current price premium so they ain't doin it with their money.  Commit to some long-term supply contracts at today's prices and it would completed within a year.
I live out in the burbs in what was once a rural area.  No one ever thought the city would grow this big.  Many years ago they built a coal fired power plant less than a couple of miles away.  It was down wind from the city and no one cared about the pollution back then...   Around about 10 years ago they changed from coal to natural gas fired boilers.  This power plant sits there mainly unused.  The local tree hugger types whine too much about the pollution.  The facility is not small, probably enough capacity for a city of 250K.  It is used only at peak times and in emergency situations.  When there are low reservior levels (which is part of your problem) it is used more often.
In a properly planned electrical system this type of extra capacity is considered essential.  These plants were never intended to be used fulltime so they tend to have low natural gas storage capacity and smaller inbound pipelines.  In your system you are using facilities such as these for full-time power generation.  In your state these plants has a quota of pollution they are allowed to produce on an annual basis.  A number of these facilities had reached their annual quota of emissions so they shut down for maintenance.  Since they were never intended to be used full-time they require some down time.  Within the last two weeks your state government lifted the pollution quotas and pressured the operators to bring these plants back on stream.
You caught me by surprise on this one.  I assume you are talking about electricity as if a gas delivery system has losses you tend to very quickly become aware of it.
I don't believe my view is anything other than an accurate description of what is plainly stated between the lines.  In this part of the world there are very detailed analysis printed in the local media describing the mechanics of what is happening in the energy market.  Just from your reaction you can see why this view would not be popular in your neighbourhood.  Energy production is big business in western Canada and a lot of people are making big dollars from the consumers in the northwest. The actions of the California voters have made this possible.  I just wish I was still in the energy business rolling in dollars rather than whining about paying an extra $1,000 per year for heating.

Compared to California markets this is a small market.  Two million folks in the metro area and 3 million total in the province (state).  The size of the market makes nuclear power impractical.  BC is a net exporter of energy.  Lots of electricity, some oil and some natural gas.  They have dammed a bunch of waterways.
Everyone gets excited about the dangers of nuclear power plants.  In areas where sour natural gas is produced there is a lot of environmental damage.  The original reason for settling Canada was to trap animals, skin them and sell the furs to Europe.  Fur trappers didn't care if you dammed the rivers and poisoned the air and ground with hydrogen sulphate.
If you work around sour gas you are advised that if your co-worker suddenly collapses you don't attempt to help him as he is probably already dead.  You are advised to run upwind as fast as possible.  They find cattle raised near sour gas wells and production facilities suffer from a significant increase in birth defects and still borns.  There is some evidence appearing that man suffers the same problems as the animals.
I have lived and worked around gas plants and sour gas production facilities.  I have done my hazardous duty.  Again, until you witness the environmental damage associated with the energy business you have no idea...
This is my second go around on the energy boom cycle.  The only reason you are paying more is because of bad planning or producers not being allowed to build capacity when they wanted.  There is no shortage, just some distribution problems.
Being that BC and Alberta are big energy exporters there are lots of folks, and organizations, making big money on the current problems.  I don't believe "around the world" is factual.  There is lots of natural gas in the distribution system which is not connected to Problem with propane is that it stinks so bad and it puts out a lot of moisture when burnt.  Propane is a commodity and it has seen some wild fluctuation in recent years.  I lived in the tropics for 8 years.  I prefer the temperate rain forest where I currently reside.  I like cool and rainy.  One of my complaints about Vancouver is that it doesn't rain enough, too many nice sunny days.  The problem with hot places is you can only take off so much clothing and you will still be hot.  In cold climates you can put on more clothes and eat red meat to keep warm.
The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) paid for a series of dams whose main purpose was to hold water for their power generation system.  This series of dams were completed in the late 60s and they paid a set fee for the first 30 years of water rights or downstream benefits.  After 30 years the downstream benefits were to be returned to BC or BPA had the option to purchase those benefits.  The downstream benefits were to be returned to BC as Initially BPA promised $250 million for some set term and BC agreed to take the money.  At the last minute BPA decided the benefits were not worth the offered price and advised BC to accept less or take the power.  BC took the power.  BPA made this decision when it appeared electricity was a commodity with an ever decreasing price.  Good management team, I bet they got a bonus for this deal.
On a more serious note these dams have created significant environmental impact.  They turned hundreds of miles of river into lakes part of the year and made a big mess.  No one is complaining now that we receive the full whack of downstream benefits.  Actually there was not many complaints in 30 years.
There are no chip companies manufacturing here.  They have design centers in Vancouver as there are enough skilled workers to make the effort worth the expense.  Your hunch was wrong, BC and Alberta are big energy exporters even though Alberta is experiencing some shortfall in electrical generating capacity.  Raymond D. Mereniuk

In my initial message I stated the current rise in natural gas prices are caused by multiple factors.  Natural gas prices were too low in recent years and this caused a shortage in supply.  Narural gas has gained in popularity with utility companies in recent years because it is clean (relatively) and it is cheaper and easier to implement natural gas burning technologies than other fuel source technologies, ie - coal which would be cheaper but more difficult to meet current emission standards and "current" public expectations. On top of these factors I stated the greater portion of the increase was created by un-expected demand in California.  Another issue in this problem, as in this month and next, is low water levels in the northwest causing lower than expected power generating capacity.
In the past natural gas power plants were viewed as temporay or part-time solutions as they are relatively  cheap to construct.  If you have a power plant you don't expect to use you don't commit to much of a supply as you don't expect to use the plant.  At this time many auxiliary power plants in California and surrounding states are being utilitized to generate power for the California market.  There was recently a federal mandate that power suppliers in neighbouring markets not refuse to provide power to California Coupled with the low water situation, and the resulting decrease in hydro generated power, the increased use of natural gas powered generating capacity would be expected to cause an increase in the price of a commodity in which the increase in demand was unexpected or exceeded supply.
If a power generating utility had built new power plants and commited to a fuel supply (and the accompanying infrastructure) the likelihood of unexpected prices increases would be much lower.

Almost true but not the complete story. While the provincially (state) owned utility BC Hydro owns most of the capacity there is an entity called East Kootenay Power which services a portion of the province (state).
Unfortunately the politicians still control the power business in BC and have done everything in their power to discourage co-
generation and other alternative suppliers.  Fortunately there is no shortage of supply.

I don't know where you get your information but I doubt your statements.  California is a net exporter of power is suspect, lets see the details here.  BC never imports power!  You must travel around this place and then you will understand, every major water way is blocked and producing power.  Couple this with the low population and you have low demand.  The Bonneville Power Authority (BPA) is required to return downstream benefits to BC but this has nothing to do with our requirements.  It is payment for the water management services supplied to their power generation system.  Any power returned to BC is probably promptly exported.
On this angle you are wrong, BC is a net power exporter in both electrical and natural gas realms.
BC has not built new power plants in a long time.  There is so much supply here that it was official policy to discourage any co-
generation or alternative electrical supply development. Yes markets are not simple which is probably the reason you fail to see the California component in the current situation.  The energy market doesn't lend itself to Economics 101.
Sorry, this is where you are showing your Childishly naive understanding of the energy business.  In the energy business (natural gas wise) if you commit to the supply and build infrastructure you get lower prices.  I re-state my initial premise, Californians have a lot to learm about energy economics!  If you don't commit, you pay more!

This appears to be an overly optimistic estimate of revenue whether it is 3 or 4 years.  They tried photo radar in Ontario and they had very high estimates of revenue which were never achieved.  People slowed down for the photo radar locations as they were typically easy to spot.  The Ontario program was cancelled within a short period of time after a change in provincial (state) government.
The photo radar program in British Columbia was very recently cancelled as it was not considered a success.  It failed to meet its revenue forecasts and the managers of the program demanded a major increase in the number of vans (photo radar units) to enable the program to be a success.  The government of the time cancelled the expansion plans.
The program had many problems other than enforcing arbitrary speed limits imposed for political reasons.  The government which initiated the program promised not to run speed traps, ie - place the units at the bottom of hills or within 200 meters of a speed zone change other than school and playground zones.  The biggest issue working against the program was most drivers learned to recognize the vans and were alert to their presence.
Another issue was legally serving a ticket on the owner of the offending vehicle.  If you are stopped by a police office and issued a ticket you are legally served with the appropriate documentation in the eyes of the law.  The BC photo radar program mailed tickets to the offenders.  This is not considered being legally served so many people threw the tickets out.  Initially a local police office would then serve the ticket to your door but this didn't last long as the volume grew.
Process servers were then used which worked in small towns and rural areas as everyone knew each other.  In the big cities a process server had very little luck as people learned all they to do was tell the process server the intended recipient was not home.  Even if the process server catches you getting into the same vehicle as pictured by the photo radar you state you are not the recipient as you are just using the vehicle.
Next the government tried denying driver's license renewal or license tags or insurance if you had outstanding fines.  That didn't work either as they can't penalize you for something you are not aware of in a legal sense.  The front counter folks would hard line you on this one but all you had to do was ask for a supervisor.
What is interesting in this article is the the assumed 75% payment rate.  If you break the law and you are fined you would expect an almost 100% payment rate, its a Law & Order issue.  If the motivation is revenue generation it would appear a lower payment rate may be acceptable.
A personal statement - While photo radar is just an easy way for law enforcement to go throw the motions red-light cameras may be a necessary evil.  Within this urban area people running red-lights has gotten totally out of hand.  I see people running lights 5 or more seconds after my light turns green, even passing cars stopped in nearby lanes.  If you are first in line at a light you must look both ways before proceeding on a green.  If red-light cameras are done right and can accurately pin-point the offending vehicle, done with a another photo one second or so after the first, they may what is required to get people to play by the necessary rules.
I did read a previous article where it was mentioned the existing cameras, and associated system,  were not setup properly and wrongly sent tickets to folks who were not guilty of any traffic violations.  Like I mentioned above, it must be done right where there is no doubt on who is guilty and who is not.
I doubt very much Washington will go from issuing 10,000 traffic citations to 80,000 citations per month.  Drivers will get a ticket or two and change their ways, or learn where the photo units are located.  If the process rules are as loose as they are in BC people would have no reason to pay other than to eliminate some hassle.

The Ztrace software is probably much the same as the Computrace software from Absolute Software located in Vancouver BC.  The Computrace software was discussed on this list a number of years ago, before the call home thru the Net feature was added.
There is 20 to 40 KB of unused space in the system area of any AT type formated hard drive, same area, or nearby, to where your partition information is written on the hard drive.  This area is normally not over-written when you use Fdisk to partition a hard drive or when you do a high level format.
The software is loaded into this area.  The software is configured to call home base, the security service provider (SSP), on a pre-
determined basis.  When it calls home it basically identifies itself and asks for instructions.  In normally circumstances it is given none.
If an asset is reported stolen and then calls home it is instructed to call home on a more frequent basis.  If it calls home via a telephone line the SSP gets the calling from number from ANI.  If you terminate incoming digital telephone lines (T1) in a Telco system compatible device you will be given the ANI, Automatic Number Identification.  You can't block ANI.  If it calls home via the Net they get an IP address.  Either way the location of the remote asset is easily determined.
When they get a location they contact the nearest local law enforcement agency, explain the situation and normally the local law seizes the asset.  I use asset as this type of product is marketed for use in desktop and server type computers.  It is also marketed to insurance companies, want a discount on the policy, just load this software and keep this number handy incase you lose it.
I figure it can be removed if you know it is there.  I have no direct experience so I can't speak with any authority.  Last time this was discussed in this forum it was thought the Linux Fdisk would delete it.  I have some other tools for deleting disk partitions which I figure would work plus there was some low-level format programs for certain brands of IDE hard drives which would probably work on older model hard drives.  A good guess would be anything which could delete a Disk Manager boot record would delete this Raymond D. Mereniuk

If you check out the mfn.org web site, Missouri FreeNet, you will note Mr. Terranson is Mr. MFN, or at least one of them.  Mr. Terranson has over 20 years experience in the BBS and Internet business.  A real pioneer you might state.  He either has no humor or he fails to completely understand what he reads.  I find many of the anti-spam folk to be as bad as the spammers.  Where do you draw the line?  If people are so keen to jump on spammers they fail to properly understand the nature of a post you have a big problem.  Imagine what would happen if your local police force was given authority to police spammers?  If the police had the intellectual ability of Mr. Terranson many Cypherpunks would soon be in jail in a digital age version of the A long time ago, or what seems a long time ago, I supported the notion that the Cypherpunk list be moderated.  At the time a major concern was 2 or 3 or 4 posts a day from an anonymous source disparaging the character of Tim May.  It was assumed the source of the posts was Dimitri Vulis (spelling?).  It was decided that there should be moderation and I thought it would be good.  I now understand the problems with that approach.  The question is how do you deal with spam?  The anti-spam folks are looking more like bigoted Nazis racing to launch complaints on anything resembling spam.  Lots of users will complain to their ISP when the ISP implements anti-spam measures as their mailbox is obvious broke as there are no messages in it.
I try not to read spam and would never buy anything from anyone who spams or calls me at home.  I would love to be forever rid of spam but don't believe we can trust politicians to write the right law.  Idealistically we could all not buy anything from spammers and eventually they would realize there was no return from spam and stop but some newbie schmuck is always going to buy something from the spammers so that won't work.  Anyone have any thoughts on eliminating spam other than filters and hitting the delete key or button?

Oops.  I sent a message earlier, before noticing this message, where some remarks did not hold Mr. Terranson in the highest regard.  This appears to be a misunderstanding between Declan and Mr. Terranson.  I apologize for any remarks using Mr. Terranson as an example.  I believe my comments are still valid with the references to Mr. Terranson removed.
My apologises to Mr. Terranson.
I mean what would you expect from a representative of FBN Technical Services!!
