@_subject: Information 
Dear Cypherpunks:
I'm new here and without taking too much bandwidth, I'd like to ask you for
some assistance.  I am wondering if there is a precise way of figuring out
where a web/mail server is based, or at least get some identifying
information.  I think I saw some messages on this list a few weeks ago about
how easy it is to identify a server or ISP, with just an address (web or
e-mail address).  Is this possible and how?  I would appreciate any guidance
you may provide and I hope this request is not too much against the
etiquette of this group.  Thank you.

@_subject: PR Firm To Tame Net 
Did anyone on this list read the SF Chronicle article a few days ago about a
PR firm, that "tames rogue Web sites".  It monitors the Web for these sites,
finds the people who created them and tries to convince them to go offline.
"if gentle persuasion doesn't wprk", said the founder, "you need to bring in
the lawyers".  He gives the example of a Kmart Sucks site, created by a
disgruntled employee, and the First Boston site where a former employee
published proprietary salary figures...I guess he doesn't know that making
derogatory comments is LEGAL.
You know, we were talking these days about the Net putting the masses back
in mass media...this guy says these days are over.  His e-mail address is
m.a at ix.netcom.com.
