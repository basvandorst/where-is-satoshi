Overturns the part of the Brady Bill that forces local officials

The press would have you believe that it was Larry Flynt and his million-dollar tales of infidelity that caused the unexpected change in House leadership
this month, but encryption policy buffs -- paranoid by nature and proud of it -- are beginning to focus on another suspect, one with more to gain.  That's because it is the Federal Bureau of Investigation that looks like the
biggest winner now that Robert Livingston has been replaced by Dennis
Hastert as
odds-on favorite to be Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Livingston supported the industry's version of SAFE, the crypto decontrol
bill that died in Congress last session.  In contrast, J. Dennis Hastert (R-IL)
has shown strong solidarity with the FBI on encryption issues as a member of the
House Commerce Committee.  Indeed, Hastert supported the Oxley-Manton
Amendment that would have turned the SAFE Act of 1997 (H. R. 695) into a mandate for domestic regulation of encryption.  And when Oxley-Manton was rejected by
the Committee in favor of the Markey-White Amendment, Hastert voted against the SAFE Act.

As attractive as this might be as a conspiracy theory, Flint pretty much
admitted he had the goods in this case (and claims to have similar stuff on
something like 7 or 8 other Republicans and 1 democrat).  He's investing
a lot of his own funds in this particular little enterprise of his.
He's apparently quite pissed off that this one leaked before he was able to
use the content himself.  (after all, as a publisher, the reason you develop
content is to use it in print yourself primarily).  A more interesting question is how the White House found out about the
a few days before it came out.  (which apparently is how Roll Call which ran
the story first got ahold of it).  There have been persistent rumors of a
White House controlled black operation to uh, bring pressure upon, certain
people that are in positions to embarrass the President.  Apparently at
some of this sort of activity has gone on for a long time, perhaps since the
President was in Arkansas.  Whether the FBI would be involved in *that* is an interesting question.  I doubt it, because the risk of public exposure in that situation would be
enormous, and there was already an FBI-related scandal early in this
administration.  Also the Administrator over there is regarded as somewhat
a loose cannon by the folks in the White House.  So I kind of suspect the
would not be involved in White House led black ops.  And I doubt the
would be involved either (given this President's relations with them.)  So
reports of private detectives and other non-government people spearheading
squares with what would be rationally expected.
I think the FBI may merely have either just gotten lucky and dodged a bullet
on this one, -or- they had a deeper cover role in passing the stuff to
people (undoubtably private individuals, so evidence, if it existed in FBI
files, could've been fed to someone on the "outside").  Given that no one
that Livingston was going to be in the position he was in till several days
*after* the election, that's reasonably quick response if that is really

Nations strive to limit freedom of the Internet By David L. Marcus, Globe Staff
WASHINGTON - As promised, the Internet is turning into an unstoppable geyser of information, a source of data, news and opinions that flow freely around the world.
Except in China, which blocks access to sites about Tibet, Taiwan, democratic movements and dissident groups.
Except in Saudi Arabia, which censors sites critical of the royal family.
Except in Germany, where a judge sentenced a CompuServe manager to two years in prison for allowing access to pornography.
Except in Cuba, which has seized laptop computers from dissidents as "subversive instruments."
In short, despite grand promises, the Internet is not yet an unrestricted electronic village green for the world. The more information that becomes available, the more governments try to stanch the flow with new filtering technologies or strict limits on who can use computers. Democracies as well as dictatorships are cracking down on sites that are found to be too dangerous, too lurid, or too controversial.
"The restrictions are coming fast and furious," said Barry Steinhardt, chairman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy group based in San Francisco, and head of the American Civil Liberties Union's task force on cyber-liberties. "The Internet is very frightening to many governments because it's an inherently democratic medium, so the first reaction is to reach out and control it."
At least 20 countries restrict access to Internet sites, from Bahrain, which bans electronic versions of Playboy magazine and home pages that the government says are pornographic, to Singapore, where the Ministry of Information and the Arts keeps out sexually explicit material and news critical of the government.
More than a dozen other countries are considering restrictions. The European Union, for example, is weighing proposals to ban child pornography and xenophobic materials. In Germany, freedom-of-speech advocates are outraged by a judge's decision in May to sentence the CompuServe official to jail (the judge suspended the sentence).
The United States, too, is trying to restrict the Internet. A 1996 law, the Communications Decency Act, criminalized on-line communcations that were "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass another person." Under that definition, independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's report to Congress on President Clinton probably would have been banned from the Net. The Supreme Court struck down the law, but another aimed at sites harmful to children is supposed to take effect next year.
A growing number of civil liberties groups - such as Global Internet Liberty Campaign, Digital Freedom Network, Internet Freedom, OpenNet, and Britain's Cyber-Rights and Cyber-Liberties - vehemently oppose restrictions on the Internet.
But many specialists argue that the issue is more complex. Shouldn't Germany have the right to restrict false and provocative Nazi propaganda? Shouldn't American states have the right to stop electronic dissemination of step-by-step instructions on assembling a car bomb? And why should any government allow child pornography to proliferate?
"In all countries, you will find people who argue that certain things should not be available to other people," said David Webster, chairman of the Transatlantic Dialogue on Broadcasting and the Information Society, a group that includes private industry and government. "No politician gets up and says: 'I think the availability of pedophilia material is concomitant to liberty.' He'll lose his seat."
The impulse to restrict access has been highlighted this month in China, where the government is holding its first trial of a "cyber-dissident." Lin Hai, a 30-year-old software engineer, is charged with inciting subversion by providing 30,000 Chinese e-mail addresses to a dissident group in Washington.
Lin, who says he is innocent, faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. Lawyers who follow China's one-sided judicial system say he is likely to be convicted.
In Shanghai, a physicist named Wang Youcai, who registered an independent political party, was sentenced to 11 years in prison. His crime: communicating with democracy activists inside and outside of China. As President Jiang Zemin cracks down on dissent, other cyber-sedition trials are likely in 1999.
Less dramatic but just as important, China's day-to-day censorship of the Internet affects scores of groups. The International Campaign for Tibet, for instance, often receives reports that the Chinese government has blocked access to its web site, said communications director Teresa Perrone. But she added that enterprising scholars in China often find ways to circumvent the censors and look at the group's information.
Several groups report that when the government blocks sites, the information still reaches Chinese via e-mail, bulletin boards, chat rooms, web sites with code words that filters cannot detect and a variety of creative ways.
"China may be the extreme case because they attempted to up a pretty impervious wall around the Internet," said Adam Clayton Powell III, vice president of the Freedom Forum, which advocates unrestricted media. "However, because China wants to be a world economic power they need real-time, financial information." Financial reports from services such as Dow Jones or Reuters often contain political news.
For every new restriction on the Net, there are new ways to get around it, said Vint Cerf, senior vice president for Internet architecture and technology at MCI-Worldcom. "It just isn't possible," to keep things away from Net viewers, he said.
But Jonathan Zittrain, executive director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School, said improved technology will make it easier to keep track of who is looking at the Net and to restrict what is seen. "China has fairly crude tools for filtering, but my prediction is the Internet of 2000 is one that China will have less difficulty in regulating," he said.
Some countries that have sampled the Internet have found it distasteful. Last year, Vietnam decided to allow the public to use Internet services. But 10 days ago, the Communist Party decided to set up a committee to consider restrictions as a way of "correcting mistakes and bias," the Liberated Saigon newspaper reported.
"The stronger the central government, the more conservative they are in terms of allowing political information on the Internet," said Grey Burkhart, a retired communications expert from the Navy reserve who helps international groups get access to technology.
Burkhart has taken a special interest in developing countries, including Russia, Bosnia, and Syria. It isn't easy. Despite the government's pledges to open Syria, the country still has no Internet service provider. To access the Internet, computer users have to make long-distance calls to Lebanon and other countries. Syrians aren't allowed to have cellular telephones, which are considered a security risk.
This year, however, Syria allowed computer modems to be installed and an Internet service is promised.
The most restrictive countries, including Iraq, North Korea and Cuba, are those that control all forms of media, not just the Internet. In Havana's airport, several laptops carried in by passengers and intended for dissident groups have been seized in the last couple of years, said Frank Calzon, executive director of the Center for a Free Cuba.
Police even took a $150 electronic typewriter from a dissident becaue it was "an instrument of high-tech subversion," Calzon said.
Surprisingly, Latin America, which has a tradition of censorship, has been quite open to the Internet. Pedro Armendariz, the director of Investigative Editors and Reporters in Mexico, a non-profit group, has traveled to conferences in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and throughout Mexico. Outside of Cuba, he has found no restrictions on the Net, other than the expense of service and unreliable telephone lines.
"I would dare to say that far from having serious restrictions in Latin America, we have a problem with sorting through so many things on the Net and discriminating about what is useful and what is garbage," Armendariz

I, and others I fear, have spent a sleepless night after hearing of the
death of Jon Postel last night. This morning there was a  note in my
mail box from Vint Cerf that said many of the things I feel at this
time. I asked him for permission to send on which he granted.
I also remember Jon. I was his primary thesis advisor along with Jerry
Estrin and I remember with fond memories the months spent closely
working with Jon while his eager mind developed the ideas in back of
what was a pioneering thesis that founded the area of protocol
verification.  Since I was at UC Irvine and Jon at UCLA we used to meet
in the morning prior to my ride to UCI at a Pancake House in Santa
Monica for breakfast and the hard work of developing a thesis. I gained
a great respect for Jon then and 10 pounds of weight.
I will miss him greatly. Jon was my second Ph.D. student. The first,
Philip Merlin, also died way before his time.

I REMEMBER IANA
Vint Cerf
A long time ago, in a network, far far away, a great adventure took
Out of the chaos of new ideas for communication, the experiments, the
tentative designs, and crucible of testing, there emerged a cornucopia
of networks. Beginning with the ARPANET, an endless stream of networks
evolved, and ultimately were interlinked to become the Internet. Someone
had to keep track of all the protocols, the identifiers, networks and
addresses and ultimately the names of all the things in the networked
universe. And someone had to keep track of all the information that
erupted with volcanic force from the intensity of the debates and
discussions and endless invention that has continued unabated for 30
years. That someone was Jonathan B. Postel, our Internet Assigned
Numbers Authority, friend, engineer, confidant, leader, icon, and now,
first of the giants to depart from our midst.
Jon, our beloved IANA, is gone. Even as I write these words I cannot
quite grasp this stark fact. We had almost lost him once before in 1991.
Surely we knew he was at risk as are we all. But he had been our rock,
the foundation on which our every web search and email was built, always
there to mediate the random dispute, to remind us when our documentation
did not do justice to its subject, to make difficult decisions with
apparent ease, and to consult when careful consideration was needed. We
will survive our loss and we will remember. He has left a monumental
legacy for all Internauts to contemplate. Steadfast service for decades,
moving when others seemed paralyzed, always finding the right course in
a complex minefield of technical and sometimes political obstacles.
Jon and I went to the same high school, Van Nuys High, in the San
Fernando Valley north of Los Angeles. But we were in different classes
and I really didnï¿½t know him then. Our real meeting came at UCLA when we
became a part of a group of graduate students working for Prof. Leonard
Kleinrock on the ARPANET project. Steve Crocker was another of the Van
Nuys crowd who was part of the team and led the development of the first
host-host protocols for the ARPANET. When Steve invented the idea of the
Request for Comments series, Jon became the instant editor. When we
needed to keep track of all the hosts and protocol identifiers, Jon
volunteered to be the Numbers Czar and later the IANA once the Internet
was in place. Jon was a founding member of the Internet Architecture Board and served
continuously from its founding to the present. He was the FIRST
individual member of the Internet Society I know, because he and Steve
Wolff raced to see who could fill out the application forms and make
payment first and Jon won. He served as a trustee of the Internet
Society. He was the custodian of the .US domain, a founder of the Los
Nettos Internet service, and, by the way, managed the networking
research division of USC Information Sciences Institute.
Jon loved the outdoors. I know he used to enjoy backpacking in the high
Sierras around Yosemite. Bearded and sandaled, Jon was our resident
hippie-patriarch at UCLA. He was a private person but fully capable of
engaging photon torpedoes and going to battle stations in a good
engineering argument. And he could be stubborn beyond all expectation.
He could have outwaited the Sphinx in a staring contest, I think.
Jon inspired loyalty and steadfast devotion among his friends and his
colleagues. For me, he personified the words ï¿½selfless service.ï¿½ For
nearly 30 years, Jon has served us all, taken little in return, indeed
sometimes receiving abuse when he should have received our deepest
appreciation. It was particularly gratifying at the last Internet
Society meeting in Geneva to see Jon receive the Silver Medal of the
International Telecommunications Union. It is an award generally
reserved for Heads of State but I can think of no one more deserving of
global recognition for his contributions. While it seems almost impossible to avoid feeling an enormous sense of
loss, as if a yawning gap in our networked universe had opened up and
swallowed our friend, I must tell you that I am comforted as I
contemplate what Jon has wrought. He leaves a legacy of edited documents
that tell our collective Internet story, including not only the
technical but also the poetic and whimsical as well. He completed the
incorporation of a successor to his service as IANA and leaves a lasting
legacy of service to the community in that role. His memory is rich and
vibrant and will not fade from our collective consciousness. ï¿½What would
Jon have done?ï¿½ we will think, as we wrestle in the days ahead with the
problems Jon kept so well tamed for so many years. There will almost surely be many memorials to Jonï¿½s monumental service
to the Internet Community. As current chairman of the Internet Society,
I pledge to establish an award in Jonï¿½s name to recognize long-standing
service to the community, the Jonathan B. Postel Service Award, which is
awarded to Jon posthumously as its first recipient.
If Jon were here, I am sure he would urge us not to mourn his passing
but to celebrate his life and his contributions. He would remind us that
there is still much work to be done and that we now have the
responsibility and the opportunity to do our part. I doubt that anyone
could possibly duplicate his record, but it stands as a measure of one
manï¿½s astonishing contribution to a community he knew and loved.

Slashdot discussion at

algorithems; or that GPG was not affected by the recent PGP hole; but other more everyday issues. How is interoperability between the two. As well as integration into common applications such as Eudora in
windows and others, possibly PINE, in LINUX. Could this be deployed such that the learning curve of transitioning users from PGP to GPG is
not too steep? I am a strong beleiver in encryption, and have used PGP for a very long
time, however I would prefer to use an OpenSource/Non-restricted program; however the usefullness of said program, as well as the security takes precidence, at least in my book." A reader writes "PGP's creator is participating in an online interview
this week. Phil is mainly interested in  clearing the air about the recently discovered ADK bug, but the larger topics of encryption and worldwide organized snoop rings (Echelon) have already come up. The interview is open to questions from anyone; runs through Friday

The meeting will start at 1pm, and will be followed by dinner afterwards.
Agenda: The primary agenda is discussion of the work people are doing,
projects, things you're playing with, current events in crypto and privacy.
If you'd like to give a talk, please contact Bill or DDT.
We're still confirming the location, but it will either be at Moscone Center,
where the conference is being held, or within two blocks, at AT&T 795 Folsom St.,
or at the Thirsty Bear Tavern on Howard.  All of these are 5-10 minutes walk
from Caltrain and BART.
A follow-on announcement will give the definite location.
