@_subject: Meetings and PGP 6.0 
Now that Network General and Network Associates (McAfee) have merged
(business wise aswell as buildings), I was wondering where the CypherPunks
meetings are going to be at the old netgen building or the new (BIG)
Network Associates (netass.com) building?  And is it still gonna be at 12
on the second saturday of the month? (seeing as this saturday(first) is
the NAI company picnic).
And, has anyone here played with PGP 6.0 (still in developement).  I hope
they do more changes in the final, Photo ID's and the misc other changes.
Thanks, Billy
