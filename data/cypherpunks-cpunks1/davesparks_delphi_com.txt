That one's sort of your "trademark", isn't it?   (TRAN is really
clever, BTW.)  One scheme that seems to make even more sense, though, is:
         des | tran | IDEA | tran | des
You get the benefits of 112 bits worth of DES keyspace along with 128 bits
of IDEA keyspace, and thus don't stake your total security on the strength
of EITHER algorithm.  Other than making the code bulkier by requiring the
inclusion of code for TWO crypto algorithms, and 64 bits of extra key
material, what other drawbacks would there be to such a scheme (in a
NON-commercial setting where licensing of the patented IDEA is not an
issue)?  If IDEA turns out to not be as secure as we've been led to believe,
at least it, sandwiched between two layers of TRAN shuffling, should at least
slow down a meet-in-the-middle attack on the remaining two layers of DES.
As I recall, last time we discussed this over on sci.crypt you also
advocated an additional step of "PRNGXOR".  Is that still the case?  Have
you had the opportunity to read the Eurocrypt '94 paper by Eli Biham on
triple DES modes, yet?

If IDEA can be *TRIVIALLY* broken, and assuming the availability of the
massive amounts of memory needed to store all of the data required for a
MITM attack, then you're technically correct. But, even granting that
possibility for the time being, you still have the equivalent of 57 bits of
DES keyspace, which is better than totally relying on 3DEA.
While a "super DES breaker" machine has been hypothesized, and a cost to
build it estimated, I don't recall anyone doing so for a "MITM DES breaker"
which would require incredible amounts of memory. At a minimum, it would
require not only *TWO* super-DES-crackers, but a very sophistocated machine
to gather the blocks generated by all of the various parallel processors
comprising the other two machines, store, and continually compare them,
searching for matches.
IMHO, that "middle" machine would be far more complex and expensive than the
other two. A MITM attack might, theoretically, take only twice as long as
attacking a single layer, the cost of doing so would be much more than twice
as large.  Anyone care to estimate what the cost of the RAM alone for the
"MITM interface" machine would be?  Let's see, for two 56 bit beys, you'd
need storage for 2^57 blocks of 8 bytes each, or 2^60 bytes.  At $40 per Mb,
or so, that would come to ... let's see ... $4 * 10^51 for memory alone.  And
once the list of blocks started growing as the attack progressed, could the
interface processor keep up with the other two, in real time?  Massively
parallel processors might speed both ends of the attack, but the "database
comparison phase" would be the real bottleneck, IMHO.

[11 iterations deleted]
There's always a trade-off, and you've just demonstrated one of the
extremes.  In the final analysis, it's sort of like deciding whether to
spend $1000 on a security system to protect a $500 car, for "security", or
leave the doors unlocked and "hide" the ignition key under the mat for "ease
of use".  Probably something in between makes the most sense.
HOWEVER ... I was merely demonstrating one possible permutation on the
triple DES method. (More precisely, a permutation to someone else's
permutation.)  Replacing the middle layer of DES with IDEA seems to be a
feasible alternative, since IDEA is as fast as DES, or slightly faster. If a
user is concerned enough about security to want to use 3DES in the first
place, then an extra 64 bits of keying material is not an unreasonable
burden.  It also "diversifies" the overall protection in case either DES or
IDEA should eventually be found to be exceptionally weak when attacked in a
certain, previously unknown, manner.
IMHO, "paranoid" would be saying that people *MUST* protect their data to
this level, regardless of its actual "value", as opposed to merely
presenting options for an end-user the choose from, including some
common-sense key management guidelines as well.
A single iteration of the 512 layer "overkill" scenario might even make
sense, actually, under certain extraordinary circumstances.  Unless the
various algorithms react in some sort of strange way to actually *WEAKEN*
each other, your final security is equal to that of the STRONGEST of the
mix.  OTOH, if we *KNEW* that the best attack against IDEA was brute force,
then single IDEA would suffice for just about any conceivable application.
What would you like to suggest in the way of key management to make that
"link" at least as strong as the algorithmic one?  Your point is certainly a
valuable one, but the two aren't mutually exclusive.  That would be like
saying that I won't buy a lock for my front door until I've first replaced
all my windows with something more sturdy than glass.  It depends on the
nature and source of any potential attacks.  To follow the analogy, some
"burglars" are better at lock picking than glass-smashing.

Perhaps not, but I would not call a person who decides to do so, for reasons
of his own, "rabid, clinically paranoid" - a phrase you used in your
original post. While I might chuckle at his inconsistent approach, I wouldn't
call the men in white coats to take him away.  In fact, I DON'T KNOW whether
his approach is "reasonable" or not until I have a chance to evaluate the
perceived threat he's protecting against.  If the potential burglar he's
concerned about is an expert lockpicker who has a phobia about breaking
glass, then your hypothetical "vault door" *MIGHT* make sense, to continue
the analogy. The point being, I'm not in a position to make that decision
for him.
Technically, it might be easier to use the third degree on someone rather
than attempt to break even a 384 bit public key, but sheer level of effort is
not always the whole story.  Let's say I stumbled across an encrypted
message from someone I knew, not addressed to me, that I thought might be
"interesting" to decipher.  I *MIGHT*, hypothetically, be willing to write a
program that would run in the background on my PC, even if it took many,
many years, or even decades, to arrive at a solution by brute force.
Breaking into the guy's house, or torturing his passphrase out of him might
be "faster", or "easier" for me, but that's not the nature of the "threat"
I'd pose, since I, as an "attacker" would also be weighing risks versus
rewards.  While I might be willing to wait years or even decades to satisfy
my curiosity, the message is probably not valuable enough to risk a prison
term for.  Thus, a longer key, more layers of encryption, etc. might make
more sense (for him against me) than buying an expensive safe to store his
keyring in, or splitting it up as a "shared secret" so that a "rubber hose"
attack on any one person would not reveal the entire key/passphrase.
Also, the envelope of encryption protection needs to be "pushed".  As
processing becomes faster and cheaper, currently "secure" technologies could
become vulnerable.  What seems "clinically paranoid" today might seem
"reasonable" in a decade or two, who knows?  Why not get them tested and
proven BEFORE they're absolutely needed, even if that testing is at the
hands of people willing to risk being considered "paranoid"?

@_subject: Double DES calculations 
"Only" $500 Billion, huh (for tapes and drives alone)?  Let's see how the
logistics work out on that.  If each tape drive measured 2"X4"X6", and if
they were mounted in racks, back-to-back, five feet high, with three feet
wide aisleways between them, they would require 3.2 million square feet of
floor space.  (How big is the entire Pentagon, BTW?)  Assuming each of the
300 million tape drives consumed 25 watts of power, the total power
consumption would be 7500 megawatts!  At $0.10 per kwh., it would cost $1
million/hour in power costs alone, assuming a 33% overhead for removing all
they heat they generated.
Assuming it took an average of five seconds to load a tape into a drive,
loading 300 million tapes would take 16,680 man hours, or roughly 10
man-years assuming a normal 40 hr./week work schedule.  A set of replacement
tapes alone would cost $3 Billion.
It has been estimated that breaking single-DES would take 1.35 hours on a
hypothetical "super-DES-breaker" machine, searching half the total keyspace,
with a 50% probability of finding the key in that time.  You yield the same
probability on double-DES would require searching 71% of the keyspace, which
would take roughly two hours, using TWO such machines.  During that two
hours, each of the 300 million tapes would be filled with data, but no
actual MITM comparisons would have occurred yet.  Thus far, we've spent $2
million on electricity alone.
Now let's assume that each block of data generated was at least pre-sorted
onto one of the 150 million available drives during the initial phase,
according to its MSBs, or whatever.  Now it remains to check for matches for
the data on each of the 150 million drives on the ENcryption side with the
corresponding drive on the DEcryption side.  Let's further assume 150
million processors each assigned to handle a pair of drives, one on each
side.  Assume that a complete pass through the tape would require the same
two hours as it took to write the data there in the first place, with
buffered I/O so that at least half of the drives are running at full speed,
and ignoring any rewind time between passes.
Assuming a fast enough processor, the number of passes required would vary
according to the ratio of the total data on each tape, divided by the total
RAM, with the available RAM available for searching equalling four times the
search block size to allow double buffering on both sides.  With that in
mind, the number of passes required would equal to ( 4 * 4 Gb / RAM ).  If
64 Mb of RAM is available per processor, then a total of 256 passes would be
required, for a total search time of 512 hours.  The sum total of all the
RAM on all 150 million processors would be 2 * 10^16 bytes.  At $40/Mb, the
RAM alone would cost $800 Billion, bringing the total cost of this machine
to $1.3 TRILLION!  The time required to crack a double-DES key is over 200
times that of a single-DES key, at a cost in excess of half a BILLION
dollars per 112 bit key.
While that *MIGHT* be technologically feasible, it probably wouldn't be
politically feasible.  That is probably more than the sum total of all US
defense spending in out 120 year history, and probably more than "Star Wars"
was projected to cost.  That'd be a bit hard to hide in a "black" budget.
Of course, there are various ways of trading dollars for time in designing
such a system.  Speed is virtually proportional to cost.
Nevertheless ... if you've got the time to do TRIPLE-DES, it's probably
still wise, "Justin Case"...

The thread was concerning the vulnerability of Double-DES with an
intermediate layer of IDEA in the middle.  It was proposed that if IDEA
could ultimately be TRIVIALLy cracked, then DES-IDEA-DES was no stronger
than Double-DES.  At that point I did some "back of the envelope"
calculations on the cost of breaking Double-DES using a MITM attack.
I'm not sure how "cycles" fit into DES.  The brute-force technique I was
hypothesizing involved trying all possible keys on the encrypt and decrypt
sides, storing them the resultant 64 bit blocks (all 2^60 bytes of them),
then comparing them.  How would Pollard rho speed that up?

Agreed, Hal.  I was just pointing out the fallacy of saying that 2-DES
would only take *TWICE* as long to break as 1-DES.  While there are some
tradeoffs that trade space for time, the one virtually constant factor is
monetary cost. Whether it's 300 million drives running for 10+ days to crack
the key, or 10 million for a year or so, the total energy consumed will be
virtually the same. By my calculations, the energy costs alone would be over
half a billion dollars per key.  Not only that, but one of these
hypothetical $1.5 TRILLION "monster crackers" can still only break 30 keys a
year.  (Good reason to generate temporary session keys!)
Also, I neglected the "overhead" costs associated, such as periodic
maintenance on all those drives.  Drives in nearly constant use will need
frequent maintenance, especially head cleaning, which is not a trivial task
on 300 million drives.
The only way I can see that this would be cost-effective is to locate it
near a prison (for cheap convict labor) with a cheap power source nearby.
That, or invent a cheaper storage medium than DAT.
In the final analysis, though, you're right.  I'd hate to calculate the cost
to break 3-DES.  Unless you're encrypting a high speed data link in real
time, where utmost throughput is essential, I see no reason to not use that,
or something equally strong.
