I know that removing the battery in a PS/2 "disengages" the password.
But can it be disengaged if a person has an administration-type of diagnostic/setup/boot-up floppy?

I have my crummy IBM PS/2 passwd protected upon turning it on.
I know that removing the battery in a PS/2 deletes the password.
But can it be bypassed by an MIS-type if that person has an administration-type of diagnostic/setup/boot-up floppy?

I understand how that works, but how did the admin-dude bypass my passwd (a combo of six letters/numbers only known to me)?  My log file says that he only made one attempt at getting in.
Can CMOS store my passwd AND perhaps an admin passwd established in CMOS before I received the crummy PS/2?  Is it encrypted?  Do CMOSes in general encrypt their passwds ==> can code be added where the passwd is stored?  How much space is in the "memory" of CMOS?
Thanks for all the replies...
