But my dear Vangelis, that's exactly what Bill is talking about.

There is the flaw in this logic.  If you do find a pattern, then this
means that the algorithm is *BROKEN*.

@_subject: AOL /  CyberPromo email blocking 
This was in the Daily Brief on 11/05:
* A federal Judge ruled yesterday that America Online can block
  junk e-mail from Cyber Promotions Inc.
    - said neither the First Amendment nor the constitutions of
      Pennsylvania or Virginia allow Cyber to send unsolicited
      computer ads to AOL members.
Does anybody know where I can find a full article on this?  It sounds like
it might set some precedent for other cases dealing with the Internet.

@_subject: /dev/random and similar 
There was a thread here a while back about /dev/random and similar devices
for Linux, but I managed to lose the mails and the hks.net archives still
aren't working (any news on that?).  If someone could tell me where I
could find such a driver, I would appreciate it very much.      TIA!

Do you seriously believe that a terrorist who wishes to take an explosive
device on board a plane fears the security of an airport? It's not
possible to put such a thought into anyone but a prole; we are not proles,
and they are not proles. The real effect and intent is obvious.

Oh, so you're just going to fix up your program a little bit, and
immediately your private key system will turn into a public key system?
Are you sure you read A.C. and didn't just look at the pictures?
I'm beginning to see this  as being a
variation on XOR.
The amazing shrinking key... pretty soon we'll have 1 bit keys, and
they'll have to be registered with this company for ITAR compliance. ;)
Says who?  You?  Hahahahahaha.
So a cryptosystem that's been in existence for an entire eleven days (you
said it was created January 1, 1997) has had "sufficient" "analytical research invested"?  My, you ARE clueless.
You're right, they didn't.  It's because they published code first and
then asked for review.  They didn't try to make a profit on an operating
system-specific piece of pre-compiled code before explaining the system
and giving full details.
Then why are you still posting?
You mean you're changing XOR to AND?
SUB encrypt1 'Super secret encryption routine
SHARED text_to_encrypt$
text_to_encrypt$ = "[SECRET]" + text_to_encrypt$ + "[SECRET]"
END SUB
(Will you sue me for copyright infringement now?  I bet it looks identical
to your code -- and in the same language, too.)

Of course, one could always follow the ID4 example and triangulate cells
from a single location, preferably using equipment that any small-time
operator can find in his own car.
