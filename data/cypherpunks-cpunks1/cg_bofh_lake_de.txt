@_subject: Scientology and police visit XS4ALL Amsterdam 
Probably. Amsterdam isn't exactly the wild west, and they didn't take the
computer equipment with them, they just inventoried everything so to have
something to sell when their claims prove valid. Which I doubt (shit, I
will be moving to this country in a couple of weeks...)
I don't know whether this is valid. I assume so. I also think it is about
time we develop some ideas about anonymous web publishing. Probably some
chained cgi scripts could do, but how to get around traffic analysis?
