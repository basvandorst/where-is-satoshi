I don't know if this was an isolated incident, but I recently attempted to
pick up a package at the Post Office using my passport as I.D.  NO, I was
told, this is not acceptable identification, and as a union worker, you
can't tell me what to do.  Appeals to chicken-hearted management were
brushed off; I finally identified the highest ranking union official (shop

@_subject: Ebonite Notes from All Over 
1. J. Jackson apparently now finds "ebonics" to be a "Goot Thang"(SM): _S.F.
Examiner_ reporter Venise (sic) Wagner headlines in the paper's Web site
today that "Jackson backs Oakland 'ebonics.' Rights leader switches position
after hearing about program in detail." Says Jackson: "The first message the
came out was that the district was going to make black language equitable
(sic) as another language.  That is not the idea." Is Mr. Jackson speaking
in Ebonics?
2. From "A Brief History of Plastics": "Ebonite (TM) is produced by heating
natural rubber with about 10% by weight of sulpher.  This is about five time
more sulpher than would be used in conventional vulcanisation. The material
is hard, black and tough and bears a striking resemblance to the hardwood,
ebony--hence its name. The main use for ebonite in the early 1800s was in
piano keys."
3. Although Ebonite International sponsors the Professional Bowling
Association's "Ebonite Classic" tournament, the Official ABC/WIBC Ruling on
Ball Cleaners, as at 9/12/96, has ruled that their 1-and-2-Step Reactive
Resin Ball Cleaners "cannot be used during ABC/WIBC sanctioned competition
because it would be in violation of Rule 19." But take heart: the American
Bowling Conference Equipment Specifications Department has decided that
"these products are allowed before or after league and/or tournament sessions."
4. What's the difference between a bowling ball and a black woman?  If
you're really, really hungry, you can always eat the bowling ball.
N.B. I personally find  above to be racist, sick, and not very "funny" at all.

of communication, the 1st Am has typically been tossed out of the window.
Recall the "seven dirty words" brouhaha.  Perhaps they've lightened up.  I can imagine Herr Hundt and his FCC fellows
looking on fondly and indulgently as cute-as-a-button sitcom kids inform
their network TV show parents more frequently than we've heard "fuckhead" on

I seem to recall somewhere in the dim dark past that the expression "you
suck" would have been subsumed under the "fighting words" statutes,
implying, as it does, that the object of the utterer's scorn was either
homosexual or a woman who casually performed fellation.
If the FCC approves of "you suck" on network television, perhaps there is
yet hope that the perverse topics daily discussed on c-punks would, at least
temporarily, be allowed.

My dear fellow:
I suppose you missed the notion that, on the Internet, *some* folks know
that you are a dog.
P.S. You, Dimi, D. Thorn, Dimi, "Nurdane Oskas", Dimi, "Awaken to Me",
Dimi,"World's Youngest Cypherpunk", Dimi, "Andre the Cypherpunk", Dimi, etc.
etc. are to be commended if not appreciated for your efforts in ruining an
amazingly good thing.  See you in alt.baloney.  Incidentally, do you
habitually defecate (FYI, that's "to discharge feces from the bowels") in
your own single-wide? (Son, that's a rhetorical question.)
The very fact that you shamelessly and boneheadedly refuse to keep your head
down after all of the damage that you and your lot have caused (with 1K+
lurkers "looking on") is worthy, certainly, of some serious consideration.
Ia! Ia! Cthulhu Fhtagn!

My guess is that you and your companion would have been further discommoded,
with the possible concomitant saving of your lives.

I am woman, hear me roar
in numbers too big to ignore
As R. J. Wagner once said, "Koo koo, baby."
Hey, I hope that the above is construed as neither a flame nor as "off topic".
May I additionally congratulate Nurdane on her birthday?
Yo "Phill"! When's your cyber-revolutionary birthday? Maybe we can all chip
in to buy you a biscuit. (See, in England, they say, "That certainly takes
the biscuit". Eh, "Phill"?) BTW, "Phill", did you want to make good on your
bet to Sandy at this time?
Ain't C-punks fun nowadays?

Wrong! White-americans play a very important and useful role in the new
multi-cultural society. Sheesh! _Someone's_ got to work, support their
families, pay taxes, and obey the law. Hee hee! Him so stoopit!
