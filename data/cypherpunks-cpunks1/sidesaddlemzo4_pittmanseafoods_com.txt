where you can get great steak and shrimp
soft and long lacy scarf light enough for spring, extra long for winter wrapping, elegant enough for church, cute enough for a tshirt...i really love this scarf pattern (gee can you tell?). (i hate in quilting and knitting and sewing when the designs get all fancy just because they can). when you need to be home, may you find your way.
i found that amazing old shirt (we're big fans) at the thrift store for $1 and it's so soft. my happy plans for this evening include knitting and watching two favorite movies: far and away followed by tristan and isolde.
but so worth it.
i love her style. 4. i don't worry about a little "creative clutter" in cate's room. i say, a good dress up/ barbie mess day better than watching tv all afternoon, right? pretty soon i will just put my 'kerchief on again and go to town. (yes, that is what cate's room looks like again, just over a month after the big clean. i tell you, i'm fighting a losing battle with that girl). does that answer your question, mary? i hope it helps! wink.
cate was so happy she began yelling "let's give a hand to springtime! the ms craft dept was featured in an article, and their personal crafting projects were shown. we ate corned beef and cabbage with irish soda bread last night in preparation for the day of the irish. i mean, look at her hair. let's give a hand to the world, for everything it can do!! doesn't she look like lucy from chronicles of narnia? i made this one for a gift, but i've already cast on another for moi. wooohoooo!" i am trying to be a patient, kind mom.
time for a new spring look...
1. in the craft room i throw everything on the homework table. that clears up the floor for more mess craft making.
