[text elided for brevity]
So, just how is this to be taken?  I don't understand, Curtis.  Do you know
something about Kennedy's position on issues of information privacy that you'd
like to expand on here?  Kennedy's comment seems more of an inconsequential
offhand remark.

[text elided for brevity]
[Apologies for not adding much more text in a reply than that in the original
   text.]
Jim has brought up a very interesting subject, which isn't discussed enough in
most of the places I look for such discussion: data inferencing.
A one-shot anonymous ID, besides having the certain immediately obvious
advantages - useful for preserving user anonymity, trouble in the event of
State seizure of the remailer, and lower sysadmin accounting load - makes
traffic analysis a somewhat more difficult affair.
Of course, one-shot anonymous user handles are of little use to the detweilers
of the net, who seem to return to the same places, again and again.  It doesn't
take much acuity to notice things like the use of, oh, say, TeX-format quote
marks in body text, as mentioned in a previous post by Tim May.
I shall, of course, refrain from using smilies to indicate humor.  I dislike
them, and would never use such an unsubtle mechanism to convey wry amusement.
 I prefer textual encoding.  Text is rich.

Who is Sgt Russell?  The person who started this thread (Wayne Q Jones) should
read his messages more carefully.  I believe he saw my response to Sgt.
Harlow's information request and didn't read it carefully: I work for Silicon
Graphics, not the USMC.
[text elided]
Sgt. Harlow,
Wayne Jones speaks only for himself.  I speak only for myself.  Your .sig line
declares that you know you only speak for yourself, too, and I find that
declaration admirable.
You are certainly welcome to participate in the discussions here.  Bear in mind
that there _are_ a range of political opinions here, ranging from radical
libertarian (me and quite a few others) to various flavors of political
authoritarian (a minor subset, I think).
I suspect - I do not know the fellow - that Mr. Jones is undergoing short
spasms of Poor Impulse Control, his being an immediate anti-authoritarian
reaction that isn't taking into account that you are an individual acting on
your own initiative.
To put it gently, I'm not fond of authoritarian organizations... especially
government ones.  However, I'm ex-military, myself, and this might be what
helps me moderate my approach to particular people.
You will find that issues of encryption and data protection are enormously
_political_ issues.  That is, their application profoundly alters what it means
to live amonst other people.  You may be somewhat - understandably - puzzled at
the reactions of certain people on the list, and wonder what all the fuss is
about.  Please don't be put off further enquiry!  You should consider, if you
haven't already done it, reading some of the excellent cypherpunks political
pieces by list participants such as Timothy May, Duncan Frissell, Sandy
Sandfort and others.  You might also take at Chuck Hammill's "From Crossbows to
Even if you don't agree with the views expressed therein, I would lay money on
the bet that you will know far more about the broader issues of cryptography
and data security than will your nominal superiors.
You have my agreement on this.
Your motivations seem clear enough to me.  Dig in!  Enjoy yourself here, and I
look forward to your participation.
I'm sure I'm not the only list participant who would go further, and elicit
your _active_ participation.  It would be a treat to know, from a solid source
such as yourself, how routine security issues are handled in an operational
military environment.
Thanks for your time,

Noon 25 July 1994
Prepended disclaimer: I do not speak for Netcom or SGI.
I have spoken to Bryant at Netcom's operations center in San Jose,
California, and he has asked me to pass along the following to the
Cypherpunks list and anyone else concerned with L. Detweiler and system
user accounts:
Both of these accounts have been suspended.  The "nym" account was
suspended as of late last week.
Although it is not Netcom's policy to give out account user information
which includes names, addresses, and other such personal data, Bryant was
at liberty to say that the user accounts "tmp" and "nym" were the same
person.  I approve of this company policy, by the way.
The accounts department at Netcom has been made aware by Bryant that
trouble has been generated by the singular person writing checks in
payment of both the "nym" and "tmp" accounts, and has been told not to accept
any new orders from anyone suspected to be the same person.  Particular
attention is being paid to orders made from the Denver area.
Bryant has asked me to add that Netcom's way of handling such trouble
is strictly complaint-driven.  If you have a complaint about a particular
user, your best bet is to call Netcom.  Bryant can be reached directly at
Netcom by calling 408-983-1510.

This access method uses httpd, which listens at a different port (tcp 80) on
the server than ftpd.  What this *means* is that ftp is not likely to work with
this address.  Depending upon the local setup, you may/may not be able to ftp
into this site, by way of a different site mapping, and be able to root around
for the file.
However, bear in mind (you need to hack html to grok this issue) that the above
pathname is often relative, rather than absolute.  That is, the httpd daemon
knows where to look to serve you, but may hide the absolute pathname from you,
which may really be something like:
... which may itself be symlinked elsewhere.
The upshot of this is that you need to get a web browser, like Lynx (sp? I
don't use it; line mode) or xmosaic (which I use and get along with).
Hope this starts to help.

A judge admonished the police in Radnor, Pa., for pretending a Xerox
copy machine was a lie detector. Officials had placed a metal
colander on the head of a suspect and attached the colander to the
copier with metal wires. In the copy machine was a typewritten
message: "He's lying."
Each time investigators received answers they didn't like, they pushed
the copy button and out popped the message, "He's lying." Apparently

                         Nelson Bolyard
Everyone is talking about the Clipper Chip, and lots of people are
wondering about the FBI's digital telephony initiative.  This talk
will discuss both of those things and provide some historical
perspective on the battle between Congress and the Administration
over control of standards for civilian cryptography, and CPSR's
role in that debate.
Nelson Bolyard is an engineer for a major computer manufacturer in
the Silicon Valley.  He has background in cryptography and highly
secure systems, and is presently working in high-speed networking.

@_subject: More Gilder pointers 
There's also a good interview in May '94 *Upside* with Gilder.  "Upside" bills
itself as "The Business Magazine for the Technology Elite", and is not a bad
deal even for the $4.95 cover price (its primary competitor seems to be the
$14.95 *Red Herring*, another technology-sector business magazine aimed at
I'm reading his 1989 bestseller "Microcosm": pick it up if you can find it.
It's excellent.  Gilder is a rare economist.  He doesn't simply put forth solid
free market arguments.  He doesn't simply jump on the technology bandwagon.  He
knows science, and tells a whopping good story.  For instance: I hadn't known
that Andrew Grove (Intel CEO) was Hungarian, and had escaped Communist rule by
crawling through the mud into Austria.  America is full of incredible success
"Fibersphere" is his latest, in which he makes his controversial "death of
television" and "dark fiber" arguments.  I've only read excerpts in other
Forbes articles, but it looks worth picking up.

There was a long article in April 11, 1994 Forbes: "AUCTIONING THE
AIRWAYS", by George Gilder". It had a supprising amount of technical
information about a new technology similar to spread spectrum. The article
has a "too cheep to meter" flavor that I do not agree with but it does
present some interesting information and ideas.
It is about 43k bytes and is available via anonymous ftp at

@_subject: My skepticism/promises WAS Re: Mien Beinkpff 
This last subtask is very important.  I remember seeing the first set of
errata, and hearing reports of Bruce's (understandable) dismay at the
publisher's cavalier treatment of the typography of mathematical formulae.
I've only recently gotten a round tuit myself, having perused the first section
of a housemate's copy, and am convinced I need my own. I'll have my own Friday
afternoon (Stacey's sells it locally), and am wondering if the most recent set
of errata are still available from Bruce.  I was on a distribution from Bruce
for these, and am wondering if the mailing list still exists.
Avoiding academic connections will provide some ammunition when someone tries
to drag you into the usual tired "acceptable use" arguments.
Netcom?  Only if you're a masochist.  If you try dialing in, that is.  Or doing
anything involving finger daemons.  Or...
Um, your own "Netcom company"?  Netcom is certainly not the best business model
for an Internet service provider.  Look at the load problems!  Their pricing
model is very, very poor.  You get what you pay for.  I have 2 accounts on
Netcom (one business, one personal).  Dialing into Netcom is useless, so all my
mail to those accounts is .forward'd to elsewhere.
If you're seriously contemplating a Netcom-like service, ignore the whiners
("But your service costs too much!") and implement a rational pricing model,
rather than an all-you-can-eat-for-one-low-price dialup policy.
I don't know who you are, but it certainly makes it very difficult for anyone
to give you the benefit of the doubt when you publicly admit such a cavalier
attitude toward your own finances.  Read what you've written above, and ask
yourself if it inspires confidence.
You say, "Fuck 'em... I'm going to do it anyway..."  Well, OK.  But talk like
that, while a fine display of your Cajones, doesn't inspire me.  Good luck to
you, though.  I'm looking forward to your solution to the duplicate spending
problem.  That one alone would take a bit of work...
I, too, value Tim's postings.  At the Extro-1 conference this last weekend, in
a discussion on "The Extropians Virtual Community", it was noted (not a new
point) that good posts never draw the responses that objectionable posts do.
 Herein lie very large and serious issues of incentive engineering, which will
not be solved anytime soon.
[referring to Tim's discussion of "things we can't buy with tokens":]
If you want this - or anything (desirability aside) - you're going to have to
*convince* the rest of us - part of your potential market - why we should want
it too.
Who are you?  Seriously.  Do you have a reputation?  With whom?  Is this
reputation salable?
You don't know, yet you make a solicitation of funds?  Oh, yes: different rules
*do* apply to banks.  You really do need to read into North American banking
Do the authorities know where you sleep?  This "virtual entity" is *you*.  Are
you judgement proof?  "Virtual" is such a fashionable buzzword these days.
 What do you mean by it?
Well, I guess I've answered at least part of my own question... they *do* know
where you sleep.
That's Yanques to you, bub.
Have fun trying.  Do you mean "cost to credit company" or "cost to end user"?
The playing field seems to have shifted ...
Just *which* business do you plan to focus on?  Which one is the one you are
chartered as a corporate entity to pursue?  If I were a potential investor, I
wouldn't put my money onto a raft of promises.
I'm not trying to squelch your enthusiasm, but it's damned difficult for a
smart and energetic polymath (you sound like one; many of us are) to viscerally
accept the necessity of narrow specification and ruthless pursuit of a single
goal.  You need to do one thing very well, and see if it flies.  Otherwise, you
will accrete a reputation as a dabbler.
Royalties which will buy me how much petrol?  How many pairs of trousers?  How
many copies of the *Economist* or *Playboy*?  How many scoops of Baskin
It has to be cash with backing.  Calling it something cool doesn't convince.
 There need to be fundamentals in place.
You've said this a number of times.  Are you simply expressing your belief that
you'll never really do anything?  Then why post at all?  Do you have that low
an opinion of your own abilities?  Do something.  Don't complain.  Your life is
your own.  I will be impressed when you *do* something.
You make some interesting assumptions here.  Why?  Why should all of the people
you list above do these things?
Are you willing to pay Perry large amounts of money for consulting?  He *might*
consider it, if it's cash up front. (Right, Perry?)
I suggest you simply dive in and start learning basic economics.  Start with
Hazlitt's *Economics in One Lesson*, Bastiat's *Economic Sophisms*, anything by
Hayek, Mises, and David (the younger) Friedman, for starters.  Don't expect
someone like Perry to open up to you with "revealed knowledge" which will make
it all clear for you.  If you're as serious about your Homework as you keep
repeating, learn the fundamentals of how the world works.
You will then have at least some of the tools to acquire more tools.
One of Tim's many graces is that he rarely makes a practice of the line-by-line
response.  I wish I could say the same of myself.

To cut short the obvious replies, I'd already checked all the pending sendmail

Thought you might like to know, if you don't already know, that the Guardian
has started to produce a new weekly supplement called The Guardian OnLine,
which is "exclusively devoted to the startling developments in computing,
science and technology." The first edition (Thursday May 19) had a lot about
the Internet and the recent crackdown on the Fidonet system by Italian police.
Might be worth sending them items about cypherpunks etc.

This was forwarded to me by a friend in the UK.  I don't know whether this guy

It's not anonymous, but uses crypto.  It's good to see more attention being
paid to commerce mechanisms on the net.

I had a similar thing happen to: Detweiler sent me private email some months
back, in some apparent urgency, asking my opinion on "pseudospoofing", as "a
director of the Extropy Institute".  I replied that I wasn't in the business -
as an ExI director or otherwise - of having an opinion on everything.
This seemed to really bother him.  He emailed me back, expressing his surprise
that I didn't drop everything and respond to his clarion call.  I'm told -
though I didn't find out until a few days ago - that I too ended up being
listed as a "tentacle".  How amusing.
Or a serious local loopback problem.

I see several articles on digicash, and a general bibliography.  I suspect
(from a combination of private email, the postings here, and a little testing I
did) that Harry B.'s problems had at least one foot in the fact that he was
using a version of a line-mode browser which sometimes maps temporary links
differently for different clients (e.g. Cello vs xmosaic vs whatever).
