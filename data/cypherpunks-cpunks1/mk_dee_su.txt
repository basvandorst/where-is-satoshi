Are you equating passive attacks with active attacks? If I understand
how CryptoCat works correctly, it is resistant against passive
interception attacks, whereas Google Chat stores cleartext on Google
servers, which are easily accessible to law enforcement. Active
attacks against SSL can be mitigated by pinning CryptoCat
certificates, so you are left with what, compromise of server
infrastructure? That requires LE jurisdiction where the servers are
located, domain expertise, and dealing with the risk that the
compromise is detected. All that vs. Google servers, which, if I
remember right, provide a friendly interface to user accounts once
served with a simple wiretapping order (and as has been already
mentioned, Google is a multinational corporation, subject to a
multitude of jurisdictions, and is known to bend over for whoever is
in charge).

I doubt that the Tor Project will ever acknowledge such support. Tor
developers (or at least policy people) like to pretend that Tor is
used for purposes that they consider morally right, and ignore the
uses that are morally wrong [1]. I believe it's an american thing b
one typical tell-tale sign is treating criminals as some masterminds
who can already easily achieve what they want [2] (americans are used
to doing the same in gun control debates), and ignoring the fact that
the project facilitates anonymity for criminals just as well, if not
more, as for non-criminals. Personally, I don't understand what's the
big deal about the make-believe game, and it probably detracts from
the project's credibility, but it's fun to watch nevertheless.
I actually intend to write a Tor server patch to be able to gather
.onion access statistics on relays, once I am sufficiently bored, just
for the fun cognitive dissonance potential (expecting drugs and CP
forums to top the list).

Hello gentlemen,
Here and there I see references to bglobalb or bstate-levelb powerful
adversaries when it comes to end-to-end traffic correlation b i.e.,
it's supposed to be very hard. Because Tor network has many nodes,
there are guard nodes, there is research, blog posts, CIA funding
(well, not anymore, but similar funding from EU is in the works),
useless bureaucracy, college kids playing in serious development, yada
yada b you know the drill.
Anyway, let's do some math. Below, you will find a table where left
column denotes the number of Guard+Exit+Fast+Stable Tor relays one
needs to sniff at Class-C level, and right column denotes the
probability that a given circuit will go through both intercepted
entry and exit nodes. This is slightly imprecise, because same node
can't be both entry and exit for a circuit, and there are other
ignored intricacies (e.g., port policies) that push the estimates in
the other direction b the reason is that I am better with writing
quick scripts [1] than with Excel. The consensus taken for analysis is
from a few hours ago, and I read Tor server code from current stable
version in Gentoo (0.2.2.35) b this probably doesn't matter.
10 11.50%
11 14.56%
12 16.52%
13 16.80%
14 17.69%

16 18.90%
17 19.20%
18 19.50%
19 20.46%

26 24.48%
27 24.82%
28 25.55%
29 25.90%
30 25.90%
As you can see, sniffing just 25 Class-C networks (or 42 individual
nodes) lets an adversary correlate ~25% of (non-.onion) circuits.
Which networks are these?

All of these servers are in US/CA or EU jurisdiction, so even an
unsophisticated LE operation can issue ~20 wiretapping orders at ISP
level (many of these networks are operated by same hosting providers),
and immediately deanonymize ~25% of Tor traffic. So far for anonymity!
Oh, and if you are just into looking what sites Tor users visit, the
situation is even better b intercepting the same 25 Class-C networks
will let you see 72% of the traffic. Picking better non-Guard Exits
will improve this figure to 78%. That's right b 4/5th of Tor traffic
exits through just 25 LANs.

Bingo b in the first graph in the ticket [1] you see that the
probability gets to ~80% when the number of nodes gets to 40. What
this graph doesn't show, however, is that many of these nodes are
attached to the same switch, or even run on same machine in different
VMs, or on different IPs (some even run on same IP). After accounting
for that, the number of tiny networks (at least /28, from going over
the list in the original message) and nodes one needs to intercept in
order to get the same 80% figure gets down to ~25. And of course, if
one is smarter about choosing which nodes to intercept, the
probability of seeing both entry and exit traffic is also significant:
~25%. It is also possible to do something in between (choose some
Guard-only and Exit-only nodes), but my laziness kicked in at that
point of analysis.
Here are the network again, in case anyone has the resources and is
curious enough about who does what with Tor:

Manually, using WHOIS and traceroute. This can be done automatically
using GeoIP, but I wanted to be sure in the results (also visited some
hosting sites), and writing a proper program would deviate too much
from the initially intended bquick hackb design.
That's why I insist that everyone should be a relay by default, even
if there are some theoretical issues that weren't worked out yet [1].
Making everyone a relay also results in a healthier users community (I
think I2P is one), and more intrinsic network growth.

and later confirmed [11,12], to be vulnerable to an attacker who could

if one judges by IACIS email dump [3], then most investigators hardly

I don't think that buying the software would be that difficult. For a
big project, LE could outsource it to one of those shady companies
selling exploits, or (more likely) to a government contractor with
security clearance. For something smaller, a hungry grad student
should do, after making them sign an NDA, or, in case of a really
arrogant LE, some national secrecy act. Writing the service as
something innocent in accounting is probably par for the course.
Closer to the topic, I think that traffic correlation can be performed
in a distributed fashion, if you know the target IPs to watch for
(which can be gathered beforehand locally on exit nodes, and
aggregated and analyzed afterwards). Exit nodes that see packets
to/from target hosts aggregate their exact timestamps for a few
seconds, and then send the chunks to all other nodes (so yes, you
can't correlate too much traffic). All other (guard) nodes then try to
locally correlate the received packets with their own traffic, and
aggregate successes for later reports. In this fashion, each node
needs to keep perhaps a minute of timestamped traffic. It is also
possible to play with traffic / disk space / success probability
tradeoffs: send chunks to rotating sets of nodes, increase recorded
traffic window (to be able to send old chunks to nodes that didn't see
traffic to a given IP yet), etc.

Wrt. the first proof, it seems to me that the assumed correlation
accuracy rate of 99.9% is incredibly low, and I think that the Raccoon
recognized that by referring to sampling and retention at the end of
his post. With the targeted attack that's similar to bExample 3b in
Raccoon's post that I described in my previous comment here, where one
analyzes all exit traffic without missing packets, I would expect the
correlation accuracy (and as a result, match confidence) to
exponentially approach 100% very quickly with the number of relevant
packets seen, and extremely quickly if the traffic is interactive
(i.e., browsing).
Actually, c/n of 30% in bExample 3b is close to the 25% that's
discussed in the OP here, so let's redo the example with c/n=25% and
different correlation accuracies (leaving the other numbers intact):
(using bbc -lb)
ca  = 0.999
pm  = (1/5000) * (0.25)^2
ca*pm / (pm*ca + (1-pm)*(1-ca))
ca  = 0.999
ca = 0.9999
ca = 0.99999
ca = 0.999999
ca = 0.9999999
ca = 0.99999999
ca = 0.999999999
So reducing correlation accuracy error to 10^-9 will give you 99.99%
confidence in end-to-end correlation match. I suspect that a few
seconds of interactive traffic will give you a correlation accuracy
that's much better than a 10^-9 error.

I am yet to see evidence that quantum computing is viable for any

breakthrough, and in ability to still use finite fields-based

Mackall above, there is a frequent misconception that quantum
computers are anything like non-deterministic Turing machines b they
are not, and shuffling-based (i.e., symmetric-key, classical)

Tor is an infrastructure with a history of being developed and
researched by experts in network security and anonymity. Due to its
unique standing in the congregation of similar networks, Tor attracted
a fair amount of academic scrutiny, which resulted in many refinements
and extensions for resisting various types of attacks, and in
documenting its known weaknesses. While I dislike the excessive
stiffness of the project (RSA-1024? The 90's called, and they want
their bmilitary-grade encryptionb back) and inability to resist the
status quo (what again is the reason for not making nodes relay
traffic by default? beyond you publishing another conference paper on
the oh-so-terrible dangers of that in order to pad your CV, that is),
I trust the Tor project to produce something solid and to not grossly
overestimate its security and anonymity guarantees.
Tor Browser, on he other hand, is just some hack for mangling browser
headers. Who develops it? Who scrutinized it? Were it the same people
who recommended using the unstable and inadequate Polipo proxy
(over-64 MiB files? Nah, never heard of those) instead of
well-established Privoxy previously, due to some imaginary perceived
limitations of the latter (reading manuals is boring, I guess)? Is
there any evidence that Tor Browser prevents fingerprinting which is
marginally more sophisticated than looking at some subset of browser
headers regardless of their order? Or is the joke that is Panopticlick
with its bbits of identifying informationb as state-of-the-art as it
gets (mind you, I was able to fool it with Privoxy rules in LibertC),
masquerading as TBB, although I know that the specific browser in use

While this may be true in the theoretical sense, it doesn't mean that
one can't make correlation attacks less practical. I find it hard to
believe that right now NSA, for instance, has Tor traffic analysis
tightly integrated into its worldwide communications sniffing
framework, simply because it's too much of a logistic problem, and
anonymous networks are unlikely to be sufficiently high-profile
targets so as to warrant expending the resources to deal with the
logistics (yet). But I think that it is entirely believable that NSA
has a dedicated project (even if only for research purposes) where the
traffic from all known relays (a relatively stable pool of ~3000
nodes?) is sniffed and analyzed b that would be relatively simple to
setup and maintain, given the unlimited interception capabilities. And
you can combat the latter b by extending and popularizing the entry
bridges concept, implementing exit bridges, making all clients relays
by default (even if that won't contribute significant bandwidth), etc.

@_date: 2012-03-07 16:43:03
@_author: Maxim Kammerer

I think that's quite unlikely. The nodes must reside in commercial
data centers and run untrusted software (including necessarily
modified Tor clients), all of which exposes them to hacking risks and
to the resulting possibility of discovering the interception framework
employed (which is probably not unique to Tor, so that's a huge risk).
But one could try correlating Tor relays and Tor clients growth graphs
since, say, 2000 b if at some point there was a sharp growth in
USA-located relays without a corresponding growth in total clients,
and if those relays have similar bandwidth / data center quality
capabilities, then that could be "The Man".

[1] Not necessarily b you can generate the hash first, and then check

then go on with producing a completely random 512-bit e, and checking
whether SHA-1(ASN.1-RSAPublicKey(modulus=p*e, exponent=65537)) (which
is how Tor computes the .onion address) produces the desired result.
If it does, check whether e is prime. Density of primes in the range

primality checking efficiency doesn't matter much.

@_subject: [liberationtech] Bitcoin and The Public Function of Money 
I am not sure the situation is that simple. I believe (this is a long
thread) that the underlying question discussed here is whether Bitcoin
has a potential as a viable alternative unregulated currency. In order
to answer that, one has to first answer the question of what Bitcoin
is backed by. There are lots of demagogical claims on Bitcoin-related
discussion venues, but ultimately gold is backed by its scarcity,
longevity, and subcortex appeal of shiny things; fiat currency is
backed by state-protected ability to pay debt; MMORPG currencies are
exchangeable for game items; and Bitcoin, if one discards the time
period when it was worthless, is backed by its capacity to be
exchanged for illicit drugs on international black markets, due to
lack of better alternatives. *If* black markets are Bitcoin's claim to
fame, then it has absolutely no chance of becoming anything but a
small-scale under-the-radar drug trade currency, the reason being that
a thriving black market is an early sign of stagnating economy, chaos,
anarchy, and civil war, in which case people will revert to more
tangible currency alternatives like jewelry and food. There is a
widespread opinion that one of the major *economic* reasons for the
fall of Soviet Union was producers of goods (i.e., factories,
collective farms, etc.) establishing a massive black market between
them, avoiding the inflexible system of planned economy.
And this is where economic ideology and religious faith become
relevant, because according to libertarian views (which are at the
core of faith in Bitcoin) post-USSR republics, with their
well-educated population that was highly receptive to capitalistic
ideals, abundance of resources (natural and factories), extremely weak
governments, huge territory, etc. etc., should have somehow formed a
libertarian utopia with people-supported militias, thriving free
markets, and whatnot. What happened, however, was theft of all
available resources, rise of oligarchs who took control of factories,
dismantled them and sold the components abroad, organized banditism,
pervasive racketeering, demographical catastrophe, several civil wars
and population transfers, shortened life expectancy, and all other
complete opposites of an utopia. Contradiction? Only if one doesn't
use religious faith to reason about economic reality.

It is also not clear whether the server can decide to make a message

And of course, due to the centralized nature of the system,
CryptoHeaven can perform traffic analysis, building social networks of
correspondents, etc.
I am also not sure why they mention bnon-repudiation and anonymityb in
the FAQ. Non-repudiation is seen as problematic in encrypted
communications nowadays (together with lack of perfect forward
secrecy, which seems to be an attribute of the protocol as well), and
is differentiated from communication authenticity per se (e.g., see
OTR [4]). The claim of anonymity looks like an overstatement.

Thanks, getting it to work was a real pain. PAX / grsecurity kernel
patches had UEFI-related bugs, and the most suitable UEFI signing tool
(sbsigntool) lacked support for 32-bit EFI binaries. All of this is
now fixed / integrated upstream (sbsigntool is used in Ubuntu, by the
LibertC) ships its own Secure Boot certificate, which signs the GRUB
bootloader, and the trusted chain continues from there. After
experimenting with Secure Boot in OVMF builds, I think that enrolling
such a certificate is not difficult b it is not more difficult than
changing the order of boot devices in BIOS, for instance (back then
before a menu could be invoked by pressing a key). Most controversy
about Secure Boot support in Linux one finds online is about making
the process completely transparent for users, which requires either
using Microsoft-signed binaries (Fedora) / intermediate certificate,
or embedding one's keys in firmware (Ubuntu). If you forgo the
requirement of complete boot transparency, which I think is reasonable
for a special-purpose live distribution, using an own certificate is
an obvious choice.
