Actually, he had held other positions in the government before he was
information minister.  I assume it is those past roles which singled him out
for this list.

This reminds me of that old saw about the fellow who falls off a 100 story
"Floor 75, everythings still okay"
"Floor 50, still lookin good"
"Floor 25, situation nominal"
"Floor 5, feeling fine"
Unfortunately, there were some communication issues after he past floor 1.
We're still waiting for his final report.
Article III is the only one left in the bill of rights that is still adhered
to.  The others get dragged out every once in awhile, like an old general
who has outlived his usefulness and is now just a relic of past glory.

You are assuming that each phone number represents only one person, which in
most cases is incorrect.

(You left out cancer, AIDS, and supersized happy meals)
    Intolerant hate filled christian mind set?  How does this differentiate
christians from the muslims, jews, native americans (I can't believe you
were so insensitive as to call them Indians) or even atheists?
    Perhaps we should all give in to the fun-loving stalinist's.  They got
rid of God, and it worked out well for them (and for human rights,
economics, etc etc).
