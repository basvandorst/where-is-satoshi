@_subject: RFC re simple anti-censorship strategy 
(copy posted to alt.cypherpunks)
Motivated by Chiquita's recent censorship of the Cincinnati Inquirer -- and
more generally by the challenge of making suppressed documents available on
the web without exposing webmasters or their ISPs to legal liability --
I've developed a simple strategy.  The approach is similar to Adam Back's
Eternity Service in that it combines anonymous posts to Usenet with a
news-to-web interface.  Unlike Adam's approach, posts are not encrypted --
and are therefore easier to find and cancel.  OTOH, this approach is
easier, and does not require root privileges, to implement
Please see  for the
demonstration.  I welcome comments.
