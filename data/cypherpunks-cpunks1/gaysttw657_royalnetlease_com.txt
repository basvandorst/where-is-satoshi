say hi to gilbert and the kids with love km
and then i realized i love her so much
like this one for instance my older brother uploaded it while reminiscing about the old buggie he rebuilt in the 80s i spent a few hours organizing my yarn and needles into that armoire and then that got me thinking that really its not just while laying in bed that she is watching out for me what a few hours on a sunny day can do for you
i thought id live there forever one day when i was 12 my dad quit his job and we moved to lake tahoe it rocked my stable world and i think im done cutting kits for a while
im loving babies & mamas sunshine happy rooms and cool colors
it makes me too happy drawers full of yarn too glorious
cause that would make me happy
what im listening to this morningagain
remember how i was so proud that my room was clean and i was knitting well i still am guess what i finally put in the shop
and as ive been laying in my misery ive been thinking a lot about that penny and just how lonely id be if she wasnt there with me im just obsessed with him women who have these hormonal issues typically carry alot of weight around the middle (due to the out of control insulin and resultant too high of testosterone) and a high protein and fiber diet combined with low carbs really helps with that an added benefit is that these types of foods are so filling and you avoid the highs and crashes that people with blood sugar problems live by
i am determined
i spent a few years calming down my teen angst and attempting to grow up i loved san luis obispo i was ready to chill there for good cate did you love disney games on the computer when you were five
