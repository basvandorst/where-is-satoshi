Not that I am aware of.
This is due to the possible illegality.  Your "vaccine" would certainly
get investigated by any clued-in admin who noticed it.  You would possibly
get attention from some LEAs, regardless of your intentions.
A revised version of Code Red (called Code Red v2 or CRv2) was released
shortly after eEye discovered the original Code Red.  CRv2 had a much
better PRNG than the original Code Red worm, and did not attack the same
sequence of hosts.
The incidents at securityfocus.com list is probably tracking Code Red
infections and coordinating some soft of response to affected sites.
Ask Max Vision of whitehats.com what happened to him when he created a
program to patch vulnerable Internet software (bind, I think it was).  Oh
wait, he's in prison at the moment.  This probably had something to do
with him planting a backdoor along with the fix, but I wouldn't risk it.

Dude, Adobe made a complaint about software produced by Sklyarov's
employer, Elcomsoft.
