@_subject: CALLER ID? 
Years ago, when I crossed the country with a regular cell-phone, I tried
calling another ANI demo at points along the way.  The result was just
the same, in a couple different calling areas: the demo always read back
some strange number with the area code of the place I was in.
I figured it must just go out of some line at the cell-site like a regular
phone call.  I never tried calling the number that was read back though.

@_subject: Wireless Networks info request... 
This is beginning to stray from the realm of the cypherpunks, but the thread
on wireless networks has gotten me interested, and I'd like pointers to more
Does anyone have plans for building wireless network controllers?  What
commercial companies are out there besides TAL?  Where is this sort of thing
discussed regularly (usenet, mailing lists, etc.)?
Any intel would be appreciated.
