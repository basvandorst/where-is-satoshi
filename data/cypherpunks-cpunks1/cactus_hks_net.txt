distinction betweem original message and additional stuff is maintained.

A number of people have asked me what SKIP is.  IBM's patent covered modular key management in a manner that isn't
clear to me.
SKIP is Simple Key management for Internet Protocols: it's an elegant
key management system that uses Diffie-Hellman public keys (Aziz notes
that any DH-like scheme will work).  The IPsec folks wanted (or just
were considering it?) to use it in their secure IP work, but were balking
at the patent status.

@_author: L. Todd Masco 
@_subject: GUCAPI (Grand Unified Crypto API) 
I've been thinking a lot recently about how to implement a generic API for
crypto such that the interface could be independent of the cipher used.
What I'm thinking of is something like:
So, to encrypt a PGP-style message, you'd:
Which would initialize whatever random vectors you're likely to need for
a PGP session and allocate the appropriate space to the pointers.  The
types should be totally opaque, implemented in the library.
Which would generate a session key for IDEA and grow the keys structure
Which would grow the keys structure and add in appropriate RSA keys.  (Alternatively, it could be done as one vector with all the recipients
Which would encrypt the IDEA session key with the appropriate RSA key and
the input with the IDEA session key. And,
Which would put the messages into the appropriate (Radix-64?) format and
put it out to the output, (the output structure would specify whether
memory is to be allocated and filled, files written to, whatever).
My goal is to come up with an API that could be integrated once into an
application and would be flexible enough that new crypto methods, whether
ciphers or key management, could be supported entirely by upgrading the
library.  This includes being flexible enough to cover as diverse
methods as OTPs (where the init function would open a file or other
pad as its "random vector," key retrieval would be a noop, and encode
would just XOR) and PEM (key management would be done on the basis of
the method specified.  I'm fuzzy on how to generalize key management
into a model that would include both web-of-trust and PEM-style certificates,
so conversation on this would be greatly appreciated).
It seems to me that the benefits are pretty clear: Set up such an API
as a spec that can be implemented both inside and outside of the US and
it allows everybody to implement to one API.  There's no good reason to
have a bazillion different crypto APIs if a generalized one can be I've posted about this before and received no response: since I'd like to
solidify the API soon so I can firm up the coding I'm doing, I ask that
folks take the time to comment.  The code I end up producing will be publicly available, possibly as a "non-commercial use" copyright, perhaps

More or less.  It doesn't need to implement everything straight off: the
API itself just has to pass all the information that's necessary.  > >My goal is to come up with an API that could be integrated once into an

 > Actually, I'm not talking about implementing the library in a multi-platform
way.  Once the API is specified, people could be found who would do the implementation for any given platform.  I'd do a UNIX version that would
straight off translate appropriate calls to RSAREF for RSA calls and
implement IDEA.  A friend of mine is interested in doing the PC version .
Encryption is a pretty straightforward process in the abstract:  While
such an API might not be well suited to hyper-fast stream methods, it would
be Good Enough to have something that could be integrated into mail and
news easily.  News and mail are doing the same thing: a big part of the
difficulty in getting integrated support is in the cumbersome interface
to PGP and the percieved short horizon on PGP changes.  If a unified API
promised that a crypto API would stay put, I think more people would be
hacking code.
I'm not talking about implementing it all at once.  In essence,
a PGP engine that used these calls would be useful because people could
implement MUAs and newsreaders (and perhaps web browsers) that easily
integrated PGP encryption by linking with the newest version of the PGP
distribution: and then, as newer methods and formats came along, all
that would be required would be a relink to support new formats (another
function, BTW, would be a guc_parse_format() that would determine the
format of the input).
Only the spec itself need be exported, no crypto code or even hooks.
RSAREF would have to be part of the RSA methods inside the US: outside, it
would probably end up being the old PGP code that the current 2.6ui-style
PGPs use.

Certainly, some APIs are much better than others.  The C stdlib, for
example, is a pretty good API.  Stdio does a very good job of abstracting
concepts to calls that work across filesystems as different as VMS's
RMS and MS-DOS filesystems.  I'm talking about C -- not every platform
supports C++.  The OS isn't important: the API can be implemented

(Following details of the current system might be wrong.  Please correct
 me where necessary.)
My thought is this: If we were to design and implement a system, perhaps
a two-tiered system with "fortress" and "intermediary" remailers as has
been suggested, it's desirable to build a system that will continue to
work even if a large portion of the nodes are removed (whether by Earthquake
of Sun Devil).  This is the system we'll have to build if we stop resisting
the notion that remailers regularly come and go with little warning.
The rendezvous problem is not currently addressed in a satisfactory way:
premail/remailer-ping, or its equivalent, hardwires in the location of
a known set of remailers and finds the subset that corresponds to
remailers having a common characteristic (usually just whether they're
working reliably or not).  That's not a very good approach: a human has to add a new remailer into
the "net" by adding it to the systems polled.  Not only is the human
intervention a Bad Thing, but having a central registry of remailers
is bad infrastructure.  A more "web-of-trust"-like mechanism is desirable.
So, a dispersed view of the remailer net, both entry points and intermediary
points, is necessary.  In order to build such a system, we must solve the
rendezvous problem: how does "premail++" know where to send its mail and
how does remailer A know where to find remailer B (and B find exit point C)?
This is where my train of thought dovetails with the newsgroup question:
bringing a new remailer on line could be achieved by broadcasting a message
through a newsgroup specifying the location and type of the remailer.  If
necessary, one or more pseudonymous automatic testing agents could pick up
the message and put the remailer through a barrage of tests, broadcasting
a "remailer certification" with a certain duration.  "Premail++" and
remailers could find their next hop by examining current certifications
and choosing one with desired characteristics, scoring by trusted testing
agents and other criteria (including the passage of time since the last
certification).  If an exit-remailer is chosen early in the game, multiple
paths to the exit-remailer can be used to improve reliability (exit-
remailers would also probably have a shorter cycle of certification).
Technically, this is feasible.  I could write the code fairly easily (though
I'm not offering to do so at this time: if I do, pieces will be offered as
fait accompli).  My question is whether this strikes anybody else as a
desirable design: we would end up with a net of remailers that is fairly
resilient and not dependent upon any one list of remailers.  If a node
goes down, the net adjusts in rather short order and service is not
disrupted.  This picture needs to be fleshed out a bit more, but I thought I'd bounce
this around before solidifying it in any particular way.

I can forge a flurry of unsubscribe requests (turn the list off) and set up the same list on another host (turn it on) at will.  All of us
can do this with varying degrees of difficultly.  Who owns the list?
(Substitute any denial of service attack for "turning off the list" if
you're not convinced of the strength of the forged unsubscribes.)  The list is not the software it runs on: nobody cares very much whether it
runs on toad.com or c2.org except in avoiding the inconvenience of
updating pointers.  This is not a specious argument: in practice, people
do take lists of subscribers to other machines.  See recent traffic on
list-maintainers for examples from exclusively professional scientific
As I went on to say, arguing the "ownership" of the list is absurd... it's more reasonable (and productive) to discuss actions and their
expected consequences.
I think the only thing that will keep people from immediately stomping
away is that Eric has a strong reputation totally separate from his
"bureaucratic" role of list maintainer.  It remains to be seen how much
that affects peoples' behaviors and how much respect he will lose for
coercing, however mildly, people into using signatures.

Not at all.  I'm making no positive claim: I just do not see any particular
reason to consider the list Eric's.  Perhaps you should clarify what you
mean by "the list": do you mean the set of bits that describe the mailing
addresses of every person on the list or do you simply mean the instance
of majordomo running on toad.com with the previous bit stream loaded?
I'm thinking of the former as being "the list" and thus squarely in the
realm of intellectual property and all the snags that entails.
If it's the latter you're referring to, sure, we can call it "Eric's."  But
so what?  That and a subway token will get you to Brooklyn.  My main point,
which you keep dropping off, is that the instantiation of the set of mailing
addresses at a particular site is a relatively minor factor in the
continuity of a mailing list.

The general IO section skeleton is finished, and all file I/O and memory
I/O types are supported.  Encoding rules now fully coded in are rot13 (for
simple testing), uuencode, and radix64.  There are also unfilled stubs
for DER/BER at the moment.  I'm about to start in on the framework for crypto code and key management:
Any ideas on handling a generalized concept of keys will be greatly
appreciated!  For instance, I've asserted several times here that
X.509 keys can be fully modelled as special cases of PGP web-of-trust
keys with one additional field, the expiration time.  Nobody has flamed me, but
nobody has agreed with me... since I've only read the X.509 spec and never
actually used them, I'd like some assurance that I'm not missing some
subtleties in this approach.
The general I/O is fairly slow, since items are fetched in blocks
appropriate for the encoding (IE, radix 64 maps 4 bytes r64 to 3 bytes
binary);  I might put the effort into optimizing it later, but my gut
feeling is that the crypto is going to be at least an order of magnitude
Now, the general outline of what I'm building.  This is pretty much the
same as what I've posted before.  I do want to note that all I/O is
locking, using a library of locking versions of I/O fns I sent to some
folks here a while ago.

@_subject: Key management in Hastur 
Eric, if I understand you correctly, you're saying that the manner in
which trust is bestowed in keys should not be generalized.  Is this
correct?  I don't have a problem with that, and wasn't terribly interested
in defining trust parameters.  I do want to finish this in the next 4 to 6
weeks, after all.
However, that's not exactly the problem I'm trying to solve;  The phrase
"key management" is likely too vague or perhaps has specific connotations
that I'm unaware of, such that I'm using it wrongly.  I was never strong
on jargon, and "key management" is the phrase that came closest to an
expression of the problem I'm trying to solve.
The problem is this: You have a bitstream and you want to perform
a cryptographic function on it.  Therefore, you need a key.  For RSA
functions, I know of two different ways that keys are distributed:
PGP and X.509.  My intent is to support PGP keyrings and PEM-style
keyrings (I am not yet familiar with the latter)... having a way to
place keys into their proper keyrings would be nice, too, but there's
no way I'm going to worry about that in the first rev.  Would I be
understanding you correctly if I characterized your advice as being
to not plan to implement that at all?
There are two ways that I could approach handling keys in the code:
In either case, there must be an import function, extracting the key from
the appropriate keyrings or otherwise supplying the key.  Including functions
that extract keys from the appropriate PGP/PEM keyrings would be a Good
Thing and is right now The Plan: one can hardly expect the code to get
used if it needs Yet Another (undefined) Key Distribution method.
My X.509 vs PGP key question boils down to this: is it reasonable to try to
convert keys of one sort into keys of the other sort, providing the
functionality of converting a key obtained through an X.509 certificate
into a PGP-key?  Converting the other seems like a less desirable thing
to do, so I'm not really thinking about that problem.
I should note that in all cases in HCT where something is parameterized,
the caller can supply a callback function that matches the defined
interface and expect to win.  Thus, it's already supported (in the
general interface and soon the key handling) that a user could say
(in pseudo C code, missing parameters):
          /* ... Do the right thing, etc. */
        }
Are we on a similar wavelength here, or am I totally missing the point?
The input is appreciated.

I simply can't think much of a magazine that has cover stories deriving
entirely from kiddie-kracker squabbles.
Kelly may have plenty of integrity but that's not the word that the
magazine "Wired" usually brings to mind.  It's not the profit motive or
the ads that get me: running a business, I know you can't be picky about
who you take money from. It's the lack of meaningful content that annoys
me.  As with Lewis, frequenly when they're discussing something I know
something about their stories are fraught with inaccuracies and rumours.
My personal favorite is when they list reporters among the "experts" on
their technology-watch light bites.
Their entire approach is to cast Like "Seventeen," "Wired" should prepend "don't you wish you were" to
its title.

Not really, not until a huge number of hosts carry it as a newsgroup.
As for why cypherpunks isn't a newsgroup... IMO, it would end up carrying
too much traffic and be way too high profile.
As is, the people who really want to find it will and a hordes of riff-raff
(not all, mind you) are less likely to bother with it.

@_subject: Status of GUCAPI 
I'm just about done with the first part of my crypto library, the
internal generalized I/O, and largely done with the framework for the
encoding rules.  Since I haven't fully outlined what I'm doing here,
I thought I'd mention the outline in the hopes of getting some real
feedback and perhaps some random snipets of code.
In essence, what I'm building is a crypto library that takes a very general
approach with a few parameters controlling its behavior.  The idea is
to have something that anybody can drop into their mail agent and have
an easy way of using crypto and interface with existing systems such as
PGP.  A major design goal is to be backwards compatable with PGP, but
paramount is having a plug-and-play library that will be flexible enough
to meet future crypto needs.
One of the biggest problems today is that crypto libraries are chiselled out
to deal with very specific cases -- the most general I know of if is RSAREF,
which AFAIK only supports BER/DER for encoding and RSA and DES/CBC for encryption.  I'll grow more clueful on that, and other crypto and key
management issues, as I get to actually working on them.
The things that I've parametrized in the design are:
There's some other stuff that I'm probably forgetting here, but that's
the gist of it.  The cipher code is going to be pretty simple: I'm
getting a lot of code from various places on the net;  the code exists,
it just isn't put into a form that is easy to use.  The most difficult is
going to be a generalized scheme for key management: first off, I'm probably
going to simply use PGP's web-of-trust as my model, assuming the X.509/PEM
style certificates can be treated as degenerate cases of web of trust.
I also intend to offer a GSSAPI interface to all of this, as seems
appropriate when I get to it.
This is so far all in C: I'm not a C++ convert yet and C is still the
most portable of the languages about.  Later, perhaps class libraries
can be designed around the same code.
Thoughts?  Am I wasting my time, or is this a worthwhile pursuit?
And should I find a better name than GUCAPI?

If anybody ever actually uses the cypherpunks archives via NNTP on hks.net,
please let me know immediately (we don't log).  I'm probably going to be
putting a reasonable expire time on the group and archive the articles at
expire time: if people use it, I can set up a "cypherpunks archive group"
for NNTP access.
This won't affect folks who use the NNTP access to read cypherpunks
normally: I'll probably set the expire time to something like a month.

Not knowing netscape, I couldn't tell you.  The newsgroup name should
probably be in there, tho: it's hks.lists.cypherpunks on nntp.hks.net.
The URL might be something like "nntp://nntp.hks.net/hks/lists/cypherpunks"
or "nntp://nntp.hks.net/hks.lists.cypherpunks", but I'm just guessing.

@_subject: Cypherpunks vs. Coderpunks 
I think you're misinterpreting what's going on.  Participants in the Coderpunks list are not generally abandoning Cypherpunks.  Some people
who have long been absent from the Cypherpunks list have joined it, but
I've seen posts from most of the Cypherpunk participants of Coderpunks on Cypherpunks since it was formed.
My concern is that the two lists will become more disjoint than they
already are.  I believe that the content of Cypherpunks is enhanced by having
the programmers present, just as the coders benefit from the guidance of seeing
the possibilities opened by their endeavors.
The remailers network is the most obvious example of the benefits of this synergy.
I'd hate to see us lose later rewards that could otherwise be reaped.
I don't believe that it'll be sociopolitical content that'll chase
the coders away: if the constant fighting over indisputable metaphysics
doesn't do it, the fighting over who was killfiled by whom first
and who's a total loon will.

@_subject: META: Filtering/Posting advice 
"I have a concern..."
Cypherunks First: Stipulated that any traffic has a 'right' to be on cypherpunks.
However, cypherpunks is what we make it.  Every time you post a message,
consider the desirability of seeing a hundred or so messages just
like it from every other readers' point of view.  Content control begins at home.
Second: I'll remind the reader that one can easily evaluate an
individual's past contributions to cypherpunks by looking at the archives'
"by author" listing.  If you post to cypherpunks, I'd suggest that you
go back and look at what you've posted in the past to get a feel for
how other people on the list see you.
Third: Filtering isn't just a game for the vocal: as noise begets noise, I'd
encourage everybody to filter out people whose prose they simply
can not stand.  While this is an important aspect to creating a more
readable list, I can't imagine anybody really caring who else has been
"plonked": to me, in seems no more than a preadolescent "nyah nyah, I'm
not listening..."
I'm half- (only half-, as I'm a free-speech absolutist) tempted to write a tool
that would automatically remove any person from cypherpunks who posts a
"plonk" message.  Until the total lack of security in majordomo is addressed,
this is a game that anybody who can telnet to an smtp port can play.
Fourth: Cypherpunks is fast becoming a ghetto.  My first reaction (which I
did not follow) to several crypto posts in the last few days has been to refer
the posters to coderpunks.  While there is some signal that will always
remain uniquely suited to cypherpunks (Tim May's contributions, Strata's
response to JPB, and Jim Bell's Assassination idea -- though not all of the
messages he's sent since -- immediately come to mind), any signal
that has another place to migrate will do so if the noise issue isn't addressed
better.  Words of wisdom from the past:
 This program posts news to thousands of machines throughout the entire
 civilized world.  Your message will cost the net hundreds if not thousands of
 dollars to send everywhere.  Please be sure you know what you are doing.
 Are you absolutely sure that you want to do this? [ny]
IE, please... if you aren't adding *new* *signal* to the list, please
refrain from posting.  If you must flame a person, do it in private email.
