@_subject: untraceable phone calls 
When the information is obtained from the phone company ( in this case MCI) for "untraceable" phone calls, what kind of data will I receive?  Is there ever any way to break this down to something usable?  My problem is harrasing phone calls that appear to be coming from out of state but I believe are actually coming from a cell phone is state.  Any ideas or helpful hints would be very very appreciated.
