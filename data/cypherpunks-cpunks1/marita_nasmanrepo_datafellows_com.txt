DATA FELLOWS AND SONERA JOIN FORCES TO CREATE SECURE VPN SERVICES FOR THE
NEXT MILLENIUM
Espoo, Finland, December 1, 1998 -- Data Fellows, the leading global
security solutions vendor, and Sonera, the leading Finnish
telecommunications service provider, have announced a partnership to create
next-generation Intranet and extranet services.
The scope of the partnership is to develop a secure IP service platform by
combining Sonera's leading-edge telecommunications services with Data
Fellows' award-winning secure VPN and anti-virus products.
"Security is not a simple issue. We see leading telecommunications service
providers in a key position to help corporate customers reap the benefits
of the Internet without the inherent risks," says Risto Siilasmaa, CEO of
Data Fellows. "Over the years, Sonera has always paved the way with
innovative telecommunications services. Well-managed strong security is the
logical next step."
"Our key challenges are the increasing demand for mobility and the
increasing use of extranets between companies," says Jukka T Leinonen,
Managing Director of Sonera Solutions. "Managed IP-based virtual private
networks with a functioning Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and strong
security constitute the foundation for future corporate information
systems. Data Fellows can provide us with standards-based, proven security
with globally available strong encryption." The first products and services
will be announced early next year.  Data Fellows' groundbreaking F-Secure products provide a unique combination
of globally available strong encryption, revolutionary anti-virus software
and policy based management. Data Fellows products are relied on by the
world's largest industrial corporations, best-known telecommunications
companies and major airlines, several European governments, post offices
and defence forces as well as several of the world's largest banks. Data

Press Release				For immediate release Data Fellowsï¿½ F-Secure VPN+ demo An easy way to test strong Internet encryption
Espoo, Finland, December 11, 1998. - Data Fellows, one of the worldï¿½s
leading developers of anti-virus and encryption software, has set up a demo
of the commercial version of F-Secure VPN+, whereby companies can test an
encrypted IPSec connection between their own machine and a VPN+ Server at
the Data Fellows site. The supported platform is Windows NT 4.0 (Intel)
with an Ethernet network adapter. The release works on both single and
multi-processor machines.
An encrypted IPSec connection can be set up by downloading and installing
the F-Secure VPN+ Demo Client, available at the Data Fellows web site
( and connecting
through it to the F-Secure VPN+ server. This set-up in no way affects a
companyï¿½s other network traffic; all other hosts and network services may
be accessed as usual. Unlike the commercial version of VPN+, it is not
possible to create encrypted connections to hosts other than
VPNPlus.DataFellows.com. This server cannot be contacted without the VPN+
demo client.
The demo client has been configured to establish an IPSec encrypted (3des)
connection to VPNPlus.DataFellows.com (IP:194.252.6.42). A random session
key will be negotiated for each connection. Host authentication is
performed using a shared secret 0x462D534543555245 (i.e. "F-SECURE" in
hex). Access to all other networks (local/Internet) is provided without
additional IPSec security. In the commercial version of F-Secure VPN+, the network administrator
determines which connections are permitted and which connections need to be
encrypted. The commercial version of the product features F-Secure
Administrator for central management, network wide security policy
distribution and F-Secure VPN+ Certificate Wizard for a complete VPN
Certificate Authority service. In addition to F-Secure VPN+ Demo Client, a Lotus ScreenCam presentation of
F-Secure Administrator can be downloaded, as well as the userï¿½s manual of
the commercial version. The presentation shows how easily the network
administrator can create and maintain a security policy for the whole
Virtual Private Network.
End-user installation of the commercial version can be done using AUTOINST
network-wide deployment tools and it provides a fully transparent network
security solution to the user. No user-interfaces are left to the user to
stumble with.

Crypto-Sales at DataFellows.com DATA FELLOWS SHIPS F-SECURE FILECRYPTO New Product Provides On-the-Fly Protection For Sensitive Data on Personal
HELSINKI, FINLAND, October 9, 1998  -- Data Fellows, a leading developer of
data security software has started to ship F-Secure FileCrypto. The new
product provides strong, on-the-fly encryption for confidential data in the
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 environment. "F-Secure FileCrypto is the only file encryption product on the market
designed for companies with thousands of PCs," says Mr. Camillo Sars,
Product Development Manager, Data Fellows. "The protection of confidential
files has never been this easy. F-Secure FileCrypto is installed over the
entire network, and automatically encrypts all files, including temporary
files created by programs and the operating system during running. The
process is completely transparent to end-users, requiring no action from
them at all." The administrator can define a security policy for all installed copies of
F-Secure FileCrypto. F-Secure FileCrypto will have a full support for
centralized policy-based management later this fall.
The program also features a key retrieval function. If a user forgets the
password that allows access to encrypted files, the Administrative Key
Recovery function manages the situation safely and easily.
According to Mr. Sars, "F-Secure FileCrypto is one of the first products to
integrate strong real-time encryption into the Windows file system. It
automatically encrypts data before it gets stored on the hard disk,
protecting sensitive information even in the most demanding situations. If
a PC is improperly turned off, or if a laptop computerï¿½s batteries go dead,
any open or temporary files will be encrypted and safe."
F-Secure FileCrypto also has a feature which allows users to send encrypted
e-mail to other users. Encrypted e-mail can be decrypted with a password.
F-Secure FileCrypto uses well-known fast block cipher algorithms. Either
the three-key 3DES or the Blowfish algorithm can be selected. Both
algorithms have been analyzed by the worldï¿½s leading cryptographers and are
known to be strong and safe.
"Files protected by F-Secure FileCrypto are not accessible to computer
freaks, hackers, or even cryptography experts. Each file is encrypted with
a random session key. Breaking a single key would give someone access to
only one file, and the job would consume trillions of years of computer
time," says Mr. Sars.
F-Secure FileCrypto for Windows NT 4.0 is now available from the Data
Fellows resellers around the world. Central installation and management
features will be implemented in the next release of the product. F-Secure
FileCrypto for Windows 95/98 will be available next year.

For your information:
Data Fellows Introduces F-Secure NameSurfer Version 2.0   SAN JOSE, CA -- Data Fellows, the global leader in Internet security
solutions, has today announced the new version 2.0 of its F-Secure
NameSurfer DNS (Domain Name System) management tool. DNS translates host names to IP addresses and is a critical component of
any IP based network. F-Secure NameSurfer provides network managers an
easy- to-use Web interface for DNS administration, saving time and
maintenance resources. Its intuitive graphical user interface and automatic
error checking prevent network managers from generating faulty DNS data.
Faulty DNS data can bring down the entire IP network, so correctness of DNS
data is essential for reliable and secure Internet and intranets. F-Secure NameSurfer 2.0 has been extensively restructured to achieve
peerless performance in the markets, especially in large DNS installations.
The new version also makes it possible to prevent the network manager from
creating address records whose IP address falls outside his own network.
Thus, ISPs can give their customers the permission to change addresses and
still be sure that customers stay in their own network zone. F-Secure NameSurfer translates into significant savings in network
management. The intuitive graphical user interface saves network managers'
time in doing DNS configurations. The configurations can be done remotely
and by multiple network managers with personal administration rights. The
routine tasks can be delegated to clerical staff. Ultimately even end-users
or ISP customers can administer their own DNS data, with a Web browser, as
a self-service. Prime target customer groups for F-Secure NameSurfer are telecommunication
operators, Internet Service Providers (ISP), and other organizations that
need the best tool in the markets to manage Internet or intranet security.
Among F-Secure NameSurfer customers are ISPs like US WEST INTERACT,
Concentric Network Corporation, and The Finnish University and Research
Network, as well as international corporate customers such as Barclays Bank
PLC, Motorola Semiconductor Product Services, and UPM-Kymmene.
F-Secure NameSurfer 2.0 is now available from Data Fellows' resellers
around the world. The product is available for all the popular Unix
platforms. Pricing starts at $990.
With offices in San Jose, CA, and Helsinki, Finland, privately-owned Data
Fellows is the leading technology provider of data security solutions for
computer networks and desktop computers. The company's F-Secure data
security product line includes the groundbreaking F-Secure Anti-Virus,
which facilitates two of the world's best scanning engines, F-PROT
Professional and AVP, within the same system for unparalleled virus
detection rates; F-Secure SSH for securing all popular TCP/IP applications;
and F-Secure VPN for creating secure virtual private networks. The
company's products are relied on by many of the world's largest companies,
governments, universities and institutions. The products are available
world-wide in more than 80 countries through Data Fellows and its business
partners. For more information, please contact USA: Data Fellows Inc.

For immediate release.
September 25, 1998
Data Fellows to integrate BackWeb's technology into CounterSign architecture Helsinki, Finland, September 25, 1998 - Data Fellows Ltd., a leading data
security vendor, and BackWeb Technologies, a leader in push solutions for
Knowledge Distribution, today announced an agreement to integrate BackWebï¿½s
Polite Server and Agent technology into Data Fellowsï¿½ CounterSign
management architecture. The CounterSign architecture provides a scalable,
policy-based framework for managing the security infrastructure. By including BackWeb technology in Data Fellows products, protection
against security breaches reaches the highest level, as the security system
will automatically and transparently keep itself up-to-date during idle
time online. BackWebï¿½s solution will complement the existing Internet
update technology in F-Secure security products, which include F-Secure
Workstation Suite, F-Secure Anti-Virus, F-Secure FileCrypto, F-Secure VPN+,
F-Secure SSH and F-Secure NameSurfer. "Combining our integrated security solutions with BackWebï¿½s Polite
distribution technology provides clear benefits to corporate customers in
todayï¿½s insecure Internet environments," said Risto Siilasmaa, President
and CEO of Data Fellows. "The use of bandwidth-friendly and scaleable push
technology is a natural extension of our strong Internet approach." F-Secure utilizes BackWebï¿½s new client, which allows data transfer to
customer networks securely even through firewalls. Administrators of
corporate networks will be able to make the decision about deploying a
particular version update in their networks, on a case-by-case basis, if
they prefer to evaluate the updates before deployment. This type of
implementation ensures that customers always have the latest versions on
hand and are able to follow company security policy on software
distribution. Data Fellows will also utilize the BackWeb broadcast channel
for delivering alerts as well as relevant product service and support
information to the corporate administrators and to its partners world-wide. Data Fellowsï¿½ future plans include establishing partnerships with ISPs for
using BackWebï¿½s push technology and its down- and upstream capabilities to
enable ISPs to find new sources of revenue from value-added services, such
as well-managed security services.
