HERE'S LOOKING AT YOU, SENSAR
By Peter D. Henig Red Herring Online
November 3, 1998
You walk out the door and down the street to find the closest ATM machine,
but reaching into your wallet -- "oops" -- you forgot your cash card.
Don't you hate that?
Well, if Sensar, a biometrics manufacturer of iris identification products
has anything to say about it, you'll soon be tossing that ATM card in the
Sensar has announced the world's largest ever combined equity investment in
the field of personal electronic identification -- which is actually a
bigger deal than you might think.
Moving a step closer, as the company puts it, "toward making PINs and
passwords obsolete," Citibank, NCR, J.P. Morgan, Lehman Brothers, Merrill
Lynch's wholly-owned subsidiary, KECALP Inc., and others have invested an
aggregate of $28 million in Sensar as the company attempts to further roll
out its iris identification pilot programs around the world in the hopes of
owning this futuristic segment of the biometrics market targeted at the
financial services and banking industries.
Who cares?
Who cares about equity stakes in biometrics companies?
Good question, and the same one we asked when the company came a-pitching us
their story.
It turns out, however, that biometrics is -- as Sensar likes to remind us --
an emerging technology that could soon turn into a hot, if not huge, market
around the globe.
With the initial results of their European pilot program (set up in a small
city outside London), it's "going very, very well, and I do mean very well."
According to Per-Olof Loof, Senior Vice President of NCR's Financial
Solutions Group, Sensar is pumped to push forward with its iris recognition
products, shooting for commercial roll out in 1999, and a real ramp up of
shipping product by 2000 and 2001.
The Sensar Secure Iris Identification System is currently being used in NCR
ATMs and at teller stations at Nationwide Building Society, the United
Kingdom's largest savings and loan. Sensar's Iris Identification product was
also used by professional athletes for access control and security at the
1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Citibank, an equity investor, has
also launched an in-house pilot program using its employees to test iris
scan technology.
And just how big is this market?
While company officials wouldn't be pinned down on specific forecasts, Mr.
Olof noted that there are 20 billion customer transactions annually on NCR
ATM machines alone, and that NCR has 37 percent market share. That's not a
bad partner for a private company like Sensar to have.
Moreover, Tom Drury, president and CEO of Sensar noted that there are
currently 900,000 ATMs worldwide and 160,000 new machines shipping each
The unique aspect of Sensar's products is that you may not even be aware
you're being watched.
Sensar's iris identification products use standard video cameras and
real-time image processing to acquire a picture of a person's iris (the
colored portion of the eye), digitally encode it, and compare it with one on
file -- all in the space of a few seconds. It allows for highly accurate
identification (comparing features across a whole database) and verification
(comparing features with a single template) in a user friendly environment;
second in accuracy only to retina identification using sans-laser beams.
In layman's terms, this might mean opening up an account at your local bank
by simply sitting down, having them take a snapshot of your eyeballs, and
then hitting the ATMs or tellers for some cash.
According to the company, iris recognition uses digitally encoded images of
the iris to provide a highly accurate, easy-to-use and virtually fraud-proof
means to verify a customer's identity. With 266 identification
characteristics, the iris is the human body's most unique physical
structure. And unlike other measurable human features in the face, hand,
voice or fingerprint, the patterns in the iris do not change over time;
receeding hairlines be damned.
They're not alone
"This landmark agreement puts iris identification light years ahead of any
other personal electronic identification technology," said Mr. Drury.
"Clearly, this agreement validates Sensar's product as the most accurate,
customer-friendly, cost effective personal electronic identification product
ever developed."
That's not bad cheerleading, but Sensar is clearly not the only biometric
firm in the identification market's field of vision.
According to the Gartner Group (IT
), Miros and
Visionics were the first companies to enter the facial recognition market,
although facial recognition tends to be a less accurate means of
identification. These two companies offer far cheaper products than Sensar,
and are targeting applications to such markets as PC and network access and
online transactions. Sensar, however, will also be designing for and
marketing to the online environment, as it envisions iris technology hitting
the desktop environment.
While the Gartner Group forecasts that the more widely accepted fingerprint
recognition techniques will be the remote access standard of choice through
2001, it also predicts that "aggressive financial organizations will begin
full-scale rollouts of iris recognition for tellers and ATMs by 2000."
Hence, the $28 million equity stake in Sensar by this highbrow club of
financial institutions.
By 2002, Gartner analysts predict iris recognition will be the biometric of
choice, an area where IrisScan Inc. holds an exclusive patent. (Sensar uses
the iris recognition process developed and licensed from IriScan, Inc., and
has the exclusive use of that technology for all financial services
And as far as exit strategy goes, everybody, including Sensar, still has
dreams of Silicon Valley dollars dancing in their heads.
"We have a classic Silicon Valley entrepreneurial team," said Mr. Drury, who
is located in New Jersey, "and we consider an IPO as a definite exit
We'll be watching.

Sorry, everyone, for this crap coming up, but JIM CHOATE wants you all to
see it...
You keep reposting this to the cpunx list, and I keep trying to discuss it
with you in private.
X says:
~> > If I had thought you were serious about your article, I would

And Jim's witty response was:
~> I'm waiting...
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the gist of your system was a two-tiered
payment schedule where Group A could be called TaxPayers and Group B could
be called NON-Payers.  Right?
And basically, Group A would get all of the benefits that a fully paid
membership would entail, right?  Secondly, Group B would "not pay taxes" and
would NOT be entitled to any benefits save for on a pay-as-you-go type
arrangement.  Right?
What USGov't services do you include in your proposal?  Let's list a few,
(feel free to jump in with some more.)
U.S. Mail services
Common defense
Air traffic controlling
roadways and interstates
Food and Drug Administration approvals
Federally mandated minimum wage
automobile safety standards
Is your tax progressive or regressive?
If I'm right so far (which I may or may not be) then we have to talk about
your definition of "paying taxes."  Does a single woman raising five kids
and paying a small mortgage making  $14,200 per year pay taxes?  No,
unfortunately for her, she doesn't.  I guess that puts her smack into GROUP
B!  Well, that's simple enough!  We'll deny her the creature comforts of the
list above until she chips in her proportionate cost, right?  When that
libertarian bitch tries to send mail, we'll charge her more!  WHen she gets
on the freeway, we'll toll her!  When she buys a medicine for her snot-nosed
urchin, we'll give her the stuff that ain't been FDA approved, right?
RIGHT!  And, if ever we should need to attack another country (or defend
ours, as you pointed out) SHE'LL happily volunteer to serve (as I remember
your post) in order to protect her TAX-FREE STATUS.
As you said to me, she's probably just looking for someone to shoulder her
part of the load, right?
You said it would be easy to implement, right?  I don't see that it would be
easy at all.
Once again, I apologize for the OFF TOPIC nature of this, but MR. COHATE
(freudian slip, or merely coincidence?  you be the judge!) insisted on
duking this out in public.

A DNA Database can actually be used for many nifty things that will improve
the lives of taxpayers and consumers alike.  For example, if we only had the
resources to sample DNA from every American, then cross reference that DNA
with, say, their CREDIT REPORT, then we'd know what type of genetic make-up
has a predisposition toward not paying their bills and we'd save so many
untold billions of dollars by not lending those genetic deadbeats any more
money.  Interest rates would plummet!  Plus, if you had the _right_ DNA,
they could just approve you on the spot!
If we had a DNA sample of all world citizens, then the pesky problem of the
whole "it was either O.J. that was the killer or there's a one in five
billion chance it was someone else" would simply disappear.
And, just think of the social improvements:  why, if you forget to ask the
name of last nights suitor, you can scrape some DNA samples off the end of
your cat-o-nine-tails, slip it into your M.S. DNA Reader(tm) and instantly
add them to your outlook addressbook.  (That is, if they have good credit,

Does anyone know what the airlines do with the info they collect off the ID?
Are they just noting whether the names match, or is it more sinister?
When I was below legal drinking age (21 in my state) I would drive up to the
window (how barbaric!  liquor sales to guys in cars!) and give the
sub-moronic guy my REAL ID under the assumption that:  he expects it to say
something that proves I am over age, or else why would I be handing it to
him? [nicely enough, this shifts all of the risk of the transaction to him,
should it go wrong.]
Similarly, if you booked a flight under the name Nevah Umind, when you hand
over a piece of ID, they look to see it says Nevah Umind (unless, of course,
your name happens to be Nevah Umind) and that's all they want, right?
And if we all booked flights under the same name, then wouldn't that throw
'em WAY off?  Pick a name, DON'T scan your license in, DON'T edit it, DON'T
laminate it, and (for pete's sake!) DON'T use that name.  Their querying
will tell them, "I have a match, he's okay" (These are not the droids you

This is another in my occasional series about Natural Born Killers (NBKs) --
products, services or sites with the genetic potential to become a "killer

of Alexa, a recommendation to use a free product. An NBK nomination is a
recommendation to study a product for the good ideas it contains.
And Alexa stuffs a lot of good ideas into a small toolbar that appears at
the bottom of your browser. This toolbar links back to the company's massive
database, which archives most public Web sites. It also tracks anonymous
usage patterns, so it can analyze what people really do on the Web.

For Gosh sakes, if we didn't know what you were doing, that'd be downright

The toolbar goes along with you as you surf,
(nothing makes me more comfortable than to have a nice tracking device

offering site statistics and a variety of helpful tools. For instance, if
you get a File Not Found error, you can retrieve a previous version of the
