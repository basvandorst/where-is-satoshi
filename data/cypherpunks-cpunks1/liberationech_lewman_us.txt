@_subject: [liberationtech] The zeta radio network 
Apropos to other discussions here, all technology is
dual-use. The AP wrote up some more details about the radio/cell/mesh network used
by the Mexican drug cartels,
I find the word choice of this article more interesting. When activists
do this sort of thing, the network is cobbled together from bits and
pieces and spare parts. When a drug cartel does the exact same thing,
it's a sophisticated, advanced technological engineering exercise.
