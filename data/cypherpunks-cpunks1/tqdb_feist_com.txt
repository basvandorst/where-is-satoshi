I couldn't believe my eyes when reading through Inter at ctive Week's "The Driving Forces of Cyberspace" Top 25 list I saw that Louis J. Freeh, Director of the FBI received an Honorable Mention because of him supposedly believing that "Encryption is an inalienable right."  I suppose that isn't necessarily a lie, but it would need the word "Weak" added on to the front in order to qualify it.  Anyway, I was quite disappointed in seeing their poor choice of this candidate.
