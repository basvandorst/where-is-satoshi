cypherpunks at toad.com 1. go to my site at:
2. look in the 'list of proxies'
3. click on the 'clickable' ones - these are CGI proxies and the first few you come across are working for KSA people at the moment.
That may be enough for you.
If you want more ...
At the same site you might download my findProxyNew.pl which (at least) contains many URLs for lists of proxies.
If you decide to test them, install Perl (URL is on my downloads page), run findProxyNew with $country set to 'KSA' and it will find any you can use from whatever list you feed it.
Expect to find maybe one in 1,000 of the proxies to be any use to you.
If you want even more...
Get a shell account in a free country and run a redirector there, or your own proxy. For the others who responded, these proxies are blocked in the Middle East countries by IP address range (the whole noproxy.com range, for example, including the name server!), by port number (standard ports like 80, 3128, 8080) are blocked and (within the country-wide proxy arrays) by censoring databases of URL strings (for the 'unwanted' URLs, including CGI proxy URLS). My site details all this.
For those cypherpunks who actively believe in freedom of information, the biggest single thing you could do break down this censorship  would be to offer a non-dial shell account, on the understanding that it would be used to run redirectors/relays/bouncers and maybe a proxy (junkbuster, say). I solicited about 10 promising looking ISPs in the USA once, for those who were willing to sell shells under these conditions. I had a response rate of about 20%, and finally only one ISP came through - panix.com. It was just too hard for the rest to bother with; obviously my approach was too honest :-)
