@_subject: Proving I'm not Bob. 
What is this system?  I can't think of any system that wouldn't work if rearranged so that instead of proving you aren't Bob, you simply don't prove that you are.  It is true that they are not isomorphic, and that could be a problem in some situations, but I don't see this as one of them.
