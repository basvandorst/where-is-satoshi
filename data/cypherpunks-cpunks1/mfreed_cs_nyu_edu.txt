@_subject: Tarzan code 
Hi everybody,
So tonight I threw up a tarball of Tarzan's code, after finally updating
it against new releases of its dependencies. It's released under the GPL.
Unlike tor, Tarzan is an IP-layer anonymizing system, so faces different
problems and different complexity. Roger suggested that I announce this
on or-dev.
Unfortunately, I don't plan on continuing developing Tarzan actively
anymore. If anybody else is interested, please drop a line.
....if America were tempted to ''become the dictatress of the world, she would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit.'' What empires lavish abroad, they cannot spend on good republican government at home: on hospitals or roads or schools. A distended military budget only aggravates America's continuing failure to keep its egalitarian promise to itself.

This approach is certainly commonly done by people for useability. However, the problem is that the best security you get is that of security provided by the weakest site (i.e., the weakest link the chain analogy).
As an example, let's say that you use the same password to login to an online banking site (which really cares about security) and some random-dating site (which stores all unencrypted passwords in a big plaintext file on a rootable machine).  An adversary trying to break-in to your bank account doesn't need to subvert the security of the bank site: He just needs to break into the dating site.  No matter how many bits of entropy your password has, you lose.
As a solution developed precisely for this problem, you should check out the pwdhash extension for browsers:
