I thought Kent was a liberal suckup shill, but now I realize he is
merely a stupid jackass. Unless Kent walks around in a semipermanent
state of rectal defilade, having a gun in his posession WOULD have
made a significant difference in each case. A certain amount of
situational awareness IS required to have your gun aimed at the
punk(s) before the punks get the drop on you. Anyone unable to be
aware of their surroundings deserves whatever they get--natural
selection removing stupid genes from the pool and all that.

To make this work really well, link it to the
listening/locating/voiceprinting system described in the "Technology
Secures Gunfire" thread for the purpose of aiming the cameras for
greatest effect.  1984's "Big Brother" wasn't shit compared to this.

Well, you got the edge on me there; I got my first when I was 12, but
my dad let me shoot his .357 Magnum when I was 7.
I recall a period of time when some punks were following me around
because I had ratted on one of their friends. I got tired of it, got a
B-27 silhouette target, and shot out the X-ring with my Para-Ordnance
P10.45. I nailed the used target to my front door, and started wearing
a fanny pack, and it was amazing how the punk sightings diminished
dramatically. I never even had to draw my gun--all I had to do was
convince them I carried one and was willing to use it effectively if
necessary. Of course, if you would rather be shot than live with the
consequences of shooting someone that is your choice. But saying that
having a gun wouldn't make a difference is pretty ignorant--it can
make a HUGE difference IF you are willing to use it--and pay attention
to your surroundings such that you have the gun in hand before you are
in the middle of a circle of assholes with drawn weapons.

I wonder if the courts would buy a "retroactive abortion" defense in
the case of the death of an oppressive official?

*ANONYMOUS*, You could always use the Woodwose Remailer--login to the URL above and
enter userID woodwose and the password jaguar7.  It is a valid return
address (the web interfase allows you to send & receive email), but it
is not connected with a True Name.

I guess the FBI has decided that it is going to be the secret police when
the time comes. (And I had been thinking it was going to be the ATF!) I
wonder if they could be egged into a turf war amongst themselves--if they
are fighting each other, they have less time and energy to fuck with us...
