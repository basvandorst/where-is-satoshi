Whilst I'd agree with most of this article, what it doesn't mention and
which is something that does give rise to a bit of concern is the way that
the Montenegrin government issued a number banking licences a couple of
years ago, took all their fees but not many months later suddenly changed
the law and withdrew the licences, effectively making those banks illegal.
If a government can do this, without recourse to any effective appeal, in
one area, it has the potential to do so in others.

The state has grown used to treating its taxpayers as a farmer treats his
cows, keeping them in a field to be milked. Soon however, in cyberspace, the
cows will have wings...... -- "The Sovereign Individual"
