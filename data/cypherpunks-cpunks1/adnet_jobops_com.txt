@_subject: The secrets to finding ANY JOB on the internet. 
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO FIND A JOB USING THE INTERNET? - If you have been looking for a job, career change or upgrade
find out how internet resources can lead to fifteen interviews
a week or more! Get the job and salary you deserve.
===> Did you know that you can search dozens of newspaper classifieds
     online, and with keywords access the jobs you want 100 times
     faster than if you bought the local newspaper ?
===> Do you know how to effectively use e-mail and fax software to get
     your credentials and resume noticed immediately?
===> Do you know how to use search engines on the internet to find
     hidden job opportunities most people don't know how to look for?
===> Did you know the secrets recruiters use to find jobs for you,      and how you can use them to benefit yourself?
===> Did you know that although there are literally thousands of job      websites, only a scant few dozen actually produce results? Would      you like to know which ones they are?
Whether you are a PhD. in Mechanical Engineering or an Administrative
Assistant with a high school degree, I can show you proven methods
that will generate as many as fifteen interviews a week. My job
hunting manual aptly named "GETTING EMPLOYED IN THE INFORMATION AGE"
will guide you through all the proper steps to take to really push
your career into high gear.
Many of the techniques and search skills taught in my manual will work
for anyone. From phone clerk all the way up to programming
consultants, this guide will help you find and maintain your
livelihood. Also included in this guide:
   ( Sample resumes and techniques are provided in great detail. )
   waste time going there.
I give you the consumer my personal guarantee that what I have written
will help you (if you use it)immeasurably in landing a job. I offer my
text at a very fair and equitable price of $6.95. Don't be fooled by
the low price. Many internet advertisers charge unfair prices for
their merchandise and then take forever to mail it to you. My guide
comes to you as an attached e-mail document in two different file
formats so it will probably reach you three to four days after you
have placed an order.
