A fine piece of work.  The ideas expressed in this paper should scare

which for a fact includes most banks and all investment banks and

i, for one, and perhaps others on the list as well, would be interested in hearing
what you mean when you say, "At&t, Microsoft, etc) who are ripping people off on a daily basis". for example, in what way is AT&T ripping people off? and what about
microsoft? i have no use at all for microsoft, and, being a unix person i don't even
use their stuff, but, i wonder how many people use word, excel, powerpoint, etc
that they ripped-off from someone else, without paying microsoft what they are
due for having developed the products. in general, i suspect that the rip-off is going the other way. after all, no one forces anyone buy from microsoft, AT&T, etc., but people do steal from
them, whenever they have the opportunity. not everyone, of course, but certainly
some do.  these companies provide products and/or services that you are free to purchase or not, as you see fit or can afford.

as i said, i have no use for microsoft, whats more, i don't use microsoft. that said, if a person really must pay to not have their products installed, i agree that that is intorelable, and at the least calls for finding a new vendor
for computers. if you really don't plan to use dos or windows, there is no reason why you should pay for them. frankly, this sounds like a real stupid
move on the part of your hardware vendor. maybe you need to shop around.
as for at&t, no, i don't know the lowest residential rate, but i'm sure that
the rate varies depending on your long distance calling pattern. i'm sure that
the rate is less for someone who rarely makes an ld call but wants to have the ability to do so when and if the need/desire arises then for someone who makes a few call per month and for another user who makes a lot of call each month. at any rate, all you need to do is to ask them for the lowest rate for your calling pattern, and if you don't like the answer, hang up and call mci, s
print, etc. at least thats better than microsoft, where you don't have a lot of choice.
take a quick look around the world, paying particular attention to those many countries where the telephone company was directly controlled by the government. was the service they provided really great? was it cheap? did they every provide anything new or improved?  as one who has spent a lot of time in some of these
countries i can answer from experience, hell no.  a one time, in the late 50's i lived and worked in a certain west african country. th erule was, taht the first
person in the office in the morning would take the phone off the hook, and maybe by 10:30 or 11:00 we would get a dial tone. of course, you would never hang the thing up again taht day, just pass it along to anyone else that needed to make a call.  egypt and all of france was not a lot better. as late as 1983 it was a real challenge to get a phone installed or make a long distance call in france.  no matter what the french say, telecommunications services still suck in france.
i agree with you that a lot of companies do gouge the customer for all that they
can get, and maybe AT&T is one of them, but maybe not.  i have spent my entire working life providing for myself, asking and taking nothing from anyone, other than what i earned for myself. i payed for my education and for everything else that i ever had.  however, once i had the money to invest, i did so, in, among others, AT&T, and since i take a chance with the money that i worked for by investing in them, i, by god, expect a return on my investment, and if AT&T can't provide it, i will dump them and take my chances elsewhere.  however, whether its AT&T or someone else, if i risk my money, i expect something in return, and i can only expect that if the company (AT&T or who ever) makes a
profit.  profit is not a dirty word, it is what makes it all possible. AT&T did not build the worldwide network that serves us all for fun, not did they invent the transistor or UNIX, or all the other thinks that we take for granted just for the fun of it, or without risk.  if you take the risk, you deserve a return on your investment.  i have yet to meet a stockholder who said that they were satisfied with any given profit level and wished the company to give away goods or services rather then increase the dividends to the stockholders.  the name of the game is PROFIT, its what keeps us all alive and employed. the real saving grace is in having a choice.
i am not suggesting that as long as a company makes a profit that anything goes.  what i am suggesting is that a company, or an individual for that matter is
only obliged to see to there own well being.  if an individual so chooses, they
may spend their life, or any portion thereof, working for the good of someone
else, or giving the results of all their labors to others, as they choose.  in many ways this is a good thing and is what makes civilized life.  however, i
do not believe that it is ever permissable to dictate to an individual or to a company which is, after all, only the sum of it's employees and stockholders,
the requirement or terms of how they will dispense the profits of their labors.
if AT&T or any other company doesn't give you what you want, tell them to fuck-off,
and take your business elsewhere.
oh that we could so easily deal with a government that provides so little of what
the people want.  i think that it is rare for a company to forget who is really
calling the shots, but our very own government seems to be completly unaware
that they exist to serve us, not the other way around. they seem to have forgotten
that the purpose of the constitution is not to define what rights are given to the people, but rather to define what powers the people give to the government.

heard about using true random keys, and only once is true.  difficult as it
may be to accomplish,  it is possible to break a otp if the pad isn't really

@_subject: Whats new at Bletchley Park 
I have just returned from spending a week at Bletchley Park, and have the following to report:
On Thursday, 6 June, we had the official switch-on of the rebuilt Colossus. There is still a lot of work to be done on Colossus, but that which is there is definitely working.  What remains is to fill in the holes to expand it to the full five wide system that was the Mark-II machine.
The switch-on was accompanied by a reasonable sized media affair with many of the original Colossus users present.  Also in attendance was Tommy Flowers, the designer of the original, along with his wife and son.  It was the first time that his wife had seen or even heard a lot about Colossus. Dr. Flowers, now in his nineties, has a wonderful memory and is a first class gentleman. It was a real pleasure to spend some time with him. There was a lot of local media coverage, but as yet I have seen nothing in international media, such as The (London) Times or the Financial Times, both of whom were represented at the During this time, I also installed a new Sun Netra-I server at BP.  This server was most kindly donated by Sun Micro Systems.   Many thanks to Scott, who set the direction for this gift, and to Matthew, Michael and Steven at Sun-UK for all their efforts in making this happen.
A four GByte disk farm was also donated by BoxHill Systems.  Thanks to Carol, Ben, Philip, etal at BoxHill for this contribution.
This server will provide Internet and WWW access to BP and will serve as the BP mailhost.  Once we have the communications facilities in place, the server, elgar, will be on-line.  I'll keep the net informed re: our progress in that Once on-line, Tony Sale has a lot of very cool  ideas for web pages, including an interactive, GUI-based  Enigma emulation.  Tony and James Bristow also plan to move their existing Web pages to elgar.
The plans to make BP into a one-of-a-kind museum are well underway.  Many improvements and added facilities have been added since I was there in April, including a nice bar and restaurant in the original Hut Four.  Again I will keep the net up-to-date until the Web server is generally available.  I strongly urge everyone who has the opportunity to visit BP to do so.  At this point they are open every other weekend, but will, at some point in the future, improve on that. If you have any questions, e-mail me, or for 'open weekend status' call BP directly at: (011 44) 1 908 640404.
Many thanks to my friends and colleagues at Bletchley Park; Roger, Peter, Tony, Harry, Margaret, etc, for their hospitality and kindness.

@_subject: Fingerprinting annoyance 
Sometimes it has nothing to do with the employer. For example, for those of us who work on Wall Street, that is to say, in the financial services industry, the SEC requires that all employees submit to a background check, drug test and fingerprint check (National Agency Check) before you can be hired.  Failure to require these checks, and to refuse employment to those that don't pass these test, results in a very large fine for the employer.  This is not a one-time thing.  You must undergo these test
everytime you change jobs, even when moving from one firm to another in the same business.
Many of us find this an onerous process, but for the compensation, (top grade Sys Admins and developers can make >$250,000 per year), many of us put
up with it. This, BTW, does not apply just to traders, etc, but to everyone.  Not only must you put up with all this bull shit, but you must also deal, on a daily basis, with some of the biggest assholes on the face of the earth.  Suffering fools is just the beginning.
We do it all for, $$$, of course.

@_subject: Secret Powers 
i have just completed Secret Powers (reading it, that is).
unless you live in NZ, i don't think that there is much here for you.  even the NZ stuff was pretty tame, unless you have been living under a rock, there is nothing here that wasn't already known.  lots of pictures of NZ politicians and such stuff.  also, a picture of a vax with a caption that implies that these are the NSA's echelon-network computers, sigh.
the author can't seem to stay focused for very long.  also, it's hard to see what his underlying message is, unless, of course, it's simply to sell books and make money, which is in no way a bad thing.  on the one hand, he keeps harping on the theme of how the UKUSA (but really NSA) is forever telling NZ what to collect and what to do,  and how NZ should be their own masters, but then he talks about how very much data NZ receives every day from the NSA.  i guess he never heard the one about the one who pays the piper getting to call the tune.
he also keeps trying to make something sinister about the use of acronyms and code words, and insists that the radomes are to prevent anyone from calculating the look angle and therefore the likely satellites that the dish is looking at.  at another point, however, he mentions how the salt water corrosion destroyed an antenna array, but never seems to be able to figure out that radomes also protect the equipment inside from these very destructive elements.  in general, a lot of nonsense that doesn't every get tied together.
there is also this recurring theme about NZ's independence and it's nuclear-free perhaps there are really people in NZ that care about this stuff, but in this day and age, it's hard to image that there would be.
it's not like the book is poorly written or researched or anything like that, and it's certainly a hell of a lot more than i have done, but otherwise, .......
money isn't  much of a problem to me, so i don't regret buying this book, but if you aren't in the same position, i'd give this one a miss.  better to wait for the new release of The Puzzle Palace.  BTW, does anyone have an update on this? are the authors having friendly chats with the boys from the fort, or something like that?
if however, you really want to read it, the publishers were very prompt about selling me a copy  and shipping it to me via air, and were generally pleasant to deal with.

@_subject: Recent Web site cracks 
The recent cracks of the DOJ, CIA and Dole web sites have caused me to think about just what is going on here.
Do you suppose that these entries were made via the httpd route, maybe via cgi-bin, or just a straight telnet-type entry to the server?  I don't know what operating systems were involved with these three systems, or even if it was the same in all cases.  I expect that there have been other such break-ins that we have not heard about.
The speed with which the attacks are made, and the completeness of the hack seems to indicate that someone knows something.
As a long-time Unix Sys Admin, I am aware that most security holes are due to piss-poor administration, with a few system holes that may be exploited by the reasonably sophisticated, but I am not aware of any glaring holes in the httpd code.  I suppose it's  stupid of me to think this, but I would have though that these three sites in particular, would have cleaned-up their act in this respect.
I suppose that it is possible that there is a route back, through the browser, but this doesn't seem very likely, even with a thoroughly hacked, custom browser.
Does anyone have any ideas about these attacks, how and where the entry was made, which operating systems were involved, etc?
